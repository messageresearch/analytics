one member the sick among us Lord remember brother Addison's our Lord and just reached him touch him then we're brother mark and the different ones there's many many sicknesses among us you said you sent your word and healed us and so we believe it and we thank you for it we love you in Wicca we just commit everything to you now in Jesus name Amen Ephesians 2 verse 5 even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace you're saved and have raised us up together and let us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of His grace in his kindness toward us through Jesus Christ for by grace are you saved through faith now remember what we've been bringing out up here he says that by grace you're saved okay that's wonderful then he comes down and he adds more into his thought and he says for by grace are you saved through faith he's explaining how you're saved right now he's expressing or explaining what salvation is no for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourself is the gift of God not of works lest any man should boast you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now trying to get and I have a hard way of approaching things and you know I'm sorry that's just me but I've tried to get your thoughts into a channel in the Word of God and get you to thinking on that line just like that point Darcy he says you're saved by by faith right but then he comes in adding the point or thought to that you're saved by grace through faith okay now he's explaining more what he's talking about okay are you following me see then there is something about you just say well I I'm saved by faith well that's that's good or you say I'm saved by grace that's good but what I like is Paul with the ability to put them both together and expressing what is taking place in your Christian journey that you're taking because that's what we've been trying to speak about right that by grace are you saved grace is God's unmerited favor okay are you saved through faith in other words you're taking a journey and if you're we're talking about salvation we'll get back to these and expressing it that you you can say the Prophet said one day he said your salvation life's as long as your confession well wait a minute now you you don't seem to believe well we'll get on to that one you know we we're trying to lay a foundation to get to a point see I believe that the Christian journey starts the day you accept Jesus Christ as your Savior all right now that starts your Christian journey okay now through faith okay because see that way then it will keep unfolding and won't stop and Peter you know he says being born again what not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible how by the Word of God which liveth and abideth forever all right so now your Christian journey you're being born again it's not just something that we come up well I've accepted Jesus Christ as my savior you know and 20 years later you said what's your coz I accepted Jesus Christ as my savior you mean there's been no growth development or anything in your journey then I questioned your journey I think water question in our own journey if what we have is not growing within us and has been growing all of our Christian journey we should question what's taking place you know we were discussing this last night you know and the Bible study had a good time about it and see I was trying to say something about that so I believe that that if you you get something starts in the Christian journey and God begins to unveil himself to you it'll never stop it'll keep on going so then as I've always taught you I've always taught this to the church and believe it what's my statement I'd rather go through life seeking God and get out at the end of the journey and find out I had him all the time then to go through life not seeking God and get out the end of the her and find out I didn't have him all right see then what's wrong you say yeah but it you see that's what but if I did I you know no no no it's not trying to get nobody to deny nothing you ever talk to a good old Trinity and he said father neither father deny deny the son no we're not denying nothing we're just talking about the truth I believe your salvation begins but it never ends and what is my finality in the statement of finishing in it all right your new birth starts with your believing and your new birth will end when you're in a total glorified condition body spirit and soul you can truly say then I'm born again but you're not saying that you're not born again before then no but you're in a journey and that's why I've tried to to say it see that it's a journey of Revelation it's a journey of God revealing himself to you you said but but but I you know I can't connect my salvation because that's what we're opposed to be talking on right I can't connect my salvation to any revelation the way you seem to talk about you know that that we need a revelation well I'm not the one who doing the talking the prophets one that said you know what is the new birth brother on Christ the mystery he said it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you well now then it's not to every one of us you know as one we're Gentiles we're coming in you know the we ever want I was reading this morning where the Prophet says everbody must have their own experience all right then I believe now listen I believe because what I've always tried to teach I believe it's what the Bible teaches that everybody's new birth is the same every babies born the same you said no this doing well we're talking with normal babies we're talking about the Syrians we talking about this that or the other we're talking about it in the line of normal birth of a child it's water blood and life all right we'll get to that and am I asking you if you would have asked you to read it over and over and then you go back to the future home and read it start and read about the first 20 pages especially because we're gonna try to the Lord when's the Lord's coming Wednesday we'll try to move in to our thought more you know to Express we're talking about alright but see what is faith you said well I've never had a revelant what did the man say what brother Brown said the man said we can excel revela he said then you can't accept Jesus Christ you don't believe in revelation youi you can't be saved because the Bible says upon this rock this revelation he said he would build the church well it's built on the revelation of Jesus Christ that's what we're talking about this by Sunday see there's no promise in the Bible of the Holy Ghost to come upon you under Father Son and Holy Ghost but under the Lord Jesus Christ at least you've got a promise right see you come to a promise you're putting it to the basis that depend upon what God says about it alright so if I can get to a promise I like that okay but see now get this point we'll try to move into the thought we must accept Jesus Christ as our Savior all right but then he must accept us and that's kind of you know to people that have not paid attention to those thoughts you know it's just a lot of people think salvation is just I accepted Jesus Christ and that's it well now how are you going to put it together with all of the scripture if that is just your thought well what happened brother Dale well you ought to remember what happened well I've never had an experience well yeah I mean II won't we read the brother on said ever born-again believer must have the experience of the new birth well I'll probably bread rather see this we're not talking about evidences we're not talking about that I believe God was real before ever heard of this message right but I don't count none of that as being my experience many things happen but I count none of that is my experience I have an experience that is word related so they don't have to worry about it yeah those disciples we'll get to this later in talking about it those disciples spent three and a half years going through justification and sanctification you wouldn't just a haphazard journey it wasn't just one thing they all run up to Pentecost got the Holy Ghost how come there's only 120 got it there were the only ones that had come through justification and sanctification is that sensible you'll see that as we relate it together to Jesus and doing like a ask them life's not about it you've got to have the three stages of grace right but how come Jesus said you got to be born of water and spirit that's only two I'd like to make you think I'd like to make you consider something because Jesus says you're born to water I'm a spirit okay but we believe in justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost well I've always just been told about like I do believe the Prophet I wouldn't the one that taught these things so I would suggest you listen to the Prophet is more what I'm saying you know to listen to him express what the new bird really is now remember he was born the Prophet that right that didn't make him saved they must be more to the journey than just to believe I wasn't him that said he said I'd have been saved when I was 12 years old if it hadn't been for that demon hanging there now do we listen to him all that what he's saying do you say yeah but he was right he was he's born a prophet but there was a lot of those people that were born prophets especially not Old Testament group of people because all of those prophets were born prophets but none of them had the baptism when the Holy Ghost because they never made it to penticoff even the great John the Baptist never made it to the Upper Room experience the Upper Room experiences the new birth now don't you think they had a great understanding of the Word of God don't you think that even you get in I believe this in Luke and then especially when you get into revelaed me know the book of Acts then he opened their understanding of the scriptures well that's all I need to get saved just get my understanding of the scriptures open well now according to the Bible go read it he opened their understanding of the scriptures he does it then he comes on back over to the group and opens their understanding of the scriptures and they're still not saved they prove they're not safe because they say an ax 1 are you going to restore the kingdom now to Israel they didn't know what he was talking about he says you don't understand what we were saying about Nicodemus Nicodemus couldn't understand when Jesus was saying you must be born again but do you understand what it means come on do you understand what the new birth is well I just all I've ever done just believe the word well that's a good point but now that's quoting their moment ago but jesus said upon this rock I'll build my church upon this revelation so we're saved by grace through faith which is a revelation you can't be saved according to that my vision I got these laying here I read them over and over to you and they're on the internet so anybody out dark and pull them up and read them you can't be saved without it being a revelation I don't understand that Brazil cuz I've never got no revelation number one you might not know what you're talking about and trying to understand what you need and what I mean by der the Prophet means by it number two you might not have it well I'll tell you whom I don't like you talk to me like that you know my whole life is built on believing brother Branham was a prophet well I'm reading or quoting to you what your prophet said I'm quoting the Bible that says you're saved by grace through faith well that's just true believin that's a good start in the right direction but it ain't a finish to the story when it says you're saved by grace through faith that's not just believing to say well I believe it well what else you think I'm supposed to do believe God until God believes you right that's the best way to say it did your prophet teach each other way you salv accepted Jesus Christ as my savior he said but as he accepted you well I didn't know I had to that's what we were discussing a little eyes not see God waited ignorant until the truth is presented but once the truth is presented we have no right to be ignorant anymore faith is a revelation and you can't be saved without a revelation I tried my best to explain something I'll get back to it more than it I've never attempted to explain a lot about my experience but I tried to a little bit last night you see if you don't have a revelation you don't have the new birth you show up or picture does well I'll tell you what to I'd rather go and face you at judgment on the basis of me trying to tell you the truth than have to face you Darwin I wouldn't tell you the truth I guess the tickle of these preachers they say boy it's hard being a preacher it ain't hard to preach like most people preach you just believe the message you're on your way to heaven everything took care of glory hallelujah make sure you pay it out right it's hard to preach the truth it's easy to preach a life there's no problem with preaching a life me it's hard to preach the truth to get the truth settle down into our hearts and lives to where we won't argue back with it well brother Taylor I didn't know we had to have how long have you been in this church because this is what I've talked for nearly fifty years I've taught it this way and I believe it you've got to have a definite experience of justification the disciples did you've got to have a definite experience of sanctification the disciples did and by only of those two things being in manifestation in their lives khadiyah could they qualify for going to the upper room to receive the experience well you sound like you mean it I need to be justified sink if I'd feel with all I thought that that was what it was some of you come from Pentecost that's bad listen time we didn't teach you about justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost right we didn't even know the words we just believed we got it all one will bleed I accepted Jesus Christ as my savior and you can't tell me I'm saved I'm not trying to tell you I'm sorry I'm trying to tell you you lost souls brown you see maybe that's one of it okay go on being born again it means a process is taking place right you're in a journey and in that journey you're traveling the journey is a journey by faith or you're saved by grace but it's through faith now I'm gonna say it this way but I hope you'll keep it in line and thought it's really not to just say by faith but that's true that's alright we'll go along with it but just remember it's not just by faith well I'm saved by faith don't say by grace through faith if my journey of a Christian stops I prove I never was right to start with that's all I've tried my best to say to you all I've ever tried to say to you if you started out believing and you quit believing what happened the because it's not supposed to be that way a child is born into the world and it starts a journey of living if it stops it dies well is any problem with your prophet then saying he said people use the word salvation so loosely in other words until he said you say well I'm saved I tell you what I'm saved I believe I'm saying and the evidence I'm saved is I believe the message well let me ask you this question in a simple matter but yet what did you believe before you heard the message I had great experiences and things happening and the great understanding before I heard of the message I've tried to teach you those things and get you to understand there was a lot of people had a lot of understanding of the Word of God before the Prophet ever came on the scene he didn't start a lot of the doctrines that everybody thinks the Azusa Street were Pentecostals we yet they believed in the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they all they didn't everyone come up that's why you've got you won this is your tune assisting you this that or the other because of the way some of them believed in some stopped and they're believing well what if you stopping you're believing I'm just trying to be sensible because you to think about it do you know you're born again well I know I've done everything I can do uncle let's remember life Sunday when Cain What did he say that around him said name said I've done all I'm gonna do you take it or leave it well we know what happened that was where he made his worst mistake right because God didn't take it well I believe God I believe God and I've tried to live a good life amen thank God you showed me where a good life is reestablishing I thought it was an outward work I thought works and good things and doing right was an outward work of an inward work that had taken place well I didn't know I needed to be saved I thought I was saved yeah what do you know you're saved come on do you really know you whether you're saved or not and what on what basis do you put it I put don't believe in the Prophet now wait a minute let's get what the Prophet said the evidence of the holy ghost was what he said whether or not the spirit now he used it in their different ways and brought it okay but what did he say that ain't that the Lord straightened him out in a vision about it and what did he say so that's the last one and if anyone whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word he didn't say whether or not the spirit and you agreed with the word agrees which means never stops being born again means you started a journey and you never stopped growing in grace and knowledge means that you're in just in that journey as you're traveling I'm trying to get you to just think well I don't like it what you doing go here you just you just put it to how do you still handle hope I would to God I could preach it that hard I would to God I could preach it so hard that everybody in this building and me myself would fall on our knees and cry out under God and try to get an answer from him this is not to play pretties and go to oh where but with brother brother sword so he's so sweet we'll go with him he's got no problems I didn't invite you here and I didn't say that wrong now people are welcome to come here but I didn't go out and get nobody and they some been here that's been women for 40 years around me at least they know I ain't never tried to do nothing but one thing I screamed and hollered about salvation all of these years but what do you teach your children well brother Dale don't understand he's he's a little hard yeah he's he's a little Stern about it well that may be true but is it the truth what I say do you teach your children you need to be warned again or is it like that I've always said to you about the the she bars it ate up the children with Elijah you know why they ate up the children because the children sat down and listened and mom and daddy was sitting at the table and they were saying why don't old ball head going up get the heaven and get away leave us alone them children just went out and said what mama and daddy didn't got ate up oh I don't like that good see you later I'm serious this is not trying to build anything a kingdom really it's trying to see whether or not we're born again my brother Dale I like it when you're on the see older than the plague hey I thought this was the seals enough time I thought salvation was the only thing we had that's the only doctor and I know the seals if it's the part of your journey it was part of runarounds journey he started then he went into this and went into that you need to skip under message this kept unfolding to him I thought that was what was supposed to happen to me in you what I was saying about you know you're gonna face brother branham about it not me yeah I mentioned seventy weeks of Daniel people I wouldn't know one that said in that book he said if you don't understand this Daniel seventy weeks you will not understand the seals it's in the book read it well I don't have to understand that I didn't say you did but what if you do I thought that the prophets said the bride was to be delivered of a new birth from according to Malachi 4 so it seems to be delivered of a new birth according to Malachi 4 then that's not no childish doctrine there would be the entire message of Malachi 4 that we are to believe that God can bring it forth what about it will you sound like that I need to do something and all I've been taught out of my life they just believe well let me ask you one question what have you been taught to believe oh we've been taught to believe bread Randall was a prophet amen why is everybody falling away down why are they leaving it why are the ones that brought you into the message of maybe or leaving it evidently something went wrong see faith is a revelation you need me to read these to you faith your prophet said is a revelation it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you but a writer like I said the disciples went three and a half years with the Lord Jesus teaching them the message right and then they went to the upper room what if they had not a had to three and a half years prior why would they not 4,000 in the upper room why was it not gonna at least what does the Scriptures tell us about he was seen of over 500 brethren or something like that after his resurrection why didn't they make it to the upper room right come on I'm quoting scripture he was seen of more than 500 brethren it and he called them brethren which means believers but evidently didn't believe or not to make it to the upper room you cannot be saved without a revelation because the new birth is a revelation the birth of the word the prophet says spoken word regional seed is the new birth the birth of the word there's your new birth well I just talked to just any understanding right then words you get to thoughts from well I I don't I just don't know what you're talking about I'll just go somewhere that's where I can understand the Lord be with you and me too but that's his honest as I can be I believe the new birth is the birth of the word what do you believe well it's just I just I just believe God well I thought God was the word so don't play games with me you're just trapping your own selves you're running around and around if the new birth is a burst of the word and God is the word what does heat waters brother Dale talking about what is your prophet talking about he said if your salvation you're believing stops he said then you lost your salvation I can't believe that cuz I believe it I believe once saved always saved well that's good bad news have you taught your children salvation do they know what it is to be saved well maybe mom and daddy don't know no more than to just say I believe well what do you believe I'm kind of like it fellow would any there's a BAP tighter than a minute you kept saying do you believe and put him down run him up you believe put him down brought him up you believe you got nothing holding me I believe you trying to drown me see you can get a believer out of something in a hurry right but what do you believe but I don't I don't need to know these things I'm just - I'm just simple brother Dale there's a lot of differences being a simple and stupid but they do go in the same category but just think about it now what I've been driving at and then we'll pick up later to try to get any more interesting points of talking about justification sanctification the baptismal oligos and to try to find out if we've ever experienced those fun have you ever had an experience of justification would you know what it is if you've never had it if it ain't talked to you how do you know what it is if it ain't been talk to you how do you know what it is if you ever went to a preacher and said what in the world you talking about went one sister here for years and asked her one day I didn't she went to another Church you know and I didn't bother me none I was friends with her nice try said what his brother so-and-so preached on the souls he said I don't know he never heard him saying I mean you go to a message church for years and know nothing about a soul you know nothing about salvation you know nothing about being born again what's wrong but yes you know everything else right you know everything else well what if your children ask you sir what is salvation could you express it to them could you explain salvation to eight ten twelve fourteen year old child will just believe the Lord that's all dear just believe the Lord I see you boom brother Dale was talking about something else because he seems to be talking about more than just believing what's he talking about you see that's why I'm not accepted at that basis I don't preach like the other preachers all the others wonder I mean saying although man is saying most of them they preach what don't do this do that don't do this don't do that just you do they believe this except that you know that wouldn't want to ask in the Bible's are they said what must we do to be saved what just believe run around with a prophet believe the word I know I shouldn't say a lot of things but I'm I mean here as a human being too we send our children to places and they hear doctrines talk do we correct the doctrines when they come back home that's all I'm asking you you hear dr. install some of you come told me that they did teach them things you know maybe the kids talking okay let your kids talk back tell them the truth and tell them to tell them the truth let them solve it it might be like one sister said one time she's been there was a meeting and all in in that they said something in this said she'd been after talking a good bit and this feller he said I know where you go to church he said you do he said yeah you go to brother Dale's in Lula Georgia says because I can hear him talking through what you're saying well isn't that a wonderful situation that we could have the answer to a lot of questions that people out that our children and it's not based upon what they said just believe it I've never had a revelation you'll say brother there well what's wrong we you mean God has never spoke to use never reveal nothing to eat come on they don't have to be a great time sisters come on all it can be is this you don't need to getting supposed to cut you higher that's a revelation now whether you believe it or not that's how simple I teach because why do you have to tell the women there's wrong to cut to her wear their pants and do this I know when your prophet says you didn't have to once they got born again well why don't we get them born again well not brother Dale they from around here yeah and I'm not a dummy I can look at higher cuts her don't grow straight across in the back okay if I was you I'd wise up a little bit okay now come on if I was you I'd wise up a little bit if my daughter wanted to have her hair cut she'd have it could in a V she wouldn't have it cut straight across because when you cutting the straight across and automatically admits you cut it at least you can lie a little bit and let them cut it at an angle brother Dale you're stupid I agree with you but it's better than to be so silly right what about it what is your revelation if you ever had a revelation of Eva come ooon is that what the Prophet said did he tell the story about the man that whenever were trying to find Christ he had to plant you know he read about it where were you spend eternity or something anyone ever were trying he went to old robbers doing all of them you come back to brother Brandon what we run say you had it all time said cuz when you picked up that track you made a decision well do you believe here profit he said that was the salvation what if your salvation is based upon what you believe I believe it is I'm not questioning to myself for the profit or the Bible I'm questioning you what is your revelation could you explain one God to somebody without saying the profit sale Yeah right come on you don't throw me wrong I throw back at you don't start stuff on me like what you don't believe the brother I believe more than you think about brother branham but you see I set and look and read setting yesterday and setting this morning reading for the Prophet said it's not what you do it's not what these things are he said it's not how good you are and that's why I'm calling that phrase right there you don't want us to live good no won't you get born again i thrown in there you hear that and you say well brother l don't believe in living good now you lied I didn't say that I believe in getting born again then I believe in being born again that that journey just starts when you start you're believing but what's wrong with the most of people is what your prophet said when you stop believing you lose your you lose your confession you lose your salvation but you see can they take a Trinity in deprogram you well you know what the new birth then if that can't be done the new birth has something to do with the revelation of God's Word to you there's reading the one overlaying here where veteran says the only way you can be a son or daughter of God is by revelation given unto you which is a birth we claim to be his children but know nothing about what he taught us then go ahead but see it'll all be gonna be a Whooper quick cuz we know we can't keep on the way we're going I may never made no dates they ain't never set none never worried about it but there's one thing for sure it's gonna be over with and we're gonna face our maker and I ain't gonna face him with the blood of any of you on to me that won't tell you the truth about it don't try to convince me you're born again cuz that wouldn't help you got me convinced I wouldn't have nothin a revelation that around said it's got to be revealed to you he said the only way you could be saved is by revelation what do you mean we come up to the altar brother Dale and we cried and we prayed now listen to her this is how simple we're gonna try to have to make it your salvation didn't start up here at the altar now come on don't misquote me on the quotes and then I can quote - but don't do that take what I'm saying you leave the all the seat and you come to the front and you get prayed for your salvation didn't begin here it begun back there because there's where you made your decision right your decision was made when you stood up brother Brendan said raising your hand he said it's impossible to raise them without some spirit moving it see your salvation begin maybe in the middle of the night last night as you were thinking about where am I saved or not - word begin come on close the prophet how did they explain it when you get up and start towards the front he said right darts where it was that cause you made your decision the other is manifestation and things happening through your journey do you really have the new birth well brother Dale I have to agree that it don't go along with everything you say well now of what did I say if I said what the Prophet said and the Bible says we ain't got no argument because your own wrong ground trying to talk to me that way if I got it in the word and got it the prophets message don't try to get me to change it but don't you think no no don't have no thoughts but could it be brother Dale that that we've all this time we've tried to and brother Branham would and really a prophet is that what you're saying there what it what is your point is your salvation based purely upon brother Branham was a prophet or is it fate was it based on the Lord Jesus Christ and salvation which one you try to put everything and I'm putting his honest I can be you try to put everything up on what you believe but what do you believe you believe today and tomorrow you don't believe as I said we'll finish this journey probably 20 year or 20 messages from now but my whole point is one thing you realize we're showing what we are we're producing what we are we're showing the world what we are maybe that's why your children don't want the message no no no you shouldn't talk like that now why well you don't never do nothing wrong yeah I do a lot wrong what do you got it what are you trying to make it on well maybe the children don't want the message we claim because we don't present it correctly we making it a book of rules or an idea or a thought like that instead of making it a revelation of Jesus Christ because that's what I told them last night and I mean it I don't care what they prove brother branham was wrong here brother branham was this brother Brown was married ten times brother branham was all this at the other I don't care because the message he brought has brought me to Christ what about you are you willing to put it that away well no brother they live quite that strong and because a brother so-and-so said brother branham was wrong here and I can't disprove it well so what they said Jesus was wrong but Jesus brought God to a human element to worry could make a sacrifice for you and I to where we could live a Christian life I thought that's what the Prophet was trying to do not to try to make us a bunch of good people or this that or the other but to make us born-again Christians that loved the Lord Jesus in our heart and don't matter what anybody else said about it you sound like you don't know what run around true enough that's up to you I don't have no problem my answer is my answer I don't care what they can say I appreciate that Baptist preacher that led me to Jesus Christ and I was in a Baptist Church what about you I went back and thank them folders for helping me you ever done that I'm talking about some of them preachers I said under I thanked him for helping me someone's been in this message just turned me out and kicked me away and everything else I've went to him and said thank you for helping me if you got enough salvation to do that ain't gonna thank that brother he run me out of the church thank God for running me out of the church I don't understand you see that's what I mean you don't understand me because you don't understand salvation you got salvation based on some kind of goody-goodies and it's that of the other instead of putting it on the truth of the word I have no problems with the Pope of Rome but I said I'll call him my brother he said this ain't gonna kiss his toe he's not calling brother blessed gone ain't calling a potent oh brother you're not saved oh no salvation puts Christ in you that overlooks whatever thing else he is how can your testimony win the Pope has to try to be a Christian if you don't give him some opportunity I thought we were such overshoe of Christianity that's that's what I said this is 20 sermons down the road I thought our life was to show Christianity of the world maybe that's why some of you your wives your husband's and your families don't want the message you shouldn't talk like that brother to hell well I don't have to worry about it it's not enough been that good about it and if not my wife's been that good about it but all of our children sitting here today where's yours now you're hurting feelings praise God I hurt your feelings you'll do something about it if I don't hurt your feelings you'll go on this earth well I'm goody-goody I miss that in the other I've done the best I can do you ain't doing the best you can do and I didn't do the best I could do right but I tried my best teach the children this meant yeah you said it home and teach the children about the messy we're not supposed to get that away brother yeah you said at home and try to tell them how good the message is you're a lying hypocrite now that's more than being lost Rodell you just called me a hypocrite a liar hey man is it true like I said about Elijah them kids heard that from somebody and then when our turns got killed they already took the momma's and daddies out and fed them to the bar come on it's time to either start living the Christian life and being with Christ I just quit right just quit you don't run people off I didn't run you in I ain't trying to run nobody off you just don't understand me I'm trying to save you let's look back here and I see some things and happening around here and a certain little old sister sitting here today and she quit coming to church and her two kids told her said mama that and I'm preaching what them are Lula we need to get back to Lula well you know what they back in Lula now thank you boys keep telling mama what to do yep that ain't hurt her because they told her the truth bless God you ain't gonna tell me that I do wrong kids why not if you're wrong come on what are you talking about I'm talking about one thing salvation is a journey it starts but it'll never end until we walk out of this world and when we walk out of this world it will be just the beginning that's how wonderful I think this message has brought Jesus Christ off the pages of the book I read the book I could quote see the book I could quote them the book I did I stayed in trouble all the time because I just tell people what the book said I thought we're supposed to believe the book and what the book said why did your profits at anyway he said you know I'm tell a woman this wrong cut her heart or why pants or which one is I know there's a direct quote the one part you don't have to tell the woman why cuz come on the church then you women you just sat down and grin for a little bit and think about it you don't have to tell you that it's wrong to do you know better okay let's kill knows that hey brothers how about it you know better well brother deal I just don't like you I never have liked myself let alone like anything yet but is it the truth of what I've said that's all I'm asking you salvation according to Jonah what is it two and nine of leaders are salvation is of the Lord we're talking about salvation salvation is deliverance salvation is a journey we started our journey when we started believing the Word of God and that journey brought us now you can sit back and look at it and think about we'll go through some of these and look where you come from to bring you into the message and to think what aggression God we have that would drop all the way down to where we had say it this way without you getting offended there is no grace in a prophetic message now listen to what I'm saying and don't just misunderstand it there's no grace in a prophetic message it is law because it's the word that says to do or don't do bring that prophet with his message to the New Testament and it becomes Grace but not disgrace right come on how many of you remember back about probably 70 somewhere in there they started out about you know that brother Branham was an Old Testament prophet in a New Testament age I mean have you remember that before that be something that's what I told him I said I told him just what I say at this then I said boy ain't that something he's an Old Testament prophet so they ain't no grace in anything he says because he's a law teacher if he's a prophet of the Old Testament you better get him in the New Testament where you're at you get him where you're at then you can claim salvation then you'll understand come on musicians anybody got any thoughts about what I say I'll be glad to set in the office and listen to you we're glad for you to tell me where I'm wrong but you tell me if I'm wrong about salvation you tell me I'm wrong about the things that I believe that the prophet of God taught us he's the one that taught us that we're in a journey traveling through life he's the one that taught us that we're saved by grace through faith and as long as that salvation is the correct confession then it'll work but if not it'll stop well I always thought it once saved always saved that's true if you're once saved if you're once truly saved you're always saved that's true but if you're not saved better find a website version okay what do you think about it well I think brother Dale I'm massively confused good that gives you something to pray about I just don't understand you well good that'll give you something to pray about and while you're praying about that pray for me okay cuz contrary to what your thinking is I don't want nobody to be lost and I don't care who they are I want them saved I would to God the devil could be saved you know I don't hate him that away it it's kind of hard to listen to the Prophet sometimes and you know the Prophet how did he stated about the devil he's the best friend we got per phrasing it right but that's right isn't it devil is the best friend we got you know why cuz he's gonna get on our back and he's gonna beat us to death and he's gonna do all kind of things yeah but he ain't my buddy no he ain't my buddy but he's doing a good job trying to line us up well you love the devil no don't love the devil but he's a mighty good devil and he's doing his job what are we gonna do bless God devil I ain't gonna listen to you well and where do we go ahead brother let's stand together you say I don't understand what you're saying all right we'll take it up we find many people who take it up with Lord willing winds that will try to drop back to where where everyone live out and start with a simple plan of salvation let's see if we can be saved let's see if we are saying [Music] this is like ever I crossed over Jordan to Cain and Stanley and this is like heaven to me when I get me I finish out [Music] but I'm filled with the spirit there is a lot doubt and this is like heaven to me discover that will it stop like heaven [Music] this is like a nice to look in the journey I've crossed over Jordan to Cain and swear let's happen in history as one like heaven to me and it's curve alcohol old this is like heaven to me this this is like heaven to me I've crossed over [Music] and this is like heaven to me we find many people who can understand why and they understand how we crossed over Jordan to Canaan Zipit Holly when we tell them this is like hey I can't understand this oh this is like lemon to me oh this is like heaven to me broths to overturn this find out whether your shoulder and this is whatever just find out whether you're saved or not if you're concerned about it then pray about it why would you be concerned well brother Dale you just sound like you're trying to make us all lost I wish I could then we do something bout it let me do something about it and get serious [Music] father we thank you for today and I would like to say is Lord and or said it wrong I know I said what I shouldn't say it an order said other things but those wonders are in my heart Lord and that's for all of us to come to the basis of realize that whether we're saved or whether we're lost and that way we can do something about it don't be blaming everybody else there will be everybody else's fault it'll be our own fault Lord you just pour out upon us the things that are needed to bring us to that basis to understand you in your ways we love you we thank you in Jesus name you're dismissed gave up their land and this is like heaven to me oh this is like never praise God this is like heaven to me Wow crossed over Jordan to Keenan's fair land and this is
