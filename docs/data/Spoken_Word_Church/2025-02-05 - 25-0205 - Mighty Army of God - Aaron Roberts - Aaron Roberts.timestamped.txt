[5:37] a little short testimony and I don't
[5:39] want to keep you standing for too long
[5:40] but I just want to give a quick
[5:41] testimony when brother Andrew Glover was
[5:44] here and brother Wade and I we prayed
[5:47] over a prayer cloth for a young man that
[5:48] I'm that I work
[5:50] with and he's going through his second
[5:54] round of
[5:55] rehab he's he's had he's had a rough
[5:58] life there's a lot of a lot of things
[6:00] that's went on but he's trying to get
[6:03] right with God he's trying to get
[6:04] straight in his life he's got two little
[6:06] girls he's trying to he's trying to live
[6:09] a better life for
[6:11] them and he was in he was in this rehab
[6:15] facility and it's a 12-month program
[6:18] that that he was going through and he
[6:19] went through about four months of it and
[6:23] you know he's already been through
[6:25] through one rehab this is his second
[6:27] time this has been a number of years ago
[6:28] and now he's in this other
[6:30] and at the end of last year there was a
[6:32] lot of stuff that went on and he was
[6:34] telling me about some of it I was just
[6:36] like I don't understand it and he was he
[6:38] was very worried about it he very
[6:39] concerned about it and I told all we can
[6:41] do is pray about it and put it in God's
[6:43] hands so we got a prayer cloth and I
[6:46] give it to him and he had to go because
[6:48] he got kicked out of this second program
[6:50] he got he had to go see probation and
[6:53] all that and judges could have and the
[6:55] judge could have revoked his
[6:57] rehab and all of that seen him to jail
[7:01] and I was like
[7:02] well we don't know but you know we're
[7:04] going to pray over it and trust God and
[7:07] we don't know why things happened but
[7:09] they happened for a
[7:10] reason and so he was very concerned but
[7:12] he was really appreciative of the prayer
[7:14] cloth and I said so we keep praying for
[7:17] him well he went they give him two weeks
[7:21] a week and a half passed and he got into
[7:23] a new
[7:23] rehab he's in a rehab that he was in the
[7:26] first time so now he's he's already
[7:28] completed 12 12 months in this other one
[7:31] and I was like when one door closes God
[7:33] will open another one but you don't see
[7:36] why it's that way and I said but God
[7:39] wants you to trust
[7:41] him we had a meeting in this other rehab
[7:45] that he's went to he's already been
[7:47] there 12 he's already completed several
[7:49] years ago he completed 12 months he got
[7:52] in this one and he had a meeting and
[7:55] they told him because you done so well
[7:57] the first time you went through this
[7:58] 12-month program
[8:00] and he gets like credits I guess because
[8:02] he went through this first one they say
[8:04] he can complete his second rehab in 6
[8:08] months and I told him I said see I said
[8:11] you thought because when he got before
[8:13] he got kicked out of the second one they
[8:15] wanted him to do six four more months so
[8:17] he would have been 16 months in that and
[8:20] then they kicked him
[8:22] out well then I said see if You' had
[8:25] original 12 months if you complete the
[8:27] next 6 months with the four that you've
[8:29] already done
[8:30] that's only 10 months so you'll be done
[8:32] instead of having to wait till next year
[8:34] I said by the end of the summer you can
[8:36] be finished on this
[8:38] one so you know it's like that's God
[8:42] working and y'all and y'all continue to
[8:44] pray for him you know he's the one that
[8:46] come to me and and I was like if if I
[8:49] had $5 do you believe I'd give you
[8:51] $5 and he said yes I said well you don't
[8:54] know if I got
[8:56] $5 but you trust me enough that but if I
[8:59] had it I'd give it to you because you
[9:02] take me out my word I said the creator
[9:05] of Heaven and Earth came down and took
[9:08] on the form of Flesh and died in your
[9:10] stead to take away your sins and it's a
[9:12] free gift all you got to do is
[9:17] believe and I said that is the same God
[9:20] that's standing right here in the M
[9:22] between you and I talking right now
[9:24] because you say well I've done too much
[9:26] no listen there as long as you're
[9:28] drawing bread
[9:29] and you believe what the Bible says
[9:31] there is nothing going to stop you to
[9:34] receive the Forgiveness of God he will
[9:36] cleanse you he will forgive you you got
[9:40] to have faith in what God Said right
[9:44] amen and see the devil wants you to stop
[9:47] believing what he said am he's going to
[9:50] put everything in in your way to stop
[9:52] you
[9:53] amen but I I I believe it just just as
[9:56] much as the ground I'm standing on
[10:00] and you know it's so
[10:03] simple we got to because it's like you
[10:05] can't worry about what went on in the
[10:07] past you got to realize this
[10:09] inexhaustible
[10:11] Fountain will take away all of that amen
[10:14] and if you believe he said he put it in
[10:16] his SE of forgetfulness never to be
[10:18] remembered
[10:19] anymore amen so y'all just continue to
[10:21] remember him and uh he's he's still got
[10:24] his daily struggles look like we all do
[10:26] but i' start I've starting to really see
[10:28] a change in he's trying to read the
[10:29] Bible and he's
[10:31] uh he's
[10:33] like he said there's a lot of things I
[10:35] don't understand so I give him the uh I
[10:38] give him the uh the children's version
[10:41] sometimes so we talk about people in the
[10:42] Bible and I just I just break it down
[10:44] and I tell him like a children's story
[10:46] and I just give him people's names and
[10:47] he's like oh I ain't never read that
[10:48] before and I was like well sometimes
[10:50] it's easier if you just go find a kids
[10:52] book that tells the story and gives you
[10:54] everybody's name and tells you the
[10:55] highlights and you catch some of those
[10:57] things while you're trying to read in
[10:59] the Bible I said I don't know if they
[11:00] ever made cliff notes for the Bible but
[11:02] if they did you could cut the synopsis
[11:04] of some of this to help you with some of
[11:06] the stories but I mean it's really but
[11:08] you just keep praying and keep pressing
[11:10] on and and the Lord will bring you
[11:12] through amen well let's just uh speak to

[12:14] your hand in the name of Jesus Christ
[12:17] amen Exodus 13 and we're going to begin
[12:20] at Verse 18 and it says but God led the
[12:23] people about through the way of the
[12:25] Wilderness of the Red Sea and the
[12:27] children of Israel went up went up
[12:30] harnessed out of the land of Egypt and
[12:32] Moses took the bones of Joseph with him
[12:34] for he had straightly sworn the children
[12:36] of Israel saying God will surely visit
[12:39] you and ye shall carry up my bones away
[12:41] hence with you and they took their
[12:43] Journey from suth and encamped in ethm
[12:48] in the edge of the Wilderness and the
[12:50] Lord went before them by day in a pillar
[12:53] of a cloud to lead them the way and by
[12:56] night in a pillar of fire to give them
[12:58] life to go by day and night he took not
[13:02] away the pillar of the cloud by day nor
[13:06] the pillar of Fire by night from before
[13:08] the people amen and we go to Ephesians
[13:11] chapter 6 and beginning at verse
[13:17] 10 I think I think actually I think I
[13:19] might have said 11 but if that's all
[13:21] right we'll just we'll just read
[13:25] 11 yeah verse 10 says finally my
[13:28] brethren be strong in the Lord in the
[13:30] power of His
[13:31] might and it says put on the whole armor
[13:34] of God that you may be able to stand
[13:36] against the Ws of the devil for we
[13:38] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[13:41] against principalities against Powers
[13:43] against the rulers of the darkness of
[13:44] this world against spiritual wickedness
[13:46] in high places wherefore take unto you
[13:49] the whole armor of God that you may be
[13:51] able to withstand in the evil day and
[13:53] having done all to stand stand therefore
[13:55] having your loins G about with truth and
[13:58] having on the breast plate of
[13:59] righteousness and your feet shot with
[14:01] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[14:04] above all taking the shield of Faith
[14:06] where wherewith you shall be able to
[14:09] quench all the fiery darts of the wicked
[14:12] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[14:15] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[14:17] God Amen God bless you you may be seated
[14:19] tonight I want to take this little
[14:21] thought tonight on a mighty Army of
[14:25] God and here in if in Exodus we go back
[14:30] Exodus chapter 13 here and it's speaking
[14:33] of the children of Israel coming out
[14:36] of out of
[14:38] Egypt and the the scripture says uh one
[14:43] thing I I've always when I read this uh
[14:46] something always kind of stands out to
[14:48] me uh where it says they came out
[14:51] harnessed they came up harnessed out of
[14:53] the Wilderness and you know if you go
[14:56] back and look at the word harnessed it
[14:58] actually means to be equipped for battle
[15:01] they actually had on their armor they
[15:03] were actually armored to go into battle
[15:06] when they came out of Egypt now other
[15:09] translations if you look at other
[15:11] translations it'll actually say they
[15:13] came out in battle formation they
[15:15] because they were ready to battle when
[15:17] they came out of Egypt to March out but
[15:21] if we go back and look at verse 17 of of
[15:23] chapter 13 it it says and it came to
[15:27] pass when pharaoh had let the people go
[15:30] that God LED them not through the way of
[15:33] the land of the Philistines although
[15:35] that was near for God said lest pre
[15:38] Adventure the people repent when they
[15:40] see war and they return to
[15:44] Egypt now we we see here that when God
[15:48] is bringing them out and you see that
[15:50] the children of Israel all the things
[15:51] that you know they had been through and
[15:53] all the things that they had seen and
[15:55] God had done all the Miracles and you
[15:57] know they were in bondage all these
[15:59] years and they they saw the things that
[16:01] took place and you know when when you
[16:03] see these things that they're coming out
[16:05] with and the scripture says that they
[16:07] brought the bones of Joseph out of Egypt
[16:10] with them now here they are Liv seeing
[16:14] the bones of the man that that God used
[16:17] went in a time of famine to bring and
[16:20] preserve life when he stood there and
[16:22] told his Brethren he said y'all sold me
[16:25] and and treated me bad and all this for
[16:27] evil but God done this p preserve life
[16:30] and here they are and and all the things
[16:32] that God had done for them and all the
[16:34] things that took had taken place in
[16:36] Egypt all this had had happened and here
[16:40] they are to see all the things that they
[16:42] had been through and you know all they
[16:43] could see is the you know all these 400
[16:45] years of bondage and and all of the task
[16:48] Masters and all the Death and All the
[16:50] destruction and all those type things
[16:52] but here God came and told him in a time
[16:54] when he sent Moses to him and he told
[16:56] him he said I'm going to bring you out
[16:59] Now's the Time to come out I I made this
[17:01] promise I made the promise to your
[17:03] father Abraham that you will come out
[17:06] you'll Ser you'll sojourn in a Strange
[17:08] Land but you're coming out because
[17:10] there's a promised land that you're
[17:11] coming into and I'm going to fulfill my
[17:14] word and here they are sitting in the
[17:16] land to see those things and here they
[17:18] are going out and after after they've
[17:21] already seen the the water turned to
[17:23] blood they'd already seen all of the the
[17:26] the fleas the lice the frogs all those
[17:28] different different things that they had
[17:29] seen all the destruction that had taken
[17:32] place all the brimstone all those things
[17:35] all the destruction that they had seen
[17:37] all the see live through the darkness
[17:40] the death of the firstborn all the
[17:42] things that they had seen all the all
[17:44] the things that God had brought them
[17:45] through telling them ahead of time what
[17:47] was going to take place and they come
[17:49] out through that and here they are God
[17:51] set them up there told him listen you're
[17:53] going to come out you got to have you
[17:55] got to be prepared you got to eat the
[17:57] the lamb eat the UN liveing bread get
[18:00] prepared because you know what you're
[18:01] going
[18:02] out and here they are God brought them
[18:04] out and they were ready for
[18:07] battle God had set them in order because
[18:09] Now's the Time because when you go into
[18:11] this land this land of promise you're
[18:13] going to have to
[18:14] fight but you know what he had let them
[18:16] all he had showed them all these great
[18:18] things that was going to take place here
[18:20] they here they are they're they're going
[18:22] to have all these testimonies in front
[18:24] of
[18:25] them but God
[18:27] knew after they had all seen all of that
[18:31] now we can't take the short way we got
[18:32] to go take the long way
[18:35] around
[18:36] because if they see War if if if the
[18:39] Philistines look like they're going to
[18:41] raise up you know what they're not going
[18:42] to be in they're going to be
[18:44] disheartened because of what's going to
[18:46] take place and not and not be encouraged
[18:48] by all the things that they had seen all
[18:51] the things that that God had done to
[18:52] them and seen brought them through up to
[18:54] this point they're not going to see that
[18:56] as an encouragement they're not going to
[18:57] see the power of God in their life
[18:59] they're not going to see what God can do
[19:01] for them here they are they're going to
[19:03] they're going to go through all of this
[19:05] and you know here they are standing
[19:07] there and you're you're going out
[19:08] through this and and here's the here's
[19:10] the pillar of cloud leading them during
[19:13] the day a pillar of fire at
[19:17] night and it's like you know what
[19:19] there's nobody else in the world that
[19:20] had
[19:22] that nobody was under that nobody else
[19:25] had the Covenant that they
[19:27] did but you know what they did not have
[19:31] have the faith to
[19:33] believe when as as a song with all these
[19:36] Mir all the uh with all these many
[19:39] miracles why don't you think it's
[19:41] possible
[19:43] amen after all the many things that you
[19:46] have seen
[19:50] amen I'm sorry what something about you
[19:52] know why don't you
[19:55] believe when all the things he's done
[19:58] for us
[20:02] yes I mean after all these things that
[20:05] you've seen don't you think it's
[20:08] possible don't you believe that God can
[20:10] do these things and here they are
[20:13] they're they're set in order but the
[20:15] problem is is they don't have faith that
[20:18] God's going to lead them
[20:19] through and here and here we are as as
[20:23] here in in the book of Ephesians here's
[20:25] the Apostle Paul writing to us and
[20:27] telling us to put on this whole armor of
[20:30] God that you may be able to
[20:33] stand just like they were they were
[20:35] armored and prepared and in battle
[20:38] formation coming out and so he he's
[20:41] telling us the same thing to put on this
[20:43] whole armor of God that you may be be
[20:46] able to withstand the attack of the
[20:49] enemy here you are you are prepared for
[20:53] battle but will you be like the children
[20:55] of Israel when they've seen all these
[20:57] things and not be not be prepared and
[20:59] not stand up and not realize what God
[21:01] has done for you or will you just stand
[21:03] there and it's like well I I we can't go
[21:06] this
[21:08] way because here here they are and and
[21:11] in the reading of the scripture here
[21:13] when it talks
[21:14] about in Ephesians it says to put on the
[21:18] whole armor of
[21:20] God that you may be able to withand to
[21:22] be able to stand against the Ws of the
[21:25] devil and in verse 14 it says stand
[21:28] there for having your loins G about with
[21:30] truth and having on the breastplate of
[21:32] righteousness now if you go back and
[21:34] look up to put on or to have on means to
[21:37] have something laid upon you to have
[21:39] something that is that is covering you
[21:42] that that is laid upon you it also means
[21:45] like brother Wade is being said has said
[21:47] the last couple of services I believe is
[21:50] in Luke 24 it says he when Jesus is
[21:54] speaking to the to the disciples he says
[21:56] behold I send you the promise of my
[21:58] father upon you but tear you in the city
[22:01] of Jerusalem until you be endued with
[22:03] power from on high so he was saying the
[22:05] word endued is also to put on or to be
[22:08] have on is the same word to be endued
[22:11] which not just means in the physical we
[22:13] say it's to put on something but in the
[22:15] spiritual it's actually to have
[22:16] something inside of you so you actually
[22:19] have this inside of you it is an
[22:21] indwelling of the spirit so you are in
[22:24] because of the of the birth and you of
[22:27] the placing of you in the the C Body of
[22:29] Christ you have this armor yeah and so
[22:32] you have put on so put these things on
[22:34] and realize listen I've got the helmet
[22:36] of salvation I got this breastplate and
[22:38] I've got the sword of the spirit I've
[22:41] got a shield of Faith so when I have
[22:44] these things in I don't have to back up
[22:48] that's right I'm prepared for battle
[22:51] amen now see when when the children of
[22:53] Israel when when Moses was bringing the
[22:55] children out you know he had them going
[22:57] on the land because they were on their
[22:59] way to the promised land there was a
[23:01] they were on this journey leading them
[23:03] to the place that they had just heard
[23:05] about here they are going to a place
[23:07] that they had just heard about but you
[23:09] know what it was
[23:12] real and it's like well you know it's
[23:15] some you know in the site by and by
[23:17] we'll get there but you know what I
[23:20] believe in the in in moses' mind I
[23:22] believe Moses saw the land by faith when
[23:25] he began to walk I don't believe it was
[23:27] just some idea but I he actually really
[23:29] believed and began to walk in that but
[23:31] there was PE you know people that just
[23:33] had as an idea wasn't a it wasn't
[23:35] something that actually was something
[23:37] that was actually concrete to them it
[23:39] was not something firm to them he's like
[23:42] well we're just holding you know but you
[23:44] know what you have to actually see that
[23:47] see that as and so brother BR says he
[23:50] he's leading us today in the spiritual
[23:52] just like he was leading them in the
[23:53] natural he said in the same Pillar of
[23:55] Fire that led the children of Israel
[23:57] here here he is leading us the same one
[24:01] the same Pillar of Fire leading us on
[24:03] the supernatural light of God moving on
[24:05] leading the church spiritually so the
[24:09] same thing the same situation that they
[24:10] were in back there we are in the same
[24:12] situation today and he's leading us and
[24:15] he's made this promise to us that we are
[24:17] going to the Land There is a land that's
[24:20] been promised to us and you know we have
[24:24] realizing we have entered into if you're
[24:26] an overcomer then you have come through
[24:29] the the Egypt you've come into the land
[24:31] of the Wilderness and overcoming but you
[24:33] know when you receive the baptism of the
[24:35] Holy Ghost you have come into that
[24:37] Promised Land you have come into the
[24:40] land of the Overcomer you are an
[24:42] overcomer but you know what you've got
[24:43] to fight in that land you've got to
[24:45] claim everything that belongs to you
[24:47] there is a place for you to reach and it
[24:49] belongs to you and the only thing that's
[24:51] stopping you is
[24:53] you it's the only thing that's stopping
[24:55] me is
[24:56] me see the Pillar of Fire brother said
[24:59] the same angel of God the logos that
[25:02] went out led the children of Israel
[25:04] through the Wilderness he said it's the
[25:07] same one that would came apart in the
[25:10] day of on the day of Pentecost that
[25:12] split up and went into the
[25:14] Believers that same that had the 120 had
[25:18] the same one amen but instead of him
[25:21] leading over us and leading in front of
[25:24] them the Holy Spirit was actually inside
[25:26] them to lead them here they are being
[25:29] led by that same
[25:31] Spirit see if we have that same spirit
[25:34] that was that came down on the day of
[25:35] Pentecost the same one that let that
[25:37] showed them all those Miracles showed
[25:39] the children of Israel all those
[25:41] Miracles and the same thing in the early
[25:43] church and the the days of the Apostles
[25:45] the Miracles that were done was done by
[25:47] the holy spirit amen leading them
[25:50] through to do those things he said it
[25:52] should put us today he said we ought to
[25:54] be one heart one mind and one Accord
[25:57] because you know what if the same spirit
[25:58] that was back there it should have the
[26:00] same experience it should have the same
[26:02] effect today that it did back
[26:06] then that we should have the same
[26:09] thing see as brother R said we live we
[26:13] live below our
[26:14] privileges
[26:16] am
[26:17] see see we understand that we're all one
[26:20] body we're all one Army we're all
[26:23] equipped to fight together it's our
[26:26] battle you know there's no there no
[26:28] there's no you know uh no man on an
[26:31] island and if and if you think you're if
[26:34] you think you're going to be like Rambo
[26:35] I'm sorry that's not the way it
[26:38] works it's all of us have to work
[26:41] together because we're a body we're a
[26:43] unit you know brother brand talked I
[26:45] believe it uh restoration of the brid
[26:47] tree there brother brand was talking
[26:48] about those men and he said they were
[26:50] going through this training and he said
[26:51] they were he was listening to the radio
[26:53] and they were talking about those men
[26:54] climbing under barbwire live machine gun
[26:57] fire going over their head heads he said
[26:59] they're they're sing there with their
[27:00] pockets full of sand and all of that
[27:02] kind of training that they were going
[27:04] through he said because there's rigid
[27:06] training that they've got to go through
[27:08] he said he said he said we are here
[27:09] tonight go this is rigid training for us
[27:12] he said because the battle's out there
[27:13] but we all have to go through this
[27:15] training because God wants to bring us
[27:17] through because you know now is the time
[27:19] that we get to the place where that you
[27:21] find out what you're made
[27:23] of what you've got and what you don't
[27:25] have see brother Bram says here in the
[27:28] message thirsting for life he said see
[27:30] but in principle he said we ought to
[27:33] stand one Great Mighty Army of God
[27:35] marching on and that's where I got my
[27:37] title from one Mighty Great Mighty Army
[27:40] of God marching on because each one of
[27:42] you in your peculiarity God has proved
[27:45] that he's ignoring your Doctrine because
[27:47] he give you the Holy Ghost and the Bible
[27:50] said he gave them the holy ghost that
[27:53] obeyed him he said now if I obeyed him
[27:57] in my peculiar way and you obeyed him in
[27:59] your peculiar way he give us both the
[28:01] Holy Ghost we ought to be Christian
[28:03] Brethren and sister enough to put to arm
[28:06] up together and March on for one great
[28:09] purpose the gospel so you know I mean
[28:12] everybody is is their own person but you
[28:15] know there's a time you've got to get
[28:17] past your and you know everybody's going
[28:19] to be different everybody's going to
[28:20] have their peculiarities but you know
[28:21] what all of us have to be one in
[28:25] Christ you know when when you when you
[28:27] go into to the military and you know
[28:30] some of the like Brother Don and
[28:31] different ones you know when you go in
[28:33] and the first thing they want you to do
[28:35] is they want to separate your
[28:39] individuality because you know what it's
[28:40] not about you anymore it's about the
[28:43] whole
[28:43] group it's all about everybody
[28:47] together you know because brother
[28:48] brandom said living the Christian Life
[28:50] is living for others it's not about
[28:52] living for ourselves because you know
[28:54] what everything that we say and do ought
[28:56] to be pleasing to the Lord but it ought
[28:58] to be edifying to the body of Christ and
[29:00] we ought to hold our tongues and watch
[29:03] the things that we say to make sure that
[29:04] it's not offensive to
[29:07] anybody and so you know those things
[29:09] because you know I don't want because
[29:10] like brother brandham said you know one
[29:12] one little misdeed one little thing that
[29:14] happens you know we can cause a problem
[29:16] in the church we can cause somebody not
[29:18] to get their healing and those different
[29:19] things as you know we've heard brother
[29:21] brandom say you know all those things
[29:23] you know we can cause an issue to come
[29:25] up just by not watching what we say
[29:28] you know there's many times people say
[29:30] things and they and they you know they
[29:31] they don't mean anything by what they're
[29:33] saying but the problem is is when when
[29:36] you go to speak sometimes the problem is
[29:38] is before they speak they ought to pray
[29:40] and and say Lord you know watch my what
[29:43] help me keep my mouth because the
[29:45] problem is that sometimes they're not
[29:46] paying attention to what they're saying
[29:48] not not they're trying to be offensive
[29:50] not or anything like that but sometimes
[29:52] their brain's not engaged when their
[29:54] mouth
[29:56] is and I'm and I'm guilty you the same
[29:59] thing but I mean you know sometimes but
[30:01] you know you say things and as soon as
[30:03] comes out of your mouth and you realize
[30:04] you know what I shouldn't have said
[30:09] that but see here we are fighting this
[30:12] this greatest battle and you know the
[30:15] the devil's going to try to hinder you
[30:16] in every sit every little way every
[30:18] little problem that you see all these
[30:20] things are going to come up and it's
[30:22] going to have have an effect on you you
[30:24] know it's just like when brother Brandon
[30:25] was uh speaking about the squirrels you
[30:28] know he was telling them about how he
[30:29] was he killed the squirrels and you know
[30:31] he knew that they were going to be here
[30:32] and the Lord spoke to him and he said
[30:34] you know I want one here and there and
[30:35] he come to the one he couldn't find and
[30:37] he was out there trying to find that one
[30:39] squirrel and brother I believe it was
[30:41] brother Donovan was praying he said Lord
[30:42] if brother brandham told the truth let
[30:44] him find that
[30:46] squirrel and brother bram's like they
[30:49] don't believe
[30:50] me do they not believe me he stand there
[30:54] and he you know he almost gets a complex
[30:55] because of what was said well brother
[30:57] Donovan didn't realize what said in the
[30:58] prayer because he was hoping brother
[31:00] Brandon would find the squirrel and then
[31:02] he went back later and he said well I
[31:04] didn't I didn't remember saying that but
[31:07] it was something that was said to see
[31:09] how brother brandham would act react to
[31:11] it and so you know when when things are
[31:14] said but you know you have to realize
[31:15] you know sometimes you just got to have
[31:19] U Love covers a multitude of sins and
[31:23] sometimes you just got to overlook those
[31:25] things and and not realize you know hey
[31:29] your brother says things and you just
[31:31] got to overlook them and pray for them
[31:34] and not take offense to it sometimes
[31:36] although it can be
[31:38] tough but see we're in this great battle
[31:41] brother BR says and the greatest battle
[31:43] ever fought he said the greatest battle
[31:45] ever fought he said she's going on right
[31:48] in here now yes sir between life and
[31:50] death between sickness and health
[31:51] between faith and doubt he said oh my
[31:53] between Liberty and bondage the battle
[31:56] is on Shine Your spe soldiers polish up
[31:59] the armor God is getting his soldiers
[32:01] ready amen God anoints his
[32:07] army see we we got to get into into this
[32:10] into the battle in this Army and brother
[32:12] say he said so in an Army first in
[32:15] getting ready for a battle first there's
[32:17] got to be a select some soldiers they've
[32:21] got to be dressed for fighting they've
[32:22] got to be trained for fighting and he
[32:24] said I believe that the greatest battle
[32:26] that was ever fought is now ready to go
[32:28] into action I believe that God has been
[32:31] selecting his soldiers I believe he's
[32:32] been dressing them training them and
[32:35] said now the Battlefront is now
[32:38] set so now is now is the battle and you
[32:42] know here's here's the battle and we
[32:44] realize that you know some of us have
[32:46] been in the way for a while and some of
[32:49] us may not have been in it that long but
[32:52] you know it's the same
[32:53] battle and you all got to join in and
[32:55] you all got to take your place and and
[32:58] and start in in that
[33:00] battle and you know many times when
[33:02] people say you know well what what is
[33:05] what is this battle about you know and
[33:08] understanding that you know it it's not
[33:10] as much
[33:12] um I always said it's not like it's not
[33:15] like Matt Dylan stepping out into the
[33:17] street and facing the man down or you
[33:20] know Gary Cooper in High Noon you know
[33:23] going out to face him by all alone you
[33:26] know but it's the simple
[33:28] things you know the Bible says the foxes
[33:31] spoil the vine it's the simple things in
[33:34] life that that you see that that that's
[33:37] the
[33:38] battle you know many times in in in
[33:42] battle and
[33:45] um you look back especially I always
[33:48] think about Vietnam and you know the the
[33:50] the men that fought there and you you go
[33:52] through well there was a lot of things
[33:54] that were hidden you know in in Guerilla
[33:55] Warfare there's a lot of things that
[33:56] were hidden they didn't see what was
[33:58] going on lots of times they were
[34:00] surrounded by enemy they didn't see them
[34:03] they had all these traps set up nobody
[34:05] saw
[34:06] them and so they always had to be on
[34:08] guard because here's here's all these
[34:10] things and that's the way the devil is
[34:11] he's sneaky it's not it's not where you
[34:13] know like the Revolutionary War was
[34:16] where you come across the battle or the
[34:18] or the Civil War where you see all of
[34:20] your enemy right out in front of you and
[34:21] they just line up and you know you just
[34:23] start shooting and you start running
[34:25] toward the
[34:26] enemy lots of times it's gorilla Warfare
[34:29] you don't see what's
[34:31] coming and so when when you see this see
[34:34] it's it's it's very
[34:37] sneaky but you always have to be on
[34:39] guard amen right see brother BR says
[34:42] here and in the
[34:44] message he's talking about in his life
[34:46] story you know he was talking about you
[34:49] know he never got to fight in the Army
[34:51] but he said he said he he he found the
[34:53] Army to get into and he said he said but
[34:56] dear Christian friends he said I'd
[34:57] rather in the army of the Lord than any
[34:59] place that I know of that's right cuz I
[35:02] know that some someday we're going to a
[35:04] land where there ceaseless ages we'll
[35:07] live there forever and he said but if
[35:09] I'm not man enough to be out in the Army
[35:12] to fight with the Armed Forces then God
[35:13] give me a job here to fight the powers
[35:15] of the enemy and he said I am a soldier
[35:18] after all one in the ranks with you
[35:19] dressed with your type uniform and your
[35:22] brother in the
[35:24] service amen and so you know when when
[35:26] you don't have these things but he said
[35:28] I'd rather be in this one he said
[35:29] because he didn't get to pick he didn't
[35:31] get to pick to be in in that but that
[35:33] Army but God put him in the army that he
[35:35] wanted him to be in and he prepared him
[35:37] and he said see we're speaking of these
[35:39] armored men going into battle he's got
[35:41] to prepare himself he said no and no
[35:43] Nation would prepare to send a man on
[35:45] the battlefield and trained he might not
[35:47] only get himself killed but another
[35:49] group he doesn't know how to take hold
[35:52] so he must be prepared for it and he
[35:54] said and the nations are wise to that
[35:56] they got to get their men ready ready
[35:57] for battle and so you know that's what
[36:00] God wants us to do is to get ready for
[36:02] this battle and realizing that this
[36:05] battle is for us and you know the and
[36:08] you you look at the one of the first
[36:10] places that I that I think of when when
[36:12] you think of of
[36:14] this you know not not this not this
[36:17] well-trained Army and you know like like
[36:19] we see you know like these Special
[36:21] Forces kind of these men you know all
[36:23] this kind of great technology and all
[36:26] these great weapons and everything but
[36:27] you know it's it's these men that that
[36:30] have this great desire to fight you know
[36:33] it's it's it's not just the the Great
[36:35] Men of these great Heroes but every man
[36:37] that has taken up the oath to fight then
[36:41] they're a hero every man that has taken
[36:44] the oath to defend what he believes in
[36:48] in the natural when a when a man takes
[36:49] the oath a woman takes that oath to
[36:51] stand there and defend the Constitution
[36:53] and protect this country then you know
[36:55] what they're Heroes because they go and
[36:57] wherever they're at and they nobody may
[37:00] never know their name nobody may know
[37:02] what they've done but you know what
[37:03] everything that they do because every
[37:05] por every part is essential amen every
[37:08] part every everything that they do is
[37:11] essential and that's the reason I I give
[37:13] my respect to our Armed Forces because
[37:16] they fight whatever they do and they say
[37:19] well I didn't do this and I didn't do
[37:20] that but you know what you answered the
[37:22] call and whatever it is if if you just
[37:24] had to scrub toilets or if you peeled
[37:26] potatoes or what whatever else you know
[37:28] if you never never flew a a military
[37:31] plane and never never grade any stars on
[37:36] your on your
[37:38] collar it doesn't
[37:41] matter because it's about being
[37:44] answering the call that's right and it's
[37:46] the same way with us it's not any big
[37:48] eyes or little use but it's being
[37:50] faithful to the call that God has called
[37:52] us to amen whatever portion God calls
[37:56] you to that is your job he's not going
[37:59] to ask you if you done this or if you
[38:01] done that did you preach the gospel did
[38:02] you do this were you musician all these
[38:04] things he's going to ask you in the end
[38:06] were you Faithful the answer will be
[38:09] well done my good and faithful servant
[38:11] that is the that is what we're looking
[38:13] for as a child of God are you going to
[38:15] be faithful to the call that God give
[38:18] you and you know the one person I think
[38:21] of in the scripture that that answered
[38:23] that in in that situation where you look
[38:25] at somebody that wasn't well trained we
[38:27] don't we don't see anything in the
[38:29] scripture of this person ever having
[38:31] military training not having anything
[38:34] but you know what God called him to do a
[38:37] job and that was Abraham and God called
[38:40] him and he had a journey and God told
[38:43] him that his hand was upon him and you
[38:45] know what when when he left his father's
[38:48] house and he said separate from all all
[38:50] your Kindred and go into a place that I
[38:53] lead you I'm going to take you to a
[38:54] place and he said and you the Earth is
[38:56] going to be blessed blessed those who
[38:58] bless you will be blessed those who
[38:59] curse you will be cursed and here he is
[39:01] he's leading he's leading Abraham out
[39:04] but you know what he came along and he
[39:06] brought lot with
[39:08] him and like I always said when you when
[39:10] you leave out the the problem is is
[39:12] people bring a lot of stuff when they
[39:14] come with God they bring a lot of things
[39:15] that they shouldn't bring with them they
[39:17] keep because God's trying to separate
[39:19] you from unbelief and all of the baggage
[39:21] and a lot of things but we still want to
[39:22] hold on to a lot of things that we
[39:24] shouldn't hold on to because he's trying
[39:26] to free you from that but Abraham went
[39:28] left with lot well he got to a place
[39:30] that God had to separate and get rid of
[39:32] him because you know and here he was he
[39:34] allowed lot to choose which way he
[39:36] wanted to go and he said I going to go
[39:38] the other
[39:39] way and he allowed him to go and he
[39:41] chose because he was a man and you know
[39:43] that that just by his own eyesight not
[39:45] seeing the the the danger not seeing the
[39:48] sin and all the other problems that lay
[39:50] ahead he didn't see any of that all he
[39:52] saw was the well-watered Plains and how
[39:54] wonderful it
[39:56] looked and you know he went that way but
[39:58] you know when he got in trouble here
[40:00] here's Abraham we don't see him ever
[40:03] being a great Soldier not being a strat
[40:05] just any of those things we don't see
[40:07] but you know what God had called him and
[40:10] he left there with 318 men to go get
[40:15] lot and he took on Five
[40:18] Armies amen he took on Five Armies and
[40:21] he
[40:23] one and brother Brenham types that with
[40:26] Christ and he also types that with
[40:29] us he types he types that that spirit is
[40:33] the type of Christ and the spirit of
[40:35] Christ in us to go after our brother if
[40:39] your brother Falls well you know what
[40:41] that was his choice he look at the messy
[40:44] in well you know what you ain't got to
[40:46] go over there and throw dirt on him
[40:49] right because he said he said if you
[40:52] don't have the the love of God in your
[40:54] heart to go after your brother he said
[40:56] you need to be in the
[40:59] if we don't have that if we don't have
[41:00] that desire to go after them no matter
[41:03] and you say well you know look at the
[41:05] great odds that Abraham had you know
[41:07] what Abraham was not looking at the odds
[41:10] he was looking at the
[41:12] promise he was looking at what God had
[41:14] promised
[41:16] him and here he is going and when when
[41:19] he fought this great battle that that
[41:21] had impossible
[41:24] odds he brought back the spool and he
[41:27] brought back
[41:29] lot he got what he what he went for and
[41:32] in the process when he came back he melt
[41:34] mesic in the way and had
[41:37] communion and brother talk about this in
[41:40] the last day when we get done with this
[41:41] great battle we're in this great battle
[41:43] right now then you know what we're going
[41:45] to meet the king and we have communion
[41:47] amen we're going to have we're going to
[41:49] have this overcoming rejoicing
[41:53] time see we have to have that same
[41:55] Spirit of Christ yeah go after our
[41:58] brother amen see fight and he said you
[42:02] know you got to no matter where he's
[42:04] going or how bad it gets you know you
[42:06] don't give up on
[42:08] him brother BR was talking about you
[42:11] know he said they I believe he said he
[42:12] pursued him all the way to
[42:14] Dan you know they just kept going and
[42:16] going and going he like we we're going
[42:18] to win this battle no matter how far we
[42:20] got to
[42:21] go we're not giving
[42:24] up it's like well you what I've got
[42:26] wward L ones well we're not giving up we

[42:33] in the in your family and and problems

[42:37] but we're not giving up we're going to
[42:39] pursue this thing we're going to pursue
[42:42] it all the way to the end it's like well
[42:44] I've been in this battle for 20 years
[42:46] well I'm going keep fighting I'm not
[42:47] giving up why because you never know
[42:49] when the battle is going to be that the
[42:51] last battle is going to
[42:55] be you know sometimes people get right
[42:57] to the end and not realize Now's the
[42:59] Time to Victory to have the final
[43:01] Victory to overcome this and then give
[43:04] up when you get so close and then you
[43:06] say well I've reached the end I just
[43:08] don't I just don't no you don't see the
[43:11] end but I see
[43:14] Jesus he's leading me to continue to
[43:18] fight yes sir all the
[43:21] way because you say I I'm I'm going
[43:25] because this what God promised me
[43:28] where do I have to go all the
[43:31] way where it looks good bad or
[43:33] indifferent I'm still fighting I'm not
[43:35] giving up I'm still
[43:39] pursuing see we got to keep fighting and
[43:41] and hold on and and you see when you in
[43:45] this battle everybody everybody's in in
[43:47] their battles that you're fighting just
[43:49] like he was he was there and he had
[43:50] those 38 318 men with him that was
[43:53] fighting but you know Abraham never gave
[43:55] up he kept fighting he had he had that
[43:57] one thing that he was going to do and he
[43:58] was going to overcome
[44:00] amen and in the scripture in in Hebrews
[44:04] 10
[44:06] 10:23 it says let us hold fast the
[44:09] profession of our faith without wavering
[44:11] for he is faithful that promise he said
[44:13] let us consider one another to provoke
[44:15] unto love and to Good Works see we're
[44:18] all we're all in a battle and brother
[44:21] brand said to provoke means to encourage
[44:24] encourage one another un love and good
[44:26] works he said if you see a brother in
[44:28] the church that's got something against
[44:29] another brother don't say something to
[44:31] stir that thing up but say something
[44:34] that'll bring them
[44:36] together see when you see the battle
[44:39] going on then the thing is is you've got
[44:41] to get into the place where you can get
[44:43] into battle and be an
[44:45] encouragement right you've got you've
[44:48] got to find the place and and lots of
[44:49] times like well I don't know what to do
[44:51] well the one thing you got to do is pray
[44:53] amen you need to pray
[44:57] like when I was preaching at I was
[44:58] preaching at brother Luke's and I told
[45:00] him I said lots of times the problem
[45:02] with with churches is when when things
[45:05] come up and people ask you know why why
[45:06] is this going on and why is that going
[45:08] on and like why don't the preacher the
[45:10] pastor do this and the pastor do that
[45:12] lots of times you don't know what the
[45:14] pastor knows and you don't know what he
[45:17] knows and you don't know what God's told
[45:19] him and lots of times like I said it's
[45:22] above your pay grade God ain't talking
[45:23] to you he's talking to the pastor but
[45:25] the problem is and instead of people
[45:27] questioning what was going on ask them
[45:29] how many times have you got down on your
[45:30] knees and you prayed about the situation
[45:32] before you start questioning it that's
[45:35] right that's your
[45:37] job we've got we've got word from the
[45:40] prophet to tell us to pray for the
[45:43] pastor well if you want the church to
[45:45] grow how many times have you prayed for
[45:46] the
[45:50] pastor how how many times have you
[45:52] prayed for the five-fold
[45:54] ministry amen and then people wonder why
[45:57] things don't happen well you know what
[45:58] God didn't ask you to because if he
[46:00] wants to give you the answer he'll give
[46:01] you the answer but you know what lots of
[46:02] times we're not in the position to get
[46:04] the
[46:06] answer the pastor gets the
[46:09] answer and you know what I I've got I've
[46:11] got all the confidence in the world that
[46:13] God speaks to brother wait and he's
[46:14] going to do whatever God tells him to do
[46:16] and you know what he's my pastor and you
[46:18] know what I give him respects and honor
[46:20] and you know what and then I'm going to
[46:21] say I'm right behind you until the Lord
[46:24] tells me something different then you
[46:25] know what I'm going to be right there
[46:26] there and I'm going to say that's that's
[46:28] because you know what if God don't tell
[46:29] me nothing then you know what my job is
[46:31] to trust that man because I believe I'm
[46:34] following him as he's following Christ
[46:37] but I believe I got the Holy Spirit if
[46:38] he gets off then you know he can speak
[46:40] to me to tell me about
[46:44] it but if we get in if we get in our
[46:47] place then you know what it progresses
[46:49] the body of Christ advances but the
[46:51] problem is is if we get out if we get to
[46:53] on Shaky Ground then you know what
[46:55] nothing happens
[46:59] right see that's how you become an
[47:01] encouragement to somebody say listen I
[47:03] appreciate you I'm I'm encouraging I
[47:05] want you to keep
[47:07] going amen see don't don't give
[47:11] up see he said if you you
[47:15] know he said if you don't feel like
[47:17] bringing them together it's time that
[47:19] you got in the altar that's right
[47:22] there's something happened in your life
[47:23] there is something you've been deceived
[47:25] in you haven't got the experience that
[47:27] God wants you to
[47:29] have so you've got to come to this place
[47:32] and realize this is the spirit of Christ
[47:34] and the spirit of Christ is going to
[47:35] bring us in unity
[47:38] amen that's that's because you know what
[47:40] you're going to separate from unbelief
[47:42] and we're all going to come
[47:45] together the spirit of God brings us
[47:47] together as one am because you can't say
[47:51] well I I you know I don't I don't need
[47:54] you I don't I don't need you I don't
[47:56] need you I and
[47:57] no every every person is
[48:00] important if you're if you're a son or a
[48:03] daughter of God everybody's important
[48:05] everybody has a part to play and lots of
[48:07] times like well I I don't know what I'm
[48:09] supposed to do read your Bible and
[48:12] pray be a
[48:15] light you know one of the greatest
[48:17] testimonies a person can have is a
[48:19] person that's not blown around with all
[48:21] winds of Doctrine and have ups and downs
[48:24] and have all kinds of problems but you
[48:25] know what somebody that that can battle
[48:28] the storms can weather the storms and
[48:30] you know they they don't have they don't
[48:31] have to be a preacher they don't have to
[48:33] be an evangelist they don't have to be a
[48:35] song leader they don't have to be a
[48:36] deacon but you know there's somebody
[48:38] that can come and you see you see people
[48:40] and they're ups and they're downs and
[48:42] you know what they still press on and
[48:44] it's like Wonder I mean that's the one
[48:46] thing I I love about my grandmother you
[48:49] know that Grandma gray you know you look
[48:51] back all the things losing her husband
[48:54] when she was little trying to you know
[48:55] she was like early 40s losing her
[48:57] husband trying to raise kids all those
[49:01] things you know all the battles that she
[49:03] went through but you know what she
[49:06] wasn't blown around when when churches
[49:08] split and people come up with crazy
[49:10] doctrines and everything like that you
[49:11] know what she just kept
[49:14] going why because she was anchored into
[49:16] something that you know what all the
[49:18] things that she had to go through now I
[49:20] know she had problems and and things but
[49:22] you know what you see somebody that's on
[49:24] the Rock they're not moved around
[49:26] they're not blown about you know they're
[49:28] they're not up one down you up one day
[49:30] down the next you know they're solid as
[49:32] a
[49:34] rock and that's the kind that's the kind
[49:36] of testimony that I want amen have that
[49:40] kind and it's like you know you don't
[49:42] you don't have to be where people know
[49:43] your name nobody knows you've never been
[49:45] around the world
[49:47] you but you're the people that God puts
[49:50] in your path amen right those are the
[49:52] people that you've got to be the light
[49:54] to that you've got to be an
[49:55] encouragement to
[49:57] and say that's that's a Life of Christ
[50:00] right
[50:02] there he said see live the life and let
[50:05] Christ live in you that makes people
[50:07] hunger and thirst to be like you he said
[50:10] you become
[50:12] salty you become salty he'll get thirsty
[50:16] and the only way that you can be salty
[50:17] is Let The Life of Christ be in you for
[50:20] he is that he said salt only saves as it
[50:25] contacts so we have to be in contact
[50:27] with these and see what God wants us to
[50:29] do and realize this is what God has
[50:31] called us to do
[50:34] amen when you see people go through so
[50:37] many storms and problems in their life
[50:39] and you know what they still just keep
[50:40] on going
[50:42] amen and that's a that's a real
[50:44] testimony
[50:46] amen you know so I'm I'm not going keep
[50:51] you long tonight but I I just got a
[50:53] couple more things I want to look at
[50:54] tonight and and and this is the other
[50:56] thing that I when you when you look at
[50:58] an army and you and you and you look at
[51:00] this great battle that we're in we're
[51:02] all having to fight
[51:04] together brother brand this is this is
[51:06] from Christ the mystery and I want to
[51:07] read this I I love this and I know we've
[51:09] all read it many times and some of us
[51:11] can probably quote it but I still want
[51:12] to read it tonight I just love it
[51:14] because brother BR says love one another
[51:18] he says above everything love one
[51:20] another he said don't no matter what the
[51:22] devil tries to say he said now you're
[51:25] all one great big sweet group now but
[51:28] remember my warning see Satan won't let
[51:30] that stay that way he said no sir he'll
[51:33] shoot everything if he has to bring
[51:35] somebody in to make his Target he'll
[51:38] bring some critic or unbeliever in and
[51:40] sit him down and cause him to fellowship
[51:42] with you under the quietness and things
[51:44] and then he'll shoot that guy with some
[51:46] kind of poison stuff and he'll start
[51:48] through the church with it he said but
[51:51] don't take sides with it don't you have
[51:53] nothing to do with
[51:55] it with anything
[51:57] else he said you stay right loving and
[52:00] sweet and be kind to one another pray
[52:02] for that man and he'll be saved or that
[52:04] woman whoever it is and just pray for
[52:06] them and stick one with another and he
[52:09] says and pray pray with your pastor see
[52:12] he's the shepherd and you give him
[52:14] respects and he'll lead you through
[52:16] because he's ordained of God to do
[52:18] so he said he said the enemy will come
[52:21] and when he does just cling that much
[52:23] closer together and that one that the
[52:26] the devil is using for an enemy will
[52:28] either get out or come in and be one of
[52:30] you that's right and he says don't ever
[52:32] Clan among yourselves or talk or make
[52:34] yourself clannish we are one he said I
[52:37] couldn't say left hand I'm mad at you
[52:40] I'm going to take you away because
[52:42] you're not my right hand he's my left
[52:44] hand I want him to stay right there even
[52:46] the little tip of my finger I want to
[52:49] stay right there every little part of my
[52:51] body stay right there and God wants us
[52:53] as a body of Believers to stay right
[52:55] exactly with one another right with one
[52:59] another and he said you've got tapes on
[53:01] that we've got tapes on what we believe
[53:03] he said we got tapes on discipline in
[53:04] the church and how to behave and he said
[53:07] we got to come here together how we come
[53:11] we got to come here together and sit in
[53:13] Heavenly places he said don't stay home
[53:16] he said if God is in your heart you
[53:17] can't hardly wait for them doors to open
[53:19] out yonder to get in here to fellowship
[53:21] with your brothers he said if you don't
[53:22] feel you don't feel that way I tell you
[53:24] it's time you got to pray it
[53:26] he said cuz we're in the last days and
[53:29] he said we got to assemble ourselves
[53:32] together have Christian love just
[53:34] skipping some of this trying not to read
[53:36] all of it he says if a brother you think
[53:38] is a little wrong or a sister say Lord
[53:40] don't let me never have a root of
[53:42] bitterness spring up because it'll
[53:44] affect him it'll take the Christ right
[53:46] out of my life that poison acids of
[53:49] malice and jealousy and hatred that will
[53:51] just take the Holy Spirit right away
[53:53] from you hurt your pastor it'll do
[53:55] everything see don't do that he said
[53:59] just wax that much closer together he
[54:01] said draw up take the Buckle as the
[54:03] brother testified a minister here the
[54:05] other night about having a buckle see
[54:07] seeing it in a vision just the buckles
[54:10] on the whole armor of
[54:12] God the buckles on the whole arm of God
[54:15] said just pull her on tighten up move
[54:18] right up close to one another love one
[54:20] another anyhow talk nice about one
[54:22] another say nice things about one
[54:24] another he said then God Will Bless
[54:29] you that's what God wants to do I I love
[54:32] that sometimes sometimes I read that and
[54:35] I get hard to keep from crying
[54:39] sometimes because if you don't see that
[54:41] I I want people to see that I want I
[54:43] want that to be exuded from my life that
[54:45] people can see that amen I I know I talk
[54:49] to people at work and sometimes and
[54:50] people say you know I just I just love
[54:52] talking to you because you're always
[54:55] positive I I I know people some come up
[54:57] to you and talk to you and it's say I
[54:59] love you because you know what you're an
[55:01] encouragement well you know what there's
[55:03] there's so much negative in the
[55:06] world and then you can be a positive
[55:09] influence on somebody you can be the
[55:10] encouragement you can provoke them to
[55:12] good
[55:14] works that's what God wants us to
[55:17] do you know brother R was talking about
[55:20] you know AA Allen and you know and the
[55:22] things that AA Allen you know the things
[55:24] that he believed in different things and
[55:26] you know and people tried to put him
[55:28] down and he's like you know AA Allen may
[55:30] not be right but he said I I want to
[55:31] support him I want to help him he's
[55:32] trying to win souls to Christ he said I
[55:35] want to be right beside him he said at
[55:36] the Judgment bar he said I want to stand
[55:38] there next to him and so and my uh place
[55:42] would be beside him showing he's trying
[55:44] to win souls for Christ and that's where
[55:46] I want to
[55:48] be because there was there's nothing to
[55:50] be gained by trying to tear him
[55:53] down I mean he might have talked to
[55:55] brother Allan when was off by himself
[55:57] and told Brother Allan I don't agree
[55:58] with what you believe but you know what
[55:59] he wasn't trying to get in the pull pit
[56:01] to run him
[56:02] down and trying to and trying to hinder
[56:04] what he could do for the for the cause
[56:07] of
[56:10] Christ you know it's just like you know
[56:12] there's so many that you know where they
[56:14] like well I don't I don't agree with you
[56:16] on this and I don't agree with you on
[56:18] that he's like well you know brother BR
[56:19] said you can draw me out I'll just draw
[56:21] my circle
[56:22] bigger I got a Bigg old Circle
[56:26] I can just keep drawing as much as I
[56:28] want
[56:30] to like people say sometimes I want you
[56:33] to know I love you and there ain't
[56:36] nothing you can do about
[56:40] it why because that's my
[56:45] choice he said he said you know if they
[56:47] smack you on one Jesus said if they
[56:49] smack you on one side just let them
[56:50] smack the other side if they want you
[56:53] coat give them your cloak too
[56:57] you know it's just like in the in the in
[56:59] the in the in the seals you know when
[57:01] when the when the red horse rider went
[57:03] out with the sword to take peace from
[57:04] the earth and you know and it was it was
[57:06] so amazing that the that the the combat
[57:09] Beast was the ox and you know that's a
[57:12] sacrificial animal and you know one
[57:15] thing it said he came to take peace from
[57:17] the Earth but you know what he couldn't
[57:19] take their
[57:20] lives you know what always amazed me
[57:23] they they trying to take something from
[57:25] them but they gladly walked into that
[57:27] because they were anointed to do
[57:30] that because that was their testimony
[57:32] because they knew I've got a moment of
[57:35] time that I'm going to have to suffer
[57:37] but you know I'm getting ready to enter
[57:38] in to the glories of the
[57:41] Lord and here they are was like well
[57:43] I've got to suffer for a little bit but
[57:44] you know what they were they could see
[57:46] beyond this veil of that they were going
[57:48] to have to go through the next thing you
[57:49] know they're walking into something
[57:50] that's marvelous that other people
[57:52] couldn't
[57:54] see and so you can't take away something
[57:57] because if something because if you're
[57:59] giving it they can't take it away from
[58:03] you see that's the way it is it's
[58:06] because God is is so freely giving and
[58:09] and that's that should be us
[58:12] also see just take these things and and
[58:15] see what God has given
[58:18] us here here God is calling us to do
[58:21] these
[58:23] things and you know uh
[58:27] we we see our lives sometimes and and I
[58:29] I want to I want to finish here in a
[58:30] minute but you know I think about that
[58:32] that sister there and and I I believe it
[58:35] was in uh Mississippi you know that she
[58:37] goes and uh sees the the lady holding
[58:40] the baby and and and you know brother
[58:42] Brown brother Brown tells the story that
[58:44] you know the Lord tells this woman said
[58:46] you need to go pray for that
[58:47] baby and she sees the lady's got a
[58:50] prayer card and brother Brandon's going
[58:51] to pray for that baby but you know God
[58:53] told her to pray for that baby
[58:57] and and you know she couldn't get away
[58:58] she wanted to try to work some deal or
[59:00] whatever but you know the Lord never let
[59:02] her leave that that burden stayed with
[59:04] her said you got to go pray for that
[59:05] baby amen I said that's that's what you
[59:08] got to do and you know she was so burden
[59:11] she finally went and asked that sister
[59:12] said you know c c can I pray for your
[59:14] baby said the Lord's just not going just
[59:16] not going to let me rest until I and
[59:18] said sure sister you
[59:20] pray and she prayed over that
[59:23] baby and then you know she's like well
[59:27] she saw that lady get in you know she
[59:28] went sit in the balcony said here she is
[59:30] she sees brother brother Brandon come to
[59:32] the platform get ready for service the
[59:33] lady gets in the prayer line say oh
[59:35] wonderful this brother bram's going to
[59:36] pray for the for the
[59:38] child not realizing that's right that
[59:41] when brother brandham comes under the
[59:42] anointing and he begins to discern that
[59:44] it's like Oh Sister your baby's already
[59:47] healed and the sister that's sitting up
[59:50] there in the balcony earlier prayed for
[59:52] your baby and that's when God healed
[59:54] amen she's been healed all this time
[59:56] am because she obeyed the spirit of God
[1:00:00] because she obeyed what God told her to
[1:00:03] do and many times you know some of the
[1:00:05] worst times that I've ever had in my
[1:00:07] life is not and and sometimes it's
[1:00:09] simple
[1:00:11] things and but you you you it's like
[1:00:15] follow the leading of the
[1:00:17] Lord he said whatever you do brother R
[1:00:20] said whatever you do if the Lord leads
[1:00:22] you to do something then that's what you
[1:00:24] have to do
[1:00:28] he
[1:00:29] says he said the compassion of that
[1:00:32] mother for that baby went far went far
[1:00:34] beyond what I had done for it I've had
[1:00:37] done for it see so the gift of healing
[1:00:40] if God ever speaks to your heart to go
[1:00:42] pray for somebody you do what God tells
[1:00:45] you to do see always follow the Holy
[1:00:50] Spirit and you
[1:00:52] know I I I've told this story before but
[1:00:56] I I still brother Harold hilderbrand
[1:00:58] came years ago and came preached he
[1:01:02] preached the whole week in Ruth North
[1:01:05] Carolina and I think brother Dan was
[1:01:07] alive back then he came and preached
[1:01:10] that Sunday morning and preached to
[1:01:11] services that son and his voice was
[1:01:14] shocked he was so he was so and when he
[1:01:18] got done he come sit on the front row
[1:01:20] beside me right there and the Holy
[1:01:22] Spirit was all over me that morning I
[1:01:24] sat right there and the Lord kept
[1:01:26] telling me to lay my hands on
[1:01:29] him and I never
[1:01:32] did and I was like well you know I you
[1:01:34] know I just didn't want to be I was like
[1:01:37] you know it's like well this is brother
[1:01:38] hildbrand and you know it's like you
[1:01:39] know you you don't want to get out of
[1:01:41] out of your place or anything like that
[1:01:42] but you know the second service brother
[1:01:44] hbr come out and his his voice was even
[1:01:47] worse and I I I just could have fell in
[1:01:50] the
[1:01:52] floor and it's was like you know
[1:01:54] what because I look at myself so low
[1:01:57] it's like why would you tell me to do
[1:01:59] that why didn't you get brother dad why
[1:02:00] didn't you get brother w why you get
[1:02:01] somebody
[1:02:02] else because he wanted to know if I'd do
[1:02:06] that just like this young this sister go
[1:02:09] pray for that
[1:02:11] baby God told her to do it it wasn't
[1:02:13] brother brandom's job it was her job to
[1:02:15] do
[1:02:16] it he come up here and I was like you
[1:02:18] know what I felt so bad that that I
[1:02:20] didn't do what God wanted me to
[1:02:23] do but you know I made a I made a
[1:02:25] promise promise that day if God tells me
[1:02:28] to do something I'm going to do
[1:02:31] it and people ask me why you do certain
[1:02:35] things you know because he said check it
[1:02:37] by the word if it's not if it's not
[1:02:40] wrong then do
[1:02:42] it because you know what you may be the
[1:02:46] one that God wants to use to bless
[1:02:50] somebody and so well you know uh you
[1:02:53] know no we we want to we want want to
[1:02:56] try to make ourselves so
[1:02:59] humble but you know what not following
[1:03:01] God's word doesn't make you
[1:03:04] humble I looked at myself so little but
[1:03:07] the problem was if I was humble enough
[1:03:09] then I should have followed What God
[1:03:11] wanted me to
[1:03:12] do that's
[1:03:14] humility to do what God wants you to
[1:03:18] do it's no big eyes or little yous but
[1:03:21] it's all of us working
[1:03:23] together see if you will believe what
[1:03:26] God tells us to do then you'll just do
[1:03:28] it and trust God
[1:03:34] see and I want I want to finish on I
[1:03:36] love this this probably one of my
[1:03:38] favorite quotes I I there's many quotes
