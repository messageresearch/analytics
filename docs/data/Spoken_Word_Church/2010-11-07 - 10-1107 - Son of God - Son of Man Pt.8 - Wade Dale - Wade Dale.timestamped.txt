[0:05] Revelations 3 14.
[0:10] background what we're doing is uh
[0:12] uh we are
[0:14] showing the Son of God to the son of man
[0:16] we've been on it for quite a while
[0:19] how this person that was so great that
[0:22] nobody could comprehend is now become a
[0:25] man that where we could comprehend and
[0:27] feel and touch him
[0:29] the only begotten of the father full of
[0:31] grace and truth we went to Isaiah 53 and
[0:35] showed what this man's purpose was his
[0:37] body was the sacrifice
[0:40] just like a lamb was in the Old
[0:41] Testament but his soul was the very soul
[0:44] of God so that Soul could come back on
[0:46] the believer
[0:47] the animal blood could not come back I
[0:49] want a believer that way or this one
[0:52] this one
[0:55] there you go
[0:58] it really doesn't matter
[1:00] okay
[1:14] that's good Revelation 3 14 is where
[1:16] we're at
[1:17] this man this person this God that came
[1:21] down on Earth and died
[1:24] um to release his life
[1:26] um there was many lives released in the
[1:28] Old Testament as far as animals and but
[1:31] that animal blood could do you no good
[1:33] because it didn't come back into the
[1:34] animal resurrect the animal and say like
[1:38] Jesus said all power and Heaven Earth
[1:39] been given unto me there was one man who
[1:41] did that that's not a man he resurrected
[1:43] on Easter morning right the Son of God
[1:46] come back picked up that body and then
[1:48] he was then
[1:50] complete almighty God you say oh wait
[1:53] and he was well there was things he
[1:55] didn't know remember his dad's been
[1:57] preaching that he didn't know when he
[1:58] was returning there was he limited
[2:01] himself by the brain matter that he came
[2:03] into the human right the humanity that
[2:05] he came into he limited himself to where
[2:09] he didn't know all things right but now
[2:11] when he come out of that grave he said
[2:13] all power in Heaven and Earth has been
[2:15] given unto me he didn't need somebody to
[2:18] teach him anything he didn't need
[2:19] somebody to tell him anything he was
[2:21] done finished the body was now made
[2:25] Eternal that Eternal Body will be our
[2:30] Eternal sacrifice we'll always see the
[2:32] nail scars what do you mean the all in
[2:34] all then it'll be the all in all the
[2:36] only problem is that he wasn't the all
[2:37] in all right then because we were still
[2:39] inside of him right that's what we're
[2:41] getting to now all right don't get ahead
[2:43] of me
[2:45] don't start preaching
[2:47] I was asking but yeah I know that's true
[2:51] but when he resurrected he couldn't say
[2:53] all in all he said all power in Heaven
[2:56] and Earth has been given unto me we were
[2:58] still inside of that man
[3:00] and and had to be released and so we
[3:04] ascended up to heaven correct
[3:07] then what did he do the prophet said 11
[3:10] days later or ten days later 11 days
[3:12] later he sent back what he sent back his
[3:15] Spirit the Holy Spirit right to come
[3:17] into the hearts of the Believers and now
[3:19] here we are at Revelation 3 14 and to
[3:21] the angel of Churchill in the sins right
[3:22] these things said the amen the faithful
[3:25] and true witness the beginning of the
[3:27] creation of God
[3:29] now God is not a creation
[3:32] he's a Creator right
[3:35] but brother Branham said only in Christ
[3:37] is God a creation
[3:39] and if you'll remember as we've been
[3:41] speaking before for some that haven't
[3:43] been here a lot
[3:46] all this is not done for God to develop
[3:50] something different
[3:51] all this is not done for God to say well
[3:54] now I'm no he always was
[3:56] all this that God done was to make his
[4:00] children be able to understand him so
[4:03] every step that he takes is for us to
[4:05] understand him not for him to say well
[4:07] now I'm a son now I'm a father right no
[4:10] he was the all-in-all before the
[4:12] foundation the world because we were
[4:13] back there with him shouting for joy and
[4:15] all those things but we were inside of
[4:16] him in that eternal life we were not in
[4:18] bodies running around like little people
[4:20] all right but he had attributes he
[4:24] wanted us out of him started with Adam
[4:27] started with Eve and then when he done
[4:28] what she done that closed the womb up
[4:30] and he we couldn't be born that way so
[4:33] we had to be born through mom and dad
[4:35] two have our tests and trials on Earth
[4:37] here but he didn't leave us there
[4:40] remembers Genesis uh 3 15.
[4:45] he explains what he's going to do
[4:47] in other words you can't do it now I'm
[4:50] gonna do it
[4:51] that's what he's done it's it's I'm
[4:53] gonna come down and show you that I am
[4:56] all these great things
[4:58] you're the one that's going to have to
[4:59] understand me but I want you to
[5:02] understand me it's not an arrogance to
[5:03] where he said well bless God you got to
[5:05] know right God said you got to
[5:06] understand me because you're my children
[5:08] right right
[5:10] now when we come to John 1 in the
[5:12] beginning was the word words with God
[5:13] and Word was God
[5:15] that was your word body
[5:17] waiting to be made manifest but because
[5:20] we all had to come by sex by Mom and Dad
[5:22] we had to come this one to this one this
[5:24] one this one this one this one this one
[5:25] this one to get you down here because
[5:28] that's what God saw he saw before the
[5:30] foundation the world that you would
[5:31] accept it so he made a way for you to
[5:33] even get here because remember Adam and
[5:35] Eve when they did what they did that cut
[5:37] off the way right for you to get here
[5:40] brother Brown said even Jesus's body
[5:42] should have come through Eve
[5:44] yeah so everything all every Son of God
[5:47] every daughter of God was going to come
[5:48] right through Adam and Eve but when her
[5:50] wound was closed up and polluted God
[5:52] said that ain't gonna happen anymore
[5:53] right in other words you can't keep
[5:55] yourself
[5:56] just plain language we can't keep
[5:59] ourselves all right
[6:02] let's just be plain Adam and Eve was
[6:04] pure
[6:05] all right more pure than we are
[6:08] all right they had a they they didn't
[6:09] have a carnal mind right but Eve just
[6:12] one word she just let down a little bit
[6:14] and see then the ball got rolling and
[6:16] now here we are with a carnal mind that
[6:17] we have
[6:19] but we must have the mind of Christ
[6:21] that's a requirement
[6:22] and the mind of Christ is that creator
[6:25] that was all back before the foundation
[6:26] of the world and that's what I told you
[6:28] last Sunday for us to be able to
[6:30] understand God he had to bring away for
[6:33] you and I
[6:34] to some way get into our mental faculty
[6:39] because he said we must have the mind of
[6:41] Christ
[6:45] um if we were all to come through Adam
[6:47] or through Eve do you mean that
[6:49] literally or as any type of male and a
[6:53] female child that was in the family of
[6:57] God
[6:57] would they have children no I think we'd
[7:00] all come through Adam and Eve we would
[7:02] have all been born through Adam and Eve
[7:03] I don't believe you there would be no
[7:05] see then you'd have a natural lineage we
[7:07] have one lineage and that's Jesus Christ
[7:09] right right we weren't born again for my
[7:11] mom and daddy we were born again for one
[7:13] person
[7:17] Adam would have spoke he would have
[7:20] produced right it wouldn't have been
[7:22] Adam and Eve spoken produced two other
[7:25] people and they would have brought some
[7:26] no no way absolutely not no
[7:29] that would make grandchildren
[7:31] God's not a grain not a granddaddy
[7:34] yeah but if Adam wants to speak to him
[7:36] she had a man and female and they spoke
[7:38] and had a child that's a grandkid right
[7:40] sorry Sons and Daughters Adam and Eve
[7:43] would have had all of us
[7:45] of course it's a moot point one we've
[7:47] been talking about because it didn't
[7:48] happen all right and it ain't gonna
[7:50] happen what's going to happen now
[7:54] sure both everybody but to prove a point
[7:57] is we're not doing that now God's not
[8:00] speaking to speaking to Jesus that's
[8:02] speaking to the Holy Ghost is speaking
[8:04] us into existence that's exactly what
[8:06] you're talking about that's you can't do
[8:07] that that's not three people you got
[8:09] three people in the godhead then all
[8:11] right but no it's one person we come
[8:13] from one man
[8:14] Jesus Christ one man that's right and
[8:17] the Bible says that your mother is the
[8:19] Bible the word
[8:21] and that's where we all came from that's
[8:23] one that we're all kin folks join heirs
[8:25] even when Jesus Christ come he said he
[8:27] was join air that doesn't mean here and
[8:29] here
[8:30] join air means the same I remember
[8:32] brother Harold Hildebrandt preached out
[8:34] a long time ago when I first come back
[8:36] to church and that really struck when he
[8:38] took his fingers and he said God is Not
[8:40] Jesus didn't want us to be like this he
[8:43] wanted us to be join Ayres means you
[8:44] join together and you're the same Heir
[8:47] as the person that joined with you just
[8:49] like this right here John heirs with
[8:51] Jesus Christ so see that would prove one
[8:53] thing that that Adam and Eve wouldn't
[8:55] had Jesus and Jesus had us
[8:57] that wouldn't be John heirs
[8:59] that'd be lesser right he wanted us to
[9:02] be his brother that's what we read in
[9:03] the scripture the other day he wanted us
[9:05] to call us Brethren he wanted us to be
[9:07] our brother he didn't want to be our our
[9:09] Lord he wanted he sure he's inside this
[9:11] man's our Lord and savior this man's our
[9:13] Lord and savior but he wanted to be a
[9:14] man God always wanted to be a human
[9:16] being
[9:18] how do you know that
[9:23] because remember you got to go back to
[9:25] ABC's God don't change right God does
[9:30] not change his mind his mind was always
[9:34] this right here this is what he had in
[9:36] his mind
[9:37] all right of course now we know this is
[9:39] permissive will down here we'll get into
[9:40] some of that later
[9:42] Ginger's gonna hear it next Sunday so
[9:45] she's she's going to get it for you
[9:46] today
[9:47] oh next Sunday
[9:49] who did it last
[9:51] so when you last
[9:52] yeah you did last okay
[9:55] where's Danny at dang oh you know
[9:57] more than one week
[10:00] you got two I got two weeks to cover
[10:03] thank you for reminding me of that I got
[10:04] two weeks to cover Brother Ray you wanna
[10:06] try one
[10:07] okay
[10:15] okay you got it next Sunday
[10:19] he's got the next
[10:21] I'm doing it this Sunday you're doing it
[10:23] this coming Sunday
[10:25] way come on okay
[10:29] so anyway what was my whole thought of
[10:31] this whole process oh I'm going to be in
[10:34] Oklahoma next weekend that's what it was
[10:36] so Jacob is going to get to hear some on
[10:39] predestination
[10:42] which there is
[10:43] this Bible was predestinated by God
[10:46] stamped sealed and delivered
[10:48] pre-determined means you predetermined
[10:50] something and that's the way it's going
[10:51] to be that's why brother Brown said it
[10:53] was hard to say predestination in a
[10:55] crowd that were that was kind of you
[10:57] know a little bit babies because then in
[11:00] your mind then the first thing you think
[11:01] of you think well I have no choice this
[11:04] is exactly what gun I'm gonna have to do
[11:06] because that's what God song that's not
[11:08] it
[11:10] God being infinite and eternal he saw
[11:13] all this
[11:14] happened
[11:16] but then you got to trigger that
[11:18] predestination you've got to make that
[11:20] predestination happen
[11:22] so you got perfect will of God that all
[11:25] should be saved and you got permissive
[11:26] will of God where there's not everybody
[11:27] going to be saved all right
[11:29] but the perfect will of God knew
[11:32] that he'd only have so many children
[11:34] so if you want to just to be real not be
[11:37] babies but to be real strong Christians
[11:39] yes this thing was stamped and sealed
[11:42] before the foundation of the world and
[11:43] it couldn't happen any other way exactly
[11:47] couldn't happen any other way that's
[11:50] pre-destiny that's Destiny determined
[11:52] before you even get here Jacob have I
[11:55] lost love he's gonna have a hate it now
[11:57] you say well then I don't have a choice
[11:59] that all come about
[12:02] because of the choice he saw you make
[12:04] that's right
[12:07] that's right and that all came about
[12:09] this whole predestinated line of
[12:12] Eternity came into being because of what
[12:16] you he saw you do
[12:19] so who is the
[12:23] come on people
[12:25] God said brother Brown said when God and
[12:28] man meet he says two omnipotence
[12:31] meat
[12:33] ye are Gods the Bible said
[12:37] we're even gods in a lower form even
[12:41] somebody's not even born again
[12:44] has a has a long side of him
[12:49] to rule over something
[12:51] to be look at our look at our society we
[12:55] don't all still live in huts
[12:57] that's right we've developed why man has
[13:01] took something and created
[13:03] even a sinful vow you know like Adolf
[13:06] Hitler he gave us some of the best
[13:08] technology in the world as far as
[13:10] Machinery we still can't touch their
[13:12] Machinery in Germany we just cannot get
[13:14] to their uh we buy a lot of products
[13:16] from them in the poultry industry from
[13:18] Germany because they're so precise and
[13:20] the equipment lasts so long
[13:22] than what we do in America all right but
[13:25] but we're going to get into that a
[13:26] little bit later but let's read this
[13:27] here again because this is the beginning
[13:28] of the creation of God this is when this
[13:30] is when when the the uh
[13:34] upper room we know this is
[13:37] um in the loudest end to the layout of
[13:39] sins
[13:40] but this is showing what he is
[13:44] the beginning of the creation of God
[13:48] this is what God wants
[13:51] to be done
[13:53] in this church age he wants you and I to
[13:56] be a complete Christian down through the
[13:58] other ages they were all Christians they
[14:00] were all knowledgeable in the word of
[14:02] God
[14:04] but somewhere down the line Satan got in
[14:06] and started eroding
[14:08] thrown in father-son Holy Ghost brought
[14:11] in water baptism in the name of father
[14:13] son Holy Ghost brought in three Gods
[14:15] brought in things like that God winked
[14:16] at their ignorance but here we come up
[14:17] to the last Church age and this is a
[14:19] requirement that we believe these things
[14:22] saith the amen the faithful and true
[14:23] witness to begin the creation of God who
[14:25] was the beginning of the creation of God
[14:27] Jesus Christ right he was born right the
[14:30] first time yep
[14:32] and everybody understand that he was
[14:33] born right the first time there's no way
[14:35] he could go to Nicodemus any other way
[14:37] and say Nicodemus you were born wrong if
[14:40] he was not born right the first time all
[14:43] right he was born right the first time
[14:45] so he could go to Nicodemus and say now
[14:47] you got to be born again of course in
[14:48] his right in his carnal mind he said I
[14:51] got to go back in my mother's womb again
[14:53] he said no you got to be born from above
[14:54] not from down here from above so this is
[14:57] where the beginning of the creation of
[14:58] God started not in the lab I'm saying
[15:00] Church age but in the first church age
[15:01] because remember God looked at the alpha
[15:04] and he looked at the Omega so the alpha
[15:06] bride and Omega bride are the same all
[15:08] right because even in your Bible turn
[15:09] back to the first
[15:11] Revelations 2 1 says unto the angel of
[15:16] the Church of Ephesus
[15:18] personal
[15:21] all right now look at the next one
[15:24] what does number two say
[15:26] look at verse 12. all the other ages
[15:29] they end
[15:33] Angela Church in Sardis
[15:35] angel of church in
[15:38] all these other ages but now come back
[15:40] over to verse 14 and to the Angela
[15:42] Church of the laod of sins that's
[15:44] showing that the the beginning the alpha
[15:46] what God wanted to begin with
[15:49] that's what he wanted but it became
[15:51] eroded
[15:53] Catholic Church got involved
[15:55] the apostles
[15:57] they all were killed or died and and
[16:01] then you brought Catholic dogma in and
[16:03] stuff like that see so it was it was his
[16:05] first church age that built the
[16:08] foundation and we kind of got off of
[16:10] that coming up through here but when God
[16:12] comes back here in this final age he
[16:14] says you got to listen to this person
[16:18] this person
[16:19] of Jesus Christ has got to be back in
[16:23] that age now not saying he wasn't any
[16:25] other ages but he's going to be back in
[16:27] his fullness like he was when he stood
[16:29] up and said all power and Heaven Earth
[16:31] been given unto me
[16:33] for us to get out of here people we
[16:35] gotta stand just like Jesus Christ doing
[16:37] that day and said all power in Heaven
[16:39] and Earth has been given unto me I can
[16:40] eat but I can walk through a wall that's
[16:42] right I can converse with you I am a
[16:45] human I look like a human but this body
[16:47] is eternal I'm standing in the first
[16:50] three dimensions Time Life matter
[16:54] but I am Eternal that's what God wanted
[16:57] right that's what he's
[16:59] calling us to do right now
[17:02] he's calling us to stand just like he
[17:05] stood at the resurrection when he said
[17:07] that because let me tell you something
[17:09] he could conquer death you and I have
[17:12] not been able to conquer death until
[17:14] this age right here that's right that's
[17:16] right
[17:17] so there's no way that irenius Martin
[17:20] even Paul could stand and say all power
[17:23] and heaven and Earth's been given unto
[17:24] me right because there was one power of
[17:26] death that nobody's conquered all the
[17:28] way down through the church ages but God
[17:30] required this man right here to come
[17:32] back
[17:33] Jesus Christ to come back through a
[17:36] prophet
[17:38] that's right
[17:39] to tell you and I that we got to get
[17:42] back that's Friday remember he's turning
[17:44] this what
[17:47] if we don't get back to the faith of the
[17:49] father's people then we're not going to
[17:51] take a body change because they didn't
[17:53] even that uh the faith of the fathers
[17:56] they didn't take a body change right
[17:58] right but Jesus went through all those
[18:01] things and said hey you can live just
[18:04] like me right all power
[18:08] see when he said all that meant all all
[18:10] power was given to him brother Adam said
[18:11] if it was two or three persons in the
[18:13] godhead he said all them other gods are
[18:14] powerless now he said because if you
[18:16] believe the Bible when Jesus said all
[18:18] powered and Heaven there's been given
[18:19] unto men if you believe that's the
[18:20] Eternal Word of God
[18:22] he said somebody lost some power
[18:25] but it wasn't he was just manifested in
[18:28] his fullness right there right
[18:30] but he was not complete
[18:34] without me and you right and we were
[18:36] still inside of him in eternal life
[18:39] in an eternal genetics not a not a seed
[18:43] like see here we go thinking about sex
[18:45] where a germ has to meet an egg no God
[18:48] creates spoken word right right that's
[18:52] because see that's the same thing
[18:53] happened with Eve
[18:55] there was there was no
[18:57] let's just be playing there was no sperm
[18:59] released and no egg release God spoke
[19:02] and it created a germ that started life
[19:05] he created the the egg that created the
[19:09] body
[19:10] and when those two met he just they're
[19:12] right there in the womb of Mary same way
[19:15] that he took Melchizedek when he stepped
[19:17] down into this Dimension he just snapped
[19:21] his fingers and blew it you know he just
[19:22] said hey I need a body
[19:24] what do you do some kind of genetic
[19:27] matter came together some kind of DNA
[19:29] makeup came together to make that body
[19:31] of that man melchized because he ate
[19:35] he spoke he but he still was almighty
[19:38] God
[19:38] right but see then that body went away
[19:40] that couldn't be our joint heir
[19:42] that's what was talking about several
[19:44] Sundays ago see Melchizedek couldn't
[19:46] save your soul now what was inside of
[19:48] milk as it could save your soul right
[19:50] right but Melchizedek himself was the
[19:53] priest right right
[19:54] but that priest wasn't your joint Heir
[19:57] that priest was one coming down to say
[20:01] something to Abraham this man right here
[20:03] was our Joyner our brother
[20:05] I'll give my blood for you Melchizedek
[20:08] couldn't give his blood for Abraham
[20:10] Jesus Christ had to give his blood but
[20:12] that what was inside of melchized it was
[20:14] Jesus Christ because Jesus Jesus looked
[20:16] at him he said before Abraham was
[20:19] I am now that I am is the one that came
[20:22] down yeah
[20:23] blew a little dust together and talked
[20:26] to Abraham and that was the same set of
[20:28] eyes that Jesus was looking through but
[20:30] it was the theophany of God not the body
[20:33] of Melchizedek looking at those priests
[20:35] when Jesus was born no there was a body
[20:36] had to come we and we've talked in
[20:38] Isaiah 53 that body had to be a lamb
[20:42] sacrifice right John didn't say behold
[20:45] the soul of God to take away the sin of
[20:46] the world he said behold the lamb
[20:48] oh God right right lamb had to die lamb
[20:52] was was the sacrifice Behold the Lamb of
[20:56] God that takes away the sin of the world
[20:58] John was prophesying that that because
[21:00] what has to happen to a lamb lamb has to
[21:03] die
[21:04] Behold the Lamb of God to taste away the
[21:06] sin of the world that lamb had to die
[21:08] that's why John had to wash him in the
[21:10] River Jordan he had to wash the
[21:11] sacrifice just like the sacrifice in the
[21:13] Old Testament
[21:14] okay
[21:16] but now he was the only begotten but
[21:19] right here he wants if there's a
[21:21] beginning the prophet said of the
[21:22] creation of God there must be a
[21:25] continuation of that creation if he's
[21:27] the beginning of the creation of God
[21:29] there must be others to come because if
[21:32] there's a beginning
[21:34] that's the start of something so on the
[21:36] day of Pentecost
[21:39] this man we called Jesus went to heaven
[21:42] he ascended
[21:43] he ascended to Heaven his body can't
[21:46] come back because brother Brown said his
[21:48] body can't be on this sinful earth right
[21:50] until the Millennium when God wipes this
[21:53] thing or when man actually wipes this
[21:55] thing off and God can come down with us
[21:58] it's a position
[22:00] that you that you come to
[22:02] I believe there's a position that you
[22:04] and I come to just like Jesus when he
[22:07] was standing after the resurrection
[22:08] because if we're going to see we which
[22:10] are alive and remain
[22:13] alive and remain to the coming of the
[22:16] Lord shall not prevent or hinder those
[22:18] who are asleep for they're going to come
[22:20] up first
[22:21] be called out of the ground
[22:24] their body will be changed and then our
[22:26] body will be changed into what the same
[22:29] body Jesus was standing when he said all
[22:30] power and Heaven on Earth been given
[22:31] unto me because that person whoever that
[22:34] is it don't take but one right
[22:37] can say death now has no more dominion
[22:40] over me amen death has nothing to do
[22:43] with this body that my mom and my daddy
[22:46] brought here right what has happened is
[22:48] is what was inside of you has
[22:50] materialized to the outside right
[22:53] it's like a sponge right
[22:57] it's like a sponge you take a sponge and
[23:00] if there's water inside of a sponge you
[23:01] really can't see it on the outside but
[23:02] you take and squeeze it that's right
[23:04] what happens that water just permeates
[23:06] all to the outside of the sponge now you
[23:09] got a wet sponge and that's what's going
[23:10] to happen with that's why we're that
[23:12] we're going to discuss next time on the
[23:14] Bible study this is and I don't like to
[23:17] say just because just means something
[23:19] smaller but the Holy Ghost you received
[23:22] that your new bar is just an Earnest
[23:25] right it's just a down payment
[23:28] it's just a little speck of what you're
[23:31] going to get or what you're going to be
[23:32] but that little speck is like the water
[23:34] in the ocean
[23:36] right you can say I got the whole ocean
[23:38] in the palm of my hand with one drop
[23:41] because you can take that chemical put
[23:43] it under a microscope and take the
[23:44] billions and billions of gallons out in
[23:46] the ocean put them together and they're
[23:48] the same right but you've only got a
[23:50] little speck of it
[23:52] but you can say then you can say well I
[23:55] am born again and I get all the benefits
[23:58] that God give me that's exactly true but
[24:00] you
[24:01] are the ones got to climb that ladder
[24:03] right there that's right God's not going
[24:06] to push you up that ladder the statue of
[24:07] perfect man you got to climb it
[24:09] you got to climb that ladder you got to
[24:11] go up all right so then it is Justin
[24:15] Ernest
[24:16] because like we were talking about last
[24:17] night it's just to earnest money now you
[24:20] can drive the car or you can you know
[24:22] most of us bought houses you most of us
[24:25] put money down well what is that that's
[24:27] your earnest money but that sure ain't
[24:28] if you put a thousand dollars down and
[24:30] you owe a hundred thousand
[24:32] that's the earnest if that ain't the
[24:34] hundred thousand dollars you still got
[24:36] to make the payment every month you
[24:38] still got to come to church read your
[24:39] Bible I want to do the things that you
[24:41] know Christian's supposed to do but if
[24:44] you complete the deal
[24:47] then you can look back on that thousand
[24:49] dollars
[24:50] and say that was worth a hundred
[24:52] thousand dollars
[24:56] you see what I'm saying so you the Holy
[24:58] Ghost once you look back say you'll not
[25:01] ever look back and say well Blau is a
[25:03] babbling baby and that was worthless no
[25:05] you started as a babbling baby
[25:08] and you worked your way up you started
[25:11] with a thousand dollars you made your
[25:13] payments just like the bank you know
[25:14] gives you the the thing that now he
[25:17] holds the title well see the problem
[25:19] with what we have is there's a squatter
[25:22] that holds our title
[25:29] there's an evil Banker
[25:32] you quit preaching for me
[25:34] he's helping you there's an evil Banker
[25:37] that's holding part of the title
[25:40] right
[25:43] I mean brother Branham said said God
[25:46] took back from Adam took back the title
[25:48] deed but he said there's a squatter
[25:51] there's one in between you and God that
[25:53] you got to deal with
[25:54] even with Boaz and Ruth Boaz had to go
[25:57] ask that near Kinsman
[26:00] if he would do the right first
[26:03] he said forget it don't want it
[26:05] so then Boaz well that was the devil
[26:08] that's the guy that's got a hold of this
[26:09] man right here he holds this title
[26:13] now
[26:14] because remember he disputed on the body
[26:16] of Moses in Jude he want to know where
[26:18] God what God did with it why because
[26:19] he's got dibs on it he's got a tag
[26:22] because God told him said dust you shall
[26:24] eat for the rest of your life well
[26:26] that's what is this is Dutch human dust
[26:28] that's what that serpent serpents don't
[26:30] eat dirt
[26:32] right but that serpent that God cursed
[26:36] he is eating dirt he's been eating dirt
[26:38] since Adam started dying since I mean
[26:40] since uh April died right he's been
[26:43] eating this dirt
[26:44] but somewhere some way something was got
[26:48] to happen
[26:50] and it's got to be something in the word
[26:52] that'll show us that that has been done
[26:55] away with amen somewhere we're going to
[26:58] find it I just know we're gonna find it
[27:00] because Paul could look at it
[27:03] through a glass Darkly
[27:05] he could see it but he couldn't get to
[27:07] it because he said you know I don't see
[27:09] all things but I see Jesus all right he
[27:12] knew as a prophet I believe he could see
[27:14] this end time and in here we had a
[27:16] Prophet come in the end time and he told
[27:17] us
[27:18] somewhere in those books and tapes the
[27:20] prophets that lies Rapture and Faith
[27:21] well to make Rapture and Faith you've
[27:24] got to be changed here right
[27:27] so something's laying in all this that
[27:30] we got to pull out
[27:31] and I don't think it's some kind of
[27:33] secret formula that you have to you know
[27:36] look in the Bible and turn it a certain
[27:38] way and pick out certain letters that's
[27:40] to me that's that's like witchcraft
[27:42] stuff right
[27:44] really that's what it is you know people
[27:46] say wow Jesus hits these names in the
[27:48] Bible that's okay that's fine I mean if
[27:49] he did that because brother around said
[27:51] the new the numerics of the Bible are
[27:53] perfect
[27:54] but I don't think we're gonna find some
[27:59] special tape
[28:00] that's right that brother Brown hid
[28:02] somewhere in a cave that somebody's
[28:04] gonna find it we're gonna that's for
[28:06] lazy people
[28:08] hey if we knew that's what he wants what
[28:11] are we doing here I'm tired I've been
[28:12] working since six o'clock this morning
[28:14] so or seven and
[28:17] I just don't go back home go to bed but
[28:19] no you get up and you strive you work
[28:23] and you work and you work and you're
[28:25] working I'm talking about working for
[28:26] God and ain't talking about working for
[28:27] man but you work for God the best you
[28:29] can
[28:31] and somewhere that we may all have to
[28:33] die
[28:34] but so what
[28:36] we I have to believe that that man that
[28:38] stood and said all power in heaven and
[28:40] earth
[28:41] when he said that people we were still
[28:44] inside of that body
[28:46] because eternal life hadn't been given
[28:48] right nobody had to eternal life outside
[28:50] of Jesus Christ at that time when he
[28:52] said that even the 40 days he walked
[28:54] after the resurrection there's no person
[28:57] could say I have eternal life in my soul
[29:00] so Jesus is the only one that had it and
[29:02] when he said something and I'm inside of
[29:04] him I just have to believe it
[29:07] because 10 days later he said go to
[29:09] Jerusalem and he said in other words
[29:10] you'll get some of this
[29:12] yeah but there was not enough word
[29:15] the word came pure and unadulterated in
[29:18] that first age
[29:19] but it was eat down and eroded in the
[29:22] church ages to where man took their own
[29:25] ideas
[29:26] and their own fellowship and their own
[29:29] ideas of the word of God and they made a
[29:32] denomination
[29:33] and when they did that they died
[29:37] so there's death anyway I don't like
[29:39] anything says death except for me to die
[29:41] to myself and I like that all right but
[29:44] here we come up to this age this is the
[29:46] last age but it says the beginning of
[29:49] the creation of God you'd think it would
[29:52] have said that back in
[29:53] Paul's age
[29:56] right but he said it in the seventh age
[29:59] the beginning of the creation of God
[30:02] we'll let you think about that for a
[30:04] couple weeks amen all right Lord bless
[30:07] you
