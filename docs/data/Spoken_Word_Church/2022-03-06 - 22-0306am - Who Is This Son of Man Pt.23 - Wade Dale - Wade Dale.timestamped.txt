[0:41] for what all men asked of you
[0:44] i i thought part of the scripture i'm
[0:46] reading this morning
[0:48] i was in the barber shop the other day
[0:50] when i walked in
[0:51] they were discussing
[0:54] should we
[0:56] go to church or just
[0:58] gather wherever we wanted to
[1:01] and he said well i don't
[1:02] i don't i don't have an answer to out
[1:04] the bible but
[1:06] anyway i said well there's the answer
[1:08] in the bible for what you were asking
[1:11] exactly but he wanted that was all he
[1:13] wanted to hear
[1:14] what he had spoken
[1:16] and
[1:17] people asked you a question
[1:19] with the answer already in that question
[1:22] but if you know
[1:24] what jesus christ won't
[1:26] you answer the way he tell you too
[1:29] we're going to read this morning from
[1:33] hebrews
[1:35] the
[1:37] 10th chapter
[1:38] verses 19 through

[2:36] heaven therefore brothering
[2:38] bones to and into the holiness
[2:41] of the blood of jesus
[2:53] and having in high priest over the house
[2:56] of god
[3:09] let us hold fast the profession
[3:12] of our faith without wavering for he is
[3:16] faithful that promised
[3:20] [Music]
[3:25] forsaking
[3:27] dissemina not forsaking the assembly
[3:30] of ourselves together as the manner of
[3:32] some is
[3:33] but exhorting one another and so much
[3:36] more
[3:38] as
[3:39] you see the day approaching
[3:51] but a certain and fearful looking for
[3:54] the judgment of the fire in the nation
[3:57] which shall devour the adversaries
[4:07] how much
[4:09] of how
[4:10] much sober punishment i suppose ye
[4:13] shall he be through worthy
[4:16] who has tried
[4:18] under the foot of the son of god and has
[4:21] counted the blood of covenant
[4:24] wherewith he
[4:26] was sacrificed an unholy thing
[4:29] and has done despite
[4:32] the spirit of grace
[4:46] it is a fearful thing to fall into the
[4:49] hands of the living god amen
[4:52] god bless you maybe
[4:56] praise the lord
[5:02] praise the lord jesus amen
[5:05] said fail not to assume yourself
[5:06] together especially as we see these days
[5:08] in this time
[5:10] in my my mind
[5:12] no hiding place but accepting jesus
[5:14] christ
[5:16] hallelujah i was speaking with a friend
[5:17] of mine from from ukraine
[5:20] yesterday and um
[5:22] he was just telling me you know how
[5:24] you know they grew up with russians all
[5:26] around them i mean it was just normal
[5:29] and um you know what he's saying putin
[5:31] is saying is he's trying to take it back
[5:33] 300 years ago you know to how things
[5:36] were at certain times and
[5:38] they've really seen him as like he's
[5:39] lost his mind like he's out of his mind
[5:43] and um
[5:45] i said you know in my mind just talking
[5:47] to him i'm like
[5:48] we know it's just spirits it's it's
[5:50] spirits
[5:51] but god is having his purpose brought
[5:53] forth you know and of course they don't
[5:55] know how this thing is going to stop or
[5:58] will it stop be but you know they're
[5:59] saying he's going to go you know once
[6:01] you get ukraine he's going to keep going
[6:03] and he said it's he said it didn't just
[6:04] start now he's been doing this he's been
[6:06] preparing this you know the different
[6:08] countries over there georgia and belarus
[6:11] all those areas he said he's been going
[6:13] in and taking over these places it's
[6:15] just now it's more visible
[6:17] you know he's been on this this mission
[6:19] you know to to reclaim
[6:21] what ussr all these countries that that
[6:23] split off and nato has taken these
[6:25] countries has been taking these
[6:26] countries over
[6:28] you know for some years now and that's
[6:30] kind of what he's opposed so he's trying
[6:32] to bring the ussr back together and
[6:35] my you know he's telling me the missiles
[6:37] that the u.s got i guess we got some
[6:39] submarine over there got like 20 atomic
[6:41] bombs aimed at 20 cities in russia
[6:44] so putin knows if he does anything
[6:47] and they got their weapons as we know
[6:49] from our prophets so it's like any
[6:51] any day anytime
[6:53] you know so we just got to hide in jesus

[15:59] verse 1 and let's pray before we get

[16:02] day we thank you for the people that
[16:04] have come here lord to worship you in
[16:06] spirit and truth now i pray lord that
[16:07] you take over this service that you be
[16:09] the active participant lord you be the
[16:11] one that does the speaking and the
[16:12] hearing lord and reveal to us lord what
[16:15] we need for this end time father we pray
[16:17] that you'll be with the ones that are
[16:18] sick be with the ones lord overseas and
[16:20] ukraine and all the different believers
[16:22] around the world
[16:23] lord has just become a
[16:25] just become a everyday thing lord for
[16:27] something to come up and there be a
[16:29] sickness or a death or or something
[16:31] going on but lord you said when we hear
[16:33] wars and rumors of wars
[16:35] to look up
[16:36] because our redemption draws nigh
[16:38] thank you god that you sent us a prophet
[16:40] to tell us these things so we we don't
[16:42] worry so much
[16:44] that we know that not one atomic bomb is
[16:46] going to hit this earth until the
[16:47] bride's out of here
[16:48] so we pray lord that you would just take
[16:50] the fear away from the people let us
[16:52] focus on you because we've got to finish
[16:54] this journey lord
[16:55] this journey has got to be completed and
[16:57] we which are alive and remain shall be
[16:59] waiting lord for the resurrection and
[17:02] that's what we're heading to now lord we
[17:03] pray that you sanctify us lord for this
[17:05] journey in jesus name we pray
[17:07] amen
[17:08] all right this is who is the son of man
[17:10] who is this son of man part 23 so
[17:13] a little slow but we're all southerners
[17:15] and that's okay
[17:17] but i've been enjoying it i saw some
[17:19] things yesterday that i had not seen
[17:20] before and i'll share them with you this
[17:22] afternoon
[17:24] in the beginning was the word
[17:26] and the word was with god
[17:29] and the word was god
[17:31] all right let's go to verse 14.
[17:34] and the word was made flesh
[17:37] and dwelt among us
[17:39] and we beheld his glory the glory as if
[17:40] the only begotten of the father
[17:43] full of grace
[17:44] and truth you may be seated in the lord
[17:46] at his blessing to the reading of the
[17:47] word
[17:48] now remember as we've been talking
[17:50] on this series that
[17:52] that we know that pertains to jesus
[17:54] christ we know that god
[17:56] promised us a redeemer
[17:58] and that redeemer had to be a kinsman
[18:01] he couldn't be melchizedek
[18:04] even though melchizedek was god
[18:07] because he was not our brother
[18:09] this man that's going to take away the
[18:11] sin of the world is going to have to be
[18:13] a man
[18:14] a flesh man that's going to come into
[18:16] this earth be born like me and you
[18:17] except without sex but born like me and
[18:20] you
[18:21] amen and that's going to be the savior
[18:24] of the world
[18:25] and that is what the scripture calls the
[18:28] son of man
[18:29] because that is a man a god man in human
[18:32] flesh well now what we've been talking
[18:34] about though is is why why just say that
[18:38] about jesus
[18:40] i thought the bible said year god's who
[18:42] the word of the lord comes to and the
[18:44] prophet of god tells us he said with the
[18:46] holy ghost inside of you he said that's
[18:47] deity dwelling and dwelling inside of
[18:49] you
[18:50] so where is that word being made flesh
[18:52] now it's being made flesh in me and you
[18:54] amen because that's our mandate that's
[18:56] our call in the end time is as brother
[18:59] bob and the different ones we've all
[19:00] kind of got on the same page a little
[19:02] bit but that's good because
[19:05] it's the time
[19:08] it's the time for that sure there's a
[19:10] time we still got people we need saved
[19:12] that are lost and all these different
[19:13] things but there's a time that we have
[19:15] been predestinated we're going to read
[19:17] it today to adoption
[19:20] all right which is placing not just in
[19:22] your birth and this afternoon
[19:25] um not this morning but this afternoon
[19:27] i'm going to do what i said i was going
[19:28] to do
[19:29] because your placing is not your birth
[19:32] there's a new birth and then there's an
[19:33] adoption or the placing or the
[19:35] manifestation and there their you can
[19:38] have the new birth without being adopted
[19:40] but you can't get adopted without having
[19:42] the new birth amen and the new birth is
[19:45] the birth of the word inside of your
[19:46] heart it's the lord jesus christ
[19:48] residing in your soul
[19:51] not just
[19:53] temporary
[19:54] amen we're okay with that
[19:58] but remember when he left here he gave a
[20:00] commission
[20:01] that he was going to have a bride on the
[20:04] earth a body that was going to continue
[20:07] his ministry
[20:09] his ministry wasn't over when he when he
[20:11] uh ascended no that's just when he got
[20:13] started
[20:14] and it had to be started in what man in
[20:17] human flesh with god inside of him
[20:22] right
[20:24] that's kind of the way jesus was except
[20:26] remember we're born of carnality and he
[20:28] was not born of carnality but he came to
[20:30] what bring it all back or redeem us
[20:34] back to our inheritance remember i
[20:37] the quote that i that i love that you
[20:39] that you i can almost quote it verbatim
[20:41] in the adoption series where brother
[20:43] branham said that jesus didn't come to
[20:45] give you an inheritance
[20:49] and boy when you preach that to people
[20:50] that are not well taught they'll look at
[20:52] you cross-eyed
[20:54] have that furrow in between there you
[20:56] know
[20:56] what
[20:58] think about it jesus didn't come to to
[21:00] give you an inheritance
[21:03] our bible tells us that our inheritance
[21:06] was in the lamb's book of life before
[21:08] the foundation of the world amen so
[21:11] that's where our inheritance was we just
[21:13] got lost from
[21:14] it jesus christ had to come down to what
[21:17] bring you to your inheritance jesus said
[21:20] i am the way the truth and the life
[21:22] right
[21:23] what was he doing he was making a way i
[21:25] am the door i am the way he kept telling
[21:28] us that he was the passageway from life
[21:31] from death and to life
[21:33] but that inheritance was not developed
[21:35] down here
[21:38] redemption was but redemption was before
[21:41] the foundational world too but your
[21:43] inheritance was that your name was put
[21:44] on a lamb's book of life before the
[21:46] foundation of the world if you are the
[21:48] bride of jesus christ
[21:51] that's a big if it's a big word
[21:54] if
[21:55] you're born again your name was written
[21:57] in the lamb's book of life
[21:59] before the foundation of the world the
[22:00] eternal section so for what let's go to
[22:02] colossians 1 and let's continue on
[22:06] and he is the head of the body of the
[22:08] church
[22:09] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[22:11] the dead that in all things
[22:13] he might have preeminence now look that
[22:15] word up and we'll look in the greek
[22:16] lexicon that is to be first or hold the
[22:20] first place
[22:21] now do we
[22:23] do that with god
[22:28] do we give him first place in everything
[22:32] no we don't
[22:34] if you do i want to you need to come up
[22:35] here
[22:37] but we're heading toward that though
[22:39] we're heading to that it's not something
[22:41] insurmountable it's not something we
[22:42] can't get to jesus said be there for
[22:44] perfect this my father in heaven is
[22:45] perfect
[22:47] growth development as we were talking
[22:49] about last sunday
[22:51] you know little mordecai was mortified
[22:54] when i brought him up here
[22:56] but
[22:57] but he had all his faculty to drive a
[23:00] car
[23:03] but because of his immaturity
[23:06] that's why some of us you know it's not
[23:08] bad for marty at nine years old to be
[23:10] immature
[23:12] when you're 49
[23:14] and immature
[23:16] we got a problem
[23:18] okay
[23:20] but that's what god does too god says
[23:22] okay you're a baby i don't expect you to
[23:24] do all these things i don't expect you
[23:25] to handle yourself or conduct yourself
[23:28] like somebody that's been in the you
[23:31] know been born again for 30 40 years
[23:34] but he does expect us to grow
[23:36] he gives us the tools to grow
[23:39] in grace and knowledge but to be the
[23:41] first or to hold the first place
[23:45] do all things that we you know the bible
[23:47] says seek ye first what the kingdom of
[23:48] heaven
[23:49] what we were talking about last night
[23:50] what is the kingdom of heaven the
[23:52] baptism of the holy ghost the promise
[23:55] and that's what gets you into this line
[23:57] of adoption you're just dad many years
[23:59] ago he said look he said satan god's not
[24:02] going to adopt satan's kids
[24:05] he adopts his own kids
[24:08] and man so he must have children
[24:10] and having children we are in the line
[24:13] of adoption let's continue on a little
[24:14] bit further romans 8 verse 14 for as
[24:16] many as are led by the spirit of god
[24:19] they are the sons of god
[24:20] for you have not received now look you
[24:22] have not received the spirit of bondage
[24:24] again to fear
[24:25] i'm
[24:27] i i'm cautious
[24:29] uh we talk about ukraine in different
[24:31] things you
[24:32] be cautious about what you see and what
[24:35] you hear
[24:37] because there was something on facebook
[24:38] the other day that showed people
[24:40] standing out in this field and here
[24:42] comes these rockets and here comes these
[24:43] jets and boom boom boom and bam bam bam
[24:46] and it told about this rocket and that
[24:48] rocket and this patriot missile and that
[24:50] going on and and i thought man that's
[24:52] pretty neat that you could sit there and
[24:54] watch that you know it's all out war
[24:56] well i've walked in church wednesday
[24:58] night and joe brother joe canada said
[24:59] did you see that i said yeah he said it
[25:01] was fake
[25:04] it was a video game
[25:07] that somebody had superimposed people
[25:09] standing in front of it watching
[25:12] and it was a stupid video game
[25:15] so do we believe everything we see you
[25:17] better not
[25:18] hey man you better not and then somebody
[25:21] you know somebody start the phone starts
[25:22] ringing when he's talking about nuclear
[25:26] well that's my point have you received
[25:29] this
[25:30] is everything something fearful to you
[25:34] the prophet of god told us and i am
[25:35] going to everybody believed brother
[25:37] brown was the prophet amen god sent a
[25:39] prophet in the end time okay just want
[25:40] to make sure we was talking to the same
[25:42] crowd
[25:45] anyway
[25:46] but he said not one bomb nuclear bomb
[25:49] would hit this earth
[25:51] while the bride's still here so i don't
[25:53] care they can talk about all this
[25:54] nuclear this and nuclear that
[25:57] folks put that fear away
[26:01] put that fair away
[26:03] but now the only fear you better have is
[26:04] whether you're born again or not
[26:07] because if you're born again you're
[26:08] under that pavilion you're under that
[26:10] shelter and you will take a rapture
[26:14] before that happens
[26:16] so don't worry about it
[26:19] phones goes to ringing people did you
[26:20] hear
[26:22] lord mercy
[26:24] all they done was bombed a place where
[26:26] they made nuclear
[26:28] um
[26:29] whatever it was and power plants what it
[26:31] was come on
[26:33] quit wasting time
[26:35] let's don't be and i say silly women i
[26:37] read that scripture a lot in my head and
[26:39] it's not you silly women
[26:42] you see what you already started
[26:43] laughing before i was going to tell you
[26:44] what it was
[26:46] but it's bride it's the church
[26:49] silly women
[26:51] pulled away from every little something
[26:53] that goes on everybody goes to the bomb
[26:55] shelter
[26:56] and won't come to church
[27:01] this is my shelter
[27:03] this is my pavilion that god has given
[27:06] me a place to come to
[27:11] listen folks do you have fear when you
[27:13] come here
[27:16] that ought to shed at the door
[27:18] you should have no fear here
[27:21] oh i'm afraid that no
[27:23] don't be afraid
[27:25] god's given us a resting place
[27:27] he's given us a kingdom
[27:29] that listen you know what we're not
[27:31] gonna need new nuclear fuel
[27:35] the bible said the lamb's alike
[27:37] the lamb will produce all the light we
[27:39] need but you know what he's got little
[27:40] bitty lights
[27:43] he's got me and you to shine the light
[27:45] down here
[27:47] and before i get any further the bible
[27:48] study next we have it for first saturday
[27:51] of every month from six to eight next
[27:53] week next month we have a topic
[27:56] it is the rapture
[27:58] the millennium and the future home we're
[27:59] gonna take all those three topics and
[28:02] discuss them and if you have any
[28:03] questions about them write them down
[28:06] for those of you that don't come
[28:08] i don't mean that bad but those of you
[28:09] that can't come we do record it
[28:12] and and i think brother joe didn't put
[28:14] it online so you can you can i know
[28:16] people can't get there on saturday night
[28:18] so that's okay we have people that live
[28:19] a long way from here
[28:21] that couldn't come and then go back so
[28:23] we understand that so that's why brother
[28:24] joe and and the technicians they've
[28:26] always recorded what we what we say it's
[28:28] totally informal drink coffee drink a
[28:31] coca-cola
[28:33] sister gabby brings us
[28:35] some glorious wonderful
[28:38] lots of stuff to eat
[28:40] and so does sister trudy
[28:43] man brownie's in the millennium i think
[28:45] that's the next thing we're going to
[28:46] talk on
[28:49] chocolate and german chocolate cake
[28:51] nobody's yet to bring me a german
[28:53] chocolate cake at bible study though so
[28:54] that's okay
[28:55] that's all right didn't even get one for
[28:57] my birthday i'm gonna ramble on romans 8
[28:59] verse 14
[29:00] for as many as they're led by the spirit
[29:02] of god look they are the sons of god and
[29:04] really brother louise wednesday night
[29:06] just he just nailed it on the head
[29:09] to help you realize all those things
[29:11] that are positive already happening
[29:15] now are we the sons of god
[29:18] now but we've got to go to the part that
[29:20] says waiting for the manifestation of
[29:22] the sons of god so there's a waiting
[29:24] period or a placing like morty
[29:28] morty can't drive a car it would be a
[29:30] disaster but that same guy
[29:33] if the lord tarries another
[29:36] eight years
[29:38] he'll be 17.
[29:40] he'll be able to drive a car because he
[29:42] has come to some point of maturity and
[29:44] then he passed the test that the state
[29:46] of georgia said you got to pass this
[29:47] test before you can drive you got to
[29:49] show these skills
[29:52] well that's what we've been talking or
[29:53] getting ready to start talking about is
[29:55] start using those skills that you have
[29:57] and man same way we were talking about
[29:59] the other day about going to school
[30:02] use the skills that you were given in
[30:03] school
[30:05] amen
[30:06] same way here
[30:09] for you have not received the spirit of
[30:10] bondage again to fear
[30:12] but you have received the spirit of
[30:14] adoption
[30:15] whereby you cry daddy daddy or abba
[30:17] father
[30:18] we all become babies
[30:21] we all start as babies
[30:23] every christian that's ever started has
[30:24] started a baby except the 120 in the
[30:27] upper room
[30:31] because they were tutored and trained by
[30:33] god himself for three and a half years
[30:35] right so they were a mature church peter
[30:38] walked straight out says this is that
[30:40] and then just a few days later he's
[30:41] walking through the courtyard and he
[30:43] sees this guy and he can't walk he said
[30:45] silver and gold have on none where did
[30:46] he get that from
[30:48] he got the power and authority listen
[30:50] god had already given them jesus christ
[30:52] had already given them authority
[30:54] to cast out devils
[30:57] do all those things while he was here
[31:01] and then when they got the holy ghost
[31:02] they know now how to use it
[31:08] justification sanctification
[31:10] by the time you get to the holy ghost
[31:11] you ought to know at least a little bit
[31:14] number one that you're in the family
[31:18] and number two that god's gonna use you
[31:19] he's just not gonna let you sit there
[31:21] and drop as a baby unless you want to
[31:26] take the bottle
[31:28] little cambrie back there man she's so
[31:30] little she's so fragile but give her
[31:32] about another 20 years oh lisa and
[31:35] terence will be old give you another 20
[31:37] years
[31:38] and she'll be this beautiful
[31:40] blonde i hope
[31:42] girl
[31:43] that's been through college hopefully by
[31:45] then and you understand what i mean
[31:46] that's the same way with god but i was
[31:47] reading a quote just a few minutes ago
[31:49] well this morning
[31:51] the the only difference in me and you
[31:53] though is we don't know what our kids
[31:54] are going to do
[31:56] we just give them the best guidance and
[31:57] we give them the best care and we send
[31:59] them to school
[32:00] we buy their books we give them car gas
[32:02] money and all that stuff blah blah blah
[32:05] and but god knows where you're going
[32:09] we don't know where our kids naturally
[32:11] are going but god knows where his kids
[32:13] are going
[32:14] therefore he can place you in a place
[32:18] in a
[32:20] teaching ministry or a evangelical
[32:22] ministry or or this ministry of that
[32:24] ministry we'll read it here in a few
[32:25] minutes but i just don't think that
[32:28] sitting under a evangelistic message all
[32:30] the time you're not going to come to
[32:31] adoption
[32:33] because the bib because brother around
[32:34] said teaching
[32:36] places you now there's your placing it
[32:38] doesn't it doesn't you can get listen
[32:40] like brother brown said you can put an
[32:42] egg under a dog and it'll it'll hatch
[32:46] but it's going to realize who it is
[32:48] after a while
[32:49] hey man it's going to look funny
[32:51] remember the eagle and all that in the
[32:52] barnyard the eagle looked a little funny
[32:55] why because he was different
[32:59] but he was born in the chicken yard
[33:01] amen
[33:03] for as many are led by the spirit of god
[33:05] they are the sons of god we already read
[33:06] that all right let's go now we're going
[33:07] to talk about headship
[33:09] in just a few minutes
[33:11] and let's read what brother brown said
[33:12] on the layout to see in church age
[33:14] number one but now he's standing in the
[33:16] midst of the church as he stands there
[33:17] revealing who he is in this last age he
[33:20] calls himself the author of the creation
[33:22] of god
[33:23] this is another creation
[33:26] this has to do with the church
[33:28] this is a special designation of himself
[33:31] god's going to make sure he has adult
[33:34] children
[33:36] he's going to because he already saw it
[33:38] by four knowledge by predestination he's
[33:41] already saw what was gonna happen
[33:45] you and i just gotta fall in line
[33:47] know our position that's what we'll talk
[33:49] about this afternoon
[33:50] this is a special designation of himself
[33:53] he is the creator of that church our
[33:55] bride
[33:59] if he's the beginning of the creation
[34:01] you and i are the rest of that creation
[34:03] amen
[34:04] the heavenly bridegroom created his own
[34:07] bride now i took a little bit out at the
[34:09] same time i took one paragraph i'm sorry
[34:12] i am not editing brother adam just for
[34:14] time brother brown says about two
[34:16] paragraphs later this is the true
[34:17] revelation of god
[34:20] what is the true revelation of god that
[34:22] he's going to have a church a bride
[34:24] it's going to be his and not the devils
[34:27] it's not going to be the nomination it's
[34:28] going to be the bride
[34:34] that's just the way he's going to have
[34:35] it
[34:36] because he's already seen it happen
[34:38] you've just got to figure out whether
[34:39] you're a part of it or not
[34:44] search your own salvation with fear and
[34:45] trembling the bible tells us
[34:47] all right let's look too there's two or
[34:49] three things we were talking about the
[34:50] other day and one was dispensation
[34:53] i know the prophet of god said he was a
[34:54] dispensationalist but in the bible
[34:57] says in the dispensation of the fullness
[34:59] of time so whoever wrote the bible must
[35:01] believe in dispensations
[35:03] you and i always we believe in
[35:05] dispensations or stages
[35:07] i've got it wrote our anointing
[35:10] there's a different anointing for a
[35:11] different for your different age because
[35:13] remember luther and wesley luther's
[35:15] anointing was that just shall live by
[35:17] faith he could sit in a pub and drink
[35:19] beer and smoke a pipe and talk about god
[35:20] and be born again you can't do that
[35:23] different dispensation different stage
[35:25] of god's word
[35:27] and it's a different anointing same god
[35:31] thank god as we were talking last night
[35:32] we were talking about angels and
[35:34] guardian angels listen it's the same god
[35:37] it's just different anointings and and
[35:39] and i believe we do have guardian angels
[35:44] my sister is beat all the pieces
[35:48] because he slaps me in the back of the
[35:49] head all the time
[35:52] but it's not a different god
[35:54] it's just a different anointing
[35:57] jesus got an anointing for his ministry
[35:58] on the river jordan that didn't make him
[36:00] god
[36:01] he was god when he was born
[36:03] the bible said he was born emmanuel
[36:06] god with us and on the river jordan he
[36:08] was what he was anointed
[36:11] for a three and a half year job to do a
[36:12] ministry to do and then the prophet of
[36:14] god tells you i believe it's in the in
[36:16] this same series yes it is in the
[36:18] adoption series he said the spirit left
[36:20] him in the garden went out the spirit
[36:21] left him in the garden he died
[36:28] it was an anointing that left him that
[36:29] same anointing that came on him three
[36:31] and a half years ago
[36:32] that anointing came off of him so he
[36:34] could die
[36:36] because without anointing on him he
[36:37] could not die
[36:39] many times you read where whether he
[36:41] slept through the crowd or they were
[36:42] gonna they they took him out was gonna
[36:44] throw him off a cliff
[36:46] he just
[36:47] changed their eyesight and walked right
[36:50] through among them
[36:51] just like elisha did and geheza when
[36:53] they changed the syrians eyes and there
[36:56] stood elisha they said who are you
[36:57] looking for we're looking for elijah hey
[36:59] we're looking right at him
[37:01] and we're looking right at elisha
[37:03] and he so fooled him he said oh i know
[37:05] where the army is at and he takes them
[37:07] down in the middle of them and god opens
[37:09] the syrian's eyes right in the middle of
[37:11] the camp and there was no battle
[37:12] god had already won
[37:17] do y'all realize that god does that to
[37:19] the
[37:20] devil he does that to the devil he lets
[37:23] the devil think he can do anything he
[37:24] wants to with you and all of a sudden
[37:26] he'll put you in a situation
[37:29] and he'll say oh
[37:31] look devil
[37:32] what do you do with job
[37:36] job wasn't wasn't making any noise at
[37:38] all
[37:40] he was just doing what god said to do
[37:42] and god said
[37:44] have you considered my servant job
[37:47] he actually took satan's his attention
[37:50] and put it on job
[37:53] but see he's so blind to joe he's so
[37:55] blinded satan though because satan
[37:56] thought yeah i'll make him curse you and
[37:58] die
[37:59] i'll make him curse the day he was born
[38:01] well he pretty much almost did but he
[38:03] never cursed god
[38:06] and then when he got to the very end of
[38:07] it satan was like well you he needs to
[38:09] just die the lord said no i'm gonna give
[38:11] him double what he had to start with
[38:13] you think he was successful the first
[38:15] time you saw him you just hang around a
[38:16] little while i'm gonna make him
[38:17] successful again
[38:19] same way with me and you
[38:21] all the trials and tribulations that we
[38:23] go through last night we had a real good
[38:25] testimony service
[38:28] people testified how god had been with
[38:29] them through their life and the
[38:30] different things they've done
[38:32] or been or been taken away from well you
[38:34] know what that was god
[38:36] that was god doing that for screwing
[38:38] angels
[38:39] i believe in angels i just believe
[38:41] there's all bunches of them
[38:42] there's bunches of angels
[38:45] all right but they're all
[38:47] put here
[38:49] the bible says for the heirs of
[38:50] salvation
[38:52] to guide you and direct you
[38:56] i just that's just the way i see it you
[38:58] may see it a different way but that's
[38:59] okay
[39:01] but look we believe in dispensations and
[39:03] stages and anointings
[39:05] and then what will happen is and i bring
[39:07] the quote this time but the prophet of
[39:09] god tells us he said he said here's the
[39:11] box
[39:14] and this is the church ages he was
[39:15] talking about the church he said each
[39:17] church age had an anointing and they
[39:18] couldn't do anything but go by that
[39:20] anointing
[39:22] luther couldn't preach wesley's message
[39:25] wesley couldn't preach pentecost message
[39:27] the people took this message and were
[39:29] sealed in the next one took him were
[39:31] sealed in next one took him were sealed
[39:33] well guess which one we're in we're in
[39:34] the box of adoption
[39:36] where we have to come to maturity listen
[39:39] we've got all
[39:41] the resources
[39:43] that none of the other ages had
[39:45] look at the resources we have uh we can
[39:48] put the message on our on our watch
[39:52] and this whole wall used to be when this
[39:54] church was first started that whole wall
[39:56] was eight inch reels
[40:00] you couldn't carry hardly one in a
[40:02] pocketbook
[40:04] and now you can carry all 1100 of them
[40:06] plus the bible in 26 translations
[40:11] on your phone on your on your phone on
[40:13] your
[40:14] apple watch
[40:17] well then what are we doing about it
[40:21] there's no excuse
[40:22] for us to say i can't carry all that
[40:24] whole bunch of books around or i can't
[40:26] carry them eight inch reels everywhere i
[40:27] go and then see remember though the tape
[40:29] player was this big it wasn't just eight
[40:31] inch reels you had to have a tape player
[40:33] some of you are shaking your head
[40:34] because that's what we came through i
[40:36] mean the thing was this big and you
[40:37] turned it on and you carly couldn't
[40:39] hardly couldn't hear it and
[40:41] but look at now
[40:43] we've got everything we need
[40:46] but but once god gives it to us he
[40:48] requires that we use it
[40:50] we can't have any excuse
[40:52] because we've moved from dispensation
[40:55] of the holy ghost and even the
[40:57] dispensation of god sent a prophet
[41:01] i believe brother brown said this is a
[41:03] bright age
[41:04] i believe that he said this is the brown
[41:06] age so we moved into the bride age not
[41:09] negating brother brown listen there's no
[41:11] way you can understand anything without
[41:12] that man coming
[41:14] i don't know why in the world people
[41:15] want to want to nick pitt and nick pick
[41:18] him
[41:18] he took me to god
[41:20] he showed me god more clear than anybody
[41:23] has ever shown me god
[41:25] amen
[41:26] and every time i read stories and read
[41:28] all the things that he that he's talking
[41:30] about i get a clear picture of this god
[41:32] that i'm serving amen
[41:36] that's why but we don't turn our face
[41:39] always to the prophet though
[41:42] the prophet jesus christ
[41:44] but we heard him through that trumpet
[41:46] but now listen
[41:48] your mandate and my mandate now is to
[41:50] make that become alive
[41:53] because without making it coming alive
[41:55] come alive it was in vain and god won't
[41:58] do anything in vain he didn't send a
[41:59] mighty man on this earth just for no
[42:01] purpose at all
[42:02] he sent it so that me and you
[42:05] could receive
[42:07] this message
[42:09] from god
[42:11] and be able to talk to god more clearly
[42:13] than anybody's ever been able to talk to
[42:14] god
[42:15] even the prophets in the old testament
[42:17] they wanted to see god like me and you
[42:19] see god today
[42:21] listen to this we talk about
[42:22] dispensations
[42:24] questions and answers on the seals we've
[42:26] already read this but let me read it
[42:27] again
[42:29] everybody all right
[42:31] kind of slowing down a little bit you
[42:33] know
[42:33] background a little bit more that's okay
[42:35] we got plenty of time
[42:37] brother branham he's he's preaching the
[42:40] seals
[42:42] the most powerful messages he said he's
[42:45] ever preached in his life
[42:48] come in march of 1963
[42:51] when the lord i believe adopted that man
[42:53] and give him the keys gave him the
[42:55] checkbook and whatever he wrote that's
[42:57] what it was going to be
[42:58] the seals opened
[43:00] to the prophet
[43:01] and he preached six of them
[43:03] and he was having questions and answers
[43:05] on the seals you see it behind me
[43:08] and brother brown comes to the seal to
[43:10] the six to after he preached the six
[43:12] seals he said okay we're gonna have
[43:13] questions and answers tomorrow
[43:15] he said i don't want any questions
[43:17] except about the seals
[43:19] because that's why you've been preaching
[43:20] for six days in a row
[43:23] and the greatest i mean the headstone
[43:24] message was back it was there
[43:27] and they asked him could they wear
[43:29] pantyhose or pajamas to bed
[43:32] they asked him about the name of the
[43:33] lord jesus christ in baptism they asked
[43:36] him about only two questions out of 20
[43:38] or 30 questions about the seals so he
[43:40] knew they weren't getting it and this is
[43:42] what he's going to tell them right here
[43:45] and i know you that you don't see it
[43:48] see i'm just positive that you don't see
[43:51] it you say brother brown that's a hard
[43:53] thing to say i know but look
[43:55] let me just say this now i suppose this
[43:57] is taped and we know it is you don't get
[43:59] it
[44:01] and you're not supposed to get it
[44:05] so don't try to interpret anything see
[44:07] don't try to put your interpretation to
[44:09] it you'll only get further
[44:11] away
[44:12] that dispensation was what restoring of
[44:15] the gifts the prophet to god was
[44:17] restoring true worship
[44:19] just as elijah did and on mount carmel
[44:22] he restored the altar he restored he put
[44:24] the worship back together he brought the
[44:26] name of the lord jesus christ and
[44:28] baptism back in power he brought the
[44:30] trinity that it was no good all the
[44:33] different doctrines he had brought him
[44:34] to this place right here
[44:36] and he was saying okay you can get that
[44:38] you've got that that's your dispensation
[44:41] because if you'll continue with this
[44:43] quote he says there's
[44:45] voices
[44:46] and images running through this building
[44:48] right now back and forth and there is
[44:50] today more than it was then
[44:52] images running through this building he
[44:54] said if you had the right crystal
[44:59] diamond
[45:00] if you had the right crystal you could
[45:02] pick up what was let me just put it in
[45:04] my own words brother ryan was saying
[45:05] look
[45:07] you're not here to get it
[45:08] because you don't have the right crystal
[45:10] it's not saying you don't have the new
[45:12] birth
[45:13] but you don't have the right crystal to
[45:15] pick up the right signal
[45:16] because you're in this dispensation
[45:19] they weren't in the dispensation of
[45:21] adoption
[45:22] they were still pentecostal babies
[45:25] sorry to say but that's what brother
[45:27] brown said
[45:28] pentecostal babbling babies and he knew
[45:30] though but he didn't he didn't just
[45:32] throw the baby out with the bathwater
[45:35] he said go on and live a simple
[45:37] christian life is the rest of the quote
[45:40] because you'll get twisted away from it
[45:42] because it's not your time to see it
[45:44] but folks let me say one thing's for
[45:46] sure
[45:48] thus saith the lord
[45:51] this is the time
[45:53] the crystal is here now the right people
[45:56] are in the right place at the right time
[46:01] you and me
[46:04] i'll read a quote next week brother
[46:06] brown says brother and sister he talks
[46:07] about adoption time we're going to pour
[46:10] out an anointing on this church
[46:13] on this bride of jesus christ there'll
[46:15] be an anointing that's coming
[46:18] and it's still it's here i believe
[46:21] but he said what you've seen in part
[46:24] part
[46:26] hundreds of thousands of people healed
[46:29] innumerable
[46:30] innumerable amount of people raised from
[46:32] the dead
[46:34] and he said that's part
[46:36] you know why because it was one man
[46:38] now we've got a bride in ukraine we've
[46:40] got a bride in a hundred and whatever
[46:42] country that we got bride there that
[46:44] miracles are happening every single day
[46:47] amen
[46:48] and greater this than you will do
[46:50] jesus said because i go to my father
[46:52] and now where's the father in you all
[46:56] right so let's move on a little bit
[46:58] so don't interpret it he said because
[47:00] you'll get further away from it
[47:03] he laid it out in that message
[47:07] that there's a group coming with the
[47:10] right kind of crystal
[47:12] that's been taught right
[47:13] let's come to maturity
[47:16] because as as i was speaking a couple
[47:18] weeks ago
[47:19] you will never
[47:21] understand that
[47:23] the all
[47:25] the revelation of the seven seals
[47:26] without coming to adoption
[47:30] that's just the way it is
[47:32] that's just the way the dispensations
[47:33] fall that's just the way the stages are
[47:35] immature christians cannot understand
[47:38] the seals
[47:41] because the seals is given for what the
[47:42] redemption of your body not to save you
[47:48] not to save you there's not a salvation
[47:50] issue
[47:51] but if you're sitting here today and you
[47:53] are in the same place you were when you
[47:55] first got born again that you got
[47:57] malnourished somewhere
[47:58] somewhere you didn't get sheep food
[48:04] and we've all wasted our time okay
[48:06] we've all wasted our time in different
[48:08] places and different things and
[48:09] different i wasted mine in the world
[48:11] okay
[48:14] but thank god he called one time
[48:17] and i answered that one and so did you
[48:20] amen
[48:21] you know why because everybody's got to
[48:24] be in the right place at the right time
[48:27] the actors have got to be on the stage
[48:29] your writers are going to have to be
[48:31] where they are your your anointing is
[48:33] going to have to be exactly where it's
[48:35] at
[48:38] and
[48:39] and i know
[48:40] luis
[48:41] i'm going to tell you anyway
[48:43] have you ever seen them watch the movie
[48:45] stargate
[48:48] louise always
[48:49] it's on netflix
[48:52] just i'm just kidding
[48:53] but anyway there's a gate that goes
[48:55] between heaven and earth and this guy
[48:57] finds it but what has to happen he has
[48:59] to do things you see how the devil is
[49:01] imitating god
[49:03] through these movies but i watched this
[49:04] long time ago not not recently but
[49:06] anyway something would happen and and
[49:09] part of that portal would turn
[49:11] well when it turned it's almost like a
[49:13] have you ever watched people open an old
[49:15] safe there's there's tumblers inside
[49:18] when you stop at this one point a
[49:19] tumbler goes down then it turns the
[49:21] whole thing around to the next place a
[49:24] tumbler drops and you turn it back this
[49:26] way and what it's doing is turning all
[49:27] those rings well that's what happened i
[49:29] believe that's what's happening with us
[49:32] there's a portal between heaven and
[49:33] earth
[49:34] between mortal and immortality and then
[49:37] there's a gate there jesus said i'm the
[49:38] way the truth and the life and we if we
[49:40] don't understand him we're not going
[49:43] but what happened was as the guy went
[49:44] through his life that thing would turn
[49:46] and it would catch when it would catch
[49:48] it would take the second ring around it
[49:50] would catch and then finally he got to
[49:52] enter in
[49:54] you look at those things you say man
[49:56] well that's what kind of what's
[49:57] happening to us we have to come to a
[49:58] position
[50:00] don't go out past the program of god
[50:01] come on
[50:02] brother brown said scrap heap of
[50:04] ministers
[50:05] stay in our place stay in our position
[50:07] stay in our revelation
[50:09] stay with what's going on now
[50:12] ever present god
[50:15] listen we know
[50:16] we know more about the future than the
[50:18] world does
[50:20] we know more about the future than the
[50:22] world knows you can listen to cnn
[50:25] 10 in
[50:27] whatever you want to listen to
[50:29] but we know more
[50:31] about what's going to happen the reality
[50:33] of what's going to happen than the world
[50:35] knows
[50:36] so that's why we shouldn't have the fear
[50:38] that we have when people start jumping
[50:40] up and talking about nuclear and all
[50:41] this other stuff
[50:43] just
[50:46] keep moving
[50:47] keep moving
[50:49] ephesians 1 verse 4 says according as he
[50:51] has chosen us now look
[50:53] in him before the foundation of the
[50:54] world that we should be holy and without
[50:55] blame before him in love having
[50:57] predestinated us into the adoption of
[50:59] children by jesus christ to himself
[51:02] according to his good pleasure of his
[51:04] will so that's us that's now
[51:08] he's chosen us in him that we can
[51:10] understand now not just the son of god
[51:12] but the son of man
[51:13] we understood why that man stood on
[51:15] earth and said what he did nobody else
[51:17] did
[51:19] even the apostles scratched their head a
[51:21] lot of times
[51:23] so now let's go to the next part let's
[51:25] kind of rush through this a little bit
[51:26] try to get done here in a minute
[51:29] to the word obedience that's what we
[51:30] were talking about the other day
[51:33] let's read the quote in 1963 from the
[51:36] token
[51:37] the token is a sign that the purchase
[51:39] has been made look
[51:41] made and been accepted
[51:45] made
[51:46] and been accepted
[51:50] you're born again
[51:52] and then you have to come on into
[51:53] adoption
[51:54] or being accepted
[51:57] or moving further along
[51:59] part of the growth part process listen
[52:01] our problem is we're not obedient
[52:04] our problem is we're not praying we're
[52:06] not letting him have total preeminence
[52:08] that's our issue
[52:10] and i'm talking about me not you
[52:13] you got to decide for yourself
[52:16] but that's why we're still here but what
[52:17] brother brown says look the token is a
[52:19] sign that the purchase has been made
[52:22] and been accepted
[52:25] jesus on the rebel jordan this is my
[52:27] beloved son and whom i'm pleased to
[52:28] dwell didn't say here ye him
[52:31] he had three and a half years of a
[52:32] ministry to grow
[52:34] the bible said he grew in grace and
[52:35] knowledge
[52:37] and was obedient
[52:41] he didn't bypass it he had to go through
[52:43] it just like me and you go through it
[52:46] but then then you come to mount
[52:47] transfiguration it's kind of funny that
[52:49] it had to happen on the mountain
[52:53] that jesus goes upon a mountain and god
[52:55] says this is my beloved son whom i'm
[52:56] pleased to dwell
[52:58] hear ye him
[53:00] it's time for you to listen to what he's
[53:02] going to say
[53:04] and brother brown said six months later
[53:06] he was dead
[53:07] but that's what he was heading toward he
[53:09] was heading toward calvary
[53:11] but obedience is part of your growth
[53:13] period
[53:15] if mordecai or morty as we know him
[53:18] if he's obedient
[53:21] what's the first thing we do when our
[53:23] kids are not obedient
[53:26] we punish them
[53:28] we take something away from what i'm
[53:30] sorry i'm sorry you don't whip them
[53:32] anymore
[53:36] that's our problem
[53:39] it is a problem you're
[53:40] right but anyway if you whip if y'all
[53:43] whip them like we got whipped back when
[53:45] we was younger y'all be in jail
[53:51] we used to get beat with with leather
[53:53] straps
[53:55] brother and sister god bless you amen i
[53:58] got whipped one time by principal and he
[54:00] happened to know
[54:02] the local barber
[54:05] and that long
[54:07] piece of strap that hung down from the
[54:09] barber's chair that he sharpened his um
[54:12] blade with
[54:15] it met flesh one day
[54:18] but i'll never forget it
[54:21] i may not have remembered exactly what i
[54:22] did but i'll never forget that weapon
[54:26] because buddy that leather strap was
[54:27] this wide and heavy and when he went
[54:29] back
[54:30] he didn't just go okay johnny
[54:34] no it was the full force
[54:37] of a principal that was probably my size
[54:39] at the time
[54:41] and that's the way god is
[54:43] but he does it with nail scarred hands
[54:45] but he does give you a whipping
[54:47] because we are not we're disobedient
[54:51] and that's what we got to work on now
[54:52] look now you can't get the token from
[54:55] the railroad as brother dale's always
[54:57] said
[55:00] you can't go and get a ticket to the
[55:02] radios to the i mean to the to the bus
[55:04] station
[55:05] and then go down to atlanta to get on an
[55:07] airplane
[55:09] wrong position
[55:11] wrong revelation
[55:13] it's going to be revealed to you all
[55:14] right when you get down to the airplanes
[55:16] out to the hearts field and you hand
[55:18] them a ticket for um
[55:20] for the thing that goes by here what is
[55:22] that amtrak
[55:24] they're gonna look at you like you're
[55:26] crazy because you probably are
[55:29] if you went down there with a ticket to
[55:31] the
[55:32] what it wrong place wrong time
[55:34] wrong position
[55:36] you've got the wrong revelation
[55:38] but now the person that buys the ticket
[55:40] and says oh i got to be on the train at
[55:42] 7 45. you know what they go to the train
[55:44] station
[55:46] that's the same way with me and you now
[55:47] you can't get the token from the
[55:48] railroad fair until you pay the price
[55:50] and the only way you're going to pay the
[55:52] price is pay it
[55:54] that's right believe it except that full
[55:56] obedience to the whole word of god
[55:59] will entitle you to the token
[56:01] full obedience
[56:03] not the part of it as far as your
[56:05] denomination goes
[56:06] but all of it
[56:08] full obedience to the word which is
[56:10] christ brings you
[56:12] into christ let's continue on
[56:15] full complete obedience scroll down down
[56:18] a little bit further
[56:19] full complete obedience puts you and the
[56:21] word one
[56:23] the word was made flesh
[56:26] that's you
[56:28] we know what happened 2000 years ago but
[56:30] that happened 2000 years ago so he could
[56:31] do it again
[56:33] and me and you you believe it every bit
[56:35] and all of it's in you
[56:37] and you watch it working
[56:39] through you
[56:40] all right let's continue on
[56:43] to the next quotes which is questions
[56:44] and answers
[56:45] or read a few quotes here and then we'll
[56:47] then we'll stop for a little while
[56:52] we must look at stature and growth
[56:53] development so let's go to questions and
[56:55] answers 1964.
[56:58] and let's look at this and this is
[56:59] another shocker that that we we know
[57:01] that
[57:03] let me kind of background for the for
[57:04] the for the people that haven't been
[57:05] here in a while and the new ones
[57:07] you we come to brother brown's message
[57:10] started out in the 40s 47
[57:14] and he started a work of what
[57:16] restoration
[57:18] everybody okay with that
[57:20] restoring i said restoring the church
[57:22] we're starting the order back restoring
[57:23] worship back he you know he smacked the
[57:26] pentecostals on the wrist and said look
[57:27] speaking in tongues is okay but this is
[57:29] how you do it
[57:31] gifts of this this is how you do it he
[57:33] was putting the church in order and he
[57:34] brought the people back to
[57:37] the faith of the pentecostal fathers
[57:39] back in the first church age everybody
[57:41] with me
[57:42] all right
[57:43] then he's got to take these babylon
[57:45] pentecostal babies that he's got in his
[57:47] congregation
[57:50] and he's trying to make him mature
[57:52] he's good he's going to feed him a
[57:54] little more meat instead of
[57:56] the milk that he's been feeding them
[57:58] everybody okay with that
[58:00] and that's when we get to the seals
[58:02] where where the prophet of god
[58:04] that is the headstone message of that
[58:07] prophet
[58:08] remember the messenger of malachi 4 is
[58:09] to do two things
[58:11] this is in the church age book
[58:13] what number one fulfill malachi 4
[58:17] right
[58:19] hearts of the children back to the
[58:20] fathers all right and then number two
[58:24] according to revelation 10 7 he's to
[58:26] bring the seals open the seals and open
[58:29] up the thunders
[58:31] that will literally turn us back what
[58:33] it's going to literally turn this thing
[58:35] back
[58:36] they didn't nobody get a body change in
[58:38] that first part of brother adam's
[58:39] ministry
[58:42] but in the second part of his ministry
[58:43] today we're looking at a body change
[58:47] we're looking at what we're going to
[58:48] read in probably another month now will
[58:50] be to wit the redemption of our body
[58:53] romans 8.
[58:55] but we got to get to this part first we
[58:56] got to get to the everybody wants to get
[58:58] to that part
[59:00] everybody wants to go from kindergarten
[59:02] to teaching in college
[59:04] in 15 minutes or less
[59:14] not knowing that they got to go through
[59:16] school
[59:17] they gotta learn their abcs
[59:20] what it's the same way in god i told you
[59:22] a long time when we started this series
[59:24] look at your life look at life
[59:27] and that's how god deals with you
[59:28] there's no other way he can deal with
[59:29] you except how you can understand
[59:33] i can't understand brother donnie he
[59:34] lived a different life than i did but
[59:36] god did because god was there with him
[59:37] and god knows how to handle brother
[59:38] donnie better than i know how to handle
[59:40] him amen
[59:42] so let god do it
[59:44] let him take us up that listen he's
[59:46] gonna have to pull us up that statue of
[59:47] a perfect man
[59:50] he's not gonna push us
[59:53] like i said last sunday if you ever
[59:54] tried to push a rope
[59:56] it will not go
[59:58] where you want it to go
[1:00:00] you push a rope and it'll go wherever it
[1:00:01] wants to but you pull it and it'll go
[1:00:03] where you want it to go
[1:00:04] so he's pulling us up that statue of a
[1:00:06] perfect man
[1:00:08] but look at his questions and answers
[1:00:09] 1964
[1:00:11] they asked him said brother adam are you
[1:00:12] the son of man that's what the question
[1:00:14] is i didn't put it on there save time
[1:00:16] but he says i am not he
[1:00:19] now what did i tell y'all a long time
[1:00:21] ago when we first started this series
[1:00:23] the characteristics of the son of man
[1:00:24] the son of man is he was virgin born
[1:00:28] that knocks everybody else out
[1:00:32] every prophet that ever coming in in the
[1:00:34] whole bible we're all born from sex
[1:00:37] brother around him included
[1:00:38] so he can't be the son of man there's
[1:00:40] only one the son of man and that's the
[1:00:42] lord jesus christ that was born
[1:00:44] without sex
[1:00:46] virgin born okay so let's knock that out
[1:00:48] there's not another man then that's the
[1:00:50] son of man
[1:00:51] but now collectively
[1:00:53] the bride in the last time end time it's
[1:00:55] supposed to be the son of man according
[1:00:57] to what brother brown said
[1:00:59] why because it's god in human flesh
[1:01:00] again
[1:01:01] back in a group of people not in just
[1:01:03] one man
[1:01:04] so brother adam was right he said i am a
[1:01:06] son of man
[1:01:08] revealing the son of man
[1:01:10] and that was that's what his real
[1:01:12] message was
[1:01:15] now we're not for our visitors we're not
[1:01:17] the group of people that kicks out 47 to
[1:01:20] 63 and says well he didn't know what
[1:01:21] he's talking about we're just going to
[1:01:22] take no 47-63
[1:01:26] if you just jump up the rung of the
[1:01:27] ladder to 63 to see you won't understand
[1:01:29] what he's talking about
[1:01:31] that's going from kindergarten
[1:01:35] to being a tenured
[1:01:37] college teacher
[1:01:39] in 15 minutes or less
[1:01:42] that's not the way it is
[1:01:44] we take the whole message
[1:01:46] i get seed in 47 and i get seed in 65.
[1:01:50] amen
[1:01:52] and i don't differentiate because god
[1:01:54] will take you to where you need to go
[1:01:55] amen
[1:01:56] but he said look now watch he said i'm
[1:01:58] not he i'm his servant look and the
[1:02:01] pillar of fire is not he
[1:02:04] now you would think but now listen
[1:02:07] the characteristics of the son of man
[1:02:09] though is is that is god
[1:02:12] in human flesh
[1:02:16] the pillar of fire that stood between
[1:02:17] brother branham and all those people
[1:02:19] that he prayed for and discerned for the
[1:02:20] pill of fire they used to see all the
[1:02:22] time if that's not the son of man
[1:02:26] because it's not god in human flesh
[1:02:30] that was a dispensation folks
[1:02:34] now listen that pillar of fire
[1:02:36] is inside of me and you now
[1:02:40] that same anointing
[1:02:41] now not the prophet part not to and
[1:02:43] listen we talk about discernment
[1:02:47] just looking at y'all's face i can
[1:02:48] deserve what you're thinking
[1:02:50] i don't need to get into your brain
[1:02:59] we're not getting anywhere
[1:03:03] but there was a dispensation where the
[1:03:04] prophet of god stood and discerned
[1:03:06] people out
[1:03:07] that was a dispensation to get the
[1:03:09] people to what what did he say that was
[1:03:11] he'd say that was the message
[1:03:14] he said that was debate on the hook
[1:03:17] what is the hook the hook was the
[1:03:18] message debate was the signs and wonders
[1:03:21] but it was supposed to turn to people to
[1:03:24] get them to listen to this message
[1:03:27] some did some
[1:03:28] didn't happening now
[1:03:32] i mean it's really it's nice to to uh i
[1:03:35] think they put out a tape not too well
[1:03:37] several years ago of just brother
[1:03:39] brown's prayer line
[1:03:40] and that's okay
[1:03:42] but that ain't going to change you
[1:03:45] that ain't going to take you to adoption
[1:03:51] i'm sorry it's not
[1:03:53] teaching is going to take you to
[1:03:54] adoption the preaching of the gospel by
[1:03:57] a human mortal man it's going to take
[1:03:59] you to adoption
[1:04:02] but the pillar of fire is not he it's in
[1:04:04] spirit form
[1:04:06] the son of man is not in spirit form
[1:04:08] jesus was not in spirit form when he was
[1:04:10] on the earth he was a human that had
[1:04:13] flesh like me and you
[1:04:15] he heard he groaned he ate he cried
[1:04:19] and he died
[1:04:22] but it's in spirit form which was upon
[1:04:24] the son upon the son of man
[1:04:26] and has come now
[1:04:28] to anoint
[1:04:30] sons of men
[1:04:33] to bring back a ministry just like he
[1:04:36] said it would be who's he god
[1:04:40] in order for the head and the rest of
[1:04:41] the body to connect together
[1:04:44] just like the pyramid look here's the
[1:04:46] quote i want to get to the headstone's
[1:04:48] yet to come
[1:04:52] what is the headstone
[1:04:54] it's the bride
[1:04:56] jesus is not going to be here in human
[1:04:58] flesh until the millennium right
[1:05:03] so where is he going to be if the
[1:05:04] headstone's yet to come and it's coming
[1:05:06] and it's here
[1:05:08] it's got to be in the bride
[1:05:10] it's got to be in sons and daughters of
[1:05:12] god
[1:05:14] and not a one-man show anymore
[1:05:18] the headstones yet to come
[1:05:21] let's go to galatians 4.
[1:05:27] i'm going to fly through this real quick
[1:05:28] because i'm going to have to because
[1:05:30] this afternoon i got to get to something
[1:05:32] so let's go to galatians 4 verse 1 now
[1:05:35] and i say that the heir as long as he's
[1:05:37] a child difference nothing from a
[1:05:38] servant all right
[1:05:40] you're born again that makes you a child
[1:05:42] of god
[1:05:44] everybody's saying man or old me one of
[1:05:46] the two
[1:05:47] okay
[1:05:48] the ones you that sleep can say it later
[1:05:51] then an heir as long as he's a child
[1:05:53] different nothing from a servant though
[1:05:55] he'd be lord of all what's he saying
[1:05:58] he is not going to take that boy that's
[1:06:00] just being born i can walk now they got
[1:06:03] they got the cameras on
[1:06:04] they're not gonna take this boy i'm not
[1:06:07] tethered anymore
[1:06:09] cause i got a camera right back under
[1:06:10] there y'all didn't see that one
[1:06:13] so we can run down this aisle further
[1:06:14] than we ever did
[1:06:17] i before
[1:06:17] get to the second poll
[1:06:20] i think brother joel got to the first
[1:06:21] poll i'm gonna get to the second poll
[1:06:23] one of these days
[1:06:24] i just lost my thought
[1:06:27] no i'm just kidding so when we come to
[1:06:29] it when we come to the new birth
[1:06:32] you become a son and daughter of god
[1:06:35] you can't get out of that if you're born
[1:06:37] again you can't get away from it all
[1:06:39] right
[1:06:40] god's not an indian giver
[1:06:43] right
[1:06:44] and i believe once they've always saved
[1:06:46] if you're really saved the first time
[1:06:48] amen
[1:06:50] but not that you get saved and never
[1:06:52] show up in church again
[1:06:54] it's a big difference there
[1:06:57] but look what did that say that says he
[1:06:59] differs nothing from a servant god's not
[1:07:02] going to take you though when you get
[1:07:03] born again and he's going to say here's
[1:07:05] a car keys
[1:07:07] just like we did with with mordecai
[1:07:09] and brother john's car keys that he
[1:07:11] about wrestled him down to get the car
[1:07:13] keys from
[1:07:16] but i mean that's true though you take
[1:07:18] mordecai as a newborn baby in christ
[1:07:21] he's got all the ability to i mean all
[1:07:22] the
[1:07:24] to drive
[1:07:25] eyesight ears
[1:07:27] hands feet
[1:07:29] but give him the keys to your car
[1:07:30] brother you got your car today right
[1:07:32] okay i don't want to embarrass you some
[1:07:34] people fall out when you call them out
[1:07:37] but there's a little boy back there nine
[1:07:38] years old can you give him your car keys
[1:07:39] let him drive you home
[1:07:42] that's the same way with god
[1:07:44] and i was and and literally if his
[1:07:47] daddy's sitting beside of him back there
[1:07:50] he's your son right
[1:07:51] he's not somebody else's son
[1:07:55] listen god loves you to be a son
[1:07:57] he loves you to be a child
[1:07:59] but he don't love you to stay a child
[1:08:02] i love my kids they're
[1:08:04] 30
[1:08:06] eight
[1:08:07] oh
[1:08:09] and my baby's 35.
[1:08:11] well she still lives at home but anyway
[1:08:14] um
[1:08:15] that's not normal
[1:08:20] i shouldn't have went there
[1:08:24] but you think about though how you feel
[1:08:28] think about how i feel
[1:08:30] but think about
[1:08:32] pray for me but think about though god
[1:08:36] having a child
[1:08:39] and for 35 years
[1:08:42] you stay in the same place
[1:08:48] think about it
[1:08:50] now
[1:08:51] there's no way i can do it i'm glad
[1:08:53] hannah's not here i'm there's no way
[1:08:55] i'll do away with my daughter she's my
[1:08:56] daughter
[1:08:57] regardless
[1:08:59] she's got my blood and my wife's blood
[1:09:01] flowing through her veins
[1:09:03] right
[1:09:05] same way with god
[1:09:08] you're just
[1:09:09] as eternal
[1:09:11] as god is when you become a son and
[1:09:13] daughter of god
[1:09:15] but in this end time there's a
[1:09:17] requirement that we grow up
[1:09:19] and not stay
[1:09:21] at home for 35 years
[1:09:24] no
[1:09:25] grow up have a family
[1:09:28] get a job
[1:09:31] get out
[1:09:35] remember what i said i hope sister
[1:09:36] gayle's watching together brother dick
[1:09:37] our old song leader he's passed on now
[1:09:40] but he told me he said i tell my kids
[1:09:43] he said remember two
[1:09:46] two numbers 18 and 30.
[1:09:49] when you're 18 years old you got 30 days
[1:09:51] to get out of my house
[1:09:55] yeah bro boyd said again glory
[1:09:58] but i'm gonna tell you something though
[1:09:59] brother dick's got three of the best
[1:10:00] kids i've ever seen in my life
[1:10:03] that you know what though they made it
[1:10:05] on their own
[1:10:06] now listen god's gonna not god's not
[1:10:08] gonna throw you out there and let you
[1:10:10] make it on your own
[1:10:12] at least he's the father that's gonna be
[1:10:13] with you all the time
[1:10:15] so that's what's going to happen but now
[1:10:16] when he started when this child started
[1:10:19] in this kingdom he was put with the
[1:10:21] servants
[1:10:25] though he be lord of all
[1:10:27] though daddy knows that if he does
[1:10:29] everything perfect and everything right
[1:10:31] he's going to get that kingdom one day
[1:10:33] but he don't give him the kingdom at the
[1:10:35] time
[1:10:37] same way with god
[1:10:38] we're put under tutors and governors
[1:10:40] until the time appointed of the father
[1:10:47] even so we when we were children
[1:10:50] were in bondage under the elements of
[1:10:52] the world but when the fullness of time
[1:10:54] was come
[1:10:55] now
[1:10:56] god sent forth his son made of a woman
[1:10:58] made under the law we know that was
[1:10:59] jesus christ
[1:11:01] to redeem them that were under the law
[1:11:02] that we might receive the adoption of
[1:11:05] sons
[1:11:06] and because you are sons
[1:11:08] god has sent forth the spirit of his son
[1:11:11] into your heart crying daddy daddy or
[1:11:14] abba father father father wherefore they
[1:11:16] are no more a servant but a son all
[1:11:18] right i become a son now
[1:11:21] he's separating me a little bit from the
[1:11:23] world
[1:11:25] because he's teaching me things
[1:11:27] i've come to a position
[1:11:29] since then an heir of god
[1:11:31] through christ
[1:11:33] let's read these couple of quotes and
[1:11:34] then we'll we're going to have to stop
[1:11:35] because i've got another
[1:11:37] hour left here
[1:11:39] and we have church at two o'clock so we
[1:11:40] can't do that
[1:11:41] for those of you that travel
[1:11:44] we do that so let's read the next one
[1:11:48] and then we'll set the basis for this
[1:11:50] afternoon
[1:11:53] this is the prophet of god 1954. he says
[1:11:56] i just love teaching
[1:11:58] oh my i think it's wonderful it gives
[1:11:59] look
[1:12:00] the basis and settles the church
[1:12:03] why wouldn't you want to be in a church
[1:12:05] that was settled
[1:12:08] okay i've been in some that weren't
[1:12:12] they have good teaching
[1:12:15] because what brother brown said look
[1:12:17] number six adoption series now preaching
[1:12:19] usually catches the center we listen we
[1:12:22] believe in a five-fold ministry there's
[1:12:23] no doubt you all know we believe in the
[1:12:25] five-fold ministry we have brothers come
[1:12:27] in that fulfill the five-fold ministry
[1:12:29] all right
[1:12:30] now preaching usually catches the sinner
[1:12:32] brings him under conviction or
[1:12:33] condemnation
[1:12:35] by the word but
[1:12:38] but
[1:12:39] teaching places a man positionally what
[1:12:42] he is now that's what our mandate is
[1:12:44] positionally place us
[1:12:47] and we can never rightly be able to have
[1:12:49] faith
[1:12:51] until positionally we know where we are
[1:12:54] or what we are or where we're supposed
[1:12:56] to be
[1:13:02] let's skip that next quote read this
[1:13:04] other one magicians come on
[1:13:06] we'll get to the three stages of
[1:13:07] adoption this afternoon
[1:13:09] but let's read this quote number eight
[1:13:12] which is the next one after seven keep
[1:13:14] going it's kind of long number eight all
[1:13:15] right
[1:13:17] now what is adoption
[1:13:20] now let me get this now
[1:13:22] i don't know whether i won't have time
[1:13:23] to get through this but i'll hit it then
[1:13:25] if there's a question you can ask me a
[1:13:27] little later on something in the message
[1:13:28] sometimes listen
[1:13:30] your adoption is not your birth
[1:13:35] your adoption is not your birth
[1:13:38] your adoption is your placing and that's
[1:13:40] what we're going to talk about this
[1:13:40] afternoon placing how how that joshua
[1:13:43] placed the people in the promised land
[1:13:46] how he placed all those children of
[1:13:47] israel as we were talking about last
[1:13:49] night
[1:13:49] what a wonderful analogy that there was
[1:13:51] two tribes and a half tribe state on
[1:13:53] this side
[1:13:54] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:13:56] the holy ghost and in those three ages
[1:13:59] luther wesley and pentecost there was no
[1:14:01] way they could come to adoption
[1:14:06] but there was a half tribe of manasseh
[1:14:08] that he went on over into the promised
[1:14:10] land
[1:14:11] now what is the promised land we know
[1:14:12] it's the holy ghost but
[1:14:14] it's also where they were placed
[1:14:17] and they're placing we were talking
[1:14:18] about this last night you know how they
[1:14:20] got placed
[1:14:22] their mothers
[1:14:25] at their
[1:14:26] birth screamed out their name and
[1:14:30] brother brown said that's where they
[1:14:31] were positionally placed i asked him
[1:14:33] last night i said okay
[1:14:35] your mama
[1:14:37] not your natural mama
[1:14:38] your spiritual mother
[1:14:44] when she gave birth to you
[1:14:47] she placed you
[1:14:49] you just don't realize it yet
[1:14:53] that's what happened in the natural but
[1:14:55] also what happened in the spiritual when
[1:14:56] you get born again there's replacing but
[1:14:58] maybe we haven't realized maybe it takes
[1:15:00] some good teaching or maybe it takes
[1:15:01] some good preaching to bring that out
[1:15:03] and show you not worry maybe not even
[1:15:04] where you're going to be but where you
[1:15:06] are how many times have you looked at
[1:15:07] that
[1:15:09] dream that brother branham had about
[1:15:11] brother ed biskell
[1:15:13] remember the green checking shirt
[1:15:15] now brother biscuit told us personally
[1:15:17] he said i was in that vision for hours
[1:15:21] hours
[1:15:22] before i looked down and realized that i
[1:15:24] had on the shirt that the vision was
[1:15:28] now what about me and you
[1:15:30] we've been in this vision a long time
[1:15:33] let's come to a realization that we've
[1:15:35] had that green checky shirt on the whole
[1:15:36] time
[1:15:38] let's read the adoption series right
[1:15:40] here real quick your adoption is not
[1:15:41] your birth
[1:15:42] your adoption is your placing when you
[1:15:44] were born again john 1 17 i believe when
[1:15:47] we're born of the spirit of god we are
[1:15:49] the sons of gods everybody got that say
[1:15:51] amen but we were predestinated
[1:15:55] now here's what i'm trying to get you to
[1:15:57] for the sons of the last day
[1:16:00] we were predestinated unto
[1:16:04] adoption now now here we are listen this
[1:16:07] will hurt pentecostal a little bit
[1:16:10] this will hurt people in the message
[1:16:11] that stayed pentecostal a little bit
[1:16:13] sorry
[1:16:14] they say i got born again praise the
[1:16:16] lord god the holy ghost brother brown
[1:16:17] said fine
[1:16:19] i'm not doubting that he said
[1:16:23] you're a child of god that's right but
[1:16:25] yet
[1:16:26] that ain't what i'm talking about thank
[1:16:27] god for a southern prophet that can say
[1:16:29] ain't
[1:16:32] but yet that ain't what i'm talking
[1:16:33] about
[1:16:35] see you were predestinated unto adoption
[1:16:37] adoption is placing
[1:16:39] a son
[1:16:41] not the birth
[1:16:43] but the placing
[1:16:44] and he's given us the ability to be
[1:16:46] placed
[1:16:48] in the end time
[1:16:50] we heard
[1:16:53] we heard the end time message
[1:16:56] we have now become the end time message
[1:16:59] there is no other message besides this
[1:17:01] message
[1:17:03] and we're a part of it
[1:17:05] so what does it call our call is for
[1:17:07] adoption let's stand our feet
[1:17:09] that's our call not another one
[1:17:13] it's our mandate to grow up in god
[1:17:17] and come to full adoption
[1:17:19] where our name is as good on the
[1:17:20] checkbook
[1:17:22] as
[1:17:23] the fathers
[1:17:25] i thank god for a prophet that told us
[1:17:28] he said now when you first get born
[1:17:29] again he said
[1:17:30] god signs the check
[1:17:33] whatever you need you tell god what you
[1:17:34] need he signs the check because you know
[1:17:36] what
[1:17:37] if it ain't right he ain't going to sign
[1:17:39] a check
[1:17:41] i've told you how many times god's nose
[1:17:43] are the best guesses you ever get
[1:17:45] if god tells you no
[1:17:47] you better believe that there's
[1:17:48] something going to happen in your life
[1:17:50] that's going to go wrong and god's
[1:17:52] already seen it because he's infinite
[1:17:55] so his know is the best yes you'll ever
[1:17:56] get but he'll come to a time where he'll
[1:17:59] say that's my boy
[1:18:02] that's my son that's my daughter they're
[1:18:04] acting right
[1:18:05] they've come to a place where now i can
[1:18:07] give them gifts in the body
[1:18:09] i can give them discernment and gifts of
[1:18:12] healing and all these other gifts
[1:18:15] and then one day he's going to give us a
[1:18:17] gift
[1:18:19] i'll speak in the word
[1:18:22] and the dead is going to come out of the
[1:18:23] ground
[1:18:25] all our loved ones that have gone before
[1:18:27] they're waiting on me and you

[1:18:31] fullness into me and you
