[14:31] your communication bae a name a for
[14:35] whatsoever is more than these cometh
[14:37] from the coming of evil you have heard
[14:40] that it hath been said an eye for an eye
[14:42] a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you
[14:44] that you resist not that ye resist not
[14:48] evil but what whosoever shall smite thee
[14:51] on thy right cheek turn to him the other
[14:54] also and if any man will sue the aetna
[14:58] law and take away thy coat let him have
[15:01] that bloke also and whosoever shall
[15:04] compel thee tis warm I'll go with him 20
[15:06] give to him that asketh thee and of him
[15:10] that would bar of the tourney now turn
[15:14] not down away you have heard that it
[15:17] hath been said thou shalt love thy
[15:20] neighbor and hate thine enemies never
[15:22] remember the text of what we started off
[15:25] using this on to show in our natural
[15:28] lives you know he was telling her
[15:30] how it should be we should be this way
[15:33] we should be that way but then it's this
[15:35] is the way God doesn't you have heard
[15:38] that it hath been said thou shalt love
[15:40] thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I
[15:43] say unto you love your enemies bless
[15:45] them that curse you and do good to them
[15:47] that hate you and pray for them which
[15:48] despitefully use you and persecute not
[15:51] persecute that persecute you that you
[15:54] may be the children of your father which
[15:56] is in heaven where he maketh the Sun to
[15:58] rise on the evil and on the good and
[16:01] sendeth rain on the just and on the
[16:03] unjust for if you love them which love
[16:06] you what reward have you do not even the
[16:09] publicans the same and if you salute
[16:11] your brethren only what do you do eat
[16:14] more than others do not even the public
[16:17] and so be therefore perfect even as your
[16:20] father which is in heaven is perfect now
[16:23] let's go back to the job we'll get
[16:27] through the scripture in a little bit
[16:29] joke 23 begin reading about the 8th
[16:34] verse read the whole chapter and all
[16:36] this is job's answer back to his three
[16:39] companions buddies as to him and
[16:42] condemning him for being a secret center
[16:44] and everything you know and even one of
[16:47] them said to it you know said you know
[16:49] if you were you think you're perfect but
[16:53] if you're perfect this wouldn't happen
[16:55] to know see there was condemning him
[16:58] because he was you know was in bad shape
[16:59] you know sitting on a seat with all of
[17:02] his friends lost this thing with
[17:03] everything else you know but he says
[17:06] behold I go forward but he is not there
[17:10] and backward but I cannot receive him on
[17:16] the left hand where he's at work but God
[17:20] that I cannot behold him he hides
[17:23] himself on the right hand that I cannot
[17:26] see him listen but in no other way that
[17:30] I take
[17:31] we have tried me I shall come forth as
[17:34] gold my foot have held his steps and
[17:40] this is eventually what I've done what
[17:43] he told me to do all right I don't get
[17:45] back to that scripture in the expand on
[17:47] that remember that's what he said my
[17:49] foot have held his steps his way how I
[17:53] kept and not declined neither have I
[17:57] gone back from the commandment of his
[18:00] lips I have a stain the words of his
[18:03] mouth more than my necessary food you
[18:08] may be seated or that is blessing to the
[18:10] reading of the word this is a thousand
[18:13] percent my brother Ernie going away but
[18:15] it's talking about kind of them setting
[18:19] up a monetary system worldwide systems
[18:23] at all he'll just make you a copy of it
[18:26] you know it's not that it's going to put
[18:29] us into rapture it's the revealed Word
[18:32] and if we do know about those things
[18:34] also all right now I told you we were
[18:39] going to take a little talk for just a
[18:41] few services on jesus said be therefore
[18:44] perfect even as your father in heaven is
[18:48] perfect we see mankind just like as I
[18:52] said about the people with job jokes
[18:55] that I've offered what God said I've
[19:00] done what the commandments from his lips
[19:02] has declared so I stand on that ground
[19:08] another work I stand here before you
[19:11] condemned by his buddies you know and
[19:16] saying he was a secret Center how could
[19:19] you be perfect job because look what's
[19:21] happening to you all right now
[19:27] could it be that we could think that
[19:30] away too we see sickness come on
[19:32] somebody well it must have been that
[19:35] must mean something done wrong even
[19:40] sometimes when Seaton's comes with us we
[19:47] question was it something we've done
[19:50] wrong that's fine you know that's fine
[19:53] to do that couldn't make ourself right
[19:55] but as far as what's to anyone else that
[19:59] is none of my business you know some
[20:03] houses somebody else you know that's
[20:06] none of my business and that's what
[20:07] preachers will do though they'll use
[20:09] that as a scare tactic to try to get
[20:11] control and they'll say look what's
[20:14] happened to you and look what's going to
[20:16] happen to you well you know after about
[20:21] 40 years driving down the road you
[20:24] probably bound to have a wreck living
[20:27] person come let's see that God's wrath
[20:31] against you well then they've done had
[20:33] 10 in the 40 years that you've been
[20:35] driving but it's never for them yeah me
[20:40] that's why Joe could sit back to his
[20:42] condemn verse said you got a problem you
[20:47] know you having any trouble truck so
[20:48] ever well you uh maybe it's your problem
[20:53] maybe you've done something wrong but he
[20:55] didn't take that approach he just made
[20:57] it stately as I said and this would be
[21:00] the beautiful perfect number two but in
[21:03] this meat jobs answer I've done what God
[21:07] said dude no that's not what Cain said
[21:14] when he said I've offered the offer and
[21:16] you take it or leave it come in penning
[21:19] it was the wrong offering right right
[21:22] that's right and he made the right one
[21:25] they would have been in trouble right
[21:27] God would it took his offering
[21:30] yeah no problem let's see job said I've
[21:34] Alfred it I've done what God told me to
[21:36] do so I have to stand on what God says
[21:41] all right now that's what I'm trying to
[21:43] get you an odyssey that we've actually
[21:47] we've got to come to a place within our
[21:49] sales that's right to were that we can
[21:54] get to the word and just say the word
[21:56] says it and I believe right so I played
[21:58] the Brooklyn I think the thing that
[22:01] Bible say well mine you can get down an
[22:05] argue points about it you know to see
[22:08] but that's still a go change nobody and
[22:11] you know I set in that early yesterday
[22:13] and I took money and the morning wants
[22:16] the entitlement said I m'dear staying
[22:18] with a while I'm just reading it reading
[22:20] The Anointed once the end time and how
[22:21] that was actually the Spirit of God you
[22:24] know on the people but yet that they
[22:27] took their a word that was not God's
[22:29] work and you know and they wound up
[22:33] being what they were and you know if I
[22:35] was said that God would then turn them
[22:37] over to a strong delusion to leave a
[22:40] line be damned well well you know I got
[22:44] to thinking about it they kind of
[22:45] changed my thoughts on something it
[22:48] won't change me preaching against wrong
[22:50] with people but it's changed my thoughts
[22:53] about you making it right because they
[22:58] go off into a room and God has even
[23:02] blessed them yep because that's you know
[23:07] it won't try run see they can happen you
[23:11] don't want no I can't hit me in one
[23:13] night hey me if I'm lost if I'm an
[23:17] antichrist I'm like what brother L said
[23:21] i wanna be the best convey a man i think
[23:23] that's right because i can't help it I'm
[23:27] just what I am so they don't have to
[23:29] stand
[23:30] that roundabout way Lord you know maybe
[23:32] I'll try to get away from things you
[23:34] know because people can't help it but
[23:37] those who want to hear can hear know if
[23:41] you have the baptism with all we go so
[23:42] you will hear all right that's right let
[23:45] you don't you'll have your own idea and
[23:47] you'd be annoying didn't go out and have
[23:49] a good time but you know it's all right
[23:51] but now listen what was we trying to
[23:55] make as a background on to this to
[23:59] probably get to a place to see what
[24:02] Jesus was saying when he said be
[24:04] therefore perfect even as your father in
[24:07] heaven is perfect when all mankind has
[24:11] either tried to deny that perfection or
[24:15] say you know nobody can be perfect huh
[24:20] are they try to explain that away you
[24:25] know and they'll say well if that
[24:27] incident there a Matthew that it's
[24:31] saying complete a full age and it does
[24:37] that's the definition from the word
[24:39] perfect north in Matthew 5 all right but
[24:43] then I hold on a minute you might find a
[24:45] definition in the Old Testament that's
[24:48] identical for the word perfect and it
[24:53] might be a surprise okay so we just
[24:55] rolled onto the point but what I'm
[24:59] trying to get me in you to see is if God
[25:02] says it now this is all I'm trying to
[25:05] preach all right don't you get this with
[25:07] if everybody get it right now doing this
[25:09] we just quit go home because this is my
[25:13] whole point if God says it run around
[25:18] and said it was a requirement
[25:21] right he said in God required us to be
[25:25] perfect and he said he had to make away
[25:31] and says he has made away all right now
[25:36] I'm trying to go back go to the Old
[25:39] Testament with it to talk about those
[25:43] back there the word that God would call
[25:46] them perfect right see then you come up
[25:50] several but when that weapon no no they
[25:52] can't be they can't be perfect cuz they
[25:54] would mourn again when I agree we they
[25:56] would but let's just go through the
[26:01] scripture think of that he the atonement
[26:08] of the natural animal sure now had to be
[26:13] made it was required and it was done Joe
[26:18] had offered the atonement he even
[26:22] offered the atonement for his children
[26:24] alright then God saved them because of
[26:28] his atonement he lost seven of them but
[26:32] he got seven more back when he got those
[26:34] seven and glory now that's the way run
[26:36] around this mind it alright so now just
[26:41] bear with me see under the natural
[26:45] atonement of an animal God covered their
[26:54] sin alright now you look to the red at
[26:58] red and what do you see alright so if
[27:02] God covered their sin now know it pushed
[27:05] it up reach to the other man it pushed
[27:07] it to Calvary no Jesus Christ had to die
[27:10] for all thin lure line
[27:12] huh but also know that ever atonement
[27:16] that was made was speaking of Christ
[27:19] right that's why you agree each one was
[27:23] so then what he was doing back there the
[27:26] blood of bulls and goats couldn't get
[27:28] into the heart of man to be able to give
[27:31] him eternal life as a new earth but it
[27:35] could cover him in his natural doings
[27:38] until he could stand before God he's in
[27:47] that animal atonement God said to make
[27:52] it in the Dean and then as they made it
[27:57] with an honest and sincere heart I know
[28:00] I told you I don't believe everybody
[28:01] they walked up there with the blood of
[28:03] the Bulls and the goats and you know
[28:05] it's forgiving I don't I just um not
[28:09] that far off I don't believe it the doc
[28:12] you just throw all of them I know it's a
[28:14] nation when they offered the blood of
[28:17] bulls and go you know they need to tone
[28:19] the nation but that was naturally to
[28:22] keep them from being destroyed but if
[28:26] you didn't have faith in your atonement
[28:28] but around said you had to believe these
[28:31] by laying your hands upon that animal
[28:34] that God transmitted your sins to that
[28:37] animal Joe is faith right you know
[28:41] believe in God you wouldn't just well
[28:43] here yeah blame I'm going back do it
[28:45] again no I'm God's not done I don't
[28:49] think he wants us to be that way arnott
[28:53] but you remember what we got in to knit
[28:57] talking about the atonement that Moses
[29:01] there in Exodus 32 he said when the
[29:09] children of Israel had sinned with the
[29:10] golden k he said I thought before God
[29:14] and said pre adventure
[29:20] I shall make an atonement well now go
[29:25] through your Bible to find out where he
[29:26] offered an animal he didn't offer an
[29:32] animal you went before God and play the
[29:35] case and said God if you destroy them
[29:37] destroy me all right let a random puts
[29:44] the two scriptures together to work did
[29:46] he comes out of them saying yo you
[29:51] brought him out you take take them in
[29:53] sand that's what will be sat out here
[29:54] about you but said that's you know and
[29:58] so he reminded God that God had told him
[30:03] that he would take the people to the
[30:05] land that's right he took him up to the
[30:08] promised land he couldn't take them in
[30:09] not because of their but because he over
[30:13] the other much smack a rock all right
[30:15] but still he went to the lane orna now
[30:20] what its home that then was being made
[30:22] was Moses is worth reminding god of his
[30:26] word hey the road said I couldn't
[30:30] understand that until I seen that it was
[30:33] Christ and Moses alright see Christ me
[30:39] how to lead the case right right now
[30:44] they had to make the covering right but
[30:50] the atonement was made to the voice of a
[30:53] man we ended up talking about how that
[30:59] we needed the grace of marriage and
[31:01] divorce and then we've got to believe
[31:05] that God told man the gonna tell us
[31:10] right the way to be free we've got to
[31:14] believe that so then has it been my
[31:18] point was then was this like name was
[31:21] God looking at the atonement her was he
[31:23] were reminded of his word which one was
[31:30] it
[31:31] when I asked you the question I said who
[31:34] took care of Adam and Eve in the time
[31:37] that was between their sin and the time
[31:39] God made the atonement who took care of
[31:44] them the word had already said that he
[31:47] was a lamb slain before the foundation
[31:49] of the world so God couldn't kill at him
[31:52] and he couldn't guilty right the because
[31:56] that word had already been spoken right
[31:59] now we can believe it that away see then
[32:05] we can see why it's all in the Bible I
[32:07] I'm speaking that God says we're perfect
[32:11] man but we try to figure it out we try
[32:18] to dissect words we try to to get an
[32:22] interpretation then we go into the Bible
[32:32] and we pick up like none of their doing
[32:36] this message we get to this minute but
[32:40] they say no it was perfect that that
[32:44] many was the only seat left then he was
[32:50] perfect he was the only true seed left
[32:55] and they try to preach the seed from
[32:57] that who we will read in a minute that
[33:00] the same definition for Noah that says
[33:05] he was perfect is the same definition
[33:09] that says Satan was perfect he was
[33:16] Creely so we're Satan the only see you
[33:22] know what i said i'll get dr. and the
[33:26] people in vain but i realize they can't
[33:28] have it and that going out that way
[33:31] won't convert one person probably unless
[33:34] it's somebody that's really got an
[33:35] honest and sincere heart
[33:37] then we'll think about hey this man just
[33:39] said something right but most won't all
[33:44] right but now think about it he covered
[33:48] their sin so much in the Old Testament
[33:54] until actually they could stand in the
[33:59] presence of God that's right now that's
[34:04] pretty perfect go once in and the
[34:07] presence of God right around said is
[34:09] automatic death so they're perfect hey
[34:15] why can't we bleed come on now get to it
[34:19] a few minutes if we can believe under
[34:20] the blood of bulls and goats the day was
[34:22] perfect but how much more should it be
[34:25] under the blood of Jesus Christ right
[34:28] what I'm trying to get you see it don't
[34:30] change there's still what God said my
[34:35] mom go you can't prove Jesus crap died
[34:41] you might claim to have a couple of
[34:44] drops of the blood but you can't prove
[34:49] so we're based on what some man say it
[34:53] that God said right right we know what
[34:58] we're only thing we got to do is get the
[35:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost that can
[35:02] divide the difference to whether the man
[35:04] was saying it of his own self
[35:06] presumptuously as the Bible says I was
[35:09] saying what God see that's all I'm
[35:13] trying to get us to see he's gonna be
[35:17] able to say what God said now this this
[35:19] message will go on well now so I would
[35:23] listen to the background please because
[35:27] it other things that will be involved as
[35:29] we go along all right you come out to
[35:33] see the day that we're living what's
[35:36] wrong with most people
[35:39] we said we believe the Bible I said when
[35:44] I was the bad news church i believe the
[35:45] Bible knock up on that I didn't believe
[35:49] now listen I didn't believe what I
[35:51] thought it said you know I mean I
[35:57] believed it didn't say it like it's a at
[35:59] night by understand man he didn't change
[36:02] the wording that's right right did you
[36:06] say saw that it didn't say what I
[36:07] thought it's all right right right right
[36:13] we know it said baptized father-son
[36:16] holding up
[36:22] you said what I said Jack with the
[36:24] letter that's not what to say that's
[36:29] right but then we don't go overboard see
[36:33] if throw it out because once you're
[36:34] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[36:36] Christ you are baptized in the father
[36:39] coming home right that's what I say it
[36:43] anyway when i baptize anybody you know
[36:46] to fulfill the Great Commission to
[36:49] baptize and name of the Father and of
[36:50] the Son and of the Holy Ghost I now
[36:52] baptize you in the name of the Lord
[36:53] Jesus Christ because it's the only way
[36:55] to me don't have it but it's getting to
[36:58] the point of believing it amen believing
[37:03] what God's saying amen if we believed it
[37:08] correctly then we would read there in
[37:11] Revelation we went into the 13 8 where
[37:16] the delay i'm stood slain before the
[37:18] foundation of the world right their
[37:20] names were written in the Lamb's Book of
[37:22] Life we believe that would not believe
[37:27] it as to the point to make us to work
[37:30] that we it need to be saved that's what
[37:35] I pickle does in this message they they
[37:40] think one always was a Christian always
[37:44] have eternal life well if you always
[37:46] that Jesus died money all right do you
[37:51] wonder why I keep saying something them
[37:53] go there quick to you one day day hey
[37:55] that can't be right all right what I'm
[37:59] trying to get me you to do is to believe
[38:02] if God said make a sacrifice then that
[38:10] sacrifice from a sincere heart would
[38:16] cover that individual
[38:19] so much until that individual should
[38:23] Murphy hi amen complete Alleluia
[38:39] see whether it be older New Testament we
[38:43] gotta believe look what God says is true
[38:49] mm-hmm but what we want is we want a man
[38:55] to say hmm hey right heaven I thought
[39:01] claiming they will accept it right now
[39:08] when I what was the children of Israel
[39:10] when God came down that literally were
[39:13] going to talk to every one of you know
[39:15] how priestly Moses had a burning bush
[39:18] got talk to it when he came out in the
[39:20] burning bush wherever is realized to
[39:22] stand before and glide would have spoke
[39:24] to every one of them what happened Moses
[39:30] you tell God it we can't stand it like
[39:33] this do you go up that can you find out
[39:39] what God wants us to know and will
[39:42] believe you and do everything you say
[39:47] the winning kamag told them the deleted
[39:52] did you do it if they did it was just
[39:57] for comfort Moses said I got to do it
[40:01] drivers go do it you were the same
[40:06] situation or attitude or our condition
[40:10] that Moses walked before God
[40:15] you see they said we lady Moreta says
[40:20] the hardest thing in the world to get
[40:22] one man to believe another yeah that's
[40:24] right right I'm have no problem is
[40:30] quoting him all right if you tell me
[40:35] something that I'll play strip I'm gonna
[40:36] tell blaze drew and I hope you'll do the
[40:40] same thing with me does they don't bleed
[40:46] but their sins were covered so much now
[40:53] you said when I wait a min Rodale they
[40:55] couldn't go behind the veil no because
[40:57] that's the way God ordained it but
[41:00] Aaron's no tell me erin was a sinner and
[41:07] went back there and come out alive come
[41:11] on you better think with me he had the
[41:17] fake blood for yourself first then for
[41:22] the people and they had a rope tied
[41:24] around the old boy just in case if he
[41:30] wasn't right he didn't matter if
[41:33] everybody else was right that's right he
[41:35] done the high priest he could stand
[41:42] before God
[41:46] how long can we preach on how Moses to
[41:49] do he went round before garland 40 days
[41:52] and 40 nights out in food and water come
[41:54] on right after a good long 40 day fast
[42:02] and coming out of our weakness could be
[42:04] he runs into a bunch of people making
[42:06] ago entire night when they give you a
[42:09] good feeling no you upped our asking God
[42:13] what he wants them to know they'd better
[42:15] dykes it around the cave you get what
[42:19] I'm saying the hot breeze could go
[42:22] before God and literally stand in the
[42:25] Holy of Holies there's a wonderful place
[42:31] until he forgot his his walking stick if
[42:34] we call it his rod right one time and
[42:38] went back and found out it bled in
[42:40] Boston wooden barrel almonds there in
[42:44] that presence but what God told Moses
[42:48] was the only thing that kept Aaron alive
[42:51] or any priests that went in there after
[42:54] word got to tell Aaron what to death
[42:58] right you told Moses what to die don't
[43:04] you think that if I gonna be back there
[43:06] brother Colley he would he was Moses and
[43:09] I was Aaron do you think I'd say no
[43:12] Moses are you sure have you forgot
[43:16] anything look me over good examine me
[43:22] ever phase that's good i want to make
[43:25] sure you know what i thought about the
[43:27] other day I thought and I know they ruin
[43:29] then we'll know that but still I thought
[43:33] you know Moses have a photographic
[43:35] memory that's the best answer I come up
[43:39] with you know what a photographic memory
[43:42] is if you can remember everything you've
[43:44] ever heard seen or whatever there's
[43:46] people vacuum to do that all right cuz
[43:49] God tells Moses a whole lot of things to
[43:51] do and he goes then he tells them what
[43:56] to do
[43:56] now we fix that marriage guard with 70
[44:00] say that again they'll make sure I get
[44:02] around jejejeje usually short means you
[44:05] do because his life was at stake now
[44:09] that's the Christ it was the same one
[44:11] that was back there telling God a better
[44:15] way of doing truck was the same process
[44:19] break of hoses memory exactly what the
[44:22] pen once he got away from that see this
[44:26] thing is not made on this haphazard
[44:28] that's right but it's bleeding man
[44:34] believing that God told that man and
[44:39] then that man told the people that's
[44:41] right you know the whole Bible based on
[44:44] that where I said that about their in
[44:48] Jesus went even is Satan you matthew
[44:51] twenty Matthew 5 you see what I say love
[44:56] your enemies me a man you see what I'm
[45:01] getting that see we might say or think
[45:06] that they were not made perfect by the
[45:08] blood on blood of bulls and goats but
[45:12] God said they were perfect because they
[45:15] were covered by the atonement right now
[45:20] get it right that blood of bulls and
[45:23] goats never gave them the humor come on
[45:28] we know better than that that came on
[45:30] the day of Pentecost they did not have
[45:34] the new birth the Old Testament but when
[45:37] God said they were perfect why can't I
[45:39] say they was perfect right instead of
[45:42] trying to figure out some way there's
[45:45] some kind of something could be let's go
[45:50] over to the jenison you start a little
[45:53] bit good see that's why I want you to
[45:58] think about people of this message
[46:02] preached that Noah was the only
[46:04] righteous see
[46:07] left big names all right only righteous
[46:16] seed that you was left the words coming
[46:22] from Adam the purity look to know what
[46:27] well it's that be right noise laugh the
[46:33] end would have been messed up as Noah's
[46:37] life was messed up all the noise kids
[46:40] would be messed up because they didn't
[46:43] hurt from their mother so what good
[46:45] would it do you try to preach some kind
[46:47] of a perfectly these preacher perfect
[46:50] God would you see their little Chinese
[46:56] people you think they gonna listen to me
[47:00] even though i would say listen in a
[47:03] minute we'll just use the same
[47:04] definition for noise we use it for Satan
[47:11] but you see people listen something like
[47:13] that I is just a smart naked all right a
[47:16] much more than I don't like to be called
[47:20] a deadlier smarts okay all right let's
[47:25] go to Genesis 6 verse 8 why are you
[47:31] getting there but Noah found grace in
[47:33] the eyes of the Lord these are the
[47:36] generations of no one know was a just
[47:38] man and perfect in his generations and
[47:43] Noah walked with God and no one the
[47:50] Bible said was perfect so now we've
[47:54] already got somebody in the Old
[47:55] Testament we quoted these last week but
[47:57] I wanted to get like me I want you to
[48:00] think about this time no one was perfect
[48:08] hmm
[48:11] that word perfect is 85 49 Strong's
[48:14] Concordance okay as ninety four times
[48:19] we're perfect using about it means
[48:24] complete it means whole wh 0 le you know
[48:29] whole means entire it means sound let's
[48:36] 0 UND sound it means innocent from know
[48:45] all of us completely with holy the
[48:48] entire you sally was if he's perfect one
[48:56] because he made the atonement right no
[49:04] matter if even got a drop yet how did I
[49:06] do it God said he was perfect drop over
[49:17] to Genesis 17 verse 1 now God said
[49:27] something can be done he's got to
[49:29] provide the way to do it in when Abram
[49:36] was 90 years old and nine the Lord
[49:39] appeared to Abram and said unto Him I am
[49:43] The Almighty God walk before me and be
[49:45] thou perfect well now if God told him if
[49:56] he would walk before him he'd be perfect
[50:02] will not it evidently the abilities
[50:10] there do you understand the abilities
[50:13] dire to be perfect or he could have said
[50:15] that
[50:19] I've got the same definition now have 85
[50:22] 49 which means complete cold and dark
[50:24] slammed is all right let's go over the
[50:29] job because in the book of job where I
[50:31] want to go let's go over there only
[50:38] let's go to juror chapter one
[50:48] and verse 1 there was a man in the land
[50:54] of us whose name was joke and that man
[50:58] was perfect and upright and one that
[51:03] fear of God in the chute evil so it's
[51:07] his joke was perfect okay verse 8 and
[51:12] the Lord said unto Satan what he thinks
[51:17] a joke I stop considered my servant job
[51:20] that there is none like him in the earth
[51:23] a perfect and upright man one that it
[51:26] should well that's me regardless she was
[51:28] evil two times he said chapter 2 and
[51:34] verse 3 and the Lord said unto Satan has
[51:42] not considered my servant job the Turk
[51:44] nothing like him in the earth are
[51:45] perfect and another outland one that
[51:47] feareth god and eschewed evil still he
[51:51] hold her fast his integrity although God
[51:54] moveis me against him to destroy him
[51:58] without cold the God is reminding Satan
[52:06] you know to remember the story yes
[52:09] you've got it heads built around Joe
[52:11] take the hitch down let me have him I'll
[52:13] make him curse you to your face he said
[52:16] okay go ahead but he said he still got
[52:22] his integrity all right now that word
[52:26] joke dire remember the other ones 85 49
[52:29] this is 85 39 x cubed maybe 3,500 run
[52:38] Aleeah 8535 I can't read my own nut
[52:41] right never gets cold so what is the
[52:45] word perfect about job where you
[52:47] mentioned in three times is the word
[52:50] perfect is the word complete it's
[52:53] morally innocent is having integrity
[53:01] one who is morally morally and ethically
[53:07] pure that's what that word meant that's
[53:16] what God was saying about Joe I don't
[53:20] see how the world it could be perfect
[53:21] back he was under the atone he made you
[53:25] don't write as I said a moment ago even
[53:29] made the atonement for his own kids he's
[53:32] no Bible written this gets made in the
[53:33] toilet he made it home for his kids and
[53:35] God said hmm so when you think about how
[53:43] did he get to be that way songs 18-plus
[53:51] that's the psalmist how this happened
[53:54] it's on the 18 and verse 30 p
[54:06] this is just where he got through saying
[54:08] that you run through a troop Lincoln
[54:10] over the long gun and forgot his ways
[54:12] perfect the word of the Lord has tried
[54:14] he has a buffer to all those that trust
[54:16] in him for who is life who is God saved
[54:20] the Lord are who is a rock save our God
[54:23] is God that Goethe thony was strength
[54:26] and maketh my way perfect right maketh
[54:33] my way perfect you know so we see that
[54:42] it's got to be the atonement that made
[54:44] of perfectly right they done what God
[54:47] said knew he said all for the offering
[54:50] they offered the offering and they stood
[54:52] underneath that there was nothing there
[54:56] to take away the desire to see him so in
[55:01] a lot of incidences they would go back
[55:03] and do the same thing right run yeah he
[55:08] finally became under the law the dalal
[55:13] became a record keeper exactly what it
[55:17] became that's right under the law back
[55:20] there with with them you know until it
[55:23] came into existence of the Ten
[55:24] Commandments it would be of your own
[55:31] heart when the law came into existence
[55:35] it started keeping records you better
[55:36] not have a science in and happen again
[55:38] before the next year could never you
[55:41] know God don't play around that's my
[55:44] point it is not something to where you
[55:46] just say what God just accepted the
[55:48] offering mmm these that I'm sick of your
[55:51] offerings they become a snake in my
[55:54] nostrils but an honest and a contrite
[55:57] heart is what I live to see see but when
[56:00] God says you're perfect what are you
[56:04] look at Ezekiel 28
[56:09] this is talking about Satan company
[56:16] North you know that your verse 14 the
[56:19] cover it and they'll made d so now how I
[56:22] wished upon the holy mountain of God
[56:24] thou has walked up and down in the midst
[56:27] of the stone to fire that was perfect in
[56:30] my way from the day that I was created
[56:33] till iniquity was found in thee it even
[56:40] says Satan was perfect yeah but nobody
[56:44] can be perfect well the Bible said Satan
[56:46] with us before you fell wrong right and
[56:50] that's what I've always tried to preach
[56:51] to you guys can't make any time man you
[56:57] can't make anything evil you can't make
[57:00] anything imperfect never creation God
[57:02] ever made is perfect and it's a term
[57:08] perfect you know until an egg with your
[57:13] child is perfect until it reaches the
[57:16] age of accountability is perfect don't
[57:22] you ever think that one but now when the
[57:27] record started being kept by the law
[57:28] would start keeping a record of night
[57:32] then we brought our self out from under
[57:35] the fact of the imperfect but just
[57:38] remember the atonement is what made you
[57:40] perfect now the same word our aunt
[57:45] ezekiel 28 15 is 85 49 which is the same
[57:50] identical word for talking and telling
[57:53] Abraham to walk before him and he'd be
[57:55] perfect and telling Noah that he was
[57:58] perfect till they were perfect
[58:06] he was perfect when he was created
[58:08] because it God cannot create anything
[58:10] that's not perfect all right but my
[58:14] point is that if God says they were
[58:17] perfect then they were perfect well then
[58:25] we ought to be going away look nobody
[58:27] can be perfect you thank you perfect I
[58:31] don't like this one a lot of you did
[58:33] I've heard you like that I learned you
[58:34] say see the bumper sticker said I'm not
[58:36] perfect I'm just revealing no no I can
[58:41] you may rejoice and say glory look at
[58:44] that no no that ain't sensible if you're
[58:48] forgiving your perfect to want to say
[58:53] I'm not perfect I'll just forgive them
[58:55] if I'm forgiving of perfect because it
[59:00] could be no record made of it if i
[59:02] forgiven right I'm not just forgiven I'm
[59:07] perfect if I'm forgiven get it Old
[59:14] Testament then sure it had to cover them
[59:17] but one day Jesus Christ came and died
[59:22] and they could not raise in the
[59:25] resurrection remember until Jesus Christ
[59:29] died remember that a few weeks ago then
[59:34] when Jesus Christ died it proved because
[59:38] they went up it proved we don't have to
[59:41] go through the dribble ison you remember
[59:43] that I just went to profit say it to
[59:46] write my kid we're leaving New we climb
[59:51] these are profit that's what gets me you
[59:52] like said about Moses want to go Moses
[59:55] go get it Helen tell us bread around
[59:57] tell us what to do he tells me something
[1:00:00] we say I don't like yet yeah I'm like it
[1:00:04] ain't gonna do it that way why don't we
[1:00:08] ask him to go fast God about Billy
[1:00:13] following down now this is what he said
[1:00:15] 11 says not
[1:00:16] you make the coin he said daddy told one
[1:00:21] person for what to do you told another
[1:00:23] person run officers what to do he said I
[1:00:29] told him what they wanted to hear what
[1:00:36] he said I told him what you wanted to
[1:00:38] hear but know this you say but brother
[1:00:45] they have ever only covered and they
[1:00:50] wasn't perfect what God didn't have any
[1:00:52] trouble using to doing right glad they
[1:00:55] know any trouble coming down and
[1:00:57] fellowshipping with the children literal
[1:00:58] you want to tell him that he was wrong
[1:01:02] you want to tell you that that high
[1:01:04] priest could actually walk right into if
[1:01:06] chief pilot glory and come back out and
[1:01:14] even the new ones the matter was put in
[1:01:18] there and the new priest was allowed to
[1:01:22] go in upon his time of we'd had to go in
[1:01:26] as a first trip you know he was allowed
[1:01:28] to take a piece of the original manner
[1:01:30] that it fallen in the wilderness and you
[1:01:34] gonna tell me that he's not perfect oh
[1:01:39] he was just covered with what is covered
[1:01:41] man that's right red to red you see why
[1:01:49] I gave you the quote are the other day
[1:01:52] were upset if I've got a spot on my hand
[1:01:55] and I like something over he said I just
[1:01:56] covered it it's still not right but he
[1:02:01] said if it's eradicated now that's what
[1:02:03] Jesus done to Calvary I could only be
[1:02:07] held on the dark the Calvary he made the
[1:02:12] atonement that eradicated the scene he
[1:02:17] eradicated the Old Testament sins and
[1:02:19] well are you and I all sin was pushed to
[1:02:23] Calvary vile said he died once
[1:02:27] they mad he for all of us hey man seeing
[1:02:34] the children of Israel that pillar of
[1:02:36] fire could hold over them the cloud was
[1:02:40] over them Moses could talk to you
[1:02:46] face-to-face he actually seen the back
[1:02:52] part of God the end of extending the
[1:02:55] cleft of the rock the same rock he had
[1:02:58] to smite get the water from the cleft of
[1:03:00] the rock but he's allowed to see it
[1:03:02] under the blood of bulls no that's right
[1:03:08] well of course nobody none of us / you
[1:03:13] don't think wrong asleep yeah you get to
[1:03:17] the only person that didn't do something
[1:03:20] wrong this week as a person that's in a
[1:03:21] comatose state they can't do it but they
[1:03:25] can still think if they're able to do
[1:03:28] that that makes still be wrong we better
[1:03:32] believe in anatomic that's right we
[1:03:37] don't need no talk no more weird tunnel
[1:03:40] it's only for the soul that's right why
[1:03:47] would we need an advocate with the
[1:03:50] father if it wasn't for the fact that he
[1:03:53] knew we were going to do wrong hey man
[1:03:55] run around do you see and he said after
[1:03:58] a day you argue your profit and gone
[1:04:04] about comes now you're going to argue it
[1:04:07] opens right up with the statement
[1:04:08] tomorrow stage now whether or not you
[1:04:11] believe it we're not gonna do us any
[1:04:12] good that's right then well I don't know
[1:04:15] if Brett Ratten said I believe it I
[1:04:24] invite you to go to the message instead
[1:04:26] and see if what I'm saying dry that's
[1:04:30] right and if it's not bring it to me man
[1:04:36] would you see what we want to talk about
[1:04:38] is these things in this their own to her
[1:04:40] own benefit her own way of doing what is
[1:04:43] it enough the most in Hebrew Stephen
[1:04:50] Ward we like that where the blood of
[1:04:52] bulls and goats could not make the cover
[1:04:54] thereunto perfect see that now I'd
[1:05:02] advise you not to use that scripture
[1:05:04] room I've said that before and our
[1:05:08] people's feelings but I'd advise you to
[1:05:10] not use that scripture run because if
[1:05:14] you say that scripture says that nobody
[1:05:17] in the Old Testament perfect then what
[1:05:23] are you gonna do the scriptures I get
[1:05:25] you where job was perfect right and
[1:05:27] we're no more was perfect and all that
[1:05:33] we preached about the atonement and what
[1:05:34] it's done well it said that why don't
[1:05:41] you read it in the language of the Bible
[1:05:47] why don't you read it to the corner say
[1:05:50] that like this those sacrifices and
[1:05:55] offerings could not bring eternal life
[1:05:58] right to the individual under that time
[1:06:03] yeah but brother branham never said it
[1:06:05] better way okay no problem
[1:06:16] he said in one place Judas went hung
[1:06:18] himself and in other places they go do
[1:06:20] likewise so where we going anything you
[1:06:29] give me the bread round said probably
[1:06:30] out of memory i can give you a quote
[1:06:32] from somewhere that seemed almost
[1:06:34] totally contrary them you give me a
[1:06:37] scripture and i can give you a scripture
[1:06:40] that seems totally contrary now you know
[1:06:45] that's true right but you know that's
[1:06:48] not true in the basis that that's the
[1:06:51] way it is it's not that away right man
[1:06:54] the Bible's ride the prophets right
[1:06:56] right man then where he had to correct
[1:06:58] he corrected all right we see where
[1:07:03] depended upon what a man said we were
[1:07:07] glad to say that he said about magazine
[1:07:09] divorce would take that we have one
[1:07:12] that's raw yeah he's right well what
[1:07:15] about over here what he said on the Rue
[1:07:18] Jordan no no no I don't agree with him
[1:07:24] there well we're weird do we believe
[1:07:36] God's Word that's the whole of what I
[1:07:39] got all the way down that's right
[1:07:46] see if you take scriptures on the new
[1:07:48] testament to say that that blood of
[1:07:51] bulls and goats couldn't make you
[1:07:52] perfect you better take it in the right
[1:07:54] way because it could not bring you
[1:08:00] eternal life butcher church like I've
[1:08:07] always seen if David under the blood of
[1:08:11] bulls and goats could kill a bear a line
[1:08:13] on a jonathan and wouldn't afraid of
[1:08:16] nothing and then we as christians are
[1:08:20] scared to death then we might get
[1:08:22] deceived oh my i missin brother but i'm
[1:08:27] gonna get to say no i've told you before
[1:08:29] you're all ready to see well let's take
[1:08:36] what roast oh but you won't tell you
[1:08:38] what run around says and the Bible says
[1:08:40] would you take what brother so a joke
[1:08:41] said you know why is because he says it
[1:08:46] the way you want it to be saying right
[1:08:53] hurt people making at to soak starting
[1:08:56] man said I believe that all of my mind
[1:08:59] it just now come out the man is
[1:09:01] preaching what I believed I guess that's
[1:09:04] true he probably did but you see church
[1:09:15] the Bible says they were perfect back
[1:09:20] there
[1:09:25] then how much more would it be under the
[1:09:27] blood of jesus christ by the back tears
[1:09:30] i'm going to hold the ghosts in your
[1:09:32] song right well you know what we ought
[1:09:37] to start staying more to sing that song
[1:09:42] what is it to the loot kid is it right
[1:09:45] let's see I am perfect I am as a hybrid
[1:09:49] I am blessed between God made me God
[1:09:54] made me I am special because we're going
[1:10:00] to get to a lot of these words and
[1:10:03] you're going to find out the word
[1:10:05] justified that's right the word
[1:10:08] specially to look on a dime the word
[1:10:11] righteous is going to take us about 20
[1:10:16] years to preach this winter we don't
[1:10:25] start saying I'm perfect vago all right
[1:10:27] no not perfect i'll just forgiven
[1:10:30] forgiven is the same word is perfect a
[1:10:33] man by the man known about them brett
[1:10:40] said you'll be neatly forgiving but not
[1:10:42] not justified you know what is nothing
[1:10:48] that tonight
[1:10:55] no wonder a man named David could you
[1:10:59] didn't spirit come on now and he say
[1:11:05] blessed is the man to whom God will not
[1:11:12] impute sin was that some kind of special
[1:11:18] genetic seed is everybody wants to make
[1:11:23] out of know of in the only righteous
[1:11:26] seat it was left they preach that folks
[1:11:31] well if he was there is no hope for any
[1:11:34] of us because everybody from they don't
[1:11:36] come through know what his kids that
[1:11:39] means it's kids with high freeze cuz it
[1:11:42] wasn't perfect you better say no and his
[1:11:44] wife was perfect then you got jacket but
[1:11:49] then you fall over on the other side you
[1:11:51] have noah and his wife being perfect and
[1:11:53] all their kids being perfect then you
[1:11:57] find it on the kids wives for not being
[1:11:59] perfect no whoa boy you've got to
[1:12:01] generation you got it you got a
[1:12:03] genealogy you got a great revelation a
[1:12:05] what when God said to to Satan you was
[1:12:14] perfect in your creation he was complete
[1:12:18] you was without integrity you was
[1:12:25] righteous you was just he was complete
[1:12:34] that's what he said to say well he
[1:12:39] really didn't mean that okay talk to God
[1:12:42] I just don't bleed no I just gonna
[1:12:48] believe what God's sake right see that's
[1:12:52] where we look at it we look at the Old
[1:12:54] Testament as a group of people that you
[1:12:57] know it's just all just a mess up how
[1:13:00] degree leave us now look at a bunch of
[1:13:02] people in the message people is just a
[1:13:06] bunch
[1:13:07] messe because the denominational people
[1:13:15] would never come up with a lot of the
[1:13:16] ideas and this message and good bad uses
[1:13:19] preach River Jordan my eyes right and
[1:13:22] lemon & goo that was you see church i'm
[1:13:27] trying to get us to say one time if you
[1:13:32] repent of your sins hello just repeat
[1:13:36] that's right you name that that could
[1:13:40] never be broke Michael again finish you
[1:13:43] that I thank you Father I thought we
[1:13:47] believed about which they would put in
[1:13:49] as far as Lisa the West's need
[1:13:50] forgetfulness right because that's what
[1:13:52] we believe did the east-west has no
[1:13:54] boundary north and south does you got
[1:13:56] hope you just keep going around by the
[1:13:58] other whatever you can't know how no
[1:14:01] ponies away so that made my center still
[1:14:04] going right that's just repentance a
[1:14:08] justification you repent of your sins
[1:14:14] God forgives your past amen let's see we
[1:14:18] don't we keep bringing it up though amen
[1:14:21] yep at least joe said I have done what
[1:14:26] he said for me to do what else can I
[1:14:31] toad that's right well you're just a
[1:14:35] secret Center well then show me where
[1:14:37] the sand that bring witnesses that I'm a
[1:14:42] sinner but even Jesus when he was good
[1:14:48] there on the ground and rope on that
[1:14:49] little prostitute see they had done
[1:14:53] wrong him over the barrel with it they
[1:14:55] said what does the law say right he
[1:15:00] should not change that because the word
[1:15:04] said she was to be stoned right he
[1:15:08] couldn't turn I forgive her that's what
[1:15:10] this won't need to do see he couldn't do
[1:15:15] it
[1:15:17] Coheed already set their way to be noisy
[1:15:20] said he got rid of the winds right he
[1:15:25] just condemned the paper it was wet us
[1:15:27] again i right you condemn them and they
[1:15:31] looked at herself considered just like
[1:15:33] her and they said if we could we go
[1:15:35] rocket her he don't know what it does
[1:15:38] you know he had every right to do it he
[1:15:43] said words your accusers she said not
[1:15:46] have him he said needed rocking them
[1:15:49] they go and see them live that's what we
[1:15:54] don't believe we don't believe that God
[1:15:56] he's able to forget I told you one of
[1:16:01] these days I'm gonna get up enough nerve
[1:16:02] to preach good i don't think i don't
[1:16:04] like it i moan for each other god
[1:16:06] without Aneesha i asked him to forgive
[1:16:12] me of my sins you know what he does he
[1:16:13] forgives me nobody said he says you're
[1:16:17] righteous you're just you stand before
[1:16:20] me complete move cuz i ain't no second i
[1:16:28] thought there's no saying I'm complete
[1:16:33] well I just try to live like an elder
[1:16:35] well you are the devil won't let this
[1:16:37] out without make my plant growing nicely
[1:16:42] within this windy I don't believe ever
[1:16:45] everybody know Desmond took the land up
[1:16:47] don't it now stood get it for me his
[1:16:50] sins wouldn't forget us he was just like
[1:16:54] it was when God told Moses you better go
[1:16:59] back and read that God told Moses he
[1:17:04] said you take him in and I won't kill
[1:17:06] him but he said I will judge them at
[1:17:11] another time read your Bible he said
[1:17:16] I'll judge you why because they wasn't
[1:17:20] covered it's just that man's word
[1:17:25] tell a bunch of people then turned
[1:17:26] around and tried their best to kill the
[1:17:28] main never way they could they tried to
[1:17:31] destroy Moses and he was only reason
[1:17:35] they was alive right right and they
[1:17:41] wanted to kill him they wanted to get
[1:17:43] rid of you were the only reason and all
[1:17:45] that was still live right the god said
[1:17:48] the time comes out judge so when that
[1:17:52] man throw that laying up there okay go
[1:17:56] ahead you don't want to see your actions
[1:18:05] are covered but I'll judge your heart
[1:18:06] right that's it who's your heart's not
[1:18:10] right because he said an honest in a
[1:18:14] contrite heart was what he was looking
[1:18:15] for he got tired of their offerings and
[1:18:20] sacrifices that he ordained for them to
[1:18:23] do what about you the night right but if
[1:18:28] under the blood of bulls and goats are
[1:18:30] you getting them one more time is about
[1:18:31] three times said if that covered them
[1:18:34] until they were perfect forgiven right
[1:18:39] why because it pushed it on to Calvary
[1:18:42] where Jesus paid the price had he not
[1:18:45] done that and wet the bed forgiven right
[1:18:47] never sacrifice was looking to Calvary
[1:18:51] when it come to Calvary he paid the
[1:18:53] price then they were wiped away and
[1:18:56] those Old Testament Saints one hood
[1:18:58] that's right Nolan didn't know what
[1:19:09] you don't say all of this I think worked
[1:19:15] as meaning that around I think sending
[1:19:17] me the Old Testament Saints rogue did it
[1:19:20] say all level right right one because it
[1:19:23] would a lot of them we're going to go to
[1:19:24] the judgment seat and be judged we can
[1:19:30] either put our send under the bud that's
[1:19:33] right so we can have to go to a judgment
[1:19:35] and if we're Christians were even still
[1:19:37] have a judgment of the deeds done in the
[1:19:39] body where they're good about it if we
[1:19:42] won't repent of our sins here we're
[1:19:43] going to face some dark and you know
[1:19:45] what we're going to face the people we
[1:19:47] send with four against or whatever we
[1:19:53] better get a straight here that's why I
[1:19:56] have no trouble saying if I've done
[1:19:57] anything against to you any of you I'm
[1:20:02] summary ever forgive me that's right I
[1:20:07] was doing what I thought was right I
[1:20:09] didn't know justification but it's just
[1:20:15] what I am amen don't watch the day is

[1:42:48] Bible said faith cometh by what you're
[1:42:50] hearing and hearing by the word of the
[1:42:53] Lord that's right I thought this one
[1:42:55] live kenny britt iran said that's why

[1:43:36] until I just keep saying when he said
[1:43:39] I'd not mine out I tried faith is simple

[1:43:49] you believe in your heart and faced with
[1:43:51] you man you're safe well I've seen
[1:43:56] millions brother Dale leaving her heart
[1:43:58] confessional Matthew but they really

[1:44:01] know it some was wrong Brown said if
[1:44:07] you're sincere and baptized in the name
[1:44:09] of the Lord Jesus Christ God is
[1:44:11] obligated to give you the baptism if
[1:44:15] you're sincere I try problem because he
[1:44:18] said you would ever what do you think
[1:44:21] about what was jobs action I have done
[1:44:26] what God told me to do right and there's
[1:44:32] just nothing else I can do he's all
[1:44:35] dependent upon whether or not he'll keep
[1:44:37] this word you know Lonnie witnessed by
[1:44:41] another chapter until leu come on the
[1:44:44] scene which was Christ and started
[1:44:46] ripping up them other three guys and
[1:44:49] telling them off cheering don't joke Sid
[1:44:51] you're just a little bit self-righteous
[1:44:54] that's what i'm listening to see this
[1:44:56] little bit set for action well you know
[1:44:58] walk us gun-toting do it done anything
[1:45:00] pretty babe did you see that spoke of
[1:45:06] Calvary because it wouldn't anything
[1:45:09] back there that could make the coma
[1:45:10] thereunto perfect but it could suffer it
[1:45:14] and making perfect until Jesus Christ
[1:45:17] died you think them Old Testament Saints
[1:45:21] wouldn't perfect if you're getting the
[1:45:23] scriptures things see things are opening
[1:45:25] to meet through the scripture just like
[1:45:27] right around them and you know you say
[1:45:29] well we can use this scripture we can
[1:45:30] use that scripture to show we don't go
[1:45:32] through the tribulation he used the
[1:45:33] scripture those Old Testament Saints
[1:45:35] raised he said that shows we don't go
[1:45:40] through the tribulation because they
[1:45:43] raised it proved that they were perfect
[1:45:48] when they walked out of paradise and
[1:45:51] went up with the Lord Jesus
[1:45:55] cuz have the win the moment when it went
