[14:51] just bless and keep us all in your grace
[14:55] in Jesus name Amen brother Tony and
[14:58] sister Esther I think was traveling too
[15:01] so remember number all of these amen
[15:06] first Peter 1:22 seeing you have
[15:11] purified your souls and obeying the
[15:13] truth through the spirit unto unfeigned
[15:15] love of the Brethren see that you love
[15:17] one another with a pure heart fervently
[15:20] being born again not of corruptible seed
[15:23] but of incorruptible by the Word of God
[15:26] which liveth and abideth for ever I love
[15:30] that scripture because it's talking
[15:31] about the Word of God that's where we're
[15:34] at okay Hebrews 10 5 for the law having
[15:40] a shadow of good things to come and not
[15:43] the very image of the things can never
[15:45] with those sacrifices which they offer
[15:48] year by year continually make the comers
[15:51] darn to perfect for then would they not
[15:55] have ceased to be offered because that
[15:59] the worshiper once purged should have no
[16:01] more conscience of sin you know we have
[16:06] gotten in trouble I guess you called it
[16:08] with a lot of the ministers of the
[16:10] message today because we've always made
[16:13] one stand in this that the Old Testament
[16:18] people there's a Salvation there forum
[16:22] there was a place for him to go to when
[16:24] they died all those things but there was
[16:26] no way they could receive the new birth
[16:28] there was no way they could receive
[16:30] eternal life this scripture shows you
[16:33] because if it had they wouldn't made
[16:34] those offering huh and see we don't
[16:38] think and and want to take the
[16:40] scriptures to see you know what we're
[16:44] doing we want our ideas well I just
[16:46] don't see that well that's alright go
[16:49] ahead for the wouldn't then verse 2
[16:53] would they have not would they not how
[16:56] ceased to be offered because the worst
[16:59] were once purged should have no more
[17:00] conscience of sin but in those
[17:03] sacrifices there is a remembrance again
[17:06] made us sins every year where it is not
[17:10] possible that the blood of bulls and
[17:11] goats should take away sins so it can't
[17:14] do it alright
[17:16] we're for when he cometh into the world
[17:18] he says sacrifice and offerings I would
[17:22] it's not but a body thou hast prepared
[17:25] me you may be seated the Lord to have
[17:27] his way with the reading of the word and
[17:31] for us into the understanding we tried
[17:37] to bring a message there Sunday and you
[17:41] know we'll pick up on that in this to
[17:44] really be a I guess you called it almost
[17:47] total repeat but it's because I want you
[17:51] to understand what we're trying to say
[17:55] and the way we're trying to bring things
[17:58] we're talking about the stature of a
[18:00] perfect man all right and we've got
[18:02] through and it's covered a lot of the
[18:04] things where the Prophet shows that the
[18:07] new birth faith you must have faith to
[18:10] be born again you can't add these
[18:12] virtues until you get faith you can't
[18:15] come to and climb up the the pyramid
[18:18] until you first start at faith bringing
[18:21] the new birth or were you know that we
[18:23] should do it and and that new birth is a
[18:26] very very valuable thing because as I
[18:29] was ending up and I'll repeat it in the
[18:33] message that you know the new birth the
[18:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost brings God in
[18:40] you
[18:41] makes it Christ in you the hope of glory
[18:44] brings you eternal life in your soul
[18:47] brings it to the position that God is
[18:50] living in you all right
[18:53] but the main thing now right now is I'm
[18:55] trying to make a point to where when we
[18:58] do start with the virtues and talking
[19:01] about what each one is and what it is
[19:04] and that works and things then we won't
[19:07] have to back up so far to cover things
[19:10] we try to get them into enough to give
[19:13] us understanding that then we can just
[19:15] say things and move on in the Lord all
[19:20] right but we we covered this past Sunday
[19:25] you know in the message that I really
[19:28] enjoy brother Forney Wednesday night
[19:30] you've done a good job and appreciate
[19:32] him you know but we were talking about
[19:35] how that the new birth no this was the
[19:40] point then and we'll pick it up the new
[19:42] birth brings you eternal life into your
[19:44] soul all right but it doesn't bring
[19:48] eternal life into the body or spirit
[19:51] that will take the end time and that's
[19:55] worth it that God has given us the the
[19:58] message to understand how and were and
[20:01] what and all is to transpire in this day
[20:04] and what a wonderful thing it is to have
[20:07] the truth to be revealed to us but to
[20:11] see that we're not born again in our
[20:13] body we're not born again in their
[20:14] spirit we're born again in our soul all
[20:17] right now here's the point of the day so
[20:19] listen and you'll see it this morning
[20:22] this afternoon the new birth makes that
[20:25] soul eternal okay that's the dwelling
[20:30] place of God we should have known that
[20:34] in the Baptist Church the method I mean
[20:36] where we come from we at least taught a
[20:38] little bit about it and we talked about
[20:40] that the bright OGIS are the church back
[20:43] then we didn't know to call it bright
[20:45] but we called it church that the church
[20:47] was the body of Jesus Christ all right
[20:52] and sees in that church by being the
[20:54] body of Christ God comes and lives in
[20:57] these bodies okay and he gives eternal
[21:01] life to that soul so I bury you and can
[21:04] cover that and that's what we were
[21:06] covering about the tabernacle of God all
[21:11] right see then eternal life comes into
[21:13] the soul but that's not the finish all
[21:17] right because there were many parts in
[21:19] the Old Testament to bring forth the
[21:22] tabernacle it kept advancing as we'll
[21:25] review in a second it kept coming forth
[21:27] from this to this to this for God could
[21:30] come and dwell in in in Jesus Christ and
[21:33] the human flesh and then give away that
[21:36] then it could start in you and I all
[21:38] right see then the tabernacle of God
[21:41] sure the new birth
[21:43] the born-again experience brings God
[21:46] into you and I makes us the body of
[21:49] Christ all right but it's not finished
[21:52] just because you get the new birth
[21:55] because we still have a body in spirit
[21:58] to deal with all right now in the Old
[22:01] Testament the tabernacle was annihilated
[22:06] right now follow the point of what I say
[22:11] in Sunday see Moses built the tent after
[22:16] what God gave him the pattern in heaven
[22:19] and he built the tent the tabernacle of
[22:23] God
[22:23] you know the skins and the things all
[22:25] right that stayed in existence until
[22:30] Solomon Solomon then you know come in to
[22:37] making because David couldn't do it we
[22:39] know the story but he provided
[22:41] everything for Solomon his son to to
[22:44] bring forth a temple or a tabernacle all
[22:47] right see then there was no more use of
[22:49] the tent you know the badger skins etc
[22:53] the thing so it was taken out of the way
[22:55] I don't know what they done with it if
[22:58] it depend me I would have probably tried
[23:00] to store it in a good place to just make
[23:03] it an antique when you or something that
[23:05] would be valuable to keep because it was
[23:07] the dwelling place of God because when
[23:09] that when Moses finished that God proved
[23:13] that he was happy with it because he
[23:16] come behind the veil right he come
[23:19] behind the veil they could have even
[23:21] Minister they couldn't do he came behind
[23:24] the veil of the inner veil part of the
[23:27] tabernacle or tent that Moses had made
[23:29] all right but see then when Solomon came
[23:32] into being building the tabernacle you
[23:36] know there see then it lasted for a long
[23:40] time and it was destroyed right but then
[23:45] it had to be restored and that's why I
[23:47] was bringing out I hope you caught that
[23:49] point that restoration is more valuable
[23:53] than we think
[23:54] we talked about that were to breathe
[23:56] to the faith of the fathers to this that
[23:59] or the other and then say well well we
[24:01] just don't see this don't see that it's
[24:03] more valuable for restoration that it is
[24:06] infer for what you start with you said
[24:10] well where's that at all right according
[24:13] to I believe it what is it Hagee I were
[24:15] that the latter house was more marvelous
[24:21] than the former our first house
[24:23] in other words Solomon and all of his
[24:25] beauty when it come to this restoration
[24:30] of the natural temple right then the
[24:36] restoration of the natural temple said
[24:38] the the glory of the latter house was
[24:41] more wonderful one because it was
[24:43] restoration in like I told you they they
[24:48] didn't Solomon you know everything was
[24:51] so perfect not the sound of a bus or
[24:53] anything sawing or what everything was
[24:56] done over here somewhere and then
[24:58] transported and brought in and all those
[25:01] stones placed in place and not not even
[25:04] a bit of hammering around or doing
[25:06] everything was so perfect you didn't
[25:08] have to chisel it down make it fit I'm
[25:11] going to come out to make a wonderful
[25:13] beautiful temple but why then would the
[25:15] Bible say that the latter house is more
[25:18] beautiful why would it say that when
[25:23] when Solomon and his great beauty of
[25:25] what he done when what they done in the
[25:27] latter house they just took a lot of the
[25:29] stones and just put them back in you
[25:32] know this made of walls and made this
[25:34] and made what they could they didn't go
[25:37] back and review all of this and make all
[25:40] of this back into they just had to use
[25:43] what they had and it was placed back in
[25:46] together sure they had to bring some
[25:48] stones and make them in shape them and
[25:50] everything else but the point what I'm
[25:53] getting at see why would it say the
[25:55] latter house because it was restoration
[26:00] restoration is more valuable then than
[26:04] it is to say what you start with if you
[26:07] restore something a
[26:09] you know it's greater than what you have
[26:13] in the beginning right some of you want
[26:16] to buy a good a model you've got about
[26:19] 50,000 bucks or something or $100,000
[26:22] you can buy an a model one because it's
[26:25] been restored restoration it's a whole
[26:28] lot more valuable than what's the point
[26:31] I was trying to get you to see Sunday
[26:33] that the latter house what didn't where
[26:38] Jesus came in and the temple was there
[26:40] and all of the things the Bible said
[26:43] that was greater than all the other code
[26:45] it would be restoration season it wound
[26:49] up that was destroyed and that was
[26:53] destroyed after Christ and watch the
[26:56] overlap to her they were so beautiful
[26:58] that she had Christ there can't you just
[27:03] see those Jews no wonder they couldn't
[27:04] understand because you know what they
[27:08] could stand and look at that temple and
[27:11] Jesus was talking about his own self
[27:17] right he was talking about himself even
[27:22] to work destroy this temple they said
[27:26] you mean you're gonna tear down in this
[27:27] temple and all you gonna do that he was
[27:30] talking about his own body and what
[27:33] about see the reason the Jews couldn't
[27:35] accept him because he was supposed to be
[27:37] in behind the veil
[27:41] according to their understanding he
[27:43] wasn't supposed to be out there talking
[27:45] are you following me I'm trying to get
[27:49] you to see what restoration means to you
[27:51] if you can follow it because we are to
[27:54] be restored back to the original faith
[27:56] that was once delivered to the Saints
[27:59] and that's more glorious than when it
[28:03] was brought because its restoration God
[28:09] is more pleased in the end times than he
[28:11] was back Dyer is what I'm trying to get
[28:14] you to see I'm trying to get you to see
[28:16] restoration as to restoring that what
[28:19] God is trying to do with you and I is to
[28:22] bring us back to that original faith and
[28:26] by bringing it back to that original
[28:28] faith it'll be a greater day well I just
[28:32] don't see nothing going on then you
[28:36] never will with that attitude you never
[28:39] will see anything that's going on
[28:43] because you're not looking at it the way
[28:45] it's supposed to be you're not looking
[28:48] at it the way God looks at it what if
[28:51] you'd have been able to bend back guard
[28:52] seen Solomon's Temple and seeing all of
[28:55] those huge stones and all of those great
[28:57] thing and then you seen that they had to
[29:03] restore that one day and they wasn't
[29:08] able to bring back all of that stuff
[29:09] that David brought in this that in the
[29:11] other they had to do the best they could
[29:13] I'm just making a point to you to where
[29:16] you look at restoration the faith of the
[29:19] fathers is more valuable to you than you
[29:22] could ever think about all right because
[29:25] that's what I'm talking about of the
[29:27] statue of a perfect man see the faith of
[29:30] the father's being restored the statue
[29:32] of a perfect man bringing it back
[29:33] brother Brennan said those disciples had
[29:36] these virtues well then if the latter
[29:40] house is to be greater than the former
[29:42] how much more would it be valuable today
[29:44] to understand and walk in the virtues
[29:48] and things that God could bring it into
[29:50] the church when
[29:52] don't say again what does that mean it's
[29:56] not dire because you don't see it I
[30:00] guess it means it's not in existence
[30:03] right let's see Church day and that's
[30:06] what I'm trying to drive the point to us
[30:09] restoration means more than what we
[30:11] could think about is to bring back the
[30:16] original faith in an hour and time when
[30:21] all mankind those disciples faced only
[30:24] the Pharisees and Sadducees and maybe
[30:27] one or two little fling all groups or
[30:30] something they didn't have but a couple
[30:32] of groups to face right but yet we're
[30:38] facing thousands of denominations and
[30:43] how many in this message and look how
[30:47] it's going now when the point is trying
[30:49] to get this the Prophet to bring the
[30:53] message to us to restore the original
[30:56] faith and the people of the message are
[30:59] destroying the message that the Prophet
[31:01] is brought see they're trying to tire
[31:05] the temple back down to him but this
[31:08] don't worry about it it's going to be
[31:09] there
[31:10] God's going to make it it may not be
[31:12] with a handful of people when he's gonna
[31:14] do it it's gonna be there I don't care
[31:17] what we think about it it's going to be
[31:19] there and you can doubt all you want to
[31:23] that's what I said people are saying
[31:25] well I just don't if we think we've got
[31:27] what we've got what we were to be doing
[31:29] this out the other and I told you
[31:31] because I pointed out and looked that
[31:33] day I said I'm looking at the reason
[31:36] that it ain't happening
[31:37] because you're not believing it you're
[31:42] not believing it now the Lord willing
[31:46] it'll be next Sunday cause brother Bob
[31:47] is like but I pray that you'll be here
[31:50] next Sunday or at least listen because
[31:52] I'm gonna try to lay it down hard and
[31:55] strong of what I've been saying all
[31:58] along so next week will be a very
[32:01] valuable thing you know so make sure you
[32:04] either get the tape or are you here to
[32:06] listen if you can because I want to try
[32:09] to make it hard and strong but to show
[32:11] what God has been a doing and he's doing
[32:13] it now see we're looking for things to
[32:17] take place well often wonder see we're
[32:25] looking for this we're looking for that
[32:27] how long did it take to make the temple
[32:29] I never looked it up to see but the
[32:34] Bible says forty and nine years in the
[32:36] building of the you know it is forty-six
[32:38] correctly and then the three to finish
[32:41] the outside and the forty and nine years
[32:45] everyday they got up what we're gonna do
[32:49] today we're gonna put that stone in play
[32:53] we're gonna do this we're gonna do that
[32:56] what we do yesterday we put that stone
[32:59] in play but what we're gonna do tomorrow
[33:02] we're gonna put that one here what are
[33:04] we gonna do the next day we're gonna put
[33:06] one more here your are you listening it
[33:10] wasn't a great glorious time that they
[33:13] were hollered
[33:13] oh we're building the temple of God
[33:16] we're making a doctor sweating working
[33:20] day in and day out for 49 years and then
[33:26] you come up with an idea of saying now I
[33:28] don't see nothing going on even the
[33:31] breath you breathe it's a mighty
[33:33] marvelous thing of God and His glory
[33:36] I think don't sing you don't breathe
[33:42] stop try that but see that's where we're
[33:48] not looking at it in the serious matter
[33:50] we're looking at it in our parts we
[33:54] think we're supposed to have this or how
[33:56] that or have that show me in the Bible
[33:58] we're supposed to be come on I've taught
[34:02] it over and over I don't love to worry
[34:04] about it I've been teaching in 50 years
[34:06] I ain't worried about it I've always
[34:08] looked for a revival but us never been a
[34:12] revival like the world has talked about
[34:14] and it's not a revival like the
[34:16] believers in this messy talking about
[34:18] I'm talking about a revival of God
[34:20] word a restoration of God's Word to
[34:23] bring back God among the people
[34:25] that's the revival I'm talking about not
[34:28] a world wide sweeping revival not all of
[34:31] this out of the other that's to the Jews
[34:33] but see to gradually day-by-day grow in
[34:38] grace and knowledge and be able to stand
[34:40] when everything else is falling look at
[34:44] them that may be the people that brought
[34:45] you into the message may be the people
[34:50] that brought you into the message and
[34:52] you look at them now where are they
[34:56] tearing the message down instead of
[35:00] trying to put the temple together their
[35:02] time they're trying to tie it apart but
[35:05] do you understand what I'm saying when
[35:09] those Jews put that temple back together
[35:11] god looked down and he came again read
[35:16] the Bible he came into tent and they
[35:20] couldn't even minister he came when
[35:22] there Solomon got it ready
[35:23] he couldn't minister go and read us in
[35:26] Haggai on through there the different
[35:27] places when they restored the temple God
[35:30] came down into that temple all he needs
[35:36] is for me and you to get the temple
[35:37] ready for him he'll do the coming when
[35:40] we try to make this happen or that
[35:42] happen and then we look at it and say I
[35:45] just don't see nothing
[35:51] would you have seen anything if you'd
[35:53] have been down in Egypt and day by day
[35:57] you was walking in God's Word
[36:02] 40 years they walked in God's work
[36:06] brother Daniel what do you mean I mean
[36:09] it was a promise they'd be down there
[36:11] that long that was God's Word but how
[36:15] would you felt when you was a slave and
[36:17] being beat and killed and kicked around
[36:19] and everything every day you wouldn't I
[36:21] thought you was in the Word of God
[36:22] you wouldn't thought you were being
[36:24] fulfilling the Word of God do we look at
[36:28] the glory we look at the day of the end
[36:30] and we see a glory of something
[36:32] happening but we don't see 49 years and
[36:37] building the temple before God could
[36:41] come into it till we run our own
[36:47] thousand I did I don't see nothing going
[36:49] on if we had these great signs and
[36:52] wonders I could believe God is with us
[36:54] or you're a good example you're a good
[36:58] candidate for the devil in his days and
[37:01] hours
[37:04] well I just why don't you just go home
[37:07] and forget it he said what I don't know
[37:13] what let's go home and go somewheres
[37:15] else
[37:15] and forget it I'm not against anybody I
[37:18] don't want to run nobody out I'm trying
[37:20] my best Emil you and I to it to a place
[37:23] where we can take the punishment and
[37:25] live in the time when everything else is
[37:29] going against it till all even the
[37:31] people like I said the people that
[37:33] brought you into the message go back and
[37:37] think of some of those churches you were
[37:38] in and and what they've done since that
[37:41] time it's the church we don't look at it
[37:48] like a we want this great glory we
[37:52] wanted right there is a time when that
[37:55] transpires but remember the point God
[38:01] came down in that tent and lived in it
[38:05] his presence was with the children of
[38:08] Israel as they journeyed through the
[38:10] land Solomon build him a temple and he
[38:15] settled on us reading there this morning
[38:16] just looking at Solomon's he built that
[38:19] temple he built a place for God to dwell
[38:22] and God told him said I've been all of
[38:24] this I've been up and down you don't
[38:26] have to do these things for me because
[38:28] I've been happy to dwell among you
[38:31] richly Bible but he said in other words
[38:35] like I tried to proclaim that proclaim
[38:37] Sunday God was simply saying all right
[38:43] all right you want to do this I'll let
[38:47] you build this I'll let you build this
[38:51] tent
[38:54] to Moses what you see we don't look at
[39:01] it the way that God do it you realize
[39:07] read your Bible
[39:10] do you realize that Moses was told taken
[39:15] up into heaven and showing what to bill
[39:19] you remember me trying to explain that
[39:22] Sunday was he took up our shoulder board
[39:26] over here in a border with our put this
[39:27] board that I put this 10 time which is
[39:29] coming to our DDC Jesus Christ which did
[39:33] he see
[39:34] did you see Almighty God or did you see
[39:37] a bunch of tents and he was looking at
[39:41] one thing everybody else looking at
[39:42] something held that lie stood until
[39:47] Solomon came forth and then when it did
[39:51] it was dismantled are set aside as you
[39:54] want to call it Solomon built a house
[39:58] read it and along in the scripture there
[40:00] to where he was talking God to mankind I
[40:03] don't need this I've been happy to dwell
[40:07] among you but you've got it in your
[40:09] heart David that was what was so
[40:11] glorious David got in his heart he
[40:13] wanted to build God a temple he said I
[40:16] live in a house of Cedars and things he
[40:19] said God has to dwell out you're an
[40:20] emptiness that I'm cool the wind blowing
[40:25] through sand he's out after the hot Sun
[40:29] that stirred God's heart he said okay
[40:35] David you couldn't do it we said all
[40:38] that saw them and do it but David set
[40:42] out Solomon never had to do anything
[40:44] Solomon all he had to do was a symbol
[40:47] because David had everything ready David
[40:51] he could have said well okay I'll just
[40:54] go live and have a good time forget it
[40:56] no he said outright as quick as he's
[40:58] knew that he would not even be able to
[41:00] restore the temple itself he set out to
[41:03] set aside everything get this get that
[41:06] bring all together because I want you to
[41:09] go and read your Bible sometime find
[41:11] where Solomon was told of God how to
[41:14] build a tent I mean the the tabernacle
[41:16] short to me
[41:20] God told Moses how to do it right
[41:27] come on when Solomon picks up its the
[41:30] inter the things that was in there that
[41:37] God deals with Solomon he doesn't deal
[41:42] with him Moses he tells him how big how
[41:46] long what to do
[41:48] Solomon he doesn't tell him that you
[41:51] know why because you wouldn't listen and
[41:55] Sunday to what I was talking about
[41:57] so when Moses when Moses was told of God
[42:05] you want to do this I'll let you do it I
[42:09] don't have to have these things but if
[42:12] you want to build it I'll take you up
[42:13] here and show you how to do it and he's
[42:16] shouting Jesus Christ it's like we
[42:18] talked about
[42:19] that the the pyramid is some Bible and
[42:23] stone right and when it come forth Moses
[42:33] put it all into two words do this build
[42:37] that make this bill that come over into
[42:40] Solomon and see where if you find him
[42:42] telling him that God telling him how to
[42:44] do it he didn't have to he done told
[42:47] something Moses what to build Solomon
[42:52] just put into a different manifestation
[42:56] our parts you know what God had told
[43:00] Moses to build Moses was taken up in the
[43:04] Mount remember and shown there in the
[43:07] mouth while he was up there 240 days
[43:09] getting his riding and that's when God
[43:11] told him how to build it in you know the
[43:14] Tabernacle in the wilderness was show me
[43:16] where Solomon was taken up to show he
[43:19] didn't have to be
[43:22] the prophet Moses had already brought
[43:25] the banner of how to do it that's why
[43:30] you can't compare the tent that was laid
[43:32] out because it was this that and the
[43:34] other and then Solomon coming in and
[43:36] building all that up but Solomon was
[43:38] building the same thing in stone and and
[43:42] other things that Moses was told in
[43:44] heaven he didn't have to go to heaven
[43:49] it was restoration it was restoring our
[43:57] bringing forth into a different manner
[44:00] of God manifesting himself but finally
[44:07] that temple was torn down right but then
[44:13] when it was tore down they started again
[44:18] read over there were even like a heathen
[44:20] king he would know jew-- when those men
[44:29] come in and told him you know I want to
[44:31] go back and build my house he said you
[44:35] take anything I've got I'll just send a
[44:39] word ahead of you he got on his email
[44:42] and he said I had a thing to all the
[44:46] whole his country and said you give him
[44:51] anything he wants they didn't have to
[44:55] buy nothing that teeing supplied
[44:59] everything that would take to restore
[45:02] that temple don't you think he might get
[45:05] eternal life but understand what I'm
[45:09] trying to drive that then when that
[45:13] temple was finished God came the third
[45:16] time code he came in Moses and they
[45:18] couldn't minister he came in Solomon and
[45:20] they couldn't minister he comes again
[45:22] and they said it couldn't even Minister
[45:27] because of his presence
[45:31] but get back to the point as tall now
[45:33] that's why those Jews couldn't follow it
[45:37] they couldn't follow it because they
[45:42] thought God was behind the veil right
[45:51] where did the Jews thank God was come on
[45:55] he was behind the veil right they didn't
[46:00] know he'd left
[46:02] paddy left come on you just can't
[46:06] understand God in those ways
[46:08] because remember God can deal the way he
[46:11] wants to it always surprised me too
[46:13] brother around him to say God was still
[46:15] dealing with Israel forty years after
[46:17] Calvary we thought immediately Calvary
[46:21] cut off it dude and that's it
[46:23] uh-uh God was still dealing with Israel
[46:27] forty years later now that's what your
[46:31] prophet said that's what brother Brent
[46:33] says things that's hard for mankind to
[46:35] follow would you understand here's a man
[46:41] walking I've talked to claiming to be
[46:42] the God of glory
[46:44] you're a man making yourself caught and
[46:48] here he was preaching to him day in and
[46:51] day out and they said we don't believe
[46:59] you
[46:59] because if we hear of anything it'll be
[47:02] from behind a veil and said we don't
[47:05] right now have too many prophets that
[47:08] can go behind our because remember they
[47:10] have kind of got under control of the
[47:13] Romans you know and it's people all
[47:17] right what are you getting me God walks
[47:23] among mankind he's done gone from behind
[47:27] a veil come out into the original veil
[47:30] that he wanted you remember Sunday me
[47:33] trying to explain that what was God's
[47:35] original veil
[47:36] what was it before time ever begun you
[47:39] don't believe God had a body
[47:42] well I just don't believe God had a body
[47:44] back then well why did he have no why
[47:53] can't you say he had a body don't you
[47:57] think he had a place to dwell come on be
[48:03] serious well I do I just don't think he
[48:06] had a body go to random city did he
[48:11] called it a theophany yeah and things
[48:14] like that but he said it was a body he
[48:17] said God is not without a body he said
[48:20] he's not like the wind remember we've
[48:21] been through all of these things you
[48:23] ordered listen
[48:26] but those Jews couldn't understand that
[48:31] dar was the god of glory standing
[48:33] outside and they were saying no he's
[48:36] back to her he stood back to her if we
[48:39] can ever find this and get it right to
[48:40] where we get through to go behind there
[48:42] we'll find out some old cause behind
[48:44] ours where we find it from our and I
[48:47] listened our God does send a prophet now
[48:54] is that right that's where we don't
[48:59] follow the message in the Bible you know
[49:01] Jews the Jews was looking forward you
[49:05] know the Jews right today believe
[49:10] that Elijah will precede the coming
[49:13] Messiah
[49:18] come on get serious and you're thinking
[49:22] they believe that the Messiah can't come
[49:26] until the Prophet comes on the scene
[49:30] they believe Elijah will come that guy
[49:34] that was was there with us he we sat
[49:37] down we talked see they believe that
[49:42] Elijah is gonna come and precede the
[49:47] coming Messiah but they don't see that
[49:51] he was to come through the Gentiles and
[49:53] the time they believe he was to be a Jew
[50:01] you know those Jews believe actually
[50:03] Elijah will be able to tell them right
[50:06] where to put the temple and when they
[50:09] finished the temple then the Messiah's
[50:11] coming come on they're in the Thames
[50:14] they're not like us playing around well
[50:16] I don't know worth anything going on and
[50:18] on I just don't see nothing it's just
[50:21] it's just a bad day and it's horrible
[50:24] why was the other phone he says well he
[50:26] was he was but do you understand what
[50:30] I'm getting at what if you was a Jew and
[50:34] Jesus come up declaring himself to be
[50:36] God you'd say get behind the veil and
[50:40] I'll listen to you
[50:42] right you spoke to be back tyre you
[50:45] ain't supposed to be out here come on
[50:51] are you with me
[50:54] those Jews were thinking God was behind
[50:57] the veil but he doesn't walk from behind
[51:01] the veil and become into human flesh to
[51:06] the dwelling place of Almighty God which
[51:09] would be a body not a temple not a
[51:13] tabernacle but would be a body that God
[51:16] could come and dwell in
[51:21] what's that not who he was was he not
[51:26] the body of Almighty God
[51:28] all right Church then why can't we will
[51:31] see it see then the bride of Jesus
[51:33] Christ is that body we are the body of
[51:42] Christ that's what I'm trying to get
[51:43] across we are the body of Christ that's
[51:50] why he's not here in a corporal body
[51:53] because it would be contrary to
[51:55] Scripture see they thought he was back
[52:01] there and him saying he was out here he
[52:08] wasn't back there God wasn't behind the
[52:14] veil he had stepped out from behind the
[52:18] veil and coming to human flesh they said
[52:24] we won't anything God will go behind the
[52:26] veil we'll get a profit we'll do this
[52:28] we'll do that and there he stood in the
[52:36] body that he had brought into being
[52:42] to where he could live in you think well
[52:47] God brother Dale you you you seem to try
[52:50] to make it that God is a man I didn't
[52:52] try to make it God made it that way
[52:54] I didn't say it the prophets when it
[52:58] said it I didn't write the Bible let us
[53:01] make man in our own image our own
[53:04] likeness and let them have dominion over
[53:06] there I didn't write the book I didn't
[53:10] write in him dwelt a fullness of the
[53:12] Godhead bodily
[53:14] and I surely didn't finish the book up
[53:18] as the Prophet saying the bride is the
[53:21] fullness of the Godhead bodily
[53:22] she's his body right now that's why we
[53:25] don't he don't come to earth in a
[53:28] physical form well brother branham was
[53:33] garden we'll see then you done broke his
[53:35] scriptures because you got him in a
[53:37] bodily form he don't come in a bodily
[53:41] form we meet him in the air right at
[53:46] this present time where's he at the body
[53:50] is sitting on the throne
[53:53] revelations right for the body is on the
[53:56] throne but we are his body the bride of
[54:04] Jesus Christ is the body of Almighty God
[54:07] come on is that what your prophet had to
[54:10] say about it I mean it do you want me to
[54:16] read that we're his body come on how
[54:23] about reading this season's one 22 and
[54:27] 23 the church is the body the church
[54:33] which is his body the fullness of him
[54:37] that filleth all in all seasons 5 and 31
[54:43] for we are members of his body of his
[54:45] flesh and of his bones
[54:49] it hurts don't you understand what we're
[54:52] here for
[54:53] don't you understand what a purpose for
[54:56] us to be God wanted to live in a human
[55:02] flesh he didn't want to live in a tent
[55:04] he said I'd build them come on you
[55:09] remember Sunday we're talking about God
[55:11] was saying back to the empathy if I
[55:13] needed that I'd build it out of pure
[55:14] gold I'd make it yeah you know I mean
[55:16] I'd build a great bit I wouldn't be
[55:18] building all this stuff out here it
[55:19] wouldn't be no tent luring around it
[55:21] being our condition building might have
[55:26] the wind coming since emotional in
[55:28] meetings from COO but he said you're
[55:34] wanting to do it you're wanting to build
[55:36] me a body so go ahead go ahead
[55:42] Moses make it like this Moses made it
[55:50] Solomon picked it up and made it and put
[55:54] it into stone what Moses had ins in
[55:57] skins and things as all we're speaking
[56:00] of Jesus Christ every stone in that
[56:03] building was speaking of Christ
[56:05] everything that they done was speaking
[56:07] of Christ would you see that had to be
[56:14] running along as I said if he was
[56:16] listening that's the only time God and
[56:20] his temple that man had provided was
[56:24] there together
[56:27] are you listening when Jesus Christ
[56:31] walked on this earth they had that holy
[56:36] of holies right there right and they
[56:38] believed God was in that holy of holies
[56:40] right because the temple had been
[56:43] restored it had been brought back Jesus
[56:47] come out turn talk to him about it said
[56:48] you know he said restore this tear this
[56:52] down now build it back and read it they
[56:54] said what do you mean you gonna build
[56:55] this back through that and with 40 in
[56:56] nine years
[56:59] it's 49 years building in weight went
[57:03] through all of that showing how that
[57:05] took all of that 49 years of restoration
[57:07] it's not talking about the fact of
[57:09] motive Solomon how long it took or Moses
[57:12] how long it took it was the restoration
[57:17] restoration is more valuable than you
[57:20] think
[57:21] restoration means to bring back into the
[57:24] original form of what you had in the
[57:27] beginning
[57:28] that's restoration restoration was not
[57:31] God building and doing this over here
[57:34] and making it that away and then he gots
[57:36] to come over here and build something
[57:37] different that's what I tried to get you
[57:40] to see Sunday church God showed Moses
[57:48] how to build it
[57:51] Solomon wasn't told how to build it why
[57:54] because he followed Moses you're
[57:58] listening that's a very valuable point
[58:00] and thought Moses had already said what
[58:04] to do Solomon just moved it over in a
[58:06] different form and made it different
[58:09] Moses was told how to build a tent in
[58:12] the tabernacle and exactly Eden was
[58:14] shown how to make a pyramid what was
[58:17] they both doing making God in forms to
[58:21] word that he could be seen or where he
[58:24] was living with when it come down to him
[58:27] walking upon the shores of Galilee there
[58:29] was the very God of glory Israel could
[58:33] not understand how their God had left
[58:36] them behind the veil
[58:39] they couldn't follow that their guard
[58:42] was behind the veil if God had walked
[58:47] from behind the veil because he had
[58:49] stepped into human flesh which was the
[58:52] body he wanted now listen for a second
[58:56] before we read something God was not
[59:01] going to just build a people he wanted
[59:05] the people he could live in he had his
[59:08] own body remember what I wasn't saying
[59:12] on another day he said hold it if I
[59:14] wanted to build this I'd build it right
[59:15] see he's the one that built the body of
[59:18] Jesus Christ the way he wanted it there
[59:23] in Jesus Christ was Almighty God in
[59:26] human flesh but see in that same body
[59:32] was the pride of Jesus Christ waiting
[59:37] not physically talking come on God
[59:43] didn't want to just build a Tim build a
[59:46] body that he could come down and dwell
[59:48] with man he wanted to build a body that
[59:50] he could come down yes and dwell with
[59:52] man but then he knew the rest of the
[59:54] story that he was a healer or a savior
[59:55] or deliverer he wanted to come down and
[59:58] live in man why because he knew that she
[1:00:01] would be his body he knew that when he
[1:00:04] died the life would come out of him and
[1:00:06] go into the body you know the bride and
[1:00:08] to marry her forth as his body but that
[1:00:11] his flesh body would go through the
[1:00:13] throne and wait on the throne until
[1:00:15] witness is finished when this is
[1:00:18] finished on earth then we meet him in
[1:00:20] the air he raises and comes us away and
[1:00:23] we meet him in the air he didn't just
[1:00:28] want to just build a body for him to
[1:00:30] come and dwell in he wanted her body he
[1:00:33] could ground him but he wanted a body of
[1:00:35] people that he could dwell in that we
[1:00:39] would be his body
[1:00:47] 3:15 Philadelphian George but what is
[1:00:50] the temple of God Jesus spoke of his
[1:00:52] body as being the temple it was it was
[1:00:55] the temple of God but now that we are
[1:00:57] his body the true church is the temple
[1:01:00] of God by the Holy Ghost within us come
[1:01:04] on we are his body the page is unstuck
[1:01:18] taken from the statue of a perfect man
[1:01:20] this is number 5 what is the tabernacle
[1:01:25] now a body God tabernacling in a body
[1:01:30] then God was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:01:33] us in the form of Jesus Christ his son
[1:01:35] his creation then he become a dwelling
[1:01:37] place for God the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:01:41] cleanses us changes our nature by
[1:01:44] sitting upon us the Holy Ghost then we
[1:01:46] become into the divine nature of God
[1:01:49] then we become a dwelling place for God
[1:01:52] are you in come on look at this Ed
[1:02:00] forgot 75 look what is there know how
[1:02:03] that God is in his church the church is
[1:02:07] now supposed to be taking the place of
[1:02:09] God carrying on his ministry we don't
[1:02:15] need a body
[1:02:16] he's dwelling in you and me the new
[1:02:21] birth brings him into you and me but now
[1:02:23] here is the finish to come into this
[1:02:25] evening his message see it's not all to
[1:02:27] just become born again he wants his
[1:02:30] divine nature to come in to ever
[1:02:33] individual his divine nature is the
[1:02:36] statue of a perfect man it starts with
[1:02:39] the new birth come on we'll get to it
[1:02:40] this afternoon statue of a perfect man
[1:02:43] Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:44] comes upon you in the true baptism of
[1:02:47] the Holy Ghost and you got all these
[1:02:48] verts are sealed in you then God lives
[1:02:50] in a tabernacle called the building the
[1:02:52] living tabernacle of the Living God's
[1:02:54] dwelling place now this is a house that
[1:02:58] God dwells
[1:02:58] not a building with a big Bell on the
[1:03:01] top of it and a high steeple but a body
[1:03:04] has now prepared me a body that God can
[1:03:06] dwell in can walk in can see in can talk
[1:03:10] in can work in a men living
[1:03:13] instrumentality of God and God walking
[1:03:17] on two feet in you glory the footsteps
[1:03:21] of the righteous in ordered of the Lord
[1:03:23] come on
[1:03:25] attach to a perfect man 361 then the
[1:03:33] word coming from here manifests itself
[1:03:34] through each one of these beings see and
[1:03:37] makes his complete being a tabernacle of
[1:03:41] the Living God a walking living example
[1:03:45] of Christianity what Christ was these
[1:03:48] people are because his life is in here
[1:03:52] they are in Christ come on what is it
[1:03:56] building the tabernacle building the
[1:03:59] living tabernacle of the Living God's
[1:04:01] dwelling place the perfect man the
[1:04:02] living tabernacle of the Living God
[1:04:05] where he dwells the moons keep on
[1:04:10] reading and that's why I'm here this
[1:04:11] morning is to try to teach this little
[1:04:13] church paragraph 140 which would be
[1:04:16] number 9 how that we can become the
[1:04:19] dwelling place of the Living God how
[1:04:21] many here like to be that the dwelling
[1:04:26] place of the Living God we're not
[1:04:31] building an organization I'm not here
[1:04:34] this morning to build an organization
[1:04:35] Christ never sent me to build an
[1:04:37] organization Christ sent me to build
[1:04:39] individuals to the stature of Jesus
[1:04:42] Christ that they might be the powerhouse
[1:04:44] I am the dwelling place of the Spirit by
[1:04:48] His Word 3:41 then God lives in a
[1:04:53] tabernacle called a building the living
[1:04:56] tabernacle of the Living God's dwelling
[1:04:58] place we are his body he doesn't need a
[1:05:09] body right now on earth
[1:05:11] rota Brown says you got the body he said
[1:05:15] people who say I got blood I got this
[1:05:16] remember he said if you got the body you
[1:05:19] broke ever Scripture in the Bible come
[1:05:24] on cuz they were talking about literal
[1:05:26] things like blood and like things he
[1:05:29] said if you've got that you broke every
[1:05:31] script why cause we're his body he's not
[1:05:36] coming to earth he's going we're going
[1:05:39] to meet him in the air why because he
[1:05:42] would have two bodies God don't have two
[1:05:45] bodies he's got one body he said wait a
[1:05:48] minute God's got a body we got no no
[1:05:51] that's where you're looking at it wrong
[1:05:52] God came down and dwelled in a body and
[1:05:56] made way that you and I could have that
[1:05:58] same body why cause the Bible said that
[1:06:01] we'd have a glorious body white like
[1:06:04] unto his Lac unto his body what about a
[1:06:12] group of people walking on earth is God
[1:06:14] in human flesh see the new birth makes
[1:06:17] now we'll get to seen the new birth
[1:06:19] makes him a body to live in because he's
[1:06:23] living in you by the baptism of the Holy
[1:06:25] Ghost all right but to make it complete
[1:06:28] on earth he's got to come through these
[1:06:32] virtues to bring his divine nature into
[1:06:36] that human or that part body that will
[1:06:39] have eternal life the float and let that
[1:06:42] come out wordly into human flesh a
[1:06:48] dwelling place for God well I'll tell
[1:06:51] you what boy you really might eat that
[1:06:53] now because I can't even find this that
[1:06:56] you're talking about not sure think
[1:06:59] don't think that we could be the
[1:07:00] dwelling place of God will you tell me
[1:07:02] who is or what is or worriers or what's
[1:07:05] he doing you realize now listen this is
[1:07:09] the life statement I hope you get you
[1:07:11] realize if we're not the body of Christ
[1:07:13] on earth then he has no body on earth
[1:07:20] you don't listen come on he has nobody
[1:07:24] on earth because his body's on the
[1:07:25] throne that's according to the book now
[1:07:29] the book says that the Bible that his
[1:07:32] body is on the throne and that Bible
[1:07:36] says that we meet him in the air and you
[1:07:39] know what when we meet him in the air
[1:07:40] we've already been glorified all body
[1:07:43] spirit and soul to meet him in the air
[1:07:45] because that's the only way we can do it
[1:07:47] are you listening bodily form is what a
[1:07:51] title the message bodily form God
[1:07:56] forming himself in you and I the stature
[1:08:02] of a perfect man will bring his very
[1:08:05] nature he's being and all down into a
[1:08:08] human body that can bring that body
[1:08:10] under subjection no no no we can't never
[1:08:16] come under subject ours where he said
[1:08:21] now listen only in this with this
[1:08:24] statement
[1:08:24] you know God ain't expecting us to do
[1:08:28] anything now you you're gonna have to
[1:08:32] listen for a minute God's not expecting
[1:08:35] you and I to do anything except die to
[1:08:39] ourselves and let him come and live in
[1:08:43] us are you with me all he wants us to do
[1:08:52] is to get out of the way and let him
[1:08:55] come in set that way I can't do it I
[1:08:58] agree with you but if Christ can come
[1:09:02] and live in us he can manifest it
[1:09:05] outwardly and there's where you start
[1:09:09] your being of that body because that's
[1:09:11] your body your theophany your body your
[1:09:14] soul of what you are
[1:09:19] it's on the inside and all we got to do
[1:09:23] is get him outside but we're never going
[1:09:28] to get him outside being so beautiful
[1:09:30] well I don't see nothing I was thinking
[1:09:36] there this week
[1:09:37] Ryan dismay'd a little testimony there
[1:09:41] Wednesday night and then you know I
[1:09:43] don't talk lilulu testimony I mean he
[1:09:45] made our testimony about God in his ways
[1:09:48] I don't know where you listened to what
[1:09:51] he was saying he said that baby said it
[1:09:59] had seizures and he said we was
[1:10:02] expecting it we knew it would have
[1:10:06] seizures you know there was expecting
[1:10:09] not expecting like waiting on it to
[1:10:11] happen but what did he say so when she
[1:10:17] had the seizure and he prayed for he
[1:10:19] just walked off the platform I thought
[1:10:22] my goodness man he just got to the point
[1:10:24] to telling us what God was doing and you
[1:10:27] did walking off get back up here testify
[1:10:31] for an hour and a half come on because
[1:10:39] what he was simply saying was she's
[1:10:42] alive she's here God had delivered her
[1:10:46] and he he didn't put that in words he
[1:10:49] just walked off and left
[1:10:55] what God has done among us in this day
[1:11:00] is enough without having what he done
[1:11:03] with the Prophet and the things that was
[1:11:06] to his ministry and all of those things
[1:11:08] the things this little church has seen
[1:11:11] transpire well they they got it right
[1:11:17] over there - I like what brother faughn
[1:11:21] he said that brother Tim Humes his dad
[1:11:24] which was a wonderful old man I met got
[1:11:26] to meet him they were wonderful and he
[1:11:29] said that you remember if I can get it
[1:11:30] there's an executive anyhow brother
[1:11:32] Tim's they asked his daddy you know
[1:11:35] something about it he said how could you
[1:11:37] tell the difference between anointed
[1:11:40] ones and brother branham he said because
[1:11:45] you fathered that gift in other words
[1:11:49] the others could only come so far I'm
[1:11:53] getting in the best words I can they
[1:11:56] could only come so far because their
[1:11:58] anointing ones with our was in him there
[1:12:06] in him was God to manifest his death but
[1:12:12] you know what that was an example for
[1:12:15] you and I no no I know you you expect us
[1:12:20] to I don't expect us to do anything
[1:12:23] greater than he done I don't expect us
[1:12:25] to do anything greater than Jesus done
[1:12:26] but I expect us to do more oh you
[1:12:32] remember greater greater would mean
[1:12:34] we're doing something he couldn't do but
[1:12:36] more means he's come in to us to do what
[1:12:41] he wants to do come on because we're his
[1:12:45] body now can you hold on for a second
[1:12:51] then how does the seed come the natural
[1:12:56] birth of a child how does the seed come
[1:12:59] it has to come from the male
[1:13:03] right come on am i right
[1:13:07] the seed comes from the one no mayo why
[1:13:10] is it brother branham said that if you
[1:13:12] get anything you got to go to the body
[1:13:16] how come they couldn't get over that in
[1:13:18] the scriptures and getting it to working
[1:13:20] right in the book of Acts and they sent
[1:13:22] for a couple of guys that was original
[1:13:24] and when they got there
[1:13:26] it worked why because it was coming from
[1:13:33] the body maybe you'll see what we're
[1:13:38] talking about maybe next weekend when we
[1:13:40] get to that because the seed has got to
[1:13:43] come through the body and see if it
[1:13:48] comes to the body then you may have to
[1:13:49] worry about it being messed up if that
[1:13:54] seed comes through the body has come to
[1:13:55] them too right so there's gonna be the
[1:13:58] Bride of Christ
[1:13:58] come on musicians bodily form how do you
[1:14:06] get born again faith cometh by hearing
[1:14:12] your incomes by somebody preaching
[1:14:17] somebody bringing the word but I'm
[1:14:22] asking you this question before next
[1:14:24] Sunday can you put everything you've got
[1:14:28] I'm asking you now can you put
[1:14:32] everything you've got in all the hopes
[1:14:34] you'll ever have on the fivefold
[1:14:37] ministry you got a week to think it over
[1:14:44] can you put everything you've got on the
[1:14:47] five for ministry no I'll put everything
[1:14:49] I got on brother branham
[1:14:57] according to the Bible according to the
[1:15:00] Prophet the five whole ministries for
[1:15:06] the perfecting of the saints
[1:15:11] ain't gonna depend on nobody I've got it
[1:15:14] straight from the Prophet according to
[1:15:17] the Bible you just lied is that plain
[1:15:23] enough according to the Bible you just
[1:15:24] lied because the Bible doesn't teach
[1:15:26] that the Bible teaches is downward
[1:15:30] coming what God brought the word on
[1:15:33] earth himself decent of man brother
[1:15:37] branham come his restoration back to the
[1:15:39] word but who's going to be the word
[1:15:44] who's going to be the word I didn't get
[1:15:47] a clapping hand on that sounding like I
[1:15:50] got a clout back there for somebody
[1:15:51] doing something wrong well rid of God
[1:15:57] anyway come on George let Stan do you
[1:16:03] understand what I'm getting at I'm
[1:16:05] trying to get you to see who you are and
[1:16:09] what your purpose is of being here
[1:16:13] somebody is going to have to be it why
[1:16:18] can't we believe that we're that but
[1:16:24] you'll never get anywhere will you
[1:16:26] wowsie wowsie woo I just don't see
[1:16:28] nobody with it I hope you listen to what
[1:16:31] I say it 49 years in building the temple
[1:16:38] and every day they move stones and they
[1:16:42] worked and slaved and done and they're
[1:16:44] all walking around I don't see nothing
[1:16:47] going on except we're building this some
[1:16:51] kind of a building we don't even know
[1:16:53] what it looks like yet
[1:16:57] the church that's where we're missing it
[1:17:00] because when the building was finished
[1:17:02] was when the Shekinah glory comes when
[1:17:06] this statue of a perfect man brother
[1:17:08] Brennan said it I didn't he said it when
[1:17:10] it builds itself up into here he said
[1:17:12] the true baptism of the Holy Ghost if
[1:17:15] you read statue of a perfect man
[1:17:16] you might order to go back and read it
[1:17:18] again because if you'll read about half
[1:17:19] way through all the rest of the message
[1:17:21] you'll see him emphasizing over and over
[1:17:24] and over
[1:17:28] a statue of a perfect man when it's
[1:17:32] completed will be the one that goes in
[1:17:37] the rapture whoa what do you mean
[1:17:42] brother Dale oh oh boy to get believers
[1:17:45] go hey man I hope you're right there
[1:17:47] yeah all born-again believers Oh rapture
[1:17:51] so evidently brother Brennan must have
[1:17:53] been talking about something about the
[1:17:54] rapture a little different than our
[1:17:56] thoughts of rapture maybe he's talking
[1:17:59] about the one the Bible says that you
[1:18:08] will be changed in a moment in a
[1:18:10] twinkling of an eye there's a part of
[1:18:14] the rapture that you and I that are
[1:18:18] alive are going to have to experience
[1:18:21] here it's not D Christianizing all of
[1:18:25] those that have died and went on come on
[1:18:27] it's bringing it to the right place what
[1:18:33] do we got
[1:18:43] I can face to my bodily form
[1:18:50] [Music]
[1:18:52] it kept coming until he got what he
[1:18:55] wanted was a body to live in retrospect
[1:19:02] the father created that body according
[1:19:06] to the prophets message masterpiece the
[1:19:10] prophets milk that bodies the prophets
[1:19:16] wrote that body into being the world now
[1:19:24] you'll understand why I said Moses were
[1:19:27] told how to build it
[1:19:28] Solomon didn't have to be told he
[1:19:31] listened to Moses he could look out
[1:19:34] there in the shadows of the word he
[1:19:38] would build it the temple he could look
[1:19:42] at that tabernacle of Moses at beyond
[1:19:45] you're not paying attention
[1:19:48] [Music]
[1:19:51] Solomon looked after
[1:19:55] big
[1:19:56] but he bailed over here
[1:19:59] what had come forth and his
[1:20:01] understanding
[1:20:04] he never built its hidden endeavor that
[1:20:07] [Music]
[1:20:15] and one day that body was on earth that
[1:20:18] God could dwell in a human body
[1:20:20] but that wasn't all of it
[1:20:21] [Music]
[1:20:25] he wanted a bride that would be his body
[1:20:31] [Music]
[1:20:39] wake up jerk
[1:20:44] welcome to see what's taking place
[1:20:46] [Music]
[1:20:54] he holds my future and life is worth the
[1:21:03] living we call healing because healing I
[1:21:17] [Music]
[1:21:20] can face
[1:21:26] the coutny antibody delivers I have a
[1:21:30] body to live in he brought his body
[1:21:34] under subjection
[1:21:36] [Music]
[1:21:38] that's all he wants me and you to be
[1:21:43] it's come under subjection to that one
[1:21:45] that's within us is that a hard thing to
[1:21:52] do it is if we try to do it ourselves
[1:21:58] but it's not if we let him do it let him
[1:22:03] come innocently all I can face tomorrow
[1:22:18] be all it's gon be all I know
[1:22:38] he holds Church I hope you caught on the
[1:22:51] one a sayin
[1:22:54] Moses went to heaven and got the picture
[1:22:58] of what to do Solomon didn't have to go
[1:23:01] all he had to do was follow Moses and
[1:23:04] look and he said Darius he built it like
[1:23:09] that but it won't do no good for me to
[1:23:12] build a copycat or a picture over here
[1:23:14] to look like that he said I'm gonna put
[1:23:21] what's in my heart I'm gonna put what's
[1:23:26] in my heart over here cause Moses put
[1:23:29] what was in his heart over there
[1:23:33] they always build in the body everything
[1:23:39] had to match exactly then you take it
[1:23:42] you know you pull that pyramid and put
[1:23:44] it over there's exactly the same thing
