the eyes of my heart I want to see they men I want to see you to see you shining in the light of your glory we loving or out your power in love we sing holy holy I lived it shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and I want to see amen and amen and amen I want to see him don't you it's been a long journey of life and things but yet we've enjoyed it now coming to the end and I won't see him I want to see him good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like to follow along in the scriptures turn to first Peter 1 where we've been reading and then we'll go from 1st Peter 1 we'll go to Ephesians 4 and then up to fissions 5 amen remember each one of these remember the Bible study this coming Saturday 6 o'clock we've got that right for one time I'm doing pretty good for this month so remember that also pray for my wife she's going in the morning for the or tomorrow about lunchtime the laughter for her the biopsy to find out what our problems is so just pray that everything will be all right we believe that you know and I believe she's healed you know and you say well are you trying to convince yourself no I'm telling the devil did you get I'm telling the devil he'll be all right I'm not gonna worry about anything else I'm just talking to him so I'll hang around oh boy hang around I just remember that remember brother in Louisa's wife and them the family there and all in the burial and then coming back home and read the Lord we give them a safe journey all right before you see it I want to ask you a question this is just come on not part of the message but it is in the truth of the end of it but do you believe the promises of God are yin amen now that's according to second Corinthians one in 20 and his promises are yay and amen all right now the brother Branham said if you can find in the Bible a promise of God you can call him on the scene and said he has to fulfill it now listen this is what he said now what was the rest of that he said if he don't fulfill it you can call him a liar now that's strong in it well now that's what your prophet said he didn't seem to be upset well maybe I'll get in trouble saying is he he just said it he believed it you know what God come on the scene and honored a lot of things didn't so then we're not concerned about that but all right just remember that now as we get back to it in the message all right father we thank you for your grace and your loving to us thank you for the day in the time that we have thank you for you we ask you to come on the scene now and each and every one of us and open thy word unto us that we may see the day in the time that we're living right where we are in the Word of God thank you for your grace and your promises and just bless each one breast brother Louisa Newman our and family and burial and in the coming back home the Lord to be a hard journey so bless them and take care of them have your way we love you we thank you in Jesus name we've been reading this from first Peter for quite a while so we've shortened it up kind of safe too because we reading from the 23rd verse mainly but we read the 22nd verse the first Peter seeing you out purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever all right now let's go over to Ephesians 4 and start with the seventh verse yea but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith when he ascended up high up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same one also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ do we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge now that's till we come till means in other words that a specific stated point about the word till like we you say we'll do this until or something like that so you're setting us a space talking of the word till we all come of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with ever win why do you need these this measure of Christ why do you need this stature of a perfect man that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which ever joint supplies according to the affection other words got to be all together as one right according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh intercession of the body unto the edifying of itself in love now we pick up the verse 14 of the fifth chapter more for he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead in Christ shall give thee lot you may be seated to the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word what about coming to a time in the Bible to work that you can say we see this being fulfilled we see that being fulfilled we talked a lot about the worldly things you know and seeing Russia doing this China doing that and all of the things thinking there the other day as Wade was ministering see the seals reveal some natural things yeah but then they reveal spiritual things so we can stay on the natural that's all we'll get we would you see Russia doing this China doing that this happening there that happening there we don't want to stay with that we want to get into the spiritual side to see what that has to do with us now all right recognizing your day and its message our time that we are to be upon the earth all right now to give thoughts to that then think about the hour that we're living and to be able to read yourself right into that no all right no I mean you say well we believe the tower fell that was in the Bible okay it is it's there in the scriptures that when the towers fall then the light of the bride would be there the light of the Sun and the light of the Sun will be seven times that we believe that well you know what you could point to it and say that happened in my day you know you'd say well you know cuz somebody could stand and look and they say you know I was here when they created or put together the first automobile you know well you know that's a great you say well that's right there that's the very our well when are we going to recognize the very day and our that we're living we're walking one day at a time that's what I've been thinking sorry about that I hadn't priest in about I've been over three weeks I guess and so I'm feeling pretty good about it you know just keep praying for this little throat Satan keeps bothering me about it but it'll be all right all right but you know I've if somebody said said you you're through with your vacation I said yeah gotta preach Wednesday you know so that's good all right but think about it now think about the day and the hour that you're living because in the Bible now according to my understanding of reading the Word of God it of you know for all these years of studying it that the only person in the Bible that would ever amount to anything was someone who recognized recognized themselves as being in the word of that hour and time and is speaking of them right if speaking of them well when are we going to start doing that because until we it comes personal to us until it becomes a reality to us of what's happening in this day we are not going to be encouraged oh we can talk about it yeah we can say yeah one look at this enough but we already got that down or not thing about it you know instead of saying praise God we're here mean I mean you know you don't want to go and do things in the wrong form in mind but you know the Bible spoke of the tower falling which meant there were thousands of people going to die right well you say well we didn't want that no no no we didn't want that to happen but the Bible said that would happen and then we see it happen right I'm trying to get us to follow the seriousness of recognizing who we are and what's taking place all right because that'll bring us to a position then to follow in the day and to know where we're standing all right they knowing that it's speaking about us all right you know the old saying was they the the guy was getting a newspaper a day ahead of time you know and he he could just bet on anything or he knowed everything for whatever took place and all kind of things and boy he was doing really great until he read in the newspaper that he died that day before so that would do that well we don't want that see we don't want none of that part of it we want it but it just gets the story point to us all right now I'm gonna watch when we get if we get to the end if we don't we'll take up Sunday there in Ephesians it says a white thou that sleepest you know brother Roman said that was the bride you want it in there you want me to wait the later to quote it or bring it that's the bride asleep he said of being asleep it's not dead he said it's been asleep he said out there among that system even supplying our monitor 'yes except for whatever to that system and it says for us to awake no we'll get to that in a minute and then we'll get our our thought you'll see it Todd okay now what have we been doing we have reached a position in bringing the new birth I hope you followed that and to knowing for assurity to understand what the new birth is that it's the birth of the word the word that's been made alive to you what that God was going to send a prophet that was his new birth right when who was it which one was it system ET that was questioning God about what are the Mary brother branham or not and what was what happened behold i send you elijah the prophet well you know what she just went married him well you know she she believed God and God spoke personally to her and seemed I had the Prophet alright now why does he went over and said bill something spoke to me and told me that I'm supposed to marry Elisha the prophet where can I find him do you know anything about where he's at you know your spiritual man and in a great man of honor and now could you help me find Elijah no not quite alright yeah so follow the talk now we've talked about the new birth as being the birth of the word the word that you've took and and the born-again experience and how did each age had that new birth every age down through their head to new birth each one of them had to birth through the word and their experience fit the same as to all ages because it was the opening of God's Word to them and their their evidence was the same of the Holy Ghost for every age because it was what now what is the evidence whether or not the spirit in you can agree with a word so that would be forever church age forever individual all right now see that way we can find ourselves in the Word of God in the hour all right to know now listen this is going to be a surprise after a while when we follow something I thought into the message if we have time because see that birth brought you into the body of Christ alright that fulfilled Jesus in tech and talking to Nicodemus and telling him you must be born again he couldn't understand that but they did understand it when the Holy Ghost fell under their penticoff and it brought them to a position that they themselves saw something personal now what if you were standing there are sitting in the upper room and the Holy Ghost was falling and you you you said well it's not only so I guess it's not happening well I don't think that would have stopped God from fulfilling his word to you I think he would went right ahead and fulfilled it with all of our unbelief and things course we know we wouldn't have been in the room but still the point all right now so we come to that part of talking about the born-again experience the Prophet would say statue a perfect man how faith and be born again all right how faith and be born again he said cause the faith is the foundation and he said the foundation of all Christianity is based up on faith and what is faith faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen faith is a revelation from God to personally to you that's why you new birth his revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally that he's speaking to you all right now we should recognize that and say thank you Lord for seeing what the new birth is we may have been thinking maybe some thinking of well I thought the new birth was this I thought the new birth was that I thought it was crying I thought it was shouting I thought that's the after-effects that's not the birth all right so maybe that's out of the way now that we can follow that line and that thought and what not that's not D Christianizing are doing away with anything we believe that a still birth is a dead baby all right so we know that there was no new birth in Christ that was a dead baby it's all alive in its depart for the day in the hour that we're living all right now maybe it meant nothing to you I'm not saying that wrongly I'm saying that you're putting it back into your lap as to think about it see you'd say well what do we need to know about the new birth you know well I remember the Prophet said there in one of the statements we were given he said another word talking about the Holy Ghost he said it's been so missed out you know or incorrectly taught and he said how can you if you don't know what the Holy Ghost is something to that degree he said how can you know you got it welcome it is it's a very vital thing to know what the new birth is and see then anybody that ask you you can give Alma a statement my new birth is the birth of the word that God has revealed to me and that is my eternal life well and then the rest of my life our birth is being born again and climbing up the pyramid coming out to the place that God can live in my heart as he wants to and the day that we're living all right now white kind of you know brother Nathaniel is they didn't know too much about what was going on the other day but I'm glad Nathaniel was here one thing I enjoyed what he had to say you know enjoyed the message - it took a part off of me of having to preach as far as the coffin and the things and that helper so that was a part and you know but see I I didn't need to preach the message that it was going to preach see I needed to wait till tonight all right now I'm gonna read and you can believe what you want to or think well you did hear I didn't add any more I added one quote into these notes from almost two weeks so when I get to reading these notes in a minute and some of you've got them and you already seen that Wade gave these quotes Sunday so you're gonna catch on to what's taking place all right now then that'll that'll bring it to a point that we could understand all right but now my approach is to try to get you to see one thing that the new birth is the birth of that word that you heard making you alive in Christ giving you eternal life all right and it comes out to be that it's word added to word as a growth development in Christ all right now we lost down through time the ability to achieve unto the part that Peter was speaking off of the statue of a perfect man now you probably won't agree with but I thought you had listened we lost that part of understanding what it would be to be the stature of a perfect man alright that's been my whole point to try to get us to see alright we that was lost through the ages but to be restored by the last day messenger to bring it to that place that somebody could attain unto that position alright then in doing that then we follow the simplicity of the Prophet and as I said a moment ago then we come up to the point we should have reached it by now that we can look at all of the things of life and time and usually everything aside and simply think about that that new birth being the birth of the word that you have faith and be born again alright now we read in 2nd Peter or then it says what you've escaped the corruption that is in the world and the time and who is that written to those that are in Christ Jesus all right it is not written to the world to try to give a growth development you got to get the person born again first all right see the person has to be born again before they can start any kind of a growth development in Christ alright so it's required that we receive that new birth all right in that new birth is what gives us eternal life all right then the Prophet come to bring us the message how to attain unto the stature of a perfect man how that it would be word upon word line upon line here a little darling fulfilling all of the Scriptures to point down to her that we would be in the restoration in our day all right now as I tried to bring out some things from it what I see most people have today in the message that I've listened to the people and you say well who are you well that's okay who are you so we just solve that problem and we know it's worth nothing I'm just talking trying to get you to see something go see what what you hear among most of the ministers of this message is a message of reformation is to stopping this and stopping that and don't do this and don't do that and in trying to get people to work in that room of getting saved and all I can't and that's well and wonderful it's got to be done but if you bring a band through Reformation you're not going to bring him to a new birth you're gonna bring him only to his thoughts and ideas of how that he is a Christian all right and I'm talking about all over looking at the rims of mankind in this message outside the message everything that mankind has come to a point looking at it it's the most religious day that has ever been right I mean you got more billions of dollars being spent around the world in Christian hospitals and schools and etc right and you said what brother Dale that's a wonderful thing I'm not against that I thank God for that all right but is that the Christianity you know I mean is that too Christianity that we are to bring to the people or it is is it the birth of the word that God has given unto us for us to walk into that word and say thank you Lord we come to Reformation but to most people's I think Reformation is restoration it is not reform is to just change you from this to that stopped you from being an alcoholic but leave your tobacco holic you know what I mean is that right now that we come through those days and churches that we seen preachers preach against drinking we get the old one outside and smoke the well you know what that is that's rough Meishan it's trying to get you to change from one thing to another it's not a new birth experience to take care of the desires of all the things of that you know to word that like brother Tom fob which I remember he prayed a prayer to God about the smoking and just a lot of you know for certain smoking is a hard demon to to get away from all right and he said he prayed and said Lord take away the need and the desire well he said I never desired another cigarette he said it never did desirable but you know yourself you've been through it a lot of youhow did you throw them away pick them back up throw them away pick them up you you you fault that demon over and over because you didn't know maybe the route of room to fight with but yet you you've done that see a lot of that is carnal reform Reformation just changing you from one meeting house to another take your hat and coat as brother Mark said moving him this building to that building and say I'm a Christian alright we'll see we're supposed to be trying to get to restoration alright restoration means to restore back to something that was previously there alright the disciples had you read the statute perfect man so you know the probably said he said the disciples had these virtues all right see then Peter was trying to tell the people how to come to the place of those virtues okay and when it did see then we're gonna get to like knowledge in a minute I mean uh not today but we're gonna get to knowledge and to think about how could you come up with all these doctrines that's in the message if you got Holy Ghost knowledge now that can't be holy ghost knowledge that brings you to any other thing like my wife and I were talking today about things and see you would you would say what so-and-so this or that you know would happen well what if you had a dream and laid it out and you had this dream and in this dream you wish to get this and you was to get that and and you was to inherit millions of dollars and and you as to to really come forth you know as a great person and on all the world etc and I like that right and then in that dream after the dream was had I was trying to explain something to her about this like who was it Joseph Smith but rested I don't daddy had a dream but he said what he said it wasn't of God well how was he to know how was he to know he didn't have no profit to go to with it to straighten it out what was getting at brother Branham had to dream you remember when he was at Jeffersonville in his home and everything now in the dream we remember when they plowed up the trees and the rocks and things in front of his house and he come back in his dream well he grabbed that guy he hit him and knocked him down well the guy kind of moved on from said something he grabbed him up hit him again now that was the dream right but God spoke to the Prophet he says now when this comes to Pais by Pais this what was he to bypass hitting the guy right come on be sensible he was divided by hitting the guy because he wasn't supposed to hit the guy but in the dream he was shown that he'd hit the guy twice well yet see he was a prophet that could come forth all right see like I've seen about you you could have a dream you could have this for a vision and see all these great things what if at the end of your vision and you saw it come to Pais you remember in the Bible if a prophet give you a sign and there come to Pais and he take you to another God now what are you gonna do get up and tell the dream I told you all I was gonna get this I told you all I was gonna get that I told you this was gonna happen I told you that was gonna happen all of that happened to the tee all of you agree then it happened exactly the way I told you it says now we need to believe in a Trinity what are you gonna fight with give me your dream see it's very vital to know what the birth of the word is it's the birth of that word that will keep you from following after wrong doctrines and ideas all right it had to be restored because in time it was eaten away of the perb I mean the part of the statue of a perfect man to be able to achieve unto that position and it would come forth as a babe in Christ and have to grow into those things but we should be to the basis that it should be in our day that we're through with that baby stuff we should be able to check everything by the word you say well brother day elders and mean times if you told us this and will we tell it to you one more time brother how do you check anybody's word that they bring or a message I check it by my own experience who are you maybe we're yeah come on I'll check it by my own experience well because if my experience is according to the world if this has brought me to one God and the truth of understanding of God in his ways and then you come up and give me all of these other visions and dreams and life but that takes me to another guy what am I supposed to do I know what the Bible says I'm posted but heaven help us we need to bypass it you know what the Bible says to do your son if he prophesize a lie kill him is that Bible since the kill him now let's bypass that okay you see what I'm getting at you can say I've got all of this with all of that but there's some of it don't fit in there exactly right but we've got to have a prophet so the Prophet gave us the message what was his message it will read and we've read over and over and over what was his message Malachi 4 turn the hearts of the endtime fathers to the message of the hour of what we thought see is the double part back there and come on over here okay what is it to do what was this message to do turn our hearts back to the faith of the Father what is the faith of the father it's the revelation of God's Word what's that in a minute now what is the faith of the father's it's not just to say well he's supposed to turn back to the statute of perfect man now he's to bring the entire Bible right the faith of the fathers is to bring the entire Bible because they were the writers of the Bible agree and as they were the writers of the Bible then we would turn back to the entire Bible not to just the statue of a perfect man now when we read in a minute the Prophet said that he's revealed he turned her hearts back you need to reveal the thunders which is revelation 16 and to be these divinely revealed mystery truth that literally do that all right now that is the only way I want to Scripture I want the Prophet you see that's why people don't like me better way but heaven help us when are we going to stand for what we believe show me any other thing that can bring the faith of the Father than what the Prophet said it well when we can do this we can do you know better than that you can't do it you got to come the way he said it right all right so then what does he start off by doing now to try to shorten I the end ago he says add to your faith he doesn't say Peter never says add faith show me the scripture you don't say add faith faith is the birth you don't add to birth faith is the birth faith is the baby here right and the baby has all the parts that it has need of so you don't add any parts to complete the child you just simply add food for it to grow up as we read in Peter there to grow up in him all right so there's no such thing as add faith faith is the birth faith is your experience in God to give you the new birth which is the birth of the word aren't then he said then add to your faith remember it's your faith what did brethren say about that this is my God gave it to me it's my the new birth is my new birth God gave it to me there was no way I could get that without God so your faith according to Black's famous names what now your mental faith becomes a spiritual revelation now you've got to Bertha mental faith is not the birth a mental knowledge of the word is not the birth of the word the birth of the word is when the word is quickened in your heart is made alive what is the difference between the Bible you read today and the Bible you read in the Baptist Methodist Presbyterian etc I've never seen any word that the words changed right now you can change by picking up all these good news isn't modern man and everything but you know what I'm talking about we don't go with stuff like that we just going with the truth all right but see it says add to your faith add virtue well now how are you gonna get virtue that was where we ended up it was where we stopped on our thought how are we to get virtue it okay the simple question I asked 19 and 80 I mean 70 running over 71 how do we get these virtues you've read the book what the broad runs say well we folks out verse so we'll just have it now how are you going to get and wildest let's do this let's do it this way you know what brother Brown calls all of those things in the stacks of a perfect man virtues well he said you know knowledge and all like that temporally he says those are virtues now what's he talking about he done told you it's not a virgin life hmm we'll get to that as we go along but have you sleighing that out to you free to think huh see now how are we going to get you how we're going to get knowledge we just read a lot more that would be known as worldly knowledge and you profit said statue a permit this is not worldly knowledge and see I know what your thoughts on a lot of things are and you have some thoughts that are good and I'm not discrediting the thoughts but some of you think well I could have brotherly kindness up here before I get virtue down here hmm all right all I'm asking there simple explanation how'd you get up there he's saying you don't have brotherly kindness I said you don't have knowledge etc what I'm saying it can't be done that's your knowledge that's your virtues that's your thoughts don't go up a ladder and skip a bunch of rungs that don't work now it may with you that you think well I just come up here I just will see that's what people say people of the message say I've got brotherly kindness because I was born in this age of Lady hacia so that means I've got this and I've got love because I was born in this age well so does Adolph Hitler the brother Dale you're disgusting to use things like that I'm trying my best to get you to think we can't climb up a ladder and jump up and then skip a rung get all the knowledge you can read all you can read every day study every day listen to tapes every day get all of that knowledge into you that you can get cause it'll come in handy but it will not bring you virtue and virtue has to come before knowledge can come now are you following me the first thing we need is to talk about virtue well how do we get virtue well I don't let me jump up one let me start on knowledge go ahead but I say to you without any remorse of any thoughts for any point of backing up from it it won't work it'll bring you to head knowledge it'll bring you to wonderful thing praise God for head knowledge that's what people's always been against me on their sake our brother Dale just an intellect well there's one thing about it if I've got the seed in the field God can do something with it what's the matter will you bunch of junk that ain't got the seed in the field you played around while I was studying God's Word at least I've got a foundation for God to quicken what can you quicken on you that's out there here wherever it goes but listen we have to grow into the statue of a perfect man do you realize by saying what I'll do brother Dale out its work on brotherly kindness well that'd be a good thought we need to we're always working presently kinda but you know what I mean now obvious I to get Burt brother kindness first well you know what that would kind of do in in you're thinking of the baby did you understand what did you say it then you'd be whacking the baby and - here standing with the legs and jumping him up to hit hop and nothing in between you following me nothing in between so that won't work let's get that out of the way don't even consider talking to me about well I think I've got this that or the other I told you the only thing God ever spoke to me about the statue of a perfect man he said if you'll have patience with the people that it'll prove you have patience well I'm my patience is pretty thin and has always been pretty thin so I don't worry about telling you about but listen how do we come in to these virtues how do you grow as a natural child you grow by eating the word you grow by eating the Word of God so then it's wonderful to have had knowledge because at least God can quicken it well I'll just sit down here and wait on God I've got it now listen Suzie we use these times we know how to quote brother Branham brother Brown said one day if I have a need garter put somebody on the pulpit the full feeling I agree with that 100% but if that's what you're waiting on I don't agree we if you're waiting on God to put somebody on the pulpit to do it I don't agree we this prophets message has already been brought are you trying to look for something else to happen you're in danger is over the getting caught in the trials because he'll put up these people on the pulpit that'll say things that really sounds good you came all right now as we approach this thought that we've read over and over and over 327 go ahead and pull up number one I want you to think a simple little thought the simplicity of thinking in the human mind it's to think about when a prophet would say and tell you how to attain unto something why would you want to find other ways to attain right what would be the problem what would be the point we asked the Prophet brother Branham what is the new birth crossing mister God revealed he says revelation Jesus Christ personally that's the answer what are we doing with the message I thought the message was the answer to our questions I didn't know it was your ideas and mine and yet you have people you know yourself the Prophet said it blasphemous names and cry and the statue a perfect man that a people have a portion of these virtues and not even born again would you remember what he said that was he said that was like a peacock putting butter and feathers in and hollering I'm a peacock now I didn't say that your prophet saw and said it so read the message huh brother Branham how do we how are we to come to the stature of a perfect man we know we can't depend upon mankind to bring us these things we must depend upon the Prophet to bring the message right we can't depend upon thoughts this is what I think it is I liked that one huh I know I'm hateful and arrogant oh dude you know you talk to people in there say watch your input right what's your input here's what the Prophet said that's my input so you say what's your input meaning what's your thoughts I didn't know that we had any talks I thought we were supposed to cast away our thoughts take what the prophets say it and believe it could you see our life depends upon it oh yeah we like to take marriage and divorce and read it we like to take uh you know different messages and read because of what we won't the Prophet to say but can we take the entire message of what he said well I've always been open to you you think I'm off the message come to me let's talk about it but no you won't do that you'll go to others and talk about well that's according to the Bible a schism in other words you don't realize that's the devil in you doing it because I'm open up enough to let you know I've always been open if I'm off the words come show me but don't come in will it rather there I think it's so entitled bring me what the Prophet said or the Bible says and let's go from the dark is that being sarcastic all right now if we approach this to read about it where the Prophet will say that that will take these divinely revealed mystery truths to literally turn our hearts back I want you to think a little different than what your thoughts is playing in your mind and has been playing for a while well let's understand of elation cleaning for seventh seal that's true that's true now but if the Thunder is the revelation contained in the seven seals and the seven seals is the entire plan of redemption is that true yeah I'm asking you to make your statement the seals is the entire plan of redemption to mankind so the seals is revealing one guard water baptism no eternal hell all of these things that's what wage doing see coming back from the natural to go to the spiritual coming from the white horse rider of the literal part of the seal as be in that system this dark and then bringing it over on to the side where you're at in the white righteous church that is really the righteous church and then bringing it down to simplicity of talking about justification and the blood the blood the in sanctification and see that in that blood of the natural is the killing of the people that's not to seal that's what happens in the natural the seal is the Holy Spirit taking off over here to reveal the blood of Jesus Christ and how wonderful and marvelous it is to sanctify some senators aside for those are you following the message like that well I just don't understand what you why he's going you know you're trying to figure it out just listen Agro asked him a question I mean he's like I am was it they don't bother me so I can't say what in the world are you talking about don't bother me hmm but listen so then what you're talking about how will we come to the statue of a perfect man the faith of the fathers not to just know what the seals are not to just know Daniel seventy weeks not to just know this or that or the other it's no the entire revelation of Jesus Christ from the entire Bible are you listening the entire Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ is that true artificial revelation of Jesus Christ then he's going to show us how to come into these virtues by being a partaker of himself not to just know the seals or to know this or to know that I've never talked nothing like that your prophet that's what's so amazing in the sealed that's where he loses the people they're wanting to know what the first Celia and then look into something they finally zero it down and they get it on the Antichrist and he goes and he's done gone any ain't talking about Antichrist no more he's talking about Jesus Christ what I'd like to know what that first seal is I don't mind telling you brother Mohit I wanted to get that seal book so bad when I first heard he started introducing the message to me and I heard about them sealed I know old man they say we knew a little bit in the Bible just a tad bit and I wanted to know what no seals were he said you ain't getting the book he said you're gonna read this message this message this message then you'll get your church age book and said when you get to church age book and finish that church age book I mean have you ever read the church needs book maybe two three days pretty good book honey oh it didn't take me no time cuz i standing there with my hand i okay you promise me where's this seal book he said okay here take it and read it I mean if you heard me say this I'm honest to tell you I read to seal book I enjoyed the great things that were brought out and there were things way beyond what we'd ever even considered or anything of what it was but when I finished the seals and reading that seal book I was just as blind and and ever thing is I was when I started other than some wordings and thoughts and ideas you know what I doing I like to see a book down I went back to the church age school and I studied that church age book dissected it over and over and all I could get a hold of and talking to him about the thing you know it was probably six months maybe a year forever picked up silver because the I knew I didn't know what I was talking about I knew I didn't understand what in the world he was saying called one minute he had a seal as being a Antichrist in a situation of this are the second seal that blood and him killing and all I got in it in a minute he was talking about sanctification how did he get from there to here and he's he he spends 10 minutes telling me what the natural seal is and 45 minutes or an hour and a half telling me what the spiritual part is I thought well when we get up to set with I will have a little better understanding boy he blowed me from one end to the other and I had a decent memory and a decent understanding of the Bible yet I was so lost that I didn't know what in the world a man was talking about it's not elated outside and I went back to what I could understand then after a while I seen that what he was doing ten minutes to talk about an antichrist the whole thing was to talk about Jesus Christ and I saw then we were trying to figure out the seals as to what they were naturally you gonna you're gonna get to a good enjoyment pretty quick because see there's only four seals to the early journey of mankind only four seals to the earthly journey of mankind you better better start realizing get on spiritual what are you talking about what are you saying I'm saying this point that the entire Bible is what we have need of not to just know the seals and the layouts and the things or the trumpets and the vials and the plagues oh you go haywire getting into Feast of the trumpets you want to get into Feast of Trumpets for a few minutes and quote brother Branham until a great man in this message he said he made so many slips for the tongues and that he said you can't even follow any McCain understanding and he said in the message it was thus saith the Lord but I heard the man himself he said you can't understand what he's talking about look down I thought what in the world this God hmm but listen jerks I'm talking about the revelation what's going to bring us to the statue of a perfect man well Lula Church knows about the seal so we got that we got that now boy we got the sealed but do we have this message do we have the life of the message so you understand what I'm getting at I know I'm just gonna get this point in deny that's okay we've got to understand the entire Bible the entire Bible of the revelation of Jesus Christ is what's going to bring us to the statue of a perfect now you go read your ears almanacs and the things you know and you read all the other things and don't read or listen I'm not against that if you don't like to read you can listen but it's some way get to the message you ask me well what message should I listen to well listen to this that little all right I do the best I can trying to lay out ahead of time but you ought to be so point to work that you're glad to listen to any message don't worry about it your prophet is going to bring out things in the 50s that are very valuable to understand in the 60s and there's not no such thing in our thoughts our doctor and her idea shouldn't be that brother Branham up until 63 couldn't be trusted the son of man had to come in straightening my arm you had never heard that same way you've come from some of the places and been around the place is your to hurt it sorry it's true listen it's the entire Bible that is going to bring you an eye to the statue of a perfect lamb it's not to just say brother Dale should we read this seal book should we just stay in the seal book and keep reading it will you need to write but don't forget the rest of the message and after all the said and done don't forget the Bible you know don't forget the Bible I hope it gives you a thought where you can understand because we read this quote many times you know it'll be these divinely revealed mystery true we'll see you think well I've got the seals so I got the seals I've got the statue a perfect man mm-hmm yes when God adds these things and remember are you listening remember this statement there is not but one new birth right but in the statue of a perfect man you've got to be birthed into each one of those virtues so that gives you seven new births not saying seven new births like you got to go to the altar and have a new birth again it's a seven verse of the word it's the word being birthed into you and I there's one new birth that brings you eternal life though this brings us growth development just as it does for you to eat a seven-course meal you start off with a baby you don't give it a seven course meal you don't even give it a one course but after a while it does get to where you can feed them a little bit I think it's time that you and I should be able to settle down and eat the Word of God it doesn't bother me for somebody to come along and preach error no because I'm not afraid of the Holy Ghost is within me the one that has protected me all of these years I'm not afraid of him letting me get caught but you know what he is the only one that can tell me what the word says it's exactly right that we need no man teachers because the Holy Ghost will teach us that's exactly scriptural but then we take it we don't need teachers we don't need that that any what it said he's talking about that nobody can teach you it takes the Holy Spirit to teach you I thought we believed in adoption has to be in the tutor that the Holy Spirit was our tutor to direct us hmm sees that a way if you understand what I'm getting at listen it doesn't mean we all have the same understanding we're building a body of Christ we each one have our measure we read in in Peter we each one have our measure for the part that we are the children have their part are measured unto them according to their ability and there's people that is we're not all on the same level how would you have a body if you had everybody on the same level but we need to be at least on one thing they're all eating the same food as we always say yeah I love a good steak that's good they had an opportunity tonight and brother and sister took me and my wife out for her birthday one said order anything you won't I said I won't this page in this page in this page he said I'll pay far thank you you know what I wound up eating a salad and I enjoyed it right not got what I wanted hmm you see that's the way it is in the Word of God that's why the that we don't reject something but we don't need to know them things that's that's that simple stuff back there that simplicity might be what's keeping us from coming to the virtues where you following me so now let's read this statement with a with an understanding go ahead and pull number one back let's read it now remember we're asking the Prophet brother Branham how are we to attain unto these virtues and what were these virtues bring 2pi makes 327 lady you see in church age church age book now this messenger of Malachi 4 in Revelation 2:10 7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi for he will turn the hearts of the children to the father's icesoft there's what he came for read the book and see if he didn't say Lord fill me up with these things that I may teach others to bringing these things into the body of Christ he knew what he was to bring the faith of the father the revelation of the father's Laura now you understand why I was saying about the Bible you realize the Bible was written by those disciples you realize that was God speaking through mankind to bring to you and I his word but it'll take the same God revealing that to you to bring you and me to a virtue one according to Malachi 4 you turn the hearts of the children to the Father now look at him number 2 he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals what are the seven seals the entire plan of redemption so what did you do he'll reveal the mystery of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelation attained in the seven sealed and once it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truths the seals that literally turned the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so so how are we to attain unto the stature or a perfect man what would these verses so witness how virtue will look up what virtue means and we'll we'll get over brother so-and-so somewhere and we'll find something that Charles Larkin or this guy or that guy or Billy Graham or they're all Roberts or something talk about virtue Evan happy I thought we believe God sent a prophet to us I didn't know that he sent Billy Graham or Robertson etc to us to change us I thought it was the messenger of Malachi 4 I thought he was to bring the bride to the revelation of Jesus Christ I thought it'd be so much until he would be pointing to the skies and to return of Christ talking about the bride I thought it'd be him that would bring us to the revelation of God's Word you see that's why I asked questions it's a brother Branham what is the new birth there's so much confusion about what this isn't that it what is the new bar it's a revelation in Jesus Christ personally do you alright I've got the answer the answer is always in the message I never will forget we were standing in a church one time and we had changed the dates of a fellowship meeting the only one time we done it some we will remember we don't hit one time for the people and we don't hit for the deer hunters because of the time fell on exactly the time of the opening of the of the deer season so I got to okay to change it and this brother oh he was really so nice you know he came up he said where was you at last week brother day I said I don't know what I think what do you mean well you wanted to meet and change oh okay I'll tell you I didn't go hunting I didn't want it for me cuz I wouldn't even go in anyway I said I didn't know honey it's a cold I didn't care he said well what if the Lord had come life week rat darn the fellowship meeting and took us out of here ice ain't got no problem well what would you doing I said I got no problem I got the profit so what you mean you got the profit I said according to what my profits saying he said I'll meet you on him game trails that's exactly what he said now you arguing I'll find you the quote he said I'll meet you on him game trails I said where would I being I'd have been better off than you I'd have been on the game trail when brother looked at the other said I told you not to ask him cause he'd have an answer why answer within the message okay but listen it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the pentecostal fathers now this is the only thing I've ever said about it why are the people of this message so taboo about the seals and don't want to know what they are when your prophet said that was now you find me another one you find me another place that he says some other way to get the virtues and I'll be glad to come here put it on there put it on the internet and be glad to tell you who told me that I've been around too long you can't find it there's your only hope of the virtues it can only be done by the opening of God's word the virtues can only come into being because of the opening of God's Word how does the opening of God's Word come by way of the profit so we're turning down the very thing did he say head of course I become your enemy because I tell you the truth of what he said he says on Daniel seventy weeks he said if you don't understand Daniel seventy weeks you cannot understand the seals of all the plagues or trouble that's what he said you need that be glad to find it for you but if you get you Daniel seventy weeks book and over the front page you'll find it right there it's in the book of course what you're saying to a lot of people see like I said they don't even have the book you can say oferta but I don't have a book but you have to know all about the 70 weeks they know all about the seals and never read the book well I just stand where I did 40 years ago to say the same thing how do we get these virtues it's by the opening of the Word of God which is the seals that Daniel seventy weeks all the things you don't have to understand all of the things you don't have to understand the Daniel seventy weeks as to why this fitstar this but you got to understand one time that what he was saying is what God gave the people now he says on Daniel 70 week that God put it on his pen to write it and he says six or seven times there's one week left after the rapture but yet you've never read the book but yet you'll go to the other quotes and the seals of this or that or the other and try to quote something that's what I'm driving that church yeah but you're making an arrogant to me because I'm it was an arrogant suppose you would just be coming in to mention if you walk in and say brother Dale what do I do to get these virtues I just heard you preach a message I heard the Prophet said we got how these verse how do I get them and then I read you a quote of how to get him that won't some other way like a brother said that time to brother mode he said I meant how many messages you preached on that statue or preventing so about 65 he's ain't got time to listen 65 tapes my mom said you've been listening all these other times and then got nothing yet he was a little more blunt than you need to hold the truth but you see God has given us the understanding how to come to the stature of a perfect man he's given it to her but why would we turn it down I mean I'm honest if you told me so will brother Dale it's the thunders which is revelation contained in the seventh seal well there's one thing for sure I'd want to read you see look I'd study that seal book until I could know every page and every paragraph and what was said on each one of them because that would be the way yeah but nobody knows what this is and that is too late for me to cover a lot of things now let me preach a second but nobody knows who this is or the seals are and the thunders and the thing well if the prophet told us and I preached it with a challenge I'm going to read here in a minute where the Thunder is the voice of God when the seal broke now I want you to show me there's something else I'm up for correction I want you to show me where it says it's something else you see Church we tried to block it all off and makes other people responsible and problems because if we don't understand and then we say what I just can't understand brother Dale what don't you understand I asked a simple question how do we get the statue of a perfect man you've definitely been through the message you're supposed to then of listening a reading of the statute a perfect plan can you find anywhere in there a way or a channel or a thought to bring those things did brother Branham put it down there now to get virtue we need to do this to get knowledge we need to do there to get the patience we need to do that yeah matter of fact he made it look worse than what we could ever think about but for him to make a simple statement this profit was to do two things turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Father that was what he came for right then to reveal the seven thunders which in Revelation contains and he said it'll be these to finally reveal mystery truth these thunders is what's going to turn us back what's eating brother Dale none of us know what the thunders are if the prophet said it's the voice of God then what right have we got to say anything else right I mean give me a reason for saying anything out they listen go ahead we'll try to do a few anyway go to number two you know where he's taken from on the first seal and he's taking it from the scripture where Jesus was standing there with him and he said it he it thundered but he knew what it say it right they said it thundered but he knew it was the voice of God the thunders a voice of God you don't know what a thunder is let's read it so he's using instead of I heard they said it thundered then when the lamb took the book and broke that first seal God spoke from his eternal throne to say what that seal was to be revealed God spoke from his eternal zone then brother Brennan said Jesus is out hearing God speech you want to know what it is we read it but when it was placed before John it was innocent when John saw it was still a mystery why he wasn't even reveal right then it cannot be revealed until what he said here at the end time but it coming our symbol you realize that if it had been made known back dark you and I wouldn't be here oh I never thought of it like to have you and I wouldn't be here okay all right when the Thunder remember a loud clapping noise of a thunder is the force of God that's what the Bible said see a clap of thunder they thought it was the thunder but it was God he understood it for it was revealed to him see it was a thunder and notice the first he'll open the first seal when it opened in the symbol form it thundered now what about when it's opened in its reality for whites just finishing up parts of those things you'll listen revelation 6:1 there's one thunder in seven seals broke profit goes to Tucson Arizona it was one thunder one black but he never knew what the first seal was when he was out there now that's his words or else you're making him a liar so go ahead because he said I don't know what the first seal he priest God his simplicity he preached the breech and he said I don't know what the first seal is well he just done that wouldn't you just go ahead and pittypat all you want to in your little brain because you're not influencing me none I'm listening to what he said he said he was took over and I'll be glad to show you that he was took up out there and told to come back to Jeffersonville say it'll be totally you want to do that's what it was told him out there come back to Jeffersonville one thunder what is it thunder it thundered as soon as the lamb struck back to seal and what did the veal not all of itself it thundered the voice of God he thundered on Mount Sinai but the people didn't understand the voice of God sounded on Mount Sania I'm reading the prophet but they didn't understand you see a thunder can go off and be the voice of God but it takes a prophet to know what the thunder is all right brother branham what is the thunder what is it Thunder brother branham what about it go to number three first seal all right and a thunder went off John knew it was the voice of God and then the line like creature says come and see what is the voice of God Thunder is the voice of God see if we'd have been standing there that day we would have heard boom bloom bloom bloom bloom but he heard God speaking to them he told him you know this is mine that's not the one over on what he told him who he was and what he was doing so now listen go ahead the number three or that's one we don't going to number four the first seal now let us find the symbols we found out what the Thunder means that's perfectly we know that the thunder was the voice of God when the seal opened one happen out dirty come back there's one sound but there was seven seals to be broke now I didn't say it he did he said I don't know what the first seal is and he said on the first seal I would have made a horrible mistake today if the Holy Spirit had not come and corrected me on something that I was going to write or to say but the thunder was the horse of God Jehovah thundered on Mount Sinai and divorce of God the number six voice of the Thunder the voice came from war from the throne where the lamb had left just left its intercessor and he's standing here now to take the position and his claims but the Thunder came from the inside of the throne thundered out and the lamb was standing out here well the lamb is God that's true but there's a voice a prophets got to tell you what that is I promised you I wouldn't leave this dangling so I'll go go ahead number seven back up on this in the message Sunday and look what he says revivals that were supposed to have we have denominational revivals we haven't had a real steering no no no no no sir don't think we got revivals we haven't oh they got millions and millions and millions of church members but not a revival and over the bride hasn't had a revival yet see there's been no revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet we're looking for it it will take those seven unknown thunders back dark to wake her up again he will send it he promised it was he was dead I think the next quote would it wait doll that sleepeth next quote number eight I don't believe that God is calling owner to the fall time to repent in this verse he's talking to the his elect they have some repenting to do many of his children are still in those false churches there are those of whom it speaks in Ephesians 5:14 awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead in Christ shall give thee light to be asleep is not to be dead these are sleeping amongst the dead they are not there they are out there in the dead denominations they're floating along with them God cries out wake up repent of your folly here they are lending their influence giving their time and their money actually their lives to these Antichrist organizations and all the while thinking it is alright they need to repent they must repent they need to have a change of mind and turn back toward the truth I'll recap that and review it awake thou that sleepest according what he said in the sale book and take the thunders to wake up the bride no now we're standing on the verge of one thing as the thunders sounded if they have we have a capability of coming to the Statue of a perfect man if the thunders had not sounded we do not have an ability to fulfill those scriptures so it's up to us to find out where we stand it the thunders the force of God from the seal breaks oh yeah but that's different from this one is it the Thunder is the voice of God so wait thou that sleepest the President on asleep and awake um I mean the message we're sleeping in slumber and if we don't know where we're at and until we know where we're at come on musician until we know where we're at and what's taking place and begin to realize the day in the hour that we're living we are still asleep we have not been woke up by the seven unknown thunders I'll review these Sundays so don't worry about it the prophets said the bride hadn't had a revival yet he said he'd take those seven unknown thunders to wake her up but brother Dale ain't gonna be no more world wide sweeping revivals nobody said anything about it he's talking about a revival for the bride he said the bride he is the world the next world wide sweeping revival is the two witnesses to Israel right am i right but you know we're supposed to be in a revival of the word that's why I've always told you I don't back up don't steps from the day I entered this message and begin to see it I've been in the greatest revival that has ever been in the world because I've been in the basis of the opening of the word because I refuse to just follow abandon their ideas first message I preached here July the 4th 1971 was going beyond man's camp and I said this then and meaning it still today I said you cabbage down and sat down on the message and claiming that this is this and this is that but I said get out of the way because we're going on going beyond man's camp nearly 50 years or still standing and saying the same thing you see I have a revival when God speaks to me when he tells me something I'm revived you don't think of it like that we're not supposed to have a worldwide sleeping revival right but whoever done away with a revival to the bride now let's see because you ministers and once done it you makes it revival to the ministers of this message didn't listen to him revivals over brother Branham said they hadn't had it yet he said it'll take him seven unknowns understood wake her up for a revival he said she was dead out in sleeping in in denominations and needs to be woke up a revival is promised to the bride a revealing of God's Word don't worry about it the Prophet said it'll come because it's promised after the door the Gentile churches closed God willing on the church then and he'll do in one year or what theologist tried to do in 2000 he said but he's doing it now are you not happy in your soul for the word that you heard are you not happy for the things that God has spoken to you about or are you still thinking well you know I'd still be back there and I'd be doing pretty good you know you'd still be asleep a revival to the bride and the world will never see it God is not farthing he promised a revival for the bride now you show me were it came and has ended I'll show you where it came and show you that it is never ended that's what's going on now maybe it'll encourage you to read and study and listen to your prophet because you see he's the one that has the answer a revival to the bride prophet said he promised it and he'll send it but who's gonna be listening for I don't believe there be another revival I don't either not the way you're talking about cuz they'll never be another sweet world wife sleep in revival the next one is to the Jews but why can't you believe that the day that God spoke to you and showed you water baptism that that was a revival in your soul why can't you believe when he showed you one God and begin to give you understanding of those things that that was revival in your soul can't you believe that when he showed you that the new birth was a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you why can't you see that's a revival in your soul when he showed you the seven thunders would be the revelation and attained in the seven seals and it would be these divinely revealed mystery truth that literally turned our hearts back that don't make a river Havel I go every day looking Lord what else now well you want me to bring next because I'm just waiting on you ain't waiting like you wait I ain't down into our port waiting on the bus right I'm trying my best to be at the place I'm supposed to be and then he can move on to say are you expecting a revival bro Dale little run said they'll come such a baptism of the Holy Ghost that will fill every fiber of our being and take us in the rapture what are you expecting I could stand here till midnight talking about the things that I'm expecting they see I don't worry that's what brother we'd been a bunch of years ago and the ministries meeting who is having they said their sign brother Dale atopic he can speak because they couldn't do it I've never had one thing and that's God's gift you tell me what to preach and you call the scripture let's see if God can do it that makes an exalted state no no that makes how much confidence that I have in God that I don't care who I preached before or what I do I preach what I believe and I'm not afraid of anything I just tell what I believe and why I believe it cause it's in God's Word why shouldn't we have the answer to all the questions that's what used to get me years ago somebody say something about answer to what brother Branham said be wire them and how to answered all the questions Conn the phrase beware of them that don't have no answers at all that right women women you sisters should know this message enough until you could sit down and explain things from the message because what have you been doing all I supposed to do was how babies good for you I hoped and pray to God that's true but I'll remind you of a lady that had 17 kids I believe that's right in John Wesley's mother 17 kids and she had all of the washing to do didn't know washing dry
