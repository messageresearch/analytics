[18:33] I want to see

[18:42] you want to understand him you just said
[18:44] that you said I want to see him well
[18:47] you'll see them in the word today if
[18:48] that's what you wanted I know that sure
[18:51] it's because you love him things
[18:53] anybody ever once get brother Joe
[18:55] something give him a zebra pen he must
[18:57] eat him I don't and they're hard
[19:00] stainless steel I don't know what he
[19:02] gets out of it but he loves those things
[19:05] but good to be in the house the Lord
[19:07] gonna be back could see smiling faces
[19:10] we heard some good word while we were
[19:12] gone and we're gonna continue to do what
[19:17] we do and try to help you help you learn
[19:21] about the Lord a little bit more I was
[19:22] thinking you know these it's the
[19:24] fivefold ministry in the fivefold
[19:26] ministry they got different angles to
[19:27] come the same way so we we believe that
[19:31] you're not gonna get it without it so to
[19:34] me that's pretty cut-and-dry you're not
[19:37] gonna get perfective without a fivefold
[19:39] ministry so if you believe in anything
[19:40] else you're not gonna get it it's just a
[19:42] way then i turned the fan on this
[19:44] morning the thing that is still a little
[19:45] warm though but yeah okay if you got
[19:48] your Bibles let's turn to the Book of
[19:49] Revelations and just get started we are
[19:51] still on the fourth seal this will be
[19:55] part three I will restore in four stages
[20:01] because we're on the fourth seal I told
[20:03] you there was some fours that we need to
[20:04] look at so the fourth seal it even talks
[20:07] about the fourth part of the earth
[20:09] falling for Satan's life so we're gonna
[20:12] kind of look at the four stages today
[20:15] and in the Bible and also in the
[20:19] prophets message so if you would let's
[20:22] bow our heads and we'll get started the
[20:25] Lord Jesus we thank you for this day
[20:26] Lord we come under complete anticipation
[20:30] that you'll speak to us that you'll move
[20:35] us out of the way and as we were talking
[20:37] in this Bible School downstairs Lord
[20:40] this morning just let us be a conduit
[20:43] Lord let nothing stop in our human brain
[20:47] Lord may it all go straight to our heart
[20:48] where we can hear from you Father
[20:51] you'd be the one that does the speaking
[20:53] father you'd be the one that does the
[20:54] revealing because there's no way the
[20:57] human mortal man can reveal or even
[20:59] understand your word
[21:00] it takes a complete revelation from you
[21:03] Lord we ask you to be with us now Lord
[21:05] and take care of us during the further
[21:07] ment of this service bless the ones that
[21:09] are not here bless the ones that are on
[21:10] the highways traveling the ones that are
[21:13] away from us Lord the ones that are sick
[21:14] we actually do to heal them now father
[21:16] as the word goes forth
[21:18] you said you sent your word and healed
[21:19] the people and you delivered them from
[21:21] destruction so father we believe that
[21:23] it's not just something we quote we
[21:25] believe that as this word goes forth
[21:27] there's healing power their salvation -
[21:30] this word Lord there's healing there's
[21:31] deliverance all the many things that we
[21:34] well honestly we wouldn't be here Lord
[21:36] if we didn't think it would help us amen
[21:38] we we believe that you're here to help
[21:41] us we believe the word that's going to
[21:42] help us and we believe that as the
[21:45] brother said the other day we are going
[21:47] to either leave here better or worse so
[21:49] let us all leave here better today Lord
[21:51] knowing that you spoke to us this
[21:53] afternoon father
[21:54] bless us now take care of us Jesus name
[21:57] we pray amen revelation 6 verse 1 and
[22:02] when he had opened the fourth seal I
[22:04] heard the voice of the fourth beast say
[22:06] come and see and now looked and behold a
[22:08] pale horse and his name that sat on him
[22:10] was death and hell followed with him and
[22:12] power was given unto them over the
[22:13] fourth part of the earth to kill with
[22:16] the sword and with hunger and with death
[22:19] and with the beasts of the earth that's
[22:22] four things if you'll notice that sword
[22:23] hunger death and with the beasts of the
[22:26] earth so we're going to kind of deal
[22:28] with force today because I will restore
[22:31] will be in four stages joel 2:24 tells
[22:35] us this now here's the here's the here's
[22:39] the set up to me for the end time
[22:42] because you and I are truly the children
[22:45] of Zion now we know this is talking to
[22:47] Israel but we get it first if God
[22:51] doesn't restore a work in us he's not
[22:54] gonna go to Israel no ma'am alright but
[22:56] so he is going to be glad then you
[23:00] children of Zion who's glad today who's
[23:02] glad who's rejoicing today
[23:05] well then let's put the scripture
[23:06] together and rejoice in the Lord their
[23:08] God for he hath given you not the
[23:12] neighbor he's giving it to you he has
[23:14] given you the former rain moderately not
[23:18] just in dribbles moderately because you
[23:23] know you can have a you say well oh Lord
[23:25] reigneth storm them no you don't want
[23:28] that you can't handle it
[23:29] he knows what you can handle you can
[23:32] actually drown a plant by putting too
[23:33] much water on it he knows what you want
[23:37] and what you need and he puts it
[23:39] together for you so he's gonna give you
[23:41] the former rain moderately which is what
[23:43] the teaching rain swine took sixty years
[23:46] since the prophets left took for us to
[23:48] break the word down so that we can all
[23:50] understand it man cuz you didn't
[23:52] understand it in 1965 if you were even
[23:55] alive neither did I and we're just
[23:58] beginning now to learn what the Prophet
[24:00] came to do
[24:01] amen and he came to give the word to you
[24:04] and I to get us out of here and he will
[24:07] cause to come down for you the rain the
[24:09] former and the latter rain in the first
[24:13] month all right so it's gonna be a quick
[24:15] work the former rain is what teaching
[24:19] rain latter rain is the harvest rain so
[24:22] we're now in the harvest time and then
[24:24] and what happens about October we'll get
[24:27] into this in a second what happens in
[24:28] about October the life starts coming out
[24:31] of the plant goes into the root and then
[24:37] so that you can harvest because if you
[24:40] harvest in it with the life in the tree
[24:43] or plant you kill it amen but when the
[24:48] life goes down you can harvest it but
[24:52] we'll get to that because remember I
[24:53] will restore though I will restore to
[24:57] you verse 25 100 verse 24 and the floors
[25:00] shall be full of wheat wheat staff of
[25:02] life something you can eat and the fat
[25:04] shall overflow not just dribble not just
[25:07] sprinkle but overflow with what wine and
[25:11] oil we know what the wine and all is
[25:12] right the wine is the stimulation of
[25:15] Revelation and the oil is the Holy Ghost
[25:17] all right
[25:18] he's gonna pour out the Holy Ghost
[25:19] moderately in the end time feed us with
[25:25] wheat and I will restore to you the
[25:29] years years 2000 years I will restore to
[25:35] you the years that the locust has eaten
[25:36] the cankerworm then the caterpillar and
[25:38] the Palma worm my great army which I
[25:41] stood among you and you shall eat in
[25:43] plenty and be satisfied and praise the
[25:48] name of the Lord your God that has dealt
[25:51] wonderfully with you and my people shall
[25:55] never be ashamed you may be seated in
[25:57] the Lord at his blessing to the reading
[25:59] the word Windigo needs we're not gonna
[26:01] need the chart today we're just gonna
[26:02] kind of we're gonna review because it's
[26:05] been a few weeks but we know we're on
[26:06] the fourth seal and the fourth seal has
[26:11] a great meaning to me because it should
[26:13] have a great meaning to you because the
[26:14] rapture takes place on that fourth seal
[26:16] alright that alright say ma'am all right
[26:19] we're gonna try to all stay awake today
[26:20] hey man hey man okay alright so let's
[26:25] read what brother Branham says on the
[26:26] fifth seal we read it a couple of weeks
[26:28] ago but I want you to see this what a
[26:32] prophet told us what was going to happen
[26:35] I'm going to set this box up here to
[26:37] represent that if God sends a certain
[26:40] spirit among them that's the only thing
[26:43] that they can work by okay so Martin
[26:46] Luther had a box the just shall live by
[26:49] faith that was his message not
[26:52] sanctification not the other message he
[26:56] had a message and that people lived by
[26:58] that message if God sends a certain
[27:01] spirit among them that's the only thing
[27:03] they can work by is the spirit that
[27:05] works among them now will prove to you
[27:08] by the history of the church and by the
[27:09] opening of the seals so must be by the
[27:12] opening of the seals we see what each
[27:14] box is what each power that was given to
[27:18] the church and how that Satan eat the
[27:20] power down because remember if you
[27:24] restore that means it was up here it
[27:29] come to here and then you had to restore
[27:31] it back
[27:31] redemptions not replacement Redemption
[27:34] is we were lost now we're going back
[27:36] amen
[27:38] I will restore him that's what he's
[27:40] doing right now every time you come into
[27:42] Church service every time you read the
[27:43] Bible every time you pray he's restoring
[27:45] it back to the condition that it was
[27:47] supposed to be in and we will prove to
[27:50] you by the history of the church and by
[27:52] the opening of the seals and the powers
[27:53] that let loose and watch exactly the
[27:56] church respond to the anointing and they
[27:59] couldn't do nothing else all right so
[28:02] you and I are under what we're under the
[28:04] eagle anointing let's read them let's
[28:06] read number two I'm just kind of review
[28:08] a little bit for you we're in the fourth
[28:11] seal but it's the seventh Church age now
[28:15] what you've got a chart I gave you all
[28:17] the chart you should all know that we
[28:19] are in the last Church age then and then
[28:22] notice the four beasts that was sent
[28:23] forth to come forth beasts that was set
[28:26] forth to combat the Antichrist and this
[28:28] last beast are you ready
[28:29] the last beast that was sent forth or
[28:31] the last power to combat the Antichrist
[28:33] who was against the teaching of God the
[28:36] Antichrist was an eagle see the fourth
[28:38] living beast was an eagle now you just
[28:40] study the age you study the scripture
[28:41] it's an eagle and then the Bible the
[28:43] last age was an eagle age and God likens
[28:45] the Eagles to his prophets now watch the
[28:47] last days the Eagle age a revealer of
[28:51] the true word now remember it wasn't
[28:53] that they had false word and so much it
[28:56] was all false no there was a little bit
[28:58] of truth they had their box Martin
[29:01] Luther had his boss God said all right
[29:02] and you start with the just shall live
[29:04] by faith I'm gonna anoint that save a
[29:08] group of people but that group of people
[29:12] he's gonna have to live under that the
[29:16] whole age then you got your lap overs
[29:18] because then you come to sanctification
[29:20] they quit going to pubs and drinking
[29:22] beer and and you know even Martin Luther
[29:24] said he wanted to get rid of the Jews
[29:25] said they were worthless people when
[29:27] that was you know what that wasn't God
[29:29] that was Martin Luther and then that was
[29:31] that was Martin Luther's idea that
[29:33] wasn't God's idea amen but the just
[29:36] shall live by faith that was God that
[29:39] was the quickening that God brought to
[29:41] Martin Luther God knew Martin Luther was
[29:43] the only one that can handle that
[29:45] give it to somebody else same way we're
[29:47] brother branham in the Eagle Age there
[29:49] was no one built to take that except
[29:51] William Marion Branham the only one to
[29:53] take that pressure but you know what in
[29:58] him taking the pressure he opened the
[30:00] skies so that you and I could take the
[30:02] pressure he opened up the revelation
[30:04] showed that you and I we don't have to
[30:08] we don't have to look to he wasn't
[30:10] talking about mama Eagle being him mama
[30:14] Eagle was God
[30:15] mama eagle was Christ still is Christ
[30:19] and that's who he pointed us to a true
[30:21] prophet will always point you to Christ
[30:23] never to himself but now what do we do
[30:26] is man we pointing to William Branham no
[30:28] you can't do that you'll lose every time
[30:31] amen revelations 3:14 let's look at what
[30:34] our what our age gives us into the a
[30:36] angel the Church of the layout of sins
[30:38] write these things saith the Amen the
[30:41] faithful and true witness the beginning
[30:43] of the creation of God look at those
[30:45] fours the Amen the faithful the true
[30:48] witness the beginning the creation of
[30:49] God I know that works the tower and
[30:51] neither cold nor hot I would that work
[30:53] cold or hot so then because thou art
[30:57] lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will
[30:58] spew thee out of my mouth because Dow
[31:01] says he didn't say that Dow says I am
[31:04] rich and increased with Goods and have
[31:05] need of nothing and knowest not that
[31:07] thou art wretched and miserable or blind
[31:09] and naked I counsel thee to buy of me
[31:11] gold tried in the fire the telling us be
[31:13] rich and white raiment that thou must be
[31:15] clothed and that the shame of thy
[31:17] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[31:19] eyes with eyesalve that they may see
[31:21] that now that's our anointing so God has
[31:25] sent that to take care of all the things
[31:28] that he said before that we were blind
[31:29] miserable and wretched and miserable and
[31:31] naked and don't know it
[31:32] as many as I love I rebuke and chasten
[31:35] be zealous therefore and repent behold I
[31:38] stand at the door and knock If any man
[31:39] hear my voice and open the door I will
[31:42] come in to him and will sup with him and
[31:44] he with me
[31:45] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[31:48] sit with me in my throne even as I have
[31:50] overcome and I'm sitting down with my
[31:52] father in his throne he doesn't have an
[31:54] ear let him hear what the spirit saith
[31:56] unto the churches all right so everybody
[31:59] okay with that that's where we come up
[32:00] to the anointing of what you're sitting
[32:03] under right now not another age not the
[32:07] age before they're norming we're sitting
[32:09] under right now is that anointing that
[32:11] we're talking about but he's going to
[32:14] restore by of me I said buy of me these
[32:18] things buy of me gold it's something we
[32:21] have to do because when we come out of
[32:23] the church age we know that church age
[32:25] is going to go through all these but you
[32:27] and I are called out of the age but now
[32:29] sure it affects us amen it affects us
[32:31] we're all affected by the by the
[32:33] Laodicean Church age but we don't have
[32:35] to be of the Laodicean Church age we can
[32:39] live in the Laodicean Church age but we
[32:41] were called out just like all the other
[32:43] bride was called out of every church age
[32:45] so now let's go back to this and read
[32:47] revelation it's going to want you to
[32:48] remember a few things and then we'll get
[32:50] started this is just a review from what
[32:52] we read the last time and when he had
[32:53] opened the fourth seal I heard the voice
[32:55] of the fourth beast say come and see now
[32:57] what was that fourth beast ego you can
[33:01] participate you know what if you'll talk
[33:02] back to me you won't go to sleep what
[33:05] fourth beast was a and I loved him
[33:11] behold the pale horse that was a pale
[33:14] horse and his name that sat on him was
[33:16] death
[33:16] so remember he got a name and hell
[33:19] followed with him and power was given
[33:21] unto them over the fourth part of the
[33:24] earth to kill with a sword hunger death
[33:27] and with the beasts of the earth all
[33:30] right so that's your that's the
[33:32] anointing under the revelation 6 and we
[33:35] had opened the fourth seal verse seven
[33:39] and eight there's your fourth seal now
[33:41] we got to remember to scroll it on up
[33:43] all the way oh what it will remember
[33:48] keep this in your mind as we're going
[33:50] through the fourth seal here are our
[33:52] keys in the fifth seal we are not here
[33:56] in the fifth seal there is nothing to
[33:59] the Gentiles it is it actually it goes
[34:03] into another dimension there's another
[34:07] dominicos in I saw the souls under the
[34:09] altar will the souls on the altar or not
[34:11] here
[34:12] they're in another dimension alright
[34:14] then alright say ma'am
[34:15] alright so now here's the keys to what
[34:18] we need to look for because if the
[34:20] rapture takes place in the fourth seal
[34:21] and brother Dale was hitting on it this
[34:23] morning some death has to be destroyed
[34:26] a resurrection has to take place and a
[34:30] rapture takes place on this seal so
[34:33] guess what there's a group of people
[34:35] comes to the statue of a perfect man
[34:37] there's a group of people that comes to
[34:39] a place to where death doesn't have a
[34:41] dominion over them anymore under this
[34:44] fourth seal when we see a break for us
[34:47] we see a rapture so we must see the
[34:51] perfection of a bride in this fourth
[34:53] seal that's why I was telling you he
[34:56] must restore now sure he started
[34:58] restoration way back a man he started a
[35:02] restoration way back but remember even
[35:05] when you come to the fourth church aids
[35:07] now not the fourth seal the fourth
[35:09] Church age they wet in the ground they
[35:14] went in the ground they didn't though
[35:16] the word was eat down by this we're
[35:18] going to get to in just a minute it went
[35:21] in the ground but have you ever thought
[35:23] about this though let's get to these
[35:26] symbols and then we'll then we'll get
[35:27] started cause if something we want to
[35:28] want you to see that's really kind of
[35:30] interesting the symbols then is a pale
[35:32] horse what is the pale horse Red Horse
[35:38] white horse black horse mixed together
[35:43] and it's a putrid pale greenish gooey
[35:47] globby there's nothing good to look at
[35:50] and then and we now know that his name
[35:53] is death it what it didn't mean that his
[35:55] name wasn't death back then
[35:57] it's just now he's been revealed he's
[35:59] been made known in the apex of Satan's
[36:02] domain we should know the only way
[36:05] that's going to be destroyed is is when
[36:07] Satan comes I'm gonna read your
[36:10] scripture in a minute the prince of this
[36:12] world has come and has nothing jesus
[36:15] said nothing in me so if the bridegroom
[36:19] gets it then the bride is supposed to
[36:22] get it amen so pale horse named
[36:25] death here we go again power was given
[36:28] to that person and then a fourth part of
[36:32] the earth was deceived now we know more
[36:35] than that is but it had to start
[36:37] somewhere a fourth part of the earth and
[36:39] that fourth part of the earth now is 99
[36:42] percent of the earth right but it had to
[36:44] start somewhere
[36:45] a fourth part of the earth fell was
[36:47] Satan will read that in a minute because
[36:49] remember under this sealed the prophet
[36:52] of God said under this seal Satan's cast
[36:54] out of heaven you know where he comes
[36:59] we know he was cast out way before and
[37:01] he came down here and he's been in doing
[37:03] his work but he's got to be cast out of
[37:05] me and you he's got to be cast out of
[37:08] this church amen
[37:12] all right let's read the next one and
[37:17] you know what it happens you saw Austin
[37:20] impossible it's just an impossibility
[37:22] you need to start become a believer
[37:24] first once you become a believer then
[37:28] you can't believe what God's already
[37:31] said about you not what he's going to
[37:34] say listen this Bible is not this Bible
[37:37] is not going to be rewritten the Bible
[37:43] is going to be lived that's the problem
[37:46] is we got a live dead letter but it's
[37:49] not dead the good because I'll prove to
[37:53] you in just a minute
[37:53] all them bugs eat eat eat eat eat but
[37:57] they never got to the root jesus said I
[38:01] am the root and offspring of David
[38:06] you'll never get to that because like I
[38:10] said before what about what about in in
[38:12] November when it gets really cold if all
[38:15] the trees still have leaves and fruit on
[38:19] it it's no good the Treo die leaves to
[38:23] fall off and then and the fruit of rot
[38:26] so God knows what he's doing so when we
[38:29] come down to the latter reign of the
[38:30] harvest reign the harvest comes in
[38:33] October somewhere in there you know
[38:34] about coming up this time of the year
[38:36] Natan in a couple of months but what
[38:38] happens is the
[38:39] life goes down into the root and they
[38:42] harvest it look this is the fourth seal
[38:48] notice they find that this fellow here
[38:50] is an eagle that's what I was just
[38:51] talking about this man that are this
[38:53] living creature that's poured forth here
[38:55] now
[38:55] or in other words there's four different
[38:57] ages of it there was an age of the line
[39:00] we find out being the fourth age he said
[39:02] come and see the fourth mystery is what
[39:04] I want you see the fourth
[39:05] mystery of the book of redemption that's
[39:08] been hidden in this book it's still
[39:12] talking about redemption because look
[39:15] let me be a real frank with you
[39:18] and then when this fourth seal breaks
[39:20] redemptions over they were always saying
[39:23] redemption was over in the seventh seal
[39:25] redemptions over on the fourth seal for
[39:27] the Gentiles
[39:28] hey man redemption is over because we
[39:31] can't go in the rapture unless
[39:32] redemptions over and then so we'll come
[39:36] and look at the fourth mystery of the
[39:37] book of redemption that's been hidden
[39:38] this book come see John went to see and
[39:40] he saw a pale horse and again the same
[39:42] rider upon this pale horse now he has a
[39:45] name called death all right let's go to
[39:48] the next now notice none of the other
[39:50] riders none of the other horses are no
[39:53] time that this rider ever rode that man
[39:56] had no name because you know what let's
[40:05] just be real truthful there was people
[40:08] in the Catholic Church that got born
[40:09] again hey man Martin Luther was a
[40:14] Catholic he still had the ideas of the
[40:18] Catholic Church God birthed them under
[40:21] the just shall live by faith which
[40:24] brought them out people were mourning in
[40:28] under Baptist faith a presbyterian faith
[40:34] a Lutheran faith amen
[40:38] but there was no further for them to go
[40:41] but God knew that that's okay he put him
[40:43] away a man hit him you know put him in
[40:46] another dimension waiting on who waiting
[40:51] on us
[40:52] that the full words come and then we
[40:54] come out of all that we come out of all
[40:58] that sure we had these different ideas
[41:00] we all did and then even though you
[41:02] didn't have an idea of a Baptist or
[41:04] Methodist Presbyterian Pentecost or
[41:06] whatever you still had ideas contrary to
[41:07] God amen but now he's called death it's
[41:12] not mentioned he's revealed now what he
[41:15] is death
[41:16] well how we linger on that for a sermon
[41:19] and make it real plain but anything
[41:20] that's anti that's against a real has to
[41:23] be death because there's only two
[41:25] subjects life and death that's it
[41:29] amen and that proves that the Holy
[41:33] Spirit revelation of this in this day is
[41:36] exactly the truth why because it's
[41:40] showing the anti the Antichrist is
[41:42] riding away the Anti Christ doctrine is
[41:45] being made known and being what pushed
[41:47] out and that proves that the Holy
[41:53] Spirit's revelation of this and this day
[41:54] is exactly the truth the anti he's death
[41:57] because the word as we'll see later here
[42:00] is life see and this man is called death
[42:03] let's go to them go and read the other
[42:05] one get it get these four done and then
[42:07] we'll now look the fourth seal now it
[42:13] was not mentioned other times of this
[42:14] rider but since not now it's mentioned
[42:17] that he's called death but under the
[42:20] revelation of the line now watch I want
[42:22] you to read this close so I'd be sure
[42:23] wrote down to place stand here in other
[42:26] words he whatever he's writing said stop
[42:28] and tell them what's going on not under
[42:31] the revelation of the line age now look
[42:33] the line age was what know what don't
[42:36] you see the revelation of the line age
[42:38] was all these faith of the fathers God
[42:44] working the little nod from God right
[42:51] but he went revealed exactly who the
[42:54] Antichrist was amen they were still a
[42:57] little something I'm telling you right
[43:00] there now under the revelation of a lion
[43:01] age of the first age early age this
[43:03] wasn't revealed
[43:06] the next stage was the age of the arts
[43:09] because remember in the first age we
[43:11] didn't go through it we're going to go
[43:12] through it now I've kind of left it off
[43:13] until now that it becomes a what saying
[43:16] a deed a doctrine incarnate are we going
[43:21] to look we're gonna see false prophet
[43:22] we're going to see incarnate false
[43:24] prophet we're gonna see all that just in
[43:26] a minute okay but you see how it started
[43:28] so innocent then it wasn't even call it
[43:31] an antichrist
[43:32] until what until John went to Patmos and
[43:35] saw Antichrist and come back Paul said
[43:39] Grievous wolves what is he saying
[43:40] already among you it's death grievious
[43:45] wolves have come and one of the ones
[43:47] Grievous wolves did they what kill you
[43:51] the next stage was the age of the arts
[43:54] which is the Dark Age the middle age it
[43:56] wasn't revealed as it that's what it was
[43:59] nor the man-like beasts of wisdom
[44:01] representing the Reformers Luther and
[44:03] Wesley and so forth it wasn't revealed
[44:05] but in the Eagle AIDS the last days the
[44:08] prophetic age were there is to rise
[44:10] prophetic utterance to whom the secrets
[44:15] always comes now folks huh I say that's
[44:20] me and you we must under we have we have
[44:24] we are born under a prophetic utterance
[44:29] brother Branham said I now call you
[44:31] bride he separated that church and bride
[44:33] he separated it so much he said I now
[44:35] call you Brian
[44:36] well that's prophetic utterance nobody
[44:38] had ever said that Luther never come out
[44:40] and said well now there's a bride and
[44:42] there's a church no he was just a church
[44:44] Wesley was just the church the Pentecost
[44:47] was definitely just the church the
[44:49] church this and the church that Oh
[44:51] everybody called themself bride but they
[44:53] didn't know what to do they know how to
[44:56] handle the Word of God but in the Eagle
[44:59] lays the last days the prophetic age
[45:00] where there is to rise prophetic
[45:03] utterance where did you ever see anybody
[45:05] come together like brother Branham
[45:06] didn't and aside from the discernment
[45:10] because that was a different gift
[45:13] hello brother branham said dad he said
[45:16] this was what bait on hook this is the
[45:22] hook the bait on the hook was the signs
[45:25] and wonders that's the hook the
[45:28] revelation what to catch the trout
[45:32] so you see brother branham he comes any
[45:34] put-put statue a perfect man together
[45:36] puts Daniel seven new weeks together the
[45:39] seals come together all these different
[45:42] things that brother brown them he he's
[45:44] the prophet he can turn a corner he
[45:46] build a building
[45:47] none of these others could do that you
[45:49] know what they weren't required because
[45:50] it wasn't in their box it wasn't in
[45:54] their box to see that then you come to
[45:57] the next and the next and next but when
[45:58] you come to us it's in our box it's a
[46:02] requirement for us to see these things
[46:04] hey man it's not a requirement just to
[46:06] live a good Christian life well yes a
[46:11] requirement but in this age we were
[46:17] required to sit with Christ in his
[46:19] throne and folks that's Incarnate God
[46:27] because it's not you and him and God
[46:30] sitting on a throne because that's
[46:32] Trinity it's not you and Christ sitting
[46:36] on the throne that's two lords that's
[46:43] telling them downstairs you know we got
[46:45] this joint our thing down yet we ain't
[46:49] got this year gods
[46:50] we ain't got this come from God went
[46:53] back to God we ain't got all that down
[46:54] yet but we're getting it we're getting
[46:56] it
[46:56] I think we're getting it all right let's
[46:58] read number five on the fourth seal he's
[47:02] still talking look see the writer the
[47:03] first place as an antichrist
[47:05] he was death to begin with but he's so
[47:08] innocent then
[47:10] well my he was so innocent that when he
[47:13] come in let me tell you how innocent
[47:15] this was when he comes in with a father
[47:17] son Holy Ghost baptism
[47:18] everybody except there are no sure there
[47:22] was a few my mean of my newphew that
[47:26] didn't accept it but most people 99% of
[47:31] the people in the religious world
[47:32] accepted that doctrine and you know what
[47:37] God had to wink at it he winked at it
[47:38] cuz everybody accepted it
[47:40] amen but now watch see look that's not
[47:44] in our box it's not in our box to accept
[47:47] that we've been told the truth father
[47:52] son Holy Ghost might have been okay
[47:54] in Pentecost and Luther and Wesley but
[47:56] now he requires all what all to repent
[48:00] repent of what repented of repent of the
[48:02] things we thought before that's what I
[48:05] have to repent of my ideas but he's
[48:11] innocent then then he received a crown
[48:13] what they voted a Pope in and come in
[48:16] with Constantine put a pope in a triple
[48:18] one and when he did then he United
[48:22] Constantine broke church and state
[48:24] together Satan United his church and
[48:27] state because he was over both of them
[48:30] then Antichrist was Satan in the form of
[48:34] a man now then when we find out this
[48:37] mystery here in his church and state the
[48:40] fourth stage of his ministry he's called
[48:42] the beast first he's called the
[48:44] Antichrist then he's called false
[48:46] prophet and called the Beast now we find
[48:47] him being called as the beef now watch I
[48:50] want you to watch though what he brings
[48:51] the four in though that's just three
[48:53] once you bring the four now I want you
[48:54] to notice that after the fourth horse
[48:56] and in this fourth horse if you'll
[48:59] notice the first one was white the next
[49:01] one was red in the next one was black
[49:03] and the fourth one all of these other
[49:06] three were represented in it because
[49:08] pale is red and white and so mixed
[49:10] together because you know if you dig in
[49:14] deep there's only justification
[49:16] sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost
[49:17] but there is a pummel worm and locusts
[49:20] the caterpillar and whatever the other
[49:23] thing is I got it written down here
[49:24] Pawar and locust caterpillar can't go
[49:26] worming no wonder I can't remember
[49:28] canker can't go worm but if for eat it
[49:31] down for had to raise it back up okay
[49:33] God had to combat it with the four and
[49:36] the other what happened is is the three
[49:38] the three
[49:40] was mixed into the one to make the one
[49:43] when something different
[49:45] same three colors mixed together to make
[49:48] the fourth color all right now look see
[49:52] there he become four or actually the
[49:54] three and one it was all mixed up in
[49:57] that one thing all right there be okay
[49:59] with that say ma'am all right so we got
[50:01] four we're looking at four stages we're
[50:03] looking at four things that we're going
[50:06] to take now and look at and see if we
[50:08] can put this thing all together so now
[50:10] look going up to four stages bring it
[50:11] all the way up now look all ate away at
[50:16] the parts of the tree but they couldn't
[50:20] get to the life
[50:21] you can't kill God you can't kill God
[50:26] now tell you what they did do you know
[50:30] where they you know where they tried to
[50:31] kill him at don't you what do they kill
[50:34] him on what they kill Christ on a tree
[50:39] that had no leaf no bark no fruit and no
[50:46] wife but the very life that created the
[50:51] tree the root was hanging on that cross
[50:56] with me inside of him so I don't have to
[51:00] hang on that old tree no more God's
[51:03] already done it for us look at all the
[51:06] things he's done for us
[51:07] yeah I was thinking I just thinking
[51:08] about that a few minutes ago I looked
[51:09] down and I thought so all those all
[51:12] those things cuz one's eat the fruit one
[51:14] eat the leave ones eat the bark and one
[51:15] sucks it to life that's what he was hung
[51:19] on he was hung on a denominational tree
[51:22] that had no wife in it at all no Bart no
[51:25] leaves no fruit but the very fruit
[51:29] himself the very seed offspring root
[51:34] everything was hanging on that tree the
[51:36] very life look the very life of God was
[51:42] hanging on that tree
[51:45] that's where we will find our
[51:47] restoration I will restore all the years
[51:53] and it looks to foresee a look now I
[51:56] want to notice the four of them I notice
[51:59] off marker four of the spiritual
[52:01] mathematics God is 3 this is 4 he's in
[52:04] four here first Antichrist comes
[52:07] remember when he started off he was anti
[52:09] against the word all right so it was
[52:12] Antichrist second false prophet what
[52:17] they brought them all together and
[52:18] started teaching them a false doctrine
[52:20] from men the Spirit went in men wait
[52:24] listen there's not some spirit gonna
[52:26] come through that wall and teach us
[52:28] something they might anoint you to do
[52:31] something but they're not gonna walk
[52:33] through that door and deceive you and to
[52:35] believe in something but when that
[52:37] spirit goes inside of a man and that man
[52:40] gets you to see it
[52:42] there's your false prophet read third
[52:45] Vakar of heaven and earth and purgatory
[52:48] black remember that's when they crowned
[52:50] him fourth the beasts pale horse Satan
[52:57] being kicked out of heaven and we're
[53:00] reading in just a minute so we see in
[53:02] the fourth one that Satan gets kicked
[53:04] out of heaven now look let's go back
[53:07] just for a minute they don't have this
[53:08] on them on the screen but I want to want
[53:12] to read something right here brother
[53:13] Branham says the Palmer worm locust
[53:15] caterpillar and cankerworm
[53:17] no don't worry about that it's not gonna
[53:18] be on here I'm just gonna read it here
[53:20] because you got the devil is in the
[53:23] Palmer warn locust caterpillar and can't
[53:25] go worm right and just like what we were
[53:28] talking about the Palmer worm begins to
[53:30] eat at the fruit of the Spirit so guess
[53:34] what if he ate the fruit of the Spirit
[53:37] down and we're going to come to
[53:39] restoration then the fruit of the
[53:41] spirits got to come back in the church
[53:45] and then the locust eats the leaves
[53:51] that's fellowship all right we are with
[53:54] then we fellowship has to be restored
[53:57] fellowship is why
[53:58] brotherly kindness is part of fellowship
[54:00] well today we'll get to it a little bit
[54:02] later cankerworm eats the bar the Bart
[54:05] brother Brown said is your doctrine that
[54:08] doctrine was eat down the fruit of the
[54:10] Spirit was eating down fellowship was
[54:12] eating down listen
[54:14] the caterpillar sucks at the life the
[54:16] last days he sucks at the life but he
[54:19] can't get to the life of this tree
[54:21] hey man cuz brother Branham says the
[54:23] same God comes through justification
[54:26] sanctification the baptism the Holy
[54:28] Ghost and living the life so the four
[54:32] stages is what justification
[54:34] sanctification the baptism of Holy Ghost
[54:37] and then incarnate God incarnate God
[54:39] must be in this age what's this let's
[54:44] continue reading bring that back up
[54:46] let's read this see what brother Brent
[54:47] said the bed on it I'll let him tell you
[54:50] look at paragraph 165 let's going up
[54:53] because remember he's incarnate in the
[54:55] Beast whoa whoa right there
[54:59] 165 now you see he was cast out of the
[55:01] earth and becomes incarnate I mean he
[55:05] really meant cast out of heaven you know
[55:06] that don't you
[55:07] he was cast out of heaven all right and
[55:09] became incarnate but now also that could
[55:13] not be that could be talking to me and
[55:16] you because he's gonna have to come out
[55:18] of this earth and then as the Antichrist
[55:21] spirit became incarnate into a man the
[55:23] man changes from one thing to another
[55:25] from an antichrist spirit which was what
[55:28] people saying things in the early church
[55:32] age to a false prophet then they had to
[55:34] answer to one guy then the Beast comes
[55:37] in to him just exactly like the church
[55:40] grows his church went from Antichrist
[55:43] the false prophet and then the great age
[55:45] to come the beast that is to rise up so
[55:48] the church comes the same way through
[55:51] justification sanctification the baptism
[55:54] of the Holy Ghost as Christ being in the
[55:57] people just exactly and he's got the
[55:59] anti top of it over there--they this see
[56:03] the top of it rather there he is just
[56:05] exactly that's him kicked out of heaven
[56:08] hey by all right with that saying man so
[56:11] as as
[56:12] Satan has eat this tree down God has
[56:15] already got in place to bring you back
[56:17] and then what you and I have to see in
[56:20] this fourth church age is that he's got
[56:23] to be kicked out of us because the
[56:27] without that the rapture can't take
[56:29] place the dead Saints can't come back
[56:32] into this dimension and I'm like I'm
[56:34] like you know brother daylight
[56:36] everybody say rapture rapture rapture I
[56:38] see in the rapture that's okay
[56:42] you got to have a nother standing that
[56:48] the dead in Christ has to rise first so
[56:50] there has to be a resurrection message
[56:53] preached to get those dead Saints out of
[56:56] the ground then the rapture will take
[56:58] place amen there's got to be what this
[57:01] whole tree has got to be restored by
[57:03] fruit of the spirit leaves fellowship
[57:05] the doctrines got to be right we can't
[57:08] get them people out of the ground with
[57:09] the false doctrine hey man you ain't
[57:15] gonna get them dead people out of the
[57:16] ground listening to one man hello oh
[57:24] I'll bet my life on it
[57:27] so that's what the Bible says it takes a
[57:31] fivefold ministry to perfect the same
[57:33] amen
[57:36] so I depend on you then and you got to
[57:41] depend on me
[57:42] I don't depend on one man I don't end on
[57:46] one woman I depend on what Croxton a
[57:50] bride that we all walk up we all go up
[57:53] that statue of a perfect man and listen
[57:55] honestly some of us need to be pulled
[57:57] and drugged but the ones that don't need
[58:03] to be pulled and drugged needs to reach
[58:04] and get the ones that are pull they need
[58:06] to be pulled in drug and get them up
[58:08] here we're we all coming again listen
[58:12] we're not gonna leave this place till
[58:14] everybody comes to perfection we're not
[58:18] going
[58:19] so we got to preach a perfect message
[58:22] we're not perfect people by no means but
[58:25] we must preach a perfect message in this
[58:29] fourth seal all this has got to take
[58:31] place death has to be destroyed while
[58:35] we're standing on this earth
[58:38] it's not gonna come with a profit coming
[58:41] back it's not gonna be from one man it's
[58:45] gonna be brother Branham sitting
[58:47] rapturing faith lies in these books and
[58:50] tapes
[58:51] he's already preached it we just gotta
[58:53] find it we gotta find it and we got to
[58:56] preach it and preach it hard amen watch
[59:04] what Jesus said and there was war in
[59:11] heaven now brother Browne said go back
[59:15] go back one more time go back down
[59:17] throughout the world now this is the
[59:20] fourth seal this is a quote from the
[59:22] message the fourth seal he talks about
[59:25] Satan kicked out of heaven so there must
[59:27] be something we know for a fact that
[59:30] when we go up the Prophet said Satan
[59:32] comes down he's up there right now
[59:34] accusing us of everything in the world
[59:37] he's not accusing the Baptist he's not a
[59:41] kid's in the Methodist and I'm just
[59:42] using that as a lot or people in the
[59:44] message got false doctrine he's worried
[59:48] about me and you he's not worried about
[59:50] somebody one word off he's not worried
[59:54] about right you don't care about that he
[59:59] cares about the truth he attacked the
[1:00:02] true tree he attracts Christ
[1:00:07] z3d life the tree of life he attacked
[1:00:11] him so why not is he not going to thank
[1:00:13] you but God has already raised up a
[1:00:16] standard he's already give us a message
[1:00:19] to combat all this because in this
[1:00:22] fourth days we get out of here or in
[1:00:25] this fourth seal I'm sorry in the
[1:00:28] seventh Church age doesn't listen the
[1:00:29] Sabbath church age is going to keep
[1:00:31] going on
[1:00:32] we're gonna be caught up out of this age
[1:00:35] and the age is just going to keep going
[1:00:36] on amen but there's a secret catching
[1:00:40] away and that secret is I was telling
[1:00:43] him downstairs even the Apostle Paul he
[1:00:48] didn't work with a totally open book
[1:00:54] he didn't a lot of things he didn't
[1:00:58] understand but what's the paradox what
[1:01:03] we get to understand has got to come
[1:01:05] from what he wrote so he was writing in
[1:01:08] prophecy he was prophesying of a people
[1:01:12] to come battle take this and understand
[1:01:15] it and know what it means
[1:01:18] Paul says I look to a glass darkly
[1:01:20] listen we can't get the dead Saints here
[1:01:22] looking through a glass darkly because
[1:01:26] what what Paul say then though then we
[1:01:29] meet him face to face
[1:01:30] now when we meet Christ face to face on
[1:01:33] this side you know we don't meet him
[1:01:35] physically but remember he's because
[1:01:39] he's gonna be here so much forget what I
[1:01:42] just said forget what I just said he's
[1:01:46] here now he's here now
[1:01:49] he's not coming he's here now we just
[1:01:53] gotta believe he's here now because you
[1:01:56] know what we're looking for him why
[1:02:00] don't we just start looking at him that
[1:02:05] all right
[1:02:07] sometimes you know you get checked a
[1:02:10] little bit you know that he's not he's
[1:02:12] not and we got to quit saying that well
[1:02:14] well when he comes well Juanita he's
[1:02:18] here amen so we've got to come to a part
[1:02:24] this is our box you already believe it
[1:02:28] or not but I'm by finished for right now
[1:02:30] I don't want to go any further I'll get
[1:02:32] something else in next Sunday but we
[1:02:34] come to this box but in this box when
[1:02:36] this box ends and you come into the
[1:02:39] fifth seal we're going
[1:02:44] so everything's got to happen right here
[1:02:47] for us today it's the day of salvation
[1:02:50] today is the day of our restoration and
[1:02:53] I believe he is restoring look at the
[1:02:55] things we've all come through all of us
[1:02:57] even our understanding of when we
[1:02:59] weren't in church and now we're in
[1:03:01] church or will we had another church and
[1:03:02] we I don't mean come here I mean come
[1:03:04] under a revelation that what God has
[1:03:07] already give us but I watched what
[1:03:10] Christ told us he said in John 12:31
[1:03:12] they don't have it here John 12:31
[1:03:15] Christ said now is the judgment of this
[1:03:19] world now shall the Prince of this world
[1:03:23] be cast out John 12:32 and I if I be
[1:03:30] lifted up from the earth will draw all
[1:03:33] men unto me John 14:30 hereafter I will
[1:03:38] not talk much with you for the prince of
[1:03:41] this world cometh and has nothing in me
[1:03:45] now let's pull back up pull that back up
[1:03:49] let me read the last scripture then and
[1:03:50] that was war in heaven and Michael and
[1:03:53] his angels fought against the Dragon and
[1:03:54] who's Michael Christ Christ in who the
[1:03:57] hope of glory
[1:03:59] you see that's the problem we got
[1:04:04] Michael fighting Satan over there in
[1:04:06] heaven somewhere Michael and his angels
[1:04:14] fought against the Dragon and the dragon
[1:04:16] fought and his angels I like this and
[1:04:19] prevailed not neither was their place
[1:04:22] found any more in heaven and the Great
[1:04:27] Dragon was cast out the old serpent
[1:04:29] called the devil and Satan which
[1:04:32] deceiveth the whole world he was cast
[1:04:36] out into the into the earth and his
[1:04:39] angels were cast out with him and I
[1:04:41] heard a loud voice saying in heaven it
[1:04:44] wasn't just a whisper it was a thunder
[1:04:48] it was a voice that said now is come
[1:04:54] salvation and strength
[1:04:56] and the kingdom of our God and the power
[1:04:58] of his Christ for the accuser of our
[1:05:01] brethren is cast down which accused them
[1:05:04] before our God day and night and they
[1:05:09] overcame him by the blood of the Lamb
[1:05:12] and by the word of their testimony and
[1:05:14] they loved not their lives unto death
[1:05:18] therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that
[1:05:22] dwell in them woe to the inhabitants of
[1:05:24] the earth and of the sea for the devil
[1:05:27] has come down unto you having great
[1:05:29] wrath because he knoweth he hath but a
[1:05:32] short time under the fourth seal Satan
[1:05:36] is cast out first he's got to be cast
[1:05:39] out of us then he's cast out of heaven
[1:05:42] then what does he do he comes down and
[1:05:44] incarnate sapote I'm a person he comes
[1:05:48] down and Carnot's a person as he does
[1:05:50] that we're going up because so God then
[1:05:53] must have to incarnate his bride first
[1:06:01] because remember to all these seals the
[1:06:04] state never do anything original no way
[1:06:07] he is not he no he don't even have a
[1:06:10] seat to reproduce yourself with Amen so
[1:06:14] that means every word he's got his
[1:06:16] faults and brings nothing but death but
[1:06:18] now here you and I have come and we must
[1:06:20] have to say this right here the same
[1:06:21] thing here for I will not talk much with
[1:06:24] you for the prince of this world cometh
[1:06:25] and has nothing now he's going to
[1:06:29] Calvary looks like it looked like Satan
[1:06:33] won but the prince of this world cometh
[1:06:37] and hath nothing in me jesus said in
[1:06:41] revelation 22:16
[1:06:42] I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify
[1:06:44] unto you these things in the churches I
[1:06:47] am the root an offspring of David and
[1:06:51] the bright and morning star
[1:06:54] hey man you love the Lord they overcome
[1:06:57] by the blood of the Lamb and by the word
[1:06:59] of their testimony and they loved not
[1:07:01] their lives unto death so we see in the
[1:07:04] fourth seal we got what we've got fruit
[1:07:08] leaves bark
[1:07:10] wife that's what's got to be restored so
[1:07:14] you know what's what's restoring that
[1:07:17] all this fellowship is being restored
[1:07:19] what did I tell you before the seals are
[1:07:23] not for remember the seals are not
[1:07:26] exactly for your new berth to get you
[1:07:29] born again
[1:07:29] no no Crocs died on the cross he said
[1:07:33] believe if you believe me I'll come and
[1:07:36] be with you even in you amen
[1:07:38] didn't say nothing about a seal but to
[1:07:41] bring back full fellowship to bring back
[1:07:44] what the restoration of what Adam had
[1:07:49] amen
[1:07:50] because before Adam fell he had full
[1:07:54] authority and he could talk to God every
[1:07:59] day anytime he wanted to
[1:08:01] he could walk right up to him and talk
[1:08:03] to him and there was no fear there was
[1:08:05] no death there was no sorrow there was
[1:08:07] nothing that could take him away from
[1:08:09] God well now if we're going to be
[1:08:11] restored back to that then we got to
[1:08:13] come back to that same condition you and
[1:08:15] I have come back to the place now where
[1:08:17] here we are what we going to do about it
[1:08:21] what we're going to do about it
[1:08:25] that's our box and one day you know
[1:08:28] what's going to happen that box is going
[1:08:32] to disappear and you know what if you're
[1:08:36] in the box you go with it if you're not
[1:08:38] in the box you don't go with it you got
[1:08:41] to stay here and walk continue in that
[1:08:42] church age and take all the wrath that
[1:08:45] comes with that Church age because you
[1:08:47] didn't accept it so these seals now we
[1:08:50] come up and when they're not for like I
[1:08:52] said they're not for so much is for to
[1:08:57] get you born again it's more to get us
[1:08:59] more in fellowship with God because what
[1:09:01] we lost was what brother Branham goes to
[1:09:03] it read reference to the bride tree
[1:09:05] fruit of the Spirit the leaves was what
[1:09:08] every time every time a breeze comes by
[1:09:13] watch the leaves one worshiping God well
[1:09:17] the old locust he started eating out of
[1:09:20] ways all they did was you know set like
[1:09:24] most of y'all did in a search service
[1:09:27] most of y'all most of y'all in the
[1:09:30] church service you know if you moved
[1:09:35] if you move you probably hurt and then
[1:09:43] the bark you know what the problem with
[1:09:46] the bark is he's give us to Lord seven
[1:09:49] thunders return ministry and all this
[1:09:51] other junk that people are preaching he
[1:09:54] took the doctrine of the church right
[1:09:55] out and put in false teaching but I will
[1:09:59] restore he promised and he's gonna do it
[1:10:04] because you know what that's what he
[1:10:04] gave us and this is what you know what
[1:10:07] we can't be born again under Luther's
[1:10:10] box God moved on God moved on we can't
[1:10:16] be can't go back there sure we live
[1:10:18] under the joy and the and the things of
[1:10:20] these other ages but that's our age our
[1:10:22] age is what destroy the devil
[1:10:27] now listen he's not annihilated but he's
[1:10:30] got to be destroyed in me and you the
[1:10:31] Prince of this world they stand the
[1:10:33] prince of this world has come he's gonna
[1:10:36] come but he has nothing in me you know
[1:10:42] what nothing you know what Jesus was
[1:10:44] saying there's no false idea there's no
[1:10:47] false doctrine there's no false I was
[1:10:50] reading where brother mom said that
[1:10:51] Jesus Christ was the pure truth
[1:10:57] everything he was was the pure truth he
[1:11:01] didn't just have the word he was the
[1:11:04] living work and in if you and I get here
[1:11:08] we go again become joint heirs then we
[1:11:11] don't just have the word we're the
[1:11:14] living work amen musicians come we are
[1:11:18] the Living Word of God made manifest
[1:11:20] that's our that what that's our
[1:11:23] inheritance our inheritance is not just
[1:11:28] I will die hallelujah by and by no I'll
[1:11:33] not die I'll be raptured by him ah
[1:11:36] I'll fly away let's look brother Joe
[1:11:39] doing a good job give credit where
[1:11:42] credit's due

[1:11:47] me a lot of his daddy don't you yeah his
[1:11:53] daddy was our song leader for a long
[1:11:54] time back in the 70s when Joe wasn't

[1:12:19] and that coming here and there the
[1:12:21] prince of this world cometh now Jesus

[1:12:27] there brother Bram said
[1:12:28] stinging him that old stinger of death
[1:12:31] he was sitting there but what did Christ
[1:12:33] say he has nothing nothing in me

[1:15:57] the way
[1:16:00] god bless
[1:16:04] we bless your name
[1:16:07] you know why folks we gonna have to
[1:16:09] start what we're doing is our problem is
[1:16:11] is we're not really listening to what
[1:16:14] the Bible's already give us we can sit
[1:16:18] and listen to preaching that's what we
[1:16:20] do and I believe we're as a church we're
[1:16:22] growing not just by numbers but we're
[1:16:24] growing in spirit I'd rather see growing
[1:16:27] spirit than growing numbers but growing
[1:16:30] in spirit you're gonna have problems but
[1:16:32] you know what I believe we've got
[1:16:33] something in place to handle although
[1:16:36] the Prince of this world will come
[1:16:39] [Music]
[1:16:45] remember what brother Brown said one
[1:16:47] time he said I want to be so hidden God
[1:16:50] till Satan doesn't know what to do with
[1:16:52] me yeah I mean really can you believe
[1:16:56] that you get to a place to where but you
[1:17:01] know what it's gonna have to be because
[1:17:04] Satan is death
[1:17:05] Satan is fear Satan is death those two
[1:17:09] things have to be destroyed here by the
[1:17:12] Word of God in a group of people doing
[1:17:17] the simple things like brother said you
[1:17:20] know go to church read your Bible the
[1:17:23] simple things we do but that standard
[1:17:27] has already been put there because we
[1:17:30] had a prophet coming the end time and he
[1:17:32] said hey this is what we got to do
[1:17:35] you're an astronaut now you've been
[1:17:39] pressurized for the job not in training
[1:17:43] I believe our trainings about over I
[1:17:46] believe we've come to place where the
[1:17:48] astronaut will we can walk in there we
[1:17:50] match the button fire that big engine up
[1:17:53] and take off the mass all ready been
[1:17:56] done and then the mysteries have all
[1:17:59] become history what are we doing now
[1:18:02] we're just what honing we're getting
[1:18:05] we're getting we're getting our
[1:18:06] believing into a channel and I believe
[1:18:10] if we'll hit that sure we hit it every
[1:18:11] once in a while we see miracles we see
[1:18:13] things happen but man I'm telling you
[1:18:16] brother Brown said watch when all that
[1:18:20] lightning and all that fire and all that
[1:18:22] stuff comes together gotta land on a
[1:18:25] church then well you know what he's
[1:18:26] going to do he's not going on something
[1:18:29] dead he's gonna anoint what's already
[1:18:33] there
[1:18:34] hey man because this is what's there for
[1:18:37] us our prophet told us they will be a
[1:18:40] resurrection in this endtime rapturing
[1:18:44] faith lies in the books in the tape I
[1:18:46] just believe that I'm just dumb enough
[1:18:47] to believe what he said I don't want to
[1:18:49] believe what nobody else said I won't
[1:18:50] believe what he said hey man let's sing
[1:18:52] one more song before we go
[1:18:55] [Music]
[1:18:57] [Applause]
[1:18:58] [Music]
[1:19:00] let me turn see
[1:19:04] Oh

[1:19:09] that one punch
[1:19:12] [Music]

[1:19:33] time

[1:20:17] I mean you gettin real touch I mean take
[1:20:20] this with you you know we're in the
[1:20:22] final we're in the final stretch listen
[1:20:26] when you run a relay race how many
[1:20:29] people are in the relay race for the
[1:20:34] last guy needs to be what the fastest
[1:20:37] called the fear behind you won't Dan
[1:20:40] dude to catch up so I think we've handed
[1:20:44] the baton to the fourth person brother
[1:20:48] Brown passed off the scene and he handed
[1:20:51] that but time to a fast group of people
[1:20:54] this fast coming to the head to where
[1:20:57] what the work Christ can live and I died
[1:21:02] we need that more than anything right
[1:21:05] sure we got life to live sure we got
[1:21:07] jobs we got stuff to do and you know
[1:21:10] what stuff gets in the way but you know
[1:21:12] what he's got some people that has a
[1:21:14] little time
[1:21:15] how about praying for us to don't have a
[1:21:16] long time and then next Sunday before we
[1:21:20] go next Sunday we're going to have a
[1:21:21] special visitor and he has found us
[1:21:26] online a couple of years ago from I went
[1:21:28] to Minnesota and preached for me in
[1:21:29] January if you'll remember that he's
[1:21:32] named for us dunker and he's going to be
[1:21:34] here with us
[1:21:35] he watches in every Sunday but he's
[1:21:37] gonna be here with us next Saturday and
[1:21:39] Sunday he's gonna be in church service
[1:21:40] with us so I know you're treating him
[1:21:43] well because you always treat her better
[1:21:44] as well but he's really not a visitor
[1:21:46] he's just behind the camera you can't
[1:21:48] see him but he's considers herself part
[1:21:51] of our congregation he doesn't have
[1:21:53] anybody real close to to fellowship with
[1:21:55] so and man you talk about somebody's got
[1:21:59] a testimony he's got testimony but he's
[1:22:02] a real super nice guy but I'll just pray
[1:22:04] for him pray for his journey and then
[1:22:06] we'll see y'all Wednesday night Lord
[1:22:08] willing pray for the ones that are there
[1:22:10] out and and and brother Anderson in Las
[1:22:14] Vegas
[1:22:15] merci he needs prayer but you know what
[1:22:20] Jesus Walt Jesus walked with prostitutes
[1:22:23] and sinners and they didn't bother him
[1:22:25] one bit hey man
[1:22:27] then balling one bit why because the
[1:22:30] prince of this world come and didn't
[1:22:32] have nothing in him and you know what
[1:22:33] you say that you say that
[1:22:35] you say that when Satan come to you or

[1:22:51] gonna live a lot longer than you are I'm

[1:23:12] in time if you're born again today you
[1:23:15] absolutely are an eternal creature
[1:23:16] trapped in time but one day that's gonna
[1:23:19] come together and we're gonna get out of
[1:23:21] here you love the Lord
[1:23:22] listen bow our heads your heavenly
[1:23:25] Father we pray Lord that what we've said
[1:23:27] has been pleasing to you Lord and maybe
[1:23:29] it helped the people Lord realize that
[1:23:33] we come to this opening of this fourth
[1:23:35] seal and so important to us because we
[1:23:38] leave this dimension we actually have
[1:23:43] this vile body that we're walking in
[1:23:46] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:23:49] an eye but before that Lord one day and
[1:23:57] I want to see that day it will be
[1:24:01] preaching you're wording
[1:24:04] Robert Tatum walks to the court sister
[1:24:08] kollene walks through the door and all
[1:24:12] the ones just went on brother Gary
[1:24:14] brother Richard Donny's mom and dad all
[1:24:20] the ones that we're thinking about now
[1:24:22] Lord we're sad but Lord Jesus they're
[1:24:27] more real than we are they are more real
[1:24:31] they're gonna bring something into this
[1:24:32] dimension that's only been done by one
[1:24:33] man and that's you they're gonna bring
[1:24:36] an eternal body into this hellhole
[1:24:39] called Earth but Lord you told us that
[1:24:44] it wouldn't be very long though we which
[1:24:46] are alive and remain shall not prevent
[1:24:49] or hinder those which are asleep for the
[1:24:53] trumpet will sound the dead in Christ
[1:24:55] shall rise first and will be changed
[1:24:59] right here in Satan's Eden right here
[1:25:04] under its nose will be changed and will
[1:25:09] be called away and then let the wrath
[1:25:12] come on the unbelievers father we pray
[1:25:17] Lord as we made that statement we now
[1:25:20] think of family friends children loved
[1:25:26] ones that are not saved Lord you're
[1:25:29] still us in killing God you're still a
[1:25:32] soul saving God you're still a God that
[1:25:36] could take somebody don't even want you
[1:25:40] and change their whole being into a
[1:25:45] child of God prostitute
[1:25:50] doesn't matter those are just names it's
[1:25:54] just all unbelief and Lord through these
[1:25:59] seals we see that that unbelief is being
[1:26:01] cast out and has went in another
[1:26:08] direction repent means to turn and go in
[1:26:13] another direction Lord we thank you for
[1:26:17] these people here father that's been
[1:26:20] with us for a long time and truly the
[1:26:23] ones that's went on Lord we miss them

[1:26:28] time they're having rejoicing knowing
[1:26:32] that they're coming back here to see us
[1:26:35] face to face and then Lord we'll get to
[1:26:38] see you when we go to that marriage
[1:26:40] supper then we'll come back and spend a
[1:26:43] thousand years on this earth just
[1:26:45] fellowship in with one another and
[1:26:48] that's not even the eternal part Lord
[1:26:50] you've got a future home it's going to
[1:26:53] come down and we're gonna live in that
[1:26:54] city for an eternity nothing to hinder
[1:26:57] no sorrow no pain Lord this you just put
[1:27:01] a short season the Bible says this is
[1:27:03] just a vapor life is but Lord while
[1:27:07] we're living in this life give us all
