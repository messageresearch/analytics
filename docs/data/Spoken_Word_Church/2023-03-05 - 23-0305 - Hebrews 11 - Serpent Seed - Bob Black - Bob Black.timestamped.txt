[0:00] God bless you thanks good to be in the
[0:02] house of the Lord
[0:08] let's just jump right in and we'll look
[0:10] at a couple of slides and then we'll
[0:12] we'll read our scripture
[0:13] what we've been talking about is is in
[0:16] uh Hebrews 11 of what what faith is and
[0:21] how that's the only way that you can
[0:23] please God and how Abel had a revelation
[0:26] and we just and and all the others
[0:29] Enoch and and all the other ones that
[0:31] are mentioned in the Hall of faith in
[0:33] Hebrews 11. her brother Brown said in
[0:35] the power of God he said Abel by
[0:37] Revelation he saw that it wasn't fruits
[0:39] that brought us out of the Garden of
[0:40] Eden that some people still think it was
[0:41] but it wasn't fruits
[0:43] it wasn't fruit like cane talk it was
[0:47] the blood of his mother who had made him
[0:49] mortal or his father now look how he's
[0:51] he's kind of uh uh yeah exactly he's
[0:55] correcting it was the blood of his
[0:57] father who made immoral so he came and
[1:00] offered the blood of a lamb by divine
[1:02] revelation
[1:03] no one to tell him anything about it but
[1:05] he by faith he seen the Son of God
[1:07] coming and offered a lamb and a
[1:09] figurative type and seeing that Jesus
[1:10] was the lamb slain before the foundation
[1:12] of the world
[1:13] and God testified that's the truth God
[1:16] will always Testify the truth
[1:19] now um this is Sunday school class you
[1:22] know it gives us an opportunity to kind
[1:23] of kind of move back a little bit and
[1:25] just kind of cover some things
[1:27] um you know like serpent seed the
[1:29] serpency doctor what what was Abel as a
[1:32] revelation why did he bring a lamb and
[1:34] so as we dive into this um I I think
[1:37] Sunday school kind of gives us an
[1:38] opportunity to kind of kind of dive into
[1:40] this a little bit more and some of these
[1:42] slides um a few of them you know this is
[1:45] a sensitive topic you want to deal with
[1:47] it with discretion and so forth but some
[1:49] of these are a little bit heavy-handed
[1:51] so I will give you a warning before I
[1:52] move to the next one this is about as
[1:54] heavy-handed as I'll get
[1:57] see brother Brown said in Fellowship he
[1:59] says there's an elephant of Life In The
[2:01] Blood life is in the blood cell
[2:04] life comes from the male sex and that's
[2:06] where brother Brown on that last quote
[2:08] that he corrected what are you saying
[2:09] from the mail life comes from the male
[2:12] not from the woman the woman can produce
[2:15] life because she's the egg but she
[2:16] produces the egg but the male produces
[2:19] the germ The Germ of Life comes from the
[2:22] male because it's in the blood cell
[2:25] and in that blood cell lays life so now
[2:28] that's what we're talking about this
[2:30] morning life
[2:31] you want to get life you've got to you
[2:33] gotta be with the male and in the blood
[2:35] cell and the state in the place of Jesus
[2:37] was not the sexual Affair of a man but
[2:41] the creative power of God so now he's
[2:43] talking about why you ever think um and
[2:46] maybe
[2:47] just say that the the reason there's a
[2:51] reason why Jesus had to come from a
[2:53] virgin birth
[2:54] it had to be born from aversion of birth
[2:56] to be the antidote before they fall what
[2:58] happened in the Garden of Eden
[3:01] was not that was not by the sexual
[3:03] Affair of a man but the creative power
[3:04] of God it created a blood cell in the
[3:07] womb of Mary with that egg that brought
[3:09] forth the Son of God which was the
[3:11] tabernacle that God lived in himself
[3:14] and so that's that's the stage for what
[3:15] we're studying on in verse 4. so let's
[3:18] just pray before we get into our little
[3:19] study and ask the Lord to bless it this
[3:22] morning Lord God we're so grateful to be
[3:24] able to gather together around your word
[3:25] this morning and we just ask your
[3:26] blessings Lord as we study these things
[3:28] out you are quickening to us Lord it
[3:30] won't just be it won't just be like the
[3:32] just the word that's not been quickened
[3:35] but we need we need you to come and
[3:37] Quicken the word to us to make it alive
[3:39] because without you it won't be a life
[3:42] but Lord if you come and give life to it
[3:45] then it'll spring forth into a living
[3:47] reality to us Lord that will live in US
[3:50] Lord we ask Lord that you'll just
[3:52] Quicken the word to us today Lord be
[3:54] with brother Wade as he's prepared and
[3:55] studying Lord and that you'll set our
[3:57] mind in order Lord so that we can be
[3:59] prepared to receive Lord Jesus and
[4:01] granted Lord we ask it in your name amen
[4:05] so in verse 4 it says by faith Abel
[4:08] offered unto God a more excellent
[4:10] sacrifice than Cain and you see how
[4:12] faith faith faith is the only way you
[4:14] can please God and by faith faith Abel
[4:16] had a revelation that went beyond just
[4:19] the teaching the education and the
[4:21] theology that maybe his mother and
[4:22] father had given him and and of course
[4:25] they both came with a desire to to
[4:27] present their sacrifice the way that
[4:29] they thought the approach should be but
[4:31] Abel had a revelation
[4:33] and that's how he obtained he had
[4:35] obtained witness that he was righteous
[4:38] God testifying of his gifts and by being
[4:41] dead yet speaketh by by he being dead
[4:45] yet yes speaketh so God came on the
[4:49] scene and proved that Abel's Revelation
[4:51] was correct by accepting his sacrifice
[4:53] now if we look into some of these quotes
[4:55] brother Brown said in the questions and
[4:57] answers law having a shadow he said just
[4:59] to just to paint that picture of what
[5:01] happened he said there stood Adam and
[5:03] Eve Eve a beautiful woman
[5:05] I can see their Adam with them dark
[5:08] Shaggy locks hanging around his head
[5:10] those bright flashy eyes look over to
[5:13] his little sweetheart Eve and such a
[5:16] perfect built woman and her hair looked
[5:18] up and her eyes as blue as the sky Adam
[5:21] loved her oh how he loved her but when
[5:24] sin entered in their little home was
[5:26] broke up because of an old lustful Beast
[5:28] the devil had got into an animal called
[5:31] The Serpent not a reptile remember the
[5:33] Bible doesn't say that the devil was a
[5:35] snake he wasn't a snake in the beginning
[5:38] the snake wasn't like he is now in the
[5:41] beginning the curse put him where he's
[5:42] at the Bible said he was not a reptile
[5:45] he was a beast and the most subtle of
[5:47] all the beasts of the field he looked
[5:49] more like a man than anything you've
[5:51] ever had walked upright there's where
[5:54] the devil got in him and come to Eve
[5:56] this beautiful made woman and she did
[5:59] what was wrong
[6:00] now you look at what subtle means that
[6:03] that's kind of a weird we don't have
[6:05] when we read a book today we don't have
[6:07] any any you know it's very seldom where
[6:10] you'd see a word spelled like that
[6:12] s-u-b-t-i-l-sub-till brother Ram said
[6:15] and what that means is he said the
[6:16] serpent is that missing person between
[6:18] the chimpanzee and the man and he said
[6:21] he went and got dictionaries today from
[6:22] everywhere to look up this word what the
[6:24] word settlement it means to be smart to
[6:26] be crafty
[6:28] and so you look online and see what what
[6:30] that word subtil means it means it's
[6:32] it's really just an archaic spelling of
[6:34] subtle
[6:35] and it's no longer used in any variety
[6:37] of English though it's a modern word in
[6:39] French and German but what it means is
[6:40] being to be real clever cleverly using
[6:43] indirect methods to achieve something
[6:45] somebody that's sneaky now you think
[6:47] about the Beast and the garden being
[6:49] being sneaky enough to just kind of
[6:51] twist the words a little bit and you see
[6:53] you bring it over in the present day
[6:54] that's what the devil will do today is
[6:56] just twist it just enough to where you
[6:58] think well the promise isn't for me
[7:01] I can't get my healing Twisted enough to
[7:04] where you don't understand how to be
[7:05] born again well as long as you as long
[7:07] as you just feel something you got it
[7:09] just twist it enough and then that keeps
[7:11] the promise from being fulfilled just
[7:13] just change it just enough so there uh
[7:15] now so
[7:17] brother around me he's explaining what
[7:19] what that Beast the serpent is the
[7:21] missing person between the chimpanzee
[7:23] and the man so let's let's just look at
[7:25] that for a second now what that means is
[7:27] you know Darwin started when he he wrote
[7:30] that his book the origin of the species
[7:32] after he went to the galapagosa islands
[7:34] he went out there and he saw
[7:37] um you can see on the cover of the book
[7:38] is all of these these finches that he
[7:40] saw on on the on the Galapagos Islands
[7:43] and you can see each of these finches
[7:47] um Darwin Darwin believed that they came
[7:48] from a finch and uh they were com had a
[7:51] common ancestor in South America that
[7:53] they all came from this descended from
[7:55] this one Finch but they they they slowly
[7:57] began to develop these different
[7:58] characteristics one Finch on one Island
[8:01] had to had to uh get little bugs and
[8:05] stuff so it would it learned how to use
[8:07] a little a little stick to get bugs and
[8:08] another would eat a certain kind of
[8:10] fruit where it needed a long beak so
[8:12] they started they started developing
[8:13] these little small characteristics you
[8:15] can see the pictures where some of them
[8:16] have big beaks and some have small beaks
[8:19] some have long beaks some have short
[8:20] beaks so they all have developed these
[8:23] little characteristics so Darwin got in
[8:25] his idea he could see where you know
[8:27] things began it looked like things were
[8:29] evolving from a common ancestor coming
[8:31] from a common ancestor so he began to
[8:33] think you know I can I can see something
[8:35] happening but there's got to be so
[8:38] surely that happened with with uh we
[8:41] where we came from so he's looking for
[8:43] this transition what you can look at
[8:45] monkeys and see see see things moving
[8:47] along surely there had to be where where
[8:48] is the link between a gorilla or
[8:51] whatever it would be a chimpanzee or
[8:53] something and human there's got to be a
[8:55] transition so that's the The Missing
[8:57] Link what's that transition the Darwin
[9:00] Darwin was looking for a transition
[9:01] scientists have been looking for that
[9:03] transition because it you know you if if
[9:05] if that kind of evolution were true and
[9:08] I want to pause just for a second now we
[9:10] believe we do believe that God went
[9:12] through a stage of Creative Evolution
[9:14] where he started from something simple
[9:16] and began to work up and something until
[9:19] he finally he achieved his Grand purpose
[9:21] to manifest himself and Adam and Eve in
[9:23] Harmony in the garden so we do believe
[9:26] in evolution in that sense where God is
[9:28] behind it God is the one that's
[9:30] orchestrating it but not just some
[9:32] haphazard thing where like you look on
[9:34] the wall and you can see a clock there
[9:36] or you look in your in your on the desk
[9:37] and you see a book there and you just
[9:39] think well you think nobody made that
[9:42] book nobody made that clock now you look
[9:44] at a clock on the wall and you know that
[9:46] somebody made the gears you know that
[9:48] there had to be a grand designer behind
[9:50] it somebody to be able to have to have
[9:52] the knowledge to be able to put that
[9:53] together and make the make the all the
[9:55] things that go into it but see God is
[9:58] the one that's been behind it all the
[10:00] time so so see see brother Branham by
[10:03] Revelation is is revealing to us who
[10:06] what where where the where the
[10:08] transition was between between like a
[10:10] monkey or whatever whatever the lower
[10:11] form was to to get up to where the to
[10:14] the man and so and the serpent seat he
[10:16] said you can cross animals they keep
[10:19] getting higher blood higher blood higher
[10:21] form of life higher form till it climbs
[10:23] up into the man realm but the last
[10:25] connection here between it here was cut
[10:27] off how many knows that science can't
[10:29] find the missing link oh you know that
[10:31] well here he is here he is the serpent
[10:34] the missing link that transition now he
[10:37] said it now let's watch this just a
[10:38] minute he's smart smart and crafty smart
[10:42] and sneaky smart crafty enough to be
[10:45] able to have a conversation with
[10:46] somebody and twist things around to get
[10:48] to accomplish a goal accomplish a person
[10:50] that's the kind of person that this
[10:52] Beast was yet he's called The Serpent
[10:54] but remember he was the smartest thing
[10:57] there was and the more like the human
[10:59] being than anything else there was on
[11:01] the field
[11:02] closest to a human being he was not a
[11:04] reptile the curse made him a reptile
[11:07] the Bible said he was the most beautiful
[11:09] of all and even the curse didn't take
[11:11] all of his Beauty away yet the Glorious
[11:13] colors of the snake is beautiful and his
[11:16] grace and his shrewdness even the curse
[11:18] didn't move it off but you remember God
[11:21] told him that his legs would come off
[11:23] and he'd go on his belly and you can't
[11:25] find one bone and a snake that looks
[11:27] like a human being and that's the reason
[11:28] science is lost but there he is so God
[11:32] took that transition and hid it so that
[11:35] science can't find it but you can see
[11:36] where it is by Revelation and even even
[11:39] you know you just look you just look
[11:41] everywhere in the world and the snake is
[11:43] a symbol of that that deception that
[11:45] happened in the garden it's a symbol
[11:48] of well I'm trying to be speak with
[11:52] discretion but y'all know what I'm
[11:53] talking about y'all it's a symbol it's a
[11:57] it represents what what happened this in
[12:00] the spoken word is the Original Seed he
[12:02] said now look Eve what did she do she
[12:04] received the wrong seed how did she do
[12:07] it now now here's something to meditate
[12:09] on
[12:10] how does she do it believing Satan's lie
[12:14] now as we as we Trace these things out
[12:16] we'll find out that brother Brown was
[12:17] talking about two things at the same
[12:19] time
[12:20] because you got two wombs or a woman has
[12:23] two wombs a woman's got two wombs a womb
[12:25] in her mind where she first got to think
[12:27] about it think about it and receive it
[12:30] and then then the woman are barely so
[12:33] first she received it at the wrong seat
[12:35] in her mind she started believing it
[12:37] wrong she believed that she accepted
[12:39] Satan's lie how many says that's right
[12:41] and the congregation said amen why sure
[12:43] is right sure she received Satan's lie
[12:46] what she bring forth by doing it Satan
[12:49] said you know this is glorious this is a
[12:53] wonderful thing do you know you were
[12:55] made for that why you were actually made
[12:57] for this purpose oh was I
[13:00] oh it's Pleasant to the eye it's good
[13:02] you should you should try it but the
[13:05] Lord God said
[13:06] not that not yet
[13:09] wait a minute see where last time we
[13:12] were talking about how that God wants
[13:13] you just wait and that's our problem so
[13:16] many times we just want to hurry and
[13:17] force it to happen that's the
[13:19] Pentecostal problem is to force it and
[13:21] manufacture before you got Deliverance
[13:24] to try to force it and act like it just
[13:26] hold it just wait just wait on it wait a
[13:30] minute but you know oh if we do we'll oh
[13:32] you surely won't die that slick tongue
[13:35] devil he ain't got Hooves and fortel no
[13:39] no they like to try to make you believe
[13:41] he's a Slicker behind the pulpit
[13:44] or some little Ricky with his hair
[13:46] combed down like a duck
[13:49] sitting on his back out there to harm
[13:51] some mother's daughter that's the guy
[13:53] come around with a little cute like
[13:55] little oh I'll let that go oh you can
[13:58] preach on that could you you yeah that's
[14:01] a father's responsibility is watch out
[14:03] for us keep watch over his family so
[14:05] that you know some of these little
[14:06] Slickers come around that uh maybe a
[14:09] little girl would be susceptible to the
[14:11] father's got to put that protective
[14:13] around anyway I'm I'm not here to preach
[14:16] I would just teaching
[14:18] now the womb he received the wrong seed
[14:22] word she received their own words
[14:24] because it all always starts out in the
[14:26] womb of your mind that's where it starts
[14:28] out first now listen real close now
[14:30] we're going to drive this right down at
[14:31] the Lord willing she received the wrong
[14:34] word what did it do
[14:36] it was Satan's lie said she would be
[14:40] wise
[14:41] and the God of this evil age brother
[14:43] Brown said oh you see we bring it over
[14:44] to the present day because a lot of
[14:46] times you read these you start studying
[14:47] these things how is it going to help me
[14:49] right now to know this historical uh
[14:52] thing or whatever
[14:53] if if we can begin to discern the to
[14:56] recognize the devil in his tactics to
[15:00] see when the devil's doing something
[15:01] then you'll you'll have overcoming power
[15:04] then to see when the devil begins to
[15:06] move maybe in the congregation or your
[15:07] family or when somebody says something
[15:09] that that's not right and you cast that
[15:11] down say no I'm sorry that's contrary to
[15:14] God's word and recognize when when the
[15:16] devil's moving and the God of this evil
[15:18] age he said eve never just simply walked
[15:21] out willfully say I don't believe in God
[15:24] she never just went well today I'm not
[15:26] going to believe it I don't believe in
[15:27] God anymore see it's more it comes in
[15:29] more subtle than that more simple it was
[15:32] an heir she believed it was an error
[15:35] Satan never come out and said oh well
[15:37] that's not even the word of God he
[15:38] admitted it was the word of God but he
[15:41] put his own interpretation to it which
[15:43] God plainly told him not to do it what
[15:46] does this do it makes a strong delusion
[15:48] for the Bible for the people to believe
[15:50] a lie and be damned by in second
[15:52] Thessalonians 2 11.
[15:55] and brother Brown said in the spoken
[15:56] word is the Original Seed he said that's
[15:58] there's the three now this is a
[16:01] fantastic quote there's the three Adam
[16:03] Christ God
[16:06] the reason that Adam's bride never did
[16:08] bare right the life child is because she
[16:11] disbelieved God's word
[16:15] if that's right say amen and everybody
[16:16] says amen
[16:18] the reason that Jehovah's wife was put
[16:20] away or his bride was because she
[16:23] rejected God's word the prophet
[16:26] and the reason that Christ's bride he's
[16:28] now he's talking about the Pentecostals
[16:30] they they hung on for a while but then
[16:32] they they just couldn't go on with the
[16:33] word the reason that Christ bride is put
[16:35] away in divorcement is because that she
[16:37] has rejected the word of God like Eve
[16:39] did like the rest of them all
[16:44] all polluted their husband couldn't get
[16:47] to him I see that it goes back to that
[16:50] second that second slide that I showed
[16:53] you got to be with the man
[16:55] you got to receive from the man because
[16:57] that's where the life comes from
[16:59] they was already pregnant for their
[17:01] husband got to them oh God if that ain't
[17:03] a pitiful sight think of a young man
[17:06] coming to a woman and find her with a
[17:07] seed of some other man in her what a
[17:09] thing that's what God has done that's
[17:12] what Adam done that's what Christ has
[17:14] done now now this next slide I want to
[17:16] look we're talking what we're talking
[17:18] about receiving a lie so you know
[17:20] brother Ram said that that the serpent
[17:22] seed came over the ark let's see what
[17:24] let's examine that quote a little bit he
[17:26] said now Noah and his sons would come
[17:28] out ham sham and japheth come out in the
[17:31] righteous line how did the seed ever get
[17:33] over how did it get over on the r
[17:36] the seed come over in the ark just like
[17:38] it did in the beginning through the
[17:40] woman their wives They Carried the seed
[17:43] of Satan through the ark just as Eve
[17:45] packed the seed of Satan to give birth
[17:47] to Cain through the woman now this is
[17:49] why it's so important to examine the
[17:51] context of what brother round was saying
[17:53] look at what he's saying before and
[17:55] after look what he says right after he
[17:57] starts talking about preaching he starts
[18:00] talking about telling somebody something
[18:01] that's wrong you put them women in your
[18:04] platforms for preachers the Bible
[18:06] condemning it Paul said If any man
[18:08] thinks himself to be a prophet or even
[18:10] spiritual let him acknowledge that what
[18:13] I write is the Commandments of the Lord
[18:15] but if he be ignorant just let him be
[18:18] ignorant
[18:20] and the serpent seat again he said and
[18:22] I'm just reading reading some I'm
[18:24] reading what brother Brown said he said
[18:26] notice this now and out of there can
[18:28] come ham with his wife and he had a
[18:31] curse put on him from ham come Nimrod
[18:33] who built Babylon out of Babylon come
[18:35] the Catholic Church the beginning of it
[18:37] come on down through Ahab Ahab and Judas
[18:40] and in this last day here is the spirit
[18:43] of the Antichrist and the spirit of the
[18:45] Christ what's the spirit of the
[18:46] Antichrist saying the days of Miracles
[18:49] has passed taken something that's true
[18:51] and twisting around so you think well
[18:53] God is not able to heal me God's not
[18:55] going to heal me anymore he don't want
[18:56] to he'd promise sitting for me see I'll
[18:58] just take it and twist it the spirit of
[19:00] Christ saying he's the same yesterday
[19:02] today and forever and the spirit of
[19:04] antichrist said and don't make any
[19:06] difference
[19:07] you see why preachers just hammer on it
[19:10] so many so much that it does make a
[19:12] difference what you believe it matters
[19:15] what you believe
[19:16] it don't let the spirit of antichrist
[19:18] saying it don't make any difference if
[19:20] you're baptized and the father son Holy
[19:22] Ghost poor sprinkled or whatever it is
[19:24] it means the same thing the Bible said
[19:26] that God's infallible and he can't
[19:29] change who you going to serve it's up to
[19:33] you
[19:35] I see all these things what we're
[19:38] talking about is receiving something in
[19:40] the womb of your in your womb
[19:43] and the spoken word is the Original Seed
[19:45] buildram said he said let's go back now
[19:46] and pick up again and come down for
[19:48] something
[19:49] you remember what last Sunday's service
[19:50] was the gate to the soul
[19:53] now there is a womb of the physical
[19:56] there's a womb for the spirit
[19:59] did you believe that there is a
[20:01] spiritual womb and a physical wound and
[20:05] the mind is the womb to the spirit now
[20:07] see if you really meditate on this and
[20:10] God reveals it to you then you'll see
[20:12] how to be born again you'll see how to
[20:13] receive any promise of God because the
[20:16] womb is the incubation place you let it
[20:19] you let God's word begin to incubate in
[20:21] your mind and you say I believe it and
[20:23] you hang on to it sooner or later you're
[20:25] going to have a baby born
[20:26] sooner or later there's going to be a
[20:28] baby crying you're going to be able to
[20:30] come forth but why because you you
[20:33] accepted what God's word says and you
[20:35] stayed with it until
[20:37] now and see there's a process you got to
[20:39] go through when you're when you're
[20:40] receiving the word of God God will take
[20:42] you through justification sanctification
[20:44] the little twitch and muscles muscles
[20:46] twitching babies not born again but then
[20:48] life comes forth and there you've got a
[20:50] little baby and you pop it on the bottom
[20:51] or whatever and it takes that breath and
[20:54] now now you got life
[20:56] and that's how babies born there's a
[20:59] womb a womb where that baby is being
[21:01] formed now that's what in second Timothy
[21:04] Paul telling Timothy he said consider
[21:06] what I say
[21:08] and the Lord give the understanding in
[21:10] all things consider what I'm telling you
[21:12] if all if we could do that this morning
[21:14] consider the things that it's not just
[21:16] something boring that's going over the
[21:17] pulpit but it's the it's the words of
[21:19] eternal life that you consider the word
[21:22] of God then something is going to happen
[21:25] in Mark chapter 4 verse 20 he said in
[21:28] Jesus these These are they which given
[21:30] the parable of the Soul or these are
[21:32] they which are sown on good ground a
[21:34] good ground somebody that will take
[21:36] God's word and hold it in the womb of
[21:38] their mind hold on to it until it comes
[21:41] forth and you can see it coming up out
[21:42] of the ground not just when it sprouts
[21:44] beneath the ground
[21:45] hang on let it incubate let it let it
[21:48] begin to grow until it comes forth and
[21:50] and and don't put a rock on it and don't
[21:52] let it get choked out by the weeds but
[21:54] hang on to it incubate it in that good
[21:56] ground
[21:57] and these are they which are sold on
[21:59] Good Grounds such as hear the word and
[22:01] receive it and bring forth fruit some of
[22:03] 30 folds some 60 and some 100 fold and
[22:06] Luke chapter eight now the parable is
[22:08] this the seed is the word of God you
[22:11] receive that seed hang on to it believe
[22:14] it and something's going to happen
[22:16] because it's a womb now brother Brown
[22:18] said in the spoken word is the Original
[22:20] Seed he said when the Bride of Jesus
[22:22] Christ let bless man-made Creeds and dog
[22:25] must take the place of the word of God
[22:27] she's committing adultery
[22:30] did not Jesus say whosoever to looketh
[22:33] Upon A woman has committed adultery with
[22:35] her already in his heart now now think
[22:38] about this when Jesus said you look on a
[22:40] woman
[22:41] you look on a woman with lust you're
[22:44] committing adultery in your heart why
[22:47] because that's the womb you're thinking
[22:50] about it you're thinking about it and
[22:53] something begins to move
[22:55] looketh upon a woman to lust after her
[22:57] heart it has committed adultery with her
[23:00] already he said why
[23:02] she let it come into his mind oh you see
[23:05] that's that's what's taking place when
[23:07] the woman goes out on the street or at
[23:08] the beach or wherever and she's
[23:09] unclothing herself she's trying to get
[23:11] she's trying to change that man's mind
[23:14] that looks at her because that's where
[23:16] it starts in your mind and a man looks
[23:19] on that woman and if he's not a Holy
[23:21] Ghost Field believer that that knows not
[23:23] to do that then his mind is going to
[23:25] start thinking about that because that's
[23:27] where it starts that's where everything
[23:29] starts in your mind and your mind is
[23:31] where the battle rages she let it come
[23:34] into his mind and that's that's why it's
[23:36] wrong sisters to dress wrong and to do
[23:38] to dress like that because you're trying
[23:39] to influence maybe this will go out on
[23:42] the Airways it's it's try you're trying
[23:44] to change what that man's thinking about
[23:46] that's the womb that starts the things
[23:49] moving now see it all goes back we
[23:52] haven't forgotten our our topic that
[23:54] we're talking about why did Abel offer
[23:56] blood
[23:57] because blood is the life it's the thing
[24:00] that you receive it all goes back to to
[24:02] to these things
[24:05] the womb is the the mind is the womb for
[24:08] the spirit to take in or let out and
[24:11] that's how they commit adultery it's
[24:13] taking let some Satan devil Spirit put
[24:16] in them something against the word of
[24:18] God then she's committed adultery
[24:21] and brother Graham said in the mark of
[24:23] the beast he said your heart is a womb
[24:25] you know what I'm speaking of women and
[24:27] men your heart is a womb and the womb
[24:29] holds the seed and the seed is the
[24:32] gospel now the seed alone in his heart
[24:34] now now look this it says I know this
[24:37] slide is a little heavy-handed as we as
[24:39] we y'all can grin and everything I see
[24:41] the greens we got two more minutes but
[24:44] listen this is what brother I'm saying
[24:45] you might have the egg there you might
[24:48] have the teaching where Gamaliel talked
[24:50] Paul for a year and Jesus taught the
[24:53] disciples for three and a half years the
[24:55] word is there laying but it's got to be
[24:57] it's got to be quickened no matter how
[25:00] many gamalias you set under no matter
[25:02] how great your pasture is how much
[25:05] you've read the Bible it'll never take
[25:07] life until the germ of life has come to
[25:10] it a woman's seed is a wonderful thing
[25:12] it's the building of a body but it has
[25:14] no life it can't it's impossible it has
[25:17] no life to begin with so now no matter
[25:21] how much you know the Bible and how well
[25:24] it is in your heart you're still a
[25:27] sinner what are we talking about we're
[25:30] talking about what happened in the
[25:31] garden and what Abel's Revelation was
[25:33] and the mark of the beast and we'll
[25:35] maybe we'll stop on this slide he said
[25:37] what happens the heart is a womb and
[25:40] Faith cometh by an open ear that's not
[25:43] been sealed by theology
[25:45] Faith cometh by hearing that's what
[25:48] we're talking about in Hebrews 11 faith
[25:50] to hear the word comes into the mind so
[25:53] if you want Faith this morning as
[25:55] brother Wade's preparing to bring the
[25:57] messages this morning and this afternoon
[25:59] faith comes by hearing when you hear the
[26:02] word open up yourself to receive the
[26:05] word and if you'll receive the he said
[26:07] well look he's given us the recipe he's
[26:09] saying you make up your mind about it
[26:12] is that right could that be right well
[26:15] the Bible said so I believe it
[26:18] down into the heart it goes then it's a
[26:23] womb when you receive God's word we'll
[26:25] stop right there God bless you
[26:30] [Applause]
[26:33] hey thank you
