got us now as we kind of speak about you remember the different ones that are not here they were on our trips and times Lord and the youth camps and the things and we pray that you'd bless each one never weighed over the burly's coming back in this afternoon from be with him and this lets us all together in your loving grace this afternoon as we try to speak about you we love you and we thank you forgive our sins cleanse us from all things we love you in Jesus name Amen John 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God in the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shine us in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not let's go over to which will be our thought for the afternoon and some scriptures and veins but revelations 13 8 now all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world you may be seated over that is blessing to the reading of the word now we know for sure talking about will be getting into the book of the Lamb we know that like in Daniel it says there's books and revelations that call them books there's many there's books that God is like records and stuff like that you know and you've got the part of like the book of life apart we'll be dealing with early things that transpire and then finally you get to the point of bringing it to eternal life but now remember that the book of the of the Lamb that was slain from the foundation of the world is the eternal Word of God all right it is a book of names and it will be there with not B it is the names of those that are the born-again believers upon the earth now there are books that will cover other things and you can have your name in the book of life like Judas was but that name can be removed with names cannot be removed from the Lamb's Book of Life the eternal section brother Branham in one statement mentions then talks about the book of the lamb slain and says Judas was dire and that was his but you've got to remember that he's putting you know it comes to be put together it has to be because you can't be in the the eternal section of the book because there's many sections or that one book and you can't have that your name could be in the eternal section and removed right what that ought to be settled even though you could find self quote to do this or that you got to remember truth his truth he's not there just something he's missing or we're missing to understand and I'd rather say we are but that's that's alright but that's what we're going to try to deal with for a little bit because our thoughts has been and I'm try this afternoon to do some of what I was doing this morning is it's just quoting things without having to read without reading so much but we will cover some things but what I want to do is to think about what the Bible covers then we've been speaking out for two or three weeks on this one thought that there was some things taking place in heaven before the foundation of the world all right we know in for surety that we were not back dire so we put that in upfront as peoples and identities in the situation's and we'll read it after a while and the Prophet said not our being here that's not it and he said that they asked him where we spirits back there and he says no you were nothing you would only in the mind of God all right so before the foundation of the world you'll be dealing with the mind of God and we found that what have we studied talking about the self existing one that dwelt along with his thoughts all right see then in his mind as we covered this morning surely then we can comprehend if there is a God or it and if not we might we'll go and forget it if you just don't believe that God is so eternal and his thoughts are eternal and in the basis that he could never even have a new thought he can't change his mind his thoughts are perfect and eternal was he then being that then surely we would be able to think about do we try to limit God to put him to wordid he was he would not know before the world ever begun everything that would ever happen on earth and every person that would be here ever than that that would be here and every time that mattad that it's our infinite things that God can deal with surely we want to realize that he is the self existing one and that he dwelt along with those stocks which the Prophet says on who is just Melchizedek he talks about his desires alright attributes what is an attribute we were talking about this morning so you are the attribute of your parents you know that's that's attribute attribute covers many thoughts in the form that that attribute can just be a desire of a person or something and certainly you don't sit around and think I mean what do you do all day long you get up in the morning cut it off and run your brain all day to keep them overheating you know and cut it back only once why when you need it or is it working all the time if it's working all the time then you're doing some thinking well when I think about God being that way are you going to limit him to where that he would not be thinking so then my point lately has been to dry to drive to the reality of a living God to word that we can see that even though we would sum up the point of by way of the prophets message or something that he dwelt alone and and there was nothing there with him but his thoughts surely then we think about that in his mind that he would know everything that would ever happen on this earth in any form well then you know that would if you don't listen to the talks I might sometimes I don't know they hit for me anyway if he knows ever not that ever bad it's I and he knows every person ever live in the world well you know what he's busy before the world he wasn't you sitting around he got in order to do I don't know what to think about you no longer know he had a lot to think about he said well he just thought about like well it may be true but what if he enjoyed his college what if he fellowship with that point of thinking oh maybe we'll get to it in a minute where the that Jesus told him he had fellowship with him before the world but yet not his pre-existence we don't believe in pre existence and souls they don't believe in pre existence of spirit but I firmly believe in pre existence yes of eternal life I believe in that so when the prophet said we always was eternal he's certainly not talking about our physical anatomy of body spirit and soul in the basis of the human that we are so why would you need a redeemer if it was anyway all right so then we know that he knows everything all right and knowing everything then let's don't limit him to bring in him I'm trying to make him real to you but not limiting him to me the greater the more he unveils of himself the greater God gets to me no that's the way I think the more I can see that he has unveiled on through and brought it out to being like it is that makes me more knowledgeable of how really is and how much greater that it can continue on to be that even the Prophet would say that after this world will receive a message you cheer down through the endless ages it's not going to be setting up in heaven well well God before the world was like this so now we're like this you know it setting around no it's going to be a wonderful time I had a brother know that I'm sorry I always hated for him to tell something you know even though I might enjoy what he was telling me but it was the way he told it your life and someone because you probably know what I'm talking about on that he would tell you he got up that morning ate breakfast had three eggs two Bacon's and biscuit and then he'd do and then after a while he finally get in the car in his story see he'd be telling you the whole day would finally get in his car at nine o'clock and he'd drive 15 miles to games was a cat cross the road and had to watch the hitch we had to do he told everything and then he finally got to the doctor's office at 10 o'clock and then the doctor came in to the nurse came first you understand what I mean you ain't never been around nobody like that you want to push flight forward right come on come on now speed it up with a little bit better I don't think God was that I don't think we'd get bored with listening to God explain a lot of things to you I don't think we will in the life I love to hear testimonies I love to read you some of you write me letters and things you know and tell me your testimonies of different things I enjoy reading them and I enjoy hearing your testimony of your life and what God means to you because that's part that's something that's that's a part of the mind and I enjoy all right now but get older thinking about it now the God we're talking about dwelt alone with his attributes those attributes he desired to be a savior he desired to be a healer he decided to be God he desired to be father he desired to be all of those things but none of those things were displayed so it would not bring him into a materialistic way in thinking it would be just him thinking in his mind now to illustrate that we're going to maybe not today but we will eventually see you've got to deal with a creation of a beginning and things in more than just to think something begin this that you've got to deal with it in the basis of see brethren said the first time God created was angels okay then we got quote now what about the quote where he said the first thing was God himself first creation was God inside what are you getting at I'm getting at there's two separate creations we will eventually cover one of them is literal things are something to more tangible whereas this other part is God unfolding himself as he comes down all right and then that way just don't get them crossed over and try to figure out what this has got to happen before this happens just remember what we're saying in his first physical or part creation that does not deal with his own nature doorways is that much as angels they worship it made him God okay but see then God Himself condescending into creation and bringing you and I into being it will bring you to a position of seeing eternity because the angels are not eternal the world is not eternal as we said the other day everything God ever thought it was not necessarily eternal well he thought of a lot of things this world is not eternal he thought of all of the time it's not eternal but then his thoughts of you and I are eternal we just remember one thing the thought he had of this world even though it's not eternal he can never add one thought to that because his thought is eternal it's just what he thought of is not eternal so he thought of angels they're not eternal so you can see a creation as it begins to come into being in the world and people and then but then you can see over on the other side to follow the line of God of understanding right now keep that in your thoughts let it run around and around in your head alright you are an attribute of your father because you're part of your father all right now your mind as it's working your mind you think of your children and you even think of children before they come you thought you named your babies right I mean you come in and say what's the baby will you know I don't like this new modern age where you know all about the baby how big it's going to be and everything else I enjoyed the fact of it waiting to the guy here and then come out and droves it I liked it anyway I don't like this well they're going to be this and going to be that you might be like there were people over in Banks County one day that they set them all up in the family and it was all going to be a girl or something and you know what you want them had a boy I just dread awaked okay but listen you dwell with your thoughts is I always say you're setting that right now some are saying well we got to do this when we get home we got to do that leave it on or wash your clothes they're going to do this the kids are going to do that your fellowshiping with your ethology and when I'm sitting there I do the same thing so I'm not blaming you okay I'm just being honest so you're not honest with me and said no I don't do that brother Jeffries one time he told me he learned how to fix the tractor and think it would while I was preaching I said well it must have been a great sermon but now listen God dwelt alone with his stalks and then a word as a thought expressed its first a thought then it's a word you remember that we kept trying to bring it out see my point is God was not just sitting back wherever you want to make him whatever I say just used the word heaven before the foundation of the world God wasn't sitting just back in heaven and cuddling and not nothing to do no it was a very busy person because he was planning everything I don't mean that he started to plan it this way no that won't work yeah this will work so we leave that one out of it no no his thoughts are eternal he didn't do this but he knew that's the way I love the Word of God you ain't never you ain't never stood in the with a word maybe to the point that you knew that that person you're talking to had no way to answer what you just said because he trapped their own selves you had never thought it out like that as you present it you know you know what I do a lot of times when I'm talking to people I'm listening to tapes you you know what I mean I'm listening to the way brother branham explained that I'm thinking over how he explained so-and-so and Jones or the Trinity or the one God is I'm thinking about that you know come to find out it gives you a lot of good answers because it worked back tyre to work now all right so then we we do dwell with our own thoughts our thoughts are wonderful it's not daydreaming you know daydreaming is you don't have nothing to do daydreaming no I enjoy thinking about brother let's see brother Quinn because right where the Queen was at the house one time and we were all sitting around there and all the kids get together and they get to picking on each other and telling things that happened you know or something you know that one of them done or this one done or whatever you know you know you know you just get a good life and when you look at Zack you know he's always been he wanted a little bit sorry chunky news for a good little boy well Hannah and Josh and and Matthew they would pick on him and I just pick on him and they pick on him and he kicked out boomer won't know well you know what would happen after a while you hear guys and Here Come three kids running through the house and here comes act with a ball that during any of them to slow down even though here's a whole lot smaller well see you can do that you can think about think about your life and were you being anything about that deer up there and Kansas when you seen it coming down as well with your thoughts we'll see that's the way card doulas only his thoughts is about you and I he's not thinking about his salary thinking about you even though okay he's thinking about what he will do when time came for him to do it is that about as good a statement you can make the guard before the world was sitting thinking of what he would do before a time came that he could do it that's a wonderful talk come see he had that in his mind and in his mind he knew what a wonderful God we serve that had in his mind what all of this would be about and you're not gonna change his mind that was what was so much this morning right I'm guarding I changed not he's nothing he's not gonna change his mind to fit me in you you said well in the Bible's our this guy asked fifteen years and got it ain't here he's gonna give it to him forever when the world ever started so he didn't change his mind it just looks like to mankind he didn't know he changed nothing honey so he wasn't alone as we think as he dwelled with his thoughts he was dwelling with his star how real is that how real is it for you to dwell with your thoughts I Creighton wonderful it is should we do that when we think about the things that you and I would be thinking of and then we speak it it's not just for that and you know fanaticism zand and ideas and all like that but see what we're talking about now is that in heaven whatever you want to call the place you can go that there was many things taking place in God's mind that he recorded in the word that was taking place back there about that one he recorded in the word that it was going to take place because in his mind it was already taking place it just hadn't come into reality yet what a better wonderful card what about a savior and God I told them we wouldn't if I call for now full of quotes and things but if not we'll just go with some thoughts Matthew 13 and 35 says that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets saying I'll open my mouth in parables I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world who got new secrets that had been kept secret of what unless in the world Matthew 25:34 then shall the King say unto them on the right hand come you blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world old things are already pre-prepared not in order yeah but that makes God just stamping it out so you're not listening cannot list me John 17 and 24 Father I will that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world a lot of things going on before the foundation the world what about Ephesians 1 and 4 according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love who quote in a minute where the Prophet was saying that Jesus has evidently the John which is really where Jesus told her disciples said I had a you with me in the beginning we had a wonderful time if you'll take right what we've read just above there you have it with the glory that he had before the foundation of the world what about Hebrews four and three said we have believed that by entering into life although the works were finished see if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world yes it even started this already over what about first Peter 1 in 20 Hoover Li was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you he was fully for ordained before the world for less there was a lot going on before the foundation of the world before there was anything that had been created of any form where God was dwelling alone that's the point I'm trying to get you to see get you to see a reality of what was taking place before that you even think about a world you see what does that what do we need that far I don't know you just could it all could I really enjoy I enjoy the fact of thinking about some things before the world you know what I might just be part of it I saritha enjoyed I have a good time thinking about it and if I don't believe it was me before the foundation world Who am I going to believe it wise now think about it we're going to cover if we get time three basic lineups of the scriptures 3 like scriptural point and each one of these points we're going to be talking about something taken place in glory before the world ever begun and surely if the Bible said in the mouth of two or three witnesses let everything be established so then if we can look back before the world what I don't know whatever I won't know what's happening now you're not listening what's happening now was thought of before we got here this is the fulfillment of the thoughts when we get down to the little scripture in a minute see it might be right where you're sitting right now what you're doing right now might be the very thing that got in his mind I believe it is I mean I'm not saying might be I'm just putting that point to you surely if we believe anything at all or to know that God by foreknowledge would know ever every person would be sitting here today I never thought you're having and what you're done a night you got ready to come and how you done there's me done that surely we would think that God is infinite is after the word that he would know all of those things within you know what he just might get away from and we might get away from thinking so much about that and come to find out this is what God saw and if this is what he saw it might be excuses the controlling factors right here are you going to think maybe tomorrow I'm going to be this and when I get to that I'll do I talk we believe the Bible what does the Bible say about salvation it says today is the day of salvation it doesn't say yesterday or tomorrow it says today is the day of salvation that's why I've always tried to get us to see anybody in the Bible you remember this few weeks ago anybody in the Bible ever amounted to anything whatsoever was somebody by faith that realized what God was doing right then right then not doing later or what he had done so that's what we want to do we want to look back and see what God done for somebody else we want to look forward and see what God will do for somebody else and failing to see what he's doing for us right now you might find out this it was more important than we think that we're just thinking with it you know we need to know about the Lord well how much more do you need to know about the Lord now it simply means you want a sugar to a doctor and you're wanting something that doesn't take thinking about to where that can cut you can comprehend it you're wanting something that's a baby form instead of wanting to grow up in Christ but 100 I mean we've been around here 50 years you can play around and keep 50 more coming up at years into profit look why do you think we've been here 50 years don't you think he knows you see I don't blush that on people because it don't do any good they're going to help nothing anyway you know what I should have said in 1974 when I stood in this pulpit and said according to the Bible in the prophets message we could pass the Year 2026 and not break the Bible nor the prophets message I should have said that's thus saith the Lord you don't believe it you're the ones got to deal with it I'm not that hateful but you know what we're getting close you know what are your dates and times that you've had before has gone off the scene I don't want to be that form of something to try to dry something I want you to believe you know when the end of the world is going to come when you and I come to the place that in God's mind he knew where we would be I just can't see it as real as you do brother there will I come what aren't you talking about an eternal God I come what's the part what's the problem but Randleman talking about the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world said when the lamb was slain every person that was ever to be saved was associated with the lamb in the sleigh before the foundation of the world estimation surge we would see Jesus in 1957 what about that ever person and we can bring it to the books on that so he won't get confused and think about it you know that even the person who receives eternal life he's connected into the book of life because there's a section there that he can be in and even to be given eternal life so the whole thing is associated with Jesus Christ Jesus Christ paid the price for everybody in the Old Testament right is what was the New Testament for everybody that would ever receive eternal life it is an association with him how much more is it with his family his offspring his children how much greater is it for that who do you understand then like we gave the scriptures of all dealing with before the foundation of the world the Prophet said on the message the baptism of the Holy Spirit he's talking about when Christ was slain he said when was the lamb slain he said two thousand years ago and he saw he said maybe a hundred million years ago before the foundation of the world was ever formed Jesus Christ died for our sins well now how I give religious when was the Lamb's Book of Life to that cause really technically doesn't say louse book of life it says the book of the lamb slain we use it and to say the book of life you know the book of the lamb slain it all right but when was it written before the foundation of world well all right we've got a couple of million years from the right names and many people have been in the world since the beginning it's seven billion now how many people have been in the world a seven billion right now how many been in the world and he's been in the world before the flood and he's bending all of the honey how many billions of names are they they heard you're playing dumb I agree with here because my Bible said the name was written before the foundation of world and what how was it written well he took me any brother how was it written I thought that it was a book of names and I thought it was written in the blood of Jesus Christ am i right I mean is it true the night that the Lamb's Book of Life section is the eternal sack written in the blood of Jesus Christ yeah but he had even died yet does that have anything to do with it it would eventually come to where he would but does that have anything to do with what I'm talking about the God before the world look how long it would take him to right everybody's name I'm trying to get you to see God as real and if before the world ever begun any thoughts that he's more real there's more real bad it is here that he's riding with riding names well I just don't think he danowitz well what was he doing well I think he was writing names well he ain't no book well Brett around said there was a book and said it went back I'm quoting him he said turn the garden when senator the picture he said the book back I went back said he couldn't go to the hands of the devil said he went to God who gave it he must have had a book oh we look at this we look at it and Bible that's fine to look at it as a Bible because it's Bible is a book it's a book of names Loretta said now wait a minute he said now Armand Neville might not be written enough he said was written in their world island during our time armored nibbled on earth with our bodies that are man Devils written in the book you don't think about that in your name what I'm so glad about is to find out right around them taught us what if it might not be Danny found might not be James Colley he said it would be the name that was written before the foundation of the world we talk about a new name maybe it'd be good to find out whether our name is earned on and if it is it might not be our name physically Samuel Dale right now I'm trying to get you to see the reality of a living God how real he really is how long would it take him to write a book of all the names then he's got books to write after then because remember the Bible was written before the founders were all right that's in God's mind it was no physical writing it took quite a while for the hand write the Bible right remember that the books that's a record that God wanted to keep all right so when was the lamb slain 2,000 years ago no millions of years ago in God's mind the lamb was flying though something's going on don't was taking place in heaven then why did God the infinite God ever permits in the Prophet said in what he said little words were you and I could come he permitted the devil to come into being you didn't make him the devil he permitted him to come into being knowing he would be used to running the fall and knowing the fall would bring up I said he could be a healer he could be a savior he could be a redeemer he could be fathered by natural physical creation where I create without you know sin he could be a god because the Angels would worship Him and the word God but he couldn't be healer Savior thing so it allows the devil to come into being so it could be brought to Pais what that did he had it in mind that wouldn't pull an over on him poor old fella you said I just hate that devil too bad I don't hate it or don't know and realize he'll never be saved you mean you're wanting somebody to not be safe why would you be that way I'd like to be able to see him safe but they were warned why because he was that in the beginning before the foundation of the world we see the Bible telling us according to Revelation 13:8 that something was taking place before the world ever begun that he was writing the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world he said what I did I can't see it because all I think about is it's just not him doing something no you realize everything he thought of dollars gonna take place on earth if he thought of it taking place here you see why do I care about getting to be present in was it matter to me if they put to Hill or busy I told you that when they started doing I said I wish they'd put palin and hilary both of men remember that back hunter would see everybody but window when the woman gets in the white house then we'll be ready to go well what the prophet said back there you ought to listen to he said it's all ready to hire let's see we don't want to add we want it's got to be a set time well when this takes place we'll be ready then oh we're okay until the woman gets in the white house well that's really good ain't it are we going to do set around twiddle our thumbs and wait on the bush to pull up until the woman gets in the white house yeah a Russia comes after all see we're limiting God to a situation that we need to get away from the prophet of God talks about his name and how that his name not only Christ was slain to take away sin but your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world God wrote your name associated with his so that's not Samuel do you remember the Bible speaks up we were on it the other way you've got a name that nobody knows but themselves you can't tell nobody you can't tell nobody on you now which I can Paul I'm kinda handsome but remember it's associating with him remember we read you scripture what that we were chosen in him when when was we chosen I accepted Jesus Christ an altar that was wonderful I was when it was transmitted down here but in God's mind where did it come from in God's mind you just as eternal if God is if you ever will be eternal but if you never will be eternal they don't worry about you're not going to get it anyway whatever to be associated with him because you were his attributes you don't remember it from the message who is this milk editing page 54 you don't remember it but because you're just a part you don't remember it no because you're just a part of his life you are a part of God when you become the son and daughter of God part of his life what was back before the foundation of the world and the writing sure they would have to be a thought of a record of all the world and what would take place which original one that was written was written in the Lamb's Book of Life or the book of the life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world so you got that going on in heaven do you realize what I'm getting at it took four thousand years it took four thousand years to bring into being Christ dying on the cross but are you with the prophet of what he would saying he said when he died God's mind before the world he said it was the same as any reality you would ever think of he said it's already settled and complete it wasn't going to get for nails to hold him to across and we'd say they put three why because they said it would be three what about the things that are written in the Bible that we can depend on and realize that things will happen what about the Bible we talked about those things when the Bible was talking about that the wind the Towers fall the light of the Sun would be as the light of the Moon and the light of the other one of them is seven times four we looked right in the word and there's the towers followed what about in the Bible when they found the scroll and they stood before the water gate I'm quoting scripture and read the scroll kind of an odd statement of how that the Word of God came into being through the mouth of a prophet before Watergate came into being in the life stage we wanted to relate something like that because it tantalizes our thoughts it makes us think when Russia comes after all so we just watch Russia until they start moving at all we might we're wrong that's not the way God is saying it [Music] listen to what he said on as long as our decent church age it was God's purpose to bring forth of people like unto himself that would be a word bride she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him she was for known and beloved before she was ever brought forth during the ages upon the earth she was redeemed by his blood and can never come into condemnation before the world it would brother Dale what I'm getting the idea of you now you know I'm getting the ideas that you're trying to make things going back that away more real than what we are now well you're getting it just right I'm glad you thought of that I'm glad you finally thought of that idea because that's exactly what I'm talking about you showed that was just in his mind within in his mind is more real than anything we could ever think of right you saw every member I'll show you what Ron said even the color you're higher was dark her before the foundation of the world written in the book of the life of the lamb slain he knew every wound everything he's Mike oops I'm sorry just be human but he knew all it would take place upon there we're just now I'm being fulfilled in that probably said when did he die he said we say he died sometimes here he said he died millions of years before the foundational world he's old that was just in his mind are you gonna tell me your mind is greater than his mind are you going to tell me you and my peanut brain is going to outtake an eternal God that knows why never thought you would ever think while we thinking he knows it the better reality of a living God like that because they asked him the question questions and answers 59 where we spirits might die he said no that we wouldn't nothing he goes on down to the bottom and said we're only figuratively in his mind he said we were in his mind oh wait I just believed I was back you see him in the message you know I remember Napoleon you know Bonaparte Napoleon got you know he kind of believed it was sometime well we like that I just feel like I was back there I just feel that I was before the world feel what sorry to be the blunt give me a piece of ice I'll bring you some feelings he says that's silly another statement but it's truth didn't it what his feelings got to do with it when the Word of God says it the Word of God said he died before the foundation of the world why the Bible said we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world so it's not whether or not I'm chosen it's whether or not he was chosen right I'm not depending on my goodness to make me chosen I'm depending on the fact of what he said did I believe it who's chosen in him he said we're just one of these attributes he knows what your name would be he knowed the color of your fire you would have he knowed all about you only thing happen is in when you was a sinner you turned back from it so before the foundation of the world and you would be there he knew you by name and so this is carry him by name before the foundation of the world he said think of it many times we sing that song a new name written down in glory you know the song you know there's a new name written down in glory he said let's see if this is the one I've got one where he said to take when they wrote that he said no doubt singing that song listen to brendham no doubt singing that song when you name was written down in glory he said a lot of people got converted you need that now I'll find it I thought it was right dark house you're fine he said good it ain't true and he said people would get converted them singing that song but it's not true he said it was written before the foundation the world that's how real he could be about it thoughts of what we could be weary spirits we were not even nothing questions and answers in 59 only figuratively in his mind so if we wasn't spirits back there we surely ain't going to be placed back there are we I don't mean to tell it in sarcastic ways or two but we were talking one time about and sitting in our house and I remember it and this sister just heard a little bit about the messaging and her husband and they were there talking and it was brought up about how that we were going to get a new body you know this this body would be redeemed and I'm honest to think I'm sorry I'm human she said you mean we're gonna get a new body we explained you know not new like we thank you but this body read it and she said well I'd hate you to put out her thoughts right about that time because I kind of believe her thoughts is in the line that she was thinking about this is gonna giving you and I ain't gonna be little like I am now so irate but human that make you think it's not silly talk it's a reality of a living God and how eternal his thoughts are and how that he saw before the world ever begun what it would take place what we would be alright our scripture number one scripture number one we've covered the book of life over the life of the land before the world all names were written before the world God knew all it would ever be saved and all that ever be lost he knew all of that in his mind in the only way we was back tyre was not just be standing with him we were in him there's the difference and when we get down in the little while because see everybody wants to be into my if I was just in the mind of God or with something if I just I said then the same thing I say now I don't want to be in the mind of God because Judas Iscariot was in the mind of God and walked with the Lord Jesus and had signs and wonders falling in annointed I don't want to be in God's mind I want to be a part of God's mind I want to go back Pais just something he taught us so I'm not talking about you something he thought of I want us to think about going all the way back into his very mind the Bible said let the mind that was in Christ being you it will make you a new creature right I thought it'd be great to be in his mind well what if he thought about you being lost remember this one way or the other maybe what you want to say in his mind it was one way or the other and he'll never change it why don't you just try to be part of the mind so now here's the story's gonna have to catch and hold onto remember when I said it wanted them creation the first creation was angels your prophet said catenin then the other quote is his first creation was God himself two lines of creation there's no story to the end of what you're talking about so don't even get it any mind just remember you turn a life it's a part of God you agree if the fact is it's easy on the one s eternal she's in the only way you can have eternal life or have his own life in you the only way we can be eternal was to be a part of God in the beginning not something he thought of if he thought of it he's got to give us eternal life so then you couldn't be before the foundation world when he thought of me when I'd come to earth him and receive the new part amen but remember in his mind you already had it that's why if you'd read it and take the message anyway folks predestination is a very simple message predestination is very simple the Bible tells you how simple it is which comes first read estimation or for knowledge the Bible tells you it says those who he foreknew he did predestinate so predestination will come first you know you don't deal with stuff like that to me but that's you don't think about the way I think see I want to know which one comfort just like God and attributes and time which comes first before it can be words but rather said it had to be a thought he said it had to be a thought for could be an attribute well which one first thought wheel into the murderer when it was okay you may not matter to you but it sure does to me okay so now let's go into thinking a little bit further recovered number one we covered revelations 13 8 let's read it a little scripture we will read this one brothers would be a number 12 let's read the scripture and see something that was taking place in heaven before the foundation of work what the Bible says well that's the title of the message too we're washed out there what he asked Joe when I laid the foundation of the world the klar if thou has to understand it now if you'll take this for the background out of it and show the whole point of it LeBron said the only thing God had against Joe so job was just a little bit self-righteous you study the message I'll be glad to show you he had to lift it up just to her so when he's lifted up just to her God says to him hey wait a minute oh boy you just got live to do it because you like it because all the guys come to you remember Joey don't read the Bible he enjoyed going to town because the young man and everybody come to him and listen to him because it's a little bit too raised up he slaps him down because he says where what style you think you got the answer to all these guys asking you questions he said let me ask you a question for what style when I laid the foundations there the choir has died to understand it who has laid the measures thereof if not knows or who has strength stretched the line upon it we're a poner the foundation dareth isand or who laid the cornerstone their hood when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy Joe Borgia where were you at while the angels were shouting in the son's room I mean singing and the Son of God shouting for joy where was you at job he was just showing him that he could speak of the things but he was not a born-again believer so he could not enter therein to understand the full story after a while he catches at least soon and he said I know my Redeemer liveth he begin to catch on brother and said he told him said stand up Jobe begin to speak from the inner man and bring out a lot of great truths but he's asking him where we had okay number one revelation 13:8 covers the book of life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world okay number two look what was happening in heaven what was this acted this was in heaven the morning stars were seen the sons of God shouted for joy in the morning stars are the angels okay is that we do I need to bring the quote the Angels I'll give you the quote words in here the Brethren said the Angels sang first in heaven before the foundation of the world when the morning started saying together and Sunda God shouted for joy and he said then they sang the second time when Jesus Christ come forth as a child what are the Angels what does the Bible speak of angels it says they're ministering spirits or what reason they're made to be helpers and I'm quoting in this office to hire v-club they're made to be helpers for those that are redeemed now quote brother Branham only the redeemed of angels we don't have all this stuff you know that you've got a baby over here you've got an angel hanging out over that's alright just make sure you don't have a female angel floating around because that's what they all want right cause ain't no female angels so that sells there but listen where was that when I laid the foundation of the world the choir if you can understand when the morning stars sang together in the sons of God shouted for joy where were you brother Branham you still serving that new religion he said nope I'm preaching the oldest religion that ever was he said I'm preaching about where was you when I laid the foundation of the world when the morning stars sang together in the sundar - God shouted for joy millions of years before the foundation of the world just put them brother I heard brother so-and-so bringing it out like that and he brought pre-existence well I'm not brother so-and-so okay so I'm not talking about pre-existence of nothing but eternal life not pre-existence of people or spirits or ideas or whatever no it's pre-existence of eternal life we've done established at the last book of the life of the lamb slain before the foundation world it's a book of the redeemed those with eternal life now we're looking back and seeing that while that was taking place the names were being written it's when job was shown the angel singing and the sons of God shouting for joy it's off the message witnesses off the message the serpent seed he's talking about and we're taught that in the Blessed word that we had fellowship with him before the foundation of the world when the morning stars sang together in the Son of God shouted for joy way back before the foundation of the world how do we know that that wasn't at the same time that the lamb was slain that when God in His great thinking seen those shouting and rejoicing in our salvation through Jesus but you you sound too much like pre-existence that's all you can do without taking my word part or what I always talk because this has been 40 something years that I've been teaching this way it's great went into pre-existent yet I believe in pre existence of eternal life God is the only one that can pre-exists you and I don't pre exist unless we can find ourselves in him the Bible said being found in him having not our own righteousness let's read easing in will give at all also in paragraph a it was paragraph one pair of eighty to the serpent seat said when the morning stars saying together the sons of God shouted for joy who were those sons of God that were shouting for joy Jesus told them I had joy with you before the foundation of the world he told her disciples and he had joy with them with them before the foundation of the world were they devack then were they saved just because that was taken blood the rejected King it comes down to a long story but didn't think enough right down at the bottom it says he talking about what organization our religion the earlier he said that was only about two hundred years ago that organization listen but this organization started when the sons of when the morning stars saying together the sons of God shouted for joy when they seen the coming of a savior to redeem mankind this is taking place for the foundation of the world make sure getting busy back there if you understand what I'm eating a lot of things are taking place adoption 1960 no wonder when the morning stars saying to get in the sons of God shouted for joy when they seen the plan of salvation God putting your name on the book before the foundation of the world what about it I was back there with him if I've got eternal life spiritual amnesia 64 I was back there with him if I got eternal life was there with him I was identified with him when the morning stars sang together in the sons of God shouted for joy so what was back there if I have eternal life he said if you have eternal life right here today then that eternal life you have was in God before the foundation work because it's God's own life is that sensible about it well we're not a denomination he talked about the Morningstar Sangha he said they're my angels and everything was happy shouting about it before there was a foundation of the world how is the devil ever going to keep me in the dust of the earth they can't do it what am i dependent upon what about it the Prophet said that it was when they saw the plan of redemption they were shouting for joy we're getting into the third third scripture in just a second but remember where we're at we're back before the foundation of the world with scripture number two as the sons and daughters of God shouting for joy I thought we understood from the Bible that even the devil knew the plan of God to a degree and he knew how to mess it up in the garden I thought even he understood to a degree you know why because he was anointed sure of that stood beside the Lord what made he messed up was he just couldn't understand the devil just never could understand because he felt he was the right-hand man because he was the one standing beside the Lord what maybe mad you'd never think like that what made the devil mad and get him all bloated up and all this happening is when Michael stepped out one day and Michael is Christ and Lucifer was never given the opportunity to speak a world into existence but Michael did yeah well wait a minute Michael for the run said Michael is Christ so okay we solved the problem Michaels Christ he's not an angel he's Christ it's listed as an angel to where you cover it with your beings and serve Him you see when the devil got all upset he was the right-hand man but when things started coming towards this away and his plan began to unfold God's plan beginning on the foe see the devil was right there listening and as he was listening he was thought he was going to be part of it but then all at once sure stepped out Michael he found out real quick that he was not the right-hand man he found out he did now the position he thought he had so he got upset may I even quote go random that Satan has a knowledge of the principles of life is it true he new sees it all he had to do was get that serpent the Beast and Eve together and it would cause the fall he knew that was the only one could cause it he knew the monkey couldn't Mitch he had a knowledge of the principles and he knew that there's those two creations issued yet my friend Adam said it he first created angels amen he said God was his first creation in and out of him can the logos from from the low guys came to man well I'm just gonna take this one okay because you're not gonna listen the rest of the story the words your plan of redemption and what could be a reality of sons and daughters of God shouting for joy well it looks like son dog had be back on what is what do you that's looking at where we are right now safety knew God was making a plan he explained it God did because remember the story Angels created first they worshipped him made him God that's not that don't make them angels eternal they don't have anything to do with the plan of salvation except there are your helpers which are assigned to you after you get here in the Needham for what if it is that the sons and daughters of God somebody give me the day you were born again the day is born against you know what just a day for a time what if that's what God saw what if he was looking down here and he saw you shouting no no it's got to be back garlic see now now you're getting women in store you're gonna push it back dark but don't get all the stories anyway what if he's seeing the day you accepted him as your Savior he's not that what he saw in his mind is he not looking at you shouting over your salvation we were singing that song this morning you know and it's thinking it when you take that song you know god is good and then you pick it up and you bring it up into a higher form and see you can see that there's more to the story right what if you look down and seeing a shot in this morning are you not agreeing that to write the book of life that he would look down and see you accepting Jesus Christ as your Savior right would not be the day you receive Jesus Christ as your Savior that your name was written in heaven no now wait a minute see now you're transferring back before the foundation world I can quote brother Branham what do you like it or not I've been around too long everybody says your name goes on the book as a believer in sanctification but that's not the Lamb's Book of Life section that's the book of life section it's not eternal section but it does go on as a belief that's why Judas is named could be honored a believer because he comes through sanctification what are you saying what if God is looking down and seeing us right now what if this is what he saw what if he saw you shouting over your salvation everyone said it was the time what if it is that there was something happening in heaven that I won't have time to cover this part about it or take number three scripture it says in Genesis 1:26 and 27 let us make man in our own image after our likeness and let them have dominion over it there's another scripture that was before the foundation of the world God said let us make man you say oh no that was over here on the sixth day that's the physical man it's a physical man of Genesis 2 it is created in Genesis 1 physical on the sixth day eternal life never had no beginning it has no engine showing you what happened before the world a lot your name is written on the Lamb's Book of Life or the lamp of the land and life of the Lamb I'm showing you shouting for glory over your religion you've had your salvation seeing the plan of salvation come into view that you could shout about it and God look all the way down and see that and say Amen what if he was explaining to what he was just sitting around and explaining to the angels you know part of my plan is he said well the devil knew the plan whatever to get to plane what if it was that he was explaining to the angels what he was going to do and explaining what would happen to those angels explain what they would do and how they would have a part to do with you and I what if he was explaining that to him that's what he had in his mind but he was explaining what would take place thousands of years later when you would receive it there's a lot going on in glory so Genesis 1:26 man is not a physical man earth creation would God himself then God created man in His image if you have eternal life he was in glory before the world ever begun see we've got to wait to get it you're on earth just like Jesus Christ is the lamb slain before the foundation of the world that had to wait for a thousand years ago to come into reality it was only spoken off until he died on Calvary and when he died on Calvary he sealed in the whole claim what if it is that he's enjoying your salvation I thought the Bible said that there was joy in heaven the Angels over what over one sinner who come for their rejoicing the angels are rejoicing because now they know they got something to do they're going to be able to come to earth what if the story is you're getting it what if God was sitting down explaining to the angel didn't like what he was going to do he's any problem with that and then he just brings on into reality the world and the life Satan takes his side and pulls it off but yet we come into the world and we accept him as our Savior what caused you to accept him as your Savior what was the plan what was the thing only the redeemed have angels all little babies don't have angels we see we want to put that up and night stories out of it it's a redeemed that have angels they're assigned to you and even before you accepted Jesus Christ that angel would be there and he'd take care of you and I quote vertebra he said thanks a little bit something different about you he said don't you remember when everybody else for me to get out in the world oh come on use it said everybody else want to get out in the world something he knew just held you but brother dad I can't so shake that because the devil got me and I went that's you between you and God I've told you my life story and I don't have to back up part I've told it for 4050 years when I was a sinner I would go out and do things wrong or say something wrong and I felt dirty I felt unclean I knew no God to confess my sins - but I felt dirty it was something wrong I didn't like it but I walked to the altar when I was 18 years old I said I want to know about God I had seen him when I was 11 years old in a Baptist Church standing at the altar I wanted to know about him I asked the people you know what old Baptist Deacon told me one day cause out of deacon at 23 years old and you know that's it that's not that's too old too young to be a deacon in a church the I asked her talking that dick and he said you need to go to some Pentecostal church for his old I you know I didn't know it that's what order does cuz they had more move I would ask people about God and the ways of doing back then I didn't back off like I told you before we were standing there one day and a visiting group of people was coming in the young girls were singing the choir and they were getting off the bus this old deacon was watching them get off the bus and he's watching them get off the bus I got right in his face and looked at him I said you're not supposed to do that this man was old enough to be my daddy he probably a deacon more age than I was I'm talking about it he's been probably over 23 years as a deacon and I look right this place that's his brother you're not supposed to do that you know what he said he said the Bible says look on my heritage I said but it don't say lust after his heritage I didn't become a this side of the other actor coming into message I've always had those lines in thoughts I'm a human being and I'm well in those lines but I've always known that was God and I just wanted to know about him that's all I do today I won't know about it I want my family to have an opportunity to know about a God that's real I'm with this church to have an opportunity to be able to know about a real God not just the thoughts of your mind and some the 'saturday other way to be a Christian let Christ come and live in your heart then you don't have to worry about eternal life see we want all of those quotes I always was eternal my brother Dale always was eternal but why you livin like the devil may I say it in a plain old Baptist way a good old devil don't laugh like that you don't like that we do you we had things in the Baptist Church that I didn't have to be converted over and I come in this message you know one because we're trying to live for God you don't remember that some of you Pentecostals that you didn't have to be told about your hiring your clothes and you you paint your faces on the time you'd already heard those things you may not have done it but you already heard it where you come from what about it names are written in the book of life for the foundation of the world well he started saying to get us under guard shouting over door before the foundation of the world Edison 1:26 and 27 man come into being before the foundation of the world it is not just something that original God back there it's a reality of how grill a real God's relieved to know that shaker go ahead by less time less assurance 176 and spiral-wound less Jesus is mine Oh things Oh [Music] you
