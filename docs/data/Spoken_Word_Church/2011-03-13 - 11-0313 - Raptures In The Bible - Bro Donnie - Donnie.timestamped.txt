[1:08] them your faith and be with Brother Gary
[1:10] and brother Danny and the sister back is

[1:15] and this lesser fellowship with one
[1:17] another and been with the Lord with
[1:20] joyous thoughts on their heart is only
[1:22] the word you can bring and we ask you to
[1:24] be with brother Wade and yeah I had
[1:26] sister June and brother Josh is I don't
[1:29] know if they've made it back or not yet
[1:30] Lord but we've called for them to come
[1:32] back home safely and I believe they'll
[1:33] be here and I just ask you bless this
[1:36] little church here today Father God if
[1:37] you send that in the Holy Spirit to be
[1:39] with us Lord and bless your word as it
[1:41] comes forward
[1:42] there ain't no other place to be
[1:44] today for me on the face of this Earth
[1:46] and right here to hear your precious
[1:49] word
[1:50] and she told me to come here
[1:52] and Lord
[1:54] nothing in this life of mine has ever
[1:56] been anything more to me than this word
[1:59] that you brought me from this little
[2:01] wooden building here
[2:03] my precious brother and I asked Lord
[2:05] that you just bless us here today and
[2:07] bless our fellowship yes don't let us
[2:09] say anything or do anything to harm or
[2:11] hinder anybody you just come home to say
[2:13] now bless your word
[2:15] and we ask these things in heavy way
[2:17] with us father God just take all the
[2:19] weight with us
[2:20] let these vessels be yours that you
[2:22] created father God you disclaim them and
[2:25] I asked in Your Name Lord Jesus Christ
[2:27] amen
[2:29] oh
[2:30] amen
[2:32] uh I had a little thought last night I
[2:35] was cranking about several things and
[2:37] all the things that brother Dale's been
[2:39] preaching on and the wonderful things
[2:42] that brother Wade has been doing here in
[2:43] Sunday school this morning in the
[2:45] mornings about the Brazil's and all and
[2:47] he's taking it so slow and I love that
[2:51] and uh I'm enjoying it it's been the
[2:54] heights of my visitation here at this
[2:57] church in Lewis is what's coming for
[2:59] this day
[3:01] you can see the progression of the word
[3:03] is the same word but the Revelation is
[3:06] greater it's got to be greater Brother
[3:08] Ray because what we got here is not
[3:09] getting it done and so it's just coming
[3:12] more and more before I forget it's on my
[3:15] mind we're going to talk about the six
[3:17] stages or the six raptures in the Bible
[3:19] this morning a little bit I'm not going
[3:22] to keep you alone
[3:24] and uh
[3:26] I I just hope that
[3:29] we all can open up and I would say to
[3:32] all of you here I I've been doing
[3:35] something lately and it's really helping
[3:37] me a lot is to take brother Dale seals
[3:39] the increase in 83 and I've been going
[3:41] over and listening to them and I've
[3:43] tried to listen to him a couple times
[3:45] before and I'm telling you I just really
[3:47] didn't understand them and uh
[3:50] of course what listens brother around
[3:53] sales and and you've got to have a good
[3:56] foundation before you can really
[3:57] understand and then you go back to
[3:59] brother Dale's and listen to what he's
[4:01] brought it's just so simple uh and each
[4:04] of those seals and I would I would say
[4:07] to all of you that if you'll just take
[4:09] the time
[4:10] sit down and just listened to his seals
[4:13] that he preached in 83 will help us a
[4:15] lot brother Wade comes out and gets into
[4:18] the first seal second seat on third seal
[4:21] you'll have a lot better understanding
[4:22] and you'll be more prepared because
[4:24] scripture says we got to study and show
[4:26] ourselves to prove so I mean we can
[4:29] stand here and chat we'll message all
[4:31] day long to take one lady become message
[4:33] people that I know of and that's to get
[4:35] into this right here
[4:37] the little book we gotta eat it right
[4:39] and that's all we can do so let's start
[4:43] with uh the six Raptors
[4:46] that they're talking it's in the Bible
[4:48] this is uh this is actually an article
[4:50] from the message Chronicle that I picked
[4:53] it up last night now I had a thought God
[4:56] woke me up the other morning and give me
[4:58] a little thought uh actually I was doing
[5:01] what my pastor had told me to do said
[5:03] you get woke up in the middle nicely
[5:05] just pray for me that will put you back
[5:07] sleep every time well it's got to worry
[5:09] don't do that you know
[5:11] and that's a good thing because I get to
[5:13] pray for everybody here when that
[5:14] happens I don't I try not to leave a
[5:16] name out and if I do uh forgive me I get
[5:19] it the next time so uh I believe that's
[5:23] what we got to do as brothers and
[5:24] sisters in here because there's a couple
[5:27] of things that's helping the church also
[5:28] to me the way I see it and part of it is
[5:31] our little things that we have our
[5:33] denominations that we have with each
[5:35] other that we shouldn't have
[5:37] we should just totally love each other
[5:39] and be kind of one another and
[5:43] um
[5:44] you know for us to get to that stage we
[5:48] have to be at that stage so the seals
[5:50] can come on and do their job for this
[5:52] place and then we'll be out of here but
[5:55] anyway
[5:56] uh I believe that we also first of all
[6:01] love one another and be kind of one
[6:02] another and that's that's
[6:05] my heart to all of you here this morning
[6:07] because I look at faces I hear that
[6:09] woman looking at me and one of you that
[6:11] I don't love
[6:12] and I can also say it and I don't know
[6:15] you but I know I love you
[6:18] who you are where you come bro but uh
[6:22] anyway let's let me get on into this
[6:25] because I don't want to go that
[6:26] direction I want to get into these these
[6:29] raptures I found it an interesting
[6:31] article so I said well maybe I'll talk
[6:34] about it a little bit and of course I
[6:35] got to the
[6:36] filth Rapture and I got to put my little
[6:39] message back in here that the Lord woke
[6:41] me up the other morning and give me and
[6:43] I sat there and I you know sometimes you
[6:45] know you're sitting there talking and
[6:46] you and the Lord's talking to me he's
[6:49] he'll uh I'll be praying for him one of
[6:52] y'all to hear in the church and all of a
[6:54] sudden I would start going off and I'll
[6:56] start he'll start giving me stuff to
[6:58] talk
[6:58] or this the sermon I guess is I don't
[7:01] know it's not a sermon it just tells me
[7:03] what he wants me to say a lot of times
[7:05] and I'll sit there and I'll I'll think
[7:07] about it and I'll start saying it and
[7:09] then all of a sudden I look up 45
[7:11] minutes on the clock is gone and I think
[7:13] I'm awake but I know it must be dreaming
[7:15] it or something because it just keeps
[7:16] coming I said well where's my pen and
[7:19] beats paper I need to write that down or
[7:20] I need a uh you know a recorder to catch
[7:24] all that because it's so wonderful how
[7:27] he just comes in and this sews it right
[7:29] up ties it right up and then I try to
[7:31] get up and repeat it and I mess it all
[7:33] up
[7:34] but anyway
[7:35] it's a wonderful thing when that happens
[7:38] and I believe the Lord is here
[7:40] um
[7:41] we had a good time yesterday over there
[7:43] at the uh
[7:44] assisted living home and uh
[7:48] heard some good singing right uh piano
[7:50] was a little bit often when she was in a
[7:54] flat uh finally a brother on the guitar
[7:57] with me he said Donald got to go on down
[7:59] the sea she's she's about that far off
[8:01] with it I'm watching my hands and that
[8:03] was about true so you know but like
[8:05] brother Joe always says Lord will
[8:07] provide and he did we had a wonderful
[8:09] time
[8:10] uh but anyway let me get on into this
[8:12] because I'll be talking all day long
[8:15] about getting to what I'm supposed to be
[8:16] getting to uh first of all I want to go
[8:19] to any Bibles
[8:20] uh go to Genesis
[8:23] 524.
[8:26] in the first Rapture that we know of
[8:29] there is Enoch and we're just going to
[8:32] leave a little scripture there for a few
[8:33] minutes then I'm gonna move on to the
[8:34] other one each one I was gonna pull up
[8:37] some stuff on brother brown but my
[8:39] computer has been down at the house and
[8:41] it's had a lot of little issues and
[8:44] brother Josh has been trying to help me
[8:45] out with it uh but I was not able to
[8:48] pull up any of his quotes So this this
[8:51] one I'm bringing is
[8:53] is
[8:54] from Brother Bama so we're all good with
[8:57] that right because I like to
[9:00] we have an edge of profit coming and
[9:02] told us these things or else we wouldn't
[9:03] understand them
[9:05] so anyway let's go to Genesis 5 24.
[9:09] and let's see
[9:13] I brought my big Letter Bible so I could
[9:15] see a little bit this morning
[9:17] anyway and he got walked with God and he
[9:21] was not for God took him
[9:24] now
[9:26] we know that what happened right there
[9:28] it was someone with God that he just
[9:31] took him out of here
[9:34] and I want to go to the next one which
[9:36] was Elijah
[9:37] number two second Kings 2 11.
[9:44] Enoch the pyramid Builder
[10:03] okay
[10:05] to the marketing a little help me out a
[10:07] little bit
[10:09] uh okay
[10:11] Second Kings 2 11.
[10:16] and it came to pass as they still went
[10:19] on and talked
[10:20] that behold their period of Chariot of
[10:23] fire and Horses of fire and parted them
[10:26] both asunder and Elijah went up the
[10:28] world went into heaven
[10:30] and Elijah saw it and he cried my father
[10:33] my father the chair of Israel and the
[10:36] horsemen thereof and he saw him no more
[10:42] and he took up
[10:44] or he took hold of his own clothes and
[10:47] rent them in two pieces and he took up
[10:50] also the mandal of Elijah that fell from
[10:52] him and he went back and stood by the
[10:55] bank of Jordan and he took the mantle of
[10:57] Elijah that he fell from him and smoked
[11:01] the waters and said where is the Lord
[11:03] God of Elijah and when he had smitten
[11:06] the waters they parted hither and
[11:08] thither and Elijah went over amen we
[11:11] know what that means
[11:14] that was a carrying away that's what the
[11:17] Rapture is is the carrying away of a
[11:19] person to another place or sphere of
[11:21] existence
[11:23] uh the arcade part definition of it is
[11:26] the act of carrying off
[11:29] uh the Third
[11:31] Elijah or the third Rapture I'm sorry uh
[11:35] Matthew 27 50 53
[11:40] .
[12:01] this is the Old Testament Saints Matthew
[12:03] 27
[12:06] 50 53 I believe is what I'm going to
[12:10] read
[12:11] everybody ready
[12:13] Jesus when he had cried again with a
[12:15] loud voice yielded up The Ghost and
[12:18] behold the veil of the temple was
[12:20] written and planned from the top to the
[12:23] bottom and the Earth did quake and the
[12:26] Rocks ran and the Grays were open and
[12:29] many bodies of the Saints would slap a
[12:32] rose
[12:33] and came out of the Braves after the
[12:37] resurrection and went into the holy city
[12:40] and appeared unto many
[12:43] now last night I was reading that and I
[12:47] didn't know that
[12:48] when the when when he he cried out the
[12:52] earthquake and they're about to Veil
[12:54] being around that's theirs but I never
[12:57] called it that those Graves were cracked
[13:00] and those Saints came out at that time
[13:05] that's right and I I didn't I sat now
[13:08] look at that I said that's that's
[13:10] special right there that's wonderful
[13:11] because
[13:13] that's gonna happen with us
[13:15] that's good it's already been it's
[13:17] already been written so it's going to
[13:19] happen
[13:19] the next one the fourth rapture
[13:25] was Jesus Christ in the book of Acts one
[13:41] man
[13:43] through 11. foreign
[13:50] nine and eleven
[13:53] and when he had spoken these things
[13:55] while they beheld he was taken up
[13:58] and a cloud received him out of their
[14:01] sight
[14:02] and while they looked
[14:04] steadfastly toward heaven
[14:06] as he went up to hold two men stood by
[14:10] by them in white apparel
[14:13] which also said he men of Galilee why
[14:17] stand ye gazing up into heaven this same
[14:20] Jesus which is taken up from you into
[14:22] heaven shall so come in like manner as
[14:27] ye have seen him go into heaven
[14:31] now I don't know about y'all but I I see
[14:35] myself there doing that I know there's
[14:37] many times that my daddy come to me
[14:39] about a lot of things
[14:41] and that's what we're talking about here
[14:43] headship
[14:45] having correct headship I remember a lot
[14:48] of times my daddy telling me a lot of
[14:49] things to go do things
[14:52] and and me not do it and I can see me
[14:55] and my brother Tommy
[14:59] standing there
[15:00] gazing off somewhere not doing what was
[15:03] told
[15:05] and him coming up
[15:06] side the head say go do what I told you
[15:09] just simply go do what I tell you that's
[15:11] what God does with us and sometimes you
[15:14] know I I can testify to myself that uh
[15:19] I am hard-headed and the Lord has got my
[15:22] attention many times and he has a way
[15:25] about you know jerking your chain a
[15:27] little bit it's uh it hasn't always
[15:32] I think
[15:33] that I know a lot of times that he don't
[15:36] just up and say now you need to go on up
[15:39] and do what I told you to he's not going
[15:41] to do that
[15:42] he's going to scream it go do it what I
[15:44] told you to
[15:46] and that's what he's telling us today
[15:49] come give the word
[15:51] supposed to do whatever it is in
[15:55] this church
[15:57] because you never know when you're not
[15:59] here
[16:00] it's a battle getting here every day
[16:03] live what the Lord tells you to do is
[16:06] simple
[16:07] but it's a hard battle because
[16:12] so many times in the mornings now this
[16:15] morning I knew I was going to have to be
[16:16] here and I would have beat the doors
[16:18] down at six o'clock this morning and I'm
[16:20] not an early Rising folks
[16:22] but when I know that I've got to be here
[16:24] you know I've been asked to be here I'm
[16:26] going to be here did my partner
[16:29] and uh
[16:30] hope I don't bore you with none of this
[16:32] I've seen this and I thought to myself I
[16:35] said what a what a wonderful thing just
[16:37] to talk about in the Sunday school class
[16:38] is a rapture
[16:41] um
[16:42] and
[16:43] doing what we're told by his word
[16:47] that's Grace because you can understand
[16:50] Christ I was talking to God the other
[16:52] day about talking to a real hard
[16:54] trinitarian at Theologian this guy's a
[16:58] theologian he's Theologian to the Core
[17:01] and I asked him to explain to me why
[17:06] they had two baptisms in the Bible
[17:08] the difference between being so smart I
[17:11] said you you explained it to me
[17:14] why did Jesus say do it this way here
[17:16] and wanted after the baptism of the Holy
[17:19] Ghost came and the word is done put in
[17:21] had been put in these people for three
[17:23] and a half years why
[17:26] did they come out and say it this way
[17:29] and they also underlined it to me in big
[17:33] letters
[17:34] standing out flashing lights if you
[17:36] don't do it this way you can't get there
[17:39] and they just looked at me he says
[17:42] well this teaches me this way and I'm
[17:44] going to stay there I said okay
[17:47] You've Been Told
[17:49] and that's a good thing when you tell
[17:50] people
[17:51] and they tell you that because you know
[17:53] one day you're gonna see him again
[17:55] and that's being disobedient
[17:57] they're sitting there and taking
[17:58] whatever they throw out there to you
[18:02] I would want to know if something is
[18:04] different in this Bible
[18:06] I I mean you got to know we got to know
[18:10] and like I said thank God he sent us a
[18:12] profit but give us these answers to
[18:15] these things
[18:16] because I pretty much folks I'll tell
[18:17] y'all something I pretty much in my
[18:19] heart I've given up I'm a Baptist in the
[18:21] Methodist
[18:22] at least could look at a Jew and say
[18:24] they believe in one God
[18:27] that's all there is
[18:29] there's other mythical Gods out there in
[18:31] comic books and things but there's only
[18:33] one God it's greater didn't know much
[18:36] didn't know hardly anything about this
[18:38] guy called Jesus Christ but I did
[18:40] understand one God that part of it which
[18:44] was only a part it wasn't all of it by
[18:47] far anyway
[18:49] that's the fourth Rapture the fifth
[18:53] Rapture
[18:55] um I want to start out right here and I
[18:58] wanted to build a little reading on this
[19:00] uh
[19:02] we'll go back actually to the fourth
[19:04] rapture
[19:06] uh
[19:08] I'm gonna go ahead and go to this one
[19:09] I'm gonna read some of this right here
[19:11] uh just for a minute the filth Rapture
[19:14] is that which is spoken of in
[19:17] Thessalonians 1 4 16 and First
[19:19] Corinthians 15 51.
[19:21] and concerns the catching away of a true
[19:26] bride-believing Christians who had
[19:29] received the message
[19:31] that God sent to them for the day
[19:35] of Pentecost through the contents of the
[19:38] seven Church ages of Hill today now
[19:41] that's the body of Believers is composed
[19:43] of the Saints who have died during the
[19:46] Ephesians Smyrna Improvement dietary
[19:51] Philadelphian and The Layover seeing
[19:53] Church ages with the living saints that
[19:56] are still alive in our age
[19:59] all these Saints
[20:01] are bound to meet the Lord
[20:04] I've had my strength a little bit to
[20:06] read this because the writing is so
[20:07] small uh because of the Rapture time
[20:12] these are the dead in Christ which shall
[20:15] first come then which are alive and
[20:18] remain shall be called up together with
[20:20] them in the clouds made him in the air
[20:22] now how do we get there in this field
[20:26] in this filth Rapture which is the Bride
[20:28] of Jesus Christ first of all we already
[20:32] know just like it just said there was a
[20:34] group come through these churches all of
[20:35] them come through the seventh churches
[20:37] all of us did and
[20:40] I want to go back to Malachi 4
[20:45] . and I'm just going to touch on this
[20:47] minute and move on to the scriptures
[20:49] that uh that's going to bring us
[20:52] the tractor
[21:06] Malachi 4 5. behold I will send you
[21:11] you talk to me Elijah the prophet before
[21:13] the coming of the great and Dreadful day
[21:15] of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts
[21:17] of the fathers to the children and the
[21:20] hearts of the children to their fathers
[21:22] lest I come and smite the Earth with a
[21:25] curse
[21:26] we all know that that's a promise the
[21:29] Old Testament in the New Testament that
[21:32] he's going to do that so that's got to
[21:34] be done now
[21:37] we all know the part that's John the
[21:40] Baptist and where the Prophet fits in
[21:42] the Revelation 10 7 guy you know who he
[21:44] is okay
[21:46] now
[21:48] I want to live up to
[21:50] Revelations 10 7 will this hopeless
[21:52] thought there just for a second
[21:57] all of you read it with me because
[22:00] these are
[22:08] very important
[22:11] but in the days of the voice the seven
[22:13] angels when he shall begin the sound
[22:17] the mystery of God one mystery shall be
[22:20] finished as he hath declared to his
[22:22] servants the prophets
[22:27] now
[22:29] we know that was brother Brown
[22:31] the Lord working in brother Brown of us
[22:34] fourth Covenant of Elijah I don't know
[22:36] that right okay now the promise was made
[22:40] there in Malachi
[22:43] Revelations 10 7 has happened it's
[22:45] already happened now we get to the other
[22:48] part Luke 17 30.
[22:51] sure you all know it
[22:53] but I still love reading it
[22:56] let's live Luke 17 31 kind of gets your
[23:00] attention
[23:03] but Luke 17 30.
[23:10] actually let's go to Luke 17 29.
[23:14] but the same day that light went out of
[23:17] Sodom it rained
[23:20] and brimstone from heaven and destroyed
[23:22] them all even thus shall it be in the
[23:25] days when the son of man is revealed
[23:32] now you can look today if you can't see
[23:35] what's out there
[23:38] I really ain't against those people out
[23:40] there they just don't know any better
[23:41] you know they really don't
[23:43] uh
[23:44] some I it's it's always sat in my heart
[23:47] that just this message is not for
[23:49] everybody it's only for a small catching
[23:52] away with people
[23:54] and
[23:57] it's a sad thing to see
[23:59] that's why we all must be kind
[24:02] of uh and you know to these people
[24:04] because
[24:05] they're not called
[24:08] I mean you can go through Walmart you
[24:10] can sit there and watch them come in our
[24:11] store every day and I sit there and talk
[24:12] to them and I'll say Lord bless them
[24:14] when they walk out the door
[24:16] because they're keeping us going
[24:21] and for whatever reason this is like
[24:24] this I mean he knew that Del wouldn't
[24:25] accept it but it is a very small catch
[24:29] in the way and we're very select left
[24:32] group of people and it really kind of
[24:35] hurts my heart when I sometimes
[24:39] uh get frustrated with the cares of life
[24:42] or being at the shop see things that
[24:44] happen and you see them little Spirits
[24:46] start jumping like little monkeys
[24:47] between trees and one of them lands on
[24:49] your shoulder and you don't brush your
[24:50] mouth right quick
[24:52] feel like you do things
[24:54] and then something will stop you and say
[24:56] hey
[24:57] you get rid of that go right on in there
[25:00] and come back and apologize and that's
[25:02] happened it does happen to me and I'm
[25:05] sitting there and I'm so ashamed one day
[25:07] I walked out there and I said something
[25:09] I shouldn't have said and I knew it I
[25:12] knew it was wrong this wasn't something
[25:14] devil been beating on me about two weeks
[25:16] about and I said why are you being on me
[25:18] I shouldn't be letting this happen
[25:21] I'm a Child of God he's already been
[25:23] whooped I don't know what my problem is
[25:25] my problem is a lack of faith it's a
[25:27] lack of word
[25:29] I got to get rid of this this ain't
[25:32] right it don't fit the shoes too tight
[25:34] blisters on my feet and it's hurting
[25:37] Okay so
[25:40] I mean it happened that quick
[25:42] and it almost as an employee of mine
[25:44] standing there when I did it
[25:46] and as soon as it happened I said
[25:48] something I shouldn't have said
[25:50] and the next thing that happened he was
[25:52] looking at me straight in the eye and he
[25:53] was one of them little doubting demons
[25:56] but he saw something I know he did
[25:58] because I started crying I just my tears
[26:01] started running down my eyes I said I'm
[26:02] so ashamed you forgive me
[26:05] you forgive me for what I just said that
[26:08] was wrong
[26:09] now I'm going to go ask the Lord to
[26:11] forgive me
[26:12] and he told me he said you don't have to
[26:14] ask me I said yes I do
[26:17] that's where your mom and I do have to
[26:19] ask people
[26:20] and I went in and of course I asked the
[26:22] Lord to forgive me
[26:24] and it burned me a while
[26:25] a good while
[26:27] until these things that we have to grow
[26:29] and we have to know not to do these
[26:31] things because we're a special group of
[26:33] people
[26:35] by his grace I mean I know that I was
[26:38] born in sin I know who I am I look this
[26:40] man in the mirror I ain't no goodie two
[26:43] shoes folks
[26:45] but it's his word that says I am amen
[26:48] now I'd rather hold on to God's word
[26:50] than I had to hold on to this vanity
[26:53] thing
[26:54] because God's word
[26:57] I mean if I had a choice of standing on
[26:59] Heaven standing on Earth or standing on
[27:01] God's word for eternity y'all know what
[27:03] I'm gonna stand on that word
[27:05] his word he knows that's the only thing
[27:09] that's going to hold up that's right so
[27:12] I'll take his word he said it about me
[27:15] right and so I'm gonna believe what he
[27:18] said because I know who I am
[27:21] I'm a failure you're waiting to happen
[27:23] every day I wake up that's right
[27:25] so you know we all must just be proud of
[27:29] who we are and the word we've heard if
[27:31] you didn't hear another word today what
[27:33] would you do
[27:37] what would you do
[27:39] what if I come in here and shut this
[27:40] church down that brother down another
[27:42] way and all the other people here and
[27:44] Scattered us around what would you do
[27:47] have you remembered enough
[27:50] no Dolly from California
[27:55] amen that's right
[27:58] I was talking to a brother Mark I mean
[28:00] you stop thinking ain't no accident
[28:02] folks he's seen this before the
[28:03] foundation of the world what he was
[28:05] going to have to do to get us here all
[28:08] of us here this day
[28:12] we're a special group of people amen
[28:15] if God made for you who can be against
[28:18] you
[28:20] that's the that's the way you've got to
[28:22] be
[28:23] okay
[28:24] otherwise we're still going to be going
[28:26] to church
[28:28] I'm from getting out of here
[28:30] and I know I'll tell you all right now I
[28:33] know I'm not ready
[28:35] but I ask Lord whatever it takes
[28:38] you have to drag me down the street to
[28:40] get me ready hook me up right today
[28:43] because nothing else matters
[28:46] okay
[28:48] win the fifth now but Luke 17 30 and
[28:52] this is two scriptures that just make my
[28:54] day
[28:55] I love them I really do
[28:58] is it time
[29:00] let me finish this okay uh first
[29:04] Thessalonians 4 16.
[29:07] so you won't do that
[29:09] on the stable description that I got and
[29:12] finish this y'all forgive me
[29:21] first Thessalonians 4.
[29:26] uh 416. there ain't no point
[29:33] that's right
[29:35] well we'll start at 15.
[29:38] let's go to 14. and then I'm gonna I'm
[29:42] gonna hit this right quick
[29:43] for if we believe that Jesus died rose
[29:46] again do we amen amen here amen even so
[29:50] them also which sleep in Jesus will God
[29:54] bring with him
[29:55] for this we say unto you by word of the
[29:59] Lord that we which are alive and remain
[30:01] unto the coming of the Lord shall not
[30:04] prevent them which are asleep for the
[30:06] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[30:09] with a shout
[30:10] or the voice of an archangel and the
[30:13] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[30:15] shall rise first then we meet which are
[30:19] alive and remain shall be caught up
[30:21] together with them in the clouds to meet
[30:24] the Lord in the air and some shall we
[30:27] ever be with the Lord
[30:30] now that's the filtering that's his
[30:33] promise his word that's my scripture
[30:35] don't ever ask what my scripture that's
[30:38] my scripture I believe that
[30:39] with all my heart he showed me that that
[30:42] brought a circle now the sixth Rapture
[30:46] is the two witnesses which are Moses and
[30:48] Elijah we're not going to have time to
[30:50] read it because that clock set ahead
[30:53] is
[30:57] the two witnesses and there'll be three
[31:00] signs that come
[31:02] in the fifth Rapture first of all it'll
[31:06] be the Lord himself shall shout is one
[31:08] well the voice is two and the the horse
[31:12] on the Archangel and the third is the
[31:15] Trump
[31:16] that he will be
[31:18] so I hope that we've learned something
[31:21] this morning about the raptures there's
[31:24] six of them
[31:25] and we all got a meeting dope
[31:29] uh we're gonna continue the people in
