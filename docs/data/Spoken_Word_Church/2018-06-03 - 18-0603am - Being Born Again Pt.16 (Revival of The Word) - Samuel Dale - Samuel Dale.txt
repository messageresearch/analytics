to see good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn what we've been reading in first Peter and we'll just read back up a little bit and use that in our thought today where we've been using first Peter for a long time but we'll just start with verse 13 you know remember now that the Lord willing after the evening service we'll be having a birthday party for sister Dale after the evening service we could do with the communion foot-washing tonight and be cake and ice cream so everybody's staying have a good time celebrating her 35th birthday she's just 35 today so that's huh it'd be hard to figure out how that we've been married 60 years but that's for you to figure it out okay so remember that there's praise the Lord would bless her she's having a lot of troubles going through all of these tests and things but praise the Lord would bring it all out and make everything work out to his remember brother Lewis name be traveling back there leaving out some time come and come back home and everything so practice Lord we bless them brother Joe and him should be already where their destination may be today or whatever so Bret the Lord would would have give them a good time and all I can okay first Peter anything else I generally missed something first Peter 1:13 father we thank you for your love and your grace father thank you that you have opened their eyes unto your word and we ask you to just guide us and let your light shine father into our our pathway that it would lighten up to where we can see how to walk because we must walk in you have your way forgive our sins bless God each one and or just bless these that are traveling different things and just have your way with everybody and let Lord your word come forth to manifest itself in this state because it's a promise and we believe you well that we thank you forgive our sins and guide us in Jesus name Amen we'll start with verse 13 through 23 we've been using like 22 and 23 alright wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you when at the revelation of Jesus Christ now that is this day this time 45 Christ's mystery of God revealed at the revealing of the word alright as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance but as he which hath called us has called you is holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation because it is written be holy for I am holy if you call on the father who without respect of persons judges according to every man's work pass the time of your sojourning here in the theater for as much as you know that you have not you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your father's but with the precious blood of Jesus Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot Hoover Li was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifested in these last times for you who by him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your faith in your hope might be in God seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not a corruptible seed but of the of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth forever you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word I want to try to background some in all but you they've got your notes you notice you got the same notes that you had Sunday I mean Wednesday to where that you can just follow along in the reading but I want to us to think on something that I tried to express dark in the message first off do we believe the promises of God are yes amen that was our thought all right see if God promised something then it's not up to us to try to make that manifest it's up to him to make it manifest we just follow along go right along with it no but it's up to him if he said it so all we got to do is to find out if God said it all right then if he said it then we believe that he promised to do it it's always been the same down through there like the Bible says when the day of Pentecost was fully come what it promised it all right when it fully come then the Holy Ghost fail he promised it see then that's that's what we should be thinking about all right now to to see that and to find the day in that hour that we're living and the promise is for this time to where we're at to where we can follow in that line okay now we covered and have been covering for quite a while about the new birth and we had some lifes not on the points of the new birth the baptism of the holy ghost in the Bible study and I really enjoyed it if you want to get the tape and they can make you a copy and listen to it alright because we've been talking about for quite a while about the new birth being the birth of the word how does the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you all right now it's not as we were covering last night see the baptism of the Holy Ghost even though it fell on a hundred and twenty in the upper room it was not collective forever how you called it as a group it was to each individual in the upper room each individual was receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth the birth of the word that they had held for the three and a half years or whatever and each one was receiving it and it's not in a collective form God doesn't deal with us that away he deals with the Jews more into the line of a group of people are a nation or something but he deals with us Gentiles as individuals all right so then that way it wouldn't matter as I expressed it last night you had them accenting in the upper room 120 you have 80 70 80 here today sitting and the Holy Ghost could fall on each person here today and quicken some part of the word to each individual right right this here sitting here I mean he could do that all at one time it wouldn't be collective it would still be an individual afire all right so then when that day of Pentecost was fully come the Holy Ghost failed what because it was time but it fell on individuals to bring forth that new birth all right now thence we do we know that we talked about it I'm referring back to this past Wednesday that we talked about the the new birth what is it it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost we see always this is that it's that what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the revealing of God's Word it is the Spirit of God coming to you that have took the word and believed it and making that word alive so there's your baptism see we're looking for something to come out of the sky something to come out of this or some somewhere instead of looking at it as what it is and then realizing that the Holy Ghost is was saying was in each individual person in the upper room Mariah but it was the promise of the Holy Spirit being poured out upon mankind but it was revealing of God's Word and when the word it's made a lot they'll automatically be signs and wonders and and manifestations and and and you know feelings and and all kinds of things we'll go with that when it's the word being quickened unto you but we should look to the word being quickened first you know and then we go to the basis of whatever took place just like get the baby here right and many times get the baby here it's the birth all right then the baby cries see it does this that's the way we should be in Christ is let that word be made alive within us and then there'll be great manifestations father alright let's see I'll say this and then I'll get back to it in the message part I believe and they've talked is from the way back in the beginning I believe we're in the greatest revival that has ever been to the world right now well I just don't see it I'm going on see you say I still see them going on you're looking for something going on you're not looking the way I'm looking I've always looked at the revealing of God's Word what else could it be here stands a prophet here stands a prophet bring in the word and he said I've seen sick healed dead raised all kind of signs and wonders right well what did he say about the opening of the word of the seals he said this is the greatest realm that I've ever worked him well others don't that's way that that what was the woman preacher back there said at that time I some of you told me as he said it or sister so and so I won't go in the ninth but said under well I thought you know i I've never seen anything greater then what wrote around except in my own ministry you know because that's the way everybody thing see they wouldn't look in there was the Prophet bringing the Word of God from Almighty God himself the voice of God speaking to mankind but people were thinking ain't no revival I went down there and he was dead a doornail we're over here where we can shout and glory I have a good time in a revival just remember you're supposed to return this or believed it all the way down or revival is not for sinners or revile you can't revive a sinner revival is for those that are already in Christ alright so don't forget to thought now of what I'm trying to bring okay but see to me the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth and all it's one in the same because it's the word that's made alive and that's the thing that that has always held me to the basis of what I believe and worth it I believe it I believe the word has to be planted then the Spirit of God comes to make that word alive and what greater could it be then you have your signs and wonders and your manifestations and your things but get to the word first get to the word first because if you get to the word it'll bring these other things alright now as we've come up in our time and our thoughts of where we got up to the point that we're trying to deal with these virtues and talk about that a little bit of the stature of a perfect man and and the growth development in the things all right and as we've come to that place we know the Prophet said have faith and be born again alright and these things these virtues are the things that God expects us to bring forth or to make manifest he's the one that's going to bring a forth in G to you and I we can't do it anyway but you understand what I'm getting at alright we see we spoke about the virtues are to be added to the new birth but remember now faith I'm backing up over a lot of messages but trying to put it together and hold it Faith's the new birth is not an ad it's a birth excuse me it's the birth of the word alright faith revelation is a birth of the word alright I had this old coffin and it keeps hanging on and I'll keep giving it to the devil and he gives it back to the men and we have a fight over but that's all right all right but now what has been I thought got one in my mouth what has been our thoughts now have faith the Prophet said you supposed to have read the statue of perfect man and seen how many times he spoke of faith and what faith was and faith was the foundation of all Christianity because faith is the revealed Word of God the new birth is faith all right now then you add virtue to faith it doesn't say add faith it says you know in other words putting a prophet there how faith and be born again and then add because you can't add something that there's not something there for it to be added to so the birth is the birth of the word all right now see then you're standing there looking at it as the born-again experience of the same born-again experience that everybody has had everybody has the same new birth I mean these things when I start talking people just look at me everybody's had the same new birth what would be the problem with that no they shouted and we cried they think you're you're still on your manifestations you're still on your doing and then when I say baptism with the Holy Spirit you're looking for something from up in heaven to come down some kind of a manifestations as I remember that's after the birth if we get that settled then we can go on through the message and talk about these virtues in time all right now we come as I said to the point that we're talking about we must have these virtues we'll get to it at the end of the message the Lord with it that brother Adam covers it that there'll be no rapture without these virtues you say well why the rapture sovan not really no come on Anna we thought it'd be a long time ago it's our problem he says these the person with these virtues is the one that's going into rapture well I see then I'm serious in the point that I've always been serious that looking at those things and studying the word from 50 years ago coming and still thinking the same today how do we get those virtues if we must have them and to the people that are going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye that group of people is going to be though standing there with the virtues now they may go by the grave for other things or not but I'm talking about the change when I talk about rapture all right see that what's the point of the rapture the virtues the thing all of it tie together in the simple thoughts of a prophet brain about the new birth come on that's that's the point you were to think on he made it simple we get to new birth then we get a growth development in the word to the position the word that we can be qualified for a change of these bodies you say well what see that's the point what has it been so long because of the bride now what did we talk about the bride what did we talk about her this past Wednesday we went in the scriptures there in in Ephesians they would one awake thou that sleepest and we talked about where the prophet said that it was the bride asleep in them denomination's know what about it the bride being a I'm not asleep I'm wide awake I'm in this message well that was back yonder now when we was in them denominations and then we come out of them denominations and now we're in the bride age you're only in the bride age if you're birthed into them you're gonna get down to that one one of these days the Prophet says you birthed into this you birthed into this you virgins there there's a bride age you got to be birthed into it the bride's not in lady will see us know the bride's not she's birthed into the age of the opening of the word that's where the trouble has been if people are not believing what the word have said and watching it or for the hour and time that we're living you're trying to figure it out with something to put darter to make it work and it won't work it has to be God revealing it and making it manifest all right so then what do we talk about what's that in a minute when we get back to it under awakening of the bride the Bible says revelation 18:4 come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her plagues and things yeah we're just sleeping the home ceased it's getting worse and worse and Peter's just falling away it's just falling back and just getting less concerned you say well you don't pick on me well I ain't picking on you if there's anything the word is doing the picking I don't have them do that but now listen we must have these virtues the said to bring us to a place of rapture and faith all right now and to have these virtues there must be a way that we can receive them so that's what we covered Wednesday night we've covered it over over I preached this for 40-something years what how that we get these virtues is what if these virtues were in the early church and the Prophet said they were they had it in the least little nod huh but down to the dark ages and things the channel and ways of these things has went away until you kind of how the returning of the faith of the fathers and what is the returning of the faith our revelation of the father's to bring these virtues back into the church right that's the simple thing to me that that I've always looked at it's the faith of the fathers it's to see to come back to where they were and that's why I've always tried to get you to see it the Peter standing there saying I'm speaking to born-again believers today said and said now we've got to grow into these things and said to do that we've got to how these virtues and things all right and as he does he's trying to teach us how to get to where he was but that was lost to the dark ages and time until you bother to come out of it with a new birth right but then promised that it would be restored is Malaca for a promise you won't I send you Elijah the prophet and he that's a promise well just because it would be brought forth in brother Branham that doesn't mean that it's made manifest by you and me no there's a lot of difference in that a lot of difference in what he made manifesting what me and you running around with what you see then 327 church age book this messenger malachi for luke 1730 revelation 2:10 7 another word Allah is gonna do two things what 1 turn the hearts of the children back to the face of the Father that's what he come far alright but he didn't finish that now he tells us how that is to be done because and to to reveal the seven thunders which is a revelation contained in the seven seals and it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn us back all right now he's turning us telling us how that it can happen by those seven thunders well nobody don't know what those thunders are your prophet said it was the voice of God so I'm solved with that you can argue how you want to and this got to be this and it's got to be that anything you tell me that's got to be it's gonna come back to the revealing of the word come on I done been around too long so don't think that's I'm not serious about doing it I've already been through Island you say oh them say I'm done it that's the third book but a wren said a third pools opening of the word yeah but take this that that's up between you and God and what he wants to do about it I'm just answering the question the third bull is the opening of the word that's what your prophet said but do we believe that oh we believe that but we want this all this other stuff to put something to her we don't believe and stand on order all right let's believe one thing let's take what we can prove to be true and stand on it and believe it right see then my contention that's been all alone the new birth is a revealing on God's Word we'll see this that settles that that's what we're talking about it life not you know and you think about it brother Branham when he would say something he's telling you what the Word of God says I thought that's what we believe the Prophet was supposed to come and do was to tell us what the word says and the word is God all right as we were talking about Wednesday night then see where the Prophet said the Thunder is the voice of God when the seal breaks he's the one time and I gave it to you in C he said it thundered from my inside the throne he said now here stood the lamb all right what's he doing a channel for things to come forth the voice of God speaking from eternity to tell the lamb what to bring forth and what to write all right then wants to go next the thunders a voice of God all right the voice of God then would transfer from the lamb who would take the book and open the seals it would transfer from the lamb to the end time prophet right you still got the voice of God you still got the voice of God you got it coming down to understanding now when it comes to the Prophet then where does it go from there it goes to the fivefold ministry now that's what your Bible says and that's what your prophet said but you get it irony back up see you follow me okay God there's a voice and he stunner and then the Prophet the Lamb the Bligh's forth and all and then the Prophet gets it and you're doing good are you riding luck that's real good but then you say now sapphire phone industry is the voice of God I listen folks I don't mind being straight and playing always been will you never try to hide nothing always just been straight I don't argue with anybody about a lot of this called fivefold ministry people of this message I don't blame you for not wanting to hear oh but you know what if there's a false there is a true some work right if there's a false there's a true somewhere okay so the voice of God is still sounding now listen we didn't end that see that's where people take you I mean they'll stop on that line and else Ward I don't see about five whole minutes I'm saying they don't they don't go on with it to the basis of seeing that the life stage of that voice of God the Thunder is in the bride of Jesus Christ it comes to you and it's speaking to you personally to you and you're sounding that voice I thought the Prophet said the bride would be the final voice and my quoted him to the final age that's where people say Oh y'all are this one this is that the other you ain't never said talked to a oneness and got it right a oneness has just hold it to one manifestation of God or Jesus was the last one I differ with that totally little random wooden lifes manifestation of God either the bride of Jesus Christ is the lights manifestation that's what your prophet said but do we believe it so I'm trying to put it down to where your app getting you to see who you are and what's going on you realize because God spoke to the Prophet doesn't mean that he spoke to me and you he does that by way of the Prophet to speak but that's the voice of God if the Thunder is the voice of God and we read it over and over Wednesday night to you where the Prophet was giving them that that it's the voice of God when when the seal breaks and all the thing these seven thunders they say but we don't need this we don't Lee why don't we need it we need something you go out to admit one thing we've been around here a long time I think it's time to wake up and quit playing around with you sugar tits we've been around here a long time how much longer you think we got but that's one thing that I've always said and you watch it in what Abdullah could have always believed in a revival of the opening of the word and see then this message has never died in me from the day that I started in this message it's been opening and it's still opening way to the other day was here preaching like everything and I preached the seals three times I know and all at once I saw the second seal open it's like that well come to a proper opinion you know I don't know everything but I know a god it knows everything I'm still learning I'm still gaining ground if you ever get to the point do you think that you're not gaining ground you're in bad shape the Word of God is still unfolding itself and even after we leave this world and go into the eternity zhh the Prophet said there'll be a message of cheer down to the endless ages it would still be an unfolding of God or revealing of God even after we leave this world I've always said it this way we're just getting enough here to be able to understand that that's the best way I can say it all right but do you see what I'm talking about how do we get those virtues it's got to be by the seven thunders all right if the thunders is not sounded we can't get it I've blind okay is that straight enough we if the thunders ain't sounding you can't get it go we're going to read where the Prophet said it's the person with these virtues that's going to go in the rapture and then we can't how the virtues without having the thunders so we're gonna haul die and go by the grave and this whole thing is going to be a flop no somebody is going to believe it and stand up for it well why not let it be you and me we fought over all of these doctrines and ideas and opinions of people of the message when those demons come in and try to take away and pull this and pull that and we fold it out why can't we rejoice about what we see thanks don't say nothing what I said you're saying the words not opening you know whose fault it is yours it's your fault because you're not accepting what God is sending I don't make nothing out of me or any other fivefold ministry or whatever but it does make one thing for sure your prophets when it said it and your Bibles when it said it that the fivefold ministry was for the perfecting of the Saints now do you believe that he said fill me up with these virtues that I might teach others to bring these things to pi that's in the stacks of perfect man you're supposed to have read and listened to all right but listen that see then by Malecha for the message according to the prophet noon the thunders would sound to the Prophet he sounds it out to you and I and God makes it manifest as the revealed word right the opening of the word is the revealing of Jesus Christ to you and I all right because that way then you can hold good that that voice that you hear but you know what let me ask you a simple question or a thought why is it that you don't wife to all these doctrines and ideas that it went for the message when the people of the message is when I threw why didn't you go after it and some of you did and fluttered around and flattered around a little bit and played with it some but you've come back enough to understand that those things wouldn't right well that's what I got against you brother there because you just you just make it too plain you expose me one day when we're standing at the bar of judgment I want to ask you a question did you want to be exposed our be exposed here I want to get mine right here I don't care what it takes I don't care what it takes how much repentance it takes how much what I'm doing it takes I want it right here I don't want no trouble at the river right come on then what are we thinking about okay now watch what I'm getting at watch the point that I'm getting at the whole thing was the point of it Wednesday night the Prophet tells us the thunders the only way to get the virtues is for the thunders to sound forth mr. Masoner Malachi 4 luke 1730 revelation 10 say I'm going to do two things 1 turn the hearts of the children back to reveal this unders which is revelation contained in the seven seals in to be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn our arts by okay you can't argue with that ask your prophet a question than let him answer it brother Branham what is the new birth they've been so much confusion about the new bar what is a new birth cross the mystery of God revealed he said the new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you brother Branham what is the thunders he says the force of God when the seal bright brother branham what's going to bring rapture in faith you see this where I'm putting it all together and been doing it for quite a while have you been watching it see then if we don't want to know how to get these virtues it's got to be by the opening of the word of those seven thunders that's what's your prophet said all right now go to step two look what he says we read this Wednesday they can pull it up they want to number eight but that's alright which is 356 Lady of seeing church age now let me say this here I don't believe that God is calling only to the false vine to repent in this verse he is talking to the elect you've got it I read it they have something to something they have some repenting to do to many of his children are still in those false churches now he didn't a Methodist Baptist Presbyterian you know you could put Brandon Monson aren't you no or Lula eyes all round there of those of whom it speaks in Ephesians 5 and 14 awake now that sleepers in Iraq from the dead in Christ shall give thee life to be asleep is not to be dead these are the sleeping amongst the dead you know Paul you remember what he said over there that he wanted an out resurrection you know what Paul wanted an out resurrection come on that scripture he said they've been out he wanted an out resurrection out from among the dead an out resurrection from among the dead look to be asleep is not to be dead these are sleeping amongst the dead they're out there in the dead denominations they're floating along with their they are floating alone with them God cries out wake up repent of your folly hear their lending their influence even giving their time and their money actually their very lives to these Antichrist organization and all the wild thinking is alright they need to repent they must repent they need to have a change of mind and turn toward the truth what about it what's going to wake us up folks okay go to number seven while you're on there and we'll see paragraph 182 of the third seal now that's what to read what's the reason today that the revivals that were supposed to have listened oh they ain't no more revivals there ain't no more world wide sweeping revivals but the bride now listen to what he says hearings and read it in listen we have denominational revivals we haven't had a real stirring no no no no sir don't think we've got revivals we haven't well they got millions and millions of church members but not a revival nowhere no no the bride hasn't had a revival yet there's been no revival no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet this is right in the middle of the seals come on there's been no revival no manifesting God to stir the privacy we're looking for it it will take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again he will send it he promised it now he said she's dead then what about it but I mean you mentioned this and that's what I say on the internet under this life and like everything ain't gonna be no more revivals brother L don't understand ain't no more revival I've understood this and forty years ago I've never looked for a world wide sweeping revival because your prophet said no those are over now listen he said the life's world sweeping revival was a Zeus's Street come on he said the life's world sweeping revival was Azusa Street right in the middle of the seals the greatest revival that has ever been is transpiring right it's not a world wide sweeping revival it's a world wide sweeping revival of the opening of God's Word it spread all over the whole world from that one little man called an Azusa Street the life's world wide sweeping revival he said they ain't gonna be no more he said the next one it's the two witnesses to is rule of that form right in the midst of the said while ago right in the midst of him saying this is operating in the greatest room that I've ever operated in you think he wouldn't have it a revival you think it wasn't something to him for those seals to break that brought to him the revelation of Jesus Christ and showed him all about the Antichrist and all of the things a world wide sweeping revival of the opening of God's Word not a world wide sweeping revival of signs and wonders and different thing that said to you Wednesday night what don't you count the day of of the Holy Ghost falling on there in the Bible in the upper room when you call that a world wide sweeping revival didn't it produce a world wide sweeping revival from that from the book of Acts we yet it was not one sign or wonder in the upper room come on they wouldn't signs and wonders outside to get the people's attention those come on gradually even go over to do the Gentiles the door being opened and when you do you don't seek manifestation while we got so much on the manifestation as to something to show revival when your prophet would tell you that he was operating in the greatest room that had ever been and he said it'll take those seven unknown thunders to wake her up all right no wonder where people are not in a revival they don't know what a revival is see we Baptists knew you you'll quote it with us right that reviving is not to revive a sinner it's a Christian supposed to get revived because you can't revive a sinner it's supposed to be a Christian it was Christian straightening up and getting their lives right and God coming forth and doing as it did then the people around are beginning to see that happening and then they come to the altar to accept Jesus Christ as their Savior come on sure why can't we read the prophet and listen sitting there this morning looking where there was revival in ever church age where there's been revival after revival after revival all the way down through there but there was only certain revivals that was worldwide sweeping and this revival of em combi is only for the elect no seven unknown thunders is only for the elect it is not for the world sure they can get the effects of it and everything but it's not for them all right then the thunders being what will bring us back with the the virtues right now we see and I hope you would follow that Wednesday now we see for surety that the those seven unknown thunders is what wakes her up but have you been woke up by the word it's been revealed to you going to is it the sound of the end time sir I believe is the one go in there and get that list of the things that brother Branham was saying about that has been made known in this last day you remember what he was saying predestination straightened out one god no eternal Hill all these things like that he less about and he he comes down and he leaves out number eight from Schofield riddle and that is the bride becoming one with the work when he left that out I don't know nothing to me I don't care I disappointed work it did he left out number eight is coming down well but all of the things look what God has done for you and I look where he has brought us from by the opening of the word I mean are you afraid that if brother Dale said I'm gonna have a I'm gonna have a Baptist preacher come Sunday and straighten us out I'm gonna having to come in straighten us out on the Godhead and many of you'd be afraid to come you'd be afraid to come then you know for sure you don't understand the truth I don't I don't want to do this well I might get deceived honey don't worry about it when you've got that dog you already deceived you just ain't buying enough or woman enough to admit it what you see what it's doing God has promised us look at the point what I'm talking about the Bible promised Malachi 4 that God would send a prophet then told us what he would do turn the hearts of the children and turn Shielders fathers who turn a bow ways code it would be dealing with the spirit and power of Elijah but the last days would come down to a Gentile prophet to bring the word to return us back to the faith of the father what is the faith of the father the revelation of the father's how many gods did did the apostles how did they preach anything about eternal hell did they preach anything about all of these messed up doctrines and it wasn't from the Apostles they were the ones that straightened all of that out and laid it in order I'm just trying to get you to think if God promised something why can't we say God bring it to Pais are you afraid of the word are you afraid to put God to the point of asking him then Lord bring the truth to us if he killed every one of us right but are you listening to what I'm saying here's a prophet telling you about world wide sweeping revival yes they ain't gonna be no more world wide sweeping revival Azusa Street was the life one of those but then he talks about listen how many of these do you need that in the fifties and ona the promise of God to bring a revival and what about when he gets into the opening of the seals in the time the greatest revival the world has ever seen was to the opening of those seven seals don't say no revival I don't see them going on and now that you had it throw it in my face like this if we're were we think we are if we're were we think we are why any more signs and wonders that's exactly right there that's still unbelief that's the thing that's keeping it from happening is the fact that we're not believing it to say this is it I've had people to throw it in my face well one of that brother so-and-so he brought that to Lourdes or to soldier but that's his way now he's got a right to believe what he wants to not according to my Bible he doesn't well that's his business that's right but it's my business to tell you according to my Bible we none of us got no rights we forfeited all those rights to accept Jesus Christ it's for brother Dale you shouldn't be so hard to sign you don't listen to brother Adam raking the cold Rover sitting among the Pentecostal people in the 50s and things and teaching adoption and said that's where you messed up at on the seal book he said they cabbage down on it he said you messed up on the basis you're not believing God's Word you think he wasn't hard and strong no no he was sweet you know he was sweet all right but are you listening what revival brother devil are you talking about opening of God's Word that each day is I read God's Word in living and when he unfolds it to me that brings up into me a the greatest thing that could ever happen in the world is to God to reveal to a human being his word you're not happy about that you're not happy about what you say oh you just exalted of what you say and that's where it is right there you things out it well like one thing about it I spent my life to learn what this prophet said you started using the Walmarts and the hangouts and everything else instead of studying the Word of God but I don't want to be an inlet now don't worry about it the intellect ain't gonna do none of us no good but stupidity ain't either right oh I just want to be humble brother Dale you don't want to be humble you need to be humble I try that's my problem then once you're alright but are you listening it's gonna take the seven unknown thunders to wake the bride up it's going to take those seven unknown thunders to bring the virtues it's going to take those seven unknown thunders to bring us to rapture in faith come on what about it rapture in faith let's see if I can get this one all right we just covered it from Anna lady you see in church age where he said something must wake up the bride that's asleep something must wake her up and it must bring us to a revival listen to your prophet 1962 letting off the pressure now some of these they don't have some let me do I have kind of listened as 1962 then Elizabeth I've kind of listened and watched my Pentecostal brethren as they have predicted a sweeping revival coming and we all know that the revival that we've just went through has ceased are you reading it come on now but there must be never remember 62 this is not to seal he said it ceased but there must be coming something else that's glorious and great and so I've been studying hard to find these places in the scripture I think that if our revelation must be scriptural then we know it's right if it's a scripture it's from the Lord and I'm beginning to believe that that's right and there's coming a ripening time for the evening fruits something like he was looking for something sound like all the way through there that's what I'm just telling you listen to the message and see how that your prophet is always looking for something to take place and even after the opening of the seals he was looking for something to take place he said they'll come such a baptism of the Holy Ghost that her fill every fiber of our being and take us in the rapture was the prophet looking forward to something or was he looking at it okay here's woman this is three kind of believers 1963 1124 in the paragraph 97 that's the reason I do believe that when the bride is called out and elected and said in the book of life there will come a sound from heaven that'll take such a baptism of the Holy Spirit into that bride that'll take her from the earth in a rapture in grace God promised it church what's gonna change you and I what's going to put us into the place a rapture in faith everything is linked upon the basis of whether or not those seven thunders have sounded I can show you in the seal book things that looks like that the Prophet even questioned but when he finished the week he said that's what it's been he said it's been the angels of the Lord bringing me back here for this message he said tonight the promises of God are yin amen but to think about it wake her up restore to her the faith of the father's let's see if I can get to how much number I think we've just read it number seven yeah all right here's what I want to get to then all I don't have will get to this will quit what about a prophet crying out for awakening in our soul is there not something burdening you and troubling you as to the day and the hour that we're living and why things are running like they are you're not troubled and burdened about that you're not concerned about the age in the time and the hour that we're living well let's finish it with this they don't have this one but I got a statue of a perfect man paragraph 352 through 57 58 then God representing his church as a bride a woman God represents his church as a bride and the way he brings each individual to being his son to go in that bride he also brought the bride through those ages all right till he brings this one complete church he saw my feet moving and all in Luther can do all it but each age God has promised these things into his church and pattered it by showing that each individual has these possesses these qualities and this being when it's completed listen is the Church of God Nathan about the church right and then you Church individual listening and this being when it's completed is the Church of God going in the rapture and this being now that's the church right now listen to it and this being and completed is a servant of God in the Church of God that's going in the rapture then the whole stature of your being is governed and controlled by these things but it cannot be completely controlled until it's completely possesses these virtues what about it what do we think we've got another 40 years 50 year and I'm the guy that has stood here in 1974 and proved to you by brother Branham and the quote that we could pass the Year 2026 I said that in 74 and I'm still today even welcome to the tapes to listen to it but I did not want it to go this far and it have not wanted it to go this far and I'm not gloating in the fact that I knew that it would I know there's one thing for certain it is not time in ways and elements he said I'm scared of your experiences it's a revelation from God brother Branham says rapture message the bride would be waiting for the revelation of the rapture now the bride would be waiting for the revelation it's going to take these divinely revealed tools of the thunders to turn our hearts back it's gonna take that to bring us to a rapture in condition why are the people secured of it then why are the people scared of the seals when they afraid they can't talk on it right why the afraid of Daniel seventy weeks when your prophet said in the Daniel 70 weeks book just open the front page and read if you've got the book open entreated he says you can't understand the seals of the time if you don't understand Daniel 70 wait but why are people so scared of those things why not just try to bring what you can bring and bring it to a place that you can see it brother Dale what are you talking about I'm talking about there's like I've told you over and over and over when I started reading this message I saw God speaking to mankind not God that's brother Branham not those type of things I saw God using a man to bring his word that questions that we had little things that were so hindrance unto each one of us that he and his simplicity could explain the Godhead as you're a human being you're this you're that vain 3 have a commit so simple that we could read it and understand it and for 50 years still gaining ground reading this message it's a wonderful message to me it has the answer to every question that you have is in this message where are we willing to put it all on to that why do we want to hold just a little bit just in case why not just say this is it and let's go come on musicians what are you looking for brother day I'm not looking for I'm looking at I'm looking at the greatest revival I'll repeat it again while they're coming the greatest revival this world has ever had now listen greater than when Jesus walked here because when Jesus walked here there was no possibility of that being revealed because it was within him right and even the Holy Ghost coming on the day of Pentecost could not reveal the entire Word of God it would take God to send a prophet for our day and reading that in understanding those things and seeing that it's the greatest revival that has ever been brought around him you don't listen to something like that where he said I've seen the dead raised I've seen sick healed he said I've seen all kinds of miracles but this is he said I've never worked in this realm what was it he said this is the opening of the word by the same spirit well can't you be happy for what you've seen what you believe why can't you rejoice about where you believe that God has brought you from because look where we would be if he had to walk us that would still be out there asleep are we are we still asleep tonight today I think the word is true the greatest thing that has ever happened is right now happening but are you falling in it are you saying this is it well I'm let me be like they said if this ain't yet brought around what do you say he's let me keep this so that gets here right we'll see this is the opening of the word the most rejoicing revival that the people has ever had but yet nobody don't see the revival could it be that you spend your time reading other things I was looking at one just now and that before came out or brother Branham said talking about doing he said are these old magazines and things that you're reading and studying know more about everything else instead of the Word of God we could at least have by now have a foundation that we should not be worried about whether it'll stand it has stood the test so far down through the 70s the 80s the things and stood dark when I asked a person one time I said what if the rapture don't come by 77 they said I'll get out of the message then they said I'd say we misunderstood because it was a date or a time let's tan oh we got bread instead of the revealed word it was an idea or a concept we might have to change keys but it's a and anybody have an ad world in his hand they got the whole wide world it is hand you got you have innate the outer zone is coming let's see let's see if God lives got the wooden ACC I'm having a revival it is you know that in the moon what I had to shame I did 40 years ago I'm acting the way I did 40 years ago baby ain't died I'm still looking at the opening of the words and still enjoy reading or hearing it I love to go back in the fifties in here a message let's go up to 65 your imagination [Music] or about it [Music] everybody hey you got anybody have anything a world wide sweeping revival of the opening of God's Word because that's what I've always believed if God is revealing something in lula georgia then he's revealing it in africa he's revealing it in china he's revealing it in the india he's revealing his word because the bride is feasting upon that word she's putting on the garments she's being dressed by the Word of God what about [Music] and we got [Music] you loved him he loved him for what he's done for you how he's revealed itself [Music] [Applause] you and me you dismiss remember the services afternoon remember wait enough in the evening service father just [Music] he got the whole [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music] [Applause] [Music]
