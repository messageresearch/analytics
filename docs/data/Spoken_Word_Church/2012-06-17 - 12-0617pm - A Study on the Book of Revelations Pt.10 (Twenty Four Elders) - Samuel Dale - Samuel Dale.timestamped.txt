[26:54] singing and we appreciate it amen
[26:57] good to see in the house of the Lord and
[26:59] in the house of the Lord if you like
[27:01] turning your scripture turn to
[27:02] Revelation 1 where we've been reading
[27:09] thank you
[27:13] try to continue on our I wonder what
[27:16] we're talking about a study of the Book
[27:18] of Revelations
[27:19] going on through the the things that we
[27:22] see
[27:23] and thank God for the truth right and it
[27:27] was a day that we couldn't read these
[27:29] and even hardly talk about it because we
[27:32] would be talking about
[27:34] um man and his philosophy you know
[27:37] people have had ideas of what this meant
[27:39] to remember and and remember the the
[27:42] story wrote around told about you know
[27:44] that it would be the holy spirit with a
[27:47] little Cupid arrow shooting the people
[27:49] you know and this that or the other
[27:51] we'll see that's that was man's and his
[27:54] ideas you know
[27:55] told you one time about my
[27:57] brother-in-law talking about that big
[27:58] beast you know he saw that revelation
[28:01] that it'd be a great big King Kong you
[28:03] know walking across the Earth you know
[28:05] I said I don't think I'd fooled anybody
[28:07] religiously you know and I just
[28:11] then one man one time was talking about
[28:13] how the the buzzards remember the birds
[28:16] are in Revelations will eat off of the
[28:19] people and
[28:21] said you know it said the buzzards are
[28:23] hatching three or four
[28:24] the time now instead of like one I
[28:27] suppose all right but what do you mean
[28:30] he said well you know over there in the
[28:32] Bible where the buzzers eat off the
[28:33] people said you gotta have more buzzers
[28:35] you know I said well okay you know
[28:38] that's fine I didn't think anything to
[28:41] do with coming of the Lord but or the
[28:43] ending of all things but you know that's
[28:45] man and their ideas we've all had our
[28:47] opinions our thoughts I told you that I
[28:51] used to think as a kid that when
[28:52] somebody had told me when the Lord would
[28:54] be coming he'd come with an umbrella you
[28:57] know I don't know where I got it but you
[28:59] know every time I see a cloud come up
[29:01] I'd run out and look to see if there's
[29:02] an umbrella in it and you know if I
[29:04] didn't see an umbrella I thought well
[29:05] I'm doing pretty good I made it past
[29:07] this one you know but that's just her
[29:09] way of thinking right of the word of God
[29:11] Amen but thank God for the prophet of
[29:15] God that was sent unto us to expound
[29:18] these things and to us and now then it
[29:21] becomes so simple
[29:22] until why didn't we read these things
[29:25] ourselves you know and relate to it it
[29:28] wouldn't take see it couldn't be a
[29:29] theologian
[29:31] try to figure these things out because
[29:33] we would have the wrong thoughts and
[29:35] approach it would have to be you know
[29:37] someone uh different from that okay
[29:40] Revelations one
[29:42] your lord Jesus we love you we thank you
[29:44] for all things
[29:46] we know that you give them to us freely
[29:49] we pray that you'd come this afternoon
[29:51] and speak to our hearts
[29:53] and direct each and every one of us that
[29:55] we may see you Lord and be directed in
[29:58] your love
[29:59] and father just have your way with us
[30:01] and open our understanding and we know
[30:04] that we can talk about the word and talk
[30:06] about the symbols and how they've been
[30:08] broken and
[30:09] the prophet has delivered it unto us and
[30:12] all that's wonderful
[30:14] but anybody can talk about that
[30:17] it takes a special people as we started
[30:20] off talking about
[30:22] a special people in the Book of
[30:24] Revelations that would be able to
[30:25] understand
[30:26] this book
[30:28] you would take one with prophetic
[30:30] insight not just a prophet to bring it
[30:33] but with prophetic insight to be able to
[30:36] comprehend what has been brought unto us
[30:39] we love you and we thank you have your
[30:41] way now blessing God each one in Jesus
[30:43] name
[30:46] Revelations 1.
[30:49] 1 through three as we've been reading
[30:53] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[30:55] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[30:57] things which must shortly come to pass
[31:00] and he sin and signified it lays Angel
[31:03] unto his servant John
[31:04] who by record of the word of God and of
[31:07] the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[31:09] things that he saw
[31:10] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[31:12] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[31:16] those things which are written therein
[31:18] for the time is at hand you may be
[31:22] seated Lord had his Blessing to the
[31:25] reading of the word
[31:27] now we're trying to continue on with our
[31:31] thoughts and and you know
[31:35] trying to comprehend things
[31:38] and leading up to the Revelations
[31:40] chapter 5.
[31:42] I'm enjoying getting dark it's okay I
[31:46] know how good it'll be when we get there
[31:47] but we just appreciate it
[31:53] now remember this morning
[31:55] I tried a background before I start into
[31:58] the next message because I want you to
[32:01] see that it all ties together
[32:04] and to me what would you call it
[32:08] a multiple form of revealing or
[32:11] something you know uh what would be the
[32:13] words there I'm not a educated person
[32:16] but
[32:18] to me there's many things shown but it's
[32:20] not many different things
[32:23] it's many different uh ways or thoughts
[32:28] of seeing maybe not waves because that
[32:31] deals with putting too much into a
[32:33] problem but ways of seeing things
[32:38] from different ones you remember there
[32:40] in the Bible that one of the writers of
[32:44] the Gospel he saw one blind man
[32:48] one of the others he saw two
[32:51] well that's not a contradiction
[32:54] he's just two different people seeing it
[32:57] right you know and one of them back in
[32:59] the crowd didn't get to see the two
[33:01] the other one up there was dropped first
[33:03] and he saw the two you know the other
[33:05] one just maybe seeing one from a side
[33:07] view and and they wrote what they saw
[33:11] and you'd say well don't you believe the
[33:13] Lord could lead them to all of them get
[33:16] together about the same thing well
[33:17] that's the marvelous thing that I love
[33:20] about the word of God
[33:22] that God used man to write it
[33:26] he didn't use theologians we couldn't
[33:30] have understood it right
[33:31] you know too proper of a words you know
[33:34] in all of the big fancy you know what is
[33:38] your M good well I never didn't know
[33:41] what input meant hardly you know and I
[33:43] couldn't understand but you know and
[33:45] those big fancy words people use that's
[33:48] okay
[33:49] but it's just plain old simple language
[33:52] and anybody with us a great education or
[33:55] to be able to understand someone who
[33:58] speaks in a Common Language whereas
[34:01] maybe those in a Common Language
[34:03] couldn't comprehend what was said in the
[34:05] higher ups you know but it's like I've
[34:08] always said their life in our ways you
[34:10] go up North and and you know they want
[34:13] to say tomatoes and potatoes let's do it
[34:18] but then they'll say what'd you say you
[34:20] know
[34:21] and but if you go up there and say I
[34:24] want some Mater's and taters they'll go
[34:26] knifing all the way but they'll come
[34:28] back to what you ask for because you can
[34:30] understand knows what education can
[34:32] understand those who are not educated so
[34:35] let's get it down to where we're at
[34:37] maybe you want scripture for it the
[34:39] Common People heard him gladly all right
[34:42] so we spoke in a Common Language to
[34:45] where they could understand
[34:47] all right
[34:48] but they're just trying to get a few
[34:50] thoughts in our mind to where we can can
[34:52] look at pain and see the message is
[34:55] mourning of what
[34:57] we saw one saw the throne and then we
[35:00] saw one sitting on the throne
[35:03] but then we saw a rainbow around about
[35:07] the one that was sitting on the throne
[35:09] you know and all of these things we
[35:10] talked about in a covenant
[35:13] you know and we've seen that we don't
[35:16] see but part of it here knows when we
[35:19] get there we'll get a message of cheer
[35:21] down through time no more than we see
[35:23] the full rainbow over the earth and the
[35:26] arches of the earth you know but I said
[35:29] you look up to heaven and you see a
[35:32] rainbow around about the Sun or
[35:34] something like that or I don't know
[35:36] maybe somebody around the moon but I
[35:38] waited some time around the Sun but
[35:40] that's in the Heavenly forms to where we
[35:42] can understand
[35:44] so when we get there
[35:47] when we get there you know
[35:49] we'll see it right and we'll realize
[35:52] realization
[35:54] and that rainbow is a covenant but I
[35:58] didn't get to finish up what I said you
[35:59] could spend weeks preaching on one
[36:02] thought
[36:03] you know
[36:04] because you think about it
[36:06] you know that when we get there
[36:10] will be symbolics of things that
[36:14] happened on Earth
[36:16] but they won't be needed anymore
[36:20] but I don't believe in doing away with
[36:22] any of the attributes of God I've always
[36:24] tried to express that to you
[36:25] what we want to do away with them
[36:28] you know I mean we we have troubles at
[36:30] home because we
[36:32] you know we had a little uh things that
[36:35] the kids done or whatever and and little
[36:39] cards my wife will tell me say take
[36:41] these cards into the basement but I mean
[36:43] we got boxes of cards you know that you
[36:47] don't want to get rid of them
[36:49] you know
[36:50] because they have some meaning to you
[36:53] you know you want to hold on to that
[36:55] thought but I don't believe there would
[36:57] be anything I've always told you I
[36:59] believe when we get there you'll see the
[37:00] nail prints in his hand
[37:03] I'd be wonderful
[37:05] you said no we don't need that there are
[37:07] going to be a glorified body well
[37:09] according to the prophet when he raised
[37:11] he had male prince in his hand I thought
[37:13] he raised to the glorified body I didn't
[37:15] know
[37:16] you know that's that's just the point
[37:19] and uh
[37:21] then by being that away
[37:24] you know that when we get over there we
[37:26] won't need a covenant
[37:28] right
[37:31] now I can get this from right around him
[37:33] I just wrote that across because I
[37:34] thought it was a minute ago see if not
[37:36] finishing up this morning
[37:38] when we get there we won't need a
[37:40] covenant he said well why is the rainbow
[37:41] there then
[37:43] is there because it's wonderful
[37:47] you'll never be going away with
[37:49] it it'll always be there
[37:51] you'll always be able to see the rainbow
[37:54] the Covenant with man but we don't need
[37:58] a covenant once we're redeemed right
[38:00] that's right
[38:03] we won't need the nail prince in his
[38:06] hands
[38:08] but we'll see that what they've done for
[38:11] us
[38:12] all right
[38:14] we won't need the stripes in his back to
[38:16] heal us
[38:17] but they can be higher
[38:20] he said oh you have such a narrow mind I
[38:22] agree with you
[38:23] but I love it you know just leave me
[38:26] alone and it's not been crazy I guess
[38:28] all my life and just leave them alone
[38:30] this is the way I think
[38:32] I just think about you know him and and
[38:35] his doings and things I don't believe
[38:37] there's going to be a throne over here
[38:39] and a little Halo of light floating
[38:41] around over here you know and something
[38:43] over Yonder a dove or something you know
[38:45] and I can say well hey father where's
[38:48] the southern half well he's over here
[38:49] you know no
[38:52] Jesus said if you've seen me
[38:56] you've seen the father
[39:00] all right then there won't be any
[39:01] trouble when we get there you see that's
[39:03] too close to Oneness
[39:05] no
[39:07] you know what I'm trying to tell you is
[39:09] is the reasoning
[39:11] it's not too close to Oneness because
[39:14] the bride is the in the same form he's
[39:18] in and the one just can't handle that
[39:22] they say Jesus was the last form and I
[39:25] don't agree with it I believe the bride
[39:26] of Christ is the last form of God on the
[39:29] earth and this dispensation then they'll
[39:31] be the Jewish amen there'll be
[39:33] Redemption for them they'll be things
[39:35] you know so there's many things to to
[39:37] think about
[39:39] but just think about it the rainbow will
[39:42] be there
[39:44] but not
[39:46] as a point that it has to be there of a
[39:49] covenant
[39:50] it'll be there because that was the
[39:52] Covenant and God don't do away with
[39:55] anything
[39:56] he just he just keeps adding to as long
[40:00] as he keeps adding to
[40:02] then uh
[40:04] we'll be happy right all right now think
[40:07] about that then and think about the
[40:09] things we tried to say this morning and
[40:10] try not to back up too much
[40:12] but just to to go on let's read our
[40:15] scripture we've got nothing else to
[40:18] Revelations 4 verse 4. let's read this
[40:23] and just take on this thought
[40:29] let's read verse three to turn on back
[40:32] and he that set up on was said he that
[40:36] set was to look upon
[40:38] like a Jasper and a sardine stone there
[40:41] was a rainbow round about The Throne
[40:43] inside of like unto an emerald
[40:46] and we didn't even get to that and you
[40:48] know
[40:49] um Emerald was a skirt of color brought
[40:52] around spoke of you know like in the the
[40:54] pillar of Fire
[40:56] in the looks you know where the door
[40:58] firing the way it is in the way of it
[41:00] going you know right
[41:02] round about The Throne were Four and
[41:05] Twenty seats
[41:06] and upon the seats I saw Four and Twenty
[41:09] Elders sitting clothed in white
[41:11] arraignment and they had on their heads
[41:14] crowns of gold
[41:17] now
[41:19] Four and Twenty owners
[41:24] who is that
[41:26] we said Wellness we've known it you know
[41:29] it's the 12 apostles
[41:34] the 12 Patriarchs we've known that
[41:36] actually because the prophet has told us
[41:38] that from before
[41:40] but
[41:42] just remember then
[41:45] yet even at this time
[41:49] of what you're seeing would be the
[41:52] future when we would be there
[41:55] all right then the Old Testament people
[42:00] are getting involved
[42:03] right
[42:05] because you got to twelve
[42:07] Patriarchs
[42:10] and in doing that
[42:12] see then this Plan of Redemption has
[42:14] been a wonderful thing
[42:17] it was not just for the 12 Patriarchs
[42:21] that's just the simple part to show you
[42:24] the Old Testament is tied together
[42:26] that is the part that shows as we'll see
[42:29] in a minute that makes that rainbow
[42:32] Covenant around the throne
[42:37] because it will tie together the the the
[42:40] showing that Redemption was back there
[42:43] Waiting on Jesus Christ to pay the price
[42:47] but at this time that we're in glory
[42:50] it can go on because now you know that
[42:54] catch the point of what I'm saying and
[42:55] you'll follow the point through the
[42:57] message
[42:58] see this this goes this scene that we
[43:01] see here
[43:02] goes to the white throne
[43:07] all right
[43:09] goes to throw on judgment amen all right
[43:12] so don't get lost in your thoughts
[43:14] before we get there and try to figure it
[43:16] out you know I'm saying when all that
[43:18] that can't be us and them that are
[43:20] together where would that be you know
[43:23] well
[43:24] we just you know go along do we
[43:26] understand all right this is after the
[43:30] Rapture though
[43:33] all right
[43:34] and the reason I said now that you've
[43:36] got to tie it together to the what to
[43:38] the throne is because after the Rapture
[43:41] your Redemption is not complete
[43:45] for the 12 tribes of Israel right right
[43:48] you agree yes we go up in a Rapture yes
[43:52] so this moves us a little further over
[43:57] all right
[43:58] I hope you follow from now on because
[44:00] we're moving over more in the Book of
[44:03] Revelations
[44:05] we're moving over to like 17. we'll come
[44:09] back picking these up
[44:10] because we're moving over to the
[44:13] Judgment Throne to look at it more
[44:16] instead of just saying this is in heaven
[44:19] because in the rapture we go there
[44:22] and we will be with him in the throne
[44:26] but then there comes a time that that
[44:29] it's completed
[44:31] I'm not listen to my point
[44:35] that rainbow wouldn't be complete if
[44:37] there was people
[44:39] that was still to be redeemed now I'm
[44:42] not talking about foolish virgins to be
[44:43] given eternal life into white Throne no
[44:45] no no no no no no don't go over there
[44:48] keep witness stay where I'm at
[44:51] see the Plan of Redemption is not
[44:52] complete until Israel is redeemed
[44:56] right are you following me there's 144
[44:59] 000 to be redeemed after the Rapture of
[45:01] the bride of Christ everybody go with me
[45:03] on that all right so then the rainbow
[45:06] would be made complete see Esther
[45:09] looking at it when you're sitting on the
[45:10] throne
[45:11] me as a judgment
[45:14] without that full Plan of Redemption
[45:17] but
[45:19] we can see our part
[45:22] and that's basically what we've been
[45:24] doing up to this point
[45:26] we've been dealing and we will deal a
[45:28] minute with this here our part
[45:32] then we ended up this morning talking
[45:35] about that there's just one on the
[45:37] throne
[45:39] but that one on the throne
[45:42] is almighty God with a many membered
[45:46] body amen
[45:49] no he ain't got a body yes
[45:53] yes they're still in the symbolics
[45:57] it's the throne it's where we go when we
[45:59] leave here we go to the marriage supper
[46:02] we go to do those things you know
[46:05] but it just means that the Throne of God
[46:08] that was in the Earth
[46:10] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[46:12] in the individuals the bride of Christ
[46:14] has been made complete on Earth
[46:17] and it goes up to match that which is
[46:21] sitting there
[46:22] you know as a throne
[46:25] so we see our part of it yes
[46:28] now we're going to move over just a
[46:30] little
[46:31] and then we'll come back to our part of
[46:33] it again in Revelations 5. huh
[46:37] but see at this point you see 24.
[46:42] see it's
[46:44] and you see 24-hours
[46:47] all right
[46:49] so it's got to move over now
[46:52] up into as far as the white throne
[46:56] at this point that we would begin in
[46:58] verse 4.
[47:00] you would move over a drastic amount of
[47:02] time
[47:04] at least three and a half years
[47:07] from the time of the rapture
[47:10] to the 144 000 in their completion
[47:14] well see if you don't bring them up
[47:17] then you wouldn't have a complete
[47:19] rainbow
[47:21] now that's the reason I kept emphasizing
[47:24] this morning
[47:26] when you take the seven golden
[47:28] candlesticks the rainbow the things put
[47:31] them together you're talking about the
[47:33] bride
[47:34] seven golden candlesticks is not dealing
[47:37] with Israel
[47:41] all right right it's dealing with the
[47:45] bride of Christ through the church ages
[47:47] so when we're seeing our part
[47:49] right
[47:51] our part we come to the white I mean to
[47:54] the throne of God and it at that point
[47:58] it is not a judgment seat
[48:01] it is a raptured condition right now
[48:06] right right right
[48:09] then we'll move over to a judgment seat
[48:12] amen and judge angels and we go on down
[48:14] to work terms the Lightnings and
[48:16] thunderings
[48:18] but here is showing on whether you would
[48:21] call it an insert or what you would call
[48:23] it but it's showing that there's a 24
[48:27] elders
[48:29] so what we just realized there's 12
[48:31] Apostles and 12 Prophet you know uh
[48:35] Apostles okay
[48:39] but the only place you can bring the
[48:41] Twelve Apostles and the 12 Patriarchs
[48:44] together
[48:46] would have to be when the Plan of
[48:49] Redemption is over right amen right
[48:53] that's right
[48:55] and see that's at least three and a half
[48:57] years after week Walk The Rapture
[49:00] okay
[49:02] as at least is enough to worry that we
[49:04] we you know we want to get out of here
[49:07] and Rapture right right man so do we see
[49:10] our part now and then we'll try to pick
[49:12] back up with these 24 Elders you know
[49:17] you see that
[49:18] we come to that Throne that's not a
[49:21] judgment Throne right there in the verse
[49:23] one two three the
[49:26] it's not a judgment throne
[49:30] it's the Throne of God as we said a
[49:32] moment ago that's been in our heart
[49:34] completed upon Earth Redemption for the
[49:37] Gentiles is finished and then we go up
[49:40] in a rapture
[49:42] now makes the Throne of God complete
[49:46] see then you'll start talking about the
[49:49] Lightnings the Thunder and tonight don't
[49:51] do that just keep it step by step very
[49:54] slow
[49:55] until we get there
[49:58] all right
[49:59] but do you see our part then that we are
[50:02] actually now right by the baptism of the
[50:06] Holy Ghost
[50:09] sitting
[50:11] actually in the throne that's right amen
[50:16] because God's Throne is right here in
[50:18] our heart all right
[50:20] that's wonderful that's right that don't
[50:22] do away to watch up there
[50:27] you know what really that is there and
[50:29] if people could understand these little
[50:30] points you would understand about
[50:32] theophthans and and things like that and
[50:35] they wouldn't have a body up yonder and
[50:37] it's down here and not over there can't
[50:40] get it together
[50:42] they would understand why brother Brown
[50:43] would say your shoulders you see off me
[50:48] that's right in here
[50:50] but only how's the negative
[50:52] amen
[50:54] only how the earnest of that right
[50:57] the rest is in heaven that's just like
[51:00] the new bird in faith
[51:02] right you don't have all of these
[51:05] virtues you have portions of things
[51:07] right right but then one day when you
[51:10] attain to these virtues and The
[51:11] Headstone come you know what's been
[51:13] pulling us
[51:15] that positive right yeah it's pulling
[51:19] this upward that's right simple form of
[51:22] rapture
[51:24] being resurrected right sitting in
[51:27] Heavenly place it raising up to meet him
[51:29] and then hire right and in doing so
[51:34] when we come to the place here to match
[51:36] what's dark we're going to go to that
[51:38] terminal and that'll make you the
[51:40] Judgment Throne right there
[51:44] you you've got a mad supper
[51:48] you got other things to be involved
[51:53] Tim clubfit he said we just go from here
[51:55] to there
[51:56] well there's a lot from here to there
[51:58] you know
[52:00] I mean
[52:01] brother dick ain't tell me brother Dale
[52:04] you know
[52:06] what you call it the
[52:09] no I've been buying it
[52:12] the Statue of Liberty when he gets to
[52:14] stop and just waved at him or her or
[52:16] what's up there
[52:18] but he's been all up in there you know
[52:20] he could come back and tell me all about
[52:22] it because he's been there
[52:24] and he said can't you see right here
[52:25] Brother David standing right here we're
[52:28] right now standing right and that's the
[52:29] way preachers preaching them we're right
[52:31] now standing right here
[52:33] it
[52:35] you know the tower there
[52:39] I said no brother dick I'm right here
[52:42] you might be there because you've been
[52:44] there but I haven't been there so I
[52:46] can't be there you tell me all about it
[52:49] that's true
[52:50] all right brother random would come and
[52:52] say see I'm not saying the Lord's coming
[52:54] I'm saying he's here people say the
[52:56] Lord's here probably said he was here
[52:58] well God said he was here before the
[53:00] world ever started what I've always said
[53:02] we spent seven thousand I'm going into
[53:04] seven now
[53:06] we spent six thousand years trying to
[53:08] prove his God up in heaven he spent six
[53:10] thousand years trying to prove he's on
[53:11] Earth that's right
[53:13] we just got the thing all messed up
[53:16] but you get the point of what I'm saying
[53:19] yes we've got to complete what we said
[53:21] this morning
[53:23] before we can talk about these 24 elders
[53:28] all right
[53:30] see then when the Bride In Christ
[53:32] becomes one
[53:36] the rainbow is around about the throne
[53:43] because it's the Covenant
[53:46] because that's all of our Covenants
[53:50] then we get to it in a minute but
[53:51] there's still something left for Israel
[53:53] they got to be brought into the picture
[53:56] but
[53:57] we're not concerned with that right now
[54:01] you know anybody wants to know who the
[54:03] two witnesses is go to Israel last time
[54:05] if we do the name or address the
[54:08] telephone number and call them up and
[54:09] say good luck voters
[54:11] you got a problem when we get out of
[54:13] here
[54:16] but what else can I tell them what yeah
[54:21] see didn't we have to keep it where we
[54:23] are
[54:27] and when that Throne is completed in our
[54:29] hearts
[54:30] adoption headstone whatever you want to
[54:34] call it
[54:36] coming into our hearts and our lives
[54:38] upon this Earth
[54:40] he said well it sure don't look like it
[54:42] well it never did look like it before
[54:45] what are you going to take the example
[54:46] to judge by
[54:49] e
[54:52] but then we must get everything right
[54:54] here
[54:56] and it matches that then we'll go there
[54:58] amen then we can see we're around the
[55:00] throne we can see that we're not just
[55:02] around the throne we're on the throne
[55:06] that makes the Throne of God complete
[55:09] amen now listen to the statement unless
[55:13] that Throne is complete
[55:15] there's no need of talking about 24
[55:17] Elders right right they're around the
[55:20] throne
[55:23] you better remember if you're going to
[55:25] believe it's 24 hours you better change
[55:28] the scene for a second to remember
[55:30] that
[55:33] 12 of those 24 are the apostles
[55:37] don't you think that they're sitting on
[55:39] in the throne
[55:42] Rapture right
[55:46] let's complete our part
[55:48] right
[55:50] me
[55:51] let's get to plan a Redemption for us
[55:54] gentiles
[55:58] let's study the message and climb and
[56:00] pray and you know climb up the statue of
[56:03] a perfect man and praying
[56:05] seek God for our part amen
[56:09] don't do me any good to know what their
[56:11] party is it's wonderful to study
[56:15] what's my part
[56:17] you know
[56:20] I mean these people let's write books
[56:22] you know and they and then these people
[56:25] that read those books they just get so
[56:27] involved in reading books until you know
[56:30] they just get right in there with it
[56:33] and they're actually living out those
[56:35] things
[56:36] you know
[56:38] and that becomes what you call a fantasy
[56:40] world
[56:41] because you're right you're reading
[56:43] about what somebody else does
[56:46] and you know if you ever thought about
[56:47] all of these books that's wrote about
[56:49] kids is written by old maids and
[56:52] bachelors
[56:53] how to raise kids
[56:57] now
[57:00] there's no need of you writing a book
[57:02] about how to raise kids
[57:09] you don't know
[57:11] you've never experienced it
[57:13] until you've experienced it you don't
[57:16] know what US old dirty old Granddaddy's
[57:18] look like or talk about you think we're
[57:20] crazy man I pick that kid up and I'll
[57:22] explain tonight I'm sitting down good
[57:24] you know yeah we'll give you one yeah
[57:29] and you become so mellow
[57:33] we call it Melancholy or something I
[57:37] don't know what the word where you just
[57:39] become so soft
[57:41] but that's am I right am I telling the
[57:43] truth yes Dr Zeus
[57:46] probably never had any kids at all and
[57:48] neither one about the kids with the
[57:49] movies and the things that they made you
[57:52] know and all these other
[57:53] I've never had a kid
[57:59] but listen
[58:01] you and I have experienced something
[58:04] right yeah we've experienced a life in
[58:09] Christ amen by the new birth that's
[58:12] right we've experienced this message
[58:14] being brought into us
[58:18] we've experienced the reading of it
[58:21] right
[58:23] we've experienced even the uh
[58:26] the part that would go with it you know
[58:29] that they said well Lou ain't nothing
[58:30] but word word that's all we want to do
[58:32] is word word well
[58:34] that's all I knew there was about it
[58:36] that's all right
[58:39] and I've always said maybe we do just
[58:41] have the letter of the word but if the
[58:44] Holy Ghost could ever get that alive we
[58:46] got something
[58:47] what about the ones that don't have the
[58:50] letter of the word right how could the
[58:53] holy ghost ever make alive anything to
[58:55] them
[58:56] but just get the point
[58:59] we've got to find ourselves see
[59:01] ourselves before we enter the fourth
[59:04] verse
[59:07] and be able to to see what is
[59:10] transpiring and being able to see that
[59:13] even the fourth verse
[59:15] and then going into the fifth of the
[59:18] lightning the throne is is the Judgment
[59:20] seat
[59:23] so then let's get the right part here
[59:26] but I don't know what goes over there
[59:28] you know that's good
[59:31] but people who want to know what's going
[59:33] to go on tomorrow don't know what's
[59:35] going on today
[59:37] I'm gonna repeat that that's good
[59:39] thought I just thought of that
[59:44] girl you know what I'm talking about yes
[59:47] people are always wanting to know
[59:49] brother gave me a big old book a long
[59:50] time ago and he wanted to know about
[59:53] 1977.
[59:57] you know he wanted me to put down
[59:58] everything I could get on 77. when I
[1:00:01] never did do a thing with it I throw the
[1:00:04] book away probably not a year ago
[1:00:06] but people that say well write down what
[1:00:09] this is what does it do me write it down
[1:00:15] the Holy Ghost has got to reveal it
[1:00:17] right
[1:00:18] but you get what I'm saying see we're
[1:00:20] going to make a vast jump
[1:00:23] in these verses
[1:00:27] that's going to move on up into a a
[1:00:30] later period of time
[1:00:34] but we got to get this time right
[1:00:40] we don't know all the Mysteries by
[1:00:41] letter is one thing
[1:00:44] and I believe that's what Paul was
[1:00:45] talking about
[1:00:47] you were talking about Revelation
[1:00:49] Mysteries when he said now you you never
[1:00:52] went to jump through that's all I don't
[1:00:54] beat Paul when he said to know all
[1:00:56] Mysteries you know
[1:00:58] and I'm not charity
[1:01:00] he's not talking about Holy Ghost
[1:01:02] revealed mystery now I do not believe
[1:01:04] that I'm just as funny as I can be with
[1:01:06] you all right
[1:01:07] I believe that's intellectual learning
[1:01:10] of the word
[1:01:13] because if you understood all the
[1:01:15] Mysteries by revelation
[1:01:18] you tell me that's not love
[1:01:20] you tell me that's not charity you tell
[1:01:23] me that's not the headstone
[1:01:25] me but we just make our own thoughts
[1:01:29] about it see and we hear bread around
[1:01:31] them you say well you know we'll say
[1:01:33] something about do you know the do you
[1:01:34] know about this
[1:01:36] the Bible says the prophet said we could
[1:01:39] know all Mysteries and still not have
[1:01:41] love
[1:01:42] d
[1:01:45] well you ought to look at them say you
[1:01:47] don't think I got your love that's what
[1:01:49] you want to say to them you just saying
[1:01:51] I don't have any love all right
[1:01:55] but listen can you understand
[1:01:58] we went through uh nine
[1:02:02] non-message uses number 10.
[1:02:04] coming up to this place
[1:02:07] to understand now we must divide things
[1:02:12] then we will go a few verses and then
[1:02:14] we'll get into the fifth chapter which
[1:02:16] will bring us back down
[1:02:19] to an understanding
[1:02:21] to where we want to to start talking all
[1:02:24] right but just to get these things out
[1:02:26] of the way
[1:02:28] oh we call it a breach
[1:02:32] Ed we went to a place now that that God
[1:02:36] is not dealing in Redemption with you
[1:02:38] and I
[1:02:39] if the throne is complete
[1:02:42] and the rainbows round about the throne
[1:02:44] and the bride sitting on the throne with
[1:02:46] him
[1:02:48] because notice it didn't say the road
[1:02:50] when it said it overcomes it will sit
[1:02:52] with me in my throne
[1:02:54] because I'd want to come and sit with my
[1:02:56] father
[1:02:57] oh this it's not just something to set
[1:02:59] out on right
[1:03:01] it's a revelation
[1:03:04] at this time you and I have taken a
[1:03:06] Rapture that our studies of the Book of
[1:03:08] Revelation we've taken a rapture we went
[1:03:10] to to complete this to make the throne
[1:03:13] in heaven complete
[1:03:17] because it's got to be complete to be
[1:03:20] able to understand then the fifth
[1:03:22] chapter and the lamb coming forth
[1:03:24] because the lamb has to come from the
[1:03:26] church ages
[1:03:30] believe
[1:03:32] and we've got to get to a place to to
[1:03:35] where we understand some Gods on a man
[1:03:37] and bring it into the right view all
[1:03:39] right amen but now you get what I'm
[1:03:41] saying yes
[1:03:43] so at this time
[1:03:46] try to make the division of what you're
[1:03:48] doing
[1:03:50] and then when you make the division to
[1:03:52] see that it is the throne then you can
[1:03:56] see why the 24 Elders is around about
[1:03:59] the throne and
[1:04:03] when see at the time we're going to
[1:04:05] Rapture 12 of those the apostles is in
[1:04:09] the throne
[1:04:12] in a rapture
[1:04:15] then your scene is changing
[1:04:18] all right
[1:04:20] it's changing to a time of work There's
[1:04:24] No Redemption
[1:04:28] Redemption will be over because all this
[1:04:31] Old Testament representation and New
[1:04:33] Testament representation will be brought
[1:04:35] into view now there'll be a white Throne
[1:04:37] that people can receive eternal life but
[1:04:39] they'll never be the bride and neither
[1:04:41] will there ever be Israel
[1:04:45] did you stealing eternal life
[1:04:48] because of whatever they're doing so all
[1:04:50] right so now look what we're saying then
[1:04:53] you can understand what I'm saying since
[1:04:55] then round about the throne
[1:04:57] we're 4 and 20 seats
[1:05:01] and upon the seats I saw Four and Twenty
[1:05:04] elders
[1:05:05] all right now
[1:05:08] go ahead brother
[1:05:12] Joe Bob brother Bob okay
[1:05:14] go ahead who's there
[1:05:17] these brothers are wonderful I
[1:05:19] appreciate them they swap out to a word
[1:05:21] that at least some can sit out here
[1:05:23] sometime because those back in there
[1:05:25] they they can do the best they can but
[1:05:27] they they do it brother Joe he's back
[1:05:30] here all the time because he's handling
[1:05:33] the other parts of it you know and
[1:05:35] listen church if you ever have any
[1:05:37] problems or your family tell them your
[1:05:39] family and say well if you need me
[1:05:41] during church time
[1:05:43] don't let them call your phones and mess
[1:05:45] things up you know no just tell them to
[1:05:48] call the church
[1:05:50] and Joe will answer it and why they come
[1:05:53] out here and tell you
[1:05:55] we're not trying to hinder when we say
[1:05:57] don't turn your phones on
[1:05:59] we're trying to keep it from Green brain
[1:06:01] great
[1:06:03] and mine is the loudest of them all so
[1:06:06] if mine went off up here you would hear
[1:06:09] it downstairs easy
[1:06:11] but listen just called and tell them to
[1:06:14] call the church
[1:06:16] and give a message because Joe's are
[1:06:18] doing it we appreciate all that all
[1:06:19] right look what we're getting to
[1:06:22] and brother round what are these 24
[1:06:24] elders
[1:06:26] I'm asking that question see
[1:06:28] so questions and answers on the Hebrews
[1:06:30] part 3 57 1006 paragraph
[1:06:35] 691. now the 420 elders
[1:06:38] an elder is an overseer a notice they
[1:06:41] were 12
[1:06:42] Patriarchs and Twelve Apostles and they
[1:06:47] were sitting 12 on one side and 12 on
[1:06:50] the other
[1:06:52] well you see the division is the
[1:06:54] Redemptive plan
[1:06:58] it doesn't say 24 seats and they're just
[1:07:01] in a Mingle
[1:07:02] you've got to deal now with the Old
[1:07:05] Testament Redemption the New Testament
[1:07:07] Redemption
[1:07:09] all right
[1:07:10] because when you come to the white
[1:07:12] throne
[1:07:13] the Redemptive plan is over the 144 000
[1:07:16] done been called out sealed in and
[1:07:18] everything when you come to the white
[1:07:20] Throne now see that's that's going away
[1:07:22] on over all right
[1:07:25] I remember the 20th boilers which were
[1:07:27] the 12 Patriarchs on one side and the
[1:07:30] Old Testament The Twelve Apostles on the
[1:07:32] other side of the New Testament didn't
[1:07:35] Jesus say will sit on 12 Thrones judging
[1:07:38] the 12 tribes of Israel now see that's
[1:07:41] Luke 22 and 30.
[1:07:44] but he said that we would sit on the
[1:07:46] 12th we'll we'll sit on 12 Thrones
[1:07:49] that's us
[1:07:51] judging the 12 tribes of Israel
[1:07:55] because we're going to judge the whole
[1:07:57] thing amen irregardless of them being
[1:08:00] representative as a patriarch
[1:08:02] and a wonderful position
[1:08:05] you know that they have to be judged
[1:08:09] all right
[1:08:11] so we're going to judge the 12 tribes of
[1:08:13] Israel not 144 000.
[1:08:17] I'm just personally putting it
[1:08:19] if we don't set if we don't have to sin
[1:08:21] before the Judgment 144 000 that are
[1:08:24] given eternal life here or after we
[1:08:26] leave I don't believe they'll stand the
[1:08:28] fight before that either it's the 12
[1:08:30] tribes
[1:08:32] it's not 144 000 because they're giving
[1:08:35] eternal life here so you don't have
[1:08:36] anything to be judged that the white
[1:08:37] Throne all right She'll follow him
[1:08:39] all right he covers the foundation thing
[1:08:41] he said 12.
[1:08:43] is that worship number you see and
[1:08:46] there's a 20 and 4 would be 24 12
[1:08:51] Apostles
[1:08:54] and 12 Patriarchs they're sitting at the
[1:08:57] Throne all right
[1:08:59] so now
[1:09:00] this is coming to a position
[1:09:04] to a judgment seat
[1:09:08] okay
[1:09:10] a judgment is going to take place so
[1:09:12] we'll get to learn just a minute but
[1:09:14] let's just keep reading till we get our
[1:09:16] number two really
[1:09:18] matches Revelation chapter 4 part 2
[1:09:21] 61 101 paragraph three oh seven
[1:09:26] now we read it or did we read it let's
[1:09:29] make sure we'll read it in the fourth
[1:09:31] verse
[1:09:33] and I saw Four and Twenty Elders sit in
[1:09:35] clothes in white Rhema
[1:09:38] and they had on their heads crowns of
[1:09:42] gold so now this group of people is
[1:09:45] going to have to have you'll see it a
[1:09:47] minute we'll get to it without time
[1:09:50] what means righteousness and because
[1:09:52] there were ropes show that they were
[1:09:54] priests or judges
[1:09:56] Monroe priest judges Prophet so forth
[1:09:58] see what they were they were White Road
[1:10:01] the 20 and four Elders there will be 20
[1:10:04] and four Elders there will be 12 of them
[1:10:07] for the 12 tribes of Israel
[1:10:09] The Twelve Apostles for the church and
[1:10:12] they said in the courts of the great
[1:10:14] king
[1:10:15] remember they're sitting out there these
[1:10:17] are and here's the Bride In Christ
[1:10:20] sitting on his throne and his wife
[1:10:23] sitting by him
[1:10:24] the church the 20 and 40 Elders 144
[1:10:29] 000 units of the temple ministering to
[1:10:31] him where he gets up if life goes with
[1:10:35] him oh my through that great age that's
[1:10:38] coming when all the sin and the even the
[1:10:41] resemblances TNT everything is totally
[1:10:44] gone go on to the next one number three
[1:10:47] Revelation chapter 4 which is the
[1:10:50] message 12 31. this is part one of it
[1:10:54] all right no that's wrong
[1:10:57] he said on the throne
[1:11:00] he wasn't no more back down in the
[1:11:02] candlesticks
[1:11:04] now on Earth
[1:11:07] the Rapture it doesn't come
[1:11:09] he was in glory sitting on his throne I
[1:11:13] want you to notice on down
[1:11:15] we'll find even in the fifth chapter
[1:11:19] it was not the Throne of Mercy
[1:11:22] so when you enter the fifth chapter
[1:11:23] remember there'll be an old Throne of
[1:11:25] Mercy
[1:11:29] you'll see that wind at the seals us to
[1:11:32] Israel
[1:11:33] we get the revelation of the seal to
[1:11:36] seals himself deal with Israel
[1:11:41] it was not the Throne of Mercy it wasn't
[1:11:44] the Throne of Mercy anymore it was the
[1:11:46] Throne of judgment it wasn't the throne
[1:11:48] of grace it's the Throne of judgment
[1:11:51] Rex verse verse 5 covers this the Throne
[1:11:54] of judgment because fire and Lightnings
[1:11:56] and thundering issued for no more merch
[1:11:58] is over the church age is finished in
[1:12:00] this filthy let him be filthy still in
[1:12:02] his righteous blame and righteous deal
[1:12:04] yes holy let him be holy no more
[1:12:07] a throne of Mercy
[1:12:10] so now we're dealing with the split
[1:12:12] Parts see
[1:12:15] we're going now to move really and if
[1:12:18] you technically want to go over you'll
[1:12:19] go back to 17th it is 17th chapter where
[1:12:22] the black throne's at somewhere on over
[1:12:25] it picks up
[1:12:29] no one asked me after that
[1:12:32] was my my Thrones and we come back right
[1:12:35] in the room with that teams would have
[1:12:37] to be on a little later okay but anyhow
[1:12:39] the white Throne would be on over there
[1:12:40] where you could translate way over and
[1:12:43] see things
[1:12:44] what's going to happen between here and
[1:12:46] dire
[1:12:47] is going to be revealed
[1:12:50] to where we can see it all right
[1:12:53] so we see it see this is after the
[1:12:55] Rapture
[1:12:56] this is the Judgment seat
[1:12:59] all right look at number four
[1:13:05] this is Revelation chapter four part 2
[1:13:08] 61 101
[1:13:10] you talking about throwing up yeah I
[1:13:12] want you to notice that this was not a
[1:13:14] throne of grace no more
[1:13:16] the blood had been gone and the
[1:13:18] sacrifice was back again
[1:13:20] and they had been accepted and the blood
[1:13:22] was off The Mercy Seat
[1:13:24] it was now judgment seed
[1:13:27] because Thunders and Lightnings issued
[1:13:29] out of it is that right remember it was
[1:13:31] like Mount Sinai when Moses went on
[1:13:33] Mount Sinai what happened under the
[1:13:35] lightning even if coward came for a
[1:13:37] sheep or anyone even touched the
[1:13:39] mountain it must die
[1:13:42] and he drops down to here stood Moses up
[1:13:45] there with the colors of God's flashing
[1:13:48] Lightnings emeralds around him watch
[1:13:50] them Commandments to be written and
[1:13:52] things going down just to show you a
[1:13:54] judgment seat it was now nothing could
[1:13:57] stand there before but the redeemed
[1:14:00] Sinners could not approach it at all
[1:14:02] it's finished the Judgment seat now he's
[1:14:04] not saying the redeemed stand before the
[1:14:07] Judgment seat
[1:14:09] the redeems that on the judgments then
[1:14:14] judging the others because that's what
[1:14:16] the scripture says in First Corinthians
[1:14:19] 6 and 2 that you even judge angels
[1:14:22] all right now I like what those kids
[1:14:26] was doing while ago when they're singing
[1:14:29] and I don't know who come up with that
[1:14:31] idea or Rachel
[1:14:33] where the people stood up
[1:14:36] High Ohio some of you is getting sleepy
[1:14:41] and oops that's back down
[1:14:45] snow
[1:14:55] but think about it
[1:14:58] this is a hard message maybe to try to
[1:15:01] bring because
[1:15:02] your mind is in a thought
[1:15:06] a thought pattern me and it must be
[1:15:10] brought to a change of that thought
[1:15:11] pattern but once you see it
[1:15:15] then you'll easily see the seals is not
[1:15:17] to Israel I mean to the bride
[1:15:21] the Revelation is to the bride
[1:15:25] if we go up and run
[1:15:32] what would be your thoughts
[1:15:34] all right that's not covered while ago
[1:15:37] would you say or this morning I really
[1:15:39] was yeah but you say look Revelation 10
[1:15:41] 7.
[1:15:43] wonderful
[1:15:44] that's God going to Israel
[1:15:49] and that's John looking back and seeing
[1:15:51] another Prophet with the sale of church
[1:15:53] AIDS can reveal the word
[1:15:57] amen well you better go down to
[1:15:59] Revelations 10 1. you don't hear that
[1:16:03] preach them
[1:16:04] run around and said Revelation 10 1 was
[1:16:07] the same as Revelations 1 13.
[1:16:11] which is right for them
[1:16:16] come on Folger all I've ever tried to do
[1:16:18] is just get us to see our day
[1:16:19] I don't know where we're going to the
[1:16:21] combat base we may have one message
[1:16:24] but everybody agrees that the first
[1:16:27] combat beats the line was God Among the
[1:16:30] people
[1:16:32] oh God among good people amen
[1:16:35] man God Among the people Eagle Run
[1:16:38] Around
[1:16:41] I swear the couple
[1:16:44] and you go riding down the road
[1:16:47] and you look at people's houses
[1:16:50] that are not even Christians and they
[1:16:52] got Eagles on them
[1:16:54] my sister in the age right that's right
[1:16:57] flying high going into the skies
[1:17:00] interplanatory travel yeah
[1:17:03] right right
[1:17:07] we see church just trying to stay with
[1:17:09] me
[1:17:10] and what I'm saying
[1:17:12] if we're going to judge Angels it's not
[1:17:14] before the rapture we don't judge here
[1:17:16] on Earth
[1:17:17] all right
[1:17:21] where commanded not to judge here
[1:17:25] we wait
[1:17:27] until judgment is needed out at a
[1:17:30] correct time
[1:17:34] but you see where we're at look at
[1:17:35] number five
[1:17:40] let's give you a short point just to let
[1:17:43] you see the prophet saying it the church
[1:17:45] age book page 279
[1:17:47] she could never be in the Judgment
[1:17:49] because sin cannot be imputed to her
[1:17:54] Romans 4 8. see we don't go to the white
[1:17:57] throne
[1:17:59] we don't cover that in a message two or
[1:18:02] three weeks ago
[1:18:03] we don't have to go to the white room
[1:18:06] we miss the tribulation we missed away
[1:18:09] from them as soon as the man to whom the
[1:18:12] Lord will not imbue sin but indeed she
[1:18:14] shall be with him in his throne of
[1:18:17] judgment judging the world and even
[1:18:19] angels
[1:18:22] she's going to be with you
[1:18:24] good now
[1:18:27] going down to the next see we're going
[1:18:29] to be
[1:18:31] watch who this comes to this is the 70
[1:18:33] weeks of Daniel
[1:18:35] 61 806 paragraph 162. what's the filter
[1:18:39] that's the sleeping virgins and then
[1:18:41] they comes up for the Judgment way over
[1:18:43] a year we'll get that on another bath
[1:18:46] when we continue this one over
[1:18:49] where she comes up to the white Throne
[1:18:51] of judgment
[1:18:52] now the foolish virgin nothing
[1:18:56] and has to be judged
[1:18:59] by the redeemed
[1:19:01] that's right right amen until we can
[1:19:05] preach weeks on the Judgment seat
[1:19:08] but you want to understand the right not
[1:19:10] to not just go before because you don't
[1:19:12] say it you know she sits on the Judgment
[1:19:14] seat with him
[1:19:16] if we believe the Rapture puts a throne
[1:19:19] back to the correct order why wouldn't
[1:19:22] you believe that when you go to the
[1:19:24] judgment
[1:19:26] you would never see him without hurt
[1:19:29] that's a wonderful thing
[1:19:36] who are these
[1:19:39] let's just take a couple of quotes and
[1:19:41] then we'll get to a call
[1:19:43] go ahead with number seven
[1:19:46] Revelation chapter 4 part 2 61 101
[1:19:49] paragraph 286. now the 20 and four
[1:19:52] elders
[1:19:53] I want you to notice
[1:19:55] they were not Angelic beings
[1:20:00] angels are not associated
[1:20:03] Heavenly beings are not associated with
[1:20:07] crowns and Thrones
[1:20:10] if you reach out a verse 4 with our its
[1:20:13] covers that they will be given
[1:20:16] you'll have white robe and they will
[1:20:18] have crowns
[1:20:22] did you read it Revelations 4
[1:20:25] .
[1:20:27] and I saw 420 Elders sitting clothed in
[1:20:31] white Rhema
[1:20:32] which is the righteousness of the Saints
[1:20:35] and bread on their heads crowns of gold
[1:20:38] okay
[1:20:42] be Heavenly beings are not associated
[1:20:43] with crowns and Thrones see they were
[1:20:46] never Associated they're Angels they
[1:20:48] never did overcome
[1:20:50] if you notice a little later on the
[1:20:53] songs that they sang
[1:20:56] no that's not the bride
[1:20:58] this sings the song of redemption over
[1:21:00] later
[1:21:02] but you'll pick her up in Revelation 5
[1:21:04] in heaven she can sing but then the
[1:21:07] others when it goes on over
[1:21:10] there'll be a time Israel is taken over
[1:21:13] things are happening what
[1:21:16] only they sing with they sang the song
[1:21:19] of redemption so Angels don't need to be
[1:21:21] redeemed see they're all right but they
[1:21:24] are were redeemed men go ahead and get
[1:21:27] the license Glory through it number
[1:21:29] eight
[1:21:31] Revelation chapter 4 part 3 61 108
[1:21:34] paragraph 74. and we found out that
[1:21:37] these were elders and the Elder is never
[1:21:40] applied to an angel or a being
[1:21:43] it is a redeemed human being Elders
[1:21:47] because they throngs crowns and
[1:21:49] dominions is never referred to to Angels
[1:21:52] but the crowns and Thrones so forth
[1:21:55] pertain to human beings and these Elders
[1:21:58] were crowned and clothed and sitting on
[1:22:00] Thrones we found that they were found
[1:22:04] them over other parts of the scripture
[1:22:06] that they were the 12 apostles and they
[1:22:09] were the 12 Patriarchs 20 and four of
[1:22:12] them which means 24 12 Apostles 12
[1:22:15] Patriarchs all right now
[1:22:20] so when you come to the Judgment of the
[1:22:23] white room
[1:22:25] those 12 Patriarchs can sit there
[1:22:31] but they don't sit in our Park
[1:22:35] they run around and emphasize if you'll
[1:22:37] notice
[1:22:38] 12 on one side
[1:22:41] and 12 on the other you didn't mingle
[1:22:44] them together he didn't say 24 elders
[1:22:46] he said 12 on one side 12 on the other
[1:22:49] he's dividing the Redemptive plan
[1:22:55] see we go up in a rapture
[1:22:58] Israel don't go up
[1:23:00] it's just time for them to get their
[1:23:02] Redemption all right but when you reach
[1:23:05] this position
[1:23:08] then you've reached the position of
[1:23:10] understanding that they can sit there
[1:23:12] around the Throne of God
[1:23:16] and brother random we just read there he
[1:23:17] said they said on Trump
[1:23:23] they said on the 12 apostles
[1:23:26] the 12th Patriots
[1:23:28] you know I used to wonder a statement
[1:23:30] run around a maid until one day on the
[1:23:32] disclaimed what the word are you
[1:23:33] thinking man
[1:23:35] you know I give myself chewing out
[1:23:37] sometime but
[1:23:40] you know over and later in about 21 22
[1:23:43] that takes 12 foundations
[1:23:47] in each one of those foundations got a
[1:23:48] name written
[1:23:51] blood runs it's John saw his name
[1:23:59] you know I wondered how did he see his
[1:24:02] name
[1:24:03] you know what I read the Bible
[1:24:07] they said it was
[1:24:09] 12 foundations and each one of those
[1:24:12] foundations you know they're signified
[1:24:14] by emeralds and Arctic Stones etc etc
[1:24:18] but in each one of them was a name
[1:24:21] written you know John Shaw's name
[1:24:27] so he rejoice when he looked over and
[1:24:29] saw his name
[1:24:30] but you know that is over about the last
[1:24:32] of the book
[1:24:34] and then he comes back to Earth and
[1:24:36] tries to tell us about it around said he
[1:24:38] even heard the Thunder
[1:24:41] the city couldn't ride it
[1:24:43] because he was forbidden too
[1:24:46] when you understand what I'm trying to
[1:24:48] divide
[1:24:51] one two and three
[1:24:55] we are in heaven
[1:24:57] the throne is completed
[1:25:01] there's a three and a half year period
[1:25:03] at least
[1:25:05] 300 plus Millennium all right there's a
[1:25:08] thousand three and a half years getting
[1:25:10] it right
[1:25:11] between the time that we are at the
[1:25:13] throne and the Rapture in the white
[1:25:15] Throne judgment can happen go to life
[1:25:17] through the millennium
[1:25:24] could jump that far but here's the
[1:25:27] secret of what I'm trying to tell you to
[1:25:28] where you can get it
[1:25:30] tell them the seals is not to the Bride
[1:25:33] of Jesus Christ
[1:25:35] but the revelation of the seals to the
[1:25:38] bride
[1:25:40] I don't want to be there the ass brought
[1:25:42] around and said well well Thessalonians
[1:25:44] were the man was sitting sitting in
[1:25:46] Temple Of God joined himself to be as
[1:25:48] God said does that fulfill the first
[1:25:49] Hill he said yes
[1:25:51] and only the only question he got
[1:25:53] sensible out of all the seal questions
[1:25:56] and answers now I'm just honest now
[1:25:58] there were sincere question of whether a
[1:26:00] woman should wear a pajamas you know or
[1:26:02] whatever and that was on people's hearts
[1:26:05] maybe not in that and right there but
[1:26:07] you know what I'm talking about it it
[1:26:08] was dark
[1:26:09] or whether it should be this way or
[1:26:11] brother random should we baptized father
[1:26:13] son Holy Ghost
[1:26:14] I was wearing the questions and answers
[1:26:16] you know
[1:26:17] but he had one question
[1:26:21] and that was the only one related to the
[1:26:23] seals
[1:26:25] don't you think he was a Brokenhearted
[1:26:29] you know what he'd come out and said
[1:26:35] who knows what he said when he come out
[1:26:37] on the seventh seal
[1:26:39] are finishing the sixth because of being
[1:26:42] a prophet he said it's gone from you
[1:26:46] and there's no way for you to know it
[1:26:52] now I'm not quoting I'm quoting brother
[1:26:54] random
[1:26:57] see people said but I was sitting there
[1:26:59] when
[1:27:00] amen
[1:27:04] he said it's gone from me but sitting
[1:27:07] right around the coming of the Lord
[1:27:09] whatever happens
[1:27:12] well I kind of think
[1:27:14] that maybe we might be somewhere around
[1:27:17] that
[1:27:18] I said that probably in more about 68
[1:27:22] and I surely mean it a whole lot more
[1:27:25] here
[1:27:26] you know
[1:27:27] in 2012 right
[1:27:31] right
[1:27:32] I was wanting it to happen then I
[1:27:35] certainly want it to happen now
[1:27:37] but get what I'm saying see this right
[1:27:40] here is a proof of concrete anchor
[1:27:43] to prove that the seals and after that
[1:27:46] the bride run around and I read them to
[1:27:48] you over and over the ride goes up
[1:27:50] before one not seen the night till 19.
[1:27:55] and one message emphatically even States
[1:27:57] 1921 which is actually the the 19th
[1:28:01] Chapter when the bride comes back riding
[1:28:03] on white horses with him into the
[1:28:05] millennium
[1:28:08] we see people that still haywireless
[1:28:10] people listening right now but they're
[1:28:12] just probably cutting their computers
[1:28:13] off and cutting off today they say that
[1:28:16] dummy
[1:28:18] we're over here we're over there what do
[1:28:21] you mean children
[1:28:23] well we go up before seal
[1:28:28] veteran said before Shield was rapture
[1:28:33] but is that the opening of the forcing
[1:28:38] because you better remember
[1:28:40] the fourth seal
[1:28:42] is the battle of Armageddon
[1:28:47] and according to my understanding of all
[1:28:50] the years of studying the prophet
[1:28:52] the battle of Armageddon is at the end
[1:28:56] of the three and a half year
[1:28:59] for the tribulation
[1:29:04] now if you want to get we'll get right
[1:29:06] in the book and study from there
[1:29:09] three and a half years of tribulation
[1:29:11] the battle of Armageddon is right at the
[1:29:13] end of it
[1:29:14] so you know what that put us that put us
[1:29:16] in the Bible right there at the Battle
[1:29:17] of armed again
[1:29:19] that means we've been through the
[1:29:20] tribulations that's what man's ideas
[1:29:24] what I'm trying to get you to see
[1:29:27] the seals is not too much
[1:29:31] Mr Israel
[1:29:35] but we read the book
[1:29:38] and we know the things
[1:29:42] the Old Testament listen to what I'm
[1:29:44] saying because it's I'm trying to cried
[1:29:46] for 40 years to explain
[1:29:49] the Old Testament is not to you and I am
[1:29:54] right
[1:29:56] it was the Israel
[1:29:59] you pick us up in our gentiles
[1:30:01] brought in and things
[1:30:04] but the revelation of what happened in
[1:30:06] Genesis
[1:30:08] is given to you and I that's right
[1:30:14] but you know that really given to Israel
[1:30:19] we glean from that as the bride of
[1:30:21] Christ to understand just as far back
[1:30:23] that away and we don't understand just
[1:30:25] as far that away
[1:30:26] what a beautiful thing amen
[1:30:29] to understand the Plan of Redemption
[1:30:33] but if you don't get nothing of the
[1:30:34] message get this point
[1:30:36] we stopped this morning in a certain
[1:30:38] spot reviewed a little bit showing that
[1:30:41] we're in the Rapture now this is going
[1:30:44] to the electrum
[1:30:47] and we sit with him in the white drone
[1:30:50] judging
[1:30:52] and The Twelve Apostles is going to be
[1:30:55] there
[1:30:56] with the 12 Patriarchs is going to be
[1:30:58] there
[1:31:00] and those Patriarchs will be dealing
[1:31:02] with judgment of Israel
[1:31:05] the 12 apostles will be dealing with the
[1:31:08] Judgment of the Gentiles
[1:31:11] so then the Judgment seat will cover
[1:31:13] everybody
[1:31:15] we better be sitting on that instead of
[1:31:17] walking before it
[1:31:19] amen that's right no longer a throne of
[1:31:23] Mercy the prophet says Thunders and
[1:31:25] Lightnings are coming
[1:31:29] but showing this for a second that's
[1:31:31] showing that we
[1:31:33] have crowns and things
[1:31:36] because when we enter the fifth chapter
[1:31:38] we're going to read where we are priests
[1:31:41] and Kings
[1:31:45] Kings have crowns
[1:31:52] like on these things
[1:31:55] he's trying to get a point to you
[1:31:58] through the next messages now we won't
[1:32:00] be dealing
[1:32:01] with the bride on Earth
[1:32:05] if we see any glimpse of her in between
[1:32:09] Revelations 4 and 19 it will be in a
[1:32:13] Heavenly scene
[1:32:19] right
[1:32:20] not on the Earth
[1:32:28] all right now the reason the Rapture
[1:32:31] comes on the fourth seal
[1:32:34] is that it is a spiritual condition
[1:32:39] and we right now
[1:32:41] are in the greatest battle ever fought
[1:32:47] right now it's the greatest battle ever
[1:32:49] found
[1:32:50] I believe right now in this end time
[1:32:52] where we're at
[1:32:54] is the greatest battle that's ever been
[1:32:56] fought with a human mind
[1:32:58] I've come down through the message 40
[1:33:00] something years now
[1:33:03] never seen the like at the doctrines
[1:33:05] that have flown
[1:33:08] from good Brothers
[1:33:12] and I'm having to battle that in my mind
[1:33:16] and say is that right
[1:33:20] sounds good
[1:33:23] what is it right
[1:33:31] it's going on right now
[1:33:33] the battle of Armageddon spiritually
[1:33:35] speaking is in your heart and your life
[1:33:37] right now your brain really because in
[1:33:40] your heart is God living trying to
[1:33:42] control the rest right it's a great
[1:33:44] battle
[1:33:48] you notice and I do too I'll get to a
[1:33:50] point
[1:33:52] and I'll be there and people are
[1:33:55] following that point
[1:33:57] and just didn't get to where I want to
[1:33:59] make that next step
[1:34:02] they lay out
[1:34:05] and miss the next service or two
[1:34:13] folks I didn't preach too long
[1:34:16] maybe it's time for me to quit
[1:34:19] but you see I don't understand that
[1:34:23] I don't understand how you can be so
[1:34:25] involved
[1:34:26] and what somebody's saying
[1:34:31] and they've given you a
[1:34:34] porterhouse steak
[1:34:37] and promised you what's above a
[1:34:38] porterhouse I'm not
[1:34:42] okay
[1:34:45] what's that big old word
[1:34:52] and you say make sure you come back
[1:35:01] I was preaching one time and brother
[1:35:03] said going to my office and he said
[1:35:05] brother Dale I'm leaving the church
[1:35:07] after 23 years he said I'm leaving
[1:35:13] I said do yourself a favor
[1:35:19] he said what
[1:35:20] I said don't leave this morning
[1:35:24] well I finish the evening surface
[1:35:28] I begged you
[1:35:30] please brother don't
[1:35:34] preach on something
[1:35:37] foreign
[1:35:42] no you don't
[1:35:47] exactly right you want my answer to read
[1:35:49] and I knew we didn't know if he knowed
[1:35:52] he wouldn't have been going out the door
[1:35:57] but I said you don't know what I'm going
[1:36:00] to preach on it and I would beg you to
[1:36:02] come this evening he did
[1:36:08] I never understood that
[1:36:11] but you know what it helps me sometimes
[1:36:14] because then I realized it probably the
[1:36:17] biggest force of the people didn't get
[1:36:19] it
[1:36:21] the ones that stayed maybe someone
[1:36:23] didn't get it so
[1:36:25] I said well Lord we just smacked up and
[1:36:27] start again
[1:36:30] we're going to go through this again
[1:36:32] amen right
[1:36:34] yeah we just back up and start another
[1:36:38] series
[1:36:40] somebody that's all for the right
[1:36:42] benefit I don't know
[1:36:45] I'm just trying to do what I can do come
[1:36:48] on music
[1:36:50] but if you followed what I said today
[1:36:52] this evening you can see that those
[1:36:55] seals and the things
[1:36:59] they happen after we gone
[1:37:03] because it's going to bring up now
[1:37:06] listen as I'm finishing
[1:37:08] I'll review just a tab maybe in a
[1:37:10] message I don't plan to go next
[1:37:14] but
[1:37:15] that 144 000 got to be brought in
[1:37:20] No Redemption goes to Israel right
[1:37:22] around said read you see a book he said

[1:37:31] get to the white Throne they got to be
[1:37:32] brought in
