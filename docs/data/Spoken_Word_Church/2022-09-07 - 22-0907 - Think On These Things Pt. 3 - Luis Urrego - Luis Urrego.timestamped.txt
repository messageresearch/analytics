[6:06] text message from brother joe there was
[6:08] an accident on 95.
[6:10] um he said possibly there could have
[6:12] been a fatality there
[6:14] so

[6:21] route get on 85 get on exit 40 come come
[6:24] down pass by your house by the way
[6:26] [Laughter]
[6:28] and uh to get here so to avoid that

[6:35] um
[6:36] so
[6:37] we're gonna
[6:38] go ahead and just go to the lord in
[6:40] prayer and uh
[6:41] um
[6:42] and let's just
[6:43] by our heads our heavenly father
[6:46] we thank you lord once again for the
[6:47] opportunity that we have lord to
[6:50] meditate upon your word lord
[6:52] father god we don't want to take that
[6:54] lightly lord jesus because it's your
[6:56] word father and that same word lord
[6:59] created father god the heavens and the
[7:01] earth lord jesus
[7:03] that same word heavenly father creates
[7:05] the animals lord that we see all around
[7:08] us
[7:09] and that same creative word father is
[7:11] creating and shaping us father in this
[7:13] hour lord
[7:14] father god through your holy spirit and
[7:16] we just thank you for that we ask you
[7:18] lord that you would just have your way
[7:20] here tonight lord forgive us for all of
[7:22] our sins and iniquities cleanse us lord
[7:25] if if there's anything father
[7:27] that we may have done or said or even
[7:30] thought about lord that was contrary to
[7:32] your word lord we pray father that it be
[7:35] placed under the blood lord that it
[7:37] would not hinder us from receiving
[7:39] father from your word and let his father
[7:42] lay aside all the weights and the sins
[7:43] that would so easily beset us lord and
[7:46] help us father god to be able to run
[7:48] this race of patience
[7:49] granted lord jesus meet every need
[7:51] amongst us father and bless those that
[7:53] might steal on their way we comma commit
[7:56] this time into your hands i i yield my
[7:58] my members to you lord
[7:59] have your way here this evening in jesus
[8:01] christ's name amen
[8:04] amen praise the lord jesus
[8:06] let's turn to philippians chapter four
[8:08] philippians chapter four i know we we i
[8:12] wanted to continue on this thought
[8:14] on this thought
[8:16] on think on these things
[8:18] this is part three of think on these
[8:20] things and
[8:23] i just want to say beforehand before we
[8:25] read i i i may touch on a subject
[8:28] tonight that
[8:29] that it might it might be a little
[8:34] might be a little bit uncomfortable to
[8:35] touch
[8:36] but i think it's needful to be to be
[8:38] touched upon and so um
[8:42] you just pray for us
[8:43] and uh and just let the lord have his
[8:46] way amen and that that we would just say
[8:48] things you know that that it would it
[8:50] would it would uh it would uplift us and
[8:53] they would it would help us
[8:55] because
[8:56] i you know when i think when i when when
[8:58] i when i think about this this topic
[9:01] i'm mostly thinking about our young
[9:03] people and
[9:05] and of course it affects us all right
[9:07] but i think about our young people a lot
[9:09] because they are constantly bombarded
[9:11] with thoughts
[9:14] even more now than than ever than we
[9:16] have ever faced because let me tell you
[9:19] us older ones you know we had one line
[9:22] of thinking only one source was maybe
[9:25] bombarding us
[9:27] but now they have multiple sources
[9:29] bombarding them from every angle
[9:32] from every angle and so now it's it's a
[9:35] whole soup of different things
[9:38] that they have to deal with that we
[9:40] didn't have to deal with when when when
[9:42] you know when we were growing up
[9:44] so um
[9:46] so i think it's important to to to touch
[9:48] upon these things so
[9:50] uh in philippians chapter 4 verse 4
[9:53] we'll read the scripture and
[9:55] and
[9:56] then you may be seated it says rejoice
[9:57] in the lord alway
[9:59] and again i say rejoice
[10:03] that is a commandment
[10:06] rejoice
[10:07] let your moderation be known unto all
[10:11] men
[10:11] the lord is at hand
[10:14] be careful for nothing now that doesn't
[10:17] mean you know don't take care of
[10:18] yourself or don't be careful it means
[10:20] don't worry
[10:21] be careful don't worry about anything
[10:22] but in everything by prayer and
[10:25] supplication with thanksgiving
[10:28] with thanksgiving let your requests be
[10:31] made known unto god
[10:33] amen god remember what we were talking
[10:35] about the other day god wants you to
[10:36] approach him with your requests
[10:39] amen he wants you to approach the throne
[10:41] what with boldness right
[10:44] and the peace of god which passeth all
[10:48] understanding
[10:49] shall keep your hearts
[10:51] watch and minds
[10:54] through christ jesus
[10:57] and then he says continues to say and
[10:59] this is i love this scripture verse 8
[11:01] finally brethren
[11:03] he's talking to brothers now
[11:05] all right brothers and sisters
[11:07] whatsoever things are true
[11:09] whatsoever things are honest
[11:12] how many like to to hear truth
[11:15] how how many like to to have people tell
[11:17] you false things
[11:20] i'm the only one reason
[11:24] how many how many like it when people
[11:26] are honest with you
[11:28] all right
[11:29] well this is what paul is telling us
[11:30] that whatsoever things are true
[11:33] whatsoever things are honest
[11:35] whatsoever things are just
[11:38] whatsoever things are pure
[11:40] how many love pure things
[11:43] whatsoever things are lovely
[11:45] i love lovely things
[11:47] or you do too
[11:49] whatsoever things are of good report in
[11:51] other words whatsoever things have a
[11:53] good testimony right
[11:55] if there be any virtue if the union of
[11:57] anything has virtue or if there is
[11:59] anything that that is worthy of praise
[12:01] think on these things
[12:04] all right
[12:05] and that's a commandment from paul
[12:07] he says think on these things
[12:11] these things which you have both learned
[12:13] and received and heard and seen in me
[12:16] do
[12:17] and the god of peace shall be with you
[12:19] you may be seated this afternoon
[12:22] praise the lord jesus
[12:25] amen
[12:28] as i said before you know this scripture
[12:30] has has helped me
[12:32] out
[12:33] in the in the last
[12:34] two three years you know i've really
[12:37] tried to put my my my concentration on
[12:39] this on the scripture
[12:41] more than i have in the past because
[12:44] um
[12:45] i i think it's needful i think i think
[12:48] in the last two or three years we've
[12:50] been bombarded with
[12:52] all kinds of information from left and
[12:54] right all kinds of propaganda from left
[12:57] and right and all kinds of things that
[13:00] that that have
[13:01] uh that have come to manipulate the the
[13:05] the behaviors of people
[13:08] people are not acting the way they acted
[13:09] three years ago
[13:11] uh
[13:12] people are walking now in fear
[13:15] people are now walking in in in it
[13:18] you know leery of one another now
[13:22] you know
[13:23] and and what's this guy you know what
[13:26] you know
[13:28] and worse than that they
[13:30] you were put behind masks and things
[13:32] like that which makes you look like you
[13:34] know you're even more leader you look
[13:36] like a criminal
[13:38] well criminals are the ones that wear
[13:40] masks
[13:41] because they don't want to be seen you
[13:43] know they don't want to be seen the
[13:45] fruits of darkness that they're in so
[13:47] that is the society that we live in now
[13:49] in this day
[13:51] but you see as christians and as and as
[13:54] the people of god we have been freed
[13:56] amen
[13:57] we are free people we we we are free by
[13:59] the holy spirit
[14:01] how many can say you've been freed by
[14:02] the holy spirit the word frees you in
[14:04] this hour amen and the word the word
[14:07] frees your your your thinking in this
[14:10] hour
[14:11] you don't have to think like the world
[14:13] amen you don't have to think what like
[14:17] what they're trying to feed you
[14:19] you don't have to think that way
[14:21] praise the lord jesus
[14:23] you can think the thoughts of god
[14:26] and the thoughts of god are holy pure
[14:29] amen true and just and righteous and
[14:32] will and will uh cause you to behave
[14:35] certain ways
[14:39] you know you you walk down the street or
[14:41] or you're driving down the road
[14:43] and and and and you see the you see
[14:45] people
[14:46] right
[14:48] and the way they they talk the way they
[14:50] they walk the way they they look
[14:53] it tells you what information or what
[14:55] things they think about
[14:58] and what jesus said himself whatsoever
[15:01] you think amen whatever is in a man's
[15:03] heart that is what's going to come out
[15:04] of the pan of the person you see
[15:07] amen praise the lord now in romans
[15:09] chapter 12
[15:10] we read this as well and uh and i'm just
[15:13] kind of reviewing it a little bit and
[15:15] then we'll get to the to the part three
[15:17] part here and he says in romans chapter
[15:20] 12 he says i beseech you therefore
[15:22] brethren
[15:23] by the mercies of god that ye present
[15:25] your bodies a living sacrifice
[15:28] now he says for you to do it
[15:33] he doesn't say that god will present
[15:35] your bodies no he wants you to do it
[15:38] yourself
[15:38] so there's something for you to do in
[15:41] this hour
[15:42] there's a dying out for you to do in
[15:45] this hour
[15:46] that's the reason why bro brother wade
[15:48] and brother dale we've been they've been
[15:49] preaching
[15:50] for years in regards to the stature of
[15:53] perfect man
[15:54] amen that's for you to die out to this
[15:57] to this flesh to this spirit man
[15:59] praise god because these things aren't
[16:01] born again your soul is born again
[16:04] praise the lord your soul is sitting in
[16:05] heavenly places in christ jesus amen you
[16:08] are your soul is redeemed amen but this
[16:11] body still you still have to work on it
[16:14] right
[16:16] amen how many have how many how many can
[16:18] say that every thought that you've had
[16:20] this week until now has been good
[16:22] thoughts
[16:26] nobody can
[16:28] therefore that means that you still have
[16:30] to work on yourself
[16:32] right
[16:33] i can't say the same thing either right
[16:36] we all still working and that's the
[16:38] reason why we are still feeding on this
[16:41] on this word that's helping us
[16:43] now i want you to keep in mind that you
[16:45] can you can understand the stature of a
[16:48] perfect man intellectually but if you
[16:50] don't let those
[16:52] attributes of those things come out amen
[16:55] then it's not anything
[16:56] it's just knowledge
[16:58] and knowledge puffeth up
[17:00] but we want to see knowledge being
[17:02] performed
[17:04] we want to see knowledge amen pass from
[17:07] just being knowledge and and and
[17:09] thoughts to doing
[17:12] amen we want we want to be not just
[17:14] hearers of word but we want to be doers
[17:16] of the word
[17:17] praise god when god spakes his word amen
[17:21] he's it's a thought expressed
[17:24] and it has a man it has those are
[17:26] capsules or containers right
[17:29] of
[17:30] of of his word and those things go out
[17:33] and they're there
[17:34] they got they got a mission
[17:37] they're going to do something
[17:38] they're going to cause some sort of
[17:40] change they're going to they're going to
[17:42] they're going to create something
[17:44] god doesn't speak anything just to speak
[17:46] it
[17:46] he did not create anything that you see
[17:49] created just because it's been created
[17:51] oh they say oh you don't need your
[17:52] appendix
[17:54] god created it
[17:56] it's there for a reason
[17:59] or whatever that part is is it the
[18:00] appendix
[18:02] it's there for a reason
[18:04] god has a purpose
[18:05] for everything that he does
[18:07] amen
[18:08] praise god
[18:10] so paul says here
[18:12] he he wants you to present your body as
[18:14] a living sacrifice you present it holy
[18:17] acceptable unto god which is your
[18:18] reasonable service
[18:20] and he says here in verse 2 and be
[18:22] not conformed to this world
[18:25] in other words don't be molded
[18:28] into this world you see
[18:30] we come into this world and this world
[18:32] has has a mold
[18:34] uh you know a different you know how for
[18:37] example on an ice tray right those are
[18:39] molds where you can place water and the
[18:42] water when you put it in the freezer it
[18:45] freezes up and it and it
[18:47] it forms into whatever the water was in
[18:49] and that shape and so when you take out
[18:52] the ice
[18:53] if it's supposed to be round ice you
[18:55] don't expect it to come out in squares
[18:57] or in cubes right
[18:59] you expect it to come out round because
[19:01] it got molded to what it was and so
[19:04] that's what is paul is trying to say
[19:06] don't mold yourself or don't conform
[19:08] yourself to this world you see the world
[19:11] has all kinds of molds
[19:12] you can look you can look and act and
[19:15] and and talk like anything you just pick
[19:19] you want to look like a rock star you
[19:21] they got it
[19:22] you want to look like somebody you know
[19:24] them anime characters and all that kind
[19:26] of stuff them koreans
[19:28] you know with all the all the the the
[19:30] different
[19:31] uh attire that they wear you can look
[19:34] just like one
[19:35] you wanna you wanna look like a hip-hop
[19:38] rapper you certainly can look like one
[19:40] they're all moles but amen the christian
[19:42] wants to look like christ
[19:44] amen this is the mold that we want to
[19:46] look like amen praise god
[19:49] amen
[19:51] but you have a choice
[19:53] you can pick whatever mold you
[19:55] and look just like that
[19:58] but he says here
[20:00] but be ye transformed
[20:02] so instead of looking conforming
[20:04] yourself to the world instead be ye
[20:07] transformed
[20:09] by the renewing of what
[20:14] he didn't say by the renewing of your
[20:16] soul he didn't say by the renewing of
[20:17] anything else he said by the renewing of
[20:19] your mind
[20:21] because your soul is born again
[20:25] but your body and your spirit is not
[20:28] therefore that's the part that you need
[20:29] to work on
[20:31] that's the part that you still need to
[20:33] be transformed by the renewing of your
[20:35] mind
[20:36] and i and it's interesting that paul
[20:38] uses that word transformed
[20:40] how many know how many have seen when i
[20:42] was younger in the 1980s i watched the
[20:45] cartoon called the transformers brother
[20:48] joe knows about it
[20:50] brother aaron all of them
[20:53] and then later on in the
[20:55] 2000s they made movies with them
[20:59] and so the transformers they were these
[21:01] robots that that supposedly you know
[21:04] there were to be they walked like humans
[21:06] they and they they talked they talked
[21:09] they had robotic voices but they talked
[21:12] and
[21:14] but then all of a sudden when it was
[21:15] time for them to get into war or or or
[21:17] battle or something they they'd form and
[21:20] transform into a car a helicopter or a
[21:23] plane completely different from the
[21:26] original form that they were
[21:28] amen
[21:29] and that's what paul is trying to tell
[21:31] us here amen he's trying to tell us amen
[21:34] that you don't need to be the way you
[21:36] came to this earth
[21:38] amen you can be transformed
[21:42] you can be different by what by the
[21:45] renewing of your mind
[21:48] praise god so how many believe that we
[21:50] need mind renewal
[21:52] amen
[21:53] we all need it i need it
[21:56] because you just told me that you all
[21:58] not all your thoughts were pure thoughts
[22:00] this week
[22:02] therefore we all need that mind renewal
[22:04] all right
[22:06] i like the way that the new living
[22:09] version says it says don't copy the
[22:11] behavior and customs of this world
[22:16] yeah it says but let god transform you
[22:20] into a new person
[22:22] by changing the way you think you see
[22:26] the only way that you will change is by
[22:29] changing the way you think about things
[22:32] right if you see god in a certain way or
[22:35] if you think about god in a certain way
[22:37] that's the way you're that's the way
[22:38] you're gonna head
[22:39] if you're very loose in your life about
[22:41] about serving god that's the way you're
[22:43] gonna act
[22:44] but if you're very tight you know some
[22:47] of us can be overly tight
[22:49] right
[22:51] then that's how you're gonna you're
[22:52] gonna approach god that's the way you're
[22:53] going to look god all right
[22:56] so we were talking about in the last two
[22:58] parts we were talking about that that
[23:00] you know thoughts thoughts how uh
[23:03] thoughts are very important
[23:04] thoughts uh are are
[23:07] we we don't put as much attention on
[23:09] thoughts like the way we should
[23:11] and in reality when you read the word of
[23:13] god when you look at the word of god
[23:16] these are god's thoughts in book form
[23:19] you believe that
[23:21] every single thing that you read here is
[23:23] a thought capsule from god
[23:26] for you
[23:27] and so when you're looking in the in the
[23:29] mirror of the word amen when you stand
[23:31] in the mirror in the mirror every day
[23:33] and you look at yourself
[23:34] you you you're looking at yourself and
[23:37] you're you're you're you're coming to a
[23:39] conclusion about the person that you see
[23:41] in the mirror right
[23:42] i'm too fat oh i gotta lose some weight
[23:45] you know where uh man i don't know
[23:47] what's up what is this that i got down
[23:49] here i got these bags under my skin now
[23:52] under my eyes and i got it i got to do
[23:53] something about that you see we all come
[23:55] to all kinds of conclusions amen but the
[23:58] christian amen when he looks in the word
[24:01] he's supposed to see
[24:02] christ right
[24:05] you're supposed to see and then and then
[24:07] when you look in the word amen and you
[24:10] read what how it's supposed to be or how
[24:12] christ acted amen that that puts in you
[24:15] hey i want to be just like that
[24:18] right
[24:19] in the mirror of the word amen
[24:22] so
[24:23] the word of god transforms our thoughts
[24:26] praise the lord jesus the problem is is
[24:28] that we don't get in the word
[24:30] much that's the problem we don't we
[24:33] don't get in the word much in order for
[24:35] the word to transform the way we think
[24:37] amen
[24:39] amen
[24:40] praise god
[24:42] so we we talked about how uh you know
[24:45] thoughts relate to words and and words
[24:47] they're they're they're highly important
[24:49] how many believe that words are highly
[24:50] important praise god what you'd say or
[24:53] or don't say amen is is very important
[24:57] and a word we know brother brown told us
[24:59] that a word is a thought expressed or or
[25:01] a thought capsule
[25:03] or thought containers amen praise god
[25:06] brother branham tells us he says here
[25:09] you know sunday how we got into it that
[25:11] when god speaks it has to be so there's
[25:13] no way at all to get away from it god
[25:16] says let there be
[25:18] and it has to be
[25:20] the very word itself
[25:23] and the word was a thought
[25:26] right
[25:27] and the word was a thought god when he
[25:29] before a word is an expression of a
[25:32] thought
[25:34] that's why when you're talking to
[25:35] somebody and you're like you know what
[25:38] why'd she say that
[25:40] sometimes you know
[25:44] people
[25:45] show what they're thinking about about
[25:46] what they expressed through their mouths
[25:49] right
[25:50] oh no no i don't think that way but why
[25:52] did you say it then
[25:54] it means it was in your thoughts
[25:56] right
[25:57] because we don't all just just speak
[25:59] just to say things you know we don't
[26:01] just at least you shouldn't
[26:03] right just just blurt out whatever you
[26:06] know brother boyd's talking to me about
[26:08] car cars and i start talking to them
[26:10] about helicopters
[26:11] you know
[26:12] i'm not you know or just whatever you
[26:14] know or just some random thing amen
[26:17] but but but you see that's that's not
[26:19] how we're supposed to approach things
[26:21] amen whatever you thinking amen that's
[26:23] what you're going to express
[26:25] that's what that's what god's thoughts
[26:27] are a word is an expression of a thought
[26:29] god thought in his mind
[26:31] spoke it into existence
[26:34] all right and then here's an example
[26:35] that he gives we read this now if the
[26:37] blood of bulls and goats could give a
[26:39] power to moses to go out there by the
[26:41] commission of god and stretch forth that
[26:44] rod and say let there come flies
[26:46] he had the word of god and he spoke that
[26:49] word
[26:50] and when he did it it become and when he
[26:52] did it become from god's thought a word
[26:56] is a thought expressed
[26:58] right and so then when god thought it
[27:00] and put it in moses's mind and he spoke
[27:03] it it become a word
[27:05] right because god moses couldn't speak
[27:07] anything unless god put it in his mind
[27:09] first to speak it right
[27:11] and i like this part it says and moses
[27:13] turned around and went back maybe not a
[27:15] fly in the country
[27:17] in an hour from then maybe one old green
[27:20] fly began to buzz around in a half hour
[27:22] there was 10 pounds per square yard what
[27:25] was it the creative word of god that was
[27:28] spoke by the lips of a mortal man amen
[27:32] and that is the exact same thing that
[27:33] god wants to do with you
[27:35] he loves it what's the reason why he
[27:37] loves his word and your lips
[27:42] amen and when you confess his word
[27:44] because his word has created power
[27:48] you can change the atmosphere with words
[27:52] about what you say or don't say
[27:56] you can change an atmosphere with
[27:57] silence too
[28:00] amen
[28:02] sometimes we need to practice that more
[28:04] often some of us
[28:08] but words change
[28:10] atmospheres
[28:12] right
[28:12] just as god
[28:14] changes things and creates things
[28:17] when his word goes forth amen you
[28:19] believe that
[28:20] praise the lord jesus how many love the
[28:22] lord
[28:23] amen all right
[28:25] all right let me just skip skip all this
[28:27] here and
[28:29] let's continue here
[28:31] and um
[28:33] and then we talked about examples of bad
[28:35] thoughts turning into action you know
[28:37] amnon raping his own half-sister and
[28:40] when you read it in the life of david
[28:42] how did that happen did amna just wake
[28:44] up one morning and said i'm just gonna
[28:45] rape my sister
[28:47] no
[28:48] it started as a thought
[28:50] that was pr that that that was produced
[28:52] and it was he was just still thinking
[28:54] about it and we couldn't go couldn't let
[28:57] go of it until it finally it came to
[28:58] fruition
[29:01] you see that's how satan came to to
[29:03] to eve the serpent came to eve amen and
[29:06] it was introducing his thoughts to her
[29:09] he didn't you know he didn't tell her
[29:11] come on and just let let's lay with each
[29:13] other no he just he started introducing
[29:15] thoughts
[29:16] all right
[29:17] you know he started introducing little
[29:18] things like while brother burley says
[29:21] that he took her to the chat room yeah
[29:24] and started started just chatting with
[29:27] her just just just talking things you
[29:29] know
[29:30] amen and from there we see the whole
[29:32] thing what happened right it's all
[29:34] starts in little chats
[29:36] that's why young people we need to be
[29:38] careful amen we need to guard ourselves
[29:41] amen
[29:42] about what we how we express ours
[29:45] ourselves uh with each other online
[29:48] you know
[29:51] we we just nowadays is different because
[29:54] uh uh you know i've i've talked with
[29:56] brothers about this back then you know
[29:58] you wanted to talk to a girl you either
[29:59] called her or you wrote her
[30:02] right
[30:03] you wrote her or a letter or you called
[30:06] if you knew the phone number
[30:08] and it would not ring a cell phone it
[30:09] would ring the house phone
[30:11] that means that mom or dad or a sister
[30:14] or brother or somebody or grandma in the
[30:16] house would might be a possibility to
[30:19] just pick up the phone
[30:21] and if they had caller id they didn't
[30:23] know what it who it was but they were
[30:24] going to pick the phone right
[30:27] and then you had to say is is susie
[30:30] there
[30:31] who is this not
[30:33] oh oh it's john uh you know or whoever
[30:36] i'm not saying you know
[30:38] from from school
[30:40] oh okay all right and now the the father
[30:43] could start maybe
[30:44] so how did y'all meet you know or how do
[30:46] you know my daughter you know
[30:48] but nowadays it ain't like that
[30:52] young people got phones
[30:54] and they get to chatting on there it
[30:56] bypasses the the father bypasses the
[30:59] mother bypasses the sister the
[31:01] grandmother they don't know what's going
[31:02] on that's why it's your responsibility
[31:05] as parents to watch those things in your
[31:07] house
[31:09] because you your young people your
[31:11] children ain't going to tell you
[31:14] dang
[31:15] they ain't going to tell you
[31:17] and so it's up to you to guard things
[31:19] like that
[31:21] amen
[31:23] and of course judas is selling jesus out
[31:25] that was another thought
[31:27] that he had
[31:28] that started as a thought and it came
[31:31] into be we know that that had to happen
[31:33] but
[31:34] amen so what is a thought and then the
[31:36] definition of a thought is a
[31:38] something that is a thought such as an
[31:40] individual act or a product of thinking
[31:45] and then it says a developed intention
[31:47] or plan
[31:50] a developed intention or a plan
[31:53] now remember god's word is god's
[31:55] thoughts right
[31:57] that he has an intention or plan with
[31:59] that word
[32:01] and it's to create amen whether it's a
[32:04] physical something physical or whether
[32:06] it's something spiritual in you and me
[32:08] but it's gone it's not gonna go void
[32:10] it's not it's not gonna return to him
[32:12] void it's gonna create and it's gonna do
[32:15] exactly what he said his word to do amen
[32:18] praise the lord that's why sometimes you
[32:20] know we think that that maybe we we
[32:23] didn't we didn't make an effect on
[32:24] someone when we're talking to someone or
[32:27] or even sometimes as preachers you know
[32:28] they're like man that people didn't hear
[32:30] nothing man they just slept the whole
[32:32] time but you sometimes we just think we
[32:34] don't know that maybe a year down the
[32:36] road i remember brother louise talking
[32:37] about that i remember that and then they
[32:40] put two and two together because
[32:41] somebody else gave the extra element to
[32:44] it another preacher or somebody said
[32:46] something
[32:48] and then there it goes amen so so it's
[32:50] almost it's it's hard sometimes but we
[32:53] gotta trust god that god's word doesn't
[32:55] return void
[32:56] amen
[32:58] god's word will not return void
[33:00] so the word that your children heard
[33:04] amen the word that that your family
[33:06] member heard and if they're not here
[33:08] amen that word won't return void
[33:11] and you but you got to believe that you
[33:12] got to stand on that because god's word
[33:15] is god's thoughts and their creative
[33:17] thoughts and then when you put those
[33:19] thoughts in your mind amen then it'll
[33:21] make you a man to be uh connected with
[33:24] that word
[33:25] amen
[33:27] praise god
[33:30] he won't return back void
[33:33] praise the lord jesus
[33:34] it's also reasoning power the power to
[33:37] imagine
[33:39] praise the lord jesus and we talked
[33:40] about
[33:41] how the uh
[33:43] reading in the scripture here
[33:47] let's go back
[33:49] excuse me for just a moment
[33:54] in genesis 6 5
[33:56] genesis 6 5 says and god saw that the
[33:58] wickedness of man was great in the earth
[34:00] and that every every imagination of the
[34:03] thoughts of his heart was only evil
[34:06] continually
[34:08] can you imagine that
[34:10] everywhere that noah
[34:12] you know noah and his family
[34:14] everywhere where they were at all around
[34:16] them
[34:18] all there was was people with
[34:21] every imagination of the thoughts of
[34:23] their heart was only evil continually
[34:26] that's right amen
[34:29] you know we don't live in a society
[34:30] right now that way but it's getting that
[34:32] way where people just constantly you
[34:35] know they're getting to just want to
[34:37] think about continually evil continue
[34:39] evil all kinds of evil i mean hell is
[34:41] just open up
[34:43] it's opening up
[34:45] in different kinds of ways and there's
[34:47] just evil coming at us you know the
[34:50] bible talks about 200 million
[34:52] demons just unleashed upon the bride
[34:56] and so you better be fortified behind
[34:58] the word of god
[34:59] amen
[35:00] so what
[35:01] noah being in this type of situation and
[35:04] him and his family the only ones that
[35:06] didn't have evil continually thinking in
[35:08] their heart that's the reason why god
[35:10] said that i felt noah found grace in the
[35:13] eyes of god
[35:14] can you imagine that wow
[35:17] and in this day god
[35:19] there's a people that's going to find
[35:20] grace in the eyes of god
[35:22] amen even in the late hour that we live
[35:25] in
[35:26] praise god
[35:28] and you better just think that that that
[35:30] that's you amen
[35:32] that that's you praise god when you look
[35:34] at that word there the imagination
[35:37] of thoughts
[35:40] it relates back to the word is the
[35:42] hebrew word yet sir which means to
[35:44] fashion or to frame or to form or
[35:47] fashion it relates to to when a potter
[35:49] is building a a a a vase or or or
[35:53] something he's fashioned in that thing
[35:56] and that's what the people were thinking
[35:57] about fashioning something evil
[36:00] constantly fashioning something making
[36:02] something evil
[36:04] at all times praise god
[36:06] amen
[36:08] all right
[36:09] so there is a little background there
[36:11] and we
[36:12] we we mentioned a few of some some
[36:16] thoughts from god amen that you can
[36:18] cling on amen jeremiah 17 14 amen it
[36:22] says heal me o lord and i will be healed
[36:25] save me and i will be saved for you are
[36:27] the one i praise
[36:29] you know i'd rather be quoting that amen
[36:31] than quoting some some negative thing
[36:33] when i'm sick
[36:35] you have more of a chance to be healed
[36:37] if you quote that
[36:39] amen
[36:43] because god wants you to not just
[36:45] receive the thought and then speak it
[36:48] and when you speak it it has the same
[36:51] creative effect that it had when it came
[36:53] out of god's mind
[36:55] because that's the reason why we're
[36:57] little creators right right we're little
[37:00] creators but we're not little creators
[37:02] by ourselves
[37:03] we have we're only little creators
[37:05] because we we hold on to the word of god
[37:08] through the word
[37:09] amen
[37:11] praise the lord jeremiah 30 17 says but
[37:13] i will restore you
[37:15] to health and heal your wounds declares
[37:18] the lord
[37:19] exodus 23 25 worship the lord your god
[37:22] and his blessing will be on your food
[37:24] and water
[37:25] i will take away sickness from among you
[37:29] isaiah 53 4-5 surely he took our up our
[37:32] pain and bore our suffering
[37:35] yet we consider him punished by god
[37:38] stricken by him and afflicted but he was
[37:40] pierced for our transgressions he was
[37:42] crushed for our iniquities this is a
[37:44] different version but saying the same
[37:46] thing the punishment that brought us
[37:47] peace was on him
[37:49] and by his wounds we are healed
[37:53] praise the lord jesus those are those
[37:55] are god's thoughts
[37:57] amen
[37:58] those are god's thoughts for you
[38:01] in your hour of need
[38:03] amen
[38:05] cling to these thoughts you know about
[38:07] wayward loved ones romans 12 12 says
[38:10] rejoice in hope be patient in
[38:12] tribulation
[38:13] be constant in prayer
[38:16] amen
[38:17] don't be constant and asking why
[38:19] why lord why me why is this happening to
[38:21] us amen be constant in prayer
[38:24] all right
[38:25] romans 8 28 and we know that for those
[38:28] who love god all things
[38:30] work together for good
[38:34] some people say well that's easy for you
[38:35] to say well i'm saying it because the
[38:37] word of god said
[38:39] amen
[38:40] and if the word of god says it it's got
[38:42] creative power behind it
[38:44] for those who are called according to
[38:46] his purpose proverbs 14 26 in the fear
[38:48] of the lord there is strong confidence
[38:52] and his children will have refuge
[38:54] and then psalm 89 4 thy seed will i
[38:57] establish forever and build up thy
[38:59] throne
[39:00] to all generations
[39:03] amen
[39:04] praise the lord jesus
[39:06] all right
[39:08] so now let's let's start here and uh i
[39:10] don't know if i gave this to the
[39:11] brothers or not but in psalms 92 5
[39:15] psalms 92 5
[39:18] he says here david says here oh lord
[39:22] how great are thy works
[39:24] and thy thoughts are very deep
[39:29] amen praise god
[39:31] and thy thoughts are very deep yeah why
[39:33] is david saying mentioning it like this
[39:36] he's putting it that like this is it is
[39:38] it is it that his thought is it that god
[39:40] wants us to have his thoughts that we
[39:43] can't understand
[39:45] no
[39:47] god wants us to understand his thoughts
[39:50] why do you think he gave us his word if
[39:52] he doesn't want us to understand it
[39:54] right he wants us to understand his word
[39:57] praise the lord jesus he wants us to
[39:59] receive the benefits of his creative
[40:01] word his creative thoughts amen praise
[40:04] god but the thing the the thing is is
[40:06] that they're they are deep they're very
[40:08] deep because when you start thinking
[40:10] about just one of god's thoughts
[40:14] just one of god's verse
[40:17] it leads you to
[40:19] a rabbit hole
[40:22] right i mean
[40:25] us as preachers that happens to us we
[40:27] start thinking and looking and breaking
[40:28] down just one verse
[40:30] and it leads us to different avenues and
[40:33] different things amen i'm so thankful
[40:35] for for different resources out there
[40:37] that have
[40:38] you know uh uh
[40:40] you know different
[40:42] different resources that could lead you
[40:43] hey
[40:44] you know you're reading a verse and then
[40:45] you can read a quote that brother brown
[40:47] talked about that verse or vice versa
[40:49] you know just different things like that
[40:51] but you see it can legion you can be on
[40:53] one of god's thoughts for hours
[40:56] and if you really love god and if you
[40:58] really enjoy hearing about god and if
[41:00] you really enjoy his word his thoughts
[41:03] those hours is just nothing for you this
[41:06] is like lord give me more
[41:08] amen
[41:09] praise god
[41:10] give me more so that's what david is
[41:12] saying oh lord how great are thy works
[41:15] and thy thoughts are very deep
[41:19] amen yeah
[41:20] his thoughts are so deep
[41:22] uh
[41:23] and and and and they're they're they're
[41:25] wonderful praise god to us
[41:28] and god gave us the ability to think
[41:30] those same exact thoughts
[41:33] you know
[41:34] the the the animal kingdom doesn't have
[41:37] that ability
[41:39] they don't
[41:41] we are the only species that have the
[41:43] ability to choose what to think
[41:47] right
[41:49] you you can choose what you think well
[41:50] you say well the devil made me think
[41:52] about that no the devil didn't make you
[41:54] don't the devil presented something
[41:55] before you you decide if you want to
[41:57] continue
[41:59] eating on that or thinking on that right
[42:02] as they say you know the bird bill the
[42:04] bird may fly over a man but he doesn't
[42:07] have to build a nest
[42:09] right
[42:10] you just look
[42:11] get the bird out
[42:13] right and the best way to get the the
[42:15] bird out amen is through god's thoughts
[42:18] praise the lord jesus christ amen you're
[42:20] still with me
[42:21] hallelujah
[42:23] amen
[42:25] and so
[42:26] we look at here and when we look at
[42:28] god's thoughts amen you know with
[42:29] regards to understanding the scriptures
[42:31] you know
[42:32] you know we've we've read before we
[42:34] think we think oh my we uh
[42:37] we we read those scriptures and and and
[42:40] we think oh
[42:41] it may not change us right away but you
[42:43] continue chewing on that on that word
[42:46] and you continue taking everything out
[42:48] and and fully getting everything that
[42:51] you can get out from the front from the
[42:52] word of god that's what god wants us to
[42:54] do with his word
[42:55] not just passively look at it praise god
[42:59] praise the lord jesus
[43:02] amen
[43:06] now
[43:07] imagine comprehending the the thought of
[43:09] the word of scripture amen the thought
[43:11] of the thought of god not just not just
[43:13] now
[43:14] but not just now but but but throughout
[43:17] all eternity
[43:19] can you imagine that
[43:21] that same thought in the beginning god
[43:24] created the heaven and the earth
[43:26] that that that that is an eternal
[43:28] thought that you're going to take with
[43:29] you throughout all eternity amen
[43:32] amen
[43:33] the heaven and earth will pass away but
[43:35] god's word will never pass away amen
[43:38] amen so the more we ponder on his
[43:40] thoughts amen the more
[43:42] we we start seeing ourselves in them
[43:44] amen you start seeing yourselves in
[43:46] those thoughts praise god psalm 139 17
[43:49] says how precious
[43:51] also are thy thoughts unto me o god
[43:55] amen do you feel that god's thoughts are
[43:58] precious to you i hope so
[44:01] amen amen how precious also are thy
[44:04] thoughts unto me o god how great is the
[44:06] sum of them
[44:08] and if i should count them they are more
[44:10] in number than the sand when i awake
[44:13] i am still with thee
[44:15] amen you know satan may have bombarded
[44:18] you with a certain thought may have
[44:19] ruined something in your life but if you
[44:21] just take one of god's thoughts
[44:25] what took satan amen 10 20 years to
[44:28] destroy amen god can change it overnight
[44:31] one of god's thoughts can change it
[44:33] overnight
[44:35] amen
[44:36] what took satan amen 30 years to do amen
[44:40] god can do it with his word overnight
[44:44] and we get surprised about it
[44:46] but we know that it can
[44:49] the problem is is that we don't express
[44:51] and we don't practice amen but we don't
[44:54] believe enough our unbelief
[44:57] causes us it leaves us with our mouth
[44:59] open but you should know better
[45:02] that god can do it praise the lord jesus
[45:05] you know we all have different
[45:06] testimonies and different things
[45:08] of how god has changed situations you
[45:11] know
[45:12] praise god and and such
[45:14] in such uh
[45:16] unimaginative ways of of the way we
[45:18] think about it
[45:20] but god's ways are are his ways amen
[45:24] praise the lord
[45:26] second corinthians chapter 10 let's read
[45:28] here in verse 5 it says
[45:31] he says here casting down imaginations
[45:35] imaginations
[45:37] that means imaginations is is not any
[45:41] something real
[45:43] all right it can be or it cannot be but
[45:46] most of the time it's not
[45:48] most of the time us
[45:50] as human beings we worry about things
[45:52] that probably will not happen
[45:55] and you know when those thoughts start
[45:57] coming to you more
[45:59] when you get down to pray
[46:02] how many have had that
[46:06] you start thinking about things that you
[46:08] did not even think about from when from
[46:10] the time that you woke up
[46:14] thinking about the oil change in the car
[46:17] how it needs to get done you start
[46:18] thinking about how you need to go here
[46:20] and then you need to go to the grocery
[46:21] store and and my daughter got piano
[46:24] lesson on thursday and and that's just
[46:27] monday but you're already thinking about
[46:29] the piano lesson on thursday and god's
[46:31] like all right you know you were here
[46:33] with me for about 10 seconds and now
[46:35] you're just diverting yourself
[46:38] i'm still here
[46:40] you're diverting yourself you're
[46:41] thinking about the washing machine how
[46:43] you it needs to get replaced and you're
[46:45] thinking about you know all kinds of
[46:47] things and how you gonna get home you
[46:49] know uh such and such a day and you know
[46:52] you need to pick such and such a person
[46:53] up or whatever it is
[46:57] lately for me it's been picking people
[46:59] up in the airport and things like that
[47:02] going back and forth and
[47:04] you know
[47:06] and you can't er
[47:08] and it's it's hard for a while because
[47:10] our that's when satan really comes in
[47:13] he wants to block you
[47:15] amen from expressing and praying to god
[47:18] amen
[47:19] praise the lord but he says casting down
[47:22] imaginations casting down casting down
[47:25] is not just just laying them down
[47:29] i'll lay down that imagination you know
[47:32] no he says throwing it down
[47:35] he says throwing it out
[47:36] casting it out
[47:38] hey man
[47:40] you don't just lay down the trash you
[47:42] throw the trash out
[47:44] right
[47:45] you throw it in that in that bin and you
[47:48] hurry up and close the lid because that
[47:50] thing stinks
[47:52] right
[47:53] you cast it down that's what paul's
[47:55] saying here in every high thing
[47:58] watch and every high thing that exalteth
[48:01] itself against the knowledge of god
[48:06] now paul didn't say that god would do
[48:08] this for you he's telling us to do it
[48:13] again it's working in this man right
[48:15] here
[48:18] and you can't do it on yours by yourself
[48:20] that's why you need the holy spirit
[48:22] the holy ghost amen
[48:25] will read this word and we'll say yes
[48:27] lord i received that let me start
[48:29] putting it into action
[48:31] god help me
[48:32] because that's my desire my desire fits
[48:34] your desire of your word your creative
[48:36] word your thought
[48:39] now i want to put it to action
[48:41] that exalted itself against the
[48:43] knowledge of god and bringing into
[48:45] captivity every thought every thought
[48:48] to the obedience of christ
[48:51] to the obedience what is the word christ
[48:53] it means is the word anointing amen to
[48:55] the obedience of the anointing
[48:58] amen we as christians we have an
[48:59] anointing on our life right praise god
[49:02] we gotta if we can just keep our
[49:04] thoughts under that anointing
[49:07] it's hard to do but it can be done
[49:10] because paul says so that we can praise
[49:12] god now in first timothy chapter four
[49:15] going a little bit quicker
[49:16] verse 11 it says these things command
[49:18] and teach
[49:20] let no man despise thy youth i'm
[49:22] speaking here to the youth a little bit
[49:24] here
[49:25] but be thou an example of the believers
[49:28] in word in conversation and charity in
[49:31] spirit in faith impurity
[49:34] till i come give attendance to reading
[49:36] exhortation to doctrine
[49:40] he's telling here timothy paul is
[49:42] telling here timothy a young man
[49:44] this is what you should do
[49:48] till i come you give attendance to
[49:50] reading to exhortation to doctrine
[49:54] and i'm sure he wasn't telling him to
[49:55] read his pinterest account or to read
[49:58] his facebook posts or
[50:00] another or his text messages constantly
[50:02] right or his facebook messenger messages
[50:05] that come in
[50:06] right
[50:07] no i'm sure he's talking about the word
[50:10] right
[50:14] watch neglect not the gift that is in
[50:17] thee
[50:19] i want you to understand young people
[50:21] that god has placed gifts in your life
[50:25] and not and not just young people but
[50:26] older ones here as well
[50:28] maybe it might not be a gift to minister
[50:31] or do something in the church but it's
[50:33] it's for something
[50:34] to help someone else
[50:37] right and that makes you a minister
[50:40] because a minister is one that serves
[50:43] so god has called each and every one of
[50:45] us to serve
[50:47] right
[50:48] amen
[50:49] neglect not the gift that is in thee
[50:51] which was given thee by prophecy with
[50:52] the laying of the hands of the
[50:53] presbytery verse 15 meditate and i watch
[50:56] this meditate upon these things
[51:01] upon what
[51:02] upon giving attendance to reading to
[51:04] exhortation to doctrine
[51:06] and give thyself
[51:08] half-heartedly to them
[51:12] doesn't say that no
[51:14] give thyself holy to them
[51:18] watch that thy propheting
[51:20] may appear to all
[51:23] god wants you to profit
[51:27] god wants you to walk like you're a rich
[51:29] man
[51:30] i mean you may not have a dime in your
[51:32] life amen but if you got the word of god
[51:34] amen you are a rich man you're a rich
[51:37] woman you're a rich young man you're a
[51:39] rich young lady
[51:41] praise god
[51:42] amen
[51:43] and people will see that right i think
[51:45] about i think about that testimony that
[51:47] brother branham gives about about blood
[51:48] about the blind man that he prayed for
[51:52] amen and and and he said he's
[51:55] you know he could have god could have
[51:57] given his sight right there and then
[51:58] when he prayed for the man but the man
[52:01] just kept going and he kept repeating i
[52:03] believe he kept he kept saying that i am
[52:05] healed i am healed i'm healed he went to
[52:07] the barbershop and he declared that to
[52:09] everybody he he everybody was seeing
[52:11] that that's why he had profited from
[52:14] amen he's believing amen
[52:17] and eventually it came to pass
[52:20] even though that he was getting negative
[52:22] walls and things were being placed in
[52:25] front of him eventually it came to pass
[52:28] praise god because he stayed
[52:30] wholeheartedly meditating on those
[52:33] things
[52:34] and giving himself holy to them
[52:37] praise god
[52:38] do you think that if you if if you're
[52:40] not constantly looking at something
[52:42] repeating something reading something
[52:45] meditating on something that you don't
[52:46] become that
[52:50] right
[52:52] now that is in now that is for example
[52:54] in the positive
[52:56] now how much more in the negative way
[53:01] whatever you feed on whatever you look
[53:03] upon whatever you think about on amen
[53:06] eventually you become that
[53:10] because
[53:12] a thought can't just stay spiritual
[53:16] right
[53:17] a thought has to express itself
[53:19] physically
[53:21] a thought has to manifest itself
[53:23] physically
[53:25] praise god
[53:27] so that's the reason why
[53:29] we all
[53:30] all of us and and i i'm not speaking to
[53:32] the young people we we have to watch
[53:35] what we listen to
[53:37] we have to watch what we view
[53:40] praise god because let me tell you
[53:42] things the things of this world the
[53:44] things you view the things you you you
[53:46] listen to
[53:48] they mold your thinking
[53:49] amen
[53:51] to think a certain way
[53:53] and to express yourself in a certain way
[53:56] amen do you believe that yes
[53:59] amen
[54:00] amen
[54:02] i can say that for myself
[54:07] my testimony i was an mtv junkie
[54:11] when i came to the united states
[54:14] my mom and dad they had cable
[54:16] of course you know everybody that came
[54:18] to the states back then you think that
[54:20] you needed to have cable and get in debt
[54:23] because that's what that's what you know
[54:25] the people in the third world countries
[54:27] think that here in america you know
[54:28] that's what it's all about you know
[54:31] you make money yeah you make money but
[54:33] but then but then they start getting in
[54:34] debt and you know and now that's just
[54:37] part of life
[54:39] so we had mtv in the house and i was
[54:41] just feeding on that mtv all day long
[54:44] well maybe you might not know what mtv
[54:45] is music television
[54:47] i watched videos and all kinds
[54:49] and whatever i watched whatever those
[54:51] things the music that i'd listened to
[54:54] amen i i wanted to
[54:56] copy those styles
[54:58] amen if if amzie hammer was doing the
[55:00] running man on on television you asked
[55:02] my mom and dad i was there right there
[55:04] in front of the tv doing doing the the
[55:06] running man
[55:07] [Laughter]
[55:10] if you know the name of different
[55:13] artists you know if if axel rose was
[55:15] doing this you know i was right there
[55:17] doing that
[55:20] right
[55:22] and eventually
[55:24] amen that starts hindering you in your
[55:26] life praise god
[55:29] amen so so the music you listen to and
[55:31] and the things you watch amen
[55:35] those things will mold you
[55:37] music that you listen to or fashions
[55:39] that you follow
[55:41] amen they will shape the way you look
[55:44] and feel
[55:46] oh no no i only have those on my
[55:48] pinterest account they're only just pins
[55:50] on my pinterest account
[55:52] then why are you copying them
[55:56] huh
[55:59] praise god all kinds of different things
[56:01] you know
[56:02] here's the problem
[56:04] young people today
[56:07] and you know maybe us during our time
[56:11] we do things
[56:12] and we don't think about where those
[56:14] things come from
[56:16] or in other words the spirit of behind
[56:18] them
[56:19] see we start dressing certain ways or we
[56:21] start looking or talking or saying
[56:23] things certain ways and you don't
[56:25] realize that you know you don't you
[56:28] don't look at where did that come from
[56:30] where is the influence of that from
[56:33] because everything has a certain origin
[56:36] everything has an origin it just didn't
[56:38] just come out out of thin air it comes
[56:41] from someone's thought
[56:43] and there therefore however you you you
[56:46] you dress or however you you talk or
[56:49] however you conduct yourself that is you
[56:52] expressing that person's thought
[56:54] and in reality it's not you expressing
[56:56] your own thoughts it's it's you
[56:58] expressing somebody else's thoughts
[57:02] now i i you know that because because
[57:06] you know yeah i get it you want to you
[57:08] want to look cool and you want to be you
[57:11] know into style or whatever but
[57:13] amen
[57:14] do you want to express your own way or
[57:16] do you want to express somebody else's
[57:18] thoughts
[57:20] because somebody else is somebody else
[57:21] thought of that first
[57:25] let's take a look and see where did that
[57:26] come from
[57:29] where did that come from where did that
[57:30] thought come from
[57:32] can i take it back to the word of god
[57:35] you know from genesis to revelation
[57:38] you know that that that that style or or
[57:41] or that music that i'm listening to can
[57:43] can i see it in the word of god
[57:47] right
[57:49] then it'll help you
[57:51] to choose the things that will mold your
[57:53] thoughts in a spiritual way right
[57:56] praise god
[57:58] praise the lord jesus
[58:01] and you know is
[58:03] it's whatever whatever you whatever you
[58:06] have
[58:07] you know and you say always just pins
[58:09] you know for those who know what
[58:10] pinterest is you know it's just my pins
[58:12] you know i'm not gonna meditate i'm not
[58:14] gonna i'm not gonna act like that but
[58:17] amen there's something in you that would
[58:19] desire that otherwise you wouldn't have
[58:20] pinned it
[58:22] right you pinned it means like you
[58:25] bookmark it you know like you bookmark
[58:27] it maybe i can't do that right now but
[58:30] maybe in the future
[58:33] that's the things
[58:34] get born again and you don't have to
[58:36] look like the world
[58:38] you don't have to be like the world
[58:40] praise god
[58:42] amen
[58:43] i ask you this if jesus was looking
[58:45] through your pinterest account what
[58:46] would he or she think
[58:49] if jesus was looking through your

[1:01:31] it's become a problem not just for young

[1:01:52] are related to pornography

[1:02:15] make you want to pray
[1:02:19] it it's what it's inciting is arousal
[1:02:22] to do something that you you shouldn't
[1:02:24] you shouldn't be doing you know or to go
[1:02:26] out and do something that you shouldn't
[1:02:28] do
[1:02:29] until you get married
[1:02:31] sexual
[1:02:32] behavior in other words
[1:02:35] porn has become a widespread phenomenon
[1:02:38] among young and adult populations as it
[1:02:41] is accessible through all screens
[1:02:45] through all screens
[1:02:46] although more accepted in today's
[1:02:48] culture pornography has led our society
[1:02:51] to over sexualization and gender of
[1:02:55] objectification what does that mean
[1:02:57] in other words men now don't look at
[1:02:59] women the same way
[1:03:02] we look we look at them as objects as
[1:03:05] sex objects if you engage in pornography
[1:03:08] because that's what the porn world will
[1:03:10] make you want to think about women that
[1:03:12] they're just objects to just be used and
[1:03:14] disposed of afterwards
[1:03:17] does is that god's thoughts
[1:03:20] does god want us to think about the
[1:03:22] woman in that way
[1:03:24] but yet
[1:03:25] these sites that is exactly what they
[1:03:27] portray for man to think about women in
[1:03:30] that way or even young girls
[1:03:35] you know there's there was a documentary
[1:03:37] that that i downloaded about two years
[1:03:39] ago
[1:03:40] and it just it brings you know this into
[1:03:42] very it's a very good perspective
[1:03:45] of it
[1:03:47] and and and and it's it's more now
[1:03:49] there's more abuse in pornography now
[1:03:53] where like it's just beating the woman
[1:03:55] and and and things like that it's you
[1:03:57] know just just she's just trash and now
[1:04:00] it's the other way around too
[1:04:03] so it's satan trying to destroy god's
[1:04:06] image
[1:04:10] so that you can get some sort of sexual
[1:04:12] high
[1:04:14] and that is that is that is just a
[1:04:16] perversion
[1:04:19] so often creating addictions and
[1:04:21] dysfunction in real life relationships
[1:04:24] marriages and families the numbers are
[1:04:26] startling
[1:04:28] 47 percent of families report that
[1:04:30] pornography is a problem in their homes
[1:04:34] 47 of families in america
[1:04:38] teenagers who have frequent exposure to
[1:04:40] sexual content are twice as likely to
[1:04:43] experience teen pregnancy
[1:04:49] infidelity increases by 300 percent
[1:04:53] infidelity means that when a man or a
[1:04:56] wife or or husband are cheating on each
[1:04:58] other
[1:04:59] it increases by 300 percent
[1:05:02] when pornography is used
[1:05:04] 68 percent of divorces involve
[1:05:07] pornography
[1:05:08] or obsessive interest in sexual content
[1:05:14] you don't think that those things
[1:05:16] affect your mind affect your thoughts
[1:05:20] why are the why are these things
[1:05:21] happening then
[1:05:22] because remember they have to come to
[1:05:23] the thinking first then they do them
[1:05:29] and then 58 of sex addicts
[1:05:32] suffer financial losses because of their
[1:05:34] addiction
[1:05:37] somebody that's just addicted to that
[1:05:39] and you go to some of these websites and
[1:05:42] and and they charge for it and they know
[1:05:44] that they're going to make money because
[1:05:46] people are willing to pay for that you

[1:10:07] you think people aren't receiving
[1:10:08] thoughts through these sites
[1:10:10] amen they are

[1:10:15] visited the exact same amount that the
[1:10:17] porn site was
[1:10:19] oh my that would be a
[1:10:21] different society
[1:10:22] amen it'd be different
[1:10:25] would you think it'd be different
[1:10:29] it'd be different
[1:10:31] amen
[1:10:32] i'm saying it's no wonder this world is
[1:10:34] falling apart
[1:10:35] if it was falling apart in brother
[1:10:36] branham's time how much more now
[1:10:39] you know technology is good
[1:10:41] the knowledge the internet is is a bite
[1:10:45] off the the tree of knowledge
[1:10:47] amen that's the reason why apple has
[1:10:49] their logo
[1:10:51] you notice that their logo is biting off
[1:10:53] the fruit
[1:10:57] i'm just saying
[1:10:58] well see they're still deceived because
[1:11:00] they think it was an apple
[1:11:04] they're still deceived
[1:11:07] but you can you imagine
[1:11:09] can you imagine
[1:11:11] if if if our thoughts if god if
[1:11:13] everybody's thoughts was was was about
[1:11:15] the word of god
[1:11:18] then you see it back in noah's day they
[1:11:20] say that
[1:11:21] they had technology like we have now
[1:11:23] why was the evil in everybody's hearts
[1:11:26] continually it had to spread a certain
[1:11:28] way
[1:11:30] right
[1:11:31] and internet has become that way of
[1:11:33] spreading things
[1:11:35] but at the same time
[1:11:37] the the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:11:39] evil right is good and evil it's a
[1:11:42] two-edged sword it's a double-edged
[1:11:44] sword so it can be used for good
[1:11:46] but satan
[1:11:48] has turned it amen to be able to to for
[1:11:51] for bad and it's and it's hurt more
[1:11:53] people
[1:11:54] praise god i'm not taking away your
[1:11:56] internet or your devices
[1:11:58] but god
[1:11:59] god is telling us amen you watch how you
[1:12:02] use these things
[1:12:04] right because i believe a holy ghost man
[1:12:07] amen can can overcome those things
[1:12:12] amen
[1:12:14] let me tell you young people you open
[1:12:16] your mind to just one of those images
[1:12:18] one day
[1:12:20] and it will change you
[1:12:23] i know that for a fact i know that
[1:12:26] personally i was introduced to that at
[1:12:29] five six years old
[1:12:32] and it has been something that you have
[1:12:34] to it's a it's a battle
[1:12:37] it's a battle that that god won't god
[1:12:40] god can take it away from you right away
[1:12:42] but it's you have to overcome as paul as
[1:12:46] paul was was telling us
[1:12:48] it's something that you have to overcome
[1:12:51] yourself
[1:12:54] and then if you're not careful you bring
[1:12:56] that into marriage life and it becomes a
[1:12:58] bigger problem
[1:13:01] so
[1:13:02] let us let us watch what we're being
[1:13:04] molded with
[1:13:06] online
[1:13:08] because
[1:13:09] and parents
[1:13:11] put do whatever you need to do
[1:13:14] do whatever you need to do i know that
[1:13:15] when they get to a certain age that's
[1:13:18] between them and god right
[1:13:20] but you when you while you can control
[1:13:22] it do what you need to do don't just
[1:13:24] give free reign to the internet and say
[1:13:26] oh i know my daughter and my my son
[1:13:29] they're gonna pick the right things no
[1:13:30] they won't
[1:13:33] they won't
[1:13:35] no he won't
[1:13:38] yeah
[1:13:40] so you have to be why did brother brown
[1:13:42] say that us
[1:13:44] we have to be their holy ghost up to a
[1:13:45] certain age
[1:13:47] until they get the holy ghost
[1:13:49] and so when you get the holy ghost then
[1:13:50] it gives you power to overcome that tree
[1:13:53] of knowledge of good and evil
[1:13:56] right to keep a balance on it amen
[1:13:59] praise god
[1:14:00] our meditations
[1:14:03] amen should be uh on his word should be
[1:14:06] day and night let's let's finish with
