[7:15] Heavenly Father we thank you for this

[7:34] hearts and our lives we just ask you now
[7:36] that you'd come Among Us and open your
[7:38] word unto us because that's our desire
[7:40] we know that when if we want to see you
[7:42] then the way we see you now is through
[7:44] the revealed word
[7:46] because you're not physically here
[7:47] because we are your body while we're
[7:49] here upon this Earth so Lord we pray
[7:51] that you've got each one remember the
[7:53] sick among us you promised it so we
[7:55] believe it said you would send your word
[7:58] and heal us and we thank you for it we
[8:00] love you and we thank you in Jesus name
[8:02] amen
[8:04] Isaiah 53
[8:07] remember we're reading this because it
[8:09] was the scripture the prophet used on
[8:11] the Masterpiece uh
[8:15] that he was preaching and he said that
[8:17] was a great masterpiece
[8:19] remember now it covers the Jesus Christ
[8:22] and you and I too so we'll get back one
[8:24] of these days to where the Prophet says
[8:26] the bride is smitten
[8:28] from their denominations in the last
[8:30] days so she's smitten also so just
[8:33] remember that okay who has believed our
[8:35] report and to whom is the arm of the
[8:37] Lord revealed
[8:38] for he shall grow up before him as a
[8:41] tender plant and as a root out of dry a
[8:43] dry ground
[8:45] he hath no form nor communication when
[8:47] we shall see him there is no beauty that
[8:50] we should desire him
[8:51] brother said he looked like a piece of
[8:53] hamburger meat beaten up
[8:56] he is despised and rejected of men a Man
[8:58] of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and
[9:01] we hid as it were our faces from him we
[9:04] were despised he was despised in
[9:07] we esteemed him not surely he hath borne
[9:11] our griefs and cured our sorrows yet we
[9:13] did esteem him smitten stricken smitten
[9:16] of God and afflicted
[9:17] but he was wounded for our
[9:19] transgressions he would bruised for our
[9:20] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[9:23] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[9:25] healed oh we like sheep have gone astray
[9:28] we have turned every man to his own way
[9:30] and the Lord had laid on him the
[9:32] iniquity of us all he was oppressed and
[9:36] he was afflicted yet he opened not his
[9:38] mouth he has brought as a lamb to the
[9:40] slaughter
[9:41] and as a sheep before her shearers is
[9:43] done so he opened notices openness not
[9:46] his mouth he was taken from prison and
[9:49] from judgment and who shall declare his
[9:51] generation for he was cut off out of the
[9:54] land of the living for the
[9:55] transgressions of my people was he
[9:57] stricken and he made his grave with the
[9:59] wicked and with the rich in his death
[10:01] because he hath done no violence neither
[10:03] was any deceit in his mouth yet it
[10:06] pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath
[10:07] put him to grief when thou shalt make
[10:10] his soul an offering for sin he shall
[10:13] see his seed and he shall prolong his
[10:16] days in the pleasure of the Lord shall
[10:17] prosper in his hand
[10:19] he shall see the travail of his soul and
[10:22] shall be satisfied
[10:23] by his knowledge shall my righteous
[10:26] servant servant justify many for he
[10:28] shall bear their iniquities therefore
[10:31] will I will I divide him a portion with
[10:34] the great and what and he shall divide
[10:36] the foil with a strong because he hath
[10:40] poured out his soul unto death and he
[10:42] was numbered with the transgressors
[10:44] and bear the sins of many and made
[10:46] intercession for the transgressor right
[10:50] we go over to Romans
[10:52] 11 and we'll begin reading in verse 26
[10:56] 25.
[10:59] for I would not Brethren that you should
[11:01] be ignorant of this mystery lest you
[11:03] should be wise in your own conceits that
[11:06] blindness blindness in part is happened
[11:09] to Israel until the fullness of the
[11:11] Gentiles become in
[11:13] so all Israel shall be saved that is
[11:16] written as it is written there shall
[11:18] come out of Zion to deliver and shall
[11:20] turn away ungodliness from Jacob for
[11:23] this is my Covenant unto them when I
[11:25] shall take away their sins
[11:27] as concerning the gospel they are
[11:30] enemies for your sakes but as touching
[11:33] the election they are beloved for the
[11:37] father's sake what for the gifts and
[11:40] calling of God are without
[11:43] repentance you may be seated Lord had
[11:46] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[11:50] now I've asked you to
[11:53] read or listen to
[11:57] the messages there and the prophet
[11:59] priests on the masterpiece
[12:01] and also seed not air with the shuck
[12:04] and that you would read these and it
[12:08] would help you to understand and then
[12:10] you could say well okay we know that's
[12:12] what is being said like I said I can
[12:14] take a and pull in as bad as I am with
[12:18] typing and things that take me half a
[12:20] day but I can type up some things and it
[12:22] not even be what he says you know but uh
[12:26] you know
[12:28] I want you to read and study yourself
[12:31] and then when I speak on it you know or
[12:34] someone else speaks on it then you'll
[12:36] find out that whether we're talking and
[12:38] telling the truth or not all right
[12:41] now
[12:43] notice the background that Paul is
[12:47] giving I was going to read all of this
[12:49] but we'll just go down through it
[12:52] in Romans 11 he covers the blindness of
[12:55] Israel
[12:58] he covers the the world of mankind or
[13:01] the Gentiles you know as we would say uh
[13:05] when he called it the world uh receiving
[13:08] salvation
[13:10] he covers the
[13:12] um Olive Tree you know the Wild Olive
[13:14] Tree the Jew the the Gentiles and the
[13:17] time Olive Tree being the the Israelites
[13:20] and he covers how the roots of all of
[13:23] this is Jewish
[13:25] and then he gets down in about verse 25
[13:27] as we started reading and he begins to
[13:30] talk about when the fullness of the
[13:32] Gentiles
[13:34] become in all right
[13:37] then he says verse 26 that all Israel
[13:42] will be saved now we know that's not all
[13:43] Israel we know that's fifth seal Jew
[13:45] Israel
[13:47] and the coming in and people come the
[13:49] Jews coming into the Gentile
[13:51] dispensation
[13:54] but then he ends it up in verse 29
[13:57] by saying for the gifts
[14:01] plural
[14:02] and calling singular
[14:06] now he doesn't say we'll do that a lot
[14:08] of times when you notice right around
[14:09] him sometime will say gifts and callings
[14:12] but it's really saying gift and calling
[14:15] because there are many gifts
[14:20] all right
[14:21] but there's really just one calling
[14:24] you know you're either called or not
[14:26] called that's that's just the way it is
[14:27] so it's not many callings
[14:30] you know you may be called to do a lot
[14:33] of things but not calling of the basis
[14:37] of Salvation there's only one salvation
[14:41] on as we'll read in a minute in the
[14:42] scripture but there's many gifts
[14:46] that go into that and now I want you to
[14:49] listen very carefully to the way that
[14:51] I'm trying to bring it and I'll go ahead
[14:54] and say a little bit in the front I want
[14:56] to cover this in the bases of light we
[15:00] did in the
[15:01] um
[15:02] predestination series
[15:05] and looking at it and seeing that it is
[15:09] a
[15:10] it's a great thing to talk about gifts
[15:13] and calling
[15:14] now there's many gifts
[15:17] all right but yet it's so amazing to me
[15:20] as I begin to think about it and and
[15:23] relate to it as how much the the prophet
[15:26] and the Bible would lay is to cover uh
[15:30] the gifts and how what they are and and
[15:33] the things of it and you know and how
[15:36] they work
[15:37] and uh you know so we'll we'll get to
[15:40] that and I really I really enjoyed
[15:42] brother forney's message is our
[15:43] Wednesday he didn't know I was going to
[15:45] speak on uh this you know because I
[15:49] didn't talk to him any about me speaking
[15:51] on the gifts and callings because he was
[15:53] talking about you know the the head
[15:55] being Christ and the and the ministry
[15:58] and the husband and the different things
[16:01] and and I hope you uh enjoyed that
[16:05] but now
[16:06] see what I want us to think about
[16:10] gifts
[16:12] we just say gifts we just say this say
[16:14] that about gifts
[16:16] you know and uh
[16:18] you know seemingly in the message people
[16:21] and I'm saying Lula as well
[16:24] that we have seemed to have laid the uh
[16:28] gifts
[16:29] as one brother preached here one time
[16:31] and I got so tickled his only time I
[16:33] ever heard brother Moe to actually speak
[16:34] out while somebody was speaking and uh
[16:38] he you know a lot of people did brother
[16:41] didn't say this part but a lot of people
[16:42] have preached about the gifts and just
[16:44] light them up on the Shelf you know just
[16:46] throw them away put them up on the Shelf
[16:48] get rid of them and that brother he was
[16:50] preaching along that and he he made the
[16:53] wrong statement he made the statement he
[16:55] said brother Branham said that that the
[16:57] fivefold ministry was just folded up
[16:59] like a piece of paper and laid up on the
[17:01] Shelf
[17:02] well
[17:03] that's all brother Mook could take he he
[17:06] kind of went through the other but when
[17:07] it come to that he said brother that
[17:09] ain't right something to that degree you
[17:11] know and uh just brought out but see we
[17:15] went we have done these things the gifts
[17:18] are here
[17:20] I believe in the gifts in the body of
[17:22] Christ
[17:23] now if we're going to do away with one
[17:26] or say that it's not important
[17:29] then it's just as well as doing away
[17:31] with all of them
[17:32] because there's no little thing in God
[17:34] and the big thing now there are some
[17:36] things that are more important yes
[17:39] and we have the things you know to look
[17:42] at of the prophet in the Bible to
[17:44] understand it sure
[17:46] but still anything of God is very
[17:48] important
[17:50] thing all right then we'll get down and
[17:52] talk to her you know about it see we
[17:55] have the gift of God
[17:57] as we'll read in a second which is what
[17:59] eternal life through Jesus Christ
[18:01] all right now the prophet of God then
[18:04] said it like this one time he said
[18:06] that you know something paraphrasing it
[18:10] that if we're in the body if you have
[18:12] the new birth and in the body of Christ
[18:14] that makes you subject to the nine
[18:16] spiritual gifts
[18:18] you know that's covered in the
[18:19] scriptures all right and he said that
[18:22] that basically you would have one of
[18:24] those gifts
[18:26] working you know as far as in your life
[18:28] if you got the new birth because it it
[18:31] comes even if you say well the new birth
[18:33] it comes forth and it brings us and we
[18:36] come up to knowledge we'll see knowledge
[18:38] be would be one of the gifts that would
[18:41] be the thing that all born-again
[18:43] believers need to have the knowledge of
[18:45] the Holy Ghost and the word of God right
[18:48] and also that would be it but now think
[18:51] about it
[18:53] there's many different types of gifts
[18:58] so if it takes a couple of services
[18:59] today I don't have no problems with with
[19:02] it I want you to understand
[19:05] what you know uh the point I'm getting
[19:08] at
[19:10] the of many different gifts
[19:13] and you just lump them up into a pile
[19:16] and and you've got a problem
[19:19] uh I'll go ahead and say it like this
[19:22] you you have regulations of some gifts
[19:26] qualifications are some gifts
[19:29] you know that you don't have with other
[19:32] gifts
[19:34] you know
[19:35] so then you got to define it but if you
[19:39] don't then you'll just lump it up into
[19:40] one and just gifts and you you know and
[19:42] you want to understand what the Bible is
[19:44] trying to get at but yet then you put
[19:46] too much emphasis on one gift
[19:50] and not look at all the gifts
[19:53] then you'd be going just as bad that
[19:55] away you know to go off and to go to in
[19:57] all right we come up in the age of of
[20:01] Azusa Street which was the restoration
[20:03] of the gifts that didn't mean that it
[20:06] wasn't working before then
[20:08] it didn't mean there wasn't any gifts
[20:11] it was just basically that he had done
[20:13] like I started out saying a moment ago
[20:16] like we are doing it now and I say we
[20:18] which is the right around the world is
[20:21] we've kind of isolated the gifts
[20:25] we don't have them in working in the the
[20:28] local assembly as far as gifts working
[20:31] and I believe in them right
[20:33] right you know but we've got the
[20:34] regulations see that's that's what
[20:36] people are afraid to use the gifts
[20:39] you know they're afraid to speak in
[20:40] tongues and then somebody else interpret
[20:43] because it they're they're afraid that
[20:45] something might go wrong well come on
[20:48] folks every time I get up here
[20:50] I'm on the spot
[20:52] you know what
[20:53] because I'm having to speak to you what
[20:55] I believe God has given me well I'd be
[20:58] glad to be one who spoke in tongues I
[21:01] would be glad to be an interpreter
[21:03] because an interpreter here's in his own
[21:05] language what the one speaking in
[21:06] tongues this is Brother random so we
[21:08] don't have to worry about it and you
[21:10] know every whole church could be
[21:11] speaking in tongues and if I was an
[21:12] interpreter I just sat there
[21:14] until I heard it in my own language
[21:17] everybody else will be hearing it in in
[21:19] their language I mean you know whatever
[21:21] was being said but I would be hearing it
[21:23] in my language all right and see I
[21:26] wouldn't have no problem but see we're
[21:27] we've kind of isolated things and the
[21:31] prophet of God said that a church
[21:33] without the gifts would be responsible
[21:36] and I'm a firm believer in them and I've
[21:39] never never tried to
[21:42] um
[21:43] kill anybody's influence with gifts I
[21:45] had one brother one time that some of
[21:48] them said well boy he was speaking in
[21:49] tongues well I was dumb enough to to be
[21:51] too much to speak I guess and and I said
[21:55] well that may have been true but he was
[21:57] speaking in Spanish
[21:58] he was just worshiping God in Spanish
[22:01] well it hurt his feelings because
[22:04] and what I say about it is is what I
[22:07] mean
[22:07] if if he would have been right he
[22:10] wouldn't have got his feelings hurt
[22:11] but when I brought it out it he was just
[22:13] worse than God in Spanish then he got
[22:16] offended at me well that meant he was
[22:17] wrong
[22:18] that's me I say it you know you know
[22:21] because it wouldn't bother me or none
[22:23] whatsoever but now let's get down to the
[22:26] thoughts of of doing it but as I said
[22:28] now look at all of the background
[22:31] that Paul covers in Romans to come down
[22:35] to say
[22:37] for the gifts and callings of God or
[22:38] without repentance
[22:41] now
[22:42] we'll get to it later you don't repent
[22:44] to get a gift
[22:46] you either have a gift or you don't have
[22:48] a gift
[22:49] right you don't repent to get one okay
[22:53] I would no way in the world tell you
[22:55] that I could go over here and pick up
[22:57] one of these musical instruments and
[22:58] play it because I don't have a gift
[23:01] there's no problem and to remember the
[23:04] prophet said you've been talking about
[23:05] his two girls one day we're listening to
[23:07] tape the other day and he said said
[23:09] there was one of them said I believe it
[23:11] was Rebecca now I'm not sure that one of
[23:13] them was going to learn uh you know play
[23:15] in taking music lessons and he said the
[23:18] other one said it's just come natural
[23:21] he said well if it don't come natural to
[23:23] you he said you're going to have
[23:24] problems because you can learn
[23:27] you know but it's better when it just
[23:30] flows and and everything and uh it'll
[23:34] work because there are gifts
[23:36] of all kind uh when we was in when I was
[23:39] in
[23:41] Brazil the doctor there he's uh yeah
[23:45] what do you call it
[23:47] um
[23:48] skin specialist type of operating
[23:51] but he uh he was the tops you know of
[23:54] doing those he said I can operate and he
[23:56] said I know right wherever nerve is and
[23:58] he said everybody looks at the way I do
[24:00] it you know doing those plastic
[24:01] surgeries he said I can just cut with a
[24:04] knife and never touch those nerves
[24:07] I said brother don't you realize
[24:09] that's a gift well he just broke down
[24:12] crying you know when he was a a real
[24:15] top-notch doctor you know and he just
[24:17] broke down crying he said never thought
[24:19] of that I said use your gift that's a
[24:22] gift from God doctors are gifts this is
[24:25] a gift that's a gift you know and a lot
[24:27] of us have the other one that we don't
[24:29] need a lot of times there's one called
[24:30] gift a Gab
[24:31] but we all have gifts all right but now
[24:35] what I want to talk to you about is
[24:38] is connecting it together
[24:42] with the revealed word
[24:44] all right
[24:46] now we were talking about and we'll get
[24:48] to back into it in a minute
[24:50] in that it's not the person that comes
[24:53] predestinated eternally from God
[24:56] it's the cedar word right 154 Church age
[24:59] book all right see then in doing that
[25:02] then the person is predestinated by
[25:05] foreknowledge
[25:06] because he knew where the gift was going
[25:08] to fall
[25:09] right all right that's fine but the gift
[25:11] itself
[25:13] is not just predestinated by
[25:15] foreknowledge
[25:18] all right and come on you follow my
[25:20] point now and listen the gift itself is
[25:24] the gift of God
[25:25] just like the gift of eternal life
[25:30] you know the new birth
[25:32] all right see then there are gifts
[25:35] that
[25:37] come actually predestinated ordained for
[25:40] ordained
[25:42] of God
[25:45] to be
[25:47] right now the person that it falls in is
[25:50] by foreknowledge
[25:53] that God knows where the gift will fall
[25:54] and what it will be is a person but yet
[25:57] the gift itself
[25:59] is
[26:01] from God
[26:03] now all right
[26:05] she didn't think about it as we we read
[26:07] a few scriptures I don't I'm not going
[26:09] to pull up a lot of it but I want to use
[26:11] the scripture so go ahead with with
[26:13] First Corinthians 12.
[26:16] because I want you to look at these and
[26:18] think about the things that we're trying
[26:21] to make a kind of a little lineup about
[26:22] and to see about it
[26:24] and Paul says in First Corinthians 12
[26:27] verse 4 through 11 now there are
[26:29] diversities which mean different you
[26:31] know
[26:32] um
[26:34] differences in the gifts but the Same
[26:37] Spirit
[26:40] now
[26:41] Same Spirit same God working it all
[26:44] right
[26:45] and there are differences of
[26:47] administration with the same Lord
[26:50] and our diversities of operations but
[26:53] it's the same God which worketh all in
[26:55] all
[26:56] right
[26:58] now but the manifestation of the spirit
[27:00] is given to every man to profit with all
[27:05] right for the one is given by the spirit
[27:07] right the word of wisdom
[27:10] to another
[27:12] the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit
[27:15] all right now again it's all the same
[27:17] Holy Spirit not many different Spirits
[27:20] all right
[27:23] to another Faith by The Same Spirit to
[27:25] another the gifts of healing by The Same
[27:28] Spirit to another the working of
[27:30] Miracles
[27:31] to another prophecy to another
[27:33] Discerning of spirits to another diverse
[27:36] kinds of tongues to another the
[27:39] interpretation of tongues but all these
[27:42] workers that one and self-sane spirit
[27:44] dividing to every man severally as he
[27:49] will all right
[27:52] then it's one God working through many
[27:55] gifts that he gives
[27:58] all right now and as it is
[28:02] don't think that well this is that now
[28:04] the devil can do things I know that I've
[28:06] got it to the last of the message where
[28:08] the devil can pass out Supernatural
[28:10] gifts don't ask me to explain that I
[28:12] can't
[28:15] it's up to you but it's what the prophet
[28:17] had to say about it
[28:19] all right
[28:21] see then he's got his own ministers
[28:25] he's got his own preachers
[28:27] according to the Bible because it calls
[28:29] them angels of light all right now don't
[28:32] ask me to totally try to explain that I
[28:35] just
[28:36] you know
[28:37] because
[28:39] he some way he has a supernatural
[28:41] ability to do things
[28:43] right and maybe if God allows that
[28:46] I know he would have to permit it or you
[28:50] know it couldn't come I know that much
[28:52] all right
[28:53] but think about it now
[28:55] all these worketh
[28:58] by the self-sane spirit dividing to
[29:00] every man severally as he will and the
[29:03] prophet said he said ever born again
[29:05] believer has a gift
[29:08] all right something in your life
[29:10] something connected some way that you
[29:13] can can uh uh you know relate to it okay
[29:17] now we do not believe I've got it on
[29:19] over later we do not believe in laying
[29:21] hands on well I've got scriptures right
[29:23] here or read them we don't believe in
[29:24] laying hands on people for giving them
[29:27] gifts
[29:28] right you know that's Pentecostalism
[29:30] but that's not in the scripture even
[29:32] though you got two scriptures it sounds
[29:34] like that but yet you know let's get to
[29:37] that point all right
[29:39] so go to First Corinthians 13 2 and look
[29:43] at what Paul has to say
[29:45] and though I have the gift of Prophecy
[29:48] and understand all Mysteries and all
[29:50] knowledge and do I have all Faith so I
[29:53] could remove mountains and have not
[29:55] charity and nothing
[29:59] so if you had gifts to be able to work
[30:01] and prophecies and knowing and not born
[30:03] again
[30:05] what good is it
[30:09] and it's possible to do that why
[30:12] because gifts and callings are without
[30:14] repentance you don't repent to get a
[30:17] gift
[30:18] the gift is there
[30:21] in your life
[30:23] I mean you know I used to be I told you
[30:26] about it I used to be to the point that
[30:28] you know that that when I talk to you
[30:30] you know how a lot of people do when you
[30:31] talk to them you ever watch them you
[30:33] know they'll they'll look around and
[30:34] look at them they'll never look an eye
[30:36] you know it's just something that people
[30:38] are that away well I was that away
[30:41] and I reckon one day I figured out hey
[30:43] nobody difference in them they are me so
[30:45] we're all the same just a garbage can
[30:46] I'll just look him in the eye so I'm bad
[30:48] now to look you right straight now when
[30:50] I'm talking to you
[30:51] because of that
[30:53] but forgive me for coughing but
[30:57] even back in my early life
[31:00] I saw what would come later you know
[31:03] after I come later you understand me
[31:06] after I got over here I look back and
[31:09] see okay uh you know and we would would
[31:13] uh we're in a vocational school one time
[31:15] and
[31:16] and uh
[31:18] the guy you know he kind of wanted to uh
[31:23] he wanted everybody involved so he
[31:24] wanted everybody to talk and he divided
[31:26] up you know and he he divided he said
[31:29] okay now we want this group to be right
[31:31] in this group to even be wrong so we
[31:33] know they're wrong
[31:34] that we want to do well they'd always
[31:35] give me the wrong side
[31:37] well sometimes I want people over an
[31:39] argument
[31:40] because it was just dire
[31:43] and then when later when I come into the
[31:45] ministry I saw what it was that that was
[31:47] working dire you know and the ability I
[31:50] had coming down even in schooling that I
[31:54] never brought a book home
[31:56] I never done nothing
[31:58] but I could have made all A's if I
[32:00] wanted to I'm honest I'm not that ain't
[32:02] that smart but I'm just saying it
[32:04] because I paid close attention as to
[32:07] what was being said
[32:09] if you pay close attention in school
[32:12] kids as to what's being said you'll
[32:14] learn more than you will at home reading
[32:16] your book
[32:17] just pay close attention
[32:20] to what is being said
[32:22] get involved in what is being said
[32:24] listen to that teacher attentively to
[32:27] where that they can explain something to
[32:29] you Abby the other day she had some work
[32:32] in my Lord first grade I looked at Anna
[32:35] I said
[32:36] how do you do this
[32:39] greater than lesser than all of a sudden
[32:41] the other they had the alligator you
[32:42] know I'm supposed to eat this one
[32:43] because they tell them little stories so
[32:45] she was adding and I mean she was adding
[32:47] like 27 plus 20 you know
[32:52] and uh you know I had to work it out
[32:55] and I sometimes I said well look here
[32:57] honey how about doing it this way I said
[32:59] take that 27 and put you 20 underneath
[33:01] and they still don't have the carry
[33:03] number over you know because it ain't
[33:04] that far up but yeah she uh
[33:07] when I showed her that she said that's
[33:09] the way the teacher said to do it well
[33:11] see that's that's the way you want to
[33:13] get to going you know is and then you
[33:15] can just add and you know what you got
[33:17] you know
[33:18] all right but see pay close attention
[33:22] to what's being said
[33:23] that's why I ask you to read and pray
[33:26] and study for yourself all right so Paul
[33:29] said even if I have those things like
[33:31] that
[33:33] you know it's still not there
[33:35] the prophet in the message called
[33:37] indictment
[33:40] maybe preaching 63 707 he's bringing he
[33:43] down and he's talking about that we do
[33:46] not believe in the ordaining OR laying
[33:48] on a hand we lay on hands for the
[33:50] ministers and ordaining ministers
[33:54] but he said we don't lay on hands to
[33:57] impart spiritual gifts we do not believe
[34:00] that gifts come by laying on our hands
[34:02] we believe that uh laying on our hands
[34:05] is a sanction to what we've already seen
[34:09] I mean all right so it's not a something
[34:13] you lay on hands to get gifts okay do
[34:16] number do first Timothy 4 14.
[34:19] neglect not the gift that is indeed
[34:22] which was given thee by prophecy
[34:26] with the laying on of the hands of the
[34:28] Presbytery now that looks like it's
[34:30] totally contrary to what he's saying
[34:33] and that's what people will use that
[34:35] they'll use the next one first second
[34:37] Timothy one and eight or one and six
[34:40] wherefore I put in remembrance that thou
[34:42] stir up the gift of God which is in thee
[34:45] by the putting on of my hands
[34:48] all right
[34:49] but yet
[34:51] we don't believe that we don't believe
[34:52] that you can lay hands on somebody to do
[34:54] you remember in the Bible the man that
[34:57] wanted to to have the ability to give
[35:00] eternal life even or whatever salvation
[35:02] you remember in the book of Acts
[35:05] and he wanted to buy it
[35:07] he said can I buy the gift of doing this
[35:10] and see there's many many different
[35:12] things and gifts that work you notice in
[35:14] that one time there was a I can't
[35:16] remember and I get the names messed up
[35:18] so but one time during the book of Acts
[35:20] they were praying for him to get the
[35:21] Holy Ghost and and they prayed for him
[35:23] and the Holy Ghost didn't come on them
[35:25] so they sent for I believe it was Peter
[35:27] and John
[35:28] and they sent for them and they came
[35:31] down and immediately
[35:33] prayed for them and they received the
[35:34] Holy Ghost
[35:36] well see there are gifts
[35:38] and things like that but not just
[35:41] because you put your hands on somebody
[35:46] it's not that away
[35:48] it's not just passing it out
[35:52] you know
[35:53] you're just stirring up the gift
[35:55] that was already there
[35:57] wrote around and said the first thing he
[35:59] remembered was a vision
[36:02] now you man I tell you what I I can only
[36:05] go back about four years old
[36:07] I don't know how dumb y'all are but
[36:08] that's as far as I can go back in my
[36:10] life I can remember about four years old
[36:12] uh chewing my daddy's tuned back and
[36:15] getting sick
[36:17] but uh that's about the first I can
[36:20] remember but he said the first thing he
[36:22] remembered 18 months old was seeing a
[36:23] vision
[36:25] now that's that's a gift
[36:28] all right and so you can remember things
[36:30] in your life
[36:31] that happens
[36:33] that you remember there's something
[36:35] different you know all right yeah but
[36:38] think about it now we don't try to do
[36:40] that we don't try to lay hands on the
[36:41] people to give them gifts because you
[36:43] can't do that but if you see somebody
[36:45] doing you know you see something lay
[36:47] hands on them
[36:49] pray for him to stir up the gift that is
[36:52] in them
[36:54] because you'd have to be God to be able
[36:55] to give the gift
[36:57] no matter what as I said well ago I
[36:58] can't explain how Satan can do it but
[37:00] evidently God has to control that
[37:03] right I mean I do believe that I believe
[37:04] he controls that point
[37:08] but yet
[37:09] see
[37:10] come from God Amen
[37:13] and if you have a gift that's a
[37:14] wonderful thing
[37:17] my wife used to she could sow and then
[37:20] she could just sit down and she just
[37:21] she'd make all work she made me suits
[37:24] she made the kids clothes of all kinds
[37:28] and made Anna all of her clothes
[37:30] well other people
[37:32] I remember Margaret
[37:35] she'd come to Nanny and say well can you
[37:37] sow this you know some people can just
[37:39] do things now tell me to turn a
[37:42] transmission apart and put it back
[37:43] together
[37:45] um we wind up like I did one day when I
[37:47] rebuilt a carburetor my wife came out
[37:49] and you know how you get all these kits
[37:51] and they give you all these gizmos it
[37:52] goes in it but you don't have to have
[37:53] all of them cause it for a different
[37:54] style and so she came out in our
[37:57] carburetor back together and she said
[37:59] what are you doing I said well I'm
[38:00] rebuilding this carburetor she said what
[38:02] about All Imports I said I didn't need
[38:04] it
[38:05] because how would I go and explain to
[38:07] her that just didn't need to be there
[38:08] and that had to be all the things you
[38:09] know but tell me to do something like
[38:11] that you're going to get a transmission
[38:12] Tour Part
[38:14] Richard took a motor apart up in the
[38:16] building one day
[38:17] and I said good luck
[38:21] and he put that thing back together he
[38:22] get them bolts they're just laying
[38:23] everywhere
[38:25] you know surprisingly it run
[38:28] but
[38:29] see there's gifts
[38:32] you sell insurance
[38:34] you know your real estate
[38:37] or whatever
[38:38] some people just can't do it it's just
[38:41] not made for them well that's a
[38:43] difference all of those things are gifts
[38:44] all right now but we want the gifts in
[38:47] the body of Christ and you know and
[38:50] working to help us
[38:52] all right
[38:53] but I want to cover this and then we'll
[38:55] get into to just breaking down some
[38:57] things go to Ephesians brother pull
[38:58] Ephesians there you know where we're
[39:01] going
[39:01] to uh
[39:03] Ephesians 4.
[39:06] go ahead to Ephesians 4. next one
[39:10] because I told them I wasn't trying to
[39:12] quote a lot on some of these things
[39:14] Ephesians 4 18 through 8-13
[39:18] wherefore he saith when he ascended up
[39:20] on high he led captivity captive and
[39:23] gave gifts unto men now watch
[39:27] when you run that little thing around
[39:29] there I'm dumb but when you do that
[39:30] thing around there that means an insert
[39:33] you know something to help explain
[39:36] something to help you to be with so
[39:40] really you can take this scripture and
[39:42] put it right here right and continue
[39:44] thought because see when you talk about
[39:46] gifts unto men now he's talking about
[39:49] how that he's the one that ascended
[39:51] and he was the one that would he also
[39:53] descended you know so he's explaining
[39:55] what Jesus done the one that descended
[39:57] was the one that also ascended and all
[39:59] uh see then you pick up in the verse 11
[40:02] and he gave some Apostles some prophets
[40:06] some evangelists some pastors and
[40:07] teachers
[40:08] for the perfecting of the Saints for the
[40:10] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[40:13] the body of Christ do we all come into
[40:15] the unity of the face and or the
[40:17] knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[40:19] perfect man unto the measure of the
[40:20] stature of the fullness of Christ now
[40:22] he's stipulating there
[40:26] to tell us that there are some gifts
[40:30] that are given for specific things
[40:34] now notice this and I'll repeat it
[40:36] because I know I won't get through this
[40:37] morning but I'll repeat it uh in the
[40:40] gifts you got the fivefold ministry in
[40:43] that faithful Ministry you got a
[40:45] regulation there of the husband and one
[40:47] wife and Etc et cetera Etc all right but
[40:51] now there is no regulations when you
[40:53] come to the nine spiritual gifts
[40:56] true
[40:59] now there's a difference in offices
[41:04] in just
[41:06] regular things
[41:08] all right so that's what we're we're
[41:10] going to get to you know to go on but he
[41:13] gave some who gave it
[41:16] but just remember if it's a gift
[41:19] of knowledge God gave it to you
[41:22] if it's a gift of wisdom or something
[41:24] it's a gift to teach if it's a gift to
[41:27] to play a guitar if it's a gift to to
[41:30] sing see
[41:32] God gave it to you
[41:34] all right
[41:37] you want to be happy about that and use
[41:39] that gift
[41:42] right
[41:43] let me use that you know
[41:46] for for God and let it work
[41:49] in the the ministry
[41:52] now I just want to go scan down too and
[41:54] then we'll pick our thought up
[41:57] repentance don't bring gifts
[42:01] the prophet said in the sign of the
[42:03] answer
[42:04] 62. repentance don't bring gifts he said
[42:08] you're born in this world for some
[42:10] purpose
[42:11] and you don't your repentance don't
[42:13] bring gifts they are predestinated to
[42:17] you
[42:18] all right so now gifts are predestinated
[42:21] to you okay now
[42:25] these are all got the parts in it where
[42:27] the problems say gifts and callers of
[42:29] God the Bible said all right
[42:31] and he says that in the message gifts
[42:34] 1956.
[42:36] that it's something that God by
[42:38] Sovereign Grace put into the church
[42:42] and God does that himself it's a work
[42:46] and an act of God all right
[42:49] a gift in the church is a work and an
[42:52] act of God
[42:53] all right now by foreknowledge he
[42:57] predestinates these things to happen
[42:59] Okay so now no matter what gift you're
[43:02] speaking of
[43:04] remember the person doesn't come
[43:06] predestinated eternally
[43:08] but the gift does
[43:12] the gift does
[43:15] all right now watch the point we're
[43:17] getting to
[43:18] the he said I'm I I'm trying to
[43:22] explain the gifts he said so it's a work
[43:25] or an act of God and by foreknowledge he
[43:28] predestinates these things to be he's
[43:31] not willing and he said perish so we
[43:32] know that he prayed Yesterday by what by
[43:34] his foreknowledge
[43:36] all right but by foreknowledge he knows
[43:38] where the gift will land
[43:41] right
[43:42] but by predestination he's already
[43:45] predetermined it
[43:47] come on are you with me no matter what
[43:49] gift it is he's already predetermined it
[43:52] you don't become a Christian to get a
[43:53] gift
[43:55] you're you're either born with it or you
[43:58] don't have it
[44:00] right and that's just the way it is you
[44:02] you you can practice and play a guitar
[44:05] but it's never as good as the person
[44:07] that can just sit down there with a
[44:09] guitar and and it wasn't
[44:12] and we used to ride to work together and
[44:15] this old man he he was left-handed and
[44:17] the guy that that in his car that day he
[44:20] up and have a guitar and he said get
[44:21] that guitar out let's play it a little
[44:23] well he got the guitar out and turned it
[44:25] upside down little brother uh Bartley he
[44:29] could do that he'd take a bass guitar
[44:30] play it upside down
[44:33] you know and I mean just beautiful you
[44:35] know and I was
[44:38] I can't play it upright or standing or
[44:41] whatever it is you know but that guy
[44:43] could play that thing and that old
[44:44] Feller said make it sound like an organ
[44:46] he could play that guitar and I mean you
[44:48] could hear it just like an organ playing
[44:50] because it was a gift
[44:53] but you know a lot of those people that
[44:54] have gifts don't want to use them
[44:57] right
[44:59] you know a lot of people brother
[45:01] um Lincoln Barner he could play in music
[45:03] and everything but his brother I can't
[45:05] remember his name but he could sit down
[45:07] and he only done it one day and he sat
[45:08] down and he just I mean it was just
[45:10] beautiful
[45:12] I said why don't you play that all the
[45:13] time he didn't want to play
[45:17] you've heard the old story The painter's
[45:19] house
[45:20] needs to be painted mechanics car
[45:24] foreign
[45:27] it's always that way preachers kids the
[45:29] meanest of all
[45:31] you know it's always tied up to
[45:32] something right
[45:34] but now listen
[45:36] God then predestinates the gift
[45:41] to the age
[45:45] Justice now listen I said gift now so
[45:48] I'm remember my point
[45:52] fleshly speaking or speaking you know us
[45:55] the person is not predestinated
[45:58] eternally
[46:00] but the word or seed is so if the person
[46:03] who's not predestinated eternally as to
[46:06] whatever that's by foreknowledge of
[46:08] where the gift Falls but the gift itself
[46:12] is of God
[46:14] and we take those gifts and we turn them
[46:16] around
[46:17] I'll read to you in a little while where
[46:19] the Prophet said we denominate with them
[46:24] because I could take my gift and I'm not
[46:25] no joke I don't worry about it I could
[46:28] sell fried ice cream to an Eskimo
[46:32] because I have a gift when I tell you
[46:34] and I'll sell you something you're going
[46:37] to pay what I tell you you ain't going
[46:39] to get it one penny less but I'm not
[46:41] going to try to get you any higher
[46:43] either man work one time he said you
[46:46] don't do that he said you have to go up
[46:48] and come down I said okay I rate it up
[46:50] 200 dollars
[46:52] but I'm bringing it back down to where
[46:54] it was
[46:56] because see I know what the gift is
[46:59] you know I'll get started and I'll use
[47:02] the gift
[47:04] and and it's just automatic you'll use
[47:07] it
[47:08] and you can deal with people and things
[47:10] you know like brother marker said they
[47:14] make millions buying cars he says I have
[47:17] trouble selling them
[47:21] it's a gift
[47:23] you know all right
[47:25] but see just like the word is
[47:27] predestinated for the age proving his
[47:29] word
[47:30] me
[47:31] the gifts and callings of God are
[47:34] predestinated to the ages and times
[47:38] and it's dire because it will be there
[47:41] because God foreordained it to be
[47:43] amen that's why you have it see that uh
[47:48] now Luther spoke in tongues according to
[47:51] his own record
[47:52] entire
[47:54] it wasn't that no gifts was working
[47:57] until Azusa Street in the Pentecostals
[47:59] came the gifts were working but they
[48:01] were kind of like I said now they were
[48:03] kind of just pushed down until they were
[48:05] not being used but then the spirit was
[48:07] loose of the gifts
[48:09] to come into order and yazusa Street the
[48:12] Pentecostal see started with the gifts
[48:15] all right and that's why it's called
[48:17] that age of the gifts but remember then
[48:19] it was predestinated to be that he
[48:21] wasn't predestinated of God to be in
[48:23] Luther's age
[48:26] because that's the restoration that
[48:28] we'll get back to later you know that's
[48:30] the restoration that was coming down all
[48:32] right but think about it now
[48:38] it was predestinated
[48:43] now are you gonna follow this one
[48:48] Adam
[48:52] was the word right
[48:56] will you go women there Adam was your
[48:57] word
[48:59] God made him
[49:01] and you know what he was predestinated
[49:03] eternally
[49:07] and uh don't tell me don't don't try to
[49:09] play games with me by well they fail
[49:11] that wasn't in God's predestination we
[49:14] ain't talking about that so that's where
[49:15] you're losing the game
[49:17] the man Adam had no choice
[49:21] he was created
[49:24] like that I'm trying to illustrate it
[49:26] Eve Adam had no choice of accepting a
[49:29] wife or not
[49:31] she was taken from him
[49:34] so that went that meant that that was
[49:36] going to happen
[49:39] you know and there was no way to change
[49:41] that from happening because it was
[49:43] predestinated to happen
[49:48] the same as the Lord Jesus was a
[49:52] predestinated Eternal person now that
[49:54] didn't make his body Eternal I didn't
[49:55] say that
[49:56] that was made Eternal in the
[49:58] resurrection but he was predestinated
[50:00] eternally
[50:03] you agree with that why because he was
[50:05] the word
[50:07] when you're dealing with the word saying
[50:09] something
[50:11] that's why I said that about this
[50:12] sitting there in the scripture Ephesians
[50:14] 4 see
[50:15] that's predestinated what there's going
[50:18] to be a faithful Ministry
[50:20] irregardless of what we think about it
[50:23] all right
[50:25] see there was going to be a Jesus Christ
[50:28] there was going to be the seat of the
[50:30] woman that would come
[50:33] because he was a predestinated person
[50:37] it wasn't something that that was done
[50:40] by foreknowledge to decide
[50:45] right right
[50:46] it wasn't that man fell and then he was
[50:49] four knowledge well okay I got to do
[50:51] something about it
[50:53] no
[50:55] he was the word
[50:57] so he was predestinated
[51:00] a predestinated person
[51:02] because he was almighty God
[51:05] all right
[51:06] and see then in doing that then you're
[51:08] not dealing
[51:10] with just the desires of anybody
[51:13] when you're talking about predestination
[51:15] I told you I wasn't through with
[51:16] predestination in that form I just
[51:18] getting it down to the bases that we
[51:20] could understand
[51:22] all right
[51:23] see Jesus Christ was predestinated for
[51:26] ordained
[51:29] now when you're dealing with
[51:30] predestination you're dealing with it by
[51:32] foreknowledge right
[51:34] God for new all right you keep that in
[51:37] line but when you get to the word for
[51:39] ordained or ordained
[51:43] that means it's determined
[51:47] that means it's going to happen
[51:51] all right see all of that on
[51:53] predestination was just a background
[51:55] for you to and me to understand
[51:57] something when you're dealing with
[51:58] something that's foreordained
[52:01] all right
[52:02] look what he says Jehovah Jireh 1961.
[52:06] now see gifts and callings are without
[52:08] repentance Jesus couldn't help being the
[52:11] son of God
[52:15] he was the son of God for ordained
[52:19] predestinated before the foundation of
[52:22] the world and even slain before the
[52:24] foundation of the world
[52:28] all right
[52:30] now he can use gifts and callings or
[52:32] speaking as to Jesus Christ
[52:36] and who he would be he said gifts and
[52:39] callings are without repentance you
[52:42] absolutely received them when you're
[52:44] born in this world
[52:46] as Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[52:48] and forever 1952
[52:51] the Bible says that how many Believers
[52:53] believe in predestination for Nation
[52:56] election all right Christ was the son of
[52:59] God from the foundation of the world he
[53:01] was a lamb slain from the foundation
[53:03] world you believe that he was the
[53:05] woman's seed that was to bruise the
[53:07] Serpent's head you believe that then he
[53:10] was predestinated for ordained of God
[53:14] do you believe that he said
[53:17] do you believe Jesus was foreordained
[53:20] not a choice that he had
[53:23] it was a predetermined Factor right
[53:27] right why because he's the word
[53:29] now when you're dealing with the word
[53:31] remember it's a word that's
[53:33] predestinated eternally
[53:37] it's the word that's predestinated
[53:39] eternally but Jesus Christ was not so in
[53:41] the basis of having to have a
[53:43] foreknowledge sure by foreknowledge he
[53:45] knew what he would do and that he would
[53:47] die right but remember the he that for
[53:50] ordained it was the he that died
[53:55] order
[53:59] you're not dealing with him looking at
[54:01] something to happen and thinking about
[54:03] it
[54:05] mm-hmm
[54:06] he never thought about coming to the
[54:08] world and dying
[54:10] he knew that's what he was going to do
[54:15] remember the one we're talking about
[54:19] the Son of God had no choice
[54:27] he didn't choose to do that
[54:30] he would foreordained that he do that
[54:34] all right let's get that straight
[54:36] because we cover we'll get that this
[54:37] morning's nothing else let's get it
[54:39] right about a gift
[54:43] and a gift coming from God
[54:49] now what you do with it is don't deal
[54:51] with me on that don't play games with me
[54:52] on your mind with it and say yeah but we
[54:54] can do this we can do it that's you
[54:58] I can take my gift and sell for ice
[55:00] cream to an Eskimo yeah but that's not
[55:03] God trying to sell ice cream to an
[55:05] Eskimo he didn't give it to me for that
[55:07] reason
[55:09] he gave it to me to try to bring the
[55:11] word
[55:13] yeah
[55:14] all right
[55:16] now see then when we look at it we can
[55:19] see that lamb
[55:21] with almighty God
[55:24] he never decided to be a lamb
[55:27] right he never had a choice of being a
[55:29] lamb
[55:33] it was predetermined the prophet says go
[55:36] to Christ the minister God's reveal and
[55:38] see that if God didn't have a plan and a
[55:40] purpose that he was going to achieve not
[55:46] maybe he would or hoped he would
[55:49] he said to let himself be expressed
[55:55] right so then we're dealing we're
[55:56] dealing with God the gift of eternal
[55:58] life
[56:00] that eternal life you receive in the New
[56:02] Birth he's almighty God
[56:06] it comes predestinated eternally
[56:11] but you and I where it falls is by his
[56:14] foreknowledge
[56:16] that he knows where to fall
[56:19] but not so with God
[56:22] come on
[56:23] you see why as I said it'll take me a
[56:25] while to preach it because you get it
[56:27] all mingled up in your mind and try to
[56:29] understand just remember you and I are
[56:32] not God
[56:34] the prophets were not God
[56:37] they were used of God and in being used
[56:41] they came so close until he could say
[56:43] that he was God to the people
[56:48] but yet when he stepped back he's Moses
[56:51] right
[56:52] he was gone to the people when he stood
[56:54] there and smoked a rock and water came
[56:56] out to feed up in the water all those
[56:57] two and a half million people in her
[56:59] cattle and everything
[57:00] I never didn't understand that I still
[57:02] don't understand how that River run all
[57:03] the way through because the Bible says
[57:05] it followed him
[57:08] where did it go now
[57:11] there ain't no record of it being no
[57:13] great big Rivers running down through
[57:14] there
[57:16] it evidently went out of existence
[57:18] I don't understand all that I just
[57:20] understand and believe it
[57:22] but now look while he was saying that he
[57:25] was told to Smite The Rock
[57:27] right
[57:28] that was the word of God
[57:31] but when Moses smote it the second time
[57:34] because of it and getting upset with the
[57:36] people
[57:37] that was not of God
[57:39] that set up a denomination your Prophet
[57:41] said
[57:44] and that meant Jesus Christ would have
[57:45] to be smitten again in the end time
[57:48] in this day
[57:51] right
[57:54] you see what I'm talking about but Jesus
[57:56] Christ himself
[57:58] was almighty God
[58:00] you know I I try to make it so strong
[58:02] where you said he didn't come
[58:04] predestinated he worked the
[58:05] predestinator
[58:09] he didn't come by foreknowledge he was
[58:12] before knowledge
[58:16] he was the gift of God
[58:18] because that's the only way to have
[58:20] eternal life
[58:22] that's why I don't agree with people
[58:23] that believe the Old Testament people
[58:24] have eternal life and this that and the
[58:26] other about it no
[58:28] because Jesus Christ is eternal life and
[58:30] he had to die to release that life
[58:33] for it to come they had the anointings
[58:35] for the hour and they had to wait until
[58:37] he came
[58:41] that's why they had to raise with him
[58:44] why because they were waiting on him
[58:48] but remember the gift of God is eternal
[58:51] life through Jesus Christ
[58:54] predestinated
[58:57] for ordained
[59:00] of God
[59:05] I believe that gifts and callings as I
[59:07] said are without repentance that you're
[59:09] born here in the world with these gifts
[59:11] this is taken from gifts and callings or
[59:13] without repentance in 1950. just the
[59:16] same as you're born to be a musician
[59:18] you might give your child give it all
[59:20] kind of lessons but if that musical
[59:23] Talent isn't in it it'll never do no
[59:26] more good is that right but we're born
[59:29] the same way into spiritual Realms
[59:32] listen for gifts and callings of God or
[59:35] without repentance that you might know
[59:37] Jesus Christ was foreordained of God
[59:42] he was the one was seen from the Garden
[59:45] of Eden he said Do you believe it
[59:49] Jesus Christ was for ordained of God
[59:51] because he was God
[59:55] can you get that
[59:58] he was the one that done the
[1:00:00] forordaining
[1:00:03] but him and himself coming it wasn't a
[1:00:05] choice right
[1:00:07] right but around said when man fell in
[1:00:08] the garden God knew he had to do
[1:00:12] something
[1:00:13] and said he came himself
[1:00:17] he didn't send a son to die he came
[1:00:20] himself
[1:00:22] that's why Jesus would say unless you
[1:00:24] believe that I am he you'll die in your
[1:00:25] sins
[1:00:27] all right
[1:00:28] he was predestinated eternally
[1:00:32] to come and be here and be the word
[1:00:35] all right
[1:00:37] turn it all the way back to where we
[1:00:38] were at all right watch now
[1:00:41] led by the spirit 19 in 52.
[1:00:45] now I was born by a gift these gifts
[1:00:48] don't come by laying on our hands those
[1:00:51] gifts come by the sovereignty of God
[1:00:56] all right
[1:00:57] gifts and callings are without
[1:00:59] repentance they was foreordained of God
[1:01:03] to be gifts are born
[1:01:06] Jesus Christ in the garden he was the
[1:01:08] woman's seed that would bruise the
[1:01:10] Serpent's heel
[1:01:13] who was he
[1:01:17] he was the word
[1:01:19] he was the word
[1:01:21] that would come predestinated
[1:01:25] eternally
[1:01:26] all right
[1:01:28] that's why when we tie together the
[1:01:30] thoughts of predestination back into
[1:01:33] what we're talking about in the way we
[1:01:35] brought it down
[1:01:39] then surely God did use a man named
[1:01:41] Moses
[1:01:45] but remember Moses picked up the thought
[1:01:48] of God
[1:01:49] it wasn't his fault
[1:01:53] he picked up the thought of God and
[1:01:56] spoke it and it become word
[1:01:58] right
[1:02:00] because he himself as a person
[1:02:04] was not predestinated
[1:02:06] eternally
[1:02:08] now God knew where it would fall come on
[1:02:11] what do you need but how are you going
[1:02:12] to make it if he's predestinated
[1:02:14] eternally he's God
[1:02:17] how did you get it
[1:02:21] he said well I'm predestinated brother
[1:02:22] there then you're God if you're going
[1:02:24] that away
[1:02:26] but if you're lost and doomed and on the
[1:02:28] way to hell and realize you need to be
[1:02:30] saved and get saved then that inside of
[1:02:33] you right
[1:02:36] is just as Eternal as God is what kind
[1:02:38] of because it's God's own life
[1:02:40] it's not just as Eternal because he gave
[1:02:42] you something
[1:02:45] see I'm a firm believer in
[1:02:47] predestination folks
[1:02:48] but I'm a firm believer in foreknowledge
[1:02:50] to keep it straight
[1:02:54] but I will say this to you that I didn't
[1:02:56] put into that series that one day I'll
[1:02:58] get back to it
[1:03:00] that word
[1:03:03] before the world
[1:03:05] was predestinated eternally
[1:03:11] come on
[1:03:13] the person that fell into fails in
[1:03:15] foreknowledge
[1:03:18] that's why we are The Offspring of God
[1:03:21] that's my brother Brandon when he gets
[1:03:23] down to the last message he preaches the
[1:03:24] communion he said I found out I wasn't a
[1:03:26] son of Charles and Ella Branham he'd
[1:03:28] been thrown off when it was Mom and
[1:03:29] Daddy come on what was he saying he said
[1:03:32] I found out I always was a child of God
[1:03:35] what the eternal life that was in him
[1:03:38] the body wasn't because it died and went
[1:03:40] in the grave right
[1:03:41] so he certainly wasn't talking about the
[1:03:43] physical side
[1:03:45] you were talking about something inside
[1:03:47] of him
[1:03:49] and if that Eternal God could choose to
[1:03:52] come down to you and I
[1:03:56] and give his life that we could receive
[1:03:58] that life why don't we accept it and say
[1:04:01] thank you Lord
[1:04:04] and say Lord then now whatever you want
[1:04:07] done you take care of it
[1:04:10] wow
[1:04:12] see because then
[1:04:14] as the prophets
[1:04:18] those prophets come predestinated
[1:04:22] now listen to my point I won't spend but
[1:04:24] a minute my background this in this
[1:04:25] evening
[1:04:27] those Prophets the message they brought
[1:04:31] which is the word of God you agree
[1:04:34] remember masterpiece
[1:04:37] Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph laid the
[1:04:40] foundation you know the patriarch but
[1:04:43] the prophets built the body you remember
[1:04:44] that all right see then without those
[1:04:47] prophets that body would have not come
[1:04:49] into being
[1:04:52] right take out one of even the Minor
[1:04:54] Prophets anything take it out they
[1:04:55] wouldn't come into being
[1:04:56] why because it would not be a complete
[1:04:58] body those prophets built the body can't
[1:05:02] you just see as it was coming down all
[1:05:04] of those prophets and them saying Isaiah
[1:05:06] stand there one day and say a virgin
[1:05:07] shall conceive
[1:05:10] you know that meant somewhere there's
[1:05:11] going to have to be a virgin right to
[1:05:13] conceive
[1:05:15] when Naaman would say cherished Johnson
[1:05:16] in the streets running like lightning it
[1:05:18] would mean they would be one day that
[1:05:19] Buicks Oldsmobiles and Cadillacs will be
[1:05:21] run up down the highway with lights on
[1:05:23] because that's what he saw
[1:05:26] and he just spoke what he saw
[1:05:29] that never made him God
[1:05:32] but it made the message he brought
[1:05:37] right the word he brought was God
[1:05:40] himself
[1:05:41] he just used a man
[1:05:43] why because you remembering the story
[1:05:45] there in the Bible when they come out
[1:05:48] God was bringing them out
[1:05:52] he sent Moses down to do it sure but he
[1:05:54] wanted to be God to all the people
[1:05:57] he brought them to that burning
[1:05:59] Mountain
[1:06:02] and when I heard the Thunders and the
[1:06:04] Lightnings and things they said don't
[1:06:05] let God speak no more
[1:06:07] said Moses you go up and find out and
[1:06:10] you come back and tell us
[1:06:12] well Moses went up early he didn't go up
[1:06:14] there and said now Lord I want to
[1:06:16] explain to you they don't want to listen
[1:06:17] to you they want to listen to God and
[1:06:19] you when he got up there
[1:06:20] there's no statements in there that
[1:06:22] Moses explained it to God
[1:06:25] when he got up there God said I know
[1:06:27] what they're doing just like he said to
[1:06:29] Samuel he said they have not rejected
[1:06:31] you Samuel
[1:06:33] right he said they have rejected me
[1:06:36] you don't have to explain to God all of
[1:06:39] the things we spent half of our prayers
[1:06:41] a lot of time explaining something to
[1:06:42] him
[1:06:44] Lord you know I've been having problems
[1:06:46] I've been having troubles
[1:06:49] get out of business
[1:06:52] tell him what's wrong with you and what
[1:06:54] you believed he already
[1:06:55] Bible said he would for us to pray
[1:06:59] but see those Prophets
[1:07:01] born in the specific times
[1:07:05] for each one of them to be able to bring
[1:07:07] forth the word for the day that they
[1:07:09] were living and the word they brought
[1:07:12] was almighty God
[1:07:17] right
[1:07:18] that's why he could say Jeremiah which
[1:07:21] one of them he said I knew you before
[1:07:22] the world ordained you
[1:07:25] did he ordain the flesh
[1:07:27] that's my foreknowledge
[1:07:31] but he ordained the son of man right
[1:07:35] remember those prophets were a son of
[1:07:36] man
[1:07:38] speaking of the son of man which would
[1:07:40] be the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:42] all right
[1:07:44] but as their message was going forth you
[1:07:46] know what that message was the son of
[1:07:48] man that's why you can't separate them
[1:07:52] and those prophets come what
[1:07:55] gifts and callings are without
[1:07:57] repentance
[1:08:01] you believe in Ford Nation
[1:08:04] Moses was ordained of God for ordained
[1:08:08] when he was born
[1:08:10] and he would found a proper child
[1:08:12] John the Baptist 74 12 year
[1:08:16] before he was born he's a voice of one
[1:08:18] crying in the wilderness Jeremiah I
[1:08:21] believe it was God said before you was
[1:08:22] ever even born and for you was formed in
[1:08:26] your mother's womb I knew you and
[1:08:27] Sanctified you and ordained your Prophet
[1:08:29] over the Nations before you were born
[1:08:34] no
[1:08:36] can you separate
[1:08:40] so I said I back up on this again this
[1:08:42] evening but can you separate
[1:08:45] the gift
[1:08:46] from the person
[1:08:51] see that's where the trouble was we
[1:08:53] brought around him they couldn't do that
[1:08:56] they said he was almighty God
[1:08:58] and with all the signs and wonders was
[1:09:00] in his ministry no wonder
[1:09:06] they thought John was a great thing back
[1:09:08] there right
[1:09:09] you know John never done one miracle
[1:09:11] not whatsoever
[1:09:14] and yet they thought he was Elijah or
[1:09:16] none of this or whatever
[1:09:19] but do you understand
[1:09:22] God gives gifts
[1:09:28] God supplies the gifts
[1:09:33] you and I just enjoy the gift
[1:09:36] right but the main thing is the gift of
[1:09:39] God which is eternal life and that's
[1:09:41] predestinated eternally
[1:09:45] now the human flesh that was here that
[1:09:48] we're living in
[1:09:49] is by foreknowledge of God because he
[1:09:51] looks through and sees that
[1:09:54] that's right but he knows right where
[1:09:56] that gift is going to land you say well
[1:09:57] well brother Dale then that don't give
[1:09:59] me no hopes it don't if you don't want
[1:10:01] any
[1:10:02] come on
[1:10:04] don't play games
[1:10:06] if you don't believe you can be saved
[1:10:08] you know what you can't be
[1:10:09] God ain't gonna override you three more
[1:10:12] ages and make it get saved
[1:10:14] but if you believe it
[1:10:16] he can work then
[1:10:20] because he can give you the gift of
[1:10:21] eternal life his own life
[1:10:25] then can't you see him standing in those
[1:10:28] Prophets
[1:10:32] come on didn't he tell Moses
[1:10:35] he said Moses go down there
[1:10:37] and Moses said now who am I going to
[1:10:39] tell them
[1:10:40] he said tell him I am
[1:10:43] well that's pretty close from Moses
[1:10:44] wouldn't it
[1:10:45] if I Pharaoh what did I hear Moses say
[1:10:48] Moses is going to tell me he said I am
[1:10:51] yeah right that's what he said
[1:10:55] but Moses knew better
[1:10:57] than to think he was the one that was
[1:10:59] going to deliver them right
[1:11:01] but he knew if the I am was with him
[1:11:06] right amen
[1:11:10] so he'd go out you know he had Aaron
[1:11:12] speak a lot of times but to be flies he
[1:11:14] just go by
[1:11:17] and I don't flies no more nothing
[1:11:23] remember the snake story
[1:11:26] wrote it down
[1:11:28] stick and it become a snake
[1:11:32] The Magicians they just throw dirt down
[1:11:33] to become snakes too
[1:11:41] that's where our trouble is we get it
[1:11:43] all messed up by trying to figure out
[1:11:44] what God's doing trying to help him
[1:11:47] instead of relaxing
[1:11:52] this relaxing that God
[1:11:56] why because what is he going to do
[1:12:00] I told you before I've never come to
[1:12:02] church I have come to this church
[1:12:04] without an ordained line of which I was
[1:12:07] going to preach on
[1:12:10] but yet I don't worry about it
[1:12:14] I'm not concerned about it
[1:12:17] a lot of people and I know in the early
[1:12:19] Ministry when I first started if I was
[1:12:21] going to preach three weeks later I was
[1:12:22] already had everything done the first
[1:12:24] day
[1:12:25] and I was biting my fingernails and
[1:12:26] worrying about it till I got there
[1:12:29] within one day something happened and I
[1:12:30] said well
[1:12:31] Lord if it's you okay if it ain't you
[1:12:34] that's me anyway so get me out of the
[1:12:35] way so I'll just go to church and say
[1:12:37] come on
[1:12:40] I don't brag I just try to tell the
[1:12:42] truth I told them in the Bible study
[1:12:45] someone said let's just pick scriptures
[1:12:47] and and brother Dale you just sat down
[1:12:49] and start on that scripture you know
[1:12:51] Romans 1 and just start and read and
[1:12:52] explain it
[1:12:54] I said I'll make you a better deal
[1:12:56] I said let's don't plan those scriptures
[1:13:00] I said let's just wait to come to the
[1:13:02] Bible study
[1:13:06] because see I'd figure it all out
[1:13:08] I'd have it all explained brother I said
[1:13:10] look I said this is heaven
[1:13:12] no I trust a gift
[1:13:16] so come on we'll just come to Bible
[1:13:18] study and we'll just sit down take
[1:13:19] whatever scripture you want to talk
[1:13:20] about because if I don't know what it is
[1:13:22] I don't mind telling you I don't know
[1:13:23] what it is
[1:13:25] yeah
[1:13:27] but see a gift is a gift
[1:13:30] if you can trust it right
[1:13:34] but now let me say a little more and
[1:13:36] then get on to this this afternoon gifts
[1:13:39] don't save you
[1:13:42] gifts don't heal you
[1:13:45] run around with this here
[1:13:50] what are you depending on
[1:13:54] his gift
[1:13:55] s don't save you
[1:13:58] gifts don't heal you
[1:14:01] well now I just don't understand that
[1:14:02] brother I believe it does well then why
[1:14:04] would he go for months and months and
[1:14:06] months with his wife when that growth
[1:14:09] was in her side getting bigger and
[1:14:11] bigger and bigger
[1:14:13] if it's just like you lay it out to be
[1:14:15] that he just to do anything
[1:14:18] why didn't he speak to that
[1:14:20] don't you think he prayed for her
[1:14:23] every day
[1:14:27] I've had many a time my wife would be
[1:14:29] sick I'd lay over in the bed and just
[1:14:31] reach over and lay my hand on say the
[1:14:32] Lord
[1:14:33] take that thing away in Jesus name
[1:14:36] never say a word to her
[1:14:39] a few days later say you feeling better
[1:14:40] honey
[1:14:41] yeah
[1:14:44] that's well I could have told you
[1:14:47] I could have told you but
[1:14:49] there was no need of it because it
[1:14:51] already finished
[1:14:53] Zach sitting back there
[1:14:54] when he was born he had what I call
[1:14:56] yellow jaunders or what they call all
[1:14:57] those things or the factors in him
[1:14:59] they'd had to put him under lights and
[1:15:00] do things and I was down in the woods
[1:15:02] you've heard me tell it I was down in
[1:15:03] the woods deer hunting
[1:15:05] they called me and said Zach's real sick
[1:15:08] come on home
[1:15:10] I went and prayed
[1:15:14] I called my wife I said
[1:15:18] his act's all right
[1:15:20] she said yeah but said
[1:15:22] I think the kids need you I said do you
[1:15:25] think it helped them if I come home
[1:15:27] she said yeah I think it would
[1:15:30] I packed up came on
[1:15:33] I never prayed for him when I got home
[1:15:37] why because it already finished it was
[1:15:39] done
[1:15:41] if that was God it's going to be taken
[1:15:43] care of it wouldn't God would go back to
[1:15:44] the doctor
[1:15:45] I don't worry about it
[1:15:48] right come on
[1:15:52] gifts and callings are without
[1:15:54] repentance
[1:15:57] those prophets bring in that word of God
[1:16:00] the prophet said it was not for not for
[1:16:03] ordained
[1:16:05] not everybody
[1:16:09] 's not for ordained like a prophet's
[1:16:11] foreign
[1:16:19] gifts and callings are are foreordained
[1:16:25] let me get one more real quick
[1:16:35] this is taken from works as Faith
[1:16:37] expressed 1965.
[1:16:39] if what if Moses would have said sir
[1:16:41] just a moment
[1:16:45] I thought I was talking to an
[1:16:46] intelligent being
[1:16:49] this great I am that you say you are you
[1:16:52] know the burning bush right well Moses
[1:16:56] but how in the world will I ever take
[1:16:59] this little old Crooked Stick I got here
[1:17:01] in my hand
[1:17:03] and take over an army of millions of men
[1:17:06] armed with Spears Fighters and I'm not a
[1:17:09] fighter I'm a sheep herd
[1:17:12] how can I ever do that there was no
[1:17:14] question why
[1:17:16] why
[1:17:18] the ground in his heart now listen to
[1:17:21] what he's saying
[1:17:24] once God said it to Moses and he met him
[1:17:26] there there was no question of Moses you
[1:17:28] understand what he's getting out
[1:17:30] he said the ground in his heart
[1:17:35] he was a predestinated person
[1:17:41] give some calling to our without
[1:17:43] repentance God had told Abraham that he
[1:17:46] would do that and there was no was the
[1:17:50] ground prepared
[1:17:52] a prophet before Moses had said it would
[1:17:56] be done it'd be done there so long you
[1:17:58] know in all the prophets it said and
[1:18:00] Moses just looked back and said okie
[1:18:02] dokie if I'm the one it's okay if it
[1:18:04] don't I just lose my head
[1:18:07] you know
[1:18:09] he believed it
[1:18:12] Abraham believed God
[1:18:15] why
[1:18:17] was he some Supernatural person don't
[1:18:19] you just believe God
[1:18:22] see that's where we fail at
[1:18:24] all prophets are predestinated tape the
[1:18:28] court trial a court trial 64 4 12.
[1:18:33] all prophets are predestinated we know
[1:18:36] that
[1:18:36] gifts and callings without repentance
[1:18:38] Jeremiah said
[1:18:40] before you would ever have conceived in
[1:18:41] your mother's womb I knew you and
[1:18:43] Sanctified you and ordained you a
[1:18:45] prophet to the Nations Jesus Christ was
[1:18:48] the woman's seed from the Garden of Eden
[1:18:50] John the Baptist 712 years before he was
[1:18:53] born Isaiah saw him and said he's the
[1:18:55] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[1:18:57] prepare you the way of the Lord see
[1:18:59] gifts and callings ain't laying hands on
[1:19:02] being hands on one another it's what God
[1:19:05] does
[1:19:08] born from that birth and those gifts are
[1:19:11] right in you when you are born
[1:19:15] come on musician
[1:19:18] in there when you're born
[1:19:23] it was in Moses
[1:19:28] but just get what I'm talking about now
[1:19:30] and don't misunderstand me
[1:19:33] they told us in school one plus one
[1:19:35] equals two two plus two equals four the
[1:19:39] next day they said one plus one equals
[1:19:41] two two plus two equals four I got tired
[1:19:44] of hearing one plus one equals one
[1:19:47] but you know what one day they asked me
[1:19:49] to write it down and I could put it down
[1:19:51] on a piece of paper
[1:19:53] and I could mathematically make it match
[1:19:56] right
[1:19:57] or I could take it and pull it back the
[1:19:59] other way and say
[1:20:00] four minus two is two yeah
[1:20:04] why because I had some ground prepared
[1:20:08] over constantly saying it so I
[1:20:10] constantly say to you where you won't
[1:20:12] misunderstand me especially internet
[1:20:13] people
[1:20:15] I believe that all things in God
[1:20:19] he foreknew what would take place and
[1:20:21] foreknowledge comes before
[1:20:22] predestination your Prophet says it so
[1:20:25] that's up to you
[1:20:26] all right it's four knowledge first then
[1:20:28] predestination those who before knew
[1:20:30] Paul said in Romans he did predestinate
[1:20:33] all right for knowledge is first
[1:20:36] then predestination comes or determining
[1:20:38] the factor but when it's the word or
[1:20:41] seed of God
[1:20:43] it is not the person that comes
[1:20:45] predestinated eternally from God that
[1:20:47] person is predestinated by God's
[1:20:49] foreknowledge
[1:20:51] but to see their word is predestinated
[1:20:53] eternally
[1:20:54] and is going to take place
[1:20:59] God gives you a promise don't doubt it
[1:21:02] he told me Wade was coming someone told
[1:21:04] everybody was coming
[1:21:07] the father he went away the more I said
[1:21:09] it
[1:21:12] that's just like people you know they
[1:21:14] try to find some arguments excuses
[1:21:16] and brother random told sister how do
[1:21:18] you write that her two boys would be
[1:21:20] saved you know in a few years after
[1:21:22] brother run passed on and not it's been
[1:21:24] back a while ago and you know but
[1:21:27] they said they both Baxley and gone out
[1:21:29] in the world
[1:21:31] that didn't change me
[1:21:33] well brother Ryan was wrong no he wasn't
[1:21:35] wrong
[1:21:38] are they coming back I don't care
[1:21:39] they're coming by forget it he said it
[1:21:45] yeah but they're back said
[1:21:51] I'm sorry that I have too good of a
[1:21:52] memory
[1:21:53] the prophet says we backslide every day
[1:21:56] how would you like that okay is there a
[1:21:59] big backsliding and a little
[1:22:00] riding remember the big ones are not the
[1:22:03] problems it's the little backslidings
[1:22:07] it's the little foxes that spoils of
[1:22:09] iron because we don't want to correct
[1:22:11] them the big ones we want to get rid of
[1:22:17] them I'm talking about a predestinated
[1:22:20] word of God that before the world ever
[1:22:22] begun for he ever it was anything other
[1:22:24] than Elohim self-existing he already had
[1:22:27] those attributes and those attributes
[1:22:30] was himself and he was going to see his
[1:22:33] children displayed amen
[1:22:37] when Senator depictionary didn't change
[1:22:39] the story
[1:22:42] it made him bring forth the rest of his
[1:22:44] attributes
[1:22:49] so those Prophets
[1:22:51] and they come with the word that word
[1:22:53] they brought
[1:22:55] was God
[1:22:56] you remember who was it Elisha that
[1:22:58] cursed the uh the the children but when
