========================================

right now good morning everybody out there you bombed upstairs today around just a little bit and let's let's just stand do a wonderful job of speaking under the people we pray that you would just rest each one and just have your way Lord I absolutely love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen we've just changed things around a little bit we ain't been gone and that's the way we do it but you know we started a few minutes early maybe we'd quit a few minutes early so I'm going to holler at me if I clock this morning I thought I might get started or not I know that Wade has been speaking to you for quite a while on the Statue of a perfect man and I don't know exactly what to live he's in on but what I want to do is go back and just take a basics and just speak on that from you know the scriptures that y'all been reading on and doing so if you want to turn in your scripture turn the second Peter one and we'll just read the scriptures and then we'll we'll go on into because all I want to read is like the first four or five verses because I don't want to get into the to the uh text to the doing this wage and they're doing them speaking on this background perfect man but to just speak on a kind of a a little something like light precious faith accomplish what we want we want study on for a minute the Sunday school I mean good to see everybody down here I didn't realize there was this many coming here they said we needed a bigger place so we might have to do it someday just walk around some of these rooms but now let's just read your scripture Peter and the Apostle of Jesus Christ to The Strangers scattered throughout on his relationship Cappadocia Asia and Bethany elect according what number four knowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit until obedience and strengthening of the blood of Jesus Christ I'm reading theater okay I couldn't wait to say I'm old I'm sick yeah 7123 all right let's go to where we're supposed to be excuse us out there Simon Peter are servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ are them that have a time like Precious faith for those through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace be grace and peace be modified unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain to life and God understood the knowledge of him that have called us to Glory merger for by our given unto us now what exceeding great and precious promises that by these the prophet emphasizing these promises all right that you might be partakers of the divine nature have an escape the corruption that is in the world through lust then you go into the virtues but what I wanted to say is talk a minute about you know like Precious faith because it says there that if you promised but who is it promised to now if we read the scripture there and it says promise all right then what we're reading is a promise okay so if it's a promise then we can depend on you know receiving and we don't have to worry about it all right but who's it too continuing great and precious promise right now that's the point I want you to think about the prophet said on paragraph 33 of the Statue of perfect man this is not to the world now I've always told you you know from the ministering to you the Bible is not written to the world you eat Us in the basis for them to read and see Christ all right but the Bible is really written to those that are in Christ Jesus okay now you understand my points see then it's to someone to bring them to Christ but that's like a letter that I would write to my wife and I would be over sneezing when I'd write a letter to her all right now the letter is to her and her only but I may say you know uh is the kids doing all right until the kids Hello are they doing this are they doing that or you know and all because that can be a part to them to somebody else so for a sinner to read the Bible he can read the Bible and see that he needs to be saved but really the Bible that he reads is you right that's the one that brings him to this knowledge that we need to have all right now Peter said he was speaking to those of light precious faith all right now the light precious faith in other words it's just one Faith one Lord one bad future right there's not many things there's not many things there's many there's levels but not many different faiths there's only one Faith one Lord one bad kid all right so then Peter was telling these people the space that's what he starts off telling you all right and he said then I'm speaking to you that has this Faith all right now he's not telling them of the Statue of perfect man the growth development in his first readings he's only telling off this faith this new birth because you can't answer it says add to your faith well how did you get that faith it says add to your faith virtual mother how did you get the value you can only get it by being born again ain't no man can call Jesus a Christ except what except it be by the Holy Ghost all right it's got to be an inside teacher there's no way you can can say well uh you know this is to everybody it's not now listen to what I'm saying then this statue of a perfect man was to be basically in the end time because the way was lost through the ages of this that we needed these favor International you know and it was only coming forth with just a new birth but now we're commanded to go forth into the statue of perfect man he'll bring about a Rapture all right now but back up see if we don't have the life pressure faith Peter said I've got that thing reading your scripture there and he said I'm talking to you that have that Faith you that have the new birth I have the new birth he said and you need the new birth before you can even get started there's no promises to you without anybody right right you're not promised anything but the the world and condemnation and death and Sorrows if you're reading the Bible see that's what I'm trying to say to us upstairs about the law this Bible becomes just a law right because it can only condemn you right until you're born again you cannot have anything to set you free so you can't be the Bible's not written to you and does everybody understand that it's written that a sinner can read it and become saved but it's not written to him it's written to those that are in Christ go over to Ephesians the Saints and emphasis the Romans abilities for those that are in Christ Jesus I think it's not written to the world it's written to you and I that are born again why do you understand that then we must have the new birth the prophet said that's the most important thing in the world it's whether or not you're born again well I need these virtues well you can't get the virtues until you're born again right I mean Josiah now Jonas he can't uh he can't grow as a baby or didn't until he got here now we know he did in the womb coming up to the state but he wasn't wasn't alive he wasn't doing it but then there was a day that he'd become alive then he can start growing in his nature and already now you know he's beginning to develop his own nature he's one of uh Rising her children each one has a little different nature identical twins one will have one form of a nature it will have another you remember the one that sister Cooley had years ago the picture of the the two girls that just had one body from here down we get up here there was two heads and and they had their own individual thinking well I'm like boy the other one did right it was so odd to me that they could be that much connected until they didn't have to stay you're on that side move that hand you're on that side but if it didn't have to do it their brain was so connected with everything until it just moved and wonderful but yet they still had a different nature and that's what about it through the statue of a perfect man see but before now my point is is number four before you ever start the growth development you must have the new birth it's not a question of whether or not as Richard said when he read it he'd never seen that when he came down you know with us years ago he'd never seen that that it was a necessity you had to have it you've got to have these virtues in this day you know because this is the value of the time whatever age had a new birth so every age Peter could have spoke to the church in the days of Martin Luther it just had to adjust your live by faith attend anywhere he could have spoke to them and said you know it's like Precious Faith that's what I want you to see the light precious faith is the new birth don't worry about the the gross the thing we'll get to it in a minute when the prophet tells you how to do that how do you how did the baby grow you stopped feeding Jonas and what happened he won't grow but you keep feeding him that's all you got to do you just got to feed him Lord the prophet said you keep drinking in you keep pushing out he said now you don't take apples and pour them at the root of the tree yeah this is his work you don't take apples or oranges or something pour them at the root of the tree and then they grow this is it's in there we said you've got to keep putting the water on it which is your washing for the Water by the word all right so then it's a necessity that we have the life precious faith we must have a new birth before we can get started you said well I don't know whether I had enough well then that's what you need to work on you don't need to work on all this other over here that's fine but you need to work on whether or not you're born again because that's the point that you got to start from you can't even start the growth development Jonas couldn't start developing as a child until it was born so is it with us we have to have then the light pressures faith and that's the first four verses she is dealing with that and if you have the light precious value he said then these promises all right promised unto you if you have the new birth if you don't have a new birth there's no promise me right but you get the new bird then when you receive the new birth and you say okay I'm in line I'm in the family I'm I'm in that part now I could grow and do this and I can the Lord can use me to to do things and and will speak and do through the statue of a perfect man but you first got to have that light precious faith and see that's why the Bible is not written into a sinner it's written to those that are in Christ Jesus the church should help says the church is to murder the church at Philadelphia you know all of the seven churches the lady will see you it's written to the bride of Christ now in the church we do know that it spoke out some of the fault time too but yet we're dealing with coming into Christ all right now the prophet said it like this he said after coming into the body that's positioned in Christ he said after you come in the body then these are the things we expect you to have it expects you to grow but the main thing is the life precious faith and if we don't have that it's not speaking to us well brother now I've been in the message 40 years we're wonderful but have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe bro do you have the Holy Spirit that's the thing it's not whether or not when we need to go somewhere where that they teach this that or the other we need to go to another church where they can and tell us these things I'm I've never said anything about anybody that goes anymore jail never said anybody was off the word for living here but I do say one thing if you live here trying to go there to find something to help you it's not going to do you any good to get born again no matter where you're at what you're doing it's not going to do any good until you're born again all right so get born again then if you want to go somewhere downstairs that way then there's no problem because that way you can go by the growth development but now you know but even pray here if you are set on the basis that we do handle the word hard we do require that much well if you can find more than what we do here let me know because I won't taste from dark and if we can we'll have to go there to get it because I want it too but I want these virtues all right and I know we brought him a priests did there in 71 I ask him I said you worked in this state as many times I said brother Lord that's wonderful but now how do I get to virtue because he spent lengthy time that rough takes if you want to listen to him he spent lengthy time explaining the precious promises and the different things just what I'm saying right now you know first we're born again that gives you light pressure today not written to the world written into the bride of Christ and I believe then we get the promises of these things we can we can do we can have the promises then well because we're alive and then he started from fighting first or not and I asked him I said how do I get them because you look at it you see where it says patience well you say well tribulation working patient so we'll just take a will we'll start working each other you know and all of this that the other that wouldn't work too good would it I don't think that would even bring it and I put us all in jail but see it's not that to bring in and knowledge is not intellectual understanding I know the way it's been through these things it's Holy Ghost knowledge well if you ain't got the Holy Ghost how can you have Holy Ghost knowledge you got your own thinking until you're born again your own knowledge your only way of going you know until you're born again all right so we need the life precious faith and once we get that life precious faith see then we can start growing all right so then the main thing today is what make sure you got it well brother Dale I've been in the message 40 years I'd hate to go tell somebody that I wasn't born again but I do he'd rather do that than the mission I've always told you that I'd rather be seeking God all my life you know he can do it and find out I got it then do not seek him and get down there and find out I didn't have it he said well can we do that that's what he said about the lady that's on Sunday school you know all the things the rather explain that about a lady so he got down the end of the road and she cried out for the preachers and you lied to me that's one thing you can't hear say that we haven't taught you the new birth now some of you have been to other churches and come from other places and been there how much did they talk about the new murder no it was a great revelation of the density of great things and Glory Hallelujah and we're this and we're that the other and then they get into all these doctrines and idea and when they do what does it give you maybe can't get one time on that expression watch your passion completely won't show she said I don't know if I've been there good for a year never heard anybody count well you know I think after a couple years Lord at least get around talking about Who We Are in Salvation because it's in the soul not in the body but he understand it won't say get the new bird then you can worry about it and it's like I've told you then the Lord showed me finally in 19 about 1980 you said if you receive the word reveal or not letter that you read as you receive the reveal word it will bring these virtues all right now I'm a firm believer in growth development and a lot of people think you can just jump up here and get this and jump over here and get that now I'm seriously I don't believe in Jungle I believe in growth development that would be like saying Jonas there you know beginning to take a step or two next week you won't be running in the marathon no I'm not quiet now not exactly do you think well I can jump up here and get this I think I need I think I need knowledge so I just jump up here and get knowledge oh why not get started goodbye they can use a little like Precious faith and then what's made from a virtue no I want knowledge we'll see what you're doing you're bypassing the channel of the way God brings you now sure we even receive as you see The Headstone on the pyramid we received from that as a pool to us that's what we're magnetized to if you have that new birth at the bottom right and you're pulling from that that headstone is pulling you but don't say I got The Headstone but now I need virtue now you're going backwards just like I said if you say well I don't need to do birds I just need to I need somebody to teach me to mention pretty deeply confidence you can be taught a lot of hidden knowledge that's not the knowledge in the statute perfectly and see reading is wonderful we do that we we do at least today but you could be listening to uh the seal you're going to be listening to a series in the sealed or something and just listening to the tapes of running around and God may give you virtue you say well that virtuous stream well strength is is one what is strength in this natural perfect thing it's the word of God that has given you strength the revealed word of God each one of those virtues is more and more of the reveal word yeah but I'm up here in front of the kindness well how did you get up there how did you jump and run into college I mean did you run and jump a ladder and it went way up no no you can't get up to brotherly kindness until you come from virtue knowledge Temperance patience God's Mission now that doesn't mean that you don't have a brother to become that means you don't have a godliness about you that doesn't mean that you don't have patience but it means in the statute of Earth man that's not talking about this natural brother I'm sitting there what he said you can have a portion of these virtues are not even be born again there are good people in the world that has a lot of those virtues right not even Christians right but that don't change it can you please please how to get the newborn there in this day that we're living in we're not back in the other ages okay highest quick run through in the days of Luther it was just to believe now that gave them the new birth like I said Luther probably preached many times on you know about justification probably preached sermon done lectures on justification of what it meant but one day God quickened it under me and said and just shall live outside that was his new birth All Right Wesley come in with sanctification you got a lot of other doing but then it was sanctification be in the days of Wesley and West we believe what Luther taught and the judge shall live a fight but then he's saying that you must be sanctified that doesn't mean Luther wasn't sanctified Luther goddess sanctification he got the new birth he got to cleanse him out watch in a second if we go up come back down all right Pentecostals come along with the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right requiring the three stages or three works it's really not words but coming up to the New Birth all right now then you must receive in this day justification by Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ that I believe is a definite work you don't just come in the message and say you know we preach the sermon today brother Bob gets through somebody walks down to the Altar and they say I want the Holy Ghost well they've never heard anything well I'm not saying God can't do it because he can do what he wants to but I'm saying that most of the time you ain't gonna do it that way that's why brother Branham you notice he'll say you people hear you come to the office he said now get with these other brothers and bank and get them to pray for you to receive the bad kids from the Holy Ghost all right see then that's what it is you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ you repent and say father forgive me and I believe all that this Prophet is taught I believe the word you know all right that'll cleanse that old thing out of you read page 14 15 16 of the future home that's the best one to go to all right now let me get that part before and then we'll come back all right then see you get sanctification I believe in a definite work of justification I definitely work with sanctification a definite work with a baptism of the Holy Ghost and what a lot of people does they say I get it all here okay praise God if that's what you got but if that's not what you got then you just you ruin that stuff you go from justification sanctification and then the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the person of Jesus Christ coming in you it didn't come in you when you repented of your sin you're only going to work in your life sanctification is very close because that Spirit does come in enough to cleanse out like the glass you pick it up that just for the day all right sanctification you wash the glass you scald it you do everything to clean it it looks good but then you need to receive the baptism in order to go well you say well then what how do I know I've got it it's whether or not the spirit of you agrees with the word now agrees means keep on it's not just you say I believe I believe it either believe it and he's baptize you'll be so all right see then you go through the stages you receive the new birth that gives you the light precious faith that Peter's picking up Peter had went through those things in his life he had been justified by Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ right followed him he was Sanctified in Saint John 17. right when Jesus explaining the unclean Spirit goeth out of a man walking to the drive all right but he didn't have the new birth until he got to the death penthouse and see then I believe in a definite time to be justified Jump Off You By sin Sanctified please and set aside and then the new Bible I want it all at once by the word by the word right I want it all at once that's the way we are right but that's not God's way of doing it now I need to do that if you want to but it's according to the nature of the person to do it you got to remember one thing you know Sister truly if you're real quick you got to remember one thing those are possible for three and a half years never had anywhere because Jesus Christ did not die see this took them three and a half years to be justified and sanctified right and it was done gradually by the washing of the water of the word that Jesus was bringing in in coming out and then on that Pentecost and see Jesus we're saying of over 500 brethren but there was only 120 maybe Upper Room those 380 didn't get to hold you a while ago I ain't seen it didn't later yet but didn't get it back unless the other one going into the layer could have been that's right go ahead or do you have to have the Holy Ghost a revelation okay yeah a revelation my Center can receive a revelation but it's a time frame Etc it is not eternal life it is like for healing cleansing you know it's a revelation oh Abel had a revelation Saints could get a revelation but it would not give them the new birth all right that Revelation then was I called it a time frame or a situation right and see then we can get a revelation I believe justification is a definite revelation of Jesus Christ not necessarily truly one God not necessarily the seals the plagues about the the 70s and that it's not that it's when you come to the place that you receive a revelation if you are lost I believe that's a revelation to a sinner that he's lost he needs to be saved that you see there in the scripture and what must we do to be saved all right now here's what the prophet said they asked him what must we do to be saved we tell them about the rules right we tell them to quit this do this do that he said they didn't ask that question they asked how could they be born again and how did Peter say too repent every one of you and be baptized repentance and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the home all right see so you wouldn't get baptized did you you're not even in a promise you're not even a line productive you're not doing it you just I'm trying to make something work but see have you really come through a time that when you remember when you first started and I'm not saying it when I turn the denomination through the bad just imagine this or something that you first believed on the Jesus Christ you first read then well then you could be Sanctified I believe I was I'm honestly I believe after I come to the message of sanctification that I know what happened to me I know that I come to a place I had seen God heard me tell that story but that didn't make me say no way but I'll search for that God and I repented many many times crying out before God wanting that God had come to live in me I believe he come and cleanse me because I didn't have to worry about a lot of the things that was on after I learned what the problem read page 14 15 16 Utah but then when I come into the message and saw what the new birth was and Prophet was saying he's teaching to me and a person comes into you that's the way I see it that a person comes into you to give you a new birth it's not just washing it out cleansing it up making everything good and somebody got to come in come on see then when I seen that I started searching for that for two years a bit more out under the position of receiving the new birth so there's no problem would I not even see that the problem is what we're going to do my precious Faith Peter them three and a half years before they received that light precious faith see he wasn't talking about that he just believed you remember in the later in the scripture take a second remember later in the scripture where he said a more sure word prophecy he was on the mountain with Jesus he's seen all those things he said now I've got a more sure word of Christ look he had an inward experience and the only way the growth development can take place in the sacrament is first and inward experience and then that inward experience you just keep going tonight you pushing anybody else offered anything real quick I just thought about doing this for you know to try to back ends up maybe it could wait and well waited perfect man I'm sure but I wanted to say we need light pressure because that's the way we understand nobody okay you're dismissed
