pray for dad also he'll be nursing for a few weeks we'll all be somewhere else on vacation but just remember him in your prayer mom will be okay she can take drugs maybe they give him some too I don't know we'll find out when we get home but just remember that also remember next week will be the fellowship meeting Saturday at 3:30 brother Gerald Hughes will be preaching the fellowship meeting and also he will will be preaching Sunday so keep him in your prayers now there was an announcement to bring um whatever you sisters got from Mom but let's add to that because he's going to he's calling me this afternoon after the second service to tell me how many people are coming but they are canceling their services at his place and he's going to try to get them to come over here so if he does that means we're going to have to put a little more water in the Soup pot so bring one more vegetable and a few more pieces of pork chop and chicken or whatever mom gave you the the uh the list to bring but just bring another vegetable and uh add a little more soup to the pot because they may be 30 or 40 more or they may not be but three or four more but we're going to uh know today brother Gerald will call me so I'll be able to let you know more on Wednesday night and also the camp meeting remember uh brother the burley's camp will be in 2 weeks really 3 the 29th 30 31st and 1st just remember us as we'll be leaving Thursday morning sister Gwen and brother Joe myself and June and um sister Rebecca Atkins and uh boy and Janet's coming later on and I think GE and and Danny's coming later on too to help us out we're about $2200 short on what we need and we need to get it really quick because we we got to start buying the stuff okay so we need about 200 more bucks and we'll be ready to go other than that thank you for giving for your support the ones of you that gave uh we really thank you this is the second year we've done this for those of you that are that are new here or didn't know about it we um contribute to a a a kids camp actually it's kids up to adults for brother Burley Williams in South Carolina and we provide all the food cooked about 1500 meals last year so and that was uh all due to what you give because the church didn't add a dime to it it was all from what you people gave from the congregation as far as feeding or as far as making uh cakes and cookies and first one thing and another and this year by the grace of God brother Joe's got all that cookie and and Kate stuff donated to us so we thank God for that so you sisters don't have to don't have to do what you did last year but uh just keep us in your prayers uh like I said we need a couple more uh $100 to to finish out and we'll be ordering everything from Sam's Club up there in Anderson and picking it up as we go so brother boy he didn't know he bought that long trailer to haul all of our stuff up there but uh that's exactly why he bought it for so while we're standing let's turn to the book of Colossians and uh we're going to kind of revisit that maybe a little bit of something that we spoke on several years ago on a just a change Prophet said what someone ask him what was the mystery of the translation and he gave him the most profound thing he could say he said it's just a change Colossians 1 verse 12 let's bow our heads de Heavenly Father we pray Lord today that you would come Among Us in a special way Lord and just touch our touch our voice Lord and you be the one that speak father you take the preeminence of the service and father though we be a Cast Away Lord may you use our voice Lord to get to someone Lord to to Quicken your word to them Father we pray Lord that you would just bless us and be with us be with Mom back home Lord as they I would assume they're now listening on the internet through live streaming that you would just touch her father and just be with her bless her be with Dad touch him and of there helping Lord and just be with each one just take Lord each one of us and heal us father you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so as the word Goes Forth father may it not be void you said it wouldn't be you said it would accomplish everything that you said it would that's right so now father we pray that as it goes forth that everything that is there a need for healing or salvation or Deliverance are just a closer walk with you that today Lord that that will be accomplished father you give us the greatest word you gave us the greatest people you gave us the greatest Prophet you gave us the greatest Revelation father in this end time and now we pray that we would humble ourself enough Lord to let you come in and just take preeminence of this Total Service Lord and it Be Your Will and your way father in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen Colossians 1:12 giving thanks and to the Father which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light so we have an inheritance who hath delivered us from the power of Darkness now what I want to look at today is is there's a lot of things that we think we have to do when we really don't have to do anything cuz who's doing all this who hath delivered us from the power of Darkness we can can't do that uh brother Aaron kind of gave you the one side of of being unbelievers this morning well we're going to take this afternoon and become we're going to take what we can and be Believers all right cuz unbelief will kill you but belief will put you in a Rapture all right unbelief will keep you out belief will put you in uh powerful word and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son the word translating change is the same thing all right in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins now let's go to Philippians just turn back about two pages in your Bible to Philippians 3 verse 20 and 21 just something today that maybe will will kind of help your faith we're not doing a lot of teaching that for today it'll just be something that'll help your faith cuz we all need help for our conver ation is in heaven from whence also we look for the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change our vile body who is going to do that the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned all right like unto his glorious body we got to have something original to start with with according to the working whereby he is able not you not Gail Addison according to the workings whereby he is able even to subdue all things now when the Bible says all things it means everything Brother Gary from the top to the bottom unto himself you may be seated and the Lord has bless to the reading of the word if somebody give one of these out right here well brother Donnie's standing up you okay he can get a m thank you just something to kind of read over and keep while we're we're going to read it in just a minute but the word translating change is the same I want you to see today that that we're going to look at this as the Bible says fashion shaped of formed or morphed if you look at your uh what they're giving out you remember the prophet made an illustration about uh oh before we get through here uh sister Rebecca Calhoun keep her in your prayers she is having a baby now so just uh keep her in your prayer she's in going into labor so we thank God for that but now listen we've come to the end time where there's no other age left there's no other Bible to be written there's no other Prophet to come to bring anything in the end time we're the last we are the last form of God this world will ever see whether you believe that or not am let me restate that we're the last form of God this Earth will ever see in the form that it is now one day that's going to strike home and we're going to turn into a Pentecostal church I tell you people we going to have to get a little life amen I sat back there W the other Wednesday night brother past was preaching and y'all were looking at the walls and the steing sleeping playing with the kids looking in the floor I don't know what we're doing during service but we need to be here and we need to listen to what God has for us cuz I don't believe anything is done by chance I don't believe we just come to church just to be a formality we didn't come to church just to say hello how are you I love every one of you to death but I came here today to talk to God the Creator because he's the one that's going to change me not Danny fountain or anyone else the closest friend you have he's not going to change you he may change you in the wrong direction hello but God will never change you in the wrong direction he'll always change you to the word of God like brother Aron said this morning we must be subject to the word of God but we we're not only see Luther could get by with being born again and he could drink beer and smoke a pipe and talk about God because that's all of God that he could see when the Bible said that just shall live by faith now let me tell you something Luther's faith in the just shall live by faith is the same faith that you and I are going to have to have to get out of here cuz there's no big Faith little faith it's faith in God's word that you understand right am that you understand not your neighbor not the guy down the street not the guy sitting over across from you he may be a deceiver but the faith that Luther had is going to take him in a Rapture the faith that Luther had is going to change his body but now you and I have got to come to a place to where we only not we've not got to just have the faith to change our body we've got to have faith to not die right and change our body okay now that's what the prophet had to come to bring he had to tie the loose ends together because you and I were so scrupled up Luther was scrupled up in his Doctrine in a way where he was still baptizing in father son Holy Ghost he was doing the things like that and like I said he would he would um you know smoke a pipe and and sit in a pub being a German and uh but we don't drink German beer and smoke German pipes because that's not what we do we've come to a place to where God has brought us to another position a higher level than what Luther was but remember let's go back to the bottom Luther's faith is what's going to translate him he had to die his faith only took him to a certain place but he had to die but you and I our faith is going to have to take us to a certain place to where we don't die but now is it something that's going to be so far farfetched to where we can't attain to it nowhere God wouldn't have put it in his word if God put it in his word I'm just dumb enough to believe it amen all right how will this translation take place did you have enough Don yes okay maybe you didn't have enough for me oh I got one no I got one I kept one for myself I keep mine in Red so I can I can figure out where I got it from let's see what the prophet said and then let's just base what we're going to say today just off of what this one quote and questions and answers in 1964 830 please explain the mystery of the translation of the Bride just to change see our bodies now let's say our you know what I mean when I say that I don't mean to be sacri religious I don't mean to say ours I don't mean to say this church I mean to say every believer then he goes on and he talks about Abraham we'll get back to that in a minute let's go to what underline part and we cannot receive the promised son that's promised to us today and these bodies that we live in these bodies are sin all right keep going this first conscious controls this body with C taste feel smelling here and that's just got us all scrupled up we reason and everything else but that new body that comes from this born again now where are you born again in your soul today right now sitting where you are with the new birth you are being translated whether you believe that or not but if you're born again you should believe it if you're not born again you won't believe it but that new body that comes from this born again not this first conscience it'll pass away so you're not born again out here where you can see this guy you're looking at today all right you're born again from the inside fella all right it's that inside something that lives everybody understand say Amen congregation replies very weakly amen it's not this outside SE taste feel smelling here it isn't it's subject to death and will die but the inside part of you down in here inside that is the person that cannot die and that's the person that the Life Starts from from this new birth and it builds another person in the image of this person you are around that life you get it now where are you born again again again again in your soul where you're sitting today so that's where it's going to do all its work you don't have a body that's hanging in a closet somewhere or or or you don't have something that's being built in another world but truly we have a soul that's being that that's being formed in the image of God right now today in another dimension that's right because if you're born again today you have eternal life that man never sinned never did a a uh anything wrong right but you're sitting there with it in you today truly it is in another dimension because this Dimension is all death and sorrow and shame and and and all those things now let's listen so potentially it's in here and what is it here's the thought for the day the word promised before the foundation of the world right God when he told Abraham he said I mean when he told Adam he said don't do this do this do this don't do this we broke it you and I human beings he said do this don't do this if you eat that tree you'll be okay if you eat this tree you won't right choice he gave you choice amen but now and we broke it now when we come to Abraham what happened with Abraham he said Abraham I've already done it I'm going to do it there's nothing you're going to have to do with it you're just going to have to walk through the Journey and I'm going to be right there with you all right cuz at the end did Abraham change his own self the word promised before the foundation of the world yeah and around there this only reflects the negative that will reflect the positive the word see the same thing is or the translation of the Bride will be the same thing the word that's in you the body will materialize around that word and the same thing did by Sarah when that old body that she had that first body it had to be changed in order to produce a sun you get it that body could not do it this body cannot do it so it has it'll have to be changed the same way to receive the sun now Abraham did not get up he didn't go to bed with an old 80y old or 90y old Sarah that was blonde headed and blue-eyed when she was young and wake up with a blackheaded blackeyed woman right or he went and said I mean I'm sure he looked over and said who is this beautiful woman laying beside of me but he saw it was Sarah right it wasn't Sarah transformed somewhere else and another woman come into view no no no it was the same Sarah that Abraham started with you get my point all right God's going to change us but it's not going to be a change brothers and sisters like the world says that we're going to throw this old body away and get us a new one where is it going to come from come on oh it comes from God now wait a minute the Bible says that God created this world right this Earth to be inhabited and he got all of our bodies out of this earth right and if you take this world and you take this Earth Back to Before the fall it was sinless that's right perfect that's right right right that's what we were kind of discussing a little bit in the ministers meeting yesterday you and downstairs in the Sunday school class you uh you know the Millennium is a step going back toward the future home it's not the future home there certain things can happen in the Millennium that's not in the future home but God's riding this ship back up he's getting everything back in shape during the millennium so that that future home can come down on the prophet said a redeemed entire Earth right now if the Earth happens that way your body's going to have to happen that way cuz your body goes first a redeemed entire body not a body that we always thought in the denominations that that when the Bible says a new Heaven and a new Earth that this Earth was going to be blown away and we were going to go live on some Cloud up in heaven somewhere playing a heart I don't I don't even like them playing a harp and and me and brother klie would just pass through each other you know we couldn't shake hands right and even our Prophet thought that remember he thought him and brother Neville would just you know come right by each other and say hello well that's not a way to live for eternity that's right I really don't want to do that I agree with you I don't want to do that I want some solid flesh grab hold up say Hey sister God bless your heart that's right glad you made it but now we find out even the Bible was telling us all along that the word new was not annihilate and create again cuz God will not create again he's creating inside of me and you right but he's not going to create a new Heaven and a new Earth cuz everything that he created the first time I believe was perfect man's the one that created the fall the sin and then God had to judge that sin just like he judges me and you in this earth right here cuz I got a new Earth when I got born again I got a new Earth but this Earth is still 50 years old it still was you know it was born again you know 12 years ago and and I'm 50 now and it looks older and this earth looks older but you know what inside of me the word that was promised before the foundation of the world God took that picture of me between 18 and 20 years old and I'm not going to change from that right I'm a young man trapped in an old body so are you don't laugh real a lot of you is real older than I am but in God we're all the same age am and our God is not some God with a beard and a can cuz our God's so old you know who want a God that walk out there and go that's the world the world everything the world sees of God tell me has anybody ever saw a picture of God that this world makes a young man hopping and skipping and jumping no they always make him an old man with a cane yeah long beard you know look kind of like Moses or something you know I don't like that this man was old because of my sin that's why he looked that way but when he resurrected that he was a fresh young man right remember Mary magdalin thought he was a gardener that's right that's why he was so young he got changed back that's right she didn't know him at 20 years old so she didn't recognize his form but when he said Mary the voice don't change come on remember brother brandham said that angel one time when that angel spoke to him he said I knew it was an angel that spoke to me when I was a little kid The Voice doesn't change amen you can hear the voice amen bless you but look on the bottom of your page caterpillar to a butterfly right and I know there's a lot of illustrations to that but inside that caterpillar is a butterfly inside that egg is a chicken we were talking about um eggs yesterday at the minister meeting and one brother said wait a minute he stood up great big fell he said wait a minute he said we're not a bunch of chickens I don't want to be classified with a chicken egg he said let's talk about eagle eggs I said okay let's make it an eagle egg then but he uh he didn't want to talk about chicken egg but like brother Joel for he says he said the the the the chicken is the egg revealed right and that's what it is right same way with the caterpillar right the caterpillar is a part of the I mean the butterfly comes out what it was a caterpillar right you can't deny that it was a caterpillar right but inside that caterpillar is that when when the right conditions are met is a butterfly right see now you and I were not born with eternal life you know just be just God we were born in sin shapen in iniquity we needed God we needed life that caterpillar needed life but because the caterpillar has life the caterpillar eats the right thing the caterpillar one day transforms our metamorphous into what a butterfly but all the time inside that caterpillar was a butterfly that's why we need to start look you know brother ROM said one time he said he said we need to look at our in other words paraphrasing we need to look at our brothers and sisters differently than just looking at them through human eyes we need to look at them Through The Eyes of somewhere down inside all that mess that's right is God Amen it's God and if there's not God then you know we need to start praying for those people to get God in their life because it'll change you transform you amen but listen everybody is is so they think that this translation thing I I I just I'm just guessing that this trans ation thing is so far out you know that that we can't attain to it because when we get up every morning it pretty much proves it we have to do this right we have to put little Bing gay on places we didn't have before we didn't know we had muscles there brother collie I know you know that cuz you smiling he used to climb up in a deer stand now they now I think that's why they built ground blind we used to when we first started hunting man we we'd get get on those Baker tree stands we go 40 ft in the air and I mean I'm talking about climbing with your arms holding like this you know going up the tree then they made them two piece where you could sit down and do this now they made them where you can sit on the ground I like them on the ground too myself I don't don't bother me any but uh brother Hal Thomas when he hurt his foot I gave him a uh I gave him a little sniper Shack thing to step behind he says he uses it all the time right but thank God for that that's kind of a metamorphosis in the in the human way we met metamorph into it's what I always said about U old people you know having those all those hearing aids and Band-Aids and walking aids and all those AIDS things that they need so but you know what that's the human part but we got to see that that human part has got to be done away with but not annihilated like we go back to the earth the earth is not going to be destroyed and then we go live somewhere else on a new Earth no it's this Earth that God made to start with just clean off same thing happened to you and I when the night that you were born again or day or whatever it was that you were born again it didn't take you and just you know put a bomb in your inside and blow you up and then out stepped in you guy or girl or a woman whatever no actually probably you didn't change any of your facial expressions except for maybe you cleaned your mouth up a little bit like mine was you know and you cleaned your ways up but you were the same person that go that everybody could see on the outside amen now but what did God do he took the fire the fire of God that's what we're studying downstairs and I'll give you a little something to study on the uh Millennium is going to come from the fire of man which is the atomic fire brother BR said atomic will explode right now that don't kill PE that don't kill Souls right it just kills people and puts them in a in a dimension right but when you come to the to the to the Battle of Gog and MOG the Bible says the fire of God brother brandham said the fire would fall from God and God's the only one that can kill us all right so we come to that place to where God is to the place then where he can take and with his fire he can kill Spirits right so let's take that with you and I the Bible said you'll be baptized with Holy Ghost and Fire okay you're baptized with the Holy Ghost at your new birth right he burns out the inside guy but what's he going to do at this translation he's not going to annihilate the outside guy he's just going to take the fire of God burn all them Spirits out of you I hope that's what he's doing now right I hope we don't wait till we get to the end and say I'm ready now no we can't do that God it's a process you know why it's a process because he thinks about us cuz with God from the beginning to the end is this close together amen but with me and you it's a journey and you know what he kind of goes along that Journey with us and waiting on us because remember the Bible says that if you're born again right now that your soul is sitting in Heavenly places why because it's redeemed it's already finished there's nothing else for God to do to your soul today if you're born again except just keep let you keep feeding on the word caterpillar what happened to that caterpillar it gets big no we're not going to make a caterpillar out of this it gets big and it bursts open why does it burst open cuz it's eat all it needs when it eats all that it needs it burst open into a butterfly and that's what's going to happen to you and I this translation thing people is not so much that we can't believe that God's already started it right now right now job even stood up and he said though the skin worms destroy this body in my flesh I'll see God in my flesh that's right so whether you get and you know AIDS doesn't mean anything now you could die tomorrow you could die in 15 minutes had a lot of friends in the past year they went to school with that was actually younger than me they're dead they're gone that's right so don't pride yourself in that you're too young or don't say that it's so bad because you're so old that's right because in God that really doesn't matter but let's get into what we're doing here we're going to be here all night but in my flesh job said I'll see God My Flesh right not another flesh in my flesh I'll see God right now there's one thing that will not change you that will that will stop your change without death and that's unbelief what brother Aron was talking about this morning which is what sin it's not smoking drinking cursing running around that's not sin sin is disbelief in the word of God that's what killed Luther oh you get quiet but that's what killed Luther because Luther couldn't attain we say well Luther only had so much word well it was only so much word allotted to him I know but this Bible what didn't he read that just shall live by faith the Bible that the Bible he read didn't just have one page in it the Bible he read was just like this Bible you and I are reading but there was a revelation involved to him of just a small amount that he could see but there was another picture behind all that but he could only see through a very small glass but what you and I are in the end time is is we've had this whole Veil brought back we've had the whole Veil opened up to where we can see the word of God you know jun's um sister and and and um Kathy was discussing the Bible and they said they they don't think that you know that wearing shorts and not you know just like the denomination world do they don't care what they wear uh don't think that the word of God is all infallible and that's what Satan has tried to do down through through time he's he's made people disbelieve what's always been here read that quote again the word promised before the foundation of the world right now folks let me tell you something I know Dick's going to like this one you can take that Bible right here and throw it away and do whatever you want to with it disbelieve it it's not going to matter to God it's not going to matter to it didn't matter God did not get nervous when Abraham got 100 years old right right he didn't start shaking he said okay boys he said now it's time and he said you're not going to do it I'm going to do it right Abraham there was no way I've got a couple of quotes that I didn't bring brother randam said find me a way to translate your body from something on this Earth find me a way to heal a broke bone he he was talking about going to a drug store you going go to the drug store and say hey I got a broke arm give me some Sav to put on this on this broke arm and it'll just instantly go away there's nothing on this Earth nothing on this Earth that's going to translate us it's got to be what we believe amen has already been done right already I said been done that's right amen now we can build a case and say well this is the going wrong and this is going wrong it didn't matter with God God has promised it and he's going to have somebody to do it right and and and he's going to have somebody in this end time right now that's alive right the dead ones can't do it right it's got to be somebody alive breathing right right breathing alive they got to be here but folks the first thing let's turn to Philippians 3 back there again but the inside today has got to be settled we have got to settle ourself that the inside of our soul is already Eternal or we're not going to take a change right there's going to be nothing to change you with because what your Mom and Daddy give you is not going to change you I'll promise you that that's right remember our mom and Dad tried to beat our nature out of us hello Sterling's leaving so daddy told me one time I was 30 years old and I was just sitting at home and something happened he said Son as long as you put your under my table you're going to do what I tell you to do I don't care if you're 30 or 300 oh I said yes sir verse 13 everything is summed up in this right here and this is the most simple scripture and this may be the most quote unquote simple message you'll ever hear me preach but it's come to the basis that that we've got to be like Abraham we've got to know that that promise was given to you and regardless come what may whether your mama your daddy your brother your sister it's hard I know it's hard it's see Terence and Anna have always been Believers so it's not to me it's kind of commonplace that our family can sit down and talk about the word of God or or be you know and I and I deem that an absolute honor and a privilege amen but now has got family that's just rotten Sinners and they just beat on her all the time God's going to have to give you a reward for that because then she's going she's putting up with a lot more than I put up with so you know but I'm saying what I'm saying is Abraham probably had a lot of people that he told he was going to have a baby with at about 99 years old and they probably laughed at him look at poor old job job was was going through everything he went through all his best friends said job what' you do they didn't say job can we help you you know till till elu came by which was type of Christ came by and was telling telling joob hey job just get yourself out of the way right the other three was like what' you do job you go out and have a beer on the side over here somewhere or or I didn't see in church for three Sundays in a row I what's going on here no they should have said list let's pray about this but remember eloh you said I was sent from the presence of God and that's where we want all things to come from the presence of God whether friends do away with us where family does away with us irregardless of what happens listen to this Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing and here's a great Apostle Paul one thing that I've apprehended in other words in other words I've got got it if you apprehend something that means you had to go out and get it when the police go out they apprehend a suspect right this man's been apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind now I know the devil right now he's turning the screws and you're going back about 30 years or 25 years or 15 years or 15 minutes you did so and so you did this you did that let me tell you something people it's the same devil that sat on Abraham's shoulder and said Abraham let's just be honest Abraham you can't even perform your that you can't do anything to this and Abraham's like I know I know he just kept walking that's why we got to have the faith of Abraham that's why Abraham was the the father of our faith Abraham hey and Abraham got on his face he he laughed before God he give his wife away did that bother God nope or he wouldn't to give that promise to Abraham that's right but he knew Abraham was looking at a place right here in his journey not the journey but a place and that's what we'll talk about in just a second Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus a lot of people stop there let's read verse 15 let us therefore now Paul didn't leave us out he said let us therefore as many as be perfect ah how about that what's he doing he's giving us a position not just everybody sting in the congregation because you got M Believers unbelievers True Believers sitting right here today I didn't say that Prophet did he said those as many as be perfect now we'll never be perfect in other man's eyes but in God if you're born again today whether whatever done anybody tells you you're perfect I'll tell you you're perfect if you're born in today you're perfect that's right you're just as perfect as god is perfect yes all right as many as be perfect be thus minded what go back to the scriptures and read that that's what he's telling you be like be the same be thus minded and if in anything ye be otherwise minded God shall reveal even this unto you we come to a place that where that we have I have come to a place in my life that sometimes we get like Martin Luther I know some of you may have seen the the movie about Martin Luther but he tried to do in his conversion he tried to do so much Penance cuz he was Catholic he would lay on the floor he would crawl and he would actually talk to those demons that were talking to him about you know bad things and bad things that were going on in in in in his head and a priest one time told him pre Catholic priest told him said Luther you're going to go crazy and shortly after that is when God showed Martin Luther in the Bible that there was nothing that he could do that the just shall live by faith he turned right around and started preaching to his congregation to have faith in what God Said and that transformed a whole continent just by those few words the just shall live by faith Fai now here's a man that would crawl up steps he would he would lay prostate for hours like in a cross but he would lay with his face on the Rocks trying to get those evil thoughts out of his mind and trying to get all these things of the world that we deal with every day out of his head you can't do that Danny I've come to conclusion that I'm going to take what God Said because if Donnie fush said so it could be wrong but if God said so that's perfect if God said so that's why we have to be in this word right here this is what God Said So it ain't man it ain't man's ideas or theology it's what God Said God said so God said he's going to change or translate a group of people I'm just dumb enough to believe I'm going to be there right right now I'm going to prove whether I Believe It or Not by my journey all right now if your inside is settled then just let that work to the outside little caterpillar just keep eating but in second Peter 1 I want you to realize something something let's read that cuz I don't really think we understand the new birth like we should right I brother Bram said that right I have the quote where he said that that the new birth is the most ill taught thing right right well now it hadn't changed much in the 40 years since he's been gone right right and I hope some of the ministers don't hear this but there was a lot of things said yesterday that I still believe there's a lot of people even message preachers that do not know how to preach the new birth amen cuz nobody yesterday except brother Tim Calhoun said it was the birth of the word nobody it was this it was that it was this it was this it was doing this doing it's a birth of the word amen that you hold in your heart you cannot become born again if you haven't heard from God right what's he going to birth he's got a birth or Quicken the word that you hold on to right even brother brandham said the little woman at the well right her mama taught her that there was a messiah coming cuz she said we know when Messiah comes he'll do these things well if she hadn't known that she couldn't have said that we know she had been previously taught well now was God looking at a prostitute standing there uhuh no no he was not looking at a prostitute standing there cuz she went down to her country and and just set the whole world on fire all right second Peter 1 verse 4 let's just read verse one Simon Peter a servant and apostel of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained light precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ now Peter knew where his righteousness Came From Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertaineth unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given now what is the word given that means it's a gift somebody gives you something it's it's given to you right now if it was something that you had to pay for they sell you something but when they give you something it's a gift nothing has to be exchanged to get a gift whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature right deity in human flesh right amen deity in human flesh even had a preacher stand up yesterday and said that it wasn't God that dwelt in your soul it was a it was a um oh what he try to say anyway it was just something I didn't understand but my Bible says the divine nature of God right that's his soul exactly the very soul of almighty God which makes you God Amen not an OB wor exactly it makes you God having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust which is in other words what we think here right then add to your faith virtue and all those things but partakers of the divine nature right thank you divine right there's only one Divine that's right and that's God Amen he's not part Divine and part not Divine that's you and me right he's Divine from head to toe right every hair on his head is divine right and what did he do with this divine nature right he give it to you and me that's right that's why the Bible can say ye are Gods I wanted to stand up yesterday and say what about that yeah cats have cats dogs have dogs God has it's hard for you to say it or you have just said it Christian God makes right anything less you're the devil oh my amen right that's right I wanted you to say that L anything less than that you're the devil that's right that's right ain't that right that's right yeah because the devil is just that much lower than God and he had a create he knew he was created by that God but let's forget about the devil deity residing in human flesh right now if deity resides in human flesh then the Soul is already been glorified amen given white robes whatever you want to say this opens up all the Bible that's why the prophet had to bring bring us a new birth not different from Luther right but he expounded more on it to give us more power come on because Luther could have read this and and and and been you know said well maybe maybe no he lived on the just shall live by faith you and I have to live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God right and believe it right now the Bible even says those who he's truly Justified he's already glorified so what's our problem unbelief right unbelief because God said so and we don't believe it right this outside man that Mom and Daddy gave you is not going to take you any anywhere right it's the display of what's on the inside of you amen is going to take you somewhere right because that divine nature and still even folks listen with a divine nature of God you can still limit God and die you you ever heard brother BR make a real just a statement that was outstanding to me but I understand it more every day he said you can grieve the holy spirit cuz the Bible says grieve not the Holy Spirit where by yourself now you won't lose the Holy Ghost it's not like the Holy Ghost is you lose it and you die and go to hell no God's not an Indian giver when God gives you the divine nature he wants you to have it and he says to you come on people he said to you the same as he said to Jesus on the River Jordan he said this is my son in whom I am pleased to dwell if he gives you the divine nature of God he's pleased to dwell in you whether I don't like you or whether you don't like me that has nothing to do with exactly right right it's what God Said right all right all this goes together because our soul is sitting in Heavenly places that's right while our body is most of the time in hellish places so it's those two things working against each other but which one wins the old Chief says the one you feed the most now you're not going to kill the Holy Ghost but you can grieve him brother brand said he's a gentleman I was reading the other day I'm going back in the 56 and 57 series or 56 and yeah 56 57 series and reading and continuing end of the prayer lines cuz he had a lot of prayer lines during that time and he would uh he say don't move around right he said you're upsetting the Holy Spirit he said stay in your seat he said because he's very timid and he said he'll leave the building now got to know what he meant folks what do we do about that come on brother that Holy Ghost didn't leave when the prophet left that's right it's the same guy amen and us doing the same thing right that those people were doing think about that that Holy Spirit didn't leave because whatever happened to that Prophet is happening to you and I because it's the same God right same Holy Ghost same atmosphere the only thing is is there's not one person that has a gift of Divine Healing like that Prophet had right right right but even with that I I can take a hold of what he said right you know that the prophet that that Prophet would do two things you know restore all this back and take us on in the word well God never took that with the prophet he actually give it to me and you come on so the gift of Divine Healing is still here I've said many times before the Bible said that the word was the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart a long time before William Bram gotad right right so it was the word that he brought yes that was the discerner of the thoughts intense of the heart wasn't because there was a little man he said I'm just standing here right when he comes I'm just here he took over that vessel that's why you and I are going to have to come to a place just like that Prophet hear me out not for me to stand here and and let God Encompass this body for me to call out your sin hey the word of God's doing it I'm not the word of God's calling out your sin right now if you're not born again inside of you something's going hey I got a problem or hey he's crazy or hey that you know there's that unbelief part but he said I got myself out of the way and he said God use my voice right to do what what did he do because he said no Divine Healing no Resurrection right so what he said what you see in part he said one day you're going to see in its fullness man if that was parted what's the fullness going to be righten I even read one the yesterday U Friday Thursday he was making a comment about the bull and the bees and all that you know sending them back in the Hornets and all that and I'm trying to get it straight what he said but he said in other words he said that's happened before while I was alone in the woods yeah he said I've prayed in other words he was praying for animals that was in the woods right a deer hunter that's kind of that's that's kind of hard to understand you know you want to kill something then you want to pray for it but he knew he said I'm not a killer I'm a Hunter he said there's a difference and being a killer and being a hunter all right but see God was so much a part of that man's life till the only thing you know I believe the only thing that was holding William brandom here was me and you right right right I believe that the only thing that held William Brenham from taking a Rapture a translation of his body was me and you cuz we hadn't come yet right and we were spoken promised word before the foundation of the world and we had to come amen we were locked up in our mom and daddy or denomination or if you were alive or whatever sin but we had to come because the word of God promised it that's the only thing because he would be so much now what would happen here's a man standing here and we think well this you know it's going to be real hard for God to change this body we got to get out of that thought process because remember look down Through the Ages just take for example Elijah take Elijah Elijah went somewhere right right it was translated right Enoch went somewhere right God had to change his body because there's no way a human can just vanish from the face of the Earth without his body being somewhere Elijah went up in a chariot of fire think of all the other things what about old Phillip one day right what happened to Phillip Philip standing here preaching in a congregation and he vanishes about 300 miles away he reappears talks to a unit and even brother brandom says God here he come right back in a human body right that Mom and Daddy gave him right God changed his atoms we have a problem people and the problem is between our ears that we believe God can do this cuz we've been taught that we're going to die right we've been taught that we're getting older and we getting aches and we getting pains what about the three Hebrew children go dump yourself in a furnace and if God's not there see what will happen right I said if God's not there right what will happen but if God's there it was just hot enough to burn the latches off of their wrist right and the Bible said they were walking around down there with a man right and you know what Shadrach mesach and abedo walked out of that furnace and just went and live normal lives God had changed their atoms to something that it wasn't what their mom and daddy had give them it was something that God had given them and there's one key to this whole Pro this whole situation they weren't born again that's right that's right Elijah wasn't born again right Enoch wasn't born again right you and I are born again amen we ought to believe it more than they ever believe it amen what about Jesus we'll get back to brother Brown and then we'll quit let's get to Jesus Jesus walked up to a group of people one day and it's just the way I Think Jesus walked up to a group of people there was like several so many thousand people he said we're hungry he said what we got he said we got Five Loaves and two fishes Jesus didn't have to go get behind a rock right and pray about it right you didn't have to you know if it would have been me and you come on if it have been me and you first thing we said all right go to Walmart get us some flour uh we need a we need a big pot and some butter and some lard um we need to somebody need Dan you need to go catch fish for us about 5,000 if you don't mind in just a few minutes um and um G you need to go get us some wood and somebody get a fire going and in about two days we'll feed these people what Jesus do he took that bread and when he broke it he blessed it sorry thank you sister he blessed it when he broke it and handed it to the disciples something happened something happened it didn't just come back a doughy glob of bread it was cooked brother bam said one time he said I wonder what Adam was released in that Miracle he took the fish and blessed it and started handing the fish and when he did there would another one reappear already cooked and the people ate them so it didn't kill them and you know what there was enough left over so if they wanted more I like God's way of doing things amen not just barely having enough I like to have some left over yes he had about 12 baskets left over of this food that come from nowhere right and we worry about what God's going to do to this body when that man that did that is inside of us right now right now yes now brother brandham walks up to the platform person walks in front of him he tells them who they are what they're doing what they were doing what happened to them and said you got a tumor it's on your left lung now that wasn't brother Rand I'm talking that was God that's right but where did that tumor go when he pronounced them healed we know that he said there were several ways of doing it let's take it to a way where that the one that remember there was one on the lady's neck and it just fell off mhm what happened to those Adams in that woman what happened to that Old Gentleman down in Mexico that couldn't see right what about the girl that didn't even have any eyeballs she wasn't it she was just blind she was born without eyeballs right and the prophet even asked her what color she wanted now that sends cold chills down our spine but we got to do something about this who was that same creator that lives in you today right amen cuz that's what's got to happen limbs are going to be restored our body is going to be changed in the atoms our atoms are going to change back Abraham and Sarah were old men and women man and woman one day they would turn back to 20 years old now God didn't take that old body and kick it over in a hole and just say no he took the atoms that they were living in the same substance that they had always lived in and he changed it back to being young right they were changed in their atoms they were translated from an old person to a young person right and they weren't born again either right right thank you Father brother random what's the translation of this Mighty powerful bride in the end time just a change the word promised before the foundation of the world the word that's in you the body will materialize around that body same thing happened to Sarah and she didn't have the word in her like you do we're supposed to be the fullness of the word she wasn't the fullness of the word now then what is this all depending upon us or God know God's already said it right God's already promised it right he's already spoke it right can you believe so we can grieve the Holy Spirit that's going to change our body we're going to grieve him away one day and we're going to die an old man and an old woman or even a young man and young woman we're not promised in yet time right right that's our whole key people brother brandham always talked about the timidness of the Holy Spirit the timidness of the Holy Ghost him being a gentleman you say well well I've heard this before well you're going to hear it again cuz it's not doing us any good right now I mean until Jesus until the fish become another fish and it was cooked right right even Jesus the flesh man didn't do that it was the Holy Ghost Inside of Amen which is the father right which is the Lord Jesus Christ amen not Jesus the flesh but Jesus the flesh man said I know nothing right until the father shows me that's right okay well guess what you and I can't either that's right but if we have the father inside of us come on he promised it right amen that somebody's going to be changed right why can't we believe it right I'm leaving that in your lap today amen cuz it's up to me and you amen it's up to us right God's already put us in the place to where we need to be listen people listen then He we're we're in the right age see brother G we would have been we would have been radicals if we would have believed this in Luther's age cuz there's no way we could attain to this right we're in the right age at the right time with the right promise amen right what are you going to do about it what are you going to do about it that's why the prophets said no Divine Healing no resurrection that Divine Healing proved even with laugh he took a man that was corrupted his cells had already started breaking down and he was blow up like an animal on the side of the road right and that man spoke one word right Lazarus right come out of there amen and what happened was God didn't go over there and go Lazarus you don't need that body no more no he took the same substance the same corruptable he said I'm going to make Incorruptible he didn't say I'm going to throw it away and get the new one he said I'm going to the Bible says from Mortal to immortality from corruption to incorruption today you're looking at corruption but inside of you dwells incorruption inside of you dwells a body that God saw before the foundation of the world and he said you know what that Gary Atkins is going to believe what I say l now any I mean you didn't have to go to school to learn that it's just having faith it's just believing cuz I think listen we're so complacent we're lay out of sins we're complacent we're supposed to be but we're not supposed to be in God complacent we're complacent in our human flesh but in God we're not supposed to be complacent I think I truly think that we're waiting on something to happen brother Gary I think we're waiting on somebody to go right when the light's been on the whole time did God's light ever go out when he said let there be light that finished it for me amen let's sing a song but I put it back on our hour this is the mirror Aaron was preaching to himself this morning he wasn't just preaching to you he's

he had to handle handle it delicately and have the right way of doing it and he said God spoke to me for about 20 minutes or so just conversing back and forth and he said he walked me right through that thing and it couldn't have been no more perfect see he wouldn't have got that if that MP3 player would have worked God wanted to talk face to face with an old nasty rotten he don't mind me saying

different ways of doing things but it's God it's the same God it's the same Holy Ghost amen that Luther had Wesley had brother brandham had the same Holy Ghost just let's don't grieve it away from us so much to where death can rain in our members we we got to destroy that that's got to be taken away we may get into that maybe the next time we preach we may go a little deeper into what we're doing that how to cast that away because the Bible doesn't say grieve not the holy spirit of God and he'll never come back it says whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption but it's your choice whether you're going to go by a grave or where you going to go in a translation in a change okay and if you grieve him away he's not going to be here to change you in these atoms here he's already changed you inside you're already a new creation right created in the image of God just what he saw you before the foundation of the world but this outside God is the one we got to deal with but he gave us a word to do it with was that same quote the word promised before the foundation of the world that there's not another group coming amen there's not another Prophet coming there's not another Revelation or word coming the mystery of God will be finished in its end time through the voice of that seventh angel message well the voice he's gone but the voice is still here and the voice is in the Bride of Jesus Christ you love the Lord let's bow our heads dear heavenly father thank you Lord for today thank you Lord for the people here father that we've we've come to know and love and grew up with and and some we've known a long time some we've not known but Lord we'll have an eternity to spend with each other father we pray that what we've said today has not hurt anything Lord from you to grieve the holy spirit away from us Lord that it would it would be inviting that that the people would go home and and as their wheels turn and their car drives down the road Lord that they'll that they'll in their mind and in their heart that they'll take what's been said and and just truly say Lord you promised it and I believe it you've given me the word to do do it with you give us the time to do it with and you've give us the ability and now I just accept it Lord you that's what Abraham had to do he had to accept that he was going to have a child and then one day God changed their body and they had the child father we pray that you'd touch every sick person Lord bless the ones that are not with us father just touch mom at home Lord and just keep her and just be with each one you've already touched her body and I pray Lord that you would just be with us all Lord give us strength for this journey father we love you we thank you for your many blessings bless the little
