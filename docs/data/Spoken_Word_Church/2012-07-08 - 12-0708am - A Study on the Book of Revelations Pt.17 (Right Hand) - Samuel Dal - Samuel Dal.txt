to help the people and uh you know Richard went for his test this Richard her son-in-law went for his test uh there the other day and and they wound up and said everything was great they couldn't even hardly tell where that they had put him back together you know when they operated on him back G so we appreciate God doing his work cuz he said he would always do it amen so we're going to read from Revelations 1 and then we're going to read from First Peter 1 and then we'll read from Luke 10 amen so if I missed any other announcements we we just uh let our ignorance and all okay father we thank you we love you and we ask you that you would just guide each and every one of us in thine understanding give us of thy love and grace that we may walk in the light of your understanding in this day and time that we're living and to be ready against today because we believe that every day closer gets us closer to you just have your way forgive our sins cleanse us make us to walk in the light of Your Love Lord bless each one bless Wade there today as he's ministering brother Collins and just be with him Lord and just be with us here that we may see you because that's our desire we love you and we thank you we just ask you to have your way keep us in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 we've been reading this now for quite a while but we just keep kind of adding a few scriptures in to give us understanding says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel un to his servant John who by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand so we believe the time being here right now we go to First Peter um 1:9 receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired and search diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching what are what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them to signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should be that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto them but unto us they did Minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the Angels desire desire to look into wherefore G up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ now we'll go to Luke to just tie end the message may be this afternoon but we'll try to to get into it Luke 1 verse 19 now let's read this all together okay everybody ready behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you amen you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word we thank you for praying about our shoulder it's a whole lot better I can get my arm on up a little bit sometimes it's kind of rough getting the coat on and off and boy had to come in to help me cuz once you try to get one arm in it do work getting the other one but it's coming it's working out all right I just took a little tumble the other day when during the rain and working and all in a hurry and kind of stretch things out of the place but thank God for the Healer he is that healer now that's right we have been studying in for some while now this is message number 17 and we've been talking about or taking a study on the Book of Revelations leading up to chapter 5 which would be the basis of what we were wanting to come to or to see you know to understand so we went through uh those things in Revelations 1 and then going through seeing the the one in the midst of the seven golden Candlestick like under the son of man G about the pouch with a golden girdle and seeing that that was bride form and then we made our statement that we made basically ever service is that if you want to find yourself go in the Book of Revelations because that is the book to find yourself in it is the book personally to you it's your day it's your hour your time is is there to understand the time to understand all right see see then you know as I've always said if I was taking one book and they said you can't have but one book out of the Bible what do you want we're going to isolate you we'll give you the Book of Revelations see since the prophet has come and spoke to us and the symbols are broken and we can understand and read then we don't have any trouble uh being able to comprehend The Book of Revelations you know CU we were trying to figure it out on our own and we couldn't do it and and neither could the prophet of God until God broke it unto him to reveal the word but thank God for uh the prophet coming to bring us the message all right and see then I've told you then that in the Book of Revelations you find in the writings of the Gospel it's writing about Matthew Mark Luke and John it's it's telling about Jesus Christ and what went on on Earth and during the time and things and then the uh Paul Peter James John uh the writers of what we call the New Testament uh then they were writing about their revelation of Jesus Christ and putting that in form to where that we would have it to understand all right then we would find then a vast gap between that period of time and the end time and and we know that God would uh always like a breach comes or gap between something but he has always been gracious to fill in that area to where that we can understand so then he we we looked at it as the first chapter of Revelations filling in the Gap from what the writings of what the apostles were saying and then I told you and I keep telling you to read the book of Revelations and in that book of Revelations you never find Jesus Christ by himself he's always revealing himself either to or right there with but it's basically in the Bride of Jesus Jesus Christ are with the bride of Jesus Christ you know in in in the Book of Revelation so that's a wonderful book to me that's why I love to read it then I can see myself sitting there and and seeing those things and then we we went up as John was to type the Rapture in chapter 4 and seeing the open door and the things that was in Revelations 4 taking it kind of verse by verse to express those things of Revelations 4 and seeing that there was a throne set in heaven and and one set on the throne we went through covering then what the prophet had to say about that throne and how it came into being and and that Throne brother R says was the father's Throne the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right see then it would have to have if it's going to be setting dire is going to have to be a time on Earth that that transpires uh you can read in the seals and the things of six seal there's going to be a tribulation period right the six seal covers that part well you know what there has to be a time on Earth that that will take place you agree see that that that's the point I've been trying to get you to look at that you know see if you can look up there and see a throne and one sitting on the throne and see a Rapture and see the bride already there sitting with him on the on the throne then there must be here on Earth something that has taken place Amen to be able to match that kind of you know like I've always tried to get you to see matching pieces that's why when Martin Luther see when he brought the message of the just shall live by faith then once he brought that message his life would be very short because that he you know that was all he was to bring he wasn't to bring anymore now he preached a lot of things right but that message of the just shall live by faith well here come John Wesley see coming along with sanctification and then when he does then you know he would be shortlived because that would have that was all he had then he come zusa Street with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts being restored and that would be short live because there was not anything else to take place in that time but then in the end time the prophet was to come to bring us to message and see then we've been what 40 something years now in the the a lot of us in that amount of time even studying the message that has been brought unto us see then we we've got a vast time here I know the prophet called it a short time because it is that's right see some of the Ages was real long but this one is going to be real short why because it's going to end in a Rapture but now if we can look there and read that and see ourselves dire the sitting on the throne in in heaven and all then we've got to realize that the Throne of God must start in the heart of man by the baptism of the Holy Ghost right and be able to manifest here on Earth to match what's there that's right all right when it does we're going there Luther and them had to go by the grave cuz it was not anymore for them to bring that's right all right see Luther couldn't bring Wesley's message so there was no way you know for him to go on so he had to go by the grave but see you and I are not to go by the grave I believe somebody's going to be changed twinkl ey and why can't I believe that I'm one of them I've been around here a long time and I surely have enjoyed being here but I want to get out of here I want to be changed I want to be here when that takes place you know and and doing that part and even if I miss it then I'll get me a ticket and go to Israel cuz I'll get to see God in action right right but see I don't imp plan missing it but if I do just you just make on brother Dale's gone to Israel because I want to see God in action that's always been my desire my thoughts and all is to see God made manifest among his people all right and now see in this hour we're seeing those things then we got to Revelations 5 all right we took Revelations 4 basically verse by verse but then we came over into Revelations 5 and picking up in Revelation 5 and seeing that and let's just read this because we've been through it but let's read it again because I love it go ahead and pull up the the uh quotes that are supposed to be quoted it'll be number two of the number one and number two all right look what brother randam has to say about these things this is taking Revelation CH 5 part 2 uh 61618 paragraph 6 79 and 80 all right we find out then that this first beginning of the chapter that we find the fifth chapter is just a TI Block it's a diamond hitch in other words tying together it is a word we would use called breach and if you'll go back to the breach you'll find brother random referring basically to chapter 5 in the breach and just read it you know and and then he's telling all of the things that's happening and what will take place all right he said A diamond hit that ties the last part of the church age of the third chapter the fourth chapter tells us what John was taken up into heaven and the fifth chapter watch it is preparing for these now what the fifth chapter is of preparing now we were talking about this in the Bible Study last night and I said like a gap there a breach see there there's many places in the Bible that there's a breach but now breach is it just mean a gap right right all right that's not very valuable unless you're able to get across right I mean you go down and you see a river and it's 100t wide and 20t deep well you don't want to step out and start Treading Water I don't think you know but you need something to get across so you search for a bridge right all right so that's the way God does things he makes a bridge in there and just to cut it short of what we were talking about see then when when it comes up to the sixth chapter of Revelations brother rown covers the The Sixth Seal and the ending of it and when he comes to the seventh seal you'll notice it goes six at the end of chapter 6 and then it goes to 81 is the seventh seal and brother around said now this is all we have to go on what the seventh chap chapter so he preached a message about the seventh chapter to build it over see to make a bridge then he could go to chapter to Revelations you know on the seventh seal and start speaking of it then that's what he's saying here now we need something you and I need something to be able to understand so John is writing this to us about us and sending it we need something to be able to understand now here's our problem but brother Dale brother randam has already preached it amen but that don't mean we have it that's right right your computer's got it if that's the way it works it can quote it back to you and everything else even correct the spelling if you need to right but it don't mean it's right you know it don't mean that what I mean it don't mean it's it it's got to be revealed that's right everybody say can't you just look back there and see in 1963 when the Lord came well that's right I agree with you he came to brother R that's right right he came to brother Brown on see then you say well we got it cuz it came that's a good badst Doctrine that's right now I come from there and I know their Doctrine all right the Baptist say I got the hold Holy Ghost because it came on the day of Pentecost are you listening they say they've got it because it came on the day of Pentecost they don't say they've got it because it's an experience in their heart of the same thing of Pentecost they say we got it cuz it come out well is that the way we are in the message brother R said something what I say I'm not saying he's coming brother R said I'm saying he's here well he's here brother R said he was that's good oh yeah but where's he at all right see we I'm just trying to be serious about the situation because we had 40 something years to run around hor and argue with each other right is that what the children of Israel done 40 years round and around one mountain that's right you pretty pretty bad wouldn't it and you can say boy I know that mountain you remember there I sat down yesterday and I Dro that out and I'm know where that tree is that tree is and that heel is and that thing see that's the way we do with the message oh we know all about it but has it been revealed all right now do you understand what I'm saying yes the fifth chapter is a preparing yes all right now we'll read that on further on in a second brother brandom had to have a preparation the seals wasn't opened in 33 right why like I said Wednesday brother R said it took him 30 something years before he could even preach the statue of perfect man now that's what he said well see then you couldn't the seals couldn't break brother around tried to preach the seals in his early ministry right yes and he had white horse rider is the Holy Ghost right come on but see when God opened the seals then he saw where the truth was right all right now in doing that he had to have a foundation or or a preparation or a breach you know something to be able to come across so brother randam is in his studies he's back here in 61 and he's getting ready and he's studying are the opening of the seals that's right amen and as he's doing it a foundation must be there that's why I keep saying it cuz I mean it I'm serious I've always said this people say brother rown was wrong in his early Ministry but right after the seals broke well I want you to come show me that that's right you're quoting what somebody says that don't have one eye and high sense that's what Brother Don rdle used to say I'll quote him he said anybody with one ey in high sense s to know that ain't right but you see church we want to look at something and say we're here well where we at all let's go ahead and pull it back up to where we can read a little bit because it's a preparation the fifth chapter is not a verse by verse we'll read that he said it's a scene yes and you go down to the movie or you go down especially to a play and they open the curtain that's what you call a scene right all right that goes through so much so many actors are on stage and playing out their parts but then you close the curtain right and then you got another scene well I brother around me saying now what if it's a scene then we need to know what the scene is about that's right so look what he says this the Diamond hits to the lik you know the fourth chapter tells what John was taking up into heaven and the fifth chapter is preparing for these where we went through the seven Church ages now what then John's lifted up in the fourth chapter now this is his preparation right and the fifth chapter is just setting a scene for the opening of The Seven Seals no want see at this time he doesn't know what the seals are right come on I wasn't the one that wrote the book and they put it out so we order they ought to read their own book if nothing else everybody El to brother around even when he preached the breach he preached what God in Simplicity and preached the breach he said I do not know what the first seal is oh yeah he knowed all about then he lied I don't have no problem saying that he said he didn't that's when he preached the first seal he said I don't know what the second third fourth F all right that's sensible that's plain language all right but look what he's saying see here he doesn't know about it he doesn't know what it is but he knows this is the preparing you remember when he got over to the Daniel 70 weeks yes he said if we don't get this out of the way yes we won't be able to understand the seals that's right so we had to get it out of the way he had to preach it that's right right well people just go Haywire all about it but in the Daniel 70 weeks he said if you don't understand the Daniel 7 we he said you can't understand the seal amen I didn't write the book that's right I didn't make the quote but I believe it but everybody now they just byass everything oh yeah I know all about the seal that's white horse rider Antichrist you boy we got it straight down amen but clar Lin taught that before brother random ever come along that's right they don't make clar Lin the prophet that's right it made him having one thing right right right but he probably had everything else messed up he still a trinitarian cuz that's what he was back there all right but look what he's saying John's lifted up this is setting a scene for the opening of The Seven Seals just as he did in the first chapter Opening way the way for the church ages first chapter opening away what is the thing in the first chapter there he stands in the seven golden candles he's to look upon as Jasper and sarden stone that's putting chapter one and chapter 4 because chapter four is where you bringing the sard stone in the and get it all right and he's preparing for the those seven Church ages see the chapter one was preparing for the seven Church ages now what's taking place now he's preparing for the opening of those seals of redemption see that's what the fifth chapter is that's the reason I kind of read it and you just take it from there and talk on it and give the other parts of the scripture is because it isn't verse by verse something that's happening read is preparing for something to happen a lot of difference in that right yes come on and if you get to preparation right then you're just you're ready for it then and that's the way it is by the faith or anything else it's a preparation for the opening of the seals oh yeah the opening of this book that we'll read in a minute because chapter 4 doesn't talk about a book talks about a throne one sitting on the throne 24 Elders rainbow round about The Throne Etc but it doesn't we're going to read Revelation 5 in just a minute and then we'll start our point but in Revelations 5 you see one sitting on the throne with a book in his hand all right now we've got to understand that yes the fifth chapter now is going to be our basis to understand amen that's why he said I don't take it this now he explained verse by verse but he said I'm trying to get you to see a scene now the scene is in heaven you remember that was where they messed up and or where brother around even messed up himself and when they asked him about it or he was talking about the fifth chapter and he said that was israelit after the Rapture then he said hold it something went wrong he said you remember that was the question something went wrong he said he said now hold it a minute said you know somebody told him which was a brother erson told him said read your question or your scripture over he said that is the Bride of Jesus Christ already in glory he said you see where I would have missed that huh now if we go up in Revelations 4:1 the prophet said it and not seen to Revelations 19 then the seals evidently must be to Israel right I've preached that for 40 something years so I don't have to worry about it the opening of the seals is to you and I amen cuz he he said Abraham I can't withhold anything from you I'm going to show you the beginning and the ending right it can't be withholding it's got to be he's got to give it so we get to Revelation right now come on get in your questions and answers of the seals they ask brother randam does the man of sin sitting in the temple of God showing himself to be God that f bu the first seal he said yes the only question he got on the seals and he answered it with a simple yes because I imagine the man's heart was in his stomach along at that time because all they could do in the opening of the seals and he announced it he said these are to be things about the seals and and they wanted to know questions like should a woman wear panty holes or you know should he wear this or should he wear uh uh things to go to bed you know or some kind or or what about Father Son and Holy Ghost brother Brown don't you think we're to be baptized Father Son and Holy Ghost and don't you think he was brokenhearted after preaching the whole week am now I wasn't the man that made the statement as I was saying a while ago you say brother Brown said it we got it well you know there is a statement he send the questions and answers he says it's gone from you or either s SE he said it's gone from you and there's no way for you to know it now that's what he said read your book if you don't come to my office I'd be glad to run it off for you he said it's gone from you there's no way for you to know it but said something to happen right around the coming of the Lord don't you think Lord to be somewhere around the coming of the Lord now to show you that we're not trying because we're trying to stay we're going to try to stay with the right hand point this morning and not deal with a book now we're going this afternoon if we get there but we find in Revelations 5 one sitting on the throne all right with a book in his right hand all right now I'll get to it this afternoon more because I don't want to spend much time on it this morning but what kind of a book is that it is certainly not a book like we read because this was back before this form of books came into being all right right that's right amen it was Scrolls and things like that right amen all right but really what kind of a book was it the book in the hand of the one sitting on the throne all right go ahead now where I wrote on start here because I was going to dis quote those be number one start here which is e 63 318 the first seal paragraph 12 now as we study this chapter referring different places even to the old and the New Testament lot because the entire book is the revelation of Jesus Christ you said we know that brother Dale why would you want to keep emphasizing that BL it BL it your Prophet kept emphasizing it that's right why can't I right and just say what he says amen see so what is the entire book what is the book in the hand of the one sitting on the throne we'll get this afternoon more on it but what is it it's the book of redemption right you can argue whether it's this or whether it's that but it's the book of redemption it's the book of the revelation of Jesus Christ and like I told them last night if you would follow something the prophet done he cut short on the seventh seal remember and some didn't even know it last night until I mentioned it a lot of people don't know that brother brandom when he preached the original seventh seal that night he went home and got to thinking about it the next next day he got together before they would release any tapes and he preached called the comments and he withheld part of the original seventh seal now I'll show you in the seal book we had him last night brother Jo run it far you need to look at it he put out comments all right those comment stayed until the next year after he died in after 6 I would come out in ' 66 the brandom foundation voted to release the original seventh seal lot of people don't even know that but it's right there in your seal book it even gives you the page number where it starts and stops but see in the original Seven seal you look at it and really there's only two folds that he's even speaking of you read your book but a short time after the any priest of message called Christ is the mystery of God reveal he said if you miss it in the seals he didn't say go back and read them again or hear the text read the book he said read Christ Minster he said if you miss it in the seals come back to this message because in that message he preached a three-fold revelation right and he said it was the seventh seal page 16117 of Christ of mystery all right now you say well what's that got to do what we're talking about now because it's a complete revelation of Jesus Christ so that third fold that everybody thinks is some kind of a great big I don't know what you'd say they think it is because that's the way people's minds are it would have to be something about the Revel of Jesus Christ right because that's all the book reveals right that's all that's in the book amen no Brother D it's a secret mystery yeah I know all about it they make it a great secret mystery right till some of them says that that great secret mystery under that seventh seal is polygamy and they can have all the wives they want I never did understand cuz I never heard him preach that all the women could have all the husband they wanted I never did read that way it were always the men could have all the wives they wanted the great mystery secret is the Little Hen the rooster with a whole lot of little H running around you know well if that's what it is mankind had that a long time ago right that's not what it is it's a revelation of Jesus Christ all right pull up the next one then cuz that's what I want to go to just keep going on down did we finish that one all right the old and the New Testament is revelation of it's God's revelation God revealing himself in the book healing himself through Christ in the book and Christ is the revelation of God he come to reveal God because he and God were the same God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and otherwise you'd never know just what God was until he revealed himself through Christ that's right now that's your Prophet statement now you know I got this great you going to see him in Christ first that's right I see him in myself then I see him in Christ no no no you're backwards I'm sorry you missed the whole story you you're going to see him in Christ then you can see him in yourself because my Bible says it's Christ in you so Christ had to come first and then be in you right all right it's revealing himself through Christ in the book and Christ is the revelation of God he come to reveal God because he and God were the same God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and otherwise you'd never know just what God was until he revealed himself through Christ then you can see I used to think now here's your Prophet than about oh that brother he come in there he understood Jesus Christ all the way through his life now he was a prophet bless him and he never was a trinitarian come on come on but look what he said I used to think years ago that maybe God was angry with me but Christ was love me come to find out it's the same person see and Christ is the very Heart Of God so the book is a revelation of Jesus Christ who does it reveal go to number two it's rising the sun paragraph 308 65418 morning he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals for the entire for the whole word of God is Christ and Christ is the seals that was opened what is the opening of the seals then revealing Christ I like that you notice brother R didn't preach Jesus was the mystery of God revealed that's right you missed your title he preached Christ as a mystery of godv I believe it's page 74 Christ of mystery where the bride I've got it in either this afternoon or somewhere he said the bride is part of the Myster amen you know what brother around says God is not complete without you I got those quotes laying on today waiting for a time we've been down to here before yes but listen he is those seals for the word of God is Christ now the word of God is Christ okay brother R said if you read the book and don't see Christ in every verse now he didn't say Jesus he said Christ in every verse he said read it again you missed something that's right so when it says so and so we got so and so and so and so we got so and so and so and so we got so and so and so and an hour later you're still reading so and so we got so and so that's talking about Christ or somewhere in there is a lineage you'll find 14 from here to here 14 from here to here Etc he lays it down listen church then what are we seeing now remember what I said the prophet said the fifth chapter was a preparation for the opening of the seal a foundation setting a stage filling up the gap that we were talking about between here and there bringing it forth and showing Jesus Christ standing there not like a brother parent ten said his people said he stood in in that gap for them well brother R don't stand in that gap for me that's right Jesus Christ stands in that Gap now he used brother Brown amen right he used brother Brown to bring the message but brother around didn't stand in the Gap he can't be Jesus Christ now without him we wouldn't have no way to get over the Gap that's right that's right but just make sure you keep it right he said if you make me Jesus Christ you make me Antichrist that's his words but now we're talking about a foundation a preparation and getting things ready what greater Foundation could there be than the word of God I like what the old colored brother said he said I I'd rather be standing on the word then stand it in heaven he said because the Bible says the word says Heaven and Earth will pass away but the word of God abideth forever so all right now let's get a foundation then that's what I was trying to do Wednesday night and I I didn't couldn't leave it so we just have to stay with that part all right look the next one which is do you now believe 1953 116 E8 now the very way that I have faith is God in God is first by his word faith is a revelation right all right so deal with that keep that in your mind in a minute maybe if I don't mention it you you'll hold that coin and if of any Vision or any person would speak anything that was contrary to the word what does he say then don't hear it this is the fundamental Foundation of all God has said into to his church what the word is and every person's Faith must be built sovereignly upon the Bible must be built sovereignty on the Bible the only foundation that we have so how are we're going to get across this from Revelations 4 to Revelations six well I'm back to that again right around and said it but has it been revealed to you that's right what revealed see we're looking for secret Mysteries some canalyzing something right now I just laid the foundation of showing you exactly what I'm talking about that's right amen the seals the entire Bible is a revelation of Jesus Christ so then there must be something about Jesus Christ that we need to know that's right now is it true that brother Bram always preached one true and living God and that Christ was that God yes then why did he preach a message over after the seal was broke and called it Christ as a mystery he must have seen more about Christ right there must have been something about Christ that wasn't being made known just like I read down there he said I used to think that God hated me and Jesus loved me until it was revealed in other words that they're the same person now this your Prophet there with growth development through his his understanding right so what are we trying to do lot of people say well brother all brother Dale is just word word word word word word well what are you what I said I like about what Brother Joseph was to write to him hadn't heard any more about it about the when the man up there said you know the the movie or the people up there in that Kentucky where they were talking about brother brandom and the guy was going through and all the things you've heard about it said did this are they still just yeah they're just listening them same old 1200 term tapes over and over Joseph wrote him back and was least it's been his comments it said we've been reading the same Bible for 2,000 years over and over that's a good point you can argue all you want to about anybody just tell them what the word says see a foundation all right look at the next one this is from the message looking for Jesus 54 uh 222 uh 228 excuse me evening E15 now the ministers usually here in it now the ministers usually here is the basis and Foundation of all Christendom it lays right here in the Bible anything outside of that is untrue that's that's right it has to be based on thus sayth the Lord amen what's going to carry us across what's going to fill in any gap for us to understand is going to have to be the word that's right amen amen it can't be our ideas and thoughts they've run the wild field of that and you know it that's right cuz they've had all kind of they saying polygamy they've had all kind I'm the guy to take over I'm supposed to be supposed to be an Indian supposed to be this one supposed to be over here supposed to be over there you got to follow this well you know what God is just letting all that down that's right right that's right he just letting all of them that was running the field just die off cuz it ain't no good when it comes to a battle anyway come on in the natural you don't if we went to war today you think they would take me over there they wouldn't even spend time putting me in an airplane to help them fight and I'm too old and fat I'd be a drudgery well I'm not making fun of a lot of people God showed me years ago there'd be a lot of people in this message die before the Rapture would come and that ain't no new thing said to you right you see them dying off now and just leaving the scene you see it's getting too old I there's one fell here in the United States lives 100 114 years old I think the oldest person well I still got I still got about 44 years 42 years to go then you know so don't just get in your mind play toys with it so be real in what you're doing look at the next one the curtain of time 1955 uh 302 paragraph 47 and went ahead and he said he started Jesus never started to argue with them or talking he said watch what he did went straight to the word that's it brother the word of God that's the basis and Foundation of all salvation and healing lays in the word watch you not in your feelings not what you think about it but what God has said about it amen oh I wish I could take a have a tack and I could tack that in your heart where it would never get loose now what could be said any more than that a foundation the foundation of all things the next one number six what is it statue of a perfect man notice you must be born again and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith that's right so you see my on my chart here I got the very Foundation faith is the foundation of all of it for without faith it's impossible to believe God he that cometh to God must believe that he is in the reward of those that diligently seek him see he must be and when you're a skeptic of the Bible when you're skeptic of the word being right you just might as well stay back until first you believe I think it's about time to believe if it ain't what are we doing what are what are we doing now pull up Revelations 51 and let's get started we'll go for just a little while and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne the book WR within and on the back side seal with Seven Seals now I know I'm hateful sarcastic arrogant I know that I'm sorry but ever since I've been in the message I've heard very few people preaching about the one on the throne the book in his hand they're always trying to figure out that writing on the inside and on the backside now you know that's true right there's been all kind of versions put out of what that meant amen riding on the inside and riding on the outside seal with seven seals instead of getting the foundation of the one on the throne and the book in the hand to be able to understand is trying to figure out something that they know nothing about so a brother gets his idea and he runs with it and then everybody wants to follow after that and then after a while they see that kind of crumble and they float back you know and you see him another one comes up and another young fell gets really anointings and gets to go and everybody wants to run with him you know what I've always told you just let them run that's right don't argue with him cuz they going to run out and settle down because it's like there when Jesus was there and you remember who was it g you said noway a fell rose up over here and let about 400 out you under and said you know after a while it all peted out you know fell away and so I suggest what we do is leave this man alone because if it's not right it's going to be like that that's right right but if it is right we're going to be fighting against God right you had a good point didn't he brother around said because of his stand he would not he is did not never record of him receiving the Holy Ghost him in Nicodemus or G but he said they would be given eternal life because of their stand right there is a good stand let's just leave it alone if it be anything it'll survive but if not it'll come to not well that's what you do with all these doctrines and ideas and thoughts right you know I was curious and I ran in they're on the computer to you see how many times it speaks of right hand cuz that's what we're going to talk about we're not going to talk about the book this afternoon or maybe Wednesday No but uh we're going to talk about the right hand oh we know all about right hand's power well unless some maybe doesn't know that maybe they haven't seen it I'll run it in to see how many times it says right hand in the Bible and and I know what it could be meaning different things in different version whatever and just somebody right hand he took with his right hand and all but right hand is mentioned 6 161 times in the Bible what is your Prophet keep emphasizing right hand right hand sure we know it's power and authority right yes but if you ever just went true just a little bit so we'll do this for a minute and then we'll quit go ahead Brothers they got all these scriptures lined up that we can go one after the other and come down they can put them all up at once or one at a time now when Jesus Christ was here on Earth he died and paid the price and where'd he go according to Second Peter this is where Peter said he went who has gone into heaven and is on the right hand of God angels and authorities and Powers being made subject unto him all right do we know where he went to by the Bible get the next one the next one was speaking Hebrews 10 and 12 but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God so we know where he went keep on going Hebrews 8 And1 now the things which we have spoken this is the sum you know what sum means you're you're getting everything you bring it all together we have such a high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens so it's right hand of God right hand of Throne of majesty so it's evident in the same place you follow that look at the next one who being the brightness Hebrews 1 and3 of his glory and express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself Pur our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high all right you connected the hand it has to be then the right hand of God would have to be the right hand of majesty the Throne all right now Colossians 3: 1 if he didn't be risen with Christ seek those things which are above were Christ Christ sth on the right hand of God now on the right hand of God in the original thought that we would bring was when Jesus would resurrect he would sit on the throne now we're calling it The Christ look at mark 16- 19 they saw him go here right so then after the Lord had spoken to them he was received up into heaven and sit on the right hand of God do we know where he went to they saw him go there Jesus referred to this position in Matthew 2664 Jesus Sith unto them thou has said nevertheless I say unto you here after shall you see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the Clouds Of Heaven it was spoken of according to Mark 12 and 36 where David said by the Holy Ghost the Lord said to my Lord sit down on my right hand hand till I make thine enemies thy foottoo that was David back in the Psalms right prophesying of it stepen actually saw what Jesus said Jesus said you'll see the son of man in at your right hand Steven at his crucifixion acts 75556 but he being full of the Holy Ghost looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of God and said behold I see the heavens open and the son of man standing on the right hand of God Steven saw it Paul spoke of it Romans 8 and 34 who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yeah brother that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us Ephesians 1 and 20 which he WR in Christ when he raised him from the dead who did it God raised him and set him at his own right hand in the Heavenly places acts 5:31 Him hath God exalted with his right hand are you reading yes all the others been going to the right hand or on the right hand or whatever how did Jesus get to where he was at him ha God exalted with his right hand to be a prince and savior to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins Acts 2 and33 therefore being by the right hand of God exalted in having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost he has shed forth this which he now see and hear are you listening Hebrews 12 and 2 looking under Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who far the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God there's a lot more in it if you want to read just run in right hand but you see we want to look at right hand as being will yeah he was sitting on the right hand now you know what that was with all of us before we heard the message right God had a great big old hand and Jesus was sitting on it so we got the Trinity father's on the throne and Jesus is sitting on his hands and the Holy Ghost is down here in the church upon Earth so we got a good Trinity right well now we might have had it a little different version right you know you know what I'm saying we might not have thought that but as I told you when brother Mo asked me what I believed about God I said that Baptist Doctrine see as one true and living God that's their basis but to explain it he said now explain it I said God in three persons Blessed Trinity he said you Trinity just like the rest of them boy I didn't get mad stomp out Feud and wouldn't talk to him no more I said would you explain yourself sir he said person to personality personality is an individual individual is a person so now if you got them three persons you're just as Trinity as anybody else I've told you before it didn't take me No 5 minutes it didn't take no nothing I looked at him and I said I don't believe that no more that's what I said cuz I didn't why because he done nail my hide to the wall there was nowhere I could go I had enough sense to know that I could have quoted the father son Holy Ghost no I knew better do that CU I talking to a man that could quote faster than I could and I was glad of it that man knew 3/4 of the Bible by memory and I'd always go when I'd be looking for scripture I just go over and say brother Mo where the scripture says so and so and so and so he just rattled it off but you see we think we're smart you can't prove me there ain't no Trinity I get to heaven if they ain't three Thrones and three Gods I'll leave you ain't never heard that one that's what people say right all right this for a second maybe we can bring this message to part of a close anyway what is the right hand I can give you the quotes go ahead and pull it up that can read it brother Joe and brother Anderson and you know you can read some of it but you ought to know these quotes by heart the right hand is not that God is got a big old right hand right and it's not one person sitting here another person sitting here cuz we already went to it there Wednesday night last Sunday that brother R said he come and took the book climbed up on the throne and sat down well now you got the father on the throne and the son on the throne if you got two persons but if you got one you got the opening of the word revealing of one true Living God all right so then what we do we look at it he said his right hand means power he says for instance like if you know if they had full sway of the church and brother Neville will come along you know and he'd hand it over to him in other words and know he said he's my right hand we talk about the right hand that's reason I gave you we sitting on the right hand but he was exalted by the right hand see right hand means power and authority h amen go ahead to the next one I won't read them so you can just go down through there and read them off you set right hand not God has a right hand that somebody's sitting on right hand means power and authority got the authority of everything in heaven and in Earth you remember that after his resurrection we get to it this afternoon he said all power is given unto me in heaven and earth her right you know what brother said about that he said if that be true and he's wri in his statement he said then if you got another God he ain't got no power I love the way he just talk plain you know you can't argue that point a theologian he can fuss and scream and holler of the quotes but he can't argue a simple little point he ain't got sense enough to become simple the prophet said then your God is powerless cuz Jesus said all power is given unto me amen and you know he never said that until after his death bur and Resurrection right right you didn't say it when he was here in life right hand means power I'll just cut off a lot of this and come right back to the point right hand means power and authority so then if you got Jesus having power and God having power now while Jesus would here alive on Earth there was things he didn't know you agree do you need these quotes brother said he didn't know his future work in the church until after his death bur and Resurrection come to John on patas all right you need these quotes be glad to again but see Jesus then didn't have all power when he was on earth right I'm talking about Force death bural and Resurrection you said well you better paddle in a hurry you're caught no I ain't caught I love it in deep water see because Jesus said I do nothing until my father shows me that's right amen so you going to paddle back out yourself now cuz I'm out of the water stand waiting on you I don't mean that sarcastically I just mean it's a truth see people think they're smart in the word but do just don't get caught in the word maybe I'm just a good old Baptist but you know what brother Brown said about him he said that good old Baptist will tear you apart with the word he says you better know what you're talking about see because we read the Bible didn't read everything else all maybe that's all I am today what are you see so Jesus when he was here on Earth and watch the power and authority he had the authority invested of him of the father right now you agree with that I mean had to power invested to it yes all right didn't know everything didn't you know but you know what while he was here that's where we read in Luke there when we started he said I give you power over serpents Etc and even the power of the enemy [Music] right you see he said and I can show you the quotes where he said there's where the church fails because they don't believe that they don't believe that they have power remember is what he gives us we don't have any power of our own that's where we tried to work that up and make it work and it don't do it it's what he gives us Jesus never credited power of his own that's right he credited power of the father but you see when he received all the power then where's his power now right let lay here if you'd like to read them where brother around and said you see there were those stars in his right hand he said those were the messengers of the age he said they were the voice and power of God well if they're there then we're there right why can't you see what we are church I believe it if all power in Heaven and Earth was given unto him and he gave us that same power according to my Bible that I read I read where it says that we're co-equal with him what the Bible say Co equal that's right so whatever he has I have right I told him at work one day down there I said my father runs a cattle on a thousand heill and said if he was hungry he wouldn't ask you for anything to eat there's a boy he come here he called his gu said tell him about your father that's my father but you see we just don't believe it we read it but we don't believe it now I'm trying to illustrate so you remember where that we were talking a while ago that everybody thinks brother Brandon said it and I got it well you know he said that every Born Again believer taking the word of God upon his lips was deity speaking amen believe yes do you believe that yes amen like we was talking about the other week there about the everybody wants to make the combat Beast they say the man you know the lon the ox the man all that was God in the people but when it come to the lights when the Eagles brother random brother random all by yourself and then we got an eagle age out here that everybody's even Sinners put Eagles on their houses and their thing you go in a store to to buy something go in a novelty store and you see Eagles all over the place right brother random said when the Eagles plural come you need that quote he said when the Eagles plural appear I thought we believe we little eets right I thought we believe we were little Messiah but do we believe that God has made us remember the Bible said it is he that has made us not we ourselves we are his people she so it's what he's made us he said I give you all power over every enemy the Bible said there's no weapon formed that can conquer you Ain can drop a bomb right in this building it can explode and not hurt a one in here that's right that's right that's amen but see do we believe that now that's what we're scared of we're afraid to step out of course then comes up the thing see but brother Dale we don't see much going on at L either but well that's the ones I'm talking about that's our problems we're Lula we're not everywhere else right what it goes on everywhere else no business of mine we're Lula but now that ain't the end of the story people don't like it but we have it on record the dead raised sick of all forms being healed right people with cancer totally gone right rain coming in a dry spell amen it's on record but see even to you as Believers that have been here and seen those things looking at a man that told you medically my blood type has been changed from a positive to a negative medically proven right great doctor told me said I'll take your kneecaps off cuz they wore out that's about 30 years ago I still got him Lord amen that's why when they come in and told me when they run all that and I had that growth under here and they took it out they come in there and told me and they said you got leukemia said so what and didn't scare you nope look said so what we can give you this I said you won't give me no chemo right now I'm not against people taking it yourself you take it if you want to I am not teaching not to take it I have never done that but I said you're not going to give me any I said anything else you got kind of help me that's all right but I ain't going to be no good I'm going you'll see well when they run their finalities of the test you know what they come back in and said said you got the kind of leukemia cuz it was a week or so before they told me said you got the kind of leukemia you won't die from you'll die with it because there's two different kinds of leukemia well I don't care you know what do I care I know who the healer is right I fell the other day I said Lord just take care of this Lord Joe said I never know you failed said you work so hard I believe in the Healer I believe in your prayers because in your prayers is the power of God yes amen when are we going to believe believe the power of God is now in the bride of Christ when are we going to accept that and quit playing around if brother brandom was here now you'd see great things yes amen but why can't we believe in the same God that brother R Ser to heal us and Deliver Us and save us see the bride now is the power of God on Earth that's right yes where do we get into where that lamb comes from cuz it's got seven horns and seven eyes but the r said it comes from the church ages that's right right hand is power and authority and God has given us that yes take up deadly serpents drank deadly things sister up north up there just walked by one day where there was like a smoke was coming out and you know it just went into her lungs and just ru them I don't know where she's still alive I don't really know do you don't know the water you drink the air you breathe the things you better be praying because everything what about that girl the other day that what what did she do was a simple thing and she wound up with the disease that just her body is just they had to take parts off because it just started right run around and see it it'll come a time the cancer would just be like a toothache that's right amen do we better be under the blood folks and believe in it but would it offend you if I made this life statement if what I said is true then and Jesus said all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me and that we're co-equal that whatever he has I have right then to the Bride of Jesus Christ Christ all the powers in Heaven and Earth is at your disposal that's right you know I remember when I was in school that they you know we had used to have grain Ries filled up with with the grain and everything enough to feed our Nations for years and years and years and you know one Ambassador went to Russia and gave it to him you know they had to keep his word cuz he was an ambassador we send an ambassador to one of these countries and they go over there and say it we got to do it because that full authority of the United States is behind that Ambassador all Heaven is behind us got a quote in here where brother said it's behind us backing us up we're ambassadors for Jesus Christ let's stand come on musician think on these things power and authority the right hand right hand of God the Bible says we're saved by his right hand exalted by his right hand all his power and authority given unto you and I but are we afraid to step out on are we afraid to just say it and believe it you know what we do well I I don't want to say that I'm Healed when I'm really still sick I'd be lying you ain't nothing but a born liar my Bible says I'm Healed yes amen you mean I can't say what God says he says I'm Healed but see we say but but no I don't want to say if if this growth go away I'll go tell everybody it ain't going to go away you better go have it operated on CU it ain't going to go away with that attitude but if you look right straight at it life when that doctor said I'll take your kneecap off I looked at him and laughed said you ain't going to take my kneecap off he looked back and he laughed I loved it he was a good old man come in there this is a special is this wasn't this regular doctor he come in there with old paint all over him he I reckon he' been out painting and doing something he had paint on his shoe I looked at him I said hey you're the kind of doctor I like you know he just laughed he said I'll take them off Sam I said you won't do it see why can't we just stand on God's word go ahead brother 592 in spiral yes 592 in the spir book anybody have a name yes let's talk about Jesus the King of Kings is the of anybody have a I am the way the lifeus more and brother's got a hurt in his knees he's ever had one so let's just pray and believe and just accept What God Says now God says he's healed so we say he so now think about it if he was standing here what would he do what did he do when he's here he lay hands on pray for the now what's the difference I say he's greater here than he was there because he's got to put up with all the stuff that's around us right so let's believe father we condemn this this of our brother's need we had these pains and things we sympathized with but that w't healing but faith in a living God will change all things so now we just lay hands on just likeing heart Jus anybody else what about it are you afraid are you afraid to step out say Lord I believe my brother got hurt in we thank you in Jesus anybody else just come and let see like I
