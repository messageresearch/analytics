[1:49] those of you from tennessee
[1:50] sorry that's just where you live it's on
[1:52] who you know it's on where you live
[1:54] so now we're going we're going to talk
[1:56] about grace again
[1:58] and i was thinking about this this
[2:00] morning or this afternoon yesterday
[2:01] afternoon and this morning
[2:04] when i talked when i tell you that you
[2:06] know grace is the only thing
[2:08] the only man cannot develop grace god
[2:11] was the only one that could develop
[2:13] this thing called grace because
[2:16] as we've been talking about the eternal
[2:18] redemption
[2:20] are you catching it that's grace
[2:23] and it was put before there was even a
[2:25] person on the earth to sin
[2:27] grace was already there and i'm going to
[2:30] read you if we get down far enough
[2:32] we don't we'll continue on where paul
[2:33] says says do we
[2:35] in other words are we going to sin that
[2:36] grace may abound no god forbid
[2:39] that grace has come to take away our sin
[2:41] not for sins forward but for the sins
[2:43] that we did
[2:44] in the past like brother branham was
[2:45] talking about here on the on the tape
[2:48] this morning
[2:49] about how that that throne of grace if
[2:51] you're born again that throne of grace
[2:53] is inside your heart and every time you
[2:55] do sin as a sinner with
[2:56] human we sin it takes that away if you
[3:00] quickly say god forgive me then it's
[3:02] completely wiped out
[3:04] now see that's grace that's not us
[3:05] because we
[3:07] we as human beings hold grudges we don't
[3:10] forget
[3:11] you can say you do but you don't
[3:15] amen you be honest with yourself no you
[3:18] do not forget
[3:19] what either somebody did to you or what
[3:21] you did
[3:22] or what something went on you do not
[3:24] forget it
[3:25] but god thank god he's the one that will
[3:28] forget it
[3:29] so he forgets if you're born again if
[3:31] you have
[3:32] that holy of holies inside of you
[3:35] because what did the holy of holies do
[3:38] and i'll read to you here in just a
[3:39] minute did you ever realize that there's
[3:41] 185
[3:43] scriptures that talk about grace and
[3:45] only about
[3:46] 30 of them are in the old testament
[3:49] because it was not unless it was the
[3:51] grace of god
[3:53] himself there was no grace in the old
[3:55] testament
[3:57] it was the law you worked on sunday you
[4:01] you know
[4:01] they had they killed the guy for picking
[4:03] up sticks on sunday they did this
[4:05] if you don't do this if you committed
[4:07] adultery you
[4:08] you didn't go to a court of law you were
[4:11] stoned
[4:12] you and the person you committed it with
[4:14] there was no grace there
[4:16] but now still grace was there for
[4:18] remember grace didn't develop in the
[4:20] old testament grace developed before the
[4:23] foundation of the world
[4:24] right that way it did cover david when
[4:26] he committed adultery and had his best
[4:28] friend killed
[4:29] it did cover rahab because she was a
[4:31] harlot in her old past life
[4:33] and all the different ones ruth being a
[4:35] moabitis and all the different ones that
[4:37] we read and we're going to read them
[4:38] again
[4:39] but we do see grace when you look at
[4:42] adam when god came down in the garden of
[4:45] eden
[4:47] that was grave because adam should have
[4:50] died for what he did
[4:52] eve should have died for what she did
[4:53] but there was grace there and it was
[4:55] grace that was developed
[4:57] before the foundation of the world but
[4:59] now remember you can't have grace that's
[5:01] why this
[5:02] that's why this grace great subject that
[5:04] we're discussing
[5:06] between brother dale and all the
[5:07] ministers myself talking about
[5:10] foreknowledge because without
[5:12] foreknowledge god was a judge and he
[5:14] couldn't be
[5:14] a righteous judge it just this is the
[5:16] way it was
[5:18] amen that's why the prophet of god had
[5:20] to come and give us a grace of marriage
[5:22] and divorce because there was a grace
[5:23] there
[5:24] but remember it don't go over into
[5:26] greasy grace
[5:28] he can't override his word his word says
[5:33] all right so you've got to find grace or
[5:35] unmerited
[5:37] let's look at the at the hebrew lexicon
[5:42] grace is favor and then we're not going
[5:46] to talk about the charming
[5:48] part because that's when you say well
[5:49] somebody walks gracefully or they
[5:51] talk gracefully that has really nothing
[5:54] to do with god
[5:55] that's grace for man on the earth but
[5:57] now see
[5:58] favor and then we're going to look and
[6:00] see that the prophet of god tells us
[6:03] unmerited favor in other words
[6:07] like i just said it's all in who you
[6:09] know well if somebody gets you a job
[6:11] you think you owe that person and you do
[6:13] owe them a little bit of gratitude
[6:15] somebody does something but now not with
[6:17] god
[6:19] god saved you whether you liked him or
[6:21] not
[6:23] but he knew by foreign knowledge that
[6:25] when he presented this to you
[6:28] this grace that you would accept it
[6:31] because see to me grace is the same as
[6:32] the pardon
[6:34] the pardon was extended to the man that
[6:36] killed the guy the grace was
[6:38] or the pardon was extended to the man
[6:41] listen
[6:41] he shot the guy he was a murderer in
[6:45] under the law he was a murderer but now
[6:48] remember what happened he had somebody
[6:50] go and appeal his case
[6:54] like christ appeals our case
[6:57] and then we see that we're going to get
[6:58] into this part where brother brown talks
[7:00] about
[7:00] the real you didn't do it to start with
[7:02] that's what god's looking at
[7:05] he's not looking at the old you he's
[7:06] looking at the new you
[7:08] that he saw before the foundation world
[7:10] that never sinned a day in your life
[7:11] that way you can't stand in judgment
[7:14] you've already stood judgment
[7:15] because when christ was judged you were
[7:17] judged
[7:18] and see that's why in the old testament
[7:20] there's not so much the word grace
[7:22] in the old testament it's a hundred and
[7:25] something scriptures in the new
[7:27] testament
[7:28] because when christ came he brought he
[7:31] was grace he didn't bring grace he was
[7:33] the grace of god
[7:35] because remember everybody thought as
[7:36] brother branham thought
[7:38] that jehovah hated me
[7:42] because it's do's and don'ts and i'm
[7:44] gonna kill you with a firebolt and
[7:46] you know i'm gonna open up the ground
[7:48] and if you don't do this i'm gonna
[7:50] right and then he says now but i thought
[7:53] jesus of the new testament loved me
[7:55] he said come to find out they're the
[7:56] same person but what happened from
[7:58] jehovah of the old to jesus of the new
[8:02] he became flesh he was born like me and
[8:06] you
[8:07] he was now your kinsman
[8:11] his body was judged now saul wasn't
[8:14] judged
[8:15] but his body was judged he gave his soul
[8:18] a ransom though and truly he did
[8:20] christ did go into the holy of holies
[8:23] for me and you
[8:25] and took our judgment he didn't take his
[8:27] judgment he took our judgment
[8:29] so he said whatever they got like boaz
[8:31] he stands up and he says now
[8:33] whatever they've done it doesn't matter
[8:35] i'm taking my shoe off and i'm going to
[8:37] redeem
[8:38] naomi and that's going to restore back
[8:42] everything that she lost when her
[8:45] husband died
[8:46] amen that's what christ did he stood he
[8:50] took
[8:50] calvary and he said i'll take whatever
[8:52] they got right
[8:54] place it on me and that's why that we
[8:57] see this
[8:58] great grace only comes through
[9:02] christ being the son of man
[9:05] our grace now there was grace for every
[9:08] need you know the song there's grace
[9:09] forever need but the grace me and you
[9:11] needed
[9:12] was somebody to come down here in human
[9:14] flesh according to john 1 14
[9:17] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[9:18] among us
[9:21] and we beheld his glory as the only
[9:23] begotten of the father full of grace
[9:26] and truth so he brought grace to the
[9:29] human being
[9:30] by coming on earth and then we can look
[9:33] at the next one says
[9:35] unmerited divine assistance
[9:39] unmerited divine assistance
[9:42] giving to humans see an animal doesn't
[9:46] need grace
[9:48] it didn't fall it's part of the fallen
[9:51] right but it didn't fall man fell
[9:54] and man being here man being the
[9:57] headstone of the human race
[10:01] when he fell though everything below him
[10:04] fell
[10:06] that's why romans 8 says the whole world
[10:08] is groaning and waiting what for us to
[10:09] get right back up to where adam was
[10:11] to be a ruler of this world but what had
[10:14] to happen
[10:14] is the headstone of all had to come
[10:18] to do that because remember the
[10:20] headstone was rejected
[10:21] it became the chief cornerstone which
[10:24] started
[10:25] grace on the day of pentecost to the
[10:28] bride of jesus christ
[10:30] now from the bride of jesus christ look
[10:33] from the bride of jesus christ that's
[10:35] where grace continues
[10:38] jesus is not hearing human flesh except
[10:40] in your flesh
[10:42] and when we stand in judgment we can't
[10:45] have one mark against us or we're going
[10:46] to have to be judged now
[10:48] as brother dale's been preaching there
[10:50] is a judgment that we have because we
[10:52] walk in this flesh
[10:54] and we have five senses of memory reason
[10:57] conscious effects and imagination
[11:02] have you ever had a bad thought
[11:06] now why does god not take that away i
[11:09] was coming up the road today
[11:11] meditating and i had a bad thought
[11:15] just come out of nowhere and i thought
[11:18] lord why please take that thing away i
[11:21] don't want to think that thought
[11:25] all i heard was the prophet preaching
[11:29] did not my prophet preach the greatest
[11:31] battle
[11:33] ever fought there would be no battle
[11:37] if all those bad thoughts would be done
[11:40] away
[11:40] now we know they're going to be done
[11:42] away when we get a body change
[11:44] amen it's going to change us in our
[11:46] spirit realm and we're not going to have
[11:48] to
[11:49] the bible says the former things have
[11:50] passed away all things have become new
[11:52] but now you got to remember you got to
[11:53] run that to a filter though because i'll
[11:55] always know that sister jim was my wife
[11:58] i know what the prophet said you'll
[11:59] always know that that's what went on
[12:01] but you won't remember all the other
[12:03] junk that you did the fights that you
[12:04] had and
[12:05] when you had to sleep on the couch one
[12:07] night and all these different things you
[12:09] know so i've never done that before but
[12:10] maybe some of y'all have
[12:12] you can tell me about it
[12:16] but but through grace though
[12:21] through grace though what happens in
[12:24] grace
[12:25] even grace that you have for the people
[12:27] around you
[12:28] that's where that god's gonna judge
[12:30] through the grace that you give somebody
[12:32] as i've always said
[12:34] somebody changes your tire somebody
[12:36] gives you a cup of water
[12:37] when you read that scripture that word
[12:38] grace is not in that scripture
[12:41] but that's the most that's the most
[12:43] graceful thing
[12:45] that god could ever do was to give
[12:46] eternal life to somebody that didn't
[12:48] want it
[12:49] see that's unmerited favor amen
[12:53] now remember you and i can't we can't do
[12:55] that though
[12:56] if we've been to remember the bible says
[12:59] in romans if we come to a knowledge of
[13:02] the truth
[13:02] there's no more sacrifice for that
[13:04] you're not going to be able to plead
[13:06] ignorance
[13:07] that's right but that guy out there can
[13:11] that's never heard anything except
[13:12] through me and you
[13:14] and what we give him so it is all in who
[13:16] you know
[13:18] but you got to know him first that's
[13:19] right then you can extend him
[13:22] out to the people and see that's grace
[13:24] for this world
[13:25] listen we are the only grace on this
[13:29] earth at the moment
[13:31] once we leave this place there will be
[13:33] no grace for the gentile world which is
[13:36] 99
[13:37] of the world will become ungraceful
[13:42] and that's why they're going to try to
[13:43] kill each other now the grace is going
[13:44] to go to the jews to get 144
[13:46] 000 so grace has not left the earth
[13:48] completely
[13:49] but don't think you can make it there is
[13:51] no grace for me and you
[13:53] once the rapture takes place gentiles
[13:57] you might be a foolish version but i
[14:00] don't think you're going not sitting
[14:01] here today you're not going to play the
[14:03] foods virgin
[14:04] you know too much so you need to get in
[14:08] but it's unmerited divine assistance
[14:11] given to humans for
[14:12] for their regeneration or sanctification
[14:15] a virtue coming from god
[14:18] so it is it to me it's the highest
[14:20] virtue it's grace
[14:22] if you don't have grace you're dead all
[14:25] right a state of sanctification enjoyed
[14:27] through divine
[14:29] assistance and then i like this one
[14:30] right here approval
[14:32] everybody wants to nowadays we're all
[14:36] online and everybody wants an approval
[14:38] rating
[14:38] everybody wants a four-star or a
[14:41] five-star right
[14:42] everybody wants a review and that's how
[14:45] google and all the people put you up
[14:47] here where people can see you
[14:48] is because of your approval rating well
[14:50] i want to ask you a question
[14:53] can your neighbors and can your friends
[14:56] give you a four-star rating
[14:57] for being a christian
[15:00] or do we have lesser reviews and
[15:02] comments that we need to work
[15:04] that we need to work on y'all been
[15:06] through and
[15:07] y'all know what i'm talking about you
[15:09] buy anything online the first thing you
[15:10] get is an email
[15:12] that says can you review this product
[15:14] how did we do
[15:15] how did we get it there fast did was it
[15:18] the product you ordered was it at a
[15:19] competitive rate
[15:20] well that's the same thing we're doing
[15:22] now we've been doing this forever
[15:24] we just not do it been doing it in a
[15:26] computer
[15:27] because if we're going to judge the
[15:30] earth
[15:33] come on if we're going to judge the
[15:34] earth we need to have a four-star rating
[15:36] that's right we need to have you know no
[15:40] negative reviews
[15:44] and by grace we can
[15:47] or by our approval rating so let's go to
[15:51] genesis 6 verse 8 where noah
[15:53] found approval in the eyes of the lord
[15:56] and he wasn't even born again but he was
[15:58] a chosen vessel
[16:00] he actually said lord i believe
[16:03] you're going to reign on this earth and
[16:06] you're going to have to have somebody to
[16:09] build an ark or somebody to get
[16:12] away for these people to make it through
[16:14] because i see you're getting ready to
[16:15] destroy the world
[16:16] right and we'll talk about this
[16:19] afternoon a little more about prophets
[16:20] that's why god sends prophets on the
[16:22] earth
[16:23] he sends prophets for what judgment but
[16:25] he also
[16:26] but it's judgment to the world but his
[16:29] salvation to me and you
[16:31] it's judgment to the world but it's
[16:32] grace to me and you
[16:34] amen and that's what we've come under i
[16:36] don't know
[16:37] i i don't know why people have a problem
[16:39] well i do know why
[16:41] because you look at brother branham and
[16:43] you and you call his name and the first
[16:44] thing they say is well we can't you know
[16:46] he's
[16:46] way off the norm we can believe a
[16:49] prophet over here
[16:50] because he's normal prophet so-and-so
[16:52] and prophet so and so and prophetess
[16:53] so-and-so because
[16:54] because they don't hurt my feelings they
[16:57] let me do whatever i want to do it's way
[16:59] over here on greasy grace
[17:00] but then you got brother adam sitting
[17:01] over here a prophet a vindicated prophet
[17:04] and they don't want to listen to him but
[17:06] see when god sends a prophet that's
[17:08] unmerited grace to a generation
[17:11] a merited approval he sent noah found
[17:14] grace
[17:14] in the eyes of the lord so let's go to
[17:16] exodus 33.
[17:18] and let's just go over this but look
[17:20] therefore i pray that if i have found
[17:22] grace what approval
[17:25] now wait a minute at this moment of time
[17:29] moses is still a murderer
[17:32] he murdered an egyptian
[17:35] god didn't pay any attention to that
[17:39] he did let him go 40 years in the
[17:40] wilderness to get all that burn out of
[17:43] him the prophet said
[17:44] but he came back by a burning bush
[17:46] experience
[17:48] and by that burning bush experience he
[17:50] found grace in the eyes of the lord
[17:51] because listen
[17:52] god was god was going to kill those
[17:54] people
[17:57] moses get out of the way i'll i'll
[18:00] destroy him and one time the bible says
[18:01] he said
[18:02] moses get out of the way i'll destroy
[18:04] them all and i'll raise up a whole
[18:05] another generation
[18:07] when i listen that's exactly what god
[18:12] did
[18:14] god's not ever going to say something
[18:16] and it's not going to happen
[18:19] because eventually the ones he wanted to
[18:22] kill
[18:23] died and a new generation rose up
[18:27] and went into the promised land so noah
[18:30] found i mean moses found grace in thy
[18:31] sight show me now thy way that i may
[18:33] know thee that i may find grace
[18:36] in thy sight and consider that this
[18:38] nation is thy people
[18:40] and the lord said my presence will go
[18:42] with thee and i will give thee rest
[18:43] and he said unto him if thy presence go
[18:45] not with me carry us not hence
[18:48] for wherein shall it be known here that
[18:50] i and thy people have found grace
[18:52] in thy sight is it not in that thou go
[18:55] us
[18:56] with us now what he's saying he's just
[18:58] like he said one time before and i think
[19:00] brother adam even made the comment and
[19:03] i'm trying to stay away from so many
[19:04] quotes that will just give you scripture
[19:05] so that if anybody is watching they can
[19:07] see justice by scripture
[19:09] that we can prove everything that we're
[19:10] that we believe it's not just the
[19:12] prophet of god said
[19:13] everybody understand that amen and we
[19:16] love quotes
[19:18] but there is some time that you have to
[19:19] move them out of the way so that you can
[19:21] explain that it's been in the bible the
[19:23] whole time
[19:24] but what moses is saying moses is saying
[19:26] god
[19:28] they're going to laugh at you the
[19:29] nations are going you brought us
[19:31] out with a mighty hand you brought us
[19:33] into this wilderness
[19:34] you picked these people you know what he
[19:37] said you chose them
[19:39] you picked them now you want to kill
[19:42] them
[19:43] and all the nations are going to say
[19:45] well this god just brought them out just
[19:46] to kill them all that's what he's saying
[19:49] and moses said i beseech you lord
[19:52] please don't destroy him and in one
[19:55] place remember what he says
[19:58] he says if you're going to take them you
[20:00] got to kill me
[20:02] in other words you've got to come over
[20:04] me now what was that that was grace of
[20:07] god that
[20:08] moses had a revelation
[20:11] [Music]
[20:12] that god wasn't going to kill them
[20:14] people
[20:16] if he didn't kill moses but now what
[20:18] happened remember
[20:20] god backed off but what did god say he
[20:22] said i'll make sure they don't make it
[20:24] into the promised land
[20:25] so he did destroy and did raise up
[20:27] another generation
[20:30] for thou hast found grace in my sight
[20:33] and i know thee by name he's talking
[20:34] about the lord the lord said unto moses
[20:36] i will do this thing also that thou hast
[20:37] spoken
[20:40] now see you got to look at this
[20:45] it didn't change god's mind
[20:48] but every you moses has got to speak it
[20:53] for it to become something remember
[20:55] brother brown said a thought
[20:56] a thought then you speak it and it
[20:58] becomes word
[20:59] moses what did he do he caught the
[21:01] thought of god
[21:03] and then he spoke it well see he caught
[21:04] the thought of god that god was not
[21:06] going to destroy him
[21:08] because the lord said i will do this
[21:10] thing also that thou hast spoken
[21:12] for thou hast found favor our approval
[21:16] in my sight and i know thee by name and
[21:18] he said i beseech thee
[21:20] show me thy glory and he wanted to see
[21:23] god and god showed him now let's go to
[21:24] ruth we were covering this last week
[21:27] but there's so much about grace we look
[21:30] in this sea
[21:31] with boaz and ruth we know that boaz saw
[21:35] this woman out in the field and
[21:37] he didn't know her but he didn't know
[21:40] that there was
[21:41] something different about her
[21:44] and then what did he do he said okay he
[21:46] said i'm going to
[21:48] protect you in other words don't leave
[21:52] this field
[21:53] do not leave this message do not leave
[21:55] this
[21:57] grace that you're under amen because if
[22:00] you leave this grace that you're under i
[22:02] can't protect you
[22:03] if you go glean in someone else's field
[22:06] i can't do
[22:07] what i'm supposed to do but if you'll
[22:10] stay in this field
[22:12] which he knew she would god knew she
[22:15] would by foreign she
[22:16] the bride the real bride would stay in
[22:19] his field
[22:22] but now look what she done verse 10 and
[22:23] she fell down on her face
[22:25] and bowed herself to the ground and said
[22:27] unto him why have i found grace
[22:29] in thine eyes and i see it at us we're
[22:31] so unworthy we go through every day we
[22:33] go through every hour
[22:35] we have all these bad thoughts we have
[22:36] all these things that come among us and
[22:38] we say man
[22:39] how can i be saved listen
[22:42] the prophet of god i think he was using
[22:45] a quote from someone else
[22:47] but he said that you can't help for the
[22:50] birds to fly over your head but just
[22:53] don't let them make
[22:54] a nest there now see that's what
[22:57] you and i should learn because when we
[23:00] were sinners what happened
[23:03] when that evil bird flew over we let him
[23:06] make a nest
[23:09] right and he laid eggs and he stayed
[23:11] there he resided there
[23:14] but see that's why the bible says when
[23:15] the unclean spirit goes out of a man
[23:18] in other words you drive him out of that
[23:20] nest you better get filled up with god
[23:22] or that
[23:22] same demon is going to come back with a
[23:24] bunch of his other bird friends and
[23:26] you're going to be 10 times worse or
[23:27] seven times worse
[23:29] so we must not worry about our thoughts
[23:34] unless we entertain them have i got that
[23:39] don't entertain them if you just say
[23:41] lord i don't want to think that thought
[23:43] and you know what most of the time
[23:46] start singing start praising the lord
[23:48] starting thank you lord and now that
[23:49] thing will leave you because the devil
[23:50] doesn't like to be around
[23:51] when the lord's around so why have i
[23:54] found grace in thine eyes
[23:55] that thou should take knowledge of me
[23:57] seeing i am a stranger
[23:59] and boaz answered and said to her it
[24:01] hath fully been showed me
[24:04] so see bill as topping christ he knew
[24:07] before the foundation of the world
[24:08] now boaz didn't but in topping christ he
[24:11] knew he said i know
[24:12] i knew that you were going to be here
[24:15] and all that thou hast done to thy
[24:16] mother-in-law in other words he probably
[24:19] had a few spies
[24:23] boaz was a powerful man and he didn't
[24:27] have ties to ruth but he had ties to
[24:29] naomi
[24:30] and in having ties to naomi he was
[24:32] watching naomi and he was watching this
[24:35] new girl this new bride
[24:39] he was watching her to see what she
[24:41] would do
[24:45] that's why when the bible tells you that
[24:46] if you're good to israel the nation
[24:48] that's good to israel is good to you
[24:49] well that
[24:50] israel naomi tops israel right the old
[24:53] old israel the old woman though typed
[24:55] israel and then
[24:56] that's why we don't say anything about
[24:58] the jews we don't have anything
[25:00] bad to say about them at all and then
[25:03] god's going to honor that that's why
[25:05] that god has honored this united states
[25:07] of america for all these years as we
[25:09] have been a friend of israel
[25:11] now the first time and it's coming up
[25:13] during this administration
[25:14] now the first time it's going to come up
[25:16] you watch and see we're going to turn
[25:17] against israel and then that's when all
[25:21] heck's going to break loose because i
[25:24] just feel that's what's
[25:25] keeping it until all this is going on
[25:28] now
[25:29] you let it you you let us withdraw from
[25:31] israel
[25:32] and you're going to see the firefall
[25:35] because of the bible
[25:36] that's right because of this right here
[25:37] boaz's answer says look it's been fully
[25:39] showed me all that thou hast done to thy
[25:41] mother-in-law since the death of thine
[25:42] husband
[25:43] and how that thou has left our father
[25:45] and our mother in other words
[25:46] she gave all she left everything left
[25:50] the land of
[25:51] thy nativity and now what is the land of
[25:53] not by nativity and we'll stop right
[25:55] here
[25:55] that was her first birth
[25:59] you must leave the land of your nativity
[26:02] your first birth amen
[26:06] you need to go to a land that's not of
[26:09] your first birth
[26:11] because she left everything she what
[26:13] left all of her world
[26:15] all of her friends all of her family
[26:18] didn't jesus come up and say
[26:19] you got to forsake father mother sister
[26:21] brother and come and follow me
[26:23] so she went to the when you got born
[26:25] again you left the land of your first
[26:27] nativity
[26:29] and you became into a place of bethlehem
[26:32] which is the house of god you came into
[26:34] the house of god
[26:37] and then that's when boaz took over with
[26:40] ruth is when she came into his
[26:42] house not just stick house his domain
[26:46] and then he said i'll protect you so
[26:47] we're gonna have to stop right there
[26:49] the lord recompensed i work and a full
[26:51] reward be given thee of the lord of god
[26:53] of israel unto whose wings
[26:55] thou art come to trust like i said
[26:58] before
[27:00] israel is a type of the bride it typed
[27:04] in the old testament under
[27:06] even the law but we'll cover next sunday
[27:11] or maybe not we're not going to do it
[27:13] next sunday we'll be the sunday
[27:14] afternoon we won't have any bible study
[27:16] or bible school next sunday at the july
[27:19] 4th so
[27:20] let's stop right there and then we'll
[27:22] continue with grace but just remember
[27:25] grace was only given by god himself when
[27:27] he became human flesh
[27:29] for me and you the bride he came to get
[27:31] a bride by grace
[27:33] are you saved i didn't get to that but
[27:35] it's in here by saved by grace or you
[27:37] want
[27:37] saved through what faith
[27:41] ruth had to believe though that boaz
[27:44] could do what he said he would do and
[27:46] remember what she did she had to go
[27:48] back to naomi and tell naomi what was
[27:50] going on
[27:52] and naomi said stay in this field he's
[27:55] going to be your
[27:56] he's going to be your spouse one of
[27:57] these days you need to stay right where
[27:58] you're at in other words
[28:00] when the when the lord left israel and
[28:02] came to us he came to a gentile bride
[28:04] so god bless you let's bow our heads
[28:07] when i get finished praying musicians
[28:08] come on
[28:10] the heavenly father we thank you today
[28:11] for this love that you give us call
[28:13] grace
[28:14] and it is not grace lord that we can
[28:18] just do whatever we want to lord but
[28:19] it's grace according to the word of god
[28:22] and that way we pass from death into
[28:24] life and pass away from judgment
[28:27] that you gave us lord unmerited favor
[28:31] but then as that unmet merited favor's
[28:33] been extended
[28:34] lord we do as ruth we didn't just take
[28:36] that frivolously and go
[28:38] running back off to our other country no
[28:40] we stayed and we
[28:41] fell in love with you and we became your
[28:43] bride
[28:44] and we lord cherish you lord that you
[28:47] gave us this grace
[28:49] and that will not ever turn it into
[28:51] lasciviousness like the bible tells us
[28:53] that we'll not take it frivolously that
[28:55] we'll take it lord is
[28:57] unmerited approval from my almighty god
[29:01] thank you lord for all these things we
[29:04] ask in jesus name you'll take care of
[29:05] this service
[29:06] amen musicians come
