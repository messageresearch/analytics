Kings 18 verse 41 says and Elijah said unto Ahab get thee up eat and drink for there is a sound of abundance of rain so Ahab went up to eat and to drink and Elijah went up to the top of Carmel and he cast himself down upon the Earth and put his face between his knees and said to his servant go up now look toward the sea and he went up and looked and said there is nothing and he said go again seven times and it came to pass at the seventh time that he said behold there ariseth a little Cloud out of the sea like a man's hand and he said go up say unto Ahab prepare thy Chariot and get thee down that the rain stop thee not and it came to pass in the meanwhile that the heaven was black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain and Ahab rode and went to jezrael and the Hand of the Lord was upon Elijah and he GED up his loins and he ran before Ahab to the entrance of jezrael amen God bless you tonight you can be seated and want to this is from the from the message the spiritual food induc season and brother Brown speaking to he said Abraham was Ahab was King his father before him had been evil ever since Solomon there had been there just been one evil king after the other and this man Ahab who reigned 22 years in Samaria was the worst of all of them he was a real modernist he believed in real religion certainly and he had everything in a Modern Trend he had his 400 Hebrew prophets all of them well schooled and trained God sent him one and he wouldn't believe it and that was Elijah Elijah the tishbite was a man of the Wilderness not a smooth man but but a rugged Man and one day after he habid sinned until God could stand it no more he spoke to Elijah in the wilderness and here he comes down the road to Samaria as I've often Illustrated maybe the white whiskers sticking out all around his face the Baldhead shining in the sun little narrow little old narrow eyes back there with a stick in his hand and a smile in his face walked right up to the king of Israel and said the do not even do will fall till I call for it and he and he continues on so that God that God had called him and dropped down here and he says for God would not let sin go unpunished there must be punishment what God what good is a law without a punishment what would it what would it do good say it's against the law to run the light and no fine behind it or no punishment behind it it wouldn't be a law so there's a punishment to sin and when God makes a law and that law is defiled then there's got to be a punishment for that and he said in this nation had violated all of his laws oh they had big church they had the temple they had plenty of educated men they had prophets all over the country had schools of them turning them out like a machine and they had plenty of prophets had plenty of priests they had plenty of scribes and they had plenty of religion but they were away from the word of God so God called a man outside of their ranks outside of any of their ranks at all and sent him sent him in with thus saith the Lord and so I just want to lay that as a as a foundation tonight uh looking at a few things that you know brother Brandon was speaking of uh the children of Israel and the Kings and the the situation that the country had gotten in and you know here they are they had had all that God had had blessed them with and had carried them all this way way but when they had gotten away from what God had called them to do or God the place that God had called them to and and when they had gotten away from all of that you know they had all of all of the blessings of God and had all of the things that God had blessed them with but they had gotten away from that and had let all of the world come in and uh corrupt everything that they had and in the midst of all of that but they when God had had done all that he could for him you know then it was it was time for judgment God had called judgment you know he had because when when you're when you have you see the condition that the world is in today and all the things that have happened yet God has blessed people and God has called people and and now we see that the time is of judgment it's it's all there is that around us everywhere we look but praise God as as we look here in the scripture when when God had called Elijah and had called Elijah to to into this position and and was the prophet for the day and was called to proclaim the word to the people God took care of his people and he took care of his Prophet when it was when it was time for for the word to go forth there was people to receive the word there was a group of people that was it didn't go to everybody but it went to a specific group of people to receive that word and and 2 King or 1 Kings 17 verse 1 says and Elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of Gilead said unto Ahab as the Lord God the Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall not be due nor rain these years but according to my word you know so when they when they had done all these things yet when this happened that of all that they had received and all the blessings that they had yet God was trying to call them back to the place that they ought to have been and then you know so when brother brandom said you know when when God gives his mercy and Grace and it's applied to the people when it's spurned then the only thing that's left is judgment and you know he he made a way but then he he continues on here and spiritual food and due season he said and and notice now how he cares for his own before he sent the prophet with the message he said Elijah go down and tell King King Ahab these things and now when you do get yourself away from him right quick for I have a place for you to go during the drought I'm going to take care of you Elijah if you just preach my word do just what I tell you to do so that's what he wanted he wanted he had a place for Elijah and they knew what was going to take place because in the midst of of the word going forth and all of a sudden the Judgment was going to fall in Israel and they were going to face the wrath of God the Judgment was coming but yet God had a place for those that were called and were going to heed the word God had a place for them to come to and it's what he told Elijah listen before before there was ever judgment coming he already had a place made it was already a way of Escape made he already had him a place prepared for him before anything ever happened and praise God that's way we are today whatever is going to take place in the in the future whatever praise God we've already made our reservation we've already under the wings of the shadow of the almighty so whatever comes our way whatever happens praise God we're already protected we're already in the protection and before the wrath of God will come down praise God there's going to be a Rapture there's going to be a taken out of here because whatever is going to take place praise God we've already made our way of Escape because the provision has been made and there's a group of people that have already claimed it and they are looking for a way out amen and so we know here here Elijah and in his time when he was uh down there and you know he just went down there and he told him said listen he said because of the Judgment of God he said do won't fall until I call for it I'm going to be the one now brother R said that was a pretty amazing message to go to there and tell him it all rest on me but it did he was the prophet and it rested on him that he was going to be the one that was going to bring the Judgment because it wasn't it wasn't him making those those declarations it was the voice of God he was the voice of God for the day he was the one that was making those uh prepar you know those declarations but God had made preparation for him because when he went down there and in the midst of all this time he went down and God had made a had a place prepared for him and God took him to the brook cherith and he was down there and in the midst of everybody else in in this time frame everybody was wondering what was going to take place and all of the the uh the heartaches and the problems and all these things that were going on God already had a place for Elijah to go to he was down there by the Brook he had water he had he had provision made because the Ravens fed him and he was sitting down there in the rest place that God had prepared for him that nobody else knew about but God had made it just for Elijah to go to this place and he was down there and God told him said you stay here now what what what amazing thing God tells him said you stay right here because I have prepared a widow woman for you that's going to sustain you on now she didn't realized where she was at but the word of God had already been proclaimed over her life she already she had already because the word of God had already went forth and told her she was prospering she would Prosper but she didn't know that but somebody had to come and tell her that when she went down there when when Elijah went down there to see her you know she was preparing to die she had no hope she had nothing she was all everything was gone all she could see was everything was gone family was gone everything is dry there's no hope there's nothing we're going to die we're just going to make our little cake make our little fire and we're died we're gone and yet the Prophet come and spoke to her and said can you give me a give me a drink of water can you give me a sip of water that's a and you know what and she didn't have a problem in the midst of her famine in the midst of her lack she didn't have the problem with giving that water but when she at when he asked for a piece of bread she had a problem with that now I well listen sir we're we're we're about out you know we're we're scraping the bottom we we don't have anything but you know it was so amazing he's like I know you've just got a handful but just make me a little cake first I don't want all of it just make a little bit right and there had to be something in that woman to to maybe she didn't know who Elijah was maybe she did right we don't know but there was something about the message that he brought that struck a CT in her that she was like you know what I'm going to take you at your word right thank you Lord she made this one little cake when she had nothing when she had reached the absolute very bottom that she could reach she made one little piece of bread for the prophet and you know what she was blessed because the rest of the time the drought was going on she never lost she never went without it never run dry she never went empty when it when it looks like you can't when when when it gets so low when it gets so bad see that's when that's when God wants you to trust him can you put your trust in him when it doesn't look like there's a way out when it looks like there where it looks impossible but With God all things are possible with man it's impossible but With God all things are possible if you can put your trust in him then all things are possible see the devil wants you to continue to think you can't make it but you know what if we look in the scripture we've already made it we've already over we're Overcomers we're more than conquerors through him that loved us but the devil wants us to think we can't make it but no matter what just put your faith in God and whatever he asked you to do you put your faith in him you trust him you have confidence in him whether it looks hard or not just trust him amen amen here's from the message respects and you you you think of the condition that everything was in down there and Israel and the the the condition and all at the time and brother brand says could you imagine that little Jezebel with that painted up face stomping up and down the floor that little hypocrite that little that old hypocrite causing all these little children out here to suffer and all like that Elijah was trying to bring them back to God right trying to win a nation back to God see and look like she could tell the people and you mean to tell me that you'd believe on a man like that that would close the lands up like this and it not even rain or du and all of his hypocrisy or his witchcraft out there whatever she wanted to call it and he's nothing but just a witch or a soothsayer or something he's closed the heavens and it won't rain making all these people suffer and you say then that's the will of God he said it was the will of God why because God had a greater plan he said you must respect God regardless of what he does he knows what he's doing did did look bad children suffering people suffering cattle dying sheep dying no water nowhere the nights was hot and sultry the sun was as bright as brass in the skies through the daytime for three years and 6 months and Elijah sitting up there on the mount said not even do will fall till I call for call from it that's right oh how they hated him how much he was hated because of what but he was only proclaiming the word of God he was only speaking of what God had called him to do and you know there's so many people that are just like that today you know they spend all their time and and they you know they they want to use their carnal mind and they think they can figure out and understand the infinite of God and and you know but God is more infinite because our minds cannot understand because he said my ways are higher than your ways my thoughts are higher than your thoughts and you would not ever understand God because you don't never you never be able to understand the greatness of God but you know there's there's many people you know they want to try to figure these things out and they they wonder why things happen the way they do but God allows things to happen because he's he has a plan and a purpose that we don't understand and you know there's so many people out in the world today and it's like well how can you serve a God that that that allows all these things to happen and all these things because you know if God was a good God he would all he would take care of these things and why are we allow let all these things that have happened and you know all you know it's just all kinds of problems and you know I would never let this thing happen like this and but you know we don't understand because God has a plan and a purpose God God has has a law that's set in in motion and God allows men to have have free will and they're able to do things by their own self and they they allow things to happen and because God wanted things to happen a certain way because he's able to show himself all of his attributes by the things that have taken place and so God allows certain things to happen but God shows because the things that we suffer and the things that we go through in life praise God he shows us his greatness he shows us his wonder he shows us his love he shows us his grace his Mercy has been bestowed upon us and it's been demonstrated why because the things that we've suffered the world don't see that but praise God we see that and he said you know how can you let all these things in in the world just falling apart just you know how can you say that all this was created by God well it wasn't created by God but it was set in motion by God but God allows man to get in his own way and cause all these kind of problems and you know that because God it started with man's re reasoning upon the word and to get away from it and in the end that's going to be his demise because he's going to spend his time reasoning on the word he's not going to trust God to believe what God Said right you know and people oh well if God would you know if God could do this or God could do that I can't believe God will allow these things to happen but you know many times if we were to sit down and and look at things the way things are in this world you know it's like today if if the Lord just come along today and took away all all the sin I'm sorry all the cancer let's say say all the cancer in the world if he took away every Cancer case in the world and he healed everybody and he done away with it all together and there's not every person that would never have any kind of cancer leukemia or anything nothing would ever show up on anybody else for the rest of human existence do you know that as soon as that would happen that it would just take just a few years down the road and people would begin to doubt that God ever done that that you know everybody say well you know what everybody talks about this great conspiracy this great conspiracy that took place called cancer because you know what I never I never had anybody that's ever had cancer never suffered from cancer you know what my parents never suffered from cancer nobody else suffered cancer my grandparents never saw anybody suffer from cancer so you know what it was just a big lie and everybody tries to promote all this stuff that took place that God killed cancer and you know what so all of a sudden people get to the point where you know what it was just a big lie it never really happened just like today every Everything is a conspiracy theory and you know everybody gets so worked up about a lot of different things and it would be the same thing because if God removed all of that but there would be one group that wouldn't believe that it actually took place because it never existed but the second group that would come along if God healed everybody of cancer and done away with it the next thing is the next person would stand up and get up but say well you know why why why are all these children around the world dying of hunger and why are they all the poor things happen to these people around the world and next thing is why didn't God take care of this other problem and they never would ever ever admit that God healed cancer that he delivered everybody from cancer and nobody in the future would ever have that they would never ever see that as the work of God because all they would be doing is well God didn't do this we've got all these other problems look at look at all the other things going on in the world well if God was loving and and just why didn't he take care of these other problems well y'all were complaining that he didn't take care of cancer and he done that but they never but they never will admit and they never could be thankful for whatever God's ever done and they're never going to believe what God done so they they never can move beond beyond that but you know it's like well you know I I would I you know if it was up to me you know I I I would just have the just the menow the mental capacity we could just take care of all these problems but the problem is is it wouldn't do anything you know it's just like it's just like you you see kids out today and you know you spend they spend parents spend all their time and that you can't hurt their feelings and you and you got to give them everything and you got to I mean you just got to these precious little flowers these little buttercups you got to take care of them all the way that's right and you help them well we're we're helping them along we're helping them along we're just we're we're just we don't want to we don't want to mess up their fragile feelings you know don't be confrontational and here here's all these here's all these and you you see these kids and they've been they've been ba babied and they've been petted and and you know they've never had to suffer they've never heard no they've never had to suffer any of these things do you know what you know what kids that do that that have had had upbringings like that do you know what you know what happens to them they lose their minds there are kids today that have committed suicide and they've had parents that have babied them and give them everything under the sun and you know what they can't handle life they don't know what hardship is they don't know what disappoint they don't know how to handle that and so they if they it's like well you know I'm not going I'm not going to let them have any of these problems well you're not going to do them any good you're not helping them and next thing you know what are they doing they're out trying to find drugs or some kind of Escape he's like well you know I I I want to help them I I want to do everything I can well you're not you're not doing anything for them right it's just like if if you if you had somebody and you were like uh uh you know that you know the world full full of homeless people and you have the world's full of homeless people and you like well I'm going to go help somebody like well you know just take one person off the street I'm I'm going to try to help them well you know what if they don't want help you're not going to help them you can give them everything do everything you can and try to help them and and and what and then it's like and if if you went out there and so well you ain't got clothes brother let me buy you some clothes well what if they took their clothes and sold them and took the money that's right if you tried to buy them a place to live or or anything else everything that you give to them they destroy it sell it whatever get rid of it I mean how many how how long would would it take before then well you know what we're just going to give them more no that a lot a lot of these people that that well well we just want to we just want to pour money into everybody and and do all this and do all that well you know what you you can't you can't money money don't fix problems there's a lot of problems in this world you know what it's been more money has caused more problems exactly absolutely just added more problems to the situation you know like the old saying is you can't buy friends because you know what if you can buy a friend for $5 the person that's got $6 you've lost your friendly and that's all it takes sometimes only takes five and a quarter and they're gone but you're not but you're but you know it's like well we're just going to give no you can't you can't do that and everybody like well we just want to we just we just pour our hearts out to these people people yeah I feel sorry for a lot of people and I like to help and I you try to help people but you know what there's a there's a a point that your investment there's no return on your investment and you also have to have some kind of uh discernment on these things it's like because if you're going to help somebody and they're not going to take your help then you know what you helping them has become a detriment to them right and then all of a sudden people like well I can't believe they done me that way well you should have known ahead of time it was going to be like that I mean the writing was on the wall and so it's the same way with God when when God wanted to help people and try to do his word is is his is his law and it's the way of his provision and the way everything is applied and supplied is through the word and God has a law and if you operate by the law of God then you reap the benefits of it and that's the that's the whole thing is it operates by law right and in the whole world and you can't change that you can't get away from that if you you have to know what the law of God the way the law works you know just even in the natural in the natural world how how everything works by the law of God you know I mean you you you set something up on a ladder you walk underneath it you shake the ladder and it falls off and cracks you in the Noggin and there's like well how'd that happen well guess what there's a law called gravity and there's the laws of motion as long as you leave that ladder alone and don't walk underneath it it can't fall and hit you but as soon as you put your play self in that in that place then you're subject to those laws and you're going to and you're going to pay the penalty for it but God has also made a way that if you follow the laws of God then you know what there's blessings there amen and he will pour out a BL the scripture says that he'd pour out a blessing you can't contain what he say he said try me well because there's a there's a law that God has laid out before you if you will operate by that law you can receive you're you're blessed by that but see many people have got to the place and and here in the scripture we see how they got away from the things that God had given them and they made their own way and it didn't work for them you know in the scripture Jeremiah tell and he says Jeremiah 2 says for my people have committed two evils he said they have forsaken me the Fountain of Living Waters and hewed them out sists broken ssts that can hold no water and so here they are the F they have forsaken me the Fountain of Living Water and you know brother Brown talks about in the broken sisters how you know here's this clean refreshing water that's bubbling up and it's just so wonderful and here this Fountain is Flowing before them and here they are able to receive that but they've rejected that and he out sists well that's bad enough you trying to drink out of a sister when you got water that's clear and and refreshing def or you can drink out of this bug infested syst I mean that's that's the you know that's worse than that but the other problem was is they had broken sisters that wouldn't hold water amen so they rejected the living water and they had sists that wouldn't even hold water so they even had it double times worse and because and here in in Jeremiah 3 he says because he said therefore the showers have been withholden and there hath been no light or rain and thou thou Hast a horse forehead thou refuses to be ashamed so here they are when when the they rejected The Living Water but here the showers have been been withholding because they've turned away the word right it was withholding from them just like it was there in Israel when Elijah was speaking to them they had rejected the word of God and the the water had been withheld from them and it was because and just like it was then they have they refused to be ashamed and all of that death and all of that stuff that was going all around them when everything was they were they they were because they they couldn't see that Elijah was the way out that God that God had sent Elijah to bring them back but they wouldn't go forward from that they had rejected that and he said and they hated him because of what he had done and it wasn't that it was God trying to bring them back to the place they ought to be God's trying to bring them back to the place where God wanted them to be trying to show them that God there's so much more that's that's greater than what you've seen and they had rejected that they couldn't see that and so brother brand was speaking here his spiritual food and due season you know he was talking about how he was typing Palestine with the United States and how everything had went wrong here in the United States and he said then finally the presidents or the Kings become become getting more rotten all the time and finally they ended up with this Ahab very type typical of our day and the people had gotten so modern they didn't want to hear the true word of God the true word of the Lord because they had gotten away from it because they didn't want to hear what God had to say no matter no matter how much you try to tell them what the scripture says they spend all their time arguing and trying to tear well that's not that's not the truth you know because they spend more time but you know when you sat down and you begin to look at it and God will only deal with people that that want to hear because you know it can you you try to help people and try to point them to the scripture and even even when you you point out things that are right in the scripture that directly applies to their their life and their situation they think they're somehow exempt then all of a sudden later on when you go when you bring it back to them and you realize that they have exactly the the consequence of what they've done they've reaped what they've seed and you go back and say see that's exactly what you've done and all of a sudden when you see that and you take it right back and you point that to them and you tell them listen this is what you've done this is what's happened and they they'll turn their their nose up they turn their head they not going to listen as I I was I was telling brother Lis Sunday when he was talking about trying to hold on to things people people want to you know you you think you're controlling a situation I I really enjoyed that what brother Luis had to say you're trying to hold on to a situation you're trying to control something and all of a sudden it starts to control you and you know people people get so wrapped up they they're going to try to they want to control something and they want to try to guide it this way and and that way they're they're trying to to lead it to certain way because they think they can they can do that and all of a sudden one of the things that come to me I was telling brother Lis you know you see people you know because they want they want to control this situation because lots of times people think well I I'm doing this for somebody's good because you know what they they they they need they need my help and I'm going to control this situation but you know the problem is is later on what happens to people because they're they're trying to control this situation that sometimes you know what they'll do they'll tell a little white lie oh well you know what they would they wouldn't they wouldn't dare think about doing that but all of a sudden you know what well you know what to because I'm looking out for your good I'm I'm I'm going to tell you a little white l oh and you know what else they'll do steal from you well well you know we're just we're just hiding that from you we're not actually stealing it we're just not giving it to you but we're doing this for your good and you know what I don't want you to get too close to this that brother over there that that brother over you you need you need to watch out for him you know I I wouldn't I wouldn't get too close to him you need you need to watch it and you know what that is some somebody will murder somebody's influence oh I I didn't do that that wasn't me I'm just trying to I'm just trying to help that brother out I'm just I'm just trying I'm just trying to watch out for them because you know what I'm I'm I'm controlling this situation and then all of a sudden you realize well how many how many of these little white lies can you tell and how far over can you go and then all of a sudden it's like well I I'm I'm still I'm still right with God and then all of a sudden you realize I'm not right with God because there comes a time where you're going to face judgment for that sometimes the Lord will send somebody and all of a sudden you realize I got to make a decision i' be I've either got to come clean about this situation or you know what I can I can go too far amen and you know there's there's a lot of people that that that they start out doing something they they they thought they were going to really help somebody I'm watching out for them and in the end they've irreparably damaged a relationship there's there's there's kids out there today and I mean they don't they don't talk to their parents they are so they are so they are so hurt by their parents and you know what and their parents their parents they they had all all the right intentions in the world but you know what you can't you can't control those situations if you're not going to be honest with your kids don't expect your kids to be honest with you whether whether it hurts you whatever it does if you can't be honest with your kids don't expect them to be honest with you whether you got to go back and apologize or whatever else you got to do you got to be right because you know what if you're not right with them you can't you can't be right with God and you know what I would I would much rather show my kids that I can be that I can ask for forgiveness that I can be wrong because you know what I'm human and and if and I'm and I'm gonna make failures and I'm gonna have more failures but you know what there's a way that I can take those out we can cover them not trying not trying to hide them because you're not ever going ever hide them because it's always it's always going to come out sooner or later just like that just like that woman you know she had had all all that all those psychiatrists and all those problems and you know she she had dealt with all that all those years she she had held on to all that all all those those years and you know she just about lost her mind and she had to come see brother brandom and sister media come in there and says bill you got to talk to this lady you need just need to talk to her and brother brand was in there what few minutes talking to her and coming to find out oh he was in a car he was almost hit by a train it was years ago and don't you tell nobody about that I asked the Lord to forgive me of that years ago he said yeah but you didn't sin against God you sinned against your husband right and that was your that was her problem it held her back all those years because she was holding on to something that happened and she thought well I'm just going to cover it up and it never did get covered up right and brother Brown told her said listen said you can go get your husband you you didn't go get your husband because you know he's guilty of the same thing and y'all both need to come up you need to come here and that woman J jumped up not my husband and she went got her husband he was guilty of the same thing said y'all know need to ask forgiveness of each other and pray and ask forgiveness from God see it was all buil up because she thought she could handle the situation and she wasn't able to and it's the same way you're not going to you're not going to get away from the laws of God it's always going to be there amen this is uh First Kings chapter 18 verse 17 it says and it came to pass when Ahab saw Elijah that Ahab said unto him art thou he that trouble Israel and he answered and said I have not trouble with Israel but thou and thy father's house in that ye have forsaken the Commandments of the Lord and and thou Hast followed balum now therefore send and gather to me all Israel and unto Mount Carmel and the prophets of Baal 450 and the prophets of the Groves 400 which eat at Jezebel's table so Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel and gathered the prophets together un Mount Carmel and Elijah came unto the people and said how long halt ye between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him but if bailed and follow him and the p and the people answered him not a word well you know what uh we don't want to get on Jezebel's bad side but you know we're in this mess over here and uh y'all going to have to make a decision one way or the other y'all going to have to y'all going have to choose yeah then said Elijah un the people I even I only remain a prophet of the Lord but B's prophets are 4 and 50 men so here they are all these people and all these prophets and they had to come and and so Elijah made the call to them and told him said listen y'all going to have to make a decision y'all going to have to come because of all this has taking place all these three and a half years of famine and death and all this destruction that you've seen now y'all going to have to make a decision because you know what if you look at me I've been I'm the only one following the Lord but you know what look at the rest of you look puny almost dead you've buried your children look at you your parents are gone but look at me you know what I ain't suffering why because I'm not under the wrath of God why because God has made a way for me God's made provision for me why because I'm in I'm in the the place of safety I mean I'm sheltered behind the word so now y'all got to make it decision are y'all going to continue in the way that you are going right now and face death or are you going to turn and come back to God because all of all of the prophets that you've heard before and know what God has done and you've seen this is Judgment are you going to listen to them 450 now it's time to make up your mind this is from the message spiritual food and due season brother Bram said he said so he knew that it would take more than just an ordinary theology he said it would take more than just or an ordinary message he said it would take more than just preaching the word to crack their Stony Hearts he knew it would took thus sayith the Lord to send that judgment down upon that people so he know that when he went out with thus sayith the Lord and it was thus sayth the Lord to spurn that was judgment we see that in our day too we see that in any day there's nothing left but judgment when he step when you step over the line of mercy so when he sees what was taking place they come to that place and he realized that it would take more than just preaching the word because he came because that's the reason he brought them all to the Mount Carmel had that Mount Carmel Showdown he said y'all got to come here and make a decision amen why because he said now is the time y'all going to have to decide whether you're going to listen to them or you going to listen to God is God true he said now that type there he said I'm going to type Elijah with the church today the Church of today just before judgment he received this message Elijah he represented being cared for in the natural his natural food because it wasn't going to rain now according to the word of God for three years and six months or until Elijah called for it whatever time you say Elijah that's what it'll be therefore he walked up to the king and said there won't even be due till I call for it he said that's quite a load isn't it that's quite a message he said now we're going to type that with the spiritual Dr out of today now we all know that we are very aware that there is a great spiritual drought in the land today spiritually speaking and you know that there is a famine in the land I'm sorry that it was predicted by the prophets just before the second coming of Christ he said there would come a famine in the land and it wouldn't be for bread alone but for the hearing of the word for the word of God and that day is now hearing the true word of God now this types the natural drought with the spiritual and unbelief by false teachers and modernists in the church had brought the place to this coming oncoming judgment then they had turned from God's word and his Prophet to a modern theological terms of the word so we see how you know because you see the way the world is today and uh you know they they have the the modernist and it it's really interesting that lots of times when you read brother brandham he'll always say a modern Billy Graham why because what what did Billy Graham go to he went to the world because they had they had their own way of believing and they had turned away from the word they had this modern way of thinking because there was just a group and when you go back and study it you know all of the things all of the Miracles that took place in the scripture didn't take place Jesus wasn't born of a virgin all the other things that was written in the scripture they don't believe any of that they've they've got their own Modern Way of believing it well how in the world did a virgin conceive how in the world did he part the Red Sea how in the world did he open blind eyes they didn't believe any of that well Jesus was just a good man Jesus was just a prophet some people are out there and they don't even believe that Jesus existed you know how do you how do you know that Jesus actually existed that he wasn't just some story that was concocted by some Hebrew Shakespeare and you know and well I don't I don't know I don't know you know I I I I don't know I I just I just wonder and so they they spend all their time we see they have all of this everybody's so wishy-washy there there nobody's stable no nobody's in a in a solid place and nobody nobody sees but you know what it's the if if God speaks to you and God God reveals him himself to you then it's not then it's not just just what mama and daddy said Mama and Daddy may not even know anything about it but you know what if you have a personal experience with God when you've had when you've come in contact with the supernatural when you've had these things happen to you it don't matter what anybody says you know what you can you can stand up and you and you can bring everything in the world and try to convince me this ain't the truth well guess what you're you're too to the party you're not going to convince me that this is not the truth see you can't you can't show me that it's not the truth I've already I've already received my portion I've got I've got my confidence and everybody else can be walking around in a in a drought and and they can go through all this and the famine and everything like that but you know what I'm feasting on Mana I'm I'm feasting on the word true and then this is from the junction of time then brother brother says and then just before that God brought The Showdown to show who was God he said there come a time that there was a prophet came into the land by the name of Elijah who was anointed with the message of God and he performed the miraculous and proved that omnipotence still was miraculous the prophet stood out there and closed the heavens that it didn't rain in the days of his ministry and he brought the Rains Down out of the heavens and give the Earth and Angels appeared on the scene Hallelujah baked him some cornbread and they kept him 40 days of Life while he was out there in the wilderness so what you know when he called and but God wanted to show them what was going to take place then he was he was showing what was going to take place he was showing he had somebody that was had went through these things it just wasn't him talking about he knew what he had seen the Supernatural he went through the Supernatural and he was manifesting the supernatural but to those that believe they saw that just in our day see a lot of people they don't they don't believe that but you know what but those that have go God has showed Mercy to than you Lord to come to open our eyes we've seen the supernatural we've seen the miraculous we've seen the omnipotence of God we've seen these things take place whether whether nobody else believes it or not we've seen it take place we know what's truth we we've we've experienced this and so when you see all these things that that came down he you know he told all of them now I've I've witnessed these things and God has told me what's going to take place and he called all the people up there to Mount Carmel and he had all those problem prophets and he told those prophets he said now we're going to we're going to see who answers whether God will answer by fire or we bail answer by fire why because but you know he he said listen I've had this Supernatural and I know what God's told me and I tell you what's going to take place we're going to build the altars we're going to have the oxen we're going to have everything set in order and he said then we're going to see who answers by fire we're going to have everything set in order like it's supposed to be where we're going to say who to anwers and they said you know the prophets of baale spent all their time out there cutting themselves and praying and seeking seeking baale to come and answer and you know Elijah was sitting over there just resting and relaxing and saying well maybe he went fishing maybe he's out somewhere but just y'all need to yell a little bit louder it's like is this all you got they're out there cutting themselves and everything like that going into a frenzy and you know like well let me when y'all get done I'll start mine but he just kept going on and on and on all day all day they were out there and nothing ever happened but the scripture says here in First Kings and it says and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice when the evening time came why because Elijah had the word of the Lord and he knew when when when to do these things he had set everything in order and he knew when God wanted it done he said that Elijah the prophet came there and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel and that I am thy servant and that I have done all these things at Thy word hear me oh Lord hear me that these people may know that thou art the Lord God that thou H has turned their heart back again he was going to show them what they who he was and that he's turning them back because that was the word that was given to Elijah just like in our day there was a word that was given in our day to turn our hearts back he said then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up all the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the Lord he is the god the Lord he is the god and Elijah said unto them take the prophets of Baal let not one of them escape and they took them and Elijah brought them down to the brook of kesan and slew them there and Elijah said unto Ahab Ahab get thee up eat and drink for there is a sound of abundance of rain and that's where we started our scripture this this afternoon reading from when did they hear the sound of when when did when did the prophet hear the sound of abundance of rain when the Judgment had fallen and it had the Judgment had been fulfilled why because all of those prophets were taken down there and destroyed and killed when all that had taken place and because of what had taken place because of the battle that took place when when it when The Showdown took place and the people and they turned their hearts back because what they had saw and they said he is the Lord he is the god he is God he answered he answered by fire the Elijah's God is correct he's calling us back we've been under judgment this whole time but he's bringing us back he wants us to come back and when they turn their hearts back to fall on the ground to worship God and and we're coming back lord we've been away but we want to come back and when they when they step forward to do that then all of a sudden then Elijah says listen I hear the sound of abundance of rain I hear I hear a rainstorm coming I I why because judgment is passed amen see now we're stepping into this see when God has called us to this God has called the the The Messengers and this is from the evening message brother R said therefore when God sent forth His prophets his messengers of The Testament he spoke to one man and that man had to bring the message others went from him everywhere bringing the same message he said but there had to be one headquarters God has always had it he said I'm thankful he has got it tonight that's the holy ghost of course see we all know now not some group but the holy spirit is God's headquarters that's God's messenger of the hour amen now what is it to the prophet that the word comes always come if they are true a true prophet of the of the word god vindicates his word by that Prophet now there's there's been many false prophets and we've had them all Through the Ages we go back to the Old Testament and we see them rise up and speak in in the name of the Lord and it wasn't right God would have nothing to do with it he never vindicates nothing but his own word anyway he wouldn't run his business like that right he has a he has a plan and he has a purpose and he brings it to pass he has a he has a will and it's his word and he brings it to pass and he vindicates his own word he said Just remember God only vindicates his word and only a true Prophet the only way you can tell whether he's true or not is by the word that's the way to judge him whether the word comes to pass or not because if it's showing exactly what those scriptures says and that's exactly what it done was when they came out there the god came and Vindicated exactly what he told them and it's the same way it is in our day we've received a message and because you know what as as as you begin to not not look through some denominational ideas or read some denominational book but if you sit down with an open heart and and and seek God and you begin to read the scripture then all of a sudden you begin to understand that this message is the word of God it's not some part of it but it is the word of God and you know what there's not there's not some you know 60% or 70% or this or that or some you know brother Brandon was confused no brother Brandon wasn't confused he was the mouthpiece of God whether he was so he was either 100% right or we need to get rid of all of it because it either has to be all right or all wrong and we we've got to have it just like that we've got to lay our put our whole confidence in it we've got to put our stake our whole lives on it that it's actually the truth or it's not you've got to believe that it's the truth it's thus sayith the Lord or it's not the more you put your trust and confidence in God the more you come to see that it's the truth it becomes real it becomes Manifest this is from this is from the message look brother B says he says what are what are you looking at this morning he said what are you looking at did you stop in this hideous hectic day that we're that we're living in he said what are you looking for God has placed everything the troubling of the waters that that first little move people jumped in the sign of in the hand in the sky IAH said that cloud the size of a man's hand like a vapor what is it he kept believing I hear the sound of abundance of rain that cloud became two clouds two clouds became a hill and a a hill became a mountain the mountain became Another Mountain the first thing you know the whole Skies was thundering and rainfalling what was it he accepted what God sent and this morning if if that little thing has touched your heart and it says I need that that's little sign the sign of a of a hand of a man come so if you see just like he said he he saw that little he heard that sound of abundance of rain and everybody's like what's he looking at I don't see nothing and when he sent his servant up there on the mount he said go look go look I see nothing go look I don't see anything go look when he went seven times the only thing he saw in the distance was a cloud the size of a man's hand and that and that was the confirmation of the rain that he had heard and he saw that that was the confirmation and Elijah's up there telling Ahab you better get in your Char and you better get back to jezrael cuz you know what not going to survive this storm said you better go you better get you better get prepared because here it comes here comes all this the The rain that's coming and all of this and they they that that just that little cloud of a man's hand that that's all you see that's all the evidence but that's all the evidence that you need the scripture tells us that that all of a sudden and the Scripture it tells us that when you saw later on they saw it and all of a sudden the skies were so black and all of a sudden the rain began to fall all of a sudden it's started with what just one little just one little Cloud brother BR says and that's the way about people who want to get healed he said if if they can just have one little visible evidence like e like Elijah when he said Gesa said I see a cloud about the size of a man's hand Elijah said I hear the sound of abundance of rain he saw the evidence that's why many times I tell the people go on start praising the Lord see because that is the adopted baby because that it's in their intellectual until it comes into their soul that they're healed then Faith makes it right he said you've got to know what you're doing you've got to have confidence in what you're doing so if you would just take him at his word whether you see the evidence or not but if you but if you have confidence and believe that God spoke to you whether you whether you see any evidence or not but if you take God at his word then he said just continue to praise God for it because it's going to come to pass all you got to do is believe it so you just keep holding on because it's going to take place see brother B says I'm going finish with this but you know we see all these things that are taking place if if you have a need you just trust God because if God's ever done it one time in your life if he's ever healed you one time if he's ever healed anybody of it one time then you know what he'll do it again you don't have you don't have to wether you know worry or or fret over whether God's going to do it or not because like I like I preached before you know if you take God at his word it's it's just like having a court trial you go before God you don't have to plead and beg all you got to know is what the word says and apply the word to your situation when you go to court you know you take the law and say this is the situation and this is what the law says and as long as you meet what the law requires then you know what you've got to have the Judgment go in your favor that's all you got to have you ain't got to get in there and try to plead and beg and tell a sob story to the judge the judge don't care about none of that judge the judge wants to know what the evidence is and what the law says and if you have somebody and let me tell you see we've got the judge and the jury and the lawyer all on our side why because he's the Lord Jesus Christ and so he's got it and he comes in the court and all you got to do is believe him just trust in what he says then you can receive exactly what you have need of I'm we'll finish with this this is have the musicians come he says he said and we look down he said at this blessed old word and it and it said these days would be here and here we stand we see the IM omnipotent god with his arm outstretched and signs and wonders are coming we hear the sound of abundance of rain in the air we know that we're in the great day of the last rain when Satan will be bound and cast into the pit chained with a chain of circumstance that he cannot come out and deceive the Nations no more and a thousand years Millennial reign will take place on the earth while we're glorifying our lord Jesus and adoring him crowning him Kings and kings and Lord of lords he said and this old sinful Earth will bust open some of these days when the atomic powers are loose and the hydrogens will in every Sea and the water and the Sea will weep till it's dry oh God and the sun will fail to shine and the moon won't give its light and the stars of heaven will fall like an untimely fig tree when she's shaken of A Mighty Wind and men will cry for the rocks and the mountains and what This Little Light would amount to then then the dead in Christ shall rise oh what a paradise Nations shall not lift up sword against Nation anymore neither will there have to be a prayer line for the sick today is the day of salvation what a great day that we're looking forward to because one of these days all of these things are going to be over with we see we see that judgment's at hand but praise God we have a way of Escape God has made God has given us the provision God has given us everything that we have need of let's all stand this evening and if you have a need them then you claim what belongs to you you know you know a man a man is just as good as his word but you know what a a man that gives you his word you know you're just you're only as good as you believed that because if somebody stood there and says well I'm I'm gonna give you what you have need of whatever whatever you know you give you money or whatever whatever it is and you know he you can stand there and hold it here you go if you ain't got faith to walk up and claim it then what what is it that that that you don't believe that that he would give that to you and many times we we we hinder God because of our unbelief sure because God is trying to bless us and we I don't I don't know I don't know and sometimes God wants to see how long you how long you going to stand there are you are you willing are you willing to wait God told God told Abraham that that he was blessed that he was going to have a son everything everything that that belong he said everywhere you put your foot and everywhere you look all this Belongs to You Abraham you see this and it'll belong to your seed right and can you count can you count the Stars can you count the sands on the beach that's the number of of your seed an old man that was one foot in the grave one on the banana peel and he's going he's going to tell you I'm going have children you need a psychiatrist right need put you in the rubber room somewhere but you know what that didn't change Abraham I didn't change Abraham's faith and you know what even even when Abraham fail and lied you know why he didn't change Pro the promise of God in his life and you know why he picked himself up and kept going right and what brother brandham say the Seed of Abraham he said every the bride he said would take the same Journey he said every son of the faith takes the same Journey so if you fall guess what Abraham did too but God kept his hand on Abraham and the promise didn't change to Abraham and he was more than a conqueror he received he received the promised son it didn't it didn't stop when when he fa and you know he got all confused and decided he was going to follow his wife's Doctrine he didn't change the plan of God it might have made it a little hard on him but it didn't change the promise of God right CU God had had it one way of what was going to take place amen right he had one son y now he had other children but he had one promised son that was Isaac right Isaac was going to be the one amen that was going to bring forth that was going to fulfill what he told Abraham and you and I are the same way God has called you nobody else can take your place because if God spoke to you then you know what you're the one that's going to overcome you know what we're no match for the the devil but you know what with us in the word and him in us the Satan's no match for us he's no match for the word and that's what God has given us sir amen God bless you this evening let's sing a song Jesus has a table spread where the saints of God are fed he invites his chosen people come and die with his
