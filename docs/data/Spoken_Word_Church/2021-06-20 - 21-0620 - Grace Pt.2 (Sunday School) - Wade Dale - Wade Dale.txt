TRANSCRIPT
========================================
one of you good to have you here today happy father's day again like he said but we have a heavenly father and we need to give thanks for every day i was thinking this morning i see all the father's day wishes are coming have we said our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth that is as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread that all comes from our father amen great to have an earthly father but more than to have a heavenly father amen amen so we've been talking about grace if you want to go ahead and pull up there brother anderson uh the hebrew lexicon of grace would be we know what the prophet said but let's look at what the uh the greek lexus lexicon says took this candy out to be spitting everywhere favor now we know that the prophet god told us and we see that grace is unmerited but look at this word favor favor comes from favorite amen favor favorite all right because he does favor us above the world he doesn't want to he wants to favor everybody but see they will only only the ones that are in him will accept the grace that he's given which is charm favor elegance because we were talking about last sunday there is a word called grace fall now see to me the bride of jesus christ is graceful we walk because that you know you say this person walks with a with a a graceful gate well same thing with a christian the world walks with a different one they walk with one you can't watch amen that's their charm and elegance and that's the world but now with god see i like this word right here acceptance amen we are accepted in him or we are chosen in him before the foundation of the world all right let's go to the definition of grace in the in the uh webster's dictionary it tells us it's unmerited divine assistance now as we were talking about last sunday grace was not developed by man grace only comes from god satan has no grace we have a limited amount of grace we have a lot more condemnation because that's just the way we are but god gives us unmerited and shows unmerited divine assistance given to humans for their regeneration or sanctification so you you have to have grace to get the new birth yeah grace has to be extended and then grace has to keep being extended every day of our life all right so we're going to see here in just a little bit how that works so it's a virtue look coming from god not coming from man right a state of sanctification enjoyed through divine you see that word divine only god is divine so it's coming from god it's god's assistance it's unmerited godly assistance given to humans a state of sanctification enjoyed through godly assistance or i like this one right here approval yeah all right that word approval because let's go to genesis 6 verse 8 we're just going to read through scripture and not read any quotes at the moment but noah found grace this is the first time you're going to see the word grace as in favor now you're going to see grace as we said before there is one where you say well if i found grace humanly not to god if i found grace in your sight or or give me grace to tell you this story there's plenty of words of grace in there but this one is the only the first one that says the hebrew lexicon 2580 that noah found grace in the eyes no what did he find favor he found acceptance in the eyes of the lord go to exodus 33 verse 13 it says therefore i pray that if i have found grace in thy sight now who is this this is moses show now me now thy way that i may know thee that i may moses said because moses knew if the presence of god didn't take them he couldn't take them for within shall it be known here that i and thy people have found grace in thy sight because remember now grace is unmerited divine assistance unmerited he knew those 2 000 or 2 million jews were not going to make it to the promised land but he give them grace or a time to repent poured out grace unmerited knowing they would do wrong same way with me and you is it not in that thou go us with us so shall we be separated all right separated i in thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the earth so in other words moses is praying now look at verse 17 and the lord said unto moses i will do this thing that thou hast spoken for thou hast found grace in my sight in other words moses moses and hattie wright said the right thing right he's telling moses you've said the right thing hattie wright said the right thing and found grace in the eyes of god by saying the right thing all right and i will do this thing also that thou hast spoken for thou has found grace in my sight and i know thee by name and i said and he said i beseech thee show me thy glory and that's what he asked about was to show me who you are now let's go to ruth 2 verse 8. we can have sunday service now tim afternoon sir here then said bull house under ruth here is thou not my daughter go not to glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by my maidens and we talked about this last sunday we're talking about grace this is grace part two because boaz didn't know ruth that well he knew naomi was kinfolk to him but now ruth was not ken she was a moabiter she was a right but boaz type in christ because look what she's what he says let thine eyes be on the field that thou do reap and go thou after them have i not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee now he's never met this this girl before and when thou art the thirst going to the vessels and drink of that which the young men of drum then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him why have i found grace in thy eyes remember grace is what unmerited favor or favor or approval right then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said why have i found grace in thy eyes have you ever asked god that i have several times lord why me why in the world because he has given me unmerited favor and he knows the end from the beginning that we will accept god he knew that there was something about this woman look that thou should have taken knowledge of me seeing i am a stranger now watch what boaz said boaz answered and said unto her it had fully been showed me by revelation boaz knew who ruth was now watch that all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband i was telling you before last sunday listen unmerited favor is what god does not what you do but listen you do have something to do because if you don't and you say well it's just me and i can go do this and i can sin all i want to that's greasy grace right right that's not god's grace grace is unmerited favor and you say well i have the prophet tells us many times there's nothing you have to do it we know that but it is a lot what we have to do right god knows what we'll do with it before we do it by pre-predestination predestined journey by for knowledge not just by a set time and a set place and this is what it's going to be because like i said before god would love to give grace to the whole world but he knows the whole world will not accept that grace a pardon is not a pardon unless it's accepted as a pardon all right and boaz answered and said to her it had fully been showed me all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thine husband and that thou that thou hast left thy father and thy mother you've left the world right and the land of your nativity in other words your first birth and art coming to a people which thou knowest not heretofore the lord recompense thy work and a full reward be given thee of the lord god of israel under whose wings thou art come to trust all right so now let's go to the next lady in the bible that found grace in esther 2 verse 16. now watch this so esther we know the story of esther that um you know one thing's for sure she was the queen but she had to be called or summoned to be able to go into the court or it was death if if if the king didn't put out the sepulcher all right the scepter then she would be killed it doesn't matter if she's queen or not amen but now remember he loved esther oh yeah he loved esther he loved her from the beginning from the first time he saw her he loved her so esther was taken unto king asaurus into his house royal in the ten tenth month which is the month tibeth in the seventh year of his reign and the king loved esther above all the women after being a type of the bride he loved her above all the women and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins how about that so that he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of vashti and we know the whole story we've been through it of the book of esther but look what happened later on when she had a dire need to save her people that she said i haven't seen the queen and the king in 30 days he has not called for me in other words the call's not come for me to meet the king but i'm going in anyway and if i die i die if i live i live and what happened when she walked in the king saw her hadn't seen her in 30 days and that was a woman he loved jesus hadn't seen us in 2000 years amen he hasn't physically looked on us in 2000 years but when we enter the court and not put on the world apparel the bible says she shunned all that and they tried to put this on her and tried to kind of like david they tried to put this on him and they tried to put they said no i'm going like i am she said i'm going like i am if i live i live and that's the way we should be not just with the message of the hour but with christianity to find grace in the eyes of god doesn't take this message but it does take you up that statue of a perfect man it takes you it makes you a mature christian that's what we want to be that's the call of this hour is not just to be christians it's to be mature christians know what god wants know what god wants before he even asks it that's what he said psalms 84 verse 11 says for the lord god is a sun and shield the lord will give grace and glory there's no one like i said before man cannot develop this word called grace it had to be a divine person right that could see the end from the beginning to give grace to a group of people unmerited favor and glory no good thing will he withhold from them that walk upright like i said before we're we're not a church of do's and don'ts but if you get the new birth a lot of that gets taken care of you can preach here and this and we've heard heron dress for 50 years and the women still do it and the men still do what they do but i'll promise you if you get born again you won't do that okay so i'm just as plain as i can be at women if you're cutting your hair wearing makeup doing the things the prophet should not do you're not born again and you're going to meet god that way same way amen men we do things we're not supposed to do you're going to meet god with that you're not going to meet the prophet you're going to meet god with it right that's right now we know and i'm going to develop this only further because remember we had to come to a place that we needed a grace of marriage and divorce that had to be given to us by an individual man a prophet right amen a prophet had to give us grace but it wasn't his grace he was extending god's grace he was extending he was extending the supper sepulchre when we entered into this last church age to give us a grace of marriage and divorce not just for our fleshly marital problems but for our spiritual marital problems because a lot of people are still married to their own husband or even just divorced him or put him in a closet no the bible says your husband needs to be dead that's what the prophet was trying to tell the people your whole husband needs to be dead right if you're if your old husband is dead you're free to marry only in the lord right everybody got there proverbs 1 verse 7 the fear of the lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction we've seen that haven't we my son hear the instruction that says father's day my son hear the instruction of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother for they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head and chains about thy neck many times we look at the the ten commandments which the world has made them ten suggestions not ten commandments all right it's just 10 suggestions same way in the message there's a lot of quotes that they just want to suggest that you listen to or you want to quote so but anyway they shall be an ornament of grace until i head in chains about thy neck you and i are brother brown said we're robed with unmerited grace unmerited favor so like as as um brother ronnie was uh we had a little service there on friday afternoon for the young for all us young kids all those young men and that's what we got to do we got to make sure we do the right thing we're men the men we have to carry the gospel the women can't carry the gospel and if satan can mess us up from the beginning see we go past that grace we come out from under that unmerited favor and it becomes greasy grace and you see people double married triple med trying to preach in the message and it's just not going to happen ain't going to work out god cannot go over his word and make it well you know what well it'll be all right no well it won't be all right a well is a deep subject for shallow-minded people ain't that right louise hey buddy my son hear the instructions of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother for they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head and chains about thy neck even in the ten commandments it tells us to honor our father and mother that your days remember that's the only one with the first one with promise in the ten commandments honor your father mother that your days may be long on the face of the earth amen we see a lot of kids out in the world that die very young why you don't know maybe they dishonor their mother and father they're not doing what god said to do exactly and i've seen people that live long lives because they've always honored their father and their mother see that now that's that's in the bible amen that's in the bible so we don't need to we don't need to get rid of that it's not a suggestion kids us all of us for they shall be an ornament of grace in other words what do you do with an ornament you wear it you wear it and show the world now the problem is is we try to show the sometimes try to show the world that we're up here and we're better than them people out there now that's not that's not god that's not god now we're talking about last sunday about the son of man if we're supposed to act like the son of man the son of man the bible says the bible says that the son of man was not and you know jesus told him said well you know they said well that's just the carpenters boy that's joseph's son that he's a wine beverage look we think he drinks a little too much wine we he hangs around with and he hangs around with sinners and and all that and they asked jesus about that and what jesus saying he said a prophet doesn't have honor in his own country they don't honor him because he's just brother bill he's just brother sam he's just brother wade he all these different things and we were talking about that um yesterday afternoon the son of man was humble the son of man didn't carry his bible like brother branham he didn't wear belt buckles and all that stuff i thought that's what we're supposed to be we're supposed to be the son of man in the end time we're not supposed to have to shout we're not supposed to have to scream at demons jesus talked to him and that's what the son of man did that's the son of man folks we got to get out of pentecost we got to get into the son of man ministry and act like him read matthew mark luke and john that's the son of man if that ministry is to come back in the end time there's our grace our grace is that he saw that we would accept that son of man message and not turn it into a pentecostal revival just saying let's read this right here in zechariah and then we'll be done musicians get ready to come zechariah 4 verse 6. listen to this then he answered and speaking to me saying this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who out there oh great mountain now what are we talking about we're talking about the end time we're talking about a zerubbabel coming in and you know getting the foundation swept off and and be able to build this mountain we call the statue of a perfect man who art thou great mountain before zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone now who is the headstone that's the son of man amen that's what the ages have lost that's what brother branham they couldn't understand why he was preaching the way he was preaching and they turned him down because they turned jesus down in the same way and they'll turn you down and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying what not just graves thank god he sent us a prophet to say listen if god says something twice you better listen when jesus said verily verily he said you better listen to what he's saying shouting what unmerited favor unmerited favor unto it sister hattie wright didn't have to do anything she just believed what the prophet of god said and he said whatever you ask that's what you'll get right and merit he didn't say now hattie you don't have no money you don't have this and he ain't mentioned all that you've got a sister's in a wheelchair he said she asked the greatest thing and god gave grace to two boys that had not had grace before through their mother right interceding listen to this last one and it will close right here musicians get ready to come zechariah 12 10 and i will pour upon the house of david now what is the house of david jews not gentiles because remember this derubable crying grace grace unto it it was to rebuild the temple rebuild and restore worship to israel but a type is to do the same thing with me and you as elijah did on mount carmel he restored the altar right and turned them back he didn't turn them back but he said lord that i may turn them back but that's what the message of elijah was was to turn the hearts back to the faith of the fathers and that's what happened to us in the first part of his ministry and i will pour upon the house of david upon the inhabitants of jerusalem the spirit of what grace and supplication and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn from for him as one mourning for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is bitterness for his firstborn what are you saying brother wade listen our grace that we get the grace that we have is going to take us in a rapture but it's not going to finish it's going to go to jerusalem and under the last week of daniel 70 weeks where the six-fold purpose is to happen that six-fold purpose is to extend grace to israel according to zechariah and i will pour out upon the house of david because he can't do it now because he's dealing with gentiles he can't deal with the gentiles and jews at the same time but he's going to pour out upon the inhabitants of jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplication everybody got that so our the grace that we get is going to be extended right over there to the jews and they're going to get a three and a half year ministry of grace from two prophets after we're gone but grace will be extended to them because right now look what he says he says look they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one morning for his only son those two prophets come on musicians are going to preach so much grace that they're going to say where did you get those scars he says in the house of my friends and god's not going to destroy him he said he wouldn't destroy him he's not going to destroy israel he's going to redeem her back but not redeem her back his bride because he can't have two brides at the same time amen so god bless you think of that grace is unmerited favor you say well now brother dale's been telling us it's nothing we do yeah it's nothing you've done but it has a lot to do with what you do everybody got there they'll say well now i don't have to go to church i've got the message of the hour i'm about this full with it you know i've got to ever quote and i know every book and i know where brother dale's going to preach next week because he preached it last week so i think i'll just stay home well now that's not grace right that may be greasy grace but that ain't grace grace has unmerited favor from god as he saw what you would do with the word that he gave you when he sees what you do with the word he gave you not bob not brother bob he gave me and he gave you the word individual word that he gives each one of us because listen grace is not for a crowd except hold on israel it's for 144 000 for a group gentiles it's individuals amen unmerited favor for individuals as a gentile bride but now remember he saw who would and he saw who wouldn't before knowledge so therefore then he could predestinate because he predestinated by what he saw you do when you got here amen god bless you [Music] you
