[9:26] and the different ones that the freedom
[9:28] you know all heard all that
[9:31] um
[9:31] having to get her up out of the floor
[9:33] and all that stuff and
[9:35] um
[9:36] we just pray they'll give her strength
[9:38] and I don't have any results back from
[9:41] my test from Friday so no news is good
[9:43] news so we will uh
[9:46] let you know what's going on and
[9:50] um
[9:51] we just believe all is well anyway so
[9:53] we're we're I'm not worried about it so
[9:56] I just don't like to go to the doctor I
[9:58] don't like to get prepped I don't like
[9:59] to get shot I don't like to get gassed
[10:02] you understand what I'm talking about
[10:04] are you well if you live long enough
[10:07] all right let's go to the son of man
[10:08] part 127 uh tonight we're going to speak
[10:11] a little bit back on our uh subject that
[10:15] we were talking about of metamorphosis
[10:18] we'll continue a little bit more
[10:20] because
[10:22] what started out looking one way
[10:26] ended up looking another way
[10:29] but it was the same life it was the same
[10:31] person
[10:32] isn't that what's happening to me and
[10:34] you the man that's what's happening to
[10:36] us in our life it's the metamorphosis of
[10:39] God that has changed us from the inside
[10:41] out and that's what it is with the the
[10:43] caterpillar and all that the the
[10:45] butterflies already in there even in the
[10:47] little egg the butterflies in there
[10:48] somewhere the big beautiful wings and
[10:50] all the pretty things and we know that
[10:53] that well we'll look at there's it's
[10:55] kind of funny there's four stages to the
[10:57] butterfly and there's four stages to our
[10:59] restoration of of the word back in power
[11:01] in the end time uh brother Brown said
[11:03] you know four deaf Messengers ate it the
[11:06] tree down in four life Messengers will
[11:08] bring it back so we'll talk about that
[11:10] just a little bit but those four life
[11:12] Messengers intertwined in that is these
[11:15] virtues
[11:17] because what's what started
[11:19] on the day of Pentecost is definitely
[11:21] what's going to carry us through all
[11:23] right the Holy Ghost falling in a group
[11:25] of Believers and they acted like Jesus
[11:27] Christ all right you can take the seals
[11:29] of all the plagues Daniel 70 weeks you
[11:31] can take all that and we've we know we
[11:34] preached it right here and we know that
[11:35] it's being taught well but if we don't
[11:38] live the life
[11:40] that's where brother Brown said we're
[11:41] we're missing it we're missing it on
[11:43] that life and even Paul said you can
[11:45] know all Mysteries and not have charity
[11:47] which is the new birth then you're a
[11:49] sounding brass and a tinkling symbol so
[11:51] let's bow our heads and remember these
[11:53] ones that are not here we'll miss seeing
[11:55] them
[11:56] Lord I pray that you'd be with each one
[11:58] Lord
[12:00] Susan's mom Lord we forgot about her
[12:02] Lord just bless her
[12:04] where she's at now father I pray that
[12:06] you would just touch each one that's not
[12:07] here with us Lord there's many ones that
[12:10] are sick there's many ones that are
[12:11] struggling Lord let's let's not forget
[12:13] those that are struggling Lord to even
[12:15] try to get to church father and I pray
[12:17] that you'd be with them Lord
[12:19] give them a spark in their heart father
[12:21] and give us a renewed spark tonight Lord
[12:24] and give us something you said you would
[12:27] receive power so Lord after the Holy
[12:30] Ghost has come Lord let's let's just
[12:32] release some of that power tonight Lord
[12:35] it'll help each and every one of us Lord
[12:36] maybe not so much as as screaming and
[12:39] scouting and speaking in tongues and all
[12:41] these things but we'll have a settling
[12:43] in our heart that when we go home and
[12:45] and when the storm clouds gets real bad
[12:48] like it was this morning it looked
[12:49] really bad
[12:51] all of a sudden the sun breaks through
[12:53] father I pray the Breakthrough in our
[12:55] life tonight Lord and that whatever
[12:58] gloominess that we've seen Lord before
[13:00] in the day before we walked in this door
[13:02] it'll be done away with Lord Into
[13:05] Sunshine the s-o-n will shine Lord and
[13:07] give us that warmth that we need to
[13:10] fight the battle
[13:11] for us to get out of here with Lord and
[13:13] I pray that you'd bless us and eat bless
[13:14] brother Dale sister Dale bless the bride
[13:17] around the world Lord all the ministers
[13:18] and ones that were acquainted with Lord
[13:20] we pray that you touch each one Lord
[13:21] bless him in Jesus name amen
[13:25] the Bible says John 1 1 in the beginning
[13:27] was the word the word was with God and
[13:29] the Word was God and that word was made
[13:31] flesh it's not a substitute it's not
[13:34] we're looking for somebody else I'm
[13:36] looking for my flesh to be used by God
[13:39] I'm looking for your flesh to be used by
[13:41] God and not just to be used by God
[13:43] because a sinner can be used by God
[13:47] Gibson callings we'll look at in just a
[13:49] minute Gibson Collins are without
[13:50] repentance but if God ever dwells inside
[13:52] of you
[13:54] and uses your flesh that's him using
[13:56] your flesh and it is not you it is not I
[14:00] that liveth Paul said but what Christ
[14:03] that liveth in me
[14:04] all right and the Word was made flesh
[14:06] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[14:08] glory the glory the only begotten of the
[14:09] father full of grace and truth we'll
[14:12] read one more and you'll be seated John
[14:13] 3 verse 3 says Jesus answered the sin
[14:15] unto him verily verily I say unto thee
[14:18] except the man be born again
[14:20] he cannot see or understand and
[14:23] literally he's not going to be able to
[14:24] see
[14:25] you're not going to heaven if you don't
[14:27] have the new birth I mean you're not
[14:28] going in that City if you don't have the
[14:29] new birth you're not going to be bride
[14:30] if you don't have the new birth that's
[14:32] the kingdom of God all right you may be
[14:34] seated in the Lord at his Blessing to
[14:36] the reading of the word and we've
[14:37] continued on now I want to
[14:39] um break this down just to just a little
[14:41] bit I looked in the uh
[14:43] um online and was was we've always shown
[14:47] this as being born again which is an
[14:49] ongoing thing but I want to I want you
[14:51] to read something that that that that
[14:53] you know that word being could be you
[14:55] you're a being
[14:56] all right but it is a it is a I don't
[15:00] know where they call it an adjective or
[15:01] something but it it's something else
[15:03] it's an action word it's being born
[15:05] again you're you're being activated or
[15:08] you're you're you know you're being
[15:09] reborn or being born again and Paul
[15:12] tells us being born again not of
[15:15] corruptible seed but of Incorruptible so
[15:17] how can we take something corruptable
[15:19] and make it incorruptible
[15:22] by the word of God all right by the word
[15:24] of God which liveth and abideth forever
[15:27] and that word being born again is begott
[15:32] again or be born again or to produce
[15:34] again all right now what's going to
[15:36] happen when we look at this
[15:39] when we look at this butterfly now
[15:41] remember the butterfly the cycle of the
[15:44] butterfly the butterfly the adult
[15:46] butterfly lays an egg
[15:48] it looks nothing like the butterfly
[15:52] don't go to sleep already
[15:55] all right it don't look nothing like it
[15:57] the next stage don't look nothing like
[15:59] it the next stage don't look nothing
[16:00] like it but that last stage it
[16:03] reproduces itself come on somebody it
[16:06] reproduces itself it's Reborn
[16:09] and then you see exactly what
[16:13] planted a seed in the first place
[16:15] so to produce again are born Anew so
[16:19] every day we need a being born again we
[16:24] need something that is renewing us as
[16:27] Paul says by the renewing of your mind
[16:29] how you going to renew your mind you're
[16:31] not going to renew it with anything but
[16:33] the word of God preaching teaching and
[16:36] speaking of the word of God and praying
[16:38] and reading your Bible all right it's
[16:40] the only way you're going to get it
[16:41] you're not going to get it any other way
[16:42] so you can try to find it somewhere else
[16:43] but it's not you're not going to find it
[16:46] you might find a substitute
[16:48] I was talking to a girl um she's a
[16:50] phenomenal Christian girl there we're at
[16:52] home and and she said you know she said
[16:55] before my daddy passed away he was a
[16:57] Pentecostal preacher
[16:59] um he said you know he said he started
[17:01] watching Joyce Myers and see if he got
[17:03] more out of Joyce Meyers than anybody
[17:04] either I said a Pentecostal
[17:07] got anyway so I just kind of looked at
[17:10] her and a little strange and didn't say
[17:12] anything I didn't want to burst or
[17:13] bubble but you see that's what they're
[17:15] leaning to they're leaning to a feeling
[17:17] or an emotion or somebody popular
[17:19] somebody you know it's got you know a
[17:21] crowd of people and and they've got 50
[17:24] 000 views on YouTube or or what more and
[17:27] and you know you look at Joyce Meyers
[17:29] and her hair is about shorter than mine
[17:30] and and you know what brother Brown said
[17:32] about a short-haired woman a bob-head
[17:34] woman so I I just don't have any time
[17:36] for that you know what spend my time
[17:39] looking at the word of God I wish those
[17:41] people that were bashing brother random
[17:43] and believe the sign people I wish
[17:45] they'd spend as much time showing their
[17:48] gospel
[17:49] if our gospel is wrong show me yours
[17:52] don't don't show me 30 minutes of why
[17:54] yours is wrong or mine's wrong you know
[17:57] give me something give me something to
[17:59] help something to edify
[18:01] and look and help us being born again
[18:04] all right because it's a renewing it is
[18:07] a renewing it's something that how many
[18:09] times have we been through life and
[18:11] we've done something done something then
[18:13] we used to do it every day then we used
[18:15] to do it every week and then we started
[18:17] doing it every month and then
[18:21] well didn't you I I just got tired of
[18:23] that well the word of God should never
[18:25] be that way the word of God should be
[18:27] that that I want to be here to where if
[18:29] I listen to a minister and he says
[18:31] something and it Sparks me and I go and
[18:34] I I study on it or I or I um meditate on
[18:38] something and that's the way you should
[18:39] do you say well that's just for the
[18:40] ministers no that's what we're here for
[18:42] is to stir you up so that you'll study
[18:46] where I don't have to study for you
[18:49] all right and you you have to write the
[18:51] man you can do your own studying you
[18:54] have your own books you have your own
[18:56] tapes you have your own prayer life all
[18:58] right
[19:01] you must be born again brother Brown
[19:03] says now God bless his word and I want
[19:05] to take the subject this morning in
[19:07] Jesus's first Doctrine now his first
[19:09] Doctrine now if it was his first
[19:10] Doctrine then it must be our first
[19:12] Doctrine you must be born again
[19:14] that was his first Doctrine we find out
[19:16] that there are so many different
[19:17] meanings I've been talking about this
[19:20] but there is I want you to get it out of
[19:21] your mind it is being justified it is
[19:26] being Sanctified it is coming to the New
[19:30] Birth and continuing on that is the new
[19:33] birth is the continuation of the word of
[19:37] God being made alive in your life
[19:39] hey brother Bob stands here on Sunday
[19:41] teaching Sunday school and and last
[19:44] Sunday you know in that 30 minutes
[19:46] brother Bob did a an outstanding job
[19:48] I've been on I've been on brotherly
[19:50] kindness for you know three or four or
[19:52] five sermons and he popped it all in 30
[19:54] minutes so uh and that's just God I mean
[19:57] and it Sparks your attention and he gets
[19:59] it gets you to study it again
[20:01] all right don't ever leave a subject
[20:03] every subject's got something connected
[20:05] with the other one don't leave one you
[20:07] just come back to the because you're
[20:09] going to come right around to the same
[20:10] subject again and if you know the Bible
[20:13] even tells us if you're plowing in a
[20:15] field don't look back
[20:17] right no look by if you're plowing in
[20:19] the field you get in that Furrow and you
[20:21] plow don't look back because if you look
[20:23] back what you're going to do you're
[20:24] going to be like this
[20:26] but stay in that Furrow if we're in that
[20:28] Furrow of Brotherly kindness man I you
[20:30] know I did I said there Sunday and I
[20:32] said
[20:33] good grief I didn't touch
[20:35] pieces of it from some of the things
[20:37] that brother Bob was bringing out
[20:39] about brotherly kindness brother
[20:41] kindness is the deep subject brother
[20:43] kindness is the subject that's right up
[20:44] there at the very top and it's very
[20:46] narrow and it's going to be hard for us
[20:48] to get to that and through that why
[20:50] because we're contrary even born again
[20:53] believers
[20:55] you're still contrary to the word of God
[20:58] you're still born and sin you can't get
[21:00] away from that you you have a carnal
[21:02] mind
[21:04] all right and that's enmity to God so
[21:06] you got to get that mind get the mind of
[21:09] Christ to override that mind
[21:11] all right
[21:12] and don't be double-minded right now the
[21:15] Bible tells us about a double-minded man
[21:17] we find that there's many different
[21:19] meanings that people put to that
[21:22] nearly all churches say You must be born
[21:24] again that's kind of the basis of
[21:26] Christianity but what are they saying I
[21:28] read a few I looked up being born again
[21:30] in on a Googled it and and my there is I
[21:34] mean you can read for days
[21:36] what the definition of being born again
[21:38] is but thank God he sent us a prophet
[21:41] that told us when Jesus stood said you
[21:43] must be born again he says if he said
[21:45] what inside of you
[21:47] a Grace with the word for your day
[21:50] in other words brings you to church
[21:52] makes you read your Bible makes you
[21:54] study do the things of the of the word
[21:56] of God
[21:58] to me
[21:59] that is my only I mean how are you going
[22:02] to do it by feelings
[22:04] how are you going to do it by any
[22:06] emotion
[22:07] How You Gonna you can't but it is by an
[22:10] experience there's got to come a day
[22:13] folks when it's just like reaching and
[22:14] getting that doorknob there's a key
[22:16] there's a knob and there's a bolt that
[22:19] goes in that door
[22:21] all right that is the integral parts of
[22:24] a doorknob
[22:25] well that's the integral parts of being
[22:26] born again but what do you got to do you
[22:28] got to go over there and turn that knob
[22:30] something happened
[22:33] right
[22:34] this is old you
[22:39] that's your birth that's that's too
[22:41] simple well guess what I wish you could
[22:43] make it that simple
[22:45] you took what you got
[22:48] turned it
[22:51] you hear that
[22:53] it opened that Bolt
[22:58] and you let somebody in
[23:03] but but without that without the Turning
[23:07] of that Bolt
[23:09] the same you stand at the door
[23:12] so it's an experience I had an
[23:15] experience you saw me walk over there
[23:16] and open that door and what'd it do it
[23:19] changed the atmosphere actually when I
[23:21] opened it it did change the atmosphere
[23:22] because that hot air started coming in
[23:24] but it changed the atmosphere it changed
[23:26] where I was and it would change my whole
[23:28] point of this whole room when that door
[23:30] opened because anything can come in
[23:31] anything can get out
[23:33] so nearly all churches say You must be
[23:35] born again but each one has their
[23:36] different interpretation well you just
[23:38] saw ours it's opening the door
[23:40] turn the doorknob
[23:43] but it's an experience that you have
[23:46] so you can put it with whatever you want
[23:48] to put it with but it's got to be you
[23:50] got to say this is where I was born
[23:53] again at
[23:56] every one of your sisters know exactly
[23:58] where you were when you gave birth to
[24:00] your children
[24:02] no I can't remember
[24:05] you may have been knocked out for days
[24:06] but you can still remember where you're
[24:08] at but that's the experience you had an
[24:11] experience of childbirth all right
[24:15] so how do you interpret it I would go to
[24:17] each church and then his brother I'm
[24:18] telling just a whole Congregation of of
[24:21] denominational people
[24:23] look there's gotta be one way
[24:26] there must be a truth somewhere
[24:29] so now remember it didn't say you ought
[24:31] to be it says You must
[24:33] now you must be born again 1961.
[24:36] as I was saying before about the door
[24:38] that and that doorknob stays the same
[24:40] until you turn it it's locked all right
[24:42] you still
[24:44] are what you are until you're born again
[24:47] of the spirit of God it does not change
[24:49] you what saying a Creed coming to church
[24:52] reading your Bible
[24:54] even that it will
[24:56] but your Creed joining the church change
[24:58] your idea
[25:00] a lot of people are at that point they
[25:02] just have good intentions
[25:04] all right or as we say find Jesus in
[25:07] jail you just get caught doing what
[25:08] you're doing you get feel sorry about it
[25:11] and you feel sorry for getting caught
[25:13] not that somebody that was a devil in
[25:15] there that made you do it and guess what
[25:17] you're going to go right back and do it
[25:18] again
[25:19] but that new birth is an experience
[25:21] something that takes place there was
[25:25] something that turned that opened up a
[25:28] door that God could get inside of you
[25:31] and do what not just move you over
[25:35] not just move you over
[25:38] kill you
[25:40] fire Holy Ghost and Fire he's going to
[25:42] burn that thing out and he's literally
[25:45] in your soul he is rebirthing you I
[25:49] don't care if you're 90 years old as the
[25:52] woman was she was 90 something years old
[25:54] when she came to the lord well when she
[25:56] got born again God didn't put a 92 year
[25:58] old woman back in there no he renewed
[26:01] her
[26:02] he made her to where that her theophany
[26:05] just changed right to a young person
[26:08] I just I just believe that
[26:12] because how you gonna get the eternal
[26:14] life that you're going to live in for an
[26:16] eternity and it's be old
[26:20] the reason you're old is because your
[26:21] mom and daddy brought you here
[26:25] but when that Soul comes inside of you
[26:27] and God changes not exchange
[26:29] he didn't kill your soul he kills and
[26:32] burns that nature that you had because
[26:34] you had a carnal mind because you came
[26:36] from sex just like the next person did
[26:38] and the next person did and everybody in
[26:40] here
[26:41] come from the same Act
[26:44] and you're dying because of that one act
[26:48] but if you're sitting here today born
[26:50] again you were made alive
[26:52] by the same act right
[26:56] and that's God birthing you into the
[26:57] body
[26:58] but the reason we have to be born again
[26:59] because the Bible teaches us that we're
[27:01] all born in sin shaped and iniquity
[27:03] see that's why I love about brother
[27:05] Brown he just lays it out there he said
[27:07] I was born in sin
[27:09] a prophet
[27:11] I was going to hell
[27:15] he didn't say now I'm different I'm
[27:17] special I'm Malachi 4. no he did not
[27:21] he said I'm lost he said everybody's
[27:24] lost till they're born again we're all
[27:26] together wrong to begin with and there's
[27:28] nothing we can do about it
[27:30] there's nothing we can do about getting
[27:32] here wrong but there is something we can
[27:34] do about getting here right while we're
[27:36] here now all right everybody with me on
[27:38] this
[27:39] now remember all those people
[27:44] they were
[27:47] what we call
[27:49] Abraham the father of our faith I was
[27:51] thinking about this the other day about
[27:52] Moses and different ones
[27:54] sometimes maybe the Lord will let you if
[27:57] you'll ask him he'll let you just really
[27:59] get into the life of that person
[28:02] and that may just be me
[28:04] but I just kind of got into you know you
[28:06] get into the life of Moses
[28:08] and you get into that and what we read
[28:10] is okay but there was a God that was
[28:13] motivating that
[28:15] all right so that same God that spoke to
[28:17] him at the burning bush is the one that
[28:19] spoke to me the day I got born again and
[28:21] he's not just living around me or with
[28:24] me he's inside of me all right see
[28:27] that's something Moses couldn't say
[28:29] because Moses wanted to meet him he
[28:31] wanted to know where he was he wanted to
[28:33] figure him out
[28:35] though he made him at a burning bush but
[28:37] he met fire he didn't meet a person he
[28:39] wanted to meet a person
[28:41] but because of the blood of bulls and
[28:43] goats he couldn't see that person Faith
[28:45] remember he saw his back part
[28:48] he said you can't see my face and live
[28:51] well guess what we can see his face
[28:54] today and live
[28:56] when you get born again you're looking
[28:59] at the face of God
[29:01] if you're really born again
[29:04] but all these having a good report all
[29:06] these different ones that the whole Old
[29:08] Testament is just full of these people
[29:09] neither one of them are born again
[29:12] not a one of them got their old nature
[29:15] burnout and the nature of God put in
[29:18] that person
[29:19] no there was gifts it was Gifts of
[29:22] anointings of coming on and coming off
[29:24] we're going to see here in just a few
[29:25] minutes even Jesus told the 12 disciples
[29:27] he said I'm going to give you power
[29:31] to lay hands on the sick
[29:34] preach the gospel and Judas was there
[29:37] and remember he didn't have nothing in
[29:39] him but the devil obviously all right
[29:43] everybody with me
[29:46] but he gave him power like Susie excuse
[29:49] you he gave him an anointing he gave him
[29:51] something to work with
[29:53] but when you get dunamis power is where
[29:56] Peter didn't need Jesus the day at the
[30:00] gate beautiful
[30:02] come on he didn't need the person
[30:05] he had that person inside of it
[30:08] he said Silver and Gold Have I None but
[30:10] I have received that promise
[30:15] God having some better things for us to
[30:17] stay without us
[30:19] cannot
[30:20] and will not be made perfect
[30:23] without a group of people because
[30:25] remember as we were talking before and I
[30:27] was listening brother random the other
[30:28] day he said everybody got a piece
[30:31] listen we're not peace people
[30:34] p-i-e-c-e
[30:39] we're full adoption every joint supplied
[30:44] everything that moves is God
[30:47] everything that breatheses God
[30:50] in this end time we are looking at The
[30:53] Headstone the head we are not looking at
[30:55] pieces of the body
[30:56] as God saw pieces of the body and was
[30:59] happy when Martin Luther
[31:01] you know he did that in October I think
[31:03] what was it October he put those thesis
[31:05] 95 thesis
[31:09] but remember
[31:11] his new birth
[31:12] is not your new birth as far as that
[31:16] part of the word
[31:17] all right just shall live by faith all
[31:19] right
[31:20] not anything of sanctification but
[31:23] remember it was the butterfly adult had
[31:27] planted an egg
[31:30] all right so potentially
[31:32] that was a butterfly potentially it was
[31:36] headed toward full word
[31:38] potentially when I put corn in the
[31:41] ground if the stinking deer don't eat it
[31:43] all we're going to eat them vegetables
[31:46] they might be in a different form but
[31:48] I have got zero P's
[31:51] zero okra
[31:54] and they beat the tops off my corn
[31:57] they're dying
[32:00] I'm gonna eat them peas and all but it
[32:01] may be in a form of meat but I'm gonna
[32:03] eat them things
[32:04] but they tore my garden up bad
[32:07] but anyway so but what I planted I had I
[32:10] had good intentions but what I planted
[32:13] was going to come up The Corn was
[32:14] supposed to come up to a grain and then
[32:17] that grain you dried it out and put it
[32:19] up and next year you planted it it
[32:21] looked like what went in the ground but
[32:24] the stages all did not look like that
[32:27] one grain of of corn
[32:29] but that life of the grain of corn was
[32:32] inside there and that's what we're going
[32:33] to look at in just a minute that's the
[32:34] same thing with our birth and then when
[32:37] being born again when we look at these
[32:39] virtues they must be something special
[32:42] that is given to us
[32:45] all right because not everybody's going
[32:47] to get them
[32:48] listen the potential for the butterflies
[32:50] there but when you get to that
[32:52] caterpillar stage if a caterpillar does
[32:55] not eat
[32:58] it will not produce a butterfly yet it
[33:00] is a caterpillar and got a butterfly
[33:02] inside of it
[33:04] it will die
[33:06] because it's not eaten
[33:08] that's 238 Peter said repent and be
[33:10] baptized every one of you in the name of
[33:12] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[33:13] and you shall receive the gift
[33:15] the Holy Ghost for that promises unto
[33:18] you and to your children to all that are
[33:20] far off and even means our Lord Our God
[33:21] shall call Our Promise is not again it's
[33:24] not partial promise our promise is full
[33:27] Authority full nature of God full
[33:32] headstone not pieces or parts
[33:36] man right
[33:38] that's our mandate that's what I come to
[33:40] church for
[33:42] sure I come to church to get my little
[33:44] portion but my little portion is a
[33:46] hundred percent of what I need
[33:48] and I'm heading toward and you are
[33:50] heading toward a peace you're starting
[33:52] with a peace but you're heading to a
[33:54] full body
[33:57] you're going to be the one that's going
[33:58] to see the perfection
[34:00] we're the ones that's going to be able
[34:02] to see I just believe in the name of the
[34:03] Lord we're going to be able to see the
[34:05] body change
[34:07] we're going to be able to look at it and
[34:09] become part of it not just say oh that's
[34:12] for another age there is no other age
[34:15] this is it
[34:21] I mean listen
[34:22] I was thinking about this so that's a
[34:24] little bit carnal but
[34:25] you watch a football game and it's like
[34:28] 60 Minutes long all right
[34:30] so you watch a football game and and you
[34:33] know they're out there and they
[34:36] and they got like 30 or 45 seconds to
[34:38] run a play you know in there they just
[34:41] take your dear sweet time until the last
[34:43] two minutes of the game
[34:45] right in the last two minutes of the
[34:48] game they know oh when that clock goes
[34:50] zero zero zero game's over
[34:54] but before that they're looking at 59 58
[34:57] 57 you know they're looking at 59
[34:58] minutes they're like we're good come on
[35:02] hike the ball but last two minutes
[35:05] it's a flurry
[35:07] especially if you're behind
[35:11] right
[35:12] you watch any kind of game any kind they
[35:14] get right up to the last inning or the
[35:16] last play of the last few minutes of a
[35:18] soccer game or something like that and I
[35:20] couldn't tell you the first minute or
[35:21] last minute of a soccer game but
[35:24] they call it football too huh
[35:27] Adam I don't know
[35:29] ain't football
[35:32] but think about it that's what we're at
[35:34] now
[35:35] this is it there is no other quarter
[35:37] there's no other game there's no other
[35:39] time
[35:40] and listen we don't even get overtime
[35:45] if you go into overtime you are a
[35:47] foolish virgin
[35:49] and you didn't win the game all right
[35:51] this is it we're coming to the zero zero
[35:54] zero
[35:56] now I believe that the reason that
[35:58] there's so much confusion about the Holy
[36:00] Spirit is not correctly tall so let's
[36:02] just
[36:03] continue on because we know we were just
[36:05] talking about it but we're thank God for
[36:08] a proheart
[36:14] with that nature that you were born with
[36:16] contrary to God
[36:19] every bit of it was contrary to God I
[36:21] don't care how sweet and nice and
[36:23] wonderful you are
[36:26] without the new birth and without God
[36:29] putting something in you your dad
[36:34] take the Stony heart out of your flesh
[36:36] he's the only one that can do that
[36:38] and I will give you a heart of Flesh and
[36:41] I will put my spirit listen to me that's
[36:45] god making sure that you make it
[36:50] if you take something imperfect
[36:53] and put something perfect in it
[36:57] you're gonna make it
[36:59] amen he's going to make sure you're
[37:00] going to make it that's where election
[37:02] and predestination and foreknowledge all
[37:05] comes together
[37:07] somebody's going to make it he saw
[37:09] somebody want it so bad
[37:11] so he didn't put you in Luther's age he
[37:13] didn't put you in Wesley's age he puts
[37:15] you in Pentecost he puts you 60 years
[37:18] ago in a prophet's message
[37:20] sitting in the
[37:22] Tabernacle or whatever more he put you
[37:25] right here
[37:26] more blessed is him that what
[37:28] have not seen and believe
[37:31] all right
[37:33] but he's going to make sure we're going
[37:35] to make it he said I'm going to put my
[37:36] spirit within you and cause you
[37:40] you know if I put a spirit of uh sister
[37:43] Barbara's not here tonight so I'll talk
[37:44] about her just I'm sure she's watching
[37:47] but she's so Meek and Mild I have to get
[37:50] real close to listen yeah I know y'all
[37:51] do too not one of y'all never heard her
[37:53] talk loud
[37:56] not a one amen
[37:58] you're all like what
[38:01] oh I got okay
[38:04] what
[38:07] really excited the other day
[38:09] can you speak up a little bit
[38:11] but that's just her but put me inside of
[38:13] her
[38:17] now wouldn't that be
[38:19] because you're going never
[38:22] but that's what God does though
[38:25] he puts himself inside of you and makes
[38:27] you act like him
[38:29] right
[38:31] she's probably passed out now on the
[38:34] floor
[38:36] Sister Barbara he's okay you'll not have
[38:39] to be like me I can talk I can talk loud
[38:42] so you don't have to
[38:44] but that's what God does or if we'll
[38:46] believe that
[38:49] we're supposed to remember there's
[38:50] Christians in Antioch they called them
[38:52] Christians because they acted like
[38:56] Christ there was a group of people that
[38:58] had you know even from afar off saw this
[39:01] man named Jesus didn't understand him
[39:03] but saw his life for 30 years
[39:07] probably didn't even believe in him but
[39:09] he they then he disappears come on
[39:12] somebody he disappears goes off the
[39:14] scene we don't know what happened to him
[39:16] we think he went out in the desert we
[39:18] think this happened we think they stole
[39:20] his body or they well now he just went
[39:22] up and come right back down in those
[39:24] people and made them Act like he acted
[39:28] so they connected the two together
[39:33] they must have been around that man
[39:34] Jesus because they're acting just like
[39:36] him
[39:37] Peter says Silver and Gold Have I done
[39:40] but such as I can call the Bishop no he
[39:43] didn't say that churches I have today
[39:45] give unto you
[39:49] amen I like what Peter Peter was you
[39:51] know how he was real he's always with
[39:53] bold
[39:54] but he said you know he walks by and he
[39:56] walked by this guy and he says this
[39:58] guy's you know wanting alms and all this
[40:00] stuff Peter being Peter
[40:03] he looked at him and he said
[40:05] look on us
[40:07] wasn't making him anything but what he
[40:09] was doing was doing just like where
[40:10] brother Brandon would do
[40:12] be still
[40:15] look up here brother Adam said you look
[40:18] up here
[40:19] he said now if I tell you to close your
[40:21] eyes you close your eyes
[40:22] he said I take every Spirit In My
[40:25] Control in this building
[40:27] all right well that's what Peter was
[40:28] doing he was he was taking the scene and
[40:30] he was controlling the scene he said
[40:32] look on us
[40:35] he said now what I got I'm fixing to
[40:37] give you I don't have enough to pay you
[40:39] doctor bills I can't heal you but I know
[40:41] there's one inside of me that will if
[40:43] you'll just calm down
[40:46] and look on us
[40:48] think about that
[40:50] there's a lot of times and I and I'm not
[40:52] for it or against it and it has its time
[40:55] but but all this jumping and dancing and
[40:57] singing and shouting and running the
[40:59] owls that there is a place for that but
[41:02] I believe when somebody needs to get
[41:03] healed or gets prayed for it needs to be
[41:06] quiet
[41:08] getting to be it needs to be it you tell
[41:11] me one time where brother Branham ever
[41:13] said now y'all just continue screaming
[41:16] and shouting no he's always saying calm
[41:18] down sit down I'll read it to you I read
[41:19] it to you last Wednesday sit down
[41:22] he said the Holy Ghost is timid he said
[41:24] you need to sit down sit still don't
[41:26] move
[41:27] now he didn't mind him praising the Lord
[41:29] you saw on that movie where that black
[41:30] sister stood up and he said thank God
[41:32] for you black people
[41:34] praising the Lord you know which was
[41:37] fine but it wasn't the whole building
[41:38] where you couldn't even hear what
[41:39] brother Brown was saying there's got to
[41:41] be a control to it where where Peter
[41:43] says look hey look right here look look
[41:45] at us
[41:47] all right so let's continue on but
[41:49] that's just something we need to be
[41:50] taught more of
[41:51] maybe to get more out of it
[41:54] I've just seen you know for nine years
[41:57] June and I were were counselors at camp
[42:00] at Alabama and and the same ones every
[42:03] year came to the altar screamed shouted
[42:06] you know fell out
[42:09] XYZ whatever you want to say and then
[42:12] they disappeared
[42:14] you'd see him a year same two years and
[42:16] then gone
[42:17] hear that they were out in the world you
[42:19] know doing XYZ well
[42:23] maybe if somebody would have got down
[42:24] there and and talked to him
[42:27] one-on-one just talk to them
[42:30] said hey
[42:31] you know be still
[42:33] don't be just don't be screaming
[42:36] y'all don't get quiet if you want to but
[42:37] that's just the way I see that the Lord
[42:39] deals with us there is a time to rejoice
[42:41] and scream and shout amen there is a
[42:44] time for that but you got to know what
[42:46] you're screaming and shouting for
[42:50] getting these meetings and the people
[42:52] are already shouting amen before the guy
[42:54] even preaches well he could say 10
[42:55] things wrong and they'd be shouting
[42:57] already
[42:57] all right Luke 24 49 says behold I send
[43:01] the promise of my father upon you but
[43:04] tarry you in the city of Jerusalem until
[43:06] you be endued with power
[43:08] from on high that word in dude means to
[43:10] put on clothes with a raid in or be
[43:13] clothed in a sense of sinking into a
[43:16] garment
[43:18] which is dunamis power which is inherent
[43:22] power now that's what we want because we
[43:24] are inheritors
[43:26] all right but now this other power is
[43:28] when we called him he gave 12 disciples
[43:30] power against unclean spirits cast them
[43:33] out heal all manner of sickness and all
[43:34] manner of disease now that powers exosia
[43:37] or he he gave them Authority but what
[43:40] happened with that Authority when they
[43:43] hung Jesus on the cross
[43:45] where'd that Authority go
[43:49] they weren't even around at his death
[43:52] they scattered everywhere
[43:55] and Judas is the one that turned him in
[43:57] so he had exclusive power which was
[44:00] power that came on and off just like we
[44:02] would at a meeting or anything like that
[44:04] you would have power it's even Power of
[44:07] Choice Liberty to do as one pleases the
[44:10] Lord Jesus gave them Liberty to heal the
[44:12] sick
[44:13] raise the dead do all the different
[44:15] things he gave them power which was a
[44:17] temporary power but then what happened
[44:19] it didn't stay on them it just went away
[44:23] but now in the day of Pentecost that
[44:25] dunamis power that came and went inside
[44:28] of them is the one that gave Peter
[44:30] authority to do what he did
[44:33] he didn't need exclusive power anymore
[44:36] he had xoc I mean he had the dunamis
[44:39] power not the EXO see he had dunamis
[44:41] power and he walked around with it you
[44:43] and I got to realize we walk around with
[44:46] the power of God every second of our
[44:48] life if you're born again
[44:51] believe me if you're born again you've
[44:53] got the power over the devil inside of
[44:55] you waiting to be used not waiting to to
[44:59] come to church where you can get
[45:01] anointed
[45:04] it's good to be here you should and you
[45:07] will if you're a Christian
[45:13] John truly baptized with water and this
[45:15] is Peter I mean this is Paul
[45:17] but you shall be baptized with the Holy
[45:19] Ghost not me today I mean this is Jesus
[45:20] you'll be baptized with the Holy Ghost
[45:22] not many days hence and then that's what
[45:25] happened they went to the death on up on
[45:27] the day of Pentecost but you shall
[45:29] receive power after that the Holy Ghost
[45:32] has come upon you because what happened
[45:34] this quote from Brother Branham is just
[45:36] I I used to underline it
[45:39] a lot when I was reading a church age
[45:41] book because it says remember Christ in
[45:43] the true church
[45:44] is a continuation of what happened in
[45:48] the book of Acts so I just gave you
[45:50] examples Paul
[45:51] Peter John James all the different ones
[45:54] but the Book of Revelation shows how
[45:56] that the Antichrist Spirit would come
[45:58] into that church the real Church
[46:02] defile it make it lukewarm formal and
[46:05] Powerless what teach that the Holy Ghost
[46:07] was in a wafer or in a priest or in the
[46:11] preacher or in this or in that and not
[46:13] in them
[46:18] like what somebody said the other day
[46:20] and it's true uh but the denominations
[46:24] uh and the one denominations in this
[46:27] message you know they can get Jesus
[46:30] to to be our savior and and to you know
[46:33] to down across for us but they can't
[46:35] really get them inside of them
[46:38] they look back at something happen and
[46:40] said well he died on the cross
[46:42] but they can't get that same man
[46:46] because if that same man would go inside
[46:49] of them that would be the baptism of the
[46:51] Holy Ghost the new birth and it would
[46:54] change them
[46:58] they would not have exclusive power they
[47:01] would have dunamis power but they don't
[47:02] but it's made but it's made the church
[47:04] called formal powerless
[47:07] so but look at this the kingdom of God
[47:09] is the word of God made back in power
[47:12] whatever you can think about what
[47:14] brother random did he came to bring the
[47:17] power back in the church
[47:21] because the word of God was so diluted
[47:24] it was so changed
[47:29] praise the Lord it was
[47:32] man had got involved with all their
[47:34] ideas and their doctrines
[47:38] with no Paul he says look if you
[47:40] received the Holy Ghost since you
[47:41] believe I wish somebody would go around
[47:42] all the message churches and preach that
[47:46] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[47:47] you believe this message
[47:49] since you've come into this I don't want
[47:52] to say tent and cause you to have a tent
[47:55] Ministry tent Vision sorry don't believe
[47:58] in none of that
[47:59] this is the tent that I'm worried about
[48:01] I'm not worried about some tent coming
[48:02] over this way all right right I know we
[48:04] all are I just want to make sure
[48:06] somebody on the video knows that uh we
[48:09] ain't looking for no tent
[48:11] we are the town of God
[48:14] but if you're seeing the Holy Ghost
[48:15] since you believe this message since you
[48:17] sat for years and years and years like
[48:19] brother Dale always said and it's so
[48:21] profound he said I'd rather
[48:23] come to church
[48:27] drag my nails all over the girl you know
[48:29] pulling myself in
[48:31] and say God give me the Holy Ghost
[48:34] God give me the new birth and to find
[48:38] out I had it already
[48:40] than to come in and oh bless God I'm I'm
[48:43] gonna sit over next to Bob because I
[48:44] know I know me and Bob got it you know
[48:46] and I'm gonna sit next to him
[48:50] did y'all realize something Sunday do
[48:52] you realize something
[48:53] I'll tell you how let me tell you how
[48:55] let me tell you how people work
[48:57] look at all his pictures that he put up
[49:01] except for one it was a man with a beard
[49:06] you go look at it and say I thought man
[49:08] a bunch of guys with beards in it
[49:11] because Bob was teaching because he had
[49:12] a beard that's why but it's what you see
[49:15] and there's nothing wrong with that but
[49:17] I was just going man they all got beards
[49:20] hey the greatest preacher I ever knew
[49:22] had a beard
[49:23] that's what I told Dan daisley one time
[49:25] he told me he said if you'll shave your
[49:26] beard he said I'll let you preach for me
[49:29] I said well the best preacher I ever
[49:30] heard in my life the greatest preacher
[49:32] on the face of this Earth had a beard he
[49:34] said who in his little wife she's a
[49:37] Hispanic lady she's sitting there and I
[49:39] said Jesus Christ and she said I guess
[49:41] he told you
[49:44] so I preached for him a couple weeks
[49:45] later
[49:48] so have you received the Holy Ghost
[49:49] since you believe this message since
[49:51] you've come in and and got the to me got
[49:54] the emotion out of the way got to got
[49:56] everything just just laid out
[49:59] get under some good teaching get under
[50:02] some good Revelation all right
[50:05] because look these people said look
[50:07] we've been preaching this message for
[50:09] years we don't know what you're talking
[50:11] about they you need to get the Holy
[50:13] Ghost we thought it was the message no
[50:15] it's not
[50:20] but then we look in Ephesians 4
[50:22] says let no corrupt now you say how can
[50:25] I grieve the Holy Spirit Paul lays it
[50:28] out in verse 29 and 31. if you'll watch
[50:32] Paul when he's writing his letters
[50:33] remember he's writing letters he's not
[50:36] this is not verse 29.
[50:38] or verse 30s everybody understand what
[50:40] I'm talking about this is not Ephesians
[50:42] 4. man put those in there and put those
[50:45] breaks in that but it was a continual
[50:47] letter so Paul's listen continue a
[50:50] letter all right let no corrupt
[50:51] communication proceed out of your mouth
[50:54] but that which is good to the use of
[50:55] edifying that it may Minister Grace into
[50:57] the hearers and grieve not the holy
[50:59] spirit of God whereby you are sailed
[51:01] until the day of your Redemption let all
[51:03] bitterness and wrath he's continuing his
[51:05] thought he's telling you if you have
[51:07] bitterness you've grieved the Holy
[51:09] Spirit
[51:10] if you have wrath you've grieved the
[51:12] Holy Spirit if you have corrupt
[51:15] communication you've agreed the Holy
[51:17] Spirit
[51:18] am I okay with that is that all right
[51:22] no anger if you if you're angry Holy
[51:25] Spirit go down a limb
[51:26] clamor
[51:28] evil speaking be put away from you with
[51:31] all malice now watch this is how you
[51:33] bring him back
[51:35] and be you kind
[51:38] brother Bob reading this Sunday be a
[51:40] kind one to another
[51:42] tenderhearted
[51:44] forgiving one another even as God for
[51:47] Christ's sake has forgiven you
[51:50] brother Brown said possession against
[51:52] the enemy
[51:53] 1959 says see the holy spirit is so
[51:56] timid he said be reverent keep quiet now
[51:58] you see he's in prayer line be reverent
[52:00] everybody now just be real Reverend keep
[52:02] quiet see the holy spirit is so timid
[52:04] how many knows that just real timid the
[52:07] Holy Spirit see just any little
[52:09] Interruption bothers him
[52:13] any interruption
[52:16] of that what I just listed of Paul the
[52:18] malice and the strife and the clamor and
[52:21] all get that out of the way
[52:25] it will bother him
[52:27] but we want
[52:29] to get him back guess what do the
[52:31] reverse of whatever that was okay so
[52:33] let's get on to something else right
[52:34] here let's look at this let's look at
[52:36] the anointings of the gifts
[52:38] let's read First Corinthians 12. verse
[52:41] four I kind of this is what I added in
[52:43] when I was sitting in there
[52:44] but now there are diversities of gifts
[52:48] look but the same spirit so we're not
[52:50] getting away from the Holy Spirit we're
[52:52] not getting away from that new birth
[52:54] that we had when we when we got born
[52:56] again you got the new birth now but
[52:59] there are diversities of gifts
[53:02] all right
[53:04] and there are differences of
[53:06] Administrations
[53:08] but the same Lord not everybody can be a
[53:10] deacon or a preacher or Pastor or Elder
[53:13] they're all different diversities
[53:16] but the manifestation of the spirit is
[53:19] given to every man
[53:22] and woman sister
[53:24] to profit
[53:27] with all in other words all the whole
[53:29] Community or the whole church
[53:31] but the manifestation of spirit is given
[53:33] to every man the prophet with all for
[53:35] 2-1 is given by the spirit the word of
[53:38] wisdom
[53:40] it didn't say everyone it said one and
[53:43] that don't mean like one with your
[53:45] finger but one among you
[53:47] one among us all right
[53:50] because listen there's some Among Us me
[53:54] included that don't have all these
[53:55] virtues 100 percent
[53:58] remember we get 30 60 and 100. some get
[54:02] 30 some get 60 some get a hundred
[54:05] some of you have had your temper
[54:07] completely wiped out some of us have not
[54:13] for one is given by the spirit of wisdom
[54:15] Word of Wisdom look to another all right
[54:18] now to another the spirit moves over
[54:20] into another vessel
[54:23] all right to another the word of
[54:25] knowledge look by The Same Spirit though
[54:28] that's how they agree it keeps the same
[54:31] spirit and they agree as the Bible says
[54:35] in one
[54:36] all right to another Faith because look
[54:39] you can look at this in Corinthians and
[54:41] I don't know if this is when when Paul
[54:43] and and and Barnabas had their
[54:47] difference or when Paul and Peter had
[54:49] their difference I don't know the
[54:50] chronology of the writing but remember
[54:52] it was the same they weren't they
[54:55] weren't diverse in Doctrine
[54:57] it was just a little human something
[54:59] that they didn't agree with everybody
[55:01] with me okay all right now listen it's
[55:04] not gonna be peaches and cream I'll
[55:06] promise you that because we're all
[55:08] different
[55:08] to another the word of knowledge by The
[55:11] Same Spirit to another Faith watch he
[55:14] keeps saying by The Same Spirit
[55:18] to another the gifts of healing look by
[55:21] The Same Spirit
[55:23] to another the working of Miracles to
[55:26] another prophecy to another Discerning
[55:28] of spirits to another diverse kinds of
[55:31] tongues or different kinds of tongues to
[55:33] another the interpretation of tongues
[55:35] but all these worketh that one and the
[55:39] self-sane spirit
[55:41] in other words that
[55:43] these gifts
[55:44] gift look dividing to every man
[55:47] severally as he will
[55:50] all right so remember the reason I'm
[55:53] telling you this is because there's two
[55:55] sets of gifts
[55:57] now watch
[55:59] these gifts can be interpreted and they
[56:02] can be not interpreted they can be the
[56:05] devil can brother Brown said pass out
[56:07] spiritual gifts
[56:09] all right
[56:10] because they're not predestinating gifts
[56:12] they're gifts that's given with all to
[56:15] the body all right
[56:17] and gifts and callings or that you just
[56:18] got to remember that
[56:20] but see he may give brother Donnie the
[56:21] gift of wisdom but when Brother Don he's
[56:23] finished with that gift of wisdom I say
[56:25] finished when God's finished with
[56:26] whatever you need to do it may go over
[56:29] to brother Tony
[56:31] everybody with me but it's the same Holy
[56:33] Spirit if they're not if they're not
[56:34] both born again that same spirit's not
[56:36] going to carry it over there
[56:37] okay so you understand what I'm saying
[56:40] we all have diversity of gifts but
[56:45] there is a predestinated as brother Dale
[56:48] said and I've read them read you the
[56:49] quote the predestinated gifts of God
[56:52] stay that way all the time
[56:55] they don't change
[56:57] and that's the fivefold ministry I don't
[56:59] see how in the world people are trying
[57:01] to get that out and it's a predestinated
[57:03] gift it's actually the only one that
[57:06] can't be interpreted by the devil if
[57:09] they preach the word right
[57:12] it can't be imitating yeah well you can
[57:13] have false preachers and teachers but if
[57:15] you have a pre I'm talking about
[57:17] predestinated by God
[57:20] amen if it's predestinated by God he's
[57:23] going to use those vessels in his way
[57:26] and it's going to be right 100 of the
[57:28] time
[57:29] all right
[57:32] remember these gifts are speaking in
[57:34] tongues and interpretation is not always
[57:35] right
[57:38] come on brother Brown was talking about
[57:39] different things like that he said he
[57:41] said you need you got an evil spirit in
[57:43] your church if that if it's one
[57:45] prophesies or interprets and and it gets
[57:48] all confusing he said that's not the
[57:50] Holy Spirit
[57:52] Galatians 5 verse 22 says but the fruit
[57:54] of the spirit is love joy peace
[57:57] long-suffering gentleness goodness Faith
[57:59] let's go right back now to the statue of
[58:01] perfect man meeting his Temperance look
[58:03] against there's such there's no law
[58:07] it's not even covered by the law
[58:10] because it's the fruit of the spirit of
[58:12] God
[58:13] love joy peace long suffering gentleness
[58:16] goodness Faith meeting his Temperance
[58:18] against such
[58:19] there is no law in other words there's
[58:23] therefore now no condemnation
[58:26] because what was the law given for
[58:29] the law was given to condemn you
[58:33] sure Paul is telling us there's
[58:35] therefore now no condemnation to them
[58:38] that are not above the law no no no no
[58:41] no no but have made the law a Living
[58:44] Word of God
[58:47] are you getting it made the law not dead
[58:51] away with the law Jesus couldn't do away
[58:53] with the word of God he came under the
[58:56] law
[58:57] to make it honorable to make it to where
[58:59] if you were born again you're not going
[59:01] to want to kill somebody
[59:03] Commander adultery all those different
[59:05] things
[59:08] but watch there's a group of people just
[59:10] for a minute
[59:11] there's a group of people that's going
[59:13] to use these gifts wrong
[59:16] but they think they're using them right
[59:19] not everyone that saith unto me Lord
[59:21] Lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[59:22] heaven but he that doeth the will of my
[59:25] father
[59:27] which is in heaven many shall he didn't
[59:30] say a few
[59:32] many brother John many will say to me in
[59:36] that day Lord Lord have we not what
[59:39] prophesied
[59:41] cast out devils
[59:44] and in thy name
[59:48] done many wonderful works
[59:50] they didn't do it in the name of the
[59:51] devil
[59:52] they did in the name of God with a
[59:54] different motive
[59:56] and without the new birth they got an
[59:58] anointing they didn't receive the Holy
[1:00:00] Ghost after they believed they just
[1:00:01] believed the message and went on with it
[1:00:03] that's hard to say but
[1:00:06] you preached this message for 30 or 40
[1:00:08] years and walk away from it and say it's
[1:00:10] wrong
[1:00:10] you didn't get the new birth
[1:00:13] I can tell you thus saith the Lord you
[1:00:15] didn't get the new birth
[1:00:17] no cause a new birth the New Birth the
[1:00:20] power of God the dunamis of God will
[1:00:23] never ever now you can say I don't
[1:00:25] understand it
[1:00:27] but you can never deny what came in this
[1:00:29] end time and be born again no way
[1:00:32] no way
[1:00:34] can they come back that's up to God all
[1:00:37] right and in thy name done many
[1:00:40] wonderful words even maybe baptized in
[1:00:42] the name of the Lord Jesus did Mighty
[1:00:44] Works in their name and then I'm
[1:00:46] professing to you I never knew you
[1:00:50] I knew of you
[1:00:53] but I didn't know you intimately
[1:00:56] because an intimate relationship of God
[1:00:58] is when that God comes inside of you I
[1:01:02] know we all understand what I'm talking
[1:01:03] about comes inside of you
[1:01:05] and has an intimate relationship with
[1:01:08] you
[1:01:09] and you too become what one
[1:01:12] he said depart from Ye Ye that work
[1:01:15] iniquity wow please Lord don't let us be
[1:01:19] any of that group
[1:01:21] I want to be that group where he smiles
[1:01:23] at us and says hey you made it
[1:01:25] you made it you made it in the worst age
[1:01:29] and the worst time he
[1:01:32] he I put this one together with this one
[1:01:36] I put this one together with this one I
[1:01:38] brought one from South Carolina and one
[1:01:40] from
[1:01:41] I brought one from California and one
[1:01:44] from Georgia
[1:01:46] I bought one from the Philippines
[1:01:49] hmm
[1:01:51] put them back together to put you right
[1:01:52] here
[1:01:53] knowing that you'd make it
[1:01:55] no one you wouldn't fail
[1:01:57] knowing you would do everything in your
[1:01:59] power to do what this message said
[1:02:03] see how the Holy Spirit can anoint a man
[1:02:05] though
[1:02:06] but it's got to be in the order of the
[1:02:08] anointing the outside Spirit can be
[1:02:09] Anointed with the Holy Ghost and the
[1:02:10] soul is darkest pitch
[1:02:12] false teachers can rise teaching all
[1:02:14] kinds of trinitarianism and everything
[1:02:16] else and be Anointed with the Holy Ghost
[1:02:19] and perform just as many miracles as the
[1:02:22] true gospel can but by the word that's
[1:02:25] what does it can we stand that
[1:02:29] can we stand that a preacher would come
[1:02:31] in here and and say bring me all your
[1:02:34] cancers and bring me all your diabetes
[1:02:36] and all your kidney stones bring me up
[1:02:39] bring me and I'll guarantee you you'll
[1:02:41] walk out whole
[1:02:44] but William Branham was not the prophet
[1:02:46] of the end time
[1:02:49] I don't believe in that
[1:02:51] water baptism in the name of Lord Jesus
[1:02:53] Christ
[1:02:54] what are you going to do with it
[1:02:57] it's already happening
[1:02:59] but what are you going to do with it are
[1:03:01] you going to get caught up at emotion
[1:03:02] and say boy he he heals he must be right
[1:03:07] no it's the word and the word only
[1:03:11] bottom line
[1:03:14] that's my brother came I believe
[1:03:16] he straightened it out
[1:03:18] that's a true word of God
[1:03:20] get it right
[1:03:24] they'll do the same signs the anointing
[1:03:26] ones they'll do the same signs but the
[1:03:29] words what separates them keep listening
[1:03:34] somewhere they'll have to go off
[1:03:36] they all prophesied they all done this
[1:03:38] that and the other
[1:03:40] what am I getting at
[1:03:43] listen
[1:03:44] you can imitate some of these gifts
[1:03:47] some of these we call virtues you can
[1:03:51] you can self-will yourself into
[1:03:53] different things
[1:03:56] right
[1:03:57] I I've lost almost 50 pounds I self-will
[1:04:00] myself from eating potatoes and and and
[1:04:06] self-will ain't got nothing to do with
[1:04:08] God
[1:04:09] makes me feel a little bit better
[1:04:11] but I can self-will myself too back to
[1:04:14] 250 pounds
[1:04:16] from 200 so or 205 or something or
[1:04:20] they're like that but anyway
[1:04:21] but
[1:04:24] that's just my willpower
[1:04:26] this is not willpower
[1:04:29] this is not willpower
[1:04:32] now
[1:04:34] my dog my granddaughter
[1:04:36] Deanna
[1:04:38] she spent the night with us Monday night
[1:04:40] and we'll use it for an example it's a
[1:04:43] little carnal but it's an example
[1:04:45] um
[1:04:46] and and I always like math so what I
[1:04:48] would do when she was a little kid
[1:04:51] I would do math problems and I didn't
[1:04:53] just do little ones I did like 750 584
[1:04:57] times seven what's the answer
[1:05:00] you know some big and she would have
[1:05:02] well anyway so she has now she has an
[1:05:06] average in math of 105.
[1:05:09] in the 10th grade
[1:05:11] 105.
[1:05:13] it's better than me I don't know him how
[1:05:15] to get to 105.
[1:05:18] she got bonus questions
[1:05:20] but there was a teacher told me right
[1:05:21] here in Lula when she was starting up in
[1:05:24] in the school and got into like fifth or
[1:05:26] fifth or sixth grade I think they go to
[1:05:28] the seventh or eighth grade anyway it
[1:05:29] was up here at Lula and that teacher
[1:05:31] come to me and he said he said you know
[1:05:33] what Mr Dale he said he said you ought
[1:05:35] to be proud of your grandma or your
[1:05:36] granddaughter because of one thing he
[1:05:39] said now some of those people and I
[1:05:40] think about this in the spiritual sense
[1:05:42] some of these kids that I have he's math
[1:05:44] teacher he said some of these kids in my
[1:05:46] in my uh gray in my grade or my class
[1:05:52] they do it by repetition
[1:05:56] not that they know what's going on
[1:05:59] they've just done it so long they do it
[1:06:02] right by repetition he said but now your
[1:06:04] granddaughter he said I he said he said
[1:06:07] when I tell her something he said it he
[1:06:10] said it just doesn't he said it sinks
[1:06:12] down somewhere and she understands it so
[1:06:14] well
[1:06:16] why because she had good teaching before
[1:06:19] because math is really just numbers
[1:06:22] and it's zero through nine there's no
[1:06:24] other numbers but zero one two three
[1:06:26] four five six seven eight nine you all
[1:06:27] know that
[1:06:28] there's not any mystery ones oh they got
[1:06:30] A's and B's and and C's and squares and
[1:06:33] all that stuff but still it's still zero
[1:06:35] one two three four five six seven eight
[1:06:36] nine
[1:06:37] but with Deanna same way she was taught
[1:06:40] well to begin with
[1:06:42] but it wasn't that she was doing it by
[1:06:44] repetition she was understanding
[1:06:48] that if you take a quarter and a quarter
[1:06:50] you take one-fourth and one-fourth
[1:06:52] you've got a half
[1:06:54] all right
[1:06:56] then you continue on with a half and
[1:06:58] three quarters and to the hole and and
[1:07:01] you get and he said it just clicked with
[1:07:03] her he said I don't have to tell her
[1:07:04] twice he said I can do a problem tell
[1:07:07] her how to do it and he said half the
[1:07:09] class will just do it because of
[1:07:10] repetition they just do it because I did
[1:07:12] said but your daughter understands and
[1:07:14] can carry it on further well now she's
[1:07:16] in the 10th grade and it's showing same
[1:07:17] way we should do in the spiritual aspect
[1:07:21] listen we were not born to be able to be
[1:07:24] math majors
[1:07:25] but when you get born again
[1:07:29] get born again
[1:07:31] you got the teacher you know what the
[1:07:33] Bible says
[1:07:34] he puts the teacher inside of you I
[1:07:37] can't understand this
[1:07:40] I can't understand this that brother
[1:07:42] Louise he's not here tonight but he'll
[1:07:43] tell you
[1:07:44] and it is hard you go back and watch
[1:07:47] some of brother Dale's tapes back when
[1:07:49] and and and it's hard to hard to
[1:07:51] understand because he was a teacher and
[1:07:53] he broke everything down and if you
[1:07:55] tried to go in that direction he already
[1:07:57] had a roadblock up
[1:07:59] he tried to go in that direction he
[1:08:00] already had a roadblock up right am I am
[1:08:03] I correct so that taught us well so we
[1:08:07] use that teaching not a repetition well
[1:08:09] I'm coming to church because you'll come
[1:08:10] to a place though where your grades will
[1:08:13] get bad
[1:08:15] if you just do it by repetition
[1:08:18] brother Louise said I sat here for
[1:08:20] almost six months in this church and he
[1:08:22] said I didn't understand nothing your
[1:08:24] daddy was saying
[1:08:27] he said but I stuck it out
[1:08:30] he said I stuck it out and he said
[1:08:32] finally the pieces started coming
[1:08:34] together
[1:08:35] one piece at a time
[1:08:37] one Marshall at a time one piece of
[1:08:40] bread at a time one whatever you want so
[1:08:44] if you've got questions today just keep
[1:08:46] plugging along
[1:08:48] don't quit
[1:08:49] listen God never quits
[1:08:52] if you quit it's you
[1:08:54] and the devil would love for you to be a
[1:08:56] quitter
[1:08:57] but God would love for you to sit here
[1:09:00] stay under the fountain get wet long
[1:09:02] enough if you got the Holy Ghost listen
[1:09:04] he promised he'd teach you what was
[1:09:06] going on
[1:09:08] he promised almost he would
[1:09:11] as you say one day Lord you promised me
[1:09:14] my children
[1:09:16] if I are brother Bob or brother Louise
[1:09:18] or brother Aaron preach something or
[1:09:20] some other minister comes and preach and
[1:09:22] you say I just don't understand that
[1:09:23] just hang in there you just go on your
[1:09:26] prayer closet and say God you promised
[1:09:29] me
[1:09:31] that if I would make myself available
[1:09:33] you'd put somebody in the Pulpit to
[1:09:36] answer all my questions
[1:09:41] can we do that
[1:09:43] but look they'll do the same signs but
[1:09:45] the word is what separates them
[1:09:47] they all prophesied they all done this
[1:09:49] the others sure just the same Jesus said
[1:09:52] they'd do the same but the word is what
[1:09:54] separated them notice not signs
[1:09:58] everybody with me
[1:10:00] so let's look right here let's go real
[1:10:02] quick it's 8 20. let's continue on
[1:10:04] well we know what the battle of
[1:10:06] Armageddon is we are going through it
[1:10:07] right now
[1:10:09] you are going through a battle of
[1:10:10] Armageddon
[1:10:14] well if you're not pray for me and you
[1:10:16] better pray for yourself coach surprise
[1:10:18] coming
[1:10:20] now the battle started in heaven it'll
[1:10:23] be finished on Earth in the form of
[1:10:24] Armageddon but it will be on in me and
[1:10:27] you before that
[1:10:29] right
[1:10:30] now look but watch here's a promise I
[1:10:32] never have got to this but in Daniel 12
[1:10:34] there is a time of trouble
[1:10:37] called Jacob's trouble and then that's
[1:10:39] going to be and when we're gone and
[1:10:42] we're in the marriage supper it's not
[1:10:43] for the Gentiles but I think the Bible
[1:10:46] still The Book of Daniel is talking to
[1:10:49] me
[1:10:50] but
[1:10:51] God's going to stand up and fight for
[1:10:54] Israel
[1:10:55] now listen if God listen to me if God's
[1:10:58] going to stand up Michael who is Christ
[1:11:00] is going to stand up for the children of
[1:11:02] thy people which Daniel's people was
[1:11:04] what Jews right
[1:11:07] now what more is he going to stand up
[1:11:09] and fight for a son and daughter
[1:11:11] these are not Sons and Daughters of God
[1:11:16] you are a son and daughter of God he
[1:11:19] will stand and fight for you if you
[1:11:20] later but the problem is we try to fight
[1:11:22] our own battles
[1:11:24] am I getting somewhere
[1:11:26] we try to fight our own battles we try
[1:11:28] to do it our own self
[1:11:31] no there shall be a time of trouble such
[1:11:33] as never right now is your time of
[1:11:35] trouble right now is your battle right
[1:11:37] now is your Armageddon are your trials
[1:11:40] of of of uh beating it out and brother
[1:11:42] Tom falbush He blesses heart a lot of
[1:11:46] you didn't know him but it was Donnie's
[1:11:48] dad and he used to sit right there third
[1:11:51] row big Burly guy
[1:11:53] he was Mr tough
[1:11:55] but when he got in front of my dad
[1:11:58] he was Mr wimp
[1:12:00] wasn't he
[1:12:02] because he loved my dad every morning at
[1:12:04] General Motors he drove a eight ton
[1:12:06] Hollow to bring daddy a cup of coffee
[1:12:09] all the way through thinner Motors all
[1:12:11] the way through that 100 Acre through
[1:12:13] that Hundred Acre
[1:12:14] um plant here he comes
[1:12:17] what old diesel popping with that coffee
[1:12:19] in his hand to give it to brother Dale
[1:12:21] right am I telling the truth
[1:12:24] but he would tell us he'd say your daddy
[1:12:26] would tell me some things
[1:12:27] and he said I get I'd get some mad
[1:12:31] contrary to what he'd ever seen and
[1:12:33] contrary to what he was doing and Daddy
[1:12:34] was kind of you know smacking on the
[1:12:36] head he said I'd go over there and he
[1:12:38] said there's a pillar and and if you've
[1:12:40] ever been over there and somebody
[1:12:41] probably haven't but it's sectioned off
[1:12:43] there's there's concrete pillars that
[1:12:45] have like P1 well it would be P would
[1:12:47] run all the way down this way and you
[1:12:49] would understand where you're going P1
[1:12:51] P2 P3 well P1 or whatever it was was
[1:12:54] Tom's favorite one and it was like
[1:12:56] concave he said I beat my head against
[1:12:59] that thing so much
[1:13:03] because he was dying out to itself
[1:13:05] because self wanted to take over
[1:13:09] his self didn't want to die
[1:13:11] but he did finally and he sat there he
[1:13:14] said he's a bang that head against that
[1:13:15] pillar
[1:13:17] is that what we need to do
[1:13:19] it got him somewhere it got him
[1:13:21] something
[1:13:24] but if God's going to stand for Israel
[1:13:25] listen he's got to stand for me and you
[1:13:27] first
[1:13:28] all right
[1:13:30] he's got to
[1:13:32] we have had many battles spiritual
[1:13:34] battles many great v-days or Victory
[1:13:36] days that the church has had I mean the
[1:13:39] church the body of Christ I'm not
[1:13:41] talking about the organized system but
[1:13:42] I'm talking about the body of Christ the
[1:13:45] body of Believers down Through the Ages
[1:13:47] has had many great Victory days
[1:13:49] but now remember they're all in the
[1:13:51] grave
[1:13:54] waiting on me and you
[1:13:56] to have a wonderful great Victory Day
[1:13:58] the last battle
[1:14:00] our battle of Armageddon
[1:14:03] we talk about it we've had several Wars
[1:14:06] wars and rumors of wars and V days and V
[1:14:08] days and B days and it'll finally wind
[1:14:10] up in that great battle
[1:14:12] of Armageddon that'll be the last of it
[1:14:15] when she comes to the battle of
[1:14:16] Armageddon that'll settle the whole
[1:14:18] thing
[1:14:19] listen that's what's going to bring the
[1:14:21] headstone here
[1:14:23] it's when that battle of armageddon's
[1:14:24] over and the enemy has been destroyed
[1:14:27] look Armageddon is to clean off
[1:14:32] your Earth
[1:14:35] as it cleans off the Natural Earth he's
[1:14:37] going to clean off your Earth
[1:14:41] for seal
[1:14:43] she re-purified re-purifies herself with
[1:14:47] atomic blowing listen it's not just
[1:14:49] going to take a firecracker to get us
[1:14:50] out of here
[1:14:52] it's going to take the atomic bomb
[1:14:54] brother around said What Faith to get us
[1:14:57] out of here and the volcanic ash and
[1:14:59] things sink and soap blood of men that's
[1:15:02] ugly
[1:15:03] it's a battle
[1:15:05] we talk about battles
[1:15:07] I was reading a a small little snippet
[1:15:09] about a guy that survived D-Day now and
[1:15:13] those of you that don't know what D-Day
[1:15:14] is look it up I mean as soon as the men
[1:15:16] there was like several I I'm trying to
[1:15:19] say but like 30 000 men
[1:15:21] came off those boats and the Germans
[1:15:24] just slaughtered them before they even
[1:15:25] got to the to the cliff
[1:15:28] they were just picking him off and he
[1:15:29] said he said I could hear bullets flying
[1:15:31] by me he said he said they'd hit the hit
[1:15:34] my comrades he said the whole Beach was
[1:15:36] just soaked in red blood
[1:15:39] so it's a battle
[1:15:40] it's a battle it's ugly
[1:15:43] War as hell
[1:15:45] on Earth
[1:15:47] but we have a promise that look and the
[1:15:50] great millennium
[1:15:51] she sings beneath the Earth the volcanic
[1:15:53] Brays out again it renews
[1:15:56] and cleans the Earth
[1:15:59] for this great millennium
[1:16:02] he cleans his church during that time
[1:16:04] for a people to live here I like that
[1:16:07] yes sir there's coming a Time
[1:16:10] when it'll be great
[1:16:11] we talk about being born again being
[1:16:14] born again just put it plain it's your
[1:16:16] adoption because your adoption's not
[1:16:17] your birth
[1:16:19] all this we've been talking about
[1:16:21] is not the adoption part of what we're
[1:16:23] going to talk to about Sunday and we'll
[1:16:26] not stop right here want to go to the
[1:16:28] metamorphosis real quick and then we'll
[1:16:30] come back to this
[1:16:31] on Sunday everybody all right let's read
[1:16:34] this right here
[1:16:37] because there's a lot of different
[1:16:38] things now you say different yes there
[1:16:40] is different things that from your new
[1:16:42] birth
[1:16:43] to to your adoption there's a lot that
[1:16:46] goes with that
[1:16:48] all right you receive the spirit of
[1:16:50] adoption No Doubt
[1:16:54] that's how far behind I am
[1:16:57] so brother Brown tells us
[1:17:01] let's read this right here
[1:17:04] Paul tells us in Hebrews 5 10 Bob's been
[1:17:08] through this before
[1:17:10] talking about called of God and high
[1:17:11] priests after the order of Melchizedek
[1:17:13] I'm whom we have many things to say and
[1:17:16] hard to be uttered seeing your dull of
[1:17:17] hearing boy that's kind of hard for
[1:17:19] somebody to take for when that for the
[1:17:21] time you ought to be teachers you have
[1:17:24] need that one teach you again which be
[1:17:27] the first principles of the Oracles of
[1:17:30] God he's admonishing the people that
[1:17:33] they are not where they think they are
[1:17:35] and our become such as have need of milk
[1:17:38] and not of strong meat for everyone that
[1:17:42] uses melt look is unskillful
[1:17:48] this is not unskillful
[1:17:51] this is using as they say in the
[1:17:54] business World your skill set
[1:17:57] whatever your skill set is you use it
[1:18:00] every day
[1:18:02] I know how to do Mail Packages all the
[1:18:04] blah blah blah I couldn't go do Bob's
[1:18:07] job
[1:18:07] I couldn't get in the building
[1:18:11] they say Lord hillbilly how'd he get in
[1:18:14] this thing I said I know Bob
[1:18:17] and throw me and Bob both out
[1:18:21] because my skill set is not that I might
[1:18:24] tell them I'm delivering the mail
[1:18:26] for everyone that uses milk is
[1:18:28] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[1:18:29] for he is a babe now remember he didn't
[1:18:32] say he's lost
[1:18:34] didn't say he was just gone and you know
[1:18:37] let's just kick that person out no he's
[1:18:40] a baby and the body he's a son and
[1:18:43] daughter of God a baby
[1:18:45] but strong meat belongs to them that are
[1:18:47] what are a full age even those who by
[1:18:49] reason of use
[1:18:53] by reason of you using do you know what
[1:18:57] exercise I know y'all hate it but your
[1:19:01] body is made to exercise
[1:19:04] your body is not made to sit around
[1:19:05] drink diet I'm not even Diet Coke drink
[1:19:07] Coke

[1:19:10] those you don't know what tether chips
[1:19:12] are they're potato chips
[1:19:17] that's how you get 250 pounds
[1:19:20] but strong meat belongs to them that are
[1:19:23] a full age even those who by reason of
[1:19:25] use
[1:19:26] have their senses hmm
[1:19:29] memory reason conscious affection
[1:19:31] imagination remember there's only one
[1:19:33] sense in the in the middle guy Faith or
[1:19:35] doubt you're either born again or not
[1:19:37] George's not talking about it says
[1:19:38] census
[1:19:39] you're out in the second room you're out
[1:19:41] in the spirit realm your senses
[1:19:44] exercised to discern
[1:19:47] the good from the evil
[1:19:49] can you do that
[1:19:52] you better be able to this is the time
[1:19:54] this is the time of the separating time
[1:19:56] because remember the battle of
[1:19:57] Armageddon oh let me go back to that
[1:19:59] listen battle of Armageddon is not
[1:20:01] against two people that like each other
[1:20:06] there's never been a battle
[1:20:08] against two people that loved each other
[1:20:12] not a war like that no that wanted to
[1:20:16] kill you
[1:20:17] for a belief and you're wanting to kill
[1:20:19] them for a belief and keep from getting
[1:20:20] killed all right
[1:20:23] Church age during the church ages the
[1:20:25] bride tree was eat to a stump we know
[1:20:27] brother Brown tells us that
[1:20:29] but watch what these four stages of
[1:20:31] rebirth being born again so let's go
[1:20:33] through it this is where the butterfly
[1:20:35] this is where the metamorphosis comes in
[1:20:37] and man you're talking about keep
[1:20:39] reading just keep reading about this so
[1:20:41] there's four stages so the four stages
[1:20:43] of your to get you to adoption
[1:20:47] get by with me to get you to adoption it
[1:20:50] takes four stages not three
[1:20:54] all right takes four
[1:20:56] because there's four bugs eat it down
[1:20:59] Palm one canker worm caterpillar Locus
[1:21:03] that eat and brother Brown tells us
[1:21:06] every one of them is Joy the fellowship
[1:21:08] the word the this the lat all that we're
[1:21:10] not going to get to it let's just get to
[1:21:12] what this butterfly is now remember
[1:21:14] there's four stages of rebirth there is
[1:21:17] an egg laid
[1:21:19] by the one
[1:21:21] that you're going to look like
[1:21:26] it's laid by the adult
[1:21:29] in other words you're not gonna get born
[1:21:31] again under baby teaching
[1:21:33] hmm but what is justification
[1:21:37] chopped off what you were before
[1:21:41] come on
[1:21:43] and those he's Justified he's already
[1:21:45] glorified so if you're a real true egg
[1:21:46] now listen if you're a real true egg
[1:21:49] you'll become a butterfly
[1:21:53] all right caterpillar is the next stage
[1:21:57] it's the feeding stage
[1:22:00] this thing to burst out turns into a
[1:22:02] caterpillar
[1:22:06] and what do you do when you become
[1:22:07] sanctified
[1:22:09] you come to church you start eating the
[1:22:11] word of God
[1:22:12] you start kicking out all the bad stuff
[1:22:14] everybody with me
[1:22:17] caterpillar is the feeding stage
[1:22:19] it's the stage that tells it it tells in
[1:22:22] the uh
[1:22:24] um encyclopedia or whatever you know
[1:22:25] Google
[1:22:27] that a caterpillar will eat five times
[1:22:31] its weight
[1:22:34] but there's a butterfly inside there
[1:22:37] and that butterfly
[1:22:38] is longing to get out
[1:22:41] so the more he eats the bigger he gets
[1:22:46] and it might not look so pretty
[1:22:47] sanctification is not really pretty
[1:22:50] because it's a tearing it's a ripping
[1:22:52] it's a pull and remember it's blood
[1:22:55] sanctification is the blood all right so
[1:22:59] the pupa stage is the transition stage
[1:23:04] or the New Birth
[1:23:07] your cells grow rapidly then
[1:23:10] you've got a new life there's something
[1:23:12] inside of you wanting to get out it's a
[1:23:14] transition stage that's you still kind
[1:23:17] of look a little like the caterpillar
[1:23:20] but you don't look like a butterfly but
[1:23:22] you look more like toward the butterfly
[1:23:24] than you do the caterpillar you look
[1:23:26] more like God
[1:23:27] that's a new birth than you did at
[1:23:29] sanctification
[1:23:31] all right now when you come to the adult
[1:23:32] it's the reproductive stage about how to
[1:23:36] fit
[1:23:37] you mature by the word what are you
[1:23:39] doing you're coming back to what that
[1:23:41] was that planted you
[1:23:44] born in His image
[1:23:47] not we're not looking like it
[1:23:50] you may not look like it till you get to
[1:23:52] the very end stage
[1:23:55] but you still have four stages full
[1:23:58] restoration what did it do it brought
[1:24:00] you back to what puts you in the ground
[1:24:02] or what planted the egg
[1:24:05] the stage where you look like your birth
[1:24:07] parents
[1:24:09] praise God
[1:24:12] each stage is different and serves a
[1:24:16] purpose at each stage
[1:24:19] that's why we believe in true
[1:24:20] justification chopped off your past sins
[1:24:23] true sanctification unclean Spirit goes
[1:24:26] out you start living better living right
[1:24:27] that's not your new birth
[1:24:31] right the pupil stage is
[1:24:35] a transition stage
[1:24:37] cells start growing you actually start
[1:24:39] changing into another image praise the
[1:24:42] Lord you start changing into another
[1:24:44] image because you're getting ready to
[1:24:46] look like a butterfly
[1:24:48] and then when you get to the maturity of
[1:24:51] the adoption stage you're looking like
[1:24:53] the father
[1:24:55] and the mother that brought you here
[1:24:57] so each stage is different it serves the
[1:25:00] purpose of each stage each one of these
[1:25:02] are a stage
[1:25:04] that we come to are a metamorphosis
[1:25:08] it's the process of transformation
[1:25:11] from an immature form
[1:25:14] to an adult form and two or more
[1:25:16] distinct stages well it's four we know
[1:25:18] that there's different ones for
[1:25:20] different bugs a change of the form or
[1:25:22] nature of a thing or person into a
[1:25:24] completely different one by natural or
[1:25:27] Supernatural means
[1:25:29] the Journey Begins With a call to
[1:25:31] Adventure away from the Ordinary World
[1:25:32] one is familiar with and comfortable in
[1:25:36] you know there's many times there's many
[1:25:38] bugs I was reading on that a little bit
[1:25:40] I'll try to want to stay with the
[1:25:41] butterfly but there are different ones
[1:25:43] that they lay an egg and it's not until
[1:25:44] another year before that thing starts
[1:25:48] growing or getting to a caterpillar
[1:25:50] there's different ones but you and I we
[1:25:52] come to this stage to wear an egg then
[1:25:54] we come to Caterpillar then we come to
[1:25:56] the pupa and then we come to the adult
[1:25:58] stage just like this right here
[1:26:00] initially one may deny this call because
[1:26:03] of its Dawning pull toward a potential
[1:26:04] dangerous unknown a caterpillar when
[1:26:06] he's eaten listen when the caterpillar
[1:26:08] is eating he's not going I'm gonna be a
[1:26:10] butterfly
[1:26:12] I'm gonna be a bird
[1:26:14] no the butterflies inside there
[1:26:17] he's eating because he's jumped down his
[1:26:19] side
[1:26:21] he said just keep eating
[1:26:23] you may not look like it but just keep
[1:26:25] on eating
[1:26:26] there's something inside there I want to
[1:26:28] get out but you gotta eat for it to get
[1:26:30] out
[1:26:32] if answered and acted upon one enters in
[1:26:34] a special world
[1:26:36] where one undergoes a series of tests
[1:26:38] and challenges the road of Trials
[1:26:41] encounters enemies
[1:26:43] and also mentors and allies that guide
[1:26:45] and assist through the difficulties
[1:26:48] through the fires of tribulation and
[1:26:50] Chaos a part of the initiate dies and
[1:26:53] it's reborn wow because remember the
[1:26:56] caterpillar all that breaks apart
[1:26:58] all that breaks away I think the the
[1:27:02] article I was reading uh caterpillar
[1:27:05] actually this that's why they grow so
[1:27:07] big they grow so big they crack
[1:27:11] if you don't eat enough you don't crack
[1:27:12] so they die and there's a butterfly
[1:27:13] inside there nothing comes out but if
[1:27:15] you eat enough and swell up enough
[1:27:18] you'll crack
[1:27:20] and what comes out what's inside of you
[1:27:23] to the fires of tribulation and Chaos
[1:27:25] are part of the initiate dies and is
[1:27:27] reborn
[1:27:28] resurrected within a lecture that is
[1:27:30] taken back to be shared with the
[1:27:33] Ordinary World what
[1:27:36] we watch butterflies right they're just
[1:27:38] beautiful we plant butterfly plants
[1:27:40] butterfly bushes sorry butterfly bushes
[1:27:44] we do or we did you got butterfly bushes
[1:27:46] why to see the caterpillar
[1:27:48] see the egg
[1:27:50] to see that ugly Pupa hanging down on
[1:27:52] kiss right here underneath the leaf
[1:27:55] no but if you don't
[1:27:58] see those you'll never see the butterfly
[1:28:01] so we plant butterfly bushes to see the
[1:28:03] butterfly not see the caterpillar not
[1:28:06] see all these other stages we discover
[1:28:07] there's more to give and have the
[1:28:09] capacity now to bestow these inner
[1:28:12] qualities unto others this edification
[1:28:15] of self deepens us into a more Mythic
[1:28:18] way of being in the world a higher plane
[1:28:20] of existing there's your adoption
[1:28:22] because nobody not everybody's going to
[1:28:24] come to adoption
[1:28:25] a higher point of existing unless
[1:28:27] musicians come let's stand our feet then
[1:28:30] where then when we started from from
[1:28:32] which we can give more of ourself
[1:28:36] listen
[1:28:38] the egg sticks to a leaf it don't move
[1:28:42] okay everybody with me
[1:28:44] the caterpillar only can crawl so far
[1:28:51] when that Pupa comes it stops
[1:28:54] it starts working on the inside
[1:28:58] but what moves what gives more of our
[1:29:00] self is when we reproduce
[1:29:03] what was planted inside of us same way
[1:29:06] with corn same way with anything
[1:29:08] and this is what we're coming to and
[1:29:10] we'll get to it maybe Sunday Matthew 21
[1:29:12] Jesus said unto them do you did you
[1:29:14] never read in the scripture the stone
[1:29:16] which the builders rejected
[1:29:20] the same has become the head of the
[1:29:22] corner this is the Lord's doing and it's
[1:29:25] marvelous
[1:29:26] in our eyes therefore I say unto you the
[1:29:28] kingdom of God shall be taken from you
[1:29:31] and given to a nation bringing forth the
[1:29:34] fruits there of another he's telling
[1:29:35] Israel that he's coming out from you and
[1:29:38] going to be given to a gentile Nation
[1:29:41] and that's us
[1:29:43] and whosoever shall fall on this Stone
[1:29:45] shall be broken we'll talk about this
[1:29:47] Sunday but on whomsoever it shall fall
[1:29:49] it will grind him to powder it will
[1:29:53] change him
[1:29:54] to a different image

[1:30:45] burning inside of me there's something I
