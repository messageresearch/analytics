secrets to see if we can just get ourselves out of the way and look through his eyes we can see him this evening it's a privilege and honor to be with you again this evening we had such a wonderful time of fellowship with the young people last night and I just think brother salmon brother wait for the opportunity to come and stand behind the pulpit here and and then speak to young and old alike and just hope that something could be said this evening that'll be a blessing if you have your Bibles return with me to the book of Philippians chapter 3 again I bring greetings from my dad my pastor brother Joe Greene there in Ruth North Carolina and we just again thankful for the opportunity to be here and we love each and every one of you like family we've pretty much grew up around here with brother Wade and brother Sam and the church here so we're all we're all big part of God's family this evening we'll begin reading at verse 13 that says brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before verse 14 says I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Jesus Christ let's bow our heads dear kind of gracious Heavenly Father as we stand behind the sacred desk this evening Lord we just ask that you come down and move me out of the way Lord and speak through my lips I'm just a microphone this evening father my god I ask you use me just one more time this evening to speak to this portion of your bride god we we've read the scripture Lord and if that's all we read and said Amen we'd have a jubilee time this evening but father as we delve into these things that you've laid upon our heart God I ask that just something be said that will be a blessing to this portion of your bride father and God as we at the end of the service as we stack arms and stack our Bibles order and go our separate ways God may it be like the disciples on the road to emmaus Lord let something be said that will burn within our hearts Lord we thank you for it Lord in Jesus name we pray amen even have your seats she'll bear with me I want to read that again from the amplified version for beginning at verse 13 that says I do not consider brethren that I have captured and made it my own yet but one thing I do it is my one aspiration forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead verse 14 I press on towards the goal to win the supreme and heavenly prize to which God in Christ Jesus is calling us upward that is my goal in life that is my one aspiration as it says is to find him to make it home this evening he's calling us he's calling us home his brother Sam said this morning he's calling us home it's not going to be long I was listening to that that sermon last night after we had the Bible study I was listening to a northern ones at the end time at the beginning of the service brother Branham says and this is in what 1965 I believe he says I'm thankful for this service because it could be the very last one but I feel it's coming too soon and if that was 60 years ago how much more closer home aren't we this evening for the next little bit I would like to speak on a little thought called getting better at forgetting or pressing on if I would put a subtitle to it we want to look at how we need to forget our past and press towards the future we don't need to dwell on the things of the past that have bound us for so long and if kept us held back for so long but we need to let go of those things and press on towards the high calling oftentimes after we've had a big move of God in our life a healing or a deliverance or he's done something for us then that's when Satan comes and sets on your shoulder and says did you did that really happen is was that for you or you sure was that supposed to be for you or was this for your neighbor he tries to talk you out of a brother dick but he can't talk you out of that healing you're looking for this evening he can't talk you out of that deliverance that he's promised you this book here is full of promises and he can't take him back once he's promised you he's promised us everything we have need of right here in these pages but we have to make it real in our hearts we have to have that measure of faith that he's given us like I said last night he's took the guesswork out of it for us he's done all the legwork all we have to do is believe and all things are possible to them that believe and the message blind bartimaeus brother Branham says no matter how sick you are how bad you are how many trials you've had when he said whosoever will let him come he meant you that's right how am I going to get it brother Branham the doctor said I can't I can't get well throw it aside let it go we've got his attention tonight he's passing this way he's been here every night this week he's here now and he'll be anywhere where two or three are gathered in his name I'll be there in their midst whatever they agree upon and ask they shall receive it we've got his attention now he's moving through the building how many came with him this evening all right there's more than two or three that have agreed so he's here if nobody else but me and brother Sam agreed he'd still be here so he's moving through the building now just to meet your needs he's moving through each row each seat looking for what need that you have he's here with open arms and open ears to listen and hear what you have need of tonight and that don't fall on deaf ears maybe it won't happen tonight maybe it won't happen tomorrow maybe that's next week or next year but if you're praying and believing and sincere he's bound to listen he's bound to make it possible because his word says so ask any one thing in my name that's what the scripture says write the word past means ago just gone or he lapsed having existed or taken place in a period before the present bygone we've all heard the saying let bygones be bygones let it go this evening this is real simple but I'm not preaching anything new I'm just stirring up your minds in the way of remembrance tonight I'm not preaching any new gospel I'm not preaching anything that bro Sam brother waitering these other brothers would preach to you just a simple encouragement this evening the word future means the condition or situation of someone or something in the time that will come my dad preaches a message says that your condition is not your conclusion whatever battle you're in right now or whatever battle you're coming out of or whatever battle you're fixing to face it's not your conclusion if you're a true born child of God your conclusion is that you will overcome because we were made victorious overcomers in his sight not our own sight because if we look at our own selves we can't do nothing we can't do anything we can't cure a headache we can't get ourselves out of a financial bond whatever it may be buying excuse me but if we look to him and look through his eyes like I said earlier all things are possible oftentimes we find ourselves listening to Satan's whisper and before I get ahead of myself I'm just gonna put this right here and see who has faith it's a $5 bill young and older like who has faith I like it I like it I like it but then as soon as as soon as he takes that blessing see that he had more faith than all the rest of you to come and get that he had faith to stand up out of his seat and come get that but as soon as he comes and gets that here comes Satan right now now you know he's got a three-hour drive back home he may need that five dollar bill for gas he might need that to get a cheeseburger on the way home cuz he's got a pregnant wife and she's hungry she's gonna kill me for that but it's okay but you see he's not he's not giving up he's not giving me that $5 back and that's the way we need to be now this is this may be silly now but you'll remember it that's the way we need to be we don't we don't need to say well I guess you're right he may need that just don't agree with the devil take your blessing take your blessing and run with it stick it in your pocket like he did he'd never seen I've never seen anybody move that fast for him a lot stuck a thing in his pocket real quick cuz you knew I was gonna try to take it back from him but see he had the faith just come up here and get that that's all it's all it takes is that little bit of faith to come and get what you have need up from God now that's just $5 what about eternal life what about your healing what about your salvation what about the salvation that you're seeking for one of your family members it's it's the same thing it's that easy that easy amen why don't we listen to that voice of reason but the SAMS talking about that reason this morning once we start reasoning with ourselves and with Satan oftentimes we find ourselves back at square one we've lost what we got because we start to reason and we start to doubt and we starting to disbelieve everything that has been given to us just like the miracle of my wife being pregnant what if I said well I said now I'm telling you the devil started fighting me as soon as I soon as we found out I would jump on my shoulder and say well what if something's wrong what if he has the same birth defects that you had what if he has the problems with his kidneys like you had when when you were born and this and that and I'd look at him and I say I was a I was a miracle baby I said God called me God prophesied to my grandpa that I would be here God told my wife and myself through brother Ron Spencer that we would have a child you can't take that away from me ain't no ain't no devil in Hell can take that away from me you can't take the experiences that I've had away from me brother John they can't take the experience you had away from you no matter how many naysayers area no matter how many doubters there are it didn't happen to you a little song says I was there when it happened so I guess I ought to know I was there when he came down on that Friday night in 2015 and filled me with the Holy Ghost and turned my life around nobody but the whole building was full of people but that night was for me that night was for me and nobody else can take that away from me nobody else can even try you can fight me to the death and I'll tell you that that that is what happened because it happened to me it was my experience don't look back where you came from look to where you're going don't look back at the life of seeing you two are in don't look back at the times when you were down and out and thought nobody loved you and as brother Jewell says has a case of the wowsie wowsie Woo's don't look back at those things but look forward to where we're going I don't believe it's much longer friends till we'll be in the presence of Jehovah to will be fellowship and with brother Brennaman and the different ones that have going on it won't be long till I'll be sitting there talking with my grandpa telling them thank you for looking over that banister and telling me to keep running to keep keep going keep keeping the faith thank you for you may not you may not been on earth with me but thank you for that encouragement that every time I look at his picture when I walk into the church there at home I can say he's there looking at me over the banister of heaven and telling me to press on both my grandpa's actually telling me to press on brother Dan nasally all the rest of them that have gone on there they're telling each one of us received in young people press on press on it won't be very long we look at Lot's wife and the consequences that she had for looking back Genesis 19 in verse 26 says but his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt that was the one thing that they said not to do don't look back but she was too heady and high-minded and her social gatherings and her fashion of the day and things like that that she didn't want to leave that behind she wanted to turn around and look back behind her and that's oftentimes how we get we start to look back at the things we came from because well we had fun back then but we thought we were having fun back then yeah I thought I was having fun when I go out drinking on Friday and Saturday night I thought I'd had fun when I sit around my buddies and smoke a cigarette and coughed my lungs up and then try to go to church on Sunday morning and act like I was a Christian just because who my daddy was this because of who my grandpa was but that's not the case you don't have fun until you have Jesus in your life and then you start having the best of the most fun I've met the most people in my life set set in the past three or four years I've met more people and got more friendships than all the drinking buddies non-smoking buddies and all that running around and carousing buddies that I used to have in high school why because we share that same that same for lack of a better word the same and I lost that word too but you know what I'm talking about this evening this is that same goal that same mindset there we go and they would come to me in a minute I'm a little tired this evening but we share that same focus because we're all trying to make heaven our home we're not trying to get that next higher that next buzz we're all focusing on getting home and the message Jehovah Jireh number three prophet of God tells us and notice another while we're on at lot jesus said himself remember Lot's wife if the word isn't so important if the reasoning is all right when that angel said to a lot in his family go to Zohar but don't look back and Lot's wife on a little insignificant thing as to turn around and look back but it was contrary to the word she turned to a pillar of salt and that's the thing that we have to realize that these things that we're doing looking back it's contrary to what he tells us we read here at the beginning Paul's talking to the Phillips bethe excuse me the Philippians I'm having all kinds of trouble tonight lord help me he pressed toward the heart of the mark he didn't look behind him he forgot the things but he remembered what his goal was he remembered where he was headed he didn't let those things that were behind him hold him down the other scripture says and I think it's in here but will will quote it now I lay aside the things of the world that does so easily beset me and not just set them down so that way when things get tough I can go pick them up again lay aside means to put out cast away and don't don't don't go back to those things anymore cast them away from you where they're not in your reach anymore because I can tell you right now these these worldly girls and these just drinking and stuff that goes on it don't get you anywhere you can't run back to the girl that said she'll be there for you anytime any day because she's already moved on to the next one and the drinking buddies have all went on I found a new drinking buddy since you've been gone you can't look back to those things you can't count on those things but there is one true friend that you can always count on this evening and that's Jesus Christ they talked about it this morning I think your baby was last night in the name of Jesus what other name should mean might be saved but in the name of Jesus everything that you have need of all you have to do is call on his name everything that you have need of you can call it mama you can call it daddy but they can only help you so far your heavenly Father so you need to be reaching out to it so you need to call on in your time of desperation like I said last night I gave my testimony I got to that point of desperation where I knew daddy couldn't help me where I knew mama couldn't help me where I even knew that my fiancee at the time couldn't help me I could only call on Jesus to help me because without him I wouldn't be standing here this evening no doubt without him any of you wouldn't be sitting where you're sitting this evening if you keep looking back to your problems eventually you won't be able to look forward you've let your past affect your future everything you've done in the past is in the past for a reason like I said last night when my wife and I were praying for a child brother Ron pulled us aside and spoke gave us a word from the Lord his prayer said the past is the past for a reason don't let it affect your future than so many words and that was exactly what was happening with us we were letting our past affect our future but thing got on that night we let go of the past brother Donny and now she's too much pregnant with that miracle child and we thank God for that I know you've heard it a million times already this weekend but I'm excited about that so I'm going to tell you again stop holding on to the things of the past that Satan uses to keep you bound don't let it affect your future press forward God has forgiven you and forgotten it why can't we do the same oftentimes we've all heard the saying forgive and forget but as humans sometimes we forgive but we can't forget it we won't let it go we don't want to we want to hold that grudge or we want to hold that that play center in our hearts for a brother or a sister that's maybe said something wrong or said something kind of out of the way that rubbed us the wrong way they didn't even mean to but bless God I'm not gonna talk to them at church anymore I'm not gonna sit beside them in the fellowship hall anymore I'll forgive them but I won't forget what they did to me that's that's not that's not good Church that's not that's not the way it needs to be if God who we're supposed to be like we're supposed to be cried with Christians we're christ-like if we're supposed to be christ-like both Sam how can we forgive and not forget he forgave us of all of our sins not just backstabbing a neighbor or bad-mouthing a neighbor he forgave us of all our sins he put them deep down in the sea of forgetfulness and put up a sign that says no fishing but here comes old devil if I was in his fishing rod brother Terrence and he starts to reel in one of your sins but you know his lining strong enough it's his ain't got no mana Carmen and her fluorocarbon on his line he just got some cheapo five weight from Walmart so to speak he gets it just about time where he's fixing to bring it up in your face again and that line snaps and there it goes back down where it came from never to be remembered again he tries his best to throw it up in our face this evening but he can't do it why because the blood because the blood of the lamb we overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony so I want each and every one of you this evening whatever you have need of testify even you know it's we've already it's already been bought and paid for on Calvary my stripes you were healed you wear bracelets I got one now it says by His stripes I'm healed I shall not die but live and declare the works of the Lord remember that that's that's pretty much the same thing I just said by the blood of the Lamb and the word of your testimony so whatever you have need of tonight testify that it's already done sing a song at home I don't know if y'all sing it here God it's already done it's already done hallelujah it's already done amen in the beginning and ending of the great Gentile dispensation brother Branham says now a man that's really got his face set toward heaven no matter what takes place here on earth he still got his face set towards heaven his friends may forsake him his family may forsake him his pastor may forsake him but there is one that won't forsake him that's God and when your mind is made up I like that Daniel had burnt bridges all the bridges behind him and he wasn't planning on going back anymore he wasn't watching his back trail he was looking for seeking those things which are in the past he pressed on towards a mark of the high calling that's what we should be doing that's what the church should be doing that's what spoken-word church should be doing this that's what the bride should be doing this evening I like to make it personal though wherever I'm at that's what spoken word church should be doing this evening it's pressing forward and not looking back at where we came from because if we look back to where we came from we're reminded of what dirty rotten scoundrels we are but if we look forward and look through the blood like he does then we're white as snow there's nothing that can be held against us you go to court for a speeding ticket or something and they've got proof that brother Terence was speeding don't mean to call you how to hope you don't speed but but he's got he's got a written ticket that the officer gave him and the judge has a copy of it he has proof but when we go to court as Christians the whole court system is stacked in our favor he's the jury he's the judge he's our lawyer you know the song when mercy stepped in and pleaded my case there's there's no fault against me now you may know deep down that there's stuff that you've done that you're not proud of but it don't matter what you think they don't matter what the past was when the judge looks at your case they bangs a gavel down and he says pardoned my goodness I don't make a Baptist shout to say if you go to reason and it's saying things like I don't know if I'm ready to let it go or I'll let it go one day it'll never happen I think brother Sam hit on it this morning about well I gotta wait until I stop smoking her I got to wait till I stop drinking before I can become a Christian no I still smoke all I want to I still drink all I want to I still run around on my wife all I want to i still gamble all I want to I see these young people looking at me like are you serious but I think God he took that want to out of money when I gave my life over to him again on that night of August of 2015 all those won't to his left me the only want to I want to do is serve Him in the restoration of the bride tree in 1962 if the officer was going to going to take the fellow that stole your property and was going to take him to court and you keep pulling him back well I don't know just whether he should do this or not he'll never get him there just let him go if you keep reasoning with the devil or keep saying well I can't do this till I quit smoking I can't do this till I quit doing this or doing that ain't never gonna happen you might as well just hang it up but if you come to him he'll take that all that uncleanness out of you and clean you up just like he used the illustration this morning I'll use it a little different way there's a there the Kaufman the Kaufman family sings a song about a little cup I found out in the barnyard or in the in the dirt somewhere and they take it then they he brings it in the house and he cleans it up and he puts it on the Shelf for service but if it we're just sitting there on the shelf we're not doing any good but once we get took off that shelf and he feels us and puts us in the service it's like each one of you young people each one of you old people there's a part to play in this church for each and every one of you you've got a pasture and you've got associates you've got other preachers deacons Sunday School teachers but we've got to have somebody to preach to you may think well I if you say Amen I'll praise the Lord that's what you need to do this what you're called to do because without people to preach to we will be preaching the empty pews and that ain't no fun because we like a little response every once in a while second Corinthians three and verse 18 says but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord we look at ourselves through the mirror of his word we don't look like that old man from the past when I look at myself in the mirror when I'm shaving or getting ready for work in the morning I always say well my goodness what a sister Caitlin seeing me I'm uglier no junkyard dog but then again I looking at and I begin to think and I begin to ponder she didn't marry me for my looks nobody would but she married me for what was on the inside of me looks fade we get we get fat well I was already fat hope I don't get no fatter but we get we get out of shape and we get older and we get things that are these things happen to our bodies and over time but that inside man is we've talked about this morning that inside man is where the character really is that is that is what you young people that's what you need to look for you get your character right first most of all but that's what you look for in a spouse in a you know a loved one is that character that is christ-like that character that is none other than Jesus Christ because what are we we are mrs. Jesus Christ we are heirs with the Father we were part of him and we don't want to be unequally yoked or to be this or that I've tried taking worldly girls it's no fun trust me and we were taught they were talking about it last night and I used to date actually before I met my wife I dated a Baptist pastor's daughter that was fun on Sunday mornings because I wasn't where I needed to be so I'd say yeah we'll go to your church for you go to mine and then the next Sunday it was like want to go to my church can we go to my church so we go to her church about every other Sunday morning and I wasn't even living right and it freaked me out to be in there I didn't I didn't like the way they did things I know I said this ain't right something deep down inside of me even though I wasn't where I needed to be there was something on the inside a deep looking for a deep - responded in the Baptist Church ain't it none of these denominational churches is it I found it I finally got it to respond after searching for it and you say well you said you were out drinking and stuff but I don't mean it was right that don't mean I didn't feel something on the inside telling me not to do it but I did it anyway because I wanted to be like my friends I wanted to be like my buddies that I hung out with all the time yeah we'll go down to Buffalo Wild Wings and get some hot wings and of course like that was my thing but I think God that I'm sitting in a different table this evening and I'm not I'm not drinking the Coors Light I still eat hot wings but I'm not drinking the Coors Light I'm drinking the water of his word this evening don't dwell on what you used to look like I got off on a tangent there but we're still looking in the mirror don't look at what you used to look like I used to smoke I used to drink I used to do this I used to do that I used to party the past is the past now when you look in the mirror of his word you don't see Nate green you don't see Wade Dale or Lewis you a go you see Jesus Christ you see what you longed to be for so long now you know when when you're young and you want to be like John Wayne or you want to be like LeBron James or well I don't even keep up with it anymore much they shown Watson or anybody like that I don't want to be like Jesus when I was younger I always wanted to be a wrestler I wanted to be big and strong like I got the big part but not the strong part like a like a wrestler or a football player or something like that but now when I look in the mirror I look like my daddy everybody tells me I look like my daddy you could see a bigger version of Joe Green standing up here this evening I used to I used to let that bother me a little bit I don't like him I love him but I don't want nothing to do with him he's you know I want to go do my own thing I don't want to be like daddy but the older I get the more I look at like he says he looks at his hands and sees his daddy's hands I look at my hands and see my daddy's hands I look in the mirror and I see my daddy I am my father's son we are our father's children this evening and we were talking about in the in the Bible study about how to live a lie I think it was in the end though the youth thing there that last question about living a life in front of people being a testimony not just given your testimony but living your testimony you want these these these others to come in these these girls that maybe you're interested in or boys whether it may be and this is going completely different than what I thought it would but here we are this evening you you got to be like I think brother Sam said it this morning you got to be salty you can't like I did and go to church with your girlfriend on Sunday morning just to please her you're not trying to please her you got to please God you're not trying to please a girl just so you can take her out to Ruby Tuesday's on Friday night bring her to church bring her to and then you that's when you really get to test she absolutely hated coming to my church she absolutely despises she would do anything she could to get out of it and I realized real quick even though like I said I wasn't where I was supposed to be that she needs to go and probably about two weeks after that's when I started talking to sister Kaitlyn back there and that was almost nine years ago so God does all things and he does all things well imagine driving down the road going forward but looking in your rear-view mirror the whole time what would that get you that would get you in a world of hurt you would as one of my buddies used to say you'd end up you wake up dead because if you're looking back while you're moving forward you ain't getting nowhere the only way you're getting the six feet under real quick and that's the same way and your spiritual walk if you're trying to move forward with Christ and you're looking back at what you used to do you ain't going nowhere you're just pretty much treading water because you ain't going nowhere looking back to the past will cause a wreck in the future looking back on what things used to be no matter how much better you think they were or how much nicer they were because I had friends when I was drinking and smoking and doing these things and when I accepted the Lord and he come into my heart I don't have those friends anymore they all left me - one guy my very best friend and I believe God gives him to me just so I can be a witness to him and and have that that camaraderie he's one of my very best friends a local police officer back home been been my buddy since high school and we were actually was in his wedding two years ago and we went to a fishing down in Columbia South Carolina and his brother is a big time drinker this guy drinks on occasion but his brother he collects hard liquor and stuff like that he's got a very large collection anyways so he's all about the the spirits the wrong spirits so we were went and chartered a boat and went fishing and the night before they started drinking and carrying on and my buddy he stayed to the side and wouldn't drink as long as I was in the room because he respected what I stand for he wouldn't do any of that that stuff that all the other boys were doing so I think it was about 10 o'clock or so I said fellas I'm going to bed I'm gonna go you know read my Bible I actually had to preach that Sunday so I'm gonna go meditate a little bit and his brother made fun of me he said won't you pray for me while you're in there and I said I will I said I absolutely will and then being my buddy he kind of took up for me a little bit I said just leave him alone let him do his thing so I say all that to say this if you have those friends and you live that life before them they have no choice but to respect you because they see something different in you they see that you're trying to do a lot of live a life right they see that you're trying not to fit in but you're trying to stand now and even to this day when we go out somewhere we'll go out to dinner we'll take our wives out to dinners a place at home we always like to go he'll never say one word to me he'll never buy alcohol his wife me but that's a different story but he'll never buy alcohol he'll never drink he may say a few words around me but that's that's about it he respects me enough to know what I stand for he's got another friend that was with us that is a deacon of a local Baptist Church and he was the drunkest one out all over so you see somebody who has that revelation as we talked about this morning and somebody who thinks they have that revelation it's it's different ballgame it's it's a whole different whole different atmosphere once you know somebody who's genuine and somebody who's playing church and we're at a time Saints we're at a time young people we're playing Church won't get us anywhere we're at a time where we need to be sincere genuine and not let anything come between us and our heavenly home this evening let me go on Psalms 23 and 6 says surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever I don't want my past following me these two things right here what I won't following me when I look back I'm not looking back at my past I'm looking back to make sure goodness and mercy still there you go with me are y'all with me I want y'all to stay with me everywhere I go surely goodness and mercy shall follow me not half the time not a quarter of the time not only when I think I'm doing good but all the days of my life that word all means all-inclusive without exception everyone and the message Salome 1964 prophet of God tells us now today as we face in new years I want to think of it not like the past but I want to look to the future see as Paul said forgetting those things that are in the past I press toward the mark see of the high calling and as as it is expressed like looking through the mirror of looking back through the mirror of a car we're looking at what we have passed now we're looking into the rearview mirror now we're not trying to place a message today as looking through a rear-view mirror it would take too long see the things that the Lord has did and you're all acquainted with the great things that our Lord has been doing and some of the might it is some of the mightiest things that I have ever seen in my life he's just passing in this last few months and but now we are thankful for what it has been but now we're looking forward we're looking where we are headed and into this 1964 let's put that into today we just come into a new year we're looking forward we're looking into 2020 we're not looking at what should have been or what could have been in 2019 but we're looking at is what is going to be in 2020 you say well I'll let another year get by and didn't get right with the Lord well this year this day is your day today is the day of salvation don't let another day don't let another minute don't let another second get by without getting him in your heart and in your life because without him we're just cannon fodder without him where are we brother there's no place I would rather be than in him there's no place I I've slept in nicest beds and all over the United States and some places around the world been in some of the nicest hospitals but there's no place I'd rather be than in the arms of Jesus with if I'm in the arms of Jesus ain't got to worry about a hospital bed ain't got to worry about finding somewhere to sleep or finding somewhere to be if I'm all by myself if I have him I'll never be alone if he is in you Christ in you the hope of glory that's what we have to realize this evening he's Christ in us the hope of glory we can't do this by ourselves if it was just us would constantly be looking back like I said earlier we'd be in the car going forward but looking back I can't get past what I used to do I can't get past what my brother did to me two or three or 20 years ago but look forward forgive and forget he forgave us and forgot like we said earlier that's all we got to do is just press toward the mark of the high calling let everything go lay aside all the doubt all the fear all the thoughts of what was and press all's now we're in close to a town of American Civil War greatness General Longstreet's buried just right up the road and I'm a big history buff so I study these things but one of my favorite generals they Stonewall Jackson you know he got the name by standing strong in a battle no offense but when all the Georgia boys were running behind they said look the stolen what looked at General Jackson he's standing there as a stone as a stone wall even as much as in the first battle getting his finger shot getting his hand shot and he stayed he stayed on his horse and told to his men they were they were knelt down he would say rise up press on rise up this evening press on even on his deathbed when he was hallucinating he think of thought he was still in battle he would say press on I say to you as a soldier in God's army this evening press on press on press on spoken word Church it won't be long it won't be long at all until the bottle is over and the victory is won hey Hebrews twelve and one I told you we'd get to it here in a minute wherefore seeing is we we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who is who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God you know back when this the scripture was wrote I believe it was the Greeks that they were referring to they were they were comparing because the Greeks when they ran a race they got to a point to where they didn't have anything on at all to get in the way of those aerodynamics where they could run faster but we had to lay aside our sin we have to lay aside our doubts and our fears and our complexes and our anxieties and and things like that and run this race that was set before us and it says in verse to who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame he joyed and dying on the cross for our sins it was a joy to him to go to that cross endure the pain suffer the shame so that you and I wouldn't have to go through all that so that we could be free this evening I don't know about you but I don't enjoy pain at all I don't enjoy any kind of little pinch or poke or anything like I can't stand needles but look at look at Jesus he found joy and dying for your sins he found joy and laying down his life so that you might live in Melchizedek the great Princeton King brother Branham says maybe that's the reefs some of us are not getting along so well we're holding on to things that we ought to let go in the separation a little doubt a little wonder a little skeptic wonder if it's right could this be could that be how could it be cut loose this morning cut loose this evening I know I and another message he refers to him as wandering stars I wonder this I wonder how I can get here I wonder how I why what I'm going through why am I going through this why am I going through that don't worry about it we all there's three phases that we all go through we're either going into a trial coming out of a trial or getting ready to start a trial and as long as the devil is fighting you that means he ain't got you yet so keep fighting this evening don't give up as a little song says don't give up don't give out don't give in just follow him Exodus 15 verses 20 and 21 and Miriam the prophetess the sister of Aaron took a timbrel in her hand and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances and Miriam answered them sing you to the Lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea your past is dead in the water it can't get back to you anymore when Miriam and the other Israelites looked back and seeing all those chariots being swallowed up by that water that they just walked through on dry land I think I would have shouted - I probably would have gave her a run for her money cuz I had to run all up and down the shores of Red Sea why because I was just delivered out of the hands of those who used to beat me who used to persecute me they used to treat me like a dog because that's all Satan does don't let him flash these shiny things out in front of you like oh here's a nice job with a good paycheck but you're gonna have to miss church don't let him throw a girl out in front of your you're a boy that's gonna tear you away from church that happened to me with the job at first but then as I like I said last night as I began to pray and seek God once I got right where I needed to be I got asked God I said lord please put me in a job or put me in a position within my job to wear that I'll be able to go to church and it didn't take long all this all happened within a span of a year maybe less and I wasn't making good money I just couldn't get on a shift where I could be at church it's not that I didn't want to be there sometimes I didn't want to be there but often times it was just because of the shift that I had to work I couldn't and I would sleep all day and miss the morning service to him Sunday but that's neither here nor there don't let anything stand between you and you were walk with God and Israel in the church number four says look what Moses done raised his hand there and singing the spirit that Miriam got a tambourine and begin to dance and jump up and down and praise God and the daughters of Israel following her dancing and praising God and shouting hallelujah they crossed over the see all the old taskmasters was back bed there in the sea they looked back and said boy you'll never bother me no more oh my burnt the bridges all over ready to go now journeying on now they can say now they say can we take it sure we can take it why God said so and remember they God promised to supply their needs can we make it to the end of this run sure we can why God said so that's not just for the Israelites that's for these Georgians they stood north carolinians the Bride of Christ we can make it because he said so and that last deal there that last sentence God promised to supply their needs God has promised to supply your needs I believe it's in the message God's medicine box where he talks about the I think it's the the brass serpent that they they prayed to or they look to and we're healed we've got a medicine boxes this right here sixty-six books full of promises full of things of different medications as it were that we would need whatever it may be whether it be deliverance whether it be a financial stability whether it be this whether it be that there's a promise for that in here there's a prescription for that in here you know I had to go to the doctor the other day and he gave me a prescription and said I want you to take this for such and such a long period of time now what would that have done if I set it on the shelf and not took it yes I believe God could help me without medicine but even the Prophet says God heals through medicine it's the same way with this word we know that promise is in there he's gave it to us but if we don't open the book and ingest it what good is it just like a medicine on the shelf after a while it may expire this these dis prescriptions never expire they're always good no matter if you have one thing here and you don't have another thing for 20 years go back and look at that prescription or that that promise for what you have need up for that moment in time and it'll be there just ready waiting for you to take him at his word don't look back don't give up the promise or that touch that healing or deliverance or whatever it is that you received keep pressing on and life story he says each one of you is a Christian you are a born-again Christian then let's stand up no matter how bad the background has been let's look forward each one of you is a Christian this evening so let's stand I'm done let's stand and confess what we've been talking about for the past a little bit stand on those promises this evening whatever it is you have need of whatever it is that you're facing look forward there's a story of a few little boys that were riding across the plank across a big ravine and each one of them they go one right after the other and they'd all fall off to the left or the right but the last little boy that came came across he made it all the way to the other end and he wanted a new bicycle I think that was the prize and they all asked him how in the world did you make it and we all fell they said I wasn't looking to the left or to the right or behind me I was looking towards the other end I was looking towards the finish line and that's how we made it that's how we got to make it this evening we got to look towards the finish line press towards the mark of the high calling press on tonight spoken word church press on brothers and sisters it won't be very long let's bow our heads Oh Heavenly Father God how we've poured out our hearts this evening no matter how simple it may have been Lord I'll I pray that it be a blessing just somebody here in our midst this evening God just a little encouragement to press on to look forward and not look back but we're all guilty of times looking back and thinking why why why can't I get where I'm going is it such and such is that this is it that that I did way back when but then you come down Lord through a simple little message like this maybe no matter if I'm preaching or brother Wade your brother Sam and one of these other brothers I just encourage your people to look forward don't worry about what's behind you keep going don't
