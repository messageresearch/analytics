withing this coming weekend will be the fellowship meeting 3:30 brother fory will be with us preaching the fellowship meeting and also the weekend for us so just remember those things and and keep us in your prayers the Wes over preaching for brother Burley this morning so remember him as they're traveling over and back Ephesians 1 and Romans 8 and you other the announcements all the announcements

that's installed downstairs they got it finished and and we will be changing a few other things and painting some things but we'll do that after the fellowship meeting but just you know uh if you see a piece of tow that's pulled sticking up a little bit don't pick it up just set your foot on it and MH it down it'll is taking time to kind of seat and do so don't pull it up and try to show it to us is just set your foot on it mice it back down and that'll stick it back to the floor all right so that'll that'll solve a lot of problems amen all right let's pray father we thank you we love you Lord and we ask you that you would just father be with it each and every one of us and that you'd give us understanding ears that we may hear what the spirit has to say unto us for this day we pray that you'd bless each one remember the sick among us and just touch each one you promised it and we believe it you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so remember each one of these Lord remember ones that are not here brother Don brother Tom brother George and these different ones that and sister Thomas Lord and the ones that are not able to come out and be with us but we pray that you would bless them exceedingly and Lord have your way with each and every one we love you and we thank you as we read your word Lord you come and speak to our hearts and just have your way now in Jesus name amen and amen we've been in Ephesians now for quite a while but we just keep on because we're still on the adoption and the things we kind of uh closed out a little bit on the predestination and now we're on the uh adoption in three stages and also we're try to make it you know stick with what we've been reading in Ephesians so if you'd like to follow along Ephesians 1 one blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his Gra Grace wherein he hath made it us accepted in the Beloved amen now we we'll go to Romans 8 reading verse 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abby father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then ours of God and Joint ours with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God you may be seated Lord add his Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now as I said we're trying to speak about adoption and we gave you the quote there the other day and and brother randam says it on the message of position in Christ paragraph uh 163 and I give you the the dates on these adoption because uh the there is a difference between the wording they use in the the what we were using of say one message formality and then the the new version that they came out from from spoken word and uh you know the voice of God recording uh so I give you the date all right that way you can check the date see like brother Joe and I were looking a minute ago on where it says like Ephesians parallels Joshua we see in the new version they don't use that title they use just adoption one adoption 2 adoption three adoption four all right if you got the red composite book that's the way it's put out but I give you the date that way you can check the date of the tape or the the book so the one position in Christ is preached in 19 uh 6522 in the evening service that brother Brown says that ask said Do You Believe In dispensations And I know people say well we don't believe in dispensations well see a dispens is like it it it's a time set or a time for something to take place or the taking place of that during the time in other words it's like setting an order of events and brother R says on that he says now there was a dispensation of Moses there was a dispensation of John the Baptist there was a dispensation uh of the the church ages in other words and he said there was a dispensation of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit he said and now is the dispensation of adoption see in the day and the age that we're in so in other words this is a time for it this is the time to come to fulfill a dispensation or or a time period that will make itself you know be made manifest during that part all right and that's what I've been trying to tell you and to talk about it is we we took the life of Jesus Christ and seeing that he came through the the stages of adoption and uh you know and doing that then we must also uh come through that or go through that stages also now it's different in the way that he went but it means the same that's the point I'm trying to get you to see because Paul was not telling the Romans the what we're we would want to read and see uh he was not uh telling them you know that uh hey uh you're already Israelites he wasn't telling them that because adoption pertained to Israel it was an Israeli custom it's good to see our visitors back there with us we always say welcome to you one time two times you're part of us but see it's in other words they Paul wasn't telling them he was telling them that you receive the spirit of adoption he wasn't telling them that you uh know all about adoption so now your adoption that took place in your your life as an Israeli you know as a a Jew uh that's not what we're talking about because see that was their custom and their ways uh see he wouldn't be saying that you you you don't need the new birth because you were already an adopted Jew see that wasn't it that's what I tried to get you to see the the difference between the Old Testament form and the New Testament see no one in the Old Testament could receive eternal life now they have to die go by the grave wait or whatever or be be you know beyond the curtain of time or whatever you want to call it in a position but they never received eternal life until Jesus Christ came and died to release that life all right then they could be taken up to a position to wait you know there and all and they could receive the eternal life there that's fine to give it to them in the in the resurrection but don't give it to them as Old Testament people cuz see that was a dispensation a time that Jesus Christ had not died but then see he comes over and when he dies then it's now we're capable of receiving eternal life and I wanted you to see that about Paul he calls it the spirit of adoption all right see trying to explain to the Romans now these Romans were are not just totally Gentile because all of this was basically to the Jews but he was trying to get them as I said to see that this because that they believed in adoption because they had come to their and I always mispronounced it but Mar barit how you say it of the the thing when they reached a certain age you know that that is uh in the natural of the the people of Israel they still do that today right but that if you went over right now you wouldn't go up to one of them and say you've already been adopted into your family so all you need is a change of the body right you wouldn't say that to them would you tell them they need to be born again Nicodemus had went through those stages right and Jesus didn't say because of you who you are and you've already been adopted no that's only an example right brother brandom as he's using it he's using the Old Testament custom of the people of Israel you know the Jews to to explain adoption to us cuz that's the same thing Paul's doing he's not telling them you're already adopted so that no he he told them that they buy the new birth cuz if you go back and read before then and you know you said if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus Christ be in you verse 11 uh you see if it raise up Christ it'll raise you up so he's talking to people with the new birth and he's telling them what the things that are to take place and by receiving that new birth they have the spirit of adoption whereby they cry out by father in other words they're in the kingdom of God cuz there was no way to get in the Kingdom of God in the Old Testament right you got to be born again to be in the kingdom of God and it could only start on the day of Pentecost cuz it was in Jesus Christ the kingdom was in him but it had to be brought into manifestation all right so I want to make sure you don't misunderstand then as we go along so then there there was a dispensation of the outpouring of the Holy Ghost there was a dispensation of to where that it was down to different stages of the church ages or a time but now we're in the dispensation of coming to understand the full measure of understanding adoption all right then it's taught in three stages all right see Jesus Christ had a a water baptism a recognition an identification a receiving of the Holy Spirit not as a new birth I put that on there because everybody wants to get so confused with it so they won't link me with somebody else's Doctrine I believe he received the new the the baptism of the Holy Ghost yeah we can say that cuz that's the way the prophet used it but as an anointing not as a new birth but as an anointing for his ministry to go forth you know and preach the gospel because that's what he goes right over immediately in the Book of Luke you find him saying that that Spirit came upon him that was Isaiah to fulfill the scripture this day that scriptures fulfilled you know all right see then in that he had a time of identification all right then he had a time of Authority or positionally placing on the amount of transfiguration and to hear ye him came into being see and truly then we'll get to it later you know how that I've already preached it many many years to us to where it says there in Romans it doesn't say that adoption to Redemption of the body it says the adoption to wh the Redemption of the body to understand right and truly Jesus understood the the uh the the Redemption of the body because he said what he said destroy this body and other words destroy this temple in 3 days I'll bring it up he understood he knew what the Redemption was about cuz he knew that that what was said over there at the the time is called the River Jordan position at his baptism to where it says this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell and brother randam interpreted that in other words or translated that into modern-day language to say this is the part of the earth that I have redeemed and from this part of the earth I'll redeem the rest of it so Jesus had understanding to it to understand he knew about the Redemption of the body all right so I'm not concerned about the body being chained right you know just like years ago I told you I said I quit trying to go to heaven people didn't understand that you know well what do you mean you don't want to go I didn't say I didn't want to go I said I quit trying to go because that was our point we always want to go to heaven go to heaven now I want heaven to come here because if God don't come here I don't go there and that's that's what I've tried to express to you for many years so is it with the I'm not concerned about the Redemption of the body I'm concerned about to Wi to understand right how this body is redeemed that's right all right and I believe that we'll come to that eventually in the the understanding because we must have our baptism not only natural but spiritual we had our water baptism and like I told you if you ref refuse to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ then don't worry about the rest of adoption you're not even in the stages yet you're not even in the journey so just forget it cuz you won't follow the word all right but see then we come to this water baptism and the natural then the spiritual and the baptism of the Holy Ghost bringing us into the body of Christ and then we can talk about the hear ye himym the adoption the authority and then go on to understand the Redemption of the body because to me it's that's what it's doing so we're in that dispens ation or time to understand uh let's the Ecclesiastes says it like this says it's a time to all times it doesn't say there's a time for all things there's a time to all things right see this is the time to understand and that's what I'm trying to get us to to to bring to that point but now this past Wednesday I know I would just got down talking to you cuz see I want you to understand so much until it gets on me to the way to try to express it and I'm sorry if I say something hard uh whatever just lay it to my old ways and ignorance and never what else you know and just say well he's just getting old but if I believe I believe if I was you and about to R and probably verify a lot of it that he's redoing the tape system for us and he told me the other day he said you're saying the same thing now you're saying then so I I I wouldn't go along with that too much but I'm just saying that I want you to understand and it doesn't matter to me to take service after service on one point to try to get it to us because the prophet said hold that up until the people gets it well bear with me maybe it's me so you bear with me till I get it all right because I want it too but see I believe you must be born again to be in the body of Christ then that way we come to what Paul is saying to the Romans that if we have the spirit verse 11 that raised up Jesus Christ in US it'll also raise us up he's he's linking the whole thing to the New Birth because the prophet said that's the most important thing in your life is the new birth because we're not even a child of God other than a natural Child by natural creation that everybody in the world is a natural Child by natur creation cuz God's the only one that can give life but see then we must be born again to be in the body of Christ all right then being born again we're just using then the natural story of a child the of the Jews Like The Prophet is using it you know a natural uh Israeli person who would come to the uh natural adoption things and as I said they're still doing that we were we happen to be there and we Act happened to view brother de s Piggy and my wife we actually viewed about a 13-year-old boy that was going through his part and you know we we were interested we we we we didn't run off we wanted to stay and and I'd like to stay there probably instead of going on with the guide but we got in trouble a few times about that anyway but it's all right uh we got we got through but uh see Paul is not telling let me repeat that I want you to understand he's not telling these people here that oh you always was eternal oh you always was this you always was that you already went through all of these stages of your adoptions and things and probably a lot of the people that he was talking to was standing there with the full signant ring of their father's adoption right you know the full Authority was invested in to them but he wasn't telling them that he wasn't saying you're all right he go back and read Romans 8 there down to that see he was telling them by the new birth see brother randam explains he said now the Corinthians had to have it explained to them over and over but he said most of the books they didn't have to explain he said especially like Ephesians or something he said because they understood well see the Romans could understand certain things so he was capable of speaking a greater depth to them of this adoption situation and expressing it to them you know but he was remember the one thing that I like what brother Brown brings out in the book of Hebrews that brother Brown says Paul was trying to get it out of those people's minds see we've been taught all of our life that Paul you know I mean it was back when we was in denomination that that Paul was telling them the Lord's coming just the Lord's coming Lord just now he was trying to get it out of their mind mind that the Lord was coming he said there must be a falling away there must be these things see get it out of your mind he wasn't telling the Romans here that you're okay he was telling them the stages they must go through to come to the position that he was trying to speak of but remember that could not take place back there before all of this could transpire we had the falling away right and then you had to have the restoration coming back in the last days in a zeusa street coming forth with the outpouring of the Holy Ghost and bringing the people back into the body of Christ in the the correct way not that nobody wasn't in there before but bringing it back to the three stages all right so then we we're we're tying it together so just get that point in mind so what would the child do now in the natural story The Prophet explains and you've read all of it and heard the message and all that he explains that that child is a child when it was born into the family but said it was not didn't have any inheritance in other words it didn't have any Authority it didn't have any recognition of those points but it was in the family all right and it was given a tutor to raise it all right and he said now you choose the best tutor you could get all right see then he goes in explaining that what see when we receive the new birth you remember how Wednesday was talking about it when we receive the new birth we receive that Spirit of adoption which is the holy spirit that's why it's called the spirit of adoption by Paul we receive the New Birth the spirit of adoption cuz it adopts us into the family see we were Gentiles totally gone and no no lineage no connection see and even the natural Jew couldn't get into the kingdom of God because he was born a natural Jew he had to be born again right to get into the kingdom of God you'd be surprised how many people of the message don't understand that cuz you listen to him preach it like one big man said one time and I heard him I wouldn't said he said I don't believe in dispensations well you brother R said you're sure out of the Bible if you don't that's now I mean so you know but of course everybody wants to say what they want to that's their business but now listen see we must have the new birth to bring us into the family of God all right that would be then like that natural baby back there as the example as the natural Israelite would be brought into the family by his natural birth think we're brought into the family by the spiritual Birth by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the prophet said God gave us the best tutor he could get he said he gave us the holy spirit all right now I've tried to say this and most of you know it you know what I'm fixing to say but I've been at this for over 30 years on that 40 years going on it see the way I look at what most people teach of adoption it's the father just going off the scene and he's never seen anymore just disappearing you know and really here comes the son boy he's strutting on you know he I I just don't understand that because I thought that the Holy Spirit and the father was a selfs sign Spirit as I said Wednesday or the prophet said Jesus had two daddies because he said the Holy Ghost was his daddy and he said his father was his daddy till he have two daddies or something's wrong so it have to be the same holy spirit so look what I'm talking about the father picked the best tutor he could get what he came himself to dwell in us now come on that's how much do we need where brother R said he didn't even send a son to die in his place that's right said he came himself all right see then the holy spirit is not another Spirit different from God right right it's God's Own Spirit dwelling in us he's wanting his nature in us so he's coming in us to start the thing maybe forgive me for language like that but God because I don't know have no other way of saying it but it's pretty good point that's the way to get it started bring us into the family by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then that is the spirit of the father that's within us right we're talking about adoption is talking about getting the nature of the father right well look behind me at the Statue of a perfect man I thought that was to bring us into the nature of the father I thought faith virt and all temp Pati god brother kind and all the nature of the father being brought into us I thought that's what adoption was that's why it took brother ROM 30 something years now this is a quote from statue of perfect man he said 30 something years before he could preach the stature of a perfect man amen not that he wasn't preaching it going back in there and get like 1956 and all like that and listen to an inter Veil where he talking about the nature of the father he'd always preached that but this nail that dams he in other words he saw how to bring it into view right all right but you see then he gives us the tutor but the tutor is not another person separate from God that's right right the tutor is the holy spirit amen which is the spirit of almighty God Amen he comes in you and I to bring forth his nature that's right no more as I said than he sent a son to die in his place no he came himself the new birth is not another Spirit separate from God to come and live in you it's God's Own Spirit his own soul his own being the prophet would say in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost see to make us a child of God so it's not the father going off the scene adoption is the father coming on the scene in his son whe it would be where he was walking on the shores of Galilee himself in flesh or whether it be in his bride around the world we are his offspring we are God made manifest in another form called a bride or a wife you know see but we're him not another person he wasn't I like Brother Richard Wilson he's always said it his way said he wasn't a second person he wasn't a third person said he's quoting brother r that he's not even the first person see if he is the first person that could mean you had another person brother said he is the person well that's just old one this well I'll just stay with it so you go what you want to because I sure do really love it like it is all right but now listen the holy spirit is the spirit of God coming into you and I to bring a new birth and it is not another spirit that God is sending right because Jesus how long do we need to stay on Jesus said I and my father come to take up our abat in you right right that's right it's expedient that I go away cuz if I don't go away the comforter won't come all right see then we're sticking with the point of understanding understanding the the true revelation of one God but now watch as I said comparing the life of Jesus Christ with with the bride of Christ M and comparing that with the natural adoption that's what I'm trying to do cuz in the natural adoption they never went on to understand the Redemption of the body right they could just go from the the baby and the coming in the family and then the authority going with it it it doesn't go on you understand so when you're talking about comparing something like brother Brown said comparing the church ages with the seals M see you can't parallel the church ages and the seals CU if you do you only got four seals and Rapture is gone you you'd have to do you can't do it so you compare that's right compare means to put them side by side and look at this and look at that and see how they bringing forth you know something in similarity because I said Jesus didn't need the new birth but we must have it that's right see so that would be a different sentence but we're comparing it to understand and bring it down to that place that's right all right so then the baptism of the Holy Ghost being the spirit of God that is what brings us into the family the spirit of God brings us into the family placing into us the tutor the Holy Spirit which is the spirit of almighty God so brother says you have in you by the new birth father Son and Holy Ghost in the New Birth you said well I don't understand that well I don't either but I just say what the prophet said I do believe that much of it to where I can can say all right see then the spirit of adoption see as I said he saying to the Romans that you have the spirit of adoption whereby you're crying by father see not telling them I keep repeating that where you'll remember it not telling them because they were Natural Born Jews that they were already in the family of God because the New Testament is the family of God the Old Testament read your Bible they're always called servants you better go back and read your Bible a little bit they're always called servants they were the servants they were not the children of God you said they were the family of God well that's just as a church as an example as a type but they wouldn't in the family of God like we are are see then the spirit of adoption is this tutor coming to raise or teach us the nature of the father amen then the Holy Spirit couldn't be another person so you can't have the father and the Holy Ghost two different persons it's got to be the same person amen that's what that man told me down at work one day he said well I I I like the way you talk and everything what he was was a Mormon and excuse me Jehovah Witness and he uh he said uh I see now that really that you understand that there's just two of them I said well that's not exactly the way I see it but uh you did get rid of one of them yeah I said why don't you just get rid of one more and me you be talking you know cuz we we have't understand it but that was just my point all right now I I want to get this into you and forgive me for just being blunt and talking like I did Wednesday but when it bues on you you got to get rid of it so forgive me of just being plain I tried to explain something this past Wednesday and explaining that I told you to please listen to that tape over and over and to not make a decision in other words until you get to the end of the tape because the end of the tape I was explaining it that when we're born again we're babies I don't care how big you are how old you are how grown you are how much knowledge you got amen I've explained it to you I had a very very uh I guess decent amount of understanding of the Bible before I came into the message because that was what I done I read and studied it you know and all and and then 2 years into the message before I received the new birth and all I was doing was reading and studying the message of the hour but I didn't call that the new birth just because I left the Baptist Church and come into the message and and you know and believing brother random was a prophet I didn't call that the new birth because to me it was not I had I knew that that was not right all right but then I watched people all the way down through in my life and the way I see it most people are trying to bring and I'll get down in a minute to the quote they're trying to make some form of rule or doctrine or or what would you call it something of this message and and and each little group has its way of saying it you know and you just listen to them and and you'd be surprised you'll see that that there's people in this message that still believe that tongues is the evidence and then they'll turn around say well I I know brother Bram didn't say that now I know he didn't but I believe that I believe it you see and they still believe that all right because it's not been revealed to them what's going on but there's people that believe in the message see that if you just dress right live right and do right that you're ready to go out of this world well now there's people in this world that a whole lot better off than we are and live better and act better that's right and you can't argue that point all right there's good Catholics that live better lives than you and I right I don't mind talking that way because it's the truth well no no no brother well see that's where you you don't understand me but you see what I think most people think that that here we are and and what we need to do we need to preach on hir and dress and clothes and you know men this away and the women that away and get rid of this and get rid of that and oh we're ready well now I admit that that make good people I admit that I believe that yeah but brother BR said you sisters don't think cuz you got long hair and dresses that makes you right come on see if you're born again and then that comes forth that's right been wonderful wonderful see now you're right that's right but babies start off as babies looking around to see what other people are doing babies don't look at their own selves to see what they're doing they don't learn looking at theirself they don't stand in the mirror and flex their muscles as I said you know to try to do like uh Arnold swash ner orever you pronounce his name you know see they look at other people and they'll copy other people they watch other people but when you're born again you're baby in Christ and you watch what everybody's doing now you don't grow in Grace and knowledge and get where you can look over what people's doing I didn't teach that I Ain never taught it I've taught if you and I grow in Grace and knowledge we can get to the place to look over not to look over it cuz it's not right to go out and do wrong that's where you get misunderstood see somebody cut it off don't listen to what you're saying babies look at what people do and judge by what they do and you know in a way that's a good point and you know babies have a right to do that cuz I've always said it if I saw you slap your child for smoking a cigarette and you stand there smoking one I might just get a little bit my rightous indonation might get up a little bit and I might kick in the shin I'm just honest you say you get mad no I wouldn't get mad I just get even with you because there's no we need of acting like that you're supposed to live before your children the way you want your children to live and not whip them for doing something you're doing and say you ain't going to do what I done we'll quit doing what you done I never done my children that way never have and I never will to whip them for something that I'm doing myself but I wanted them to live right well you start living right yourself cuz they're watching you okay but now listen see in doing it I I know it gets to the point but the way I see most people preach about adoption I've listened to them what a little bit I could hear because most people don't deal with it but most of them think that if we could preach long enough on dresses and hiring clothes that people would get adopted but I don't believe that it's just like I've always told you I believe if there 7 billion people in the world today and if every person in the world had to baptism of the Holy Ghost and was where the faith of the fathers was at they would still not be a change of the body whether you believe that or not it would be a good world to live in but it still wouldn't be the change of the body because it took the message or else why did the prophet bring it all right well the same way of what I'm talking about we can preach and we can preach about dos and don'ts and things and that's good there's people that's that's their point of preaching that's their doings you know but where will that ever bring us to the position to understand adoption it won't do it it's never done it yet all right and I wrote it down the best that I know how to write and I'm sorry see what I saw people do they try to beat the people into a place of try to beat the nature of the father into you now I don't believe in that I don't believe in it natural I don't believe in beating a nature of a father into a child I believe in whipping the child yes sir and I believe you're wrong if you don't see that's just the way I am not kill them get you good little hick and spank them and they they'll understand and that tries to help them make their nature right but that ain't going to beat your nature into it you better remember one thing your nature is displayed as I kept saying over and over daily before them if you want your children to act like you act like you're supposed to act is that plain enough everybody understand what I mean you live before them the way you want them to live then you can say well a child is acting just like the father or the mother see and that's wonderful all right but you can't beat it into and you can't beat the nature of God into anyone you know if you know I'm not talking about a stick beating I'm talking about taking doctrines and ideas and Concepts about clothes and hiring and dresses and stuff like that and just preach that preach that just preach that just preach that just preach well when they get lined up that we'll preach the Deep things but we got stay away from them deep things but see you can't beat the nature of the father into the children all right but why not do what the prophet as said had to do took him 30 something years to preach the statue of perfect man now did he just ever service from then on and I'm making a point so listen did he ever service from then on just preach we need this we need that we got to have this we got to have that we got to have this we got to have that was that his message no he went on to preach the doctrines of the Bible right the truth of the Bible not man's doctrines we've done confused it enough like it was I ain't talking about that I'm talking about he started preaching the word cuz he knew that only through the revealed word would we be able to ever attain unto anything right right that's all I'm trying to get you to see see why not preach the word bless God we preach it yeah that's about like that old man was that said you know said they said something to him saidwell why don't you preach on something besides acts 238 you know repent every want to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ in wrong he said well give me a scripture so man told him okay here it is John the Baptist standing down there and he had axe in his hand he said well that's wonderful a brother wants me to preach on that said I can do it said because John was standing down there with an axe in his hand now why did he have that ax in his hand only reason I know he had that a in his hands where he could cut away out into the into the river where he could baptize him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ see he couldn't get away that's all he could preach with acts 238 there was a time for that there was a dispensation for those things there's a dispensation of where you're learning of the message there's a dispensation of all kind of things and a time for that but now listen but see most ministers try to make you live up to a certain set of codes or doctrines yes instead of preaching the word of God all right now let's see what the prophet said let's see if that's what he said okay the message called us riseing of the sun 1965 4:18 the morning service page 11 look what he said I'm FR okay let's read now the very essence of the message that was sent that he is risen from the dead we his beneficiaries we who share the resurrection with him draw benefits from this by proving to the world that He Is Alive we cannot do it by word only we cannot do it by some tradition of man we only reflect exactly what we're pointing to I'm afraid today that too many of us are not getting now he didn't leave his out so you do what you want to with it oh he was just trying to be humble okay he's humble I'm afraid today that too many of us us are not getting people to Christ we're getting them to a church to a theory but we must get them to Christ he is the only one and the only one that has life all right so we're not getting the people to Christ we're getting them to a Doctrine an idea or a thought or a concept it goes on down to number two power of decisions 3 55 10:07 and then that one where he's uh explaining about to people being just hungry licking your lips a different that's what's the matter with the church today it's anemia I guess I pronounce that correctly which means you're you know you need something to eat because they're not getting enough spiritual food if they got the Bible brother it would put the blood of Christ into the veins of the believer new life life comes from the blood amen the anemia condition of the church pitiful pale fa pale cheek my mind we need a transfusion to start us off amen all right now what do we need to work okay going beyond the camp 1964 30719 the evening service more and more I am made to believe that people are not getting to Christ now I'm here to try to help in every way that I can and make my statement as clear as I know how to make them and you suffer with me if you will as I look and preach Across the Nation and watch the people I I I'm fully persuaded that the people are not getting to Christ I believe that it's the enemy that stroe this hindrance because the reason I believe this he is not the object that they had been pointed to now that means Christ that's Jesus not Satan all right they have either been pointed to a Dogma or doctrine or a party or experience or sensation or something like that instead of being pointed to Christ to work that's why I think that people are resting their Eternal destination upon some Dogma or some sensation like some say I danced in the spirit or I spoke with tongues I I I felt fire run over me and do you know that all those things can be impersonated by the devil there just one thing that he cannot impersonate that's the word now what is he saying we're not getting the people to Christ Christ is the revealed word okay Christ is the revealed word amen see the letter of the word is not Christ Christ is the revealed word all right so now keep keep that in mind of what he's saying and he's saying we're not getting them to Christ we're getting them to some sensation some thoughts or ideas all right now if your dependence this day is upon the fact that you shouted spoke in tongues cried whatever You' done the prophet read these points you read them over if you're dependent upon that to say you have the new birth Satan can impersonate all of it okay well you're destroying my own I'm not destroying anything cuz I've never told you not to believe that I believe a lot of people receive the Holy Ghost and they spoke in Tong I believe a lot of people receive the Holy Ghost and shouted I believe a lot of them cried I believe a lot of them this that and the other I believe in that but I don't believe that the baptism of the Holy Ghost just speaking in tongues shouting and whatever you're doing that's like the baby get the baby here first and then the baby cries the birth of the baby is one stage the next stage is the cist of effect but if your dependence is totally upon some sensation Satan can impersonate all right see and I wish to God I've always told you this you say but brother Dale you'll empty the church preaching that people needs to be born again well if I do then they know what it means they're not born again that's problem solved stage one but listen see I believe the new birth is is the birth of the word but then the sensations and the feelings and the signs the Wonders and the things you're doing to what you're saying that's what follows after the birth of the word right but you see a person that's living like the devil and then they claim these experiences and then they go on living like the devil there's something wrong get the baby changed you know word and then start on those things but brother I believe the message well amen but don't you think that the devil believes the message yes does that mean he's born again no see no that's that that that doesn't make it see we've got to have more than just some sensation or point or thought that's right we got to have the birth of the word right to be a child of God all right he said but I'm fully persuaded we're not getting them to Christ now but what are we getting them to I gave you there one on door and door is that the world will be judged by Christ and he's the word now the world won't be judged by a strong I mean a a Thompson Chain uh uh Scofield that's not exactly the way I look at it it's going to be judged by the word and Christ is the word I thought we believe that we would sit there with him and would judge the people that come forth yes I thought the bride would be sitting with him in judgment and see then a person can't deny you know anything because you're sitting there right and Flash in their mind has to would come back to the point to where you tried to help them and explain it to them all right and then they can't argue the point because there is the Living Word all right now brother brandom I believe is saying what we're not getting them to the alive person of the word which is Christ but the letter of the word as I've always told you has to be correct that was why the prophet had to come to bring us to that place all right see but now see people must be fed the word not the ideas of mankind because ideas of mankind only produce more ideas of mankind that's right all I don't like that today you know they'll say I know what's meant by it I know it but you know they'll say what's your input on this well I don't have no input input means I'm putting something in and I didn't think we're supposed to put anything in I thought we were supposed to draw out the word from God I didn't think he needed us to interpret or do anything he just needed us to stay with what he said that's right and believe it all right but you see it's going to be judged by Christ who is the word the alive word is what's going to judge people so then that's what we are here as the children of God we are the live word see but now see we we try to make some idea or some thought and and forgive me but I listen to people and I hear them you know and I I hear them never mention the the revelation of the word but oh yes they read the word yes they read the quotes yes they read the things of the Prophet but where are they talking about the word Made Alive in you where they're talking about God coming down and changing your nature I thought we supposed to have a nature change and I thought then even that after the New Birth that that was what we would to receive a total nature change that there was still something from things wrong with us that we needed to the statue of a perfect man we need the adoption but to do that we must have the revealed word all right but you see you take and forgive me but you see why in the message that you see people constantly changing churches and I'm not against you changing churches and coming here and I'm not not against you changing churches if you leave and go somewhere else I've explained that to you the only thing I ask you to do if you find more word somewhere else please come back and give us some contact with us you know at least make contact where we can can go with you or do something you know cuz I I I I want the word but you see that's why people are constantly changing it's just like you take a you notice a cow and you see a cow out and a pasture you know if they Knee Deep Grace you know never see around at the side of the fence with their head stuck out on the side of the road trying to eat the G right no am I right but if you see the pyer to where there's nothing in it old rack weeds and stuff growing up and bitter weeds and things you see the cows sticking their head through the fence right all right am I right now but if a beautiful P out there it's fertilized field and everything you on that's all growing they're not around the fence now you understand what I mean if people are fed the word they're not out hunting for the word they're not sticking their head through the fence but if you don't have enough for people to eat then they're going to stick their head to the fence and that's what I I kind of believe preacher are that they're afraid to let somebody else come in and preach cuz they might preach two bailes a Hy when they ain't never preach one to them themselves now you know what those carnal illustrations mean don't you they just preach little sugar tit things and little small thing line up and get your clothes right and somebody comes in and just takes and man that you know just takes and just dumps a whole load on you and man you just find out that there all kind of grains and wheed and corn and all that you can just eat e and just you know well no wonder the cattle want to leave and go somewhere El where they get something to eat all right why because you you get a little taste of it that's what the preachers are afraid of they're afraid to let somebody come in cuz they're afraid they'll lose a bunch of people you know that's true so there's no need of arguing with it it's not a point to argue see but now listen as a majority I just wrote it this way so I read it as a majority around the message most of the ministers are not trying to hand out spiritual food they're trying to build churches they're trying to build programs they're trying to do things and that's their business we don't have nothing to do with it all right and in doing that see they're not feeding their people and you see a lot of them running about the country and become evangelist on the field you know and going off and preaching and and they lose a lot of people because of that well see but then some of the one of the people two or three of them will come back and they really just Rejoice because you know they they think well they finally learned their lesson you know and I'm right anyway but that's nothing to me ain't going to help me one bit I'm just making a point do you believe you know the point's right words you know the point right I'm just making the point see all right but when you see somebody that has really tried to preach or to keep a you know keep the pyer up in real good shape to where the cattle can have plenty of food plenty of water you know you don't have much trouble of people running around we've had very little problems of people leaving for other things and you know some have left and and all like that but neither one of them will come back and say it was because of the word because everybody says little ain't nothing but word word word word word well that's thank God for that that's all I've ever believed that it's word word word but I want it revealed but we got to get it planted in the field that's right all right now but see that's why I've tried my best to preach to you the message and not just preach every service you know in clothes and dress and hiring cuz I seen years ago that that wouldn't do it I told you I asked brother Mo when he preached the statue of perfect man I asked him I said okay now how do we get these things and see the Lord spoke to me later and said by the opening of the word and I gave it back to you at the end of the message the prophet said with the restoration of the word will come restoration of power all right but I believe with that word being revealed is what we're to feed on and that's what we've been doing for 4 something years all right now think about it see we say but we preached one God we preach uh serpent seed we preach predestination we preached adoption but you know if if you're just just think with me just a simple illustration right I wouldn't ask for a raise of hands but how many maybe in adoption the series just learn something you didn't know before you know something was revealed to to you of the one God the water baptism he realized it couldn't happen before now come on I thought we believe predestination I thought you was listening when Brother D was preaching when I said the word is what comes predestinated eternally and there's a word for this age right brother Gary so if there's a word for this age and that word ain't been reveal to Brother Gary then we can't leave that's right amen but get the point of what I'm saying you do at least say God has revealed something to you recently right all right see then if he's revealed something to you recently not maybe me preaching or anybody whatever just God revealed you know that the time couldn't take place cuz there was a dispensation that was waiting for that to take place and if there's more to be revealed there's more word to be made alive right then the change won't come until the word is completely finished that's to be made alive there's their their thing it's the preaching of the word that's supposed to bring us up the stature of a perfect man it's the preaching of the word that's supposed to bring the nature of the father because I thought I gave you a quote in there were that that that Jesus I mean that God was his word now if he's his word then that's what I want reveal amen yeah and if there's something to be revealed to us then it won't take place until that's finished being revealed is that that sensible you you shouldn't need anything to help you understand that but you know yourself that I brought in a people brought in people to try to help you understand instead of trying to keep them away cuz I want you to understand and I know and realize sometimes that I I'm one that knows for certain that brother Dale's not all of the fivefold ministry I know that for certainty I believe in a fful Ministry and I tried to bring men to help you and to help me because you know I learn and I go listen to the five4 ministry cuz remember that's that's what we're to do all right but not just pound people about something but preach the gospel the scripture says the gospel is what the power of God unto salvation is that scripture the gospel is the power of God under salvation well then why have we not tried to preach the gospel of course everybody says they have right all that those that just still preaching 40 years ago they preaching high and dress and clothes they still preaching high and dress and clothes they say they're preaching the gospel well why didn't brother Ram was I said why didn't he just stop on the Statue of perfect man and just stay there preaching the statute of perfect man over and over for the next three and a half years or 3 years somewhere the life no he went on into the preaching of the word because he saw and real realiz the only way that we would be able to come to it would be what as he said this messenger Malachi Force to do two things what turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers number one right he said and bring us the Revelation the seven the Thunders which is revelation containing the Seven Seals and these would be the things that would literally turn our hearts back so he knew had to go on preaching it and bring the message to us right see and that's all I've tried to do see not pound on you but try to preach unto you cuz preaching unto you the nature of the Father by the revealed word will bring the nature of the father in you when it's revealed to you because it's not going to do it for for pounding it's not going to take place that way all right you said well brother D give me scripture for that give me scripture for the fact that you believe that that through the opening of the word will bring these things to P well okay then if you look over in Romans 10 you'll find the scripture says what 1017 Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God and we know the scripture said that is revealed from what faith to Faith see all right then listen then if you believe that we become a child of God by the revealing of the word which is what brother Bron said on number five on your notes there a paragraph 71 patus Vision 1960 1204 the evening says you're saved by Revelation and says the only way you can be saved is by Revelation he said other than that you got an intellectual see so if you can't be saved only by revelation of the word of God then you see why I believe and I believe that is true see then you see why did I believe that a child can only grow into the nature or a character of the Father by the revealing of the nature of the Father by the revealed word I believe that's what's taking place I believe the seals the things like that is revealing the nature of the father amen unto us by the revealed word we see people are say but brother Dale we preach these things well all right but is it fully revealed Has It produced the nature of the father right that's just as plain as it can be could it be we've tried to preach our own ideas about these things and call it revelation you said but I don't believe I don't believe Brother D preaching them deep things you get all confused and you confused to people no the people are already confused you're not going to get confused reading the word of Goden you're not going to get confused studying this message you're not going to get confused hearing somebody preacher the deeper things of the message you are already confused it's exposed our confusion all right I gave you some quotes where brother Brown said you must be born again he said it's not Sensations and things like that but you must be borned by the word born by the word conflict 1962 3 531 number8 on you know you mourn by the word read these real good and listen to what your Prophet has to say do you see what I'm trying to get you to see now I'm asking you do you see what I'm trying to get you to see I'm not asking you to believe me I never have asked you to do that see if we teach the word of God to the people then the Holy Spirit can make it alive that's right right now up to the 5old ministry now did your Prophet make these statements he said I break these down as big nuggets he said it's up to the 5old ministry to break it down to where it can be explained to the people now I didn't make them statements your Prophet made it right but see the Bible says the fivefold ministry is for the perfecting of the Saints until we all come to the unity of the faith right now so then we must have a five-fold Ministry well brother Dale what about these people see everybody wants to make an excuse what about these people that where they can't get to a preacher well you got a problem now cuz you can get an internet few years ago may have been a problem the God just takes them out of the way with what's cost you know science and and new things and he just brings things to where you can just turn on a computer and you can just listen to people right so there's no excuse now well we just can't get together where you know it's too far yeah and you got $100,000 laying in the bank account that that the world's going to fix to take away from you but you ain't going to spend it going to church that's all right no my business I ain't never asked for nobody no money people are surprised when they do on the internet and come back to us and we say no charge yeah but we want to do no charge why cuz we're not trying to get rich we're trying to spread the gospel and you know the reason why I told you here a while back we're trying to spread it because these preachers ain't going to preach it so I just opened up said okay loosen it up Let It Go on the internet then who wants to hear can hear call me in you want to but there's a lot of people listening today around the world and I hope that it's helping them and I've never asked one of them for a dime and never have told none of them to call me their Pastor I always direct them back to their pastor but you know what brother Brown said he said if your pastor won't preach the truth what' he say do now what' he say do come on somebody tell me what brother R said do said get away from him thank you so you know he said it well you're just trying to bust up churches I'm trying to get the word out all I've ever tried to do see because we have the inside teacher but brother Ram says that the holy spirit is sitting in you waiting on you to bring him the word well I thought he know the word see that's where you don't understand you ain't been taught for 40 years of truth of understanding you're still thinking well I thought he the Holy Ghost knows everything we don't need no teachers called got teacher inside of us the prophet said why did he put teachers in the body that's right now I wrote it like this brother brandom said on the message Ephesians parallels Joshua you've heard that over and over and over that's 196 5:15 the evening service where you'll know what it is number 10 on your notes he said preaching catches The Sinner now listen but he said teaching positionally places you in the body okay of course the teacher he wants to strut right there don't he but I'm going to just clip the strut out and under you cuz I don't believe it you call me a teacher I don't believe that I'm the only one that can teach I believe the fivefold ministry fivefold Ministry that is called of God all right everybody know what I'm saying the true fful ministry that's called of God each one of them is capable of teaching in the capacity of their office so brother random didn't label just the teacher here he didn't say just that read what he saying he said teaching positionally placed it he didn't say the teacher positionally placed you he said teaching positionally places you right he didn't label it down to hear in one person it's a five-fold Ministry and each one is supposed to be able to teach in the capacity that they're in so teaching positionally places you whether you're sitting under a pastor today and that Pastor is teaching you the word then you're exactly right in what the prophet said amen but then there is a teachers that are in the body of Christ that you know that the prophet said nobody can touch the teacher now he did label that did he say those things nobody can touch the teacher now he put it there he didn't say nobody can touch the teaching but here he's saying nobody can that the the teaching of the word is what positionally places you and I so the five-fold ministry is called for the perfecting of the Saints according to the scripture until we come to the UN of the faith that's why I believe in the five4 ministry that's why I bring in people to try to help you the five4 ministry because I know as I said I know and realize that I can't do it all by myself and it can't be done so you bring in somebody to try to get somebody to hell because that'll bring you to the place and we'll go with one that he did say the last one I gave you you looked at the last one to gave you I didn't say this he said you'll never live no higher than your pastor he said you'll never live no higher than your pastor well brother D this means we got to depend on yeah that's exactly right that means we got to depend on somebody but you know this is one Pastor that knows he's got to depend upon the other fivefold Ministry I've got to hear Faith don't come by reading Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God in other words a prophet would say hearing then by the revealed word that some preacher stands forth and preaches unto you all right so I believe that was placed correctly I don't know what you think about it but it's teaching that positionally places you yes not the teacher but then to reject the teacher is what's wrong with a lot of people that they can't teach themselves simple that ain't going to get me no opportunities to go anywhere and preach and I'm not going to do it I don't worry me that's why I opened up the internet because I've told you before see I thought Wade would be able to go I thought these other ministers would be able to carry the message cuz I realized what they were thinking about me intellectual all this that and the other but that's their business I don't I don't get offended at anybody because of that I thought W could go and carry the message but See's not much popular More than I am but because I've never taught you anything like that I've tried my best and you come and show me where I've missed it you come show me where I've ever taught anything to Prophet didn't teach that's an open challenge to the world that's why we haven't got into all these doctrines of Two Souls seventh thund virtues perusia the river Jordans the no Holy Ghost doctrines of son of mans and all of these other things because we just simply just tried to cluck alone here and the five-fold ministry here has been a wonderful help to me you know the ministers here to help me to understand and help preach to me you know and I thank God for them you know cuz they've been a help to me and that's what I depend on but see I don't believe that that preaching this this little things is going to bring the bride to Perfection let's stand come on brother mus this it's not going to do it it's going to take the preaching of the word that's what I've always believed that's what I've always tried to teach you because I didn't put it it own need in Mage where brother around said with the restoration of word comes restoration of power what you want want Power like I told you I've sat and talked with ministers I've listened to people over the years there's a group goes that way and they say we got everything when we believe good Baptist Doctrine they said they believe the message they got the Holy Ghost they got everything the other group goes this way and says we ain't got nothing well I I want to be somewhere in between there you know to hold on to the word of God and believe what we've got and don't deny what God has done Among Us amen we have seen the sick heel the dead rais we've seen rain come we've seen rain leave we've seen storms spoken out of existence we've seen all kind of things stand here all afternoon talk about them this documented to where that like we stood and walked right out here when they said the war started in Kuwait you remember that I walked right out here in the back room and I said according to what God just revealed to me we're not ready yet cuz see Kuwait was right there so close to Israel cuz that could cause War just like that with Israel had Israel jumped their bombs on Kuwait we would have been in a world war but they would frame they got kept them from doing it but I said we can pray because God showed me we're not where we're supposed to be so we can pray and ask God to bind all the forces of the enemy and that they will not be able to use their forces against us they were buried in the ground waiting on us to pass over them and then they were going to just run right up behind us and trap us and all kind of things but the Russians forgot to tell them that to bury those tanks in the ground meant the moisture would build up and they'd rust it wouldn't work the we lost more people by our own friendly fire in Kuwait than we did by the enemy why because I believe that the Lord told me to come out here and let's do that now I didn't just say it I said it I said now let's pray and that happened see those are documented just don't have to worry about it we're not talking about something that ain't documented but you see all I want to do is preach the word and God he'll have to reveal it cuz we can't reveal it anyway go ahead brother 597 that's father 597 anybody have a need than on these found his graes all every while I and and Jesus I am free and free joy un
