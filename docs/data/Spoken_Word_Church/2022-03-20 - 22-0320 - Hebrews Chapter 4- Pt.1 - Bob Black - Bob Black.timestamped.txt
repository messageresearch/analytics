[0:27] day well yesterday we had so much uh
[0:30] such a good time and in the lord and
[0:34] really enjoyed the services yesterday
[0:41] so we're um
[0:43] we made it to hebrews chapter four
[0:46] let's just
[0:47] let's just give the lord in prayer
[0:48] before we get into this study
[0:51] well we thank you god for your for
[0:52] allowing us to come together together
[0:54] around your word and we praise these we
[0:56] study these things out that you'll just
[0:57] be with us and open these things up to
[0:59] our heart lord and
[1:00] lord uh you'll just bless the service
[1:03] this morning lord and and let us receive
[1:05] whatever we have need of lord we ask in
[1:06] your name
[1:08] amen
[1:10] so
[1:11] before we get into hebrews chapter 4 i
[1:13] just want to kind of remind you of the
[1:15] the little pattern you know when you
[1:16] read the scripture you kind of look for
[1:17] a little for patterns and things and and
[1:20] to kind of help to
[1:23] help our understanding and
[1:25] paul was following this kind of a little
[1:27] pattern here in hebrews chapter one
[1:28] where he started off with saying who
[1:31] christ was and he said him that he sat
[1:33] down on the right hand of the majesty on
[1:34] high and we know that that kind of
[1:36] patterns out with with uh you know god
[1:38] has a throne in heaven and he and he sat
[1:40] down in the throne of christ and
[1:43] on earth and then he sat down in the
[1:45] throne of our heart
[1:46] when on the day of pentecost
[1:48] and so paul's setting down this pattern
[1:50] that you've got a starting point and
[1:51] then hebrews chapter three we were just
[1:54] going through it said he said harden not
[1:56] your hearts is in the provocation and
[1:57] the day of temptation in the wilderness
[2:00] so once you once you get started then
[2:02] you've got you've got a labor that you
[2:04] go through and you begin to labor and
[2:05] it's like like a ox labor and going
[2:08] going uh
[2:09] pulling a burden and uh you know brother
[2:11] branham would say he would say things
[2:13] like um you know you start coming to
[2:15] church and you you uh you don't quite
[2:17] fit in and you're wondering how things
[2:19] work and you try to work things out
[2:21] yourself so that you you try to you say
[2:23] well i'm gonna make it work and you try
[2:25] to
[2:25] you try to you you slip up and you fall
[2:27] you say well i'm gonna make it work and
[2:29] you try to try to
[2:30] get things going in your life and
[2:32] there's a labor but then then you come
[2:35] paul is talking about in hebrews chapter
[2:37] four let us therefore fear unless the
[2:39] promise being left of us
[2:41] lest us of left us of entering into his
[2:44] rest
[2:45] what we're laboring for is to enter into
[2:47] that rest
[2:49] less lest any of us
[2:52] let us therefore fear lest a promise
[2:54] being left us of entering into his rest
[2:56] any of you should seem to come short of
[2:58] it
[2:59] so now the reason that they did not come
[3:01] into the to the promise of the rest as
[3:03] they were journeying through the
[3:04] wilderness was because they failed to
[3:06] believe god's word they failed to as
[3:09] they as they came to each of those
[3:10] testing places they failed to believe
[3:12] that god was with them that god had
[3:13] raised up moses for the purpose that
[3:15] that their purpose was to go into the
[3:17] promised land
[3:19] the baptism of the holy ghost
[3:22] so
[3:23] on the next slide
[3:25] look at look at that pattern now so
[3:26] believe
[3:27] labor rest
[3:29] believe labor and rest and you know
[3:31] there's a quote that brother ram said in
[3:33] demonology where he said if you can be
[3:35] in a justified state without being
[3:37] sanctified
[3:38] you can believe
[3:40] so you start out believing
[3:41] some you hear a preacher preach about
[3:44] that you can be saved and start
[3:45] preaching things and you and it kind of
[3:47] catches your attention and you say you
[3:48] know i think there's something to this
[3:50] and you start coming to church and you
[3:52] can believe on the lord jesus christ
[3:53] christ and still carry your filth with
[3:56] you
[3:56] you believe but yeah there's you you
[3:59] start laboring out i i've got to i want
[4:02] to get rid of these things in my life
[4:03] and you try to do it your own self and
[4:05] you start working you try to work to get
[4:07] rid of it yourself
[4:08] and then you begin to realize that you
[4:10] can't do it yourself
[4:11] that it takes it takes more than than
[4:13] you're able to do
[4:15] there's got to be something else to
[4:16] happen
[4:18] and he said you can absolutely live in
[4:19] both a justified and a clean holy life
[4:22] and without the holy ghost so you can
[4:23] see that takes the holy ghost to live
[4:25] this life
[4:27] but look at this pattern
[4:29] believe labor rest
[4:32] so you're justified and then you begin
[4:34] to labor and then you're born
[4:36] rest
[4:37] you're born and then then that pattern
[4:40] then that pattern starts again
[4:43] you're born now you start laboring as
[4:46] you're trying to figure what is this
[4:47] seven seals about what is what are all
[4:49] these deep things and you're trying to
[4:51] be probing and pondering and you're
[4:52] you're going and you're studying things
[4:54] out and you're not at rest yet you're at
[4:57] rest
[4:58] what a paradox that you can be at rest
[4:59] but not at rest
[5:01] you're at rest but you're you're
[5:03] laboring and you're trying to get
[5:04] somewhere
[5:05] then finally you get to a place where
[5:07] these these this seven seals can be
[5:09] opened up to you and the the mysteries
[5:10] can be opened up to you and god can
[5:12] actually begin to reveal to you to think
[5:14] the word the message than the way that
[5:15] he wanted it to be taught to understood
[5:18] but yet
[5:19] yet then
[5:21] then you still got some more labor
[5:23] like remember jesus on when he went up
[5:25] to the mount of transfiguration and a
[5:26] voice from heaven said hear ye him and
[5:28] he was
[5:29] coming to that place you know in type of
[5:31] speaking conditions but yet he went
[5:33] straight to the cross
[5:34] straight to the garden of gethsemane
[5:36] labor and father let this cup pass from
[5:38] me labor because there's yet something
[5:40] that's got to die
[5:42] until you finally come what's our
[5:43] ultimate resting place
[5:45] your ultimate resting place was the
[5:47] baptist monolith will take you into the
[5:49] presence of god your body spirit and
[5:51] soul
[5:52] that your body will be changed and
[5:54] you'll be at rest with god
[5:56] that your body will be transformed
[5:58] so look at this pattern
[6:01] and the bible said now we're we're
[6:02] making our way to hebrews chapter four
[6:05] the bible says in john chapter 16 that
[6:08] before before you rest you got to have
[6:10] labor before a baby's born there's going
[6:12] to be labor it's called labor pains
[6:15] labor now think about that pattern that
[6:16] we just looked at
[6:18] before you were born there's labor
[6:20] that's what you can't take the labor out
[6:21] of it you can't take the crying and the
[6:23] praying and the all the the labor out of
[6:25] it and the searching through the
[6:26] scriptures
[6:28] and then after you're born again
[6:30] we're supposed to be born according to
[6:32] the malachi 456
[6:35] born a new birth according to malafi 456
[6:38] where we're restored back to the
[6:40] original faith of the fathers
[6:43] restore that kind of birth and that kind
[6:46] of birth also requires a labor
[6:48] you see see how these types these types
[6:51] is
[6:52] is simple but it repeats itself what's
[6:54] repeating itself
[6:56] justification sanctification the baptism
[6:59] of the holy ghost
[7:01] a woman when she is in travail she's
[7:03] laboring hath sorrow because her hour
[7:05] has come but as soon as she's delivered
[7:07] of the child
[7:08] she remembereth no more the anguish
[7:11] for joy that a man is born into the
[7:13] world now what happens after all that
[7:15] labor
[7:17] a life comes into that baby
[7:19] now the baby is in his mother's arms and
[7:22] there's rest
[7:23] so see how this pattern repeats believe
[7:26] labor rest
[7:29] paul said in hebrews chapter 4 let us
[7:31] let us therefore fear
[7:34] unless the promise being left us of
[7:36] entering into his rest
[7:39] any of you should seem to come short of
[7:41] it
[7:42] for unto us was the gospel preached
[7:45] as well as unto them but the word
[7:48] preached and not profit them not being
[7:50] mixed with faith
[7:51] and them that heard it
[7:53] for we which have believed do enter into
[7:56] rest as he said as i have sworn in my
[7:58] wrath if they shall enter into my rest
[8:01] although the works were finished from
[8:03] the foundation of the world
[8:05] for he spake in a certain place of the
[8:07] seventh day on this wise
[8:09] and god did rest the seventh day from
[8:11] all his works
[8:13] and in this place again
[8:15] if they shall enter into my rest
[8:17] now see how even as i as as i read these
[8:20] words
[8:21] they mean things different things to
[8:23] different people depending on where you
[8:25] are are you born again
[8:27] now if you're not born again
[8:29] then you'll be you're laboring
[8:32] to get rid of things in your life that
[8:34] shouldn't be there you're laboring to
[8:35] come to a place where where you know
[8:37] what it means to be a christian if
[8:39] you're born again you're laboring to
[8:41] understand the deeper things of god to
[8:43] understand what work to be placed to
[8:45] understand how you how you're placed in
[8:47] the church you're laboring to
[8:49] and and you don't understand maybe
[8:50] you're trying to work those things out
[8:52] but what we're trying what we're going
[8:54] toward is rest now what is rest
[8:57] rest now i got this you just pick this
[8:59] maybe a little bit humorous but rest
[9:02] what what what is our rest from
[9:04] let's really nail that down
[9:06] remember when the last time we were
[9:08] reading where the the lie that satan
[9:09] told eve was thou shalt not surely die
[9:12] because god said god said if you eat
[9:14] from the tree of knowledge of good and
[9:16] evil you're gonna die
[9:17] die
[9:18] so now now we're in this place where
[9:21] we're in a we're in a state of death you
[9:23] know you get sick and you're you're
[9:25] struggling and and if you're not born
[9:27] again you're wondering uh you you're
[9:29] wondering what's going to happen to me
[9:30] if i die
[9:32] and atheists in the world wondering
[9:33] what's going to happen after after death
[9:35] do we just kind of peter out and things
[9:37] go into darkness and your life ends and
[9:39] is there is there anything after death
[9:42] so what what were what we're not at rest
[9:44] of of in or or about is is the whole
[9:48] whole question of death death is is what
[9:52] we're we're laboring to escape
[9:54] death so now the bible says when we pass
[9:57] from death when we pass from death unto
[10:00] life
[10:01] when you pass from death to life then
[10:03] the death question is answered and now
[10:06] you're at rest you see
[10:10] rest brother brown said is to have
[10:11] everlasting arrest from all their
[10:14] troubles and all their worries
[10:16] no more task masters now these are
[10:18] brother brown's words
[10:19] no more taskmasters
[10:21] no what's the taskmaster taskmaster is
[10:24] is like the devil kind of he he'll get
[10:26] on somebody and they
[10:27] they feel like they just can't get away
[10:29] from cigarettes and they can't get away
[10:30] from doing things wrong and hating one
[10:32] another and and foul thoughts and foul
[10:35] ideas and foul things coming out of your
[10:36] mouth and the task master is just
[10:38] driving you and but but that's what rest
[10:40] is god god give us the holy ghost so
[10:43] that we could be at rest
[10:45] no more restless nights restless nights
[10:48] wondering what's going to happen to you
[10:49] if you die what restless nights worrying
[10:51] about your family worrying about things
[10:53] rest
[10:55] that's what god wants us to have is rest
[10:57] he said they were on their way to the
[10:59] promised land of rest
[11:00] it flowed with milk and honey the grapes
[11:03] was so big that two men packed one bunch
[11:07] over their shoulders
[11:08] that's the promise that god wanted to
[11:10] give them was that kind of arrest where
[11:12] well they had they had milk and honey
[11:14] all around and everything every every
[11:16] spiritual blessing that god could give
[11:19] on and one of the greatest examples i
[11:20] could think of rest you think about rest
[11:23] is
[11:24] rest is on the inside on the inside you
[11:27] know that the death question is settled
[11:30] that if you were to die you would go
[11:32] straight into the presence of god
[11:34] and so it doesn't matter when all of
[11:36] circumstances and things are tossed your
[11:38] way it doesn't matter i mean it's it's
[11:41] rough it's hard life is hard because
[11:44] they're still after you're boiling again
[11:45] there's still a labor that you're going
[11:47] through there's things that life
[11:49] squeezes in on you but yes yet the death
[11:52] question has been settled
[11:54] because you've passed from death into
[11:56] life
[11:57] now look at this picture
[11:59] jesus there in the boat
[12:01] asleep at rest
[12:03] because he knew who he was he was at
[12:05] rest that life was down on the inside
[12:07] and the boat was being tossed about the
[12:09] storm and all the other disciples were
[12:12] running about
[12:13] frantically trying to trying to figure
[12:15] out what what do we need to do do we
[12:16] need to bail the boat out do we need to
[12:19] do we need to get this get the sails
[12:21] erected do we do we need to row this way
[12:23] or that way and wondering what to do but
[12:25] yet jesus was at rest
[12:30] brother brown said in hebrews chapter
[12:33] four he said
[12:34] which is what we're talking about he
[12:36] said now the thought is
[12:38] if we are on our way to the rest
[12:41] what is the rest
[12:43] where is it
[12:45] i think about that this morning
[12:48] is it joining church
[12:49] if you join if you join church and sit
[12:51] in a pew is that does that settle the
[12:53] death question
[12:55] are you settled down on the inside to be
[12:57] to be sitting here next to other
[12:59] believers
[13:01] is it being baptized a certain way if we
[13:03] say we got well we got our doctrine
[13:04] right we know how to be baptized whether
[13:07] it's frontwards or backwards or all the
[13:09] way or part way
[13:11] if we got all these things settled does
[13:13] that settle the death question down on
[13:15] the inside are you at rest do you have
[13:17] peace
[13:18] that if you were to die on the way home
[13:19] from church tonight
[13:21] that you will go straight into the arms
[13:23] of god
[13:24] is it becoming a member of the greatest
[13:26] church in the city wearing better
[13:28] clothes
[13:29] is it education
[13:31] is it money so we can quit work and just
[13:33] lay down rest the rest of our life as we
[13:35] call it
[13:36] when you think about that look at all
[13:38] the rich people of the world the bill
[13:40] gates and elon musk and all the ones
[13:42] that have billions in the bank does that
[13:44] give you rest despite all the money that
[13:47] they've got in the bank yeah if that
[13:49] doesn't settle the that's quit the death
[13:51] question he said that's not it
[13:59] now the word sabbath
[14:01] i got this definition the jewish sabbath
[14:03] from it comes from the hebrew shabbat to
[14:05] rest it's observed throughout the year
[14:07] on the seventh day of the week saturday
[14:09] and the old testament the seventh day
[14:11] was saturday well the seventh day is
[14:13] still saturday according to biblical
[14:15] tradition that commemorates the original
[14:17] seventh day in which god rested after
[14:19] complete completing the creation because
[14:21] in genesis chapter two it says
[14:23] thus the heavens and the earth were
[14:25] finished and all the host of them
[14:27] and on the seventh day
[14:29] god ended his work which he had made
[14:32] and he rested on the seventh day
[14:34] from all his work which he had made
[14:36] let's see see that how that pattern
[14:38] repeats even and and he began to labor
[14:41] he labored and he labored at through six
[14:44] days and then he rested at the end and
[14:46] god blessed the seventh day and
[14:48] sanctified it because that in the he
[14:51] that because that in it he had rested
[14:54] from all his work which god created and
[14:57] made
[14:58] and in deuteronomy
[15:01] the fourth commandment
[15:03] was six days shout thou labor
[15:05] and do all that work
[15:07] but the seventh day
[15:09] is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it
[15:12] thou shalt not do any work
[15:14] thou nor thy son nor thy daughter nor
[15:16] thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor
[15:19] thy knox nor thine ass nor any of the
[15:22] cattle nor thy stranger that is within
[15:24] thy gates
[15:26] that thy manservant and thy maidservant
[15:28] may rest
[15:30] as well
[15:31] as thou
[15:34] now the fourth commandment you remember
[15:36] that how we read about moses went up to
[15:38] the top of the the top of the mountain
[15:40] and he came down with the ten
[15:41] commandments and brother adam said those
[15:43] were the seals what what were the ten
[15:44] commandments the ten commandments were
[15:46] the attributes of god that he wanted to
[15:48] display in his people that you would you
[15:50] would serve the lord thy god with all
[15:51] your heart and all your soul and he
[15:53] would honor that uh
[15:55] honor that father and mother and you
[15:56] would uh love your neighbor
[15:59] and all of those things but you know
[16:00] when when jesus began to preach the ten
[16:03] commandments on the on the sermon on the
[16:05] mountain when he began to relay talk
[16:07] about the beatitudes and things brother
[16:09] brown said he left out he left out the
[16:11] fourth commandment he began to magnify
[16:14] the law and and and explain how that
[16:17] what those ten commandments really were
[16:19] the spiritual application but he left
[16:21] out the fourth commandment
[16:23] now now there there's something really
[16:25] important here that that we need to see
[16:27] because when when jesus was preaching
[16:29] about the the ten commandments there he
[16:31] he he preached it in a way so that you
[16:34] would they would begin to understand
[16:35] that
[16:36] there was something something about that
[16:39] something about the ten commandments
[16:40] that you could not satisfy yourself
[16:43] you could try to live a good life you
[16:45] could try to try to be a good person but
[16:47] he opened these things up in a way that
[16:49] that to begin to prick people in their
[16:51] heart to know that
[16:52] you need the spirit of god
[16:55] like like the brother was preaching
[16:56] yesterday about how the samson
[16:59] samson's life would have been nothing
[17:00] without the spirit of god in his life
[17:04] so let's let's look at what jesus said
[17:05] as he was preaching
[17:07] leaving out the fourth commandment as he
[17:09] was preaching all the all these ten
[17:11] commandments we'll just kind of examine
[17:12] a few things that he said
[17:14] because in matthew chapter five and
[17:16] again we're talking about rest coming to
[17:18] a place where we're at rest he said
[17:20] think not that i am come to destroy the
[17:22] law or the prophets i am not come to
[17:25] destroy but to fulfill
[17:27] and how is he how is he going to fulfill
[17:29] the law in the prophets how he's going
[17:31] to fulfill it he's going to fulfill it
[17:32] by taking his life
[17:34] and yielding it on the cross and on the
[17:36] day of pentecost giving it back to you
[17:39] and that'll fulfill everything that was
[17:41] written
[17:42] for verily i say unto you till heaven
[17:44] and earth pass one jot or one little one
[17:46] tittle shall in no wise pass from the
[17:48] law
[17:49] till all be fulfilled
[17:51] whosoever therefore shall break one of
[17:54] these least commandments
[17:56] and shall teach men so he shall be
[17:58] called the least in the kingdom of
[18:00] heaven but whosoever shall do and teach
[18:02] them the same shall be called great in
[18:05] the kingdom of heaven so let's take a
[18:07] look at the way that jesus broke these
[18:10] commandments down and i got these little
[18:12] images up here a little bit funny i
[18:13] guess but
[18:14] the point is we're trying to make the he
[18:17] as he broke these commandments down he
[18:19] he's explaining there's something that
[18:21] that you need beyond your own works
[18:23] there's something beyond just the the
[18:25] religiosity of the pharisees and the
[18:27] sadducees
[18:28] there's something beyond just just going
[18:30] to church and saying you're a good
[18:32] christian
[18:33] so in matthew chapter 5
[18:35] he said ye have heard that it was said
[18:37] by them of old time
[18:38] thou shalt not kill
[18:40] and whosoever shall kill shall be in
[18:42] danger of the judgment
[18:44] but i say unto you
[18:46] that whosoever is angry with his brother
[18:49] without a cause
[18:51] shall be in danger of that now see how
[18:53] in the old testament you could say well
[18:54] i've met the requirement i've never
[18:56] killed anybody so i met the requirement
[18:58] but he magnified it to the place where
[19:00] you can't meet that requirement unless
[19:03] you've got the holy ghost
[19:05] unless you're at rest unless god's life
[19:08] comes and lives in you and changes your
[19:11] heart so now he exposes it that it's a
[19:14] heart problem how do you get where why
[19:17] are we not at rest if you're not born
[19:19] again because there's a problem with
[19:21] your heart that's where the problem is
[19:24] with your heart
[19:25] whosoever is angry with his brother
[19:28] without a cause shall be in danger of
[19:31] the judgment and whosoever shall say to
[19:33] his brother raqqa shall be in danger of
[19:35] the counsel but whosoever shall say thou
[19:37] fool shall be in danger of hell fire
[19:41] therefore if thou bring thy gift to the
[19:43] altar
[19:44] and their remembrance that thy brother
[19:46] hath all against thee leave there thy
[19:48] gift before the altar and go thy way
[19:51] first be reconciled with my brother and
[19:53] then come and offer thy gift
[19:55] now look at all these different examples
[19:57] he's he's using that that if you if you
[19:59] if you if you're angry with your brother
[20:01] without a cause
[20:04] you'll be in danger of the judgment
[20:06] if you say to your brother you're
[20:08] empty-headed like that's the insult that
[20:10] they use you're empty you're worth
[20:11] nothing
[20:12] you'll be in danger of the council but
[20:14] if if you say you you fool you're you're
[20:17] you're not even
[20:19] is there any good in you
[20:21] shall be in danger of hell fire in other
[20:23] words the problem starts from down in
[20:26] your heart in your soul
[20:28] the problem starts from there and if
[20:30] you're angry with your brother without a
[20:32] cause
[20:34] then you're just then you're guilty of
[20:36] murder just as the same
[20:39] as now see why why did he say you're
[20:41] guilty of murder
[20:42] as as we're running out of time here is
[20:44] because because that goes back to where
[20:47] the problem started with cain and abel
[20:50] that cain hated abel without a cause
[20:54] why did he hate him because because just
[20:56] because he told him the truth
[20:58] and he hated it there was something
[21:00] wrong with his heart he hated him
[21:01] without a cause
[21:02] and killed him and killed him and so
[21:05] jesus is going back to those those
[21:06] stories joseph's brother and hated him
[21:08] without a cause
[21:10] without a cause and threw him in the
[21:12] well
[21:14] saul hated david without a cause why did
[21:16] he why did he throw that javelin at him
[21:18] because david david was just trying to
[21:20] do right there was nothing wrong no
[21:22] nothing that david was doing that was
[21:23] wrong he was just trying to be a good
[21:25] god-fearing person and the pharisees and
[21:28] sadducees hated jesus without a cause
[21:31] you see how when you hate somebody
[21:33] without a cause many times it's because
[21:35] they're telling you the truth or because
[21:37] they're trying to live a godly life in
[21:39] front of you you hate them because they
[21:41] don't dress the way that you do or they
[21:43] you hate them because they don't drink
[21:45] alcohol with you
[21:46] after work after you go to work and they
[21:48] don't want to go to the places that you
[21:50] go to and you hate them you don't know
[21:51] why you hate them but you just hate them
[21:53] because there's coming is coming from a
[21:55] place
[21:56] a place of a of a a cankered heart
[21:59] but if you can get that heart problem
[22:01] fixed
[22:03] then you'll be at rest
[22:07] that's why i got this picture here see
[22:08] the guy with his hand over his heart
[22:10] because the heart is the problem
[22:13] in matthew chapter 5 you have heard that
[22:15] it was said by them of old time thou
[22:17] shalt not commit adultery but i say
[22:19] indeed
[22:20] that whosoever looketh on a woman
[22:23] to lust after her hath committed
[22:25] adultery with her already
[22:27] where
[22:28] in his heart
[22:29] and his heart because there's something
[22:31] wrong
[22:32] with a man that would look after look
[22:34] after somebody that's not his wife and
[22:36] lust after her there's something wrong
[22:38] there's something wrong there and if you
[22:40] can fix that problem you can't fix it by
[22:42] your own works or your own doings or
[22:44] your own labor
[22:46] but you can fit get it fixed by the
[22:48] baptism of the holy ghost
[22:50] and jesus said if thy right i offend
[22:52] thee not listen to this if thy right i
[22:53] offend thee pluck it out and cast it
[22:56] from thee for it is profitable for thee
[22:58] that one of thy members should perish
[23:00] and not that thy whole body should be
[23:01] cast into hell
[23:03] now look at this parable that he's
[23:04] saying
[23:05] if you knew just think about this if you
[23:08] knew
[23:09] that your right eye
[23:10] would keep you from the kingdom of
[23:12] heaven
[23:13] wouldn't you want to get rid of it
[23:15] if you really valued going to heaven you
[23:18] would want to get rid of it what if it
[23:20] was your what if it was your right hand
[23:22] or your left hand or your uh you and you
[23:24] knew
[23:25] first certainty
[23:27] that that would keep you from going to
[23:29] heaven you'd want to get rid of it
[23:30] wouldn't you
[23:31] so what's jesus saying he's saying get
[23:33] at the root of the problem
[23:35] don't don't hang on to the thing that's
[23:37] that's keeping you from going to heaven
[23:39] and say i can't lay this down
[23:41] he's not he's not requiring it because
[23:43] your right eye is not going to keep you
[23:44] from heaven and your right your right
[23:46] hand or whatever is not going to keep
[23:47] you from heaven but what will keep you
[23:49] from heaven is the old cankered heart
[23:52] so so just like he's saying don't don't
[23:54] uh value your body part if that is what
[23:57] would keep you from going to heaven
[23:59] don't hold back the thing
[24:01] from god that if it was changed would
[24:04] would allow you interest into heaven
[24:05] give your give your heart over to god
[24:08] allow him allow him to come in and take
[24:10] his abode in you
[24:12] in matthew chapter five is
[24:14] we've got just a few more minutes he
[24:16] said it has been said whosoever shall
[24:18] put his way as a wife
[24:20] let him give her a writing of
[24:21] divorcement
[24:23] but i say unto you
[24:25] he's look he's exposing the heart
[24:27] problem
[24:28] but you know in the old testament
[24:31] if uh let's see i got the scripture here
[24:33] i thought
[24:35] in deuteron i think it was deuteronomy
[24:37] 19.
[24:38] you could you could put away your wife
[24:41] for
[24:41] you just you just got displeased with
[24:43] her maybe maybe she got older and and
[24:46] you say well i i don't think she looks
[24:47] nice anymore she didn't fix my grits the
[24:49] way i wanted to be fixed or whatever it
[24:52] is and you could just put so so what's
[24:54] jesus exposing
[24:55] where is the love
[24:58] where's the love
[25:00] where's it's a heart problem
[25:02] because you know where when you're at
[25:04] rest
[25:05] there's not going to be any more
[25:06] divorces
[25:07] if god brings rest to a home and you're
[25:10] at rest down in your heart there's going
[25:12] to be a true an atmosphere of true love
[25:15] and you love one another and and you're
[25:18] willing to to do for one another and and
[25:20] uh
[25:21] and
[25:22] and all those things
[25:24] i'm trying to teach now i'm not
[25:26] you could preach this he said but i say
[25:28] unto you that whosoever shall put away
[25:30] his wife saving for the cause of foreign
[25:32] occasion
[25:34] causes her to commit adultery
[25:36] cause so he's exposing that see what
[25:39] you're doing if you put away your wife
[25:41] just because you're displeased with her
[25:43] and you look what you're causing her to
[25:45] do
[25:46] to commit adultery and whosoever shall
[25:48] marry her that is divorced committed
[25:50] committeth adultery
[25:54] and he said in in in verse 38 you have
[25:57] heard that it hath been said an eye for
[25:59] an eye
[26:00] and a tooth for a tooth
[26:02] but i say unto you that you resist not
[26:04] evil
[26:05] but whosoever shall smite thee on thy
[26:07] right cheek turn to him the other also
[26:11] and if any man will sue thee at the law
[26:14] and take away thy coat
[26:16] let him have thy cloak also
[26:18] and whosoever shall compel thee to go a
[26:21] mile go with him twain
[26:23] give to him that asketh thee and from
[26:25] him that would borrow of thee turn out
[26:26] thou away
[26:28] what's what's he saying he's saying we
[26:30] don't we don't yield from weakness just
[26:32] to the course of natural events but
[26:34] we
[26:36] if somebody does something wrong you
[26:37] don't withhold from them and say well
[26:39] it's my right
[26:40] but yet because you love one another you
[26:42] will and you're willing to let somebody
[26:44] not maybe not pay a debt back to you
[26:47] you're willing to suffer yourself as
[26:48] paul said to be defrauded
[26:51] because because your heart has been
[26:53] changed and the musicians can come
[26:55] forward and we'll we'll just stop on
[26:57] that why
[26:58] why are we laboring for rest because we
[27:01] need we need to there's something
[27:03] lacking in our lives
[27:05] we need the rest that only comes from
[27:07] the baptism of the holy ghost
[27:10] let's just go to the lord in prayer
[27:13] as we close
[27:15] god we thank you lord jesus for your
[27:16] grace to us lord and we just come
[27:18] expecting this this morning little god
[27:20] that you'll touch us and speak to every
[27:22] need lord and we just pray god at your
[27:24] lord help us to be receptive this
[27:26] morning and that you'll give brother
[27:27] matthew lord liberty to speak lord from
[27:30] his heart we pray we i just ask this
[27:32] blessing upon this service this morning
[27:33] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[27:35] amen
