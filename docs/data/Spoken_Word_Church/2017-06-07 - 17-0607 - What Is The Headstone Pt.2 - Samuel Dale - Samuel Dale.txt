========================================

good evening everybody so two Wednesday nights ago brother Terrence mention the request a praise report that we had about a tree that fell on our property and I wanted to give you the testimony than the pictures about that can y'all pull up the first slide please so because what happened was actually very supernatural so it's over the last 10 years gee that's can y'all see that you dim a couple of lights maybe four please so ten years ago Gabby now got married and moved into this little house that we live in and we've been keeping around on that big Hickory tree because it's enormous and because of that little hollow place there at the bottom of the tree but it wasn't any real reason to be concerned right off just because it was a still great live tree very strong now I can't see further way next slide please in March of this year though there came a big wind in the storm and the like a tornado force wind just for about five seconds it's not like a locomotive in our backyard and and we started seeking shelter and then all at once it stopped went out the next day and looked and there was now a big crack in addition to her hollow place down the side of the tree about the first 12 feet of that trunk so we started calling around and thinking you know now it's time to have the tree removed so we called several tree companies go back one side please and what we're just going to do is have them cut the limbs off the top of the tree that would remove the threat so it couldn't reach our house maybe 500 bucks is what I was thinking well they said two to four thousand dollars because they're gonna have to bring in heavy equipment so I said no thank you so they're looking into ways of doing it myself which is somewhat irrational because it'd be very dangerous but anyway in the meantime go to the next slide please just so you know what these are also temporarily as a measure to keep try to keep it from falling our house secured it to two other adjacent trees with log change but that really wouldn't keep it off our house permanently that was just in the meantime till I could get something done all right next slide so here's the setup we've got next slide next slide there's so our house here this is on the back edge of our property can anybody see that okay so our house here oh that's bare neighbor's house here other neighbor's house here our utility building us here barn down there so the tree is surrounded by about five structures so any way it would fall in that direction it would desecrate whatever it would land on because a very lively very heavy full of moisture tree so it would be very damaging I'll stand there all I was doing wasn't thing about the scripture I was standing about in this spot where this picture was taken from looking up at it studying and thinking now what can I do to take this down without hurting myself and all of a sudden the scripture came to my mind where Jesus said Luke 17 6 if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed you shall say to this I thing said sick of entry be thou plucked up by the root and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you so I looked up at the tree and I thought now I can't fall anywhere over this way without doing damage but back on this side is a dilapidated chain-link fence it belongs to an adjacent commercial property already falling in they don't care about the fence evidently so I said to that tree I just looked up in a quiet voice I said when you fall fall this way I didn't shout I was an anointed I wasn't like anything great God hides in such simplicity that sometimes it can be working through you and you not even know it okay God is really incredible in hiding in simplicity and so much to where you won't even realize when he's working through you well that was back in March or so and I went on and forgot about it now I should also mention that on this side of the tree facing our house most of the limbs are on that side and I'm not talking that little limb some of these limbs are the side of a small tree themselves and some of them shoot 20 or 30 feet out over our yard so all the weight from that side of the tree if you stand here and look up it's got about a four or five degree lean toward our house and then the hollow place in the correct place on that side of the tree so everything every rational thought would tell you that that tree is going to fall on that house okay but I didn't stand there and rationalize about it those things didn't come into my mind I just simply looked up and said when you fall fall this way you know there's a thing in the military I've never been in the military but heard this quote that I like a soldier's duty is not to reason why a soldier's duty is to do or die be desperate or perish but just simply obey what you've been told to do no matter how irrational it seems and the scripture plainly said you just didn't say wood the tree lean that way or make it follow the way it's you know won't to fall in anyway he just said speak to this tree that's it we had a legitimate need we just needed it not fall in our house which wasn't meat temps in God I wasn't testing to see what I could do so next slide please at the same time this was going on I didn't realize this but Gabby was inside the house during the same about the same time telling our kids they said mommy isn't going to fall in our house they said and she said to them no this tree is going to be like Goliath you know in the story of David and Goliath he was struck in the front but he fell forward he should have fallen backward but I believe God had him fall for it because he was defying God the boss says every knee shall bow you know if you defy God he'll bring you to your knees and bring you down and the fact is Goliath forward when he should have fell backwards so Gaby was telling the girls no baby that tree is going to fall backwards the weight was on the phone it researched assault should fall forward she said no it's going to fall backwards so she was making that confession and I was speaking to the tree and we didn't know that either one of us was doing that no but the veil told us to read the message of grace about a week ago I was reading to that about my third time reading that and I've never caught this before sure y'all knew this but this is the second time that brother venomous poke squirrels into existence I always thought it was just that one time but he says I thought right here's where God gave me them squirrels last year to speak into existence took off my hat again and said Lord God you're still the same Jesus you're still some said to me how many do you need this time I said this to the other times limit and then I said I shall have this limit before 10 o'clock today in strangers it seems just then there was a very bad mosquito area grows infested with mosquitoes and kind of a swampland and the great big mosquito came to bite me right by my eye and I said not one of them will bother me this day so speaking the nature and then he went on to say before I knew it and he said the Sun will shine within 30 minutes so brother Brennan speaking to nature three times he's commanded nature and if you read on all three of those things came to pass the squirrels came to existence the mosquitoes went away and the Sun came out so what's happening here Jesus said the meek shall inherit the earth right this is there's a position we're coming to and I believe this is leading up to that now the next slide please this shows you that tree towering over our house it dwarfs the other trees in our backyard it's this middle one right here that's our Goliath okay and this is our little teeny-weeny house and just before I forget to say if the tree were to fall this way we later measure the tree and found out where it would land the top of the tree would be on my Nissan Frontier in our front yard it would have engulfed our house there was another storm that came - Tuesday nights ago 10:30 at night that tree fell now there's only one tree in our neighborhood that we know of that fell there was a lot of wind in a lot of areas I think a lot of damage in North Georgia evergreen street had a tough time there was a lot of trees fell on Green Street but in our neighborhood there's only one tree that we know of it fell very odd the way this happened but that night the girls are already in beds they weren't stomping and running around making noise so there's no reason we should have not heard that tree fall see buddy ever heard of tree fall it's very violent and very awesome it takes down the tops of other trees with it it brings down whole other trees with it and breaks off the limbs of other trees it grabs everything grab on the way down the the the trunk will pop and crack and twist and torque and then finally when it hits the ground it makes a loud thud and you can feel it and your insides shaking if you're within 100 feet of it well none of that okay the girlfriend bed is sleep I was on this end of the house gabi now I was off work that week so I was at home Gabby and I were doing our quiet time on opposite ends of the house I was reading so I was well able to hear the storm and she was on this end but in the back bedroom the most vulnerable position to be in if that tree should fall in the house and she was listening to brother Bob I think in one year she always keeps one ear open she has a hair bud in one ear and she keeps other ear open to hear kids because they get it so we were both able to hear the storm there wasn't a lot of wind at our house it was done but not a lot and then you know just heavy rain and thunder and lightning all of a sudden we heard a pinging sound on the back of her house sounded like little pieces of bark or debris hitting the back of our house where that thing snapped and then we heard Gabby said she heard a few limbs breaking so we ran to the back window and looked thinking that maybe some limbs fell off the tree pitch-black dark about that time to light and lit up the sky and we saw this huge void go to the next slide we saw this great big void where that tree used to stand and it fell exactly where we told it to fall down to the inch exactly the opposite way from our house and I'm telling you I don't know how much wind it would take to make it do that but to overcome the leverage of all those limbs and to write the tree in the first place because it was leaning and bend it backward like that make it fall back had to have taken a lot of wind but there wasn't so next slide go back one go back to this previous slide I'm sorry we measured that next one in the length of the tree to be 95 feet we measured it twice we just walk down the length of the trunk on into that neighbor property nothing over there by the way there's a commercial storage building place down here but nothing else for it to hurt it didn't hurt anything except that fence back there 95 feet and we measured from the stump back this way to our house 60 68 feet so it would have completely consumed our home then now the next slide the closest thing came to is that little cheap metal building of ours real thin metal it came within inches of that just a big piece of the of the Barton splintered off of there thanks slide I'm not a good photographer this the best I could do about getting a side view but basically this is only like the first 10 feet of the tree so with your imagination flip that over this way and then add another 85 feet going out that way toward our little house next slide this is just a before and after shot of the life that's before he fell standing nice and strong and then after he fell and there's a little Pentecostal kid dancing in our front yard either because it was the last day of school or because the tree fell next on just a closer up view of the same thing and then the last one is a picture of my mom she came to claim the firewood for the next several winters she's got a fireplace so we're going to try to cut it up and haul it to her house but uh the most amazing thing about this is if you look back to the last sermon that was preached here before that happened it was on May 21st the tree fell on May 23rd May 21st for the wave the second sermon that day he preached the fall and he preached about the title deed he was talking a lot about these things about us coming back to the position that Adam was in before the fall having dominion with fishes in the final the air and so forth not a coincidence jesus said the meek shall inherit the earth and you know what's amazing too about this is I'm not standing here to toot mine and Gabby's horn and say we did anything I'm saying all of y'all have done this before y'all y'all spoken to storms whether spiritual or natural and move things in your own life you know just don't overlook those things cuz god hiding simplicity if you really think you'll realize that God was there working through you and just remember the things because what God wants to forget when he does something it's for purpose you know thank y'all so much for the time raise the lord is he still God amen I appreciate that testimony but Ron I think we all do that all things are possible to them that believe you know butter on I just appreciate their testimony and he's quiet they're just quiet but

you'd like to turn in your scriptures tonight and read along with us we'll go to Joe - and then we'll go to Malachi for Joe to Malachi for remember to be much inquiring for a way to be traveling up to New Mexico and doing others are traveling and different things and being with them the black family they're traveling to the different things and on and just pray the Lord would bless and we're sorry

a good time we always do we we never go hungry so we fellowship together everything but just make sure you know to do but make sure we'll have a little meeting maybe something but make sure you bring

we've got to go up and check on it because they say the wind has blowed down a lot of trees in that area but we're going up to see if you may have to come in from the low what called low gap and but we will find a place it won't matter with find somewhere to stay for a couple of days and praise the Lord and have a good time alright Joel - and Melancon for the Heavenly Father we thank you for this day and your loving your grace thank you for the testimony from brother Ryan about the tree Lord because we believe it we know truly this it takes you to bring things to pace in our lives and or we just don't want to forget it we want to recognize it and give you the honor and glory for everything father we we praise your great name and we thank you we just ask you to have your way with each one of us and guide us in your understanding and keep us in Jesus name Amen I was thinking while brother Ryan was telling the testimony about the tree and I was leaning but thinking about back in the times you remember when they were killing the Christians and vines and I forgot what age it was in but you remember the story that was told that he said tommy's of the tree on the bottom side he said this time neither and said if I'm God you'll see so the tree was leaning they tied him on the bottom side which is supposed to go they cut the tree and tree fell back up and killed the ones that was and didn't bother the man so I still believe God is real don't you ok Joe - we're very familiar Scripture with us and we'll try to get back into some of this you know to do but says be glad then you children of Zion and rejoicing the Lord your God for yet giving you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month now you remember back anyways bring it it's the only time it talks about it falling together alright and the floor shall be full of wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and all and I will restore to you the years at the locusts have eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar and the pommel worm my great army which I sent among youth and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God ready yet done all right and it goes on bringing the other to go over now to Malachi very familiar scripture with all of us and I'd like to read verse 4 because remember Melek hides the last book of the Old Testament all right now the lice wordings God is giving to the Old Testament alright life's book of the Old Testament the last chapter the Old Testament the last few verses of the Old Testament the reason I like to read verse for me and talks about all the other you'll tread then the ashes of the wickedness thing but said remember you the law of Moses my servant you're ending the Old Testament and God's reminding you to remember because remember who brought the word of the Lord through the Old Testament remember you the law of Moses my servant which I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel and with the statutes and judgments behold I will send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming the Great and dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart singular notice of the father's to the children and the heart of the children through your father's let's not come in from out to earth with a curse you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now I know we won't get to it but I want your thinking to be connected to where we preached two weekends ago and enjoy brother the cash having them with us for the weekend and all it gives you arrest but it helps and everybody you know can can listen and and follow along in maybe his way of bringing things coach you know that's what we believe in but now what was we talking about what have we been talking about for about three services we've been talking about that the children of Israel they rejected the headstone to them because when Jesus Christ come riding into Jerusalem he was the headstone all right and they rejected him crucified him and everything in it it turned out that all of those Old Testament Scriptures who he brought through the Psalms and the things where it was promised that that stone would come all right and that stone is not a rock it's not something like that it's a revelation it's a person Israel rejected the person of the Lord Jesus Christ as being the great eternal God right and they crucified him see then the scripture said that they rejected him and said that stone was a stone of stumbling coming into the New Testament using the wording and a rock of offense and those people actually the people that claim to be the people of God and they were the chosen alike all right everything was okay until they rejected the Messiah now once they did that then that stone that revelation you remember what the scriptures are and Matthew were that that Jesus read who to man say I the son of my name and they said dark the Christ the Son of the Living God then he said to Peter upon this rock I'll build my church now that robbed are as a revelation of Jesus Christ it's not on Peter the Baptist the Methodists and the things like that when a claim is on that and the Catholic wants to claim its own Peter no he didn't say that he said upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail all right it's a revelation of Jesus Christ once they turn God down that was their Messiah right if they reject his sonship and they will never come back as sons and daughters of the Living God as the bride are a sonship they rejected that even 144,000 you go over the revelations they'll come back to be servants they they won't come back because they rejected that part and that's what I've kept asking you and I are cautioning us could we turn down the revelation of Jesus Christ in our day and miss it oh no we believe everything well you know what if you to ask them what they believe they would have told you they believed everything they would have told you that they were looking for a messiah they'll tell you today they're looking for a messiah and they'll tell you that Messiah will be God in human flesh upon the earth we'll see then when they rejected Jesus Christ they lost all rights the Bible says adoption was to Israel the Oracles which is the word of God it came to Israel all of them when they turned it down this reason I would like to reverse forward our Malachi because he's telling you to remember what Moses said remember the law Moses the Word of God right is the the law is that the Word of God the Ten Commandments that's the Word of God that was God in letter form not a bunch of rules to keep that's where we don't understand we think it's something we can do or not do no it wasn't that it was a person they rejected from being their Messiah their God turning that down and when they did he became then as we read in the scripture on those and we can he can pull that up he'd like to but in first Peter it turns out to saying I'll lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone where was that laid out it was rejected by the Old Testament it was laid in the early church on the death pendant the disciples had walked with the Lord Jesus for three and a half years he had taught them the things of the coming kingdom and all of the things that would take place and how he would have to die and you have to give his life of course they didn't understand that that's oh no no then we won't let that out and Peter tried his best to fight for him over in the garden you know whoever grabbed a sword cut off when the high priest guards here you know but see he became the chief Cornerstone he became the cornerstone to the church because that's what Jesus said to Peter he said thou art Peter and upon this rock not him revelation it was it goes on to tell it right the revelation of Jesus Christ alright then we go into the scripture we kept on bringing that out in in Ephesians 2 and 20 how that we're built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ being a chief corner stone to you and I today are build upon what those disciples told that's when he said to Peter upon this rock I'll build my church upon this revelation Peter of who I am and who was he use either Almighty God in human flesh are we're the most deceived people in the world oh he's a second person of the Trinity show me the word Trinity in the Bible anyone kind of like a men it worked one time and I'm talking to him about water baptism because we firmly believes and water baptism according to Matthew 28:19 no it says in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I don't we read Father Son and Holy Ghost with father son Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ that's sensible he said to baptize in the night but I talking to a man about baptism and I said you realize that early church I said I can show you in your own encyclopedia were that the Catholic Church changed the mood of baptism and let it father son Holy Ghost and I said that early church baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said that's right okay I got shotting talk today but actually finish the rest of the sentence I don't think because I walked away cuz you know what he's saying he said that early church was Trinitarians now I'm not joking it's what the man said and he said then being Trinitarians they had to be baptized name the Lord Jesus Christ to get him back to one God but said now we baptize father son Holy Ghost call we know who he is and I said so long buddy because anybody would be that carnal to think the early church would be baptized and wrong and the Catholic Church would be baptizing right but it's the way we are anyway we do but listen now Joel try to get into the point jaws that I will restore yours of the cankerworm Palma worm locust the caterpillar now if you read you Bible you know if you're a sensible as a farmer you know that that's four stages of one bug right cankerworm pom worm locust caterpillar as one thing this went through all the cocoons went through all of the changes and turned out it's the same bug because what is Satan showing you what has happened all right and down to the ages we see on the debt Pentecost that they started off with the faith of the fathers the one true Living God how many God did Israel of old house that's why they would kill you if you say anything about a Trinity now because they're not Trinitarians they believe in one true and living God if you asked him about Messiah he will be almighty God because they believe the Scriptures they just don't see it and see then believing it that way then we know that what happened during the ages from the time of Paul and Peter in them coming down through time that's what joel is speaking of because he's speaking of where that old cankerworm pom worm locust caterpillar and all started at the same bug eating it to church you know what would happen to a tree go back and study a little you take a tree and you got a tree and it's got bark it's got leaves it's got this and you go back and think about how that one of those bugs takes the leaves off one of those bug takes some fruit off one of those bug takes the bark off one of them goes and gets the SAP of the tree same old bug that's what Catholicism has done to the church and it went down in state as a true word it was eating away in the church and bringing it but the true word life stood about the first for ages and you get Martin the new at Columba you get meeting like that when Martin st. Martin he would there was great signs and wonders fathered to them the sick healed to d'etre is all kind of things in every service it says about him if you studied your history weighed it ate it down not trying to get a face run through it ate it down until it was really just down to a stump but God said I will restore those things so what did you do he took a man named Martin Luther and he preached the message of the judge shall live by faith and it started a worldwide revival bringing back the life the Congress for messengers of death took it down can one farm or local scatter field for messengers are life's going to bring back Luther Wesley Pentecost and in the word that's why we don't deny any churches in their teaching everybody thanks we're so much against this that or the other I believe what Martin Luther told her to just you live by faith but now I don't believe the other things he told it was not correct I certainly wouldn't agree with Martin Luther said to order take the juice out and kill them because they crucified Jesus crying she things like that is back to that wouldn't be right but now you take the Lutheran Church today and compare it to Martin Luther Wright you take the Methodist Church today and compare it to John Wesley and was teaching when John Wesley said there was no need to even drinking black coffee because there was nothing within it those people were the Word of God for the Iowa right Martin Luther preached the just shall live by faith John Wesley come along you get men many buildings put in there between you bring in the Baptist and then we're bringing back baptism buddy mercy we're still kept it Father Son Holy Ghost because the Catholic Church is one in ordain didn't brother but John Wesley brought the truth of sanctification he's in Azusa Street 1906 what we call Pentecostals started a worldwide revival over the guilts and the understanding of the Godhead and the bringing forth of the truth the one true and living God coming back my because God promised it alright but now you got to bring it to the word because the word was what was the eating them so the cane corn pronghorn locust caterpillar for bugs then we come over on those I to Martin Luther see preaching and just you live that's the truth he's one of the church eggs messengers come on get into your Bible and study oh no it's not written in Nara blue turban but just read just history of the age in the time read the message to the age and you'll see that those people with are alright see then it comes back there's got to be the word to be restored alright so now listen when I'm calm I didn't draw said I will restore well the promise is to be restored back what to the word of the Living God and the presence of Almighty God among his church and as that began to be brought forth me the promises dinner the Bible picks up and see that's why we then read Malachi 4 Joe tells you it's going to happen right God is going to restore Malachi tells you how it's going to happen behold I send you Elijah the prophet and he turned the hearts of the children see the fathers fathers to the children we know the scriptures and we were able to place them together see God is promised in his word the five times of the coming of the spirit of Elijah you remember Elijah come forth with the word for the hour Elijah done for miracles read your Bible go back studying Elijah said to Elisha before he passed you remember he was going over and he throw the mantle back to him he said give me a double portion of your spirit he said if you see me go you'll get it so he didn't let him get away he stayed right with him didn't he and Elijah come forth with the spirit of Elijah or alas as the Bible called and when it did he comes forth with that truth Elijah does eight miracles a double portion John the Baptist the Bible said he came in the spirit and power of Elijah Richard Bible he came to fulfill what Isaiah 42 witness right I know it's right into 40 41 42 that John the Baptist come to brain season in the end time that's got to come back because John turned the people from the Old Testament introducing Jesus Christ right and he turned them from the Old Testament and that's why I read Malachi 4 and verse 4 because remember the law of Moses John turned them by pointing to Jesus Christ and saying behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world he turned them to that new message comes I stood the new message that stood the cornerstone I stood the headstone that stood every time because it was Jesus Christ right and what we say we know that was we'll get to some things later but I'll listen and see we think that mccullen look 1:17 he said he'll turn the hearts of the other if we think John turned them backward he turning back under the law you mean he turned them to the faith and turn them back away from it meaning reading scripture it said that they would have to come one and Elijah would be sent in the last days before the burning or else it comes from unto earth with a curse so the forth coming of Elijah had to come in our day to bring us the message received in the felt time it will be in through one of the two witnesses to Israel because it would be Moses and Elijah going to Israel all right are you with me them to follow there's got to be a restoration back to the faith of the Father now ever born again believer I'm trying to make this point so if I don't get into message don't worry I got to preach next two or three services waves going video ever born-again believer is born again at faith that's why Peter over in 2nd Peter II says to those of like precious faith every person enters the pyramid the same at faith we said faith is a revelation revelation is the new birth faith according to Hebrew said what faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen you can't be born again without having faith because faith is a revelation to you of who Jesus Christ is what is the new birth then a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you it doesn't matter where it would be the days of Martin Luther or whether it would be any of these everybody entered the pyramid of faith but the disciples had been taught for three and I years right and when they did today they were born again was not just to put him at faith it put them right here where it said Holy Spirit so we're built on the foundation apostles and prophets Jesus Christ being the chief Cornerstone now come on not take out second Peter take out second Peter if you don't believe it totally you said what do you mean I'm seeing what Peter Peter standing there he said with them of like precious faith the prophet of God said what this is written to the church this is not to the world every born-again believer starts at faith that's why you got to split condition on the Deaf Pentecost you got the 120 in the upper room that were tutored and trained by the Lord Jesus for three and a half years I'm not saying every one of the hundred twenty with our just don't don't get all caught up with any philosophies just listen with that group of people we're born again and when he did God put them right here how's your faith and fathers if not what you're going to restore are you going to agree that Martin Luther had the new birth if you're not you might as well pack up and go home because you ain't even in the story you said you shouldn't don't like why not did Martin Luther house the new birth oh it was just a just a little bit but it was the new birth you can't put what is the new birth justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost but look at them never taught it like that no what they come through it you say well now how do you prove that okay I ain't going to argue I'm just going like a statement go on now how many of you sisters and had a baby water blood and life now did any of you ever bypass any of those stages and we're talking about normal birth we talk about caesarean but caesarean still gets the water blood and a lot okay so don't jump up and get all smart etiquette it's be sensible so you can't say that those people didn't have a new work they had the new birth for the word of the hour was birth within them because that's the restoration I know the story I know Martin Luther come out to be and turned out to be a Reformation right on Wesleyan went on the end of Reclamation but it had to start with restoration you won't run around them when he says it Azusa Street turned out to be Reformation and you got to admit they got to baptise for the Holy Ghost cuz the Bible says and he does too but listen trying to get you to think about we're at what we're doing so then Joe tells you it's going to happen now that's why I like things in the Word of God I love to be able to put it in the Word of God and say well Joe said this is going to happen then God comes along and he don't leave it that away he comes alone he puts Malachi in and he tells you how it's going to happen it's going to happen by sending Elijah the Prophet to bring the enzyme message and to turn us back to the face of the Father but remember what it says in Malachi he turned the hearts of the Old Testament to the New Testament message right John introduced Jesus Christ bringing new testament a-c-c then somebody's got to come to turn our hearts back to the original up Aroon experience because remember what I was saying 120 in the Upper Room you see that new but at a higher form than the others because they had the word but the 3000 outside it heard one sermon right you can't put them up in the pyramid other than faith I'll try to explain that for over 40 years and people just look at you like who let's hear you explain I don't mean that sarcastically I mean the truth to show me how this thing to come out of the end to where it can be finished up it's promised that the faith of the fathers would be restored right and that it would come to a place to word it would be built upon the same rock the same revelation of the Apostles now you know yourself that the church world don't teach what Paul taught now right is that sensible like I said about the water baptism I can't even get it straight when Peter we're riding it and Matthew come forth and put it in the pen and the one little thing of water baptism you shall be one person in the Bible that was ever baptized father son Holy Ghost are you in me show me one person in the Bible they were baptized father son holy go I'll write you it I mean baptized tell me any word that anybody ever baptized father son Holy Ghost until the Catholic Church come along starting at 325 AD for 606 show me anybody they were baptizing them the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you show me anybody in the Bible it was baptized father son holy go and I'll give you a check for $10,000 you're welcome that's how sure the Word of God is oh you'll come along and say philosophies of this right let's forget it any time like that you shall be in the Bible we go to the Bible we read the Bible we don't read histories and I when I history will verify where it came from and how it developed see what I'm trying to get them across is what I tried to get across in three messages we can be a blind as a bat and set in claiming I'm in the word what about the doctrines and things of this message and how they took one message and split it all into every kind of thing with all kind of doctrines even saying that Jesus wouldn't God until the River Jordan and then he finally become God now quote your prophet if that wasn't God where we no need a fooling with nothing else but listen upon this rock Matthew 16 says I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against what about the wonderful things of doing like I said now watch the point and follow me through the night I'll just get a little bit and then go John tells you what's going to happen Malachi tells you how it's going yeah but he don't stop there see it comes down to our day in our time to understand you get the illustration Malachi tells you how it will be done John the Baptist would come and turn the hearts of the people of the Old Testament to the New Testament message and a lot of those disciples is the Lord Jesus coming over John's convert right those easily one that introduced the Messiah but then somebody's got to come and turn that back to the faith of the Father because you tell me that these churches today is believing in the face of us unless this I don't even preach out there let's preach the message you know what I mean let's stay here you don't need them going off on nobody I'll show with our let's stay here and talk about it let's stay here on the internet and the things and talk about it show me in this message where the people are staying when Hebrews 13:8 that he's the same yesterday today and forever tell me where they're believing it the Prophet brought the message to turn us back oh they'll tell you he come and swept off the foundation and we're got to build the rest of it who's gonna bring forward the hitch time remember the headstone was so rejected until all that could be in the Bride of Christ on the day of Pentecost was a cornerstone right why because the headstone was rejected Jesus Christ was either Almighty God or the biggest deceiver the world has ever had I don't mind statement anyway they must have thought he thought he was God they killed him cause he said he was God right they must've thought he thought it was God that's reason they killed him all right but now listen you know what I'm doing I'm having to bring down and open up a few things and the can of beans to where we can move on right so bear with me all right I've never been like what a lot of preachers a lot of preachers get up here they're going to preach what they gonna preach it don't matter who's sitting in the building no matter where anybody in the building even those anything about what they gonna preach they gonna preach that straight line when the Holy Ghost don't do that I'm just telling you don't do it so I don't worry about it well I've got to let me do it it makes me back up pick up try to do the best I can to help everybody give it understanding and you know what I found out a long time I found out by backing up and going over time that the old ones wasn't getting it with ones the new ones were setting out of saying amen may I I'll do it myself I've been at it 40-something years I don't have to worry about it I mean on that for 40-something years do you try to preach to the old heads of these people of this message is where you get snarled up at oh I don't know who does he think he is well who are you no problem I just made what listen like I said I like to see things in the word then take the word as further advancement and then come out with the end time to where the message compares to all of them scriptures do you understand one of these days you'll understand what I used to do I don't do it as much now because I'm anchored into it all of those that was sitting in the Bible study Saturday heard a statement out of me that you wouldn't hear out of most preachers God used to give me things I'd spend thirty minutes writing a sermon and spending three hours trying to tear it down because if I could tear it down it wasn't right that's why when I preach I'm open like a book that's being what you want to I am what I am that's the best way I can be all right but listen now do you see what I'm talking about Joe says it's going to happen Malachi tells you how it's going to happen and God sends Elijah the Prophet right to turn the hearts of the children then back to the Pentecostal father's so now let's read that one go ahead brother number three a very familiar one with us then you see in church age and it's messenger Malachi 4 and Luke 17 I mean revelation Malachi 4 in Revelations 10 7 you can put Luke 17 dirty in there easily that's no problem right it's going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 you turn the hearts of the children to the father's now that's what I just went through showing you Joel says it's got to be done because it went down and it's got to be restored Malachi shows you what's going to happen how it's going to turn back and here is the number three stay each of the profit verifying the Scriptures so when you mouth of two or three witness to say these things mouth of two or three witnesses this sealed up you can do what you want good you say life's don't believe it your way with us if yourself is it what the word says if it does argue with the one who wrote it one according to Malachi 4 you turn the hearts of the children to the father and this is what I love because that just leave you to where you could say well does this turn this or that turn no god finishes it to the mouth of the Prophet right number two one thing he's going to turn the hearts of the children to the father's back to the Old Testament I mean back to the Apostles doctrine which is what I said we're built on the foundation apostles and prophets I was setting our life in the day because there's a Sunday when I was preaching I was watching that message and I was preaching away how did Zachariah was going to build a building I figured somebody saves a ruble in a minute they didn't say it but I wouldn't think you know it then but you don't want Zack arrives when it wrote it Zachariah wasn't one didn't told truble the words of the Lord I just like looking ok this is I just old age ok so late the two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelation contained in the seven seals so you see we're not looking for another prophet to come or another messenger to rise and all of that it's done been done look it will be these divinely revealed mystery true the seals is the only way the statue of a perfect man can be built you can't turn to the face of the father's dr. seals coming first he just said it would be these divinely real mystery troops that literally turned the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal father's that's why I brought around them come forth priest the message and had to pass on but he preached the message so we're not looking for another messenger no we're looking to the Word of God so you see number three Joel said it would take place Malachi tells you how it's going to happen if God is going to send this messenger and then this messenger that comes backs up and tells you that's exactly what will take place now some of you flip a little bit on the head out of the church age book remember the church age book never came out to laughter the seals broke so there's things in that church age book that everybody fights against I love it they fight against it but there was things he said in there that will flabbergast you if you really think about it because God put that in there to be said that away where the people could argue over what is what do you understand what I'm getting at how is it that we could be turned back to the face of the father's not God bringing his message seals and everything marriage aboard all a whole that's enticing on and then leaving it into our hands you know like this and what he left at the FIFO ministries and now you sort of own that once all right that's where he left it because he said they break it down I wouldn't want to send him times and you got to argue ahem what do you say one two three one two three one two an hour think about it the early church we've covered it started out with the faith of the fathers now to show you that it's the faith of the fathers and the way it goes I'll make one statement to you I never use the novice to write the word right come on I'm not saying anything wrong with that 3000 outside or anything unto death Pentecost we take one thing about it he didn't use them to write the word he used the ones that were in the word who brought the word and brought the revelation you get over to Peter and look at what Peter dude Peter's looking at the early church and he's saying these people needs to know how to get where we're at brothers so he preaches the statue of a perfect man as we come and your faith virtue knowledge temperately bringing you back to the faith of the father just because you're born again by the new bird that only puts you in the body of Christ where everybody is put there by the new birth but the growth development becomes because of the words you hear so now it's exactly right then the Prophet brought the message went on all to see we got the message how are we going to be turned back to the faith of the fathers well I just need patience writers how patient tribulation worketh patience that's not exactly what's being said if it is we'll just line up and start beating each other to death that's not tribulation anyway it's the opening of God's word that turns a church back to the face of the father's are you following me the opening of God's Word what if it probably had to come to tell us this time you realize that six that revelation was lost from mankind of the second Peter in the eighth of the fathers in the Statue of a perfect man nobody was teaching at until the profit came on the scene and he said he preached 30-something years before he could preach that you reached out to a perfect land see if he did sure he know things new things up and down through that but uh it's kind of odd that he said he just read he said I just got this the other day where this fits in on something like want the truck he's talking about second Peter add to your faith virtue knowledge right you see Church the message had been delivered into our hands but what are we going to do with it what are we going to do so then we know and see that we need Joel says it Malachi tells you how the Prophet verifies it that's the way it's going to take place let's take another little illustration I know we'll give it this much tonight so we'll do this we know for a certainty of just a statement to where you get started even at the faith of the fathers of the Apostles the headstone had not come in because it was rejected I'll show you what was rejected Jesus preached in matthew 24:6 seals none of the Apostles knew anything about show me any writing of any apostle other than Matthew Mark Luke and John as a recorder of the situation showed me even Paul mixing me shut up man come on give me a buffalo I'm open show me any of them talking of son of man but what about a little profit walk out there in the earliest we've got his 47 and I think I looked it up when diamonds either 48 or 49 he started talking about sort of plan could it leave that was a revelation that was missing and worried about it but I know it's truly a boy's mission that's why they couldn't follow Frodo random in his ministry he would talk about the Word of God and how it would be standing there and it would show and reveal and be done and and the signs would go with it I got one written over here later I'll get to it but I want to say this to you let me just hit my mind you know what read around says Luke 1730's assigned he said Malachi 4 is the voice that's in the message portion design melikhaya is the lawyers Luke 1730 was the sign of the Son of Man which is the resurrection sign Malachi 4 is the voice in the days of the voice of the seventh angel Melek are saying what behold I send you Elijah the pride in he'll bring this word to you to the church in the church being able to receive let's take another situation just for a minute I know this will probably basically finish it so we'll hold the notes until Sunday and preach on okay let's read another scripture and let's see if it follows the same pattern as we've been using that a scripture declares something is going to take place you go on over into the word and it will unfold into deeper things then the prophet will come and give us the correct understanding come on you maybe never talk to anybody about millicom over in Luke 17 30 very much to understand this one you ever talk to him about my look how forward and they said John the Baptist Luke 1:17 they knew it cuz scripture said he turn the hearts of the joy in that it's obedient unto the kind of and said they could see he turned at this waiting he turned it right back well that turn of the Old Testament to the Uni coming right back no and your prophet said that to do so but listen go ahead with number number forward I want to bring in to you one thing that is astounding to me very wonderful piece of little machinery that goes in the Word of God do you know now say this it was the first one who come up with the point of restoring the temple and don't start jump into his rule and try to figure it out just listen go to Ezra they don't have to put it up who was it in Ezra one and one who first talked about restoring the temple Israel one and one now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia that the word of the lord by the mouth of jeremiah might be fulfilled the lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia then he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing so you'll find it in chronicles if you look in your Bible I'm reading from Ezra back up three verses in chronicles and he told you the same time thus says Cyrus king of Persia and I love to hiss he thank the bottle later right when he said I put in King I take out king look what this King says the Lord God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth turning Ezra if you want to read it and they got it up here okay kind of here thus says Cyrus king of Persia the Lord God in heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem which is in Judah he's charged me a he turn King and he said who is there among all of his people he is God be with him and let him walk to Jerusalem which is in Judah and build the house of the Lord God of Israel he is the God which is in Jerusalem read on through you'll find out that he emptied all of his treasures he paid for the temple to be restored he emptied all of his treasures to pay for it even gave them back the vessels that Babylon had taken in the captivity with Jerusalem I mean that's Bible Ricci Baba the healer and King is recalling saying God laid on my heart to build him a house in God did it and he supplied the material okay it ought to be number one remember number one was your promise in the restoration snackin was America third was brought a random explaining it so there's number one the King tell them the building now let's go to Shaka brah let's read a little bit and Zach a rifle and the angel that talked with me came again to wake me the man as a man that is awakened out of his sleep and said unto me what see us now not who get him down here a little bit but you know what happened when when there in Israel that it was required to do it they wrote her to wrote a whole bunch of them eggs like I forgot seven or eight thousand of the people known always way under two hundred seven thousand all the children of Israel went up to build that temple it's removable was the leader he was the governor he was the leader a look he sent him to me what she is down I said I have looked and behold a camera stick all of gold with a bold upon the top of it any seven lamps their own in seven pipes to the seven lamps which are on the top thereof and two olive trees by it went up on the right side of the boat and the other from the left side so I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord now listen we just look at it and we want to run down to the rubble in the parks now we should read that I've asked you to to read it I emphasize Zachariah for to read it I roll it back down brethren let's just say something what about from here here three verses he covers the entire journey of mankind all the way 144,000 and the two witnesses it's not playing folks you don't read like that maybe it's not meant for you to read but at least you're to read behind me look ain't going to talk when they came and wake me and when I said unto to watch the Istana said I have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold revelation seven golden candlesticks right then the bowls on either side and the vault upon the top of it remember seven lamps are owned and selling pipes to the seven left we jump on the table there and two olive trees now where you won't jump ahead I'll go ahead and say it the two olive trees first number one is the old and new Testament right that's why you don't want to run it with the book of Revelation and make it just the two businesses you got to give them to it insist something to say the old and the new testament now i'm quote rotor Branham on that and that's been part of here if that's the old in the New Testament the two olive trees but then when it comes to finality the two olive trees wind up to be the two prophets to Israel follow me and listen the two olive trees I know they don't up now the angel that talk when the answer in the Senate to me no it's not now not what these be and I should know my lord any incidence back unto me saying this is the word this up here is a description of what will happen through time who show the very beginning over to the very ending time you know it's all about the two witnesses is the lies we have time matter then we know that well we only have earthly journey picking those up and taking them into the millennium listen what is this did you sing well I saw seven golden candlesticks and I saw two angels and I saw two lampstands and that's all this when the Prophet said well remember in Bible study other night we were talking about you know that Moses went up into heaven and got the pattern and come back built the temple that right now what did Moses see in heaven a temple or a person he's I hope we'll see you're not listening Moses saw Jesus Christ and came back to earth and could not put it in words what he saw so he put it in stone don't you think he was standing there watching them somebody move aboard and started doing these old it holding what Moses you see this up never know but that don't fit the rest there's temple so you're not bringing out what I'm talking about that's just money okay the answer to take this is the word of the Lord unto rouble saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit says the Lord of Hosts that's all of this summed up in that many words then look at those words as they finish go art Thou O great mountain before zerubabbel I shall become a flame and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace into it who's going to bring the headstone the ruble no one said who are no great mountain for drew but I said come to play and he she'll bring forward you said well that's Jesus okay fine no problem we got it this right but this is a rule because there was a man's rule building a literal temple so you had to have the literal to be able to have the spiritual come on read your Bible sometime but he says and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof why didn't it say he's folks for praying the cornerstone let me asking you the question why didn't it say he shall bring forth corn we're going to read down here it does tell it to lay the foundation then we're going to read read around with what he says okay moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of Giroud will have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it he said what are the cornerstone even the ruble by the word of God I'll just say it this way evident in one of the prophets were standing with him because only those prophets knows where the temple is to be built now I'll quote you the guy that Curtis was over in Israel he said Elijah is to come and precede ammos the Moses to bring this temple and he said Elijah will tell us work to put the temple thanks a prophet once you think about carnality just a little bit they destroyed the temple right they rolled off everything but did they care up all those foundation stones and I did safe and others stated it was a one stone left that was not totally annihilated that's all they needed to be able to reconstruct a temple on the same spot just give you a little something well if they just had one time that could restore it I was so amazed when a lady when we were over there and we were looking at pottery and things in an arena where they had killed a Christian who died in such a surreal anyhow oh and that lady I picked up some pieces of pottery and she said listen see if you can find me a quarter or piece a little tip of a handle of a piece of pottery said I can restore it back to original I thought oh okay we found a large stone all right total rule bullets to bring forth the headstone in these hands has laid the foundation okay because that's the word of the Lord now let's read this one and then we'll quit this is why I asked you to read it's called the message of grace I just said message of grace on it and something misunderstood but it's the message of grace I just forget sometimes let's read what your prophet had to say about this Zachariah and listen real careful to what he says we're all acquainted with this scripture that reads the Bible we know that this was during the time of the preparation restoration of the temple and Dhruva bull was a great prince among the people who had laid the foundation of the building listen and now won't you to put on your spiritual thinking anointing jacket this morning as we think this Great Prince had determined to rebuild a house of the Lord and then when he did he had laid the foundation stone roll it over and as we read on further we find that God said ruble has laid the foundation with his hands he also shall bring forth the headstone I want you to notice he never said he shall bring forth the cornerstone he shall bring forth the headstone you read if you notice now he didn't say running forward to Cornerstone see the cornerstone was already laid brother branham never come to lay the cornerstone because the cornerstone was the revelation of Jesus Christ in the faith of the father's given to the disciples so he never had to lay the cornerstone the cornerstone was already laid we just got away from it and Malachi says we're going to turn back to the cornerstone I want you to notice something else as Malachi ends the Old Testament jaw said it would take place Malachi tells you how the headstone was rejected and there was no way the church could come to the headstone now your prophet do you want oh my god I'm late for everybody when I say something that start he said the headstone was rejected he said but it became the cornerstone see this is what we want to do we want to take this stone because it's shaped like this and turn it up here and put it up here or put this stone down here for heaven's sake don't move nothing and I'll give you a carnal illustration that you don't move anything would you mind redrawing that picture and would you hit that put that headstone down on there you realize what you'd have you'd have that right there leave that headstone where it's at we got to grow up into him who is the head the Bible says you bring it down you're going to make your shapes different just plain Carlos finish listen you notice he never said he'll bring forth the cornerstone is you'll bring forth the headstone and we know that the scripture says that Jesus is the chief Cornerstone and he's also the headstone and now if we would think for a few minutes that the 7th church messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the father's in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the Spirit is that what we've been talking about is that what I've been talking about America I want it done listen not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord not my organization not by denomination but by the Holy Spirit God will bring forth the church in the last days the robe of the Prince with Joshua was the one that was to bring forth this headstone he had laid the foundation now what does he call it he took the people back to the foundation in time he never had to relate the cornerstone you don't listen to what I'm saying see we talk about cornerstone we think we know all about it we think this is a cornerstone right here and this is the headstone up here what the games will then walk up in front of one of those banks and try to find me a cornerstone well it's the corner it was the corner I thought no it's not it's the plaque that tells you us in the building's about where's your cornerstone he says first nice nobody establish or anoint your nerves you go under stone right you know that an archway and you put the Keystone in the property call to the cornerstone and can call it the headstone or an archway and put the stone in the middle you remember how to cut down this s in the middle holds it together that's why we think we've got it all figured out because we're talking we're not talking about stones we're talking about a revelation of Jesus Christ those are samples had the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to them by him walking with him and teaching him and in the Holy Spirit Quicken it's not just stones stones or revelation upon this rock I'll build my church well you probably said he didn't say he bring the cornerstone coach Jesus Christ as the chief Cornerstone you say yeah but that was eight down he was in the stone it never took it totally away to get down into the stump and then God began to reveal I just given you a natural story when his rule got back there he looked and he said where was the temple and so I he just sold it out here and started heaven help you in your spirituality that are so carnal he searched until he found the original foundation and it didn't matter what stone he found he knew exactly what happened tell you those pyramids and the things and how perfectly ever stone was in place you show me one stone I'm gonna get technical with you show me one stone I know the violin I know what your prophet is said not everything but I got a little sense of him talking about the stone and the sight show me in the temple where their stone was left out or the natural temple do you think you know all about it show me where the tone was left out of the temple show me the cornerstone left out of any of those pyramids because it's not stoned its revelation he said upon this rock upon this dog I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't prevail against that Church oh yeah they can beat her down they can do everything in order which they can't destroy because God ordained it and it will be just remember what he said he didn't say he'd bring the cornerstone minor cornerstone was already laid in the Apostle right around him didn't have to come back and bring us a new Bible we didn't come and get it william branham translation he says this King James Version is perfect in every form the ends and the Bucks is in the right place he said can you show me like show me one contradiction don't be a garbage can in your mind and I'm gonna show me where the worth it the Bible was all messed up I said before we start don't come up with two blind man by Martin one blind man by Matthew well he didn't do that you know we come he's an untraditional he said here it says it that David had three thousand charge so here he said he had forty thousand some thing I said not to do but he doesn't so I done it too I said don't you understand he had three thousand in one place in 37 thousand in another one don't come up with carnality I'm just saying that they'll be carnal it's not stones that pyramid is not stones that's symbolic this was a revelation of Jesus Christ hey Birchers revelation of Jesus your knowledge temperance who's it a revelation all the Lord Jesus Christ he didn't have to lay the foundation he just built on what they had left it says he laid the foundation with your profits when it said it don't say it's a cornerstone when are you going to listen one two three one two three with your six six things I've got a message to follow this one which I won't get to it till Sunday afternoon I got one report I want to see what your report is I'm making mine I'm saying he's the same yesterday today and forever that's what I've always said listen this prophets the one we claim to believe when are we going to take it and accept it and believe it probably if everything he says no you mind if I bow my head he come to office and tell me you believe everything he said because if you don't I will tell you why can't you do that with money you can do it my office adores it open and never close you ever seen a preacher did that ever seen a preacher in the church leave a door wide open to its polish welcome you anytime I learned that from a plant manager adorable some use it worked adorable no this is the truth you could never go into the front office's they were blocked out a couple little bathrooms you can bridge you into but nothing up in the front office because you had to go do a lot of people and a lot of doors a plant manager came in and he said I want to open door policy he cooked right through the middle of it and made our opening and right there in the door right in that door I came down through that because I wanted to see if he was telling the truth I walked down through that I looked over in there and he says come on hear me a little peon out on the plant you know he said come right on in he said what do you think about going on right now I said y'all oh god screw this is true plant manager I said y'all guys goofed up back in the lace I'm only doing all that I said what y'all goofed up I said it got all messed up but I said you know what now you're getting attention to the people after you told them we're gonna close this plan if you don't fall for it right only one saying my office is doors are open you don't agree with something I say tell me don't come to Miami but once you tell me go tell the world just do that just tell me and then you go tell anybody you want to it's no problem but you see I've made a report to you today on one time Joel said it would happen Malachi tells how it's gonna happen go to random shows how it would happen in his own ministry the Bible speaks of ative of Israel and telling I was going to build a temple and a heathen King was going to supply the material God is going to make them do it he laid a burden on that man's heart I'm just honest I believe he'll get eternal life if you want to do a cup of water in my name he'd have a lot of cup of water but listen in Zachariah tells you about zerubabbel rebuilding the temple rouble represents the end time gnashing jerk because who's going to bring the head stop who's going to bring the system and we know for certain brother brown without the headstone we're going to sense know that we're not the headstone we hit stone people we went on headstone as lively stones you know we know you listen you know what I've said it to you over and over and I'll say it real fast I've always believed since I read it seen it at this prophets message is the headstone to the church notice revelation of Jesus Christ the apostles and prophets were the foundation because it was a revelation that's Jesus Christ this prophet come to brain what wood blocks down through there and the things of Matthew 24 we were talking about that Jesus preached six seals and none of the disciples understood nothing none of them spoke of the seals even the great Apostle Paul never spoke of it we get us to be brought in the end time and I've always made this statement and it sounds comical but it's a means of God's on his crew if everybody in the world seven billion people had the faith of the fathers it would be a wonderful world to live in but there is no headstone to cut off the church to change the body if the son showed me where it say now you get what I'm talking about I'm not sarcastic I'm just coming true you come tell me well I think it's going to be this way brother there well that might be involved in what you're talking about but I'm talking about the headstone what is the headstone brought around can't be the headstone will you smash this key because remember what he says in the days of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mysteries of God should be finished remember what we brought out trying to do God a service without his wheel mistress to be revealed not when he starts out doing this but when he begins to sound his message works his faith expressed our of the seventh angels message when he begins to sound forth the message not in a healing service but the message that follows the healing service how many times you only to quote read around them as the bait on the hook you remember you don't show them the hook cuz you're on the bait on the hook they get caught they got caught people did buy this message by sitting listening and seeing the signs and wonders and some people stayed with it you are proof of it I don't understand it that way that's honor to you you stayed with it when the rest left the message I have heard but now I see when the seller's angel begins to sound his message not the healing service the message that follows the healing service then what are you taking this to be a backup over these so good work if they can get to our quick enough on number six which starts a man here that can turn on relies Luther's manner was the message of justification Wesley's message was the manifestation of sanctification Pentecostals was a restoration of gifts but this is introducing the headstone introducing the headstone standing in a gap he said in a church it was the cornerstone in the full church it was the headstone it never did come because it was rejected who come to come to her is the mystery of godliness the true vine with the fullness of the Spirit and the word will do the very action powers that Jesus did the NS she nears her headstone becoming like him through the word Jesus will come and the bride and groom be there forever the dynamics of this church will be refilling of the Holy Spirit that we have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when the head and body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost will raise her up Christ the mystery of God revealed I love this therefore it's the word or nothing that's right so what is the headstone that that's right he the word how do you know it's right he the word is vindicated see he the word properly vindicated is the headship the head of the church he is the word the headstone what about continuing on down into that message we don't let Louis other thing 29 hold it then our head chef is a kingdom the kingdom of God is within you that the Bible Jesus the kingdom we are not a denomination we belong to the kingdom and the Kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in our own life bringing device every promise in this days as it did in that day when the word and God was one and the word and God is one in his church today making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message in the last day I thought we believed according to cross the mystery of God revealed that the bride was part of the mystery well then she's got to be revealed I'll end with this room crisis the mystery of God revealed paragraph 555 number 11 hey there's only one thing can happen there has to be a message at the end time there's nothing else can follow the nomination can't follow this message you and I can't follow it with our carnality stand together maybe I got enough there I'll continue on something there you don't understand it then get these notes it's like the hidden bodies to unite in the last days to bring the message yeah but I just don't see it what is it does that make it's not true because you don't see it does that make it not true I got a five dollar bill in my pocket then nobody in here can see it and I can't either does that mean it's not true you see what I'm talking about that's why we can turn down the cornerstone and there's no need of talking about the headstone until the cornerstone is probably into reality or the faith of the father's the church to be turned back to the original faith this message is the headstone to the church is what I've always stated my report has always been that this church this message is our head the faith of the fathers was a head back diet of the church Luther's just shall live by faith was added of that day this message is the head to the church then why are we studying murder Dominic could try to find a message I'm told awful nobody we're telling the true one man said when Tommy said I couldn't get a message at all so I went down to Walmart walked around said got a message you know what he preached on when addressing her I'm not going on for me go away I don't go to Walmart and walk around look try to find a message I walk as I did last night sometimes I can't sleep but 30 minutes for an hour come on I'll be up walking around praying because I want this message they don't want you to understand one thing for sure about me I believe this message is a headstone we're not looking for another stone it's this message that begun in the sealed and I've made this statement to you for 40-something years go home get the book that shows you the names of the tapes and you know the messages and just get it 63 and start reading the titles for the sermon after the seals every one of them dealing with eternal life see the faith of the father's can bring us back to that place but yet there's got to be something to change these mortal bodies this can only be this message revealed what about a poet just one one verse anybody has indeed come one minute till 9:00 sorry he's going quit early a bit I want you to see it you can go outside and talk for 45 minutes you like to understand around dollar 45 so go ahead do it we're brother won't wait at 663 anybody have an AED all doors open you're not gonna spend a lot of time [Music] when pain [Music] you [Music] with a courage bolstered up on his word [Applause] [Music] Jesus came and made me I would not be denied old Satan said My Lord was gone and would I praise the Lord all work is done and Christ I would be I would not be the gay man
