[3:39] we trust God but if you got your Bibles
[3:41] tonight I'm going read from two places
[3:44] the book of uh St
[3:47] Mark second chapter and I'm read
[3:50] one I mean four down to the 11th verse
[3:55] and then I'm going to read Hebrews 10
[3:57] and verse 38 and 39
[4:00] and it reads like this and and the Bible
[4:03] said the fourth verse Mark the 2 chapter
[4:06] verse 4 it said and when they could not
[4:09] come now unto him for the Press they
[4:13] uncovered the roof where he was and when
[4:16] they had broke it up they let down the
[4:19] bed where where in the sick of the py
[4:22] laid and when Jesus saw their
[4:25] faith said unto the sick of deposit son
[4:29] thy sins be forgiven thee Hallelujah but
[4:33] there were certain of the scribes said
[4:35] in their reason in their heart how does
[4:38] this man speak why does this man does
[4:41] speak blasphemy who can forgive sin but
[4:45] God
[4:46] only and immediately when Jesus
[4:48] perceived in his spirit that they had
[4:50] reason within themselves he said unto
[4:53] them why ye reason these things in your
[4:56] heart right for it is easy to say to the
[4:59] sick of theity thy sins be forgiven thee
[5:02] or to say rise take up thy bed and
[5:08] walk but that ye may know that the son
[5:12] of man had power on Earth to forgive sin
[5:16] he said to the sick of the apology I say
[5:19] unto thee rise and take up thy bed and
[5:23] go thy way into thy house Hallelujah uh
[5:26] Hebrews
[5:28] 10
[5:31] Hebrews the 10th chapter I'm going to
[5:33] read 38 and 39 verse Hebrews 10 verse 38
[5:38] and 39 it
[5:40] says the just shall live by
[5:44] faith but if any man draw back my soul
[5:48] has no plure in him but we are not of
[5:52] them who draw back unto predition but of
[5:54] them that believe to the saving of the
[5:58] Soul let's pray
[6:00] our gracious
[6:01] father help me one more time to
[6:04] surrender my spirit my body and my soul
[6:06] to you father help me to get myself out
[6:09] of the way Lord now father God I give
[6:11] you all my strength Lord Jesus take full
[6:14] control in Jesus Christ name we pray
[6:17] amen God bless you may be seated one
[6:21] moment thank the Lord for the reading of
[6:23] the word of God this
[6:25] evening I like this we started with the
[6:28] scripture the Bible says here that how
[6:30] if we were reading the scripture here
[6:32] the Bible teaches of that here go Jesus
[6:34] this man they to the roof off this
[6:36] building and they brought down the sick
[6:38] of Theos and this man was sick Jesus say
[6:42] I heal you uh Jesus turned around said
[6:45] thy sins be
[6:46] forgiven and when they hear this they
[6:48] say it ain't no man can do that but God
[6:51] so we find out he and I tell from I took
[6:54] if you notice then I went for I went to
[6:56] Hebrews the Bible say hallel the just
[6:59] shall live by faith and the Bible says
[7:02] if any man draw
[7:04] back my soul have no pledge in
[7:08] him and I want to take for a title
[7:11] tonight leaving
[7:15] forgiveness and bout in the past right
[7:18] on leaving forgiveness and bout in the
[7:22] past right and I want to use this reason
[7:24] I took this thought here because I thank
[7:27] you my brother I reason I took this
[7:29] because I begin as you go around and you
[7:31] begin to preach and you meet people and
[7:34] you begin to realize what people a or
[7:37] what they in their spiritual uh their
[7:40] spiritual growth I find that the thing I
[7:42] find most as I travel with people there
[7:45] that when you go there they all the time
[7:48] coming back for the holy ghost or they
[7:51] all the time coming back oh they always
[7:54] they come in all the time trying to get
[7:56] something that they say that they
[7:58] already had yeah
[7:59] and I looked at this and I begin to
[8:01] realize here I thought what calleda
[8:04] people to go back to the past and I
[8:08] looked at I begin to think on them
[8:09] things and I begin to realize
[8:12] pressure is what CA people to turn back
[8:15] on God cuz I begin to realize Under
[8:18] Pressure normally when pressure build up
[8:21] people either that's not go either go
[8:24] all the way with God or they go back to
[8:27] some habit that they had before they
[8:29] come
[8:30] out or they maybe they feel like I
[8:33] cannot do it no more I might well go
[8:35] back and do it I will have a more fun
[8:37] doing this or they'll turn back to some
[8:40] evil habit that God done brought them
[8:42] out of H so we and we begin to really
[8:45] here pressure what builds us up and the
[8:48] thing the thing of it is the reason we
[8:50] have it cuz people don't go all the way
[8:52] with
[8:54] God they don't go all the way with God
[8:56] they come out and they want to come out
[8:59] under justification and they want to
[9:01] believe under justification H and they
[9:03] begin to they come out they get baptized
[9:06] they come out Hallelujah they they they
[9:08] go for the they ask God to take away
[9:10] their sins hallelujah or or they repent
[9:14] of their sin and when they do this God
[9:17] take away their past
[9:19] sins God take away your past but if you
[9:22] notice it don't say nothing about your
[9:24] future Hallelujah because you got your
[9:27] past sins and you get baptized how go
[9:31] through the water be baptized in the
[9:32] name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and you
[9:35] the the revelation of deal when you go
[9:37] to the water you got to go to the water
[9:39] with Revelation amen H because when you
[9:42] go you got to realize when I L when I go
[9:45] it get baptized that old man he going to
[9:48] die and when I come up out of the water
[9:51] I'm going to be a new creature I'm going
[9:53] to begin to walk a new
[9:56] life so we begin to look in now I hear
[9:59] that so we begin to realize that people
[10:01] go to justification and when they get to
[10:04] repentance no doubt they feel like well
[10:06] that's all I got to do no you got to
[10:08] keep
[10:09] going you don't care you cannot stop
[10:12] just at repentance how you got to go to
[10:15] sanctification how do you clean up your
[10:17] life how do clean everything out but
[10:21] once you clean everything out you still
[10:23] going to have battles right amen you
[10:25] know people say well I still fight that
[10:27] same Spirit of alcohol I see by the
[10:29] spirit of there how in word you sanctify
[10:32] how remember here you still is not right
[10:35] yet you're not all the way to the
[10:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost come and once
[10:40] the baptism of the Holy Ghost come he
[10:43] come down and burn out ever desire that
[10:46] the devil have no more power to hold you
[10:49] back I begin to go here and I look at
[10:52] these things here and I begin to realize
[10:54] here that we got to go all the way and I
[10:56] begin to take some example why people
[10:58] turn back why people fight giving up and
[11:01] turn back how because the devil know
[11:03] what you done
[11:04] yesterday how remember wonder why the
[11:07] devil fight you with your past because
[11:10] that's what he know about you he don't
[11:12] know your future he don't know you come
[11:14] to from God and you going back to God he
[11:17] don't know that but he know what you
[11:18] done yesterday he know what you done
[11:20] five minutes ago so he can take your
[11:22] path and bow to you over and over
[11:25] remember here he's the principalities of
[11:27] the earth he's there he he what you done
[11:29] he hear what you say but he he knows
[11:32] your past but he don't know your
[11:34] future amen say the devil's accused
[11:37] other brother y he stand there night and
[11:40] day accusing you of what you done done
[11:43] right of something you done in your past
[11:46] something you never let go something he
[11:47] bring back here and to hold you back
[11:49] from going on to in the word of God to
[11:51] keep this over your head to keep you
[11:53] Bound in the past H so the devil use
[11:56] your path to hold you back from going
[11:58] all the away with God how do heay he
[12:00] take something that some mistake you
[12:03] made and he take that thing and he keep
[12:05] that thing right there and keep driving
[12:07] it in you so you got to shake
[12:10] yourself H you got to realize when I
[12:13] came to Christ I ain't got no
[12:17] pass let look at this like
[12:20] this I took this thought right here and
[12:23] I begin to realize here when people get
[12:24] under pressure they normally turn back
[12:28] and I looked at egpt when they come out
[12:29] of Egypt when Moses went down and
[12:32] brought him out by the hand of God how
[12:34] the people were rejoicing because they
[12:36] seen the mighty power of Almighty
[12:38] Jehovah God how do they seen the great
[12:41] signs and wonders and they come out
[12:44] shouting and they was having a Revival
[12:47] till they got to the Red
[12:48] Sea when they got to the Red Sea the
[12:51] things started changing how because now
[12:54] there's a circumstance that before them
[12:57] there's something that stop stop them
[12:59] from going over right and with the Red
[13:02] Sea so the Red Sea caused a problem but
[13:05] they a where the problem started right
[13:07] the problem started behind them when
[13:10] they he Pharaoh men coming on them
[13:12] horses right they begin to realize we
[13:16] going to get crushed yeah we might have
[13:18] well stayed in Egypt we could have died
[13:20] back there how did they they start
[13:23] thinking about going backwards instead
[13:25] of going forward but God told Moses the
[13:28] K the peoples say the Egyptian that you
[13:32] see
[13:33] today you ain't going to see no more
[13:36] forever HJ that's what God trying to get
[13:38] us to do he's trying to get us to be
[13:40] still and watch that devil that You'
[13:43] been dealing with today if you speak
[13:45] still you won't see him no
[13:46] more trying to get us to go all the way
[13:49] with
[13:50] God so I begin to go look here and I
[13:53] begin to real here so he fighting us
[13:55] every day with the past he fighting us
[13:57] he trying to keep
[13:59] from going all the way with God how do
[14:01] we find here Paul said you did run
[14:04] well but what hinder you now right in in
[14:08] the word hind means to B back behind or
[14:11] hold back or frustrate lack of
[14:15] Revelation to go forward yeah Hallelujah
[14:18] in other word Paul say you did run well
[14:20] but what made you hold back what made
[14:23] you begin to turn around and say I'm not
[14:26] able to make this rapure how you you
[14:28] start to run don't give up don't look
[14:31] back because Faith ain't got no reverse
[14:33] in it Faith does not have a reverse if
[14:37] you say I believe God here you are
[14:39] saying I'm going all the way right right
[14:42] cuz in other words that what Jesus was
[14:44] trying to teach you he said my soul has
[14:46] no pleasure in them that draw back
[14:49] because going backwards is not Faith
[14:52] right Faith either go forward or it go
[14:54] up how we begin to look
[14:57] here and I begin to realize that we
[15:00] fight these things and I'm going to give
[15:02] we we deal you'll see where we're going
[15:04] in a minute so I begin to think so we
[15:06] find here that because the devil know
[15:09] our weaknesses and he know our path so
[15:11] if you notice when you come to get
[15:13] prayer for for healing you ever thought
[15:15] about this you come up and get prayer
[15:17] for healing you accept what the word
[15:20] said about your
[15:21] healing and and all of a sudden you feel
[15:25] a a peace a ease a free
[15:29] right you be say wow man I say man
[15:32] whatever it was it left me man I
[15:34] breathing it come back nor I feel I feel
[15:36] that God healed me I feel that God
[15:39] healed me I feel that God donees
[15:41] something for me but as soon as you get
[15:43] home yeah and all of a sudden that demon
[15:46] come back to try to put the same
[15:48] symptoms on you because it took Faith to
[15:51] take it off and it take your unbelief to
[15:54] bring it back so he tried to bring back
[15:57] Sy of your past hallu you said well I
[16:01] still
[16:02] feel I got I feel I was delivered in but
[16:05] now I feel like simp and when that simp
[16:08] come back order to keep it but don't
[16:10] sign for the demon H keep your
[16:13] confession I am healed by his scripes
[16:17] all the demon have the ability to come
[16:20] back on
[16:21] you tell we talking about in other words
[16:24] the same faith that takes it away your
[16:27] unbelief with Resurrection that
[16:29] Spirit now I begin to realize here we we
[16:32] want to go all the way with God and we
[16:35] realize here we don't only thing that
[16:38] find that hold people back for going all
[16:40] the way with God H what hold people in
[16:43] the pth is Fe right they fear that God
[16:46] cannot keep what he promised right how
[16:49] they fear that God in way I would hold
[16:53] on but I ain't for sure that God will
[16:55] keep his word first of fear is the
[16:58] evidence of things appearing to be real
[17:00] when it's not there right I said your p
[17:05] is like a ghost right and everybody know
[17:07] how I feel about ghost I don't do the
[17:10] ghost
[17:11] thing I mean I'm just that way I just
[17:13] don't mess around with things with you
[17:15] know everybody got their own little
[17:17] little little Pat PE they got to deal
[17:18] with mine just Happ to be
[17:21] ghost I ain't worri about the things I
[17:23] can hit this the things I hit my fist go
[17:25] through but this is
[17:27] it hey yeah you said what it you said
[17:30] brother that ain't nothing your
[17:31] imagination that well it come from
[17:33] something from the past H only reason I
[17:36] believe that it because somebody told me
[17:39] there and all of a sudden as a child it
[17:41] me they took a grip that I don't tell my
[17:43] children Spirit uh a grandkids uh scary
[17:47] stuff like that because I don't want
[17:49] them to be B by that spirit cuz it took
[17:50] me a long time it took me a long time to
[17:54] overcome that spirit because I just I
[17:56] used to get in the house by myself and
[17:58] all all of a sudden I can hear things
[18:00] walking
[18:02] upstairs you said brother you say oh you
[18:06] that that that's crazy but brother that
[18:08] was that that was that cover from
[18:09] something from the past find people that
[18:12] Scar the dogs right of find what caus
[18:16] that something happen that cause them to
[18:19] take on a spirit of fear and every time
[18:22] a a dog get around they get nervous my
[18:24] wife is scared the death of a dog right
[18:27] Hallelujah so it's something that happen
[18:29] that caus you to F and it only come from
[18:32] the past it come that way with churches
[18:36] not when people come from another church
[18:38] the thing that they fight I'm not going
[18:39] to let this pastor do with the next one
[18:41] do cuz they always go back and judge it
[18:43] by the past how so we begin to real here
[18:46] the past is what people hold hold people
[18:48] back for go fear is what hold people
[18:50] back from going on with God
[18:53] Amen now I begin to look here so I begin
[18:56] to think on them things on fear how the
[18:59] F hinders us something of the past
[19:03] something that we heard of the past that
[19:05] won't let us go on Hallelujah in other
[19:08] word something that's holding you back
[19:10] or bound Hallelujah bound is the it
[19:14] means to bind you in a change bind You
[19:17] by a spirit that you cannot shake loose
[19:20] up andone but we are not coming to be
[19:22] bound by the spirit we come to be loose
[19:25] how do the word come to loose us how
[19:28] what that what the word of God come to
[19:30] do it's not to bound you down or or tie
[19:33] you up it come to loose you from the
[19:36] thing how they begin to go look
[19:39] here I begin to think here so we begin
[19:43] to look at pharoh now we if phoh Works
[19:46] in many different Realms and the in the
[19:50] if we notice in the Book of Numbers when
[19:52] they got ready to go across the over the
[19:55] promised land all of a sudden they come
[19:57] back whereever they that the lamb was
[20:00] there but because they've been hearing
[20:02] about the
[20:04] Giants it had already built up a spirit
[20:06] not to go forward they've been hearing
[20:09] about these Giants on the other side how
[20:11] big they were and the preachers come
[20:14] back oh yeah preaching F to them or
[20:18] telling them that we cannot take the
[20:19] land because we went over there we seen
[20:22] the men they were that big some of them
[20:25] they that big some of them you know when
[20:27] people imagination make things bigger
[20:29] than it
[20:30] is I got a I had a picture for years in
[20:33] my house and this man caught a
[20:35] trout and he was he was looking at this
[20:38] TR and whoever draw the picture they
[20:41] draw the picture and it was asking the
[20:43] man how big it was and he
[20:45] said it was a man standing behind him
[20:52] said just the way people mind go H he
[20:55] what the man that behind him I was
[20:57] looking at the fish in the buget it was
[20:58] about that big he said that big oh H you
[21:02] know how it is with our deer hunters we
[21:04] have a problem with it how big was your
[21:07] deer it was a monster man it was a
[21:12] spike but it's the way the human mind
[21:14] work it always it it what San holds Us
[21:17] by how do it make the thing look bigger
[21:20] than what it is how do something to keep
[21:22] you from going on so I begin to realize
[21:24] here I begin to think on these things
[21:26] here I want to deal with the to hold
[21:28] people back the
[21:30] most people going deal with the spirit
[21:32] we need to deal with the spirit to hold
[21:33] people back the most hallelu so I begin
[21:36] to look here and I study this and I
[21:38] begin to study in the past and then
[21:41] words and Jesus said here uh and when
[21:44] Jesus was deal with these things here he
[21:46] says here in St Matthew 6:15 if they
[21:50] would not forgive men of their
[21:52] trespasses then will your heavenly
[21:53] father forgive you of your trespasses so
[21:56] did he use the word did I here I begin
[21:58] to say let's go on a little further and
[22:00] then look what hold people back and I
[22:03] took it here if you remember the story
[22:06] King Saul Hallelujah now the thing of it
[22:10] was with Saul and David was that Saul
[22:14] should have been giving David praise oh
[22:16] yeah right David the one that solved the
[22:19] problem for Israel Hallelujah David the
[22:22] one went out there slew Goliath how
[22:24] David went out there and took it on the
[22:27] word of the Lord to face a giant that sa
[22:30] should had done
[22:31] himself and David took the word of God
[22:35] and brought this un Su down to his knee
[22:38] and cut his head off sa should have been
[22:41] happy right what it is what I'm trying
[22:44] to say a lot of time we worri about who
[22:47] the preacher is to kill the giant don't
[22:49] matter who the preacher is to kill it as
[22:51] long as the J got killed if brother
[22:53] Wayne kill it brother Sam kill it or any
[22:56] other preacher bring that demon down we
[22:58] ought to say thank God that God got a
[23:00] gift in the body to get rid of this
[23:04] child but what it is we won't do that if
[23:07] I ain't the one to kill him then I got a
[23:09] problem but the point the problem is
[23:12] let's give praise to the gift that God
[23:14] used to kill it because that giant is
[23:17] the problem not the
[23:19] gift so
[23:21] so should have glorified and begin to
[23:25] say David thank you thank God he raised
[23:28] you up to do the job thank you David
[23:31] Hallelujah that you had enough faith in
[23:33] God Hallelujah to stand out that Faith
[23:36] Goliath I want you to set at my Royal
[23:38] table I want you to eat from my Royal
[23:40] seat I want to hey give David the best
[23:43] house get David I want David to know
[23:45] that Israel is Happy what he
[23:48] doneen but something happened right the
[23:51] caus David to withdraw I mean Calla Saul
[23:55] to withdraw on David and we find out
[23:57] here that Saul had a
[24:00] problem and and and we find out here
[24:02] that what caused the problem was the
[24:05] church the church because the women was
[24:07] the type of the church and if you notice
[24:10] here the women begin to say David killed
[24:14] his 10,000 right and so his thousands
[24:17] right and what happened to that it
[24:20] brought a spirit of a alt against David
[24:24] Without a Cause come on and the Bible
[24:26] said we can be hat it Without a Cause
[24:29] come on without even doing something to
[24:31] people sometime they hate you that's
[24:33] right but we cannot let that hold us
[24:35] back amen then we begin to look
[24:39] here an ALT come and it was a false alt
[24:43] on so it was something he was believing
[24:46] about David and David hadn't done
[24:47] nothing to him right and that all was
[24:49] the thing all is something that somebody
[24:53] done to you in the past that's how you
[24:55] get old somebody done something to you
[24:57] you and you never let go of it h you
[25:01] were never able to overcome that thing
[25:03] that happened to you in the past right
[25:06] well if you don't let go of it you can't
[25:08] go no forth right because the Bible say
[25:11] here when Jesus begin to teach on the
[25:13] past this is what he said this is how he
[25:15] taught it his disciples was coming down
[25:18] the road one day and Jesus came up on
[25:21] the Fig Tree and Jesus seen this fig
[25:24] tree and Jesus said I curse you that no
[25:28] man eat here after never eat from you
[25:30] again right his disciples was with Jesus
[25:33] when this happened and the disciples
[25:36] looked at this thing they
[25:38] says what's wrong with him what's wrong
[25:41] with the master every time I turn around
[25:43] he's saying something don't make sense
[25:45] because they were looking to see the
[25:47] evidence from the outside but when you
[25:50] cat a demon it's cat from the inside you
[25:53] don't kill a demon from the outside you
[25:55] got to go down to the root Jesus killed
[25:58] the tree from The Roots so the disciples
[26:01] the Bible say they went on you know they
[26:03] went on had church or whatever they did
[26:05] and they came back the same way I'm sure
[26:09] the disciples going to make sure that
[26:10] Jesus went back that way cuz in their
[26:12] mind for them to be thinking about that
[26:14] tree it had to be already in their mind
[26:16] they wanted to go back CU they wanted to
[26:18] see what happened right how and all of a
[26:20] sudden they go down the road and Peter
[26:22] knew the
[26:23] spot I made sure I Mark that spot in my
[26:26] head when I get back to that tree I'm
[26:28] going to make see what happened to that
[26:29] tree how all of a sudden they get back
[26:32] to that tree and the Bible say how Peter
[26:35] remember what Jesus said and Peter said
[26:38] the tree had went it
[26:41] away you other word no evidence but when
[26:44] Jesus said it the tree already was dead
[26:47] how when God tell you you're healed a
[26:49] lot of times you don't see no evidence
[26:51] but when the word tell you you heal you
[26:54] accept your healing so the word can go
[26:56] to work Hallelujah it don't might not
[26:58] happen right there it might not happen
[27:00] the next day but you accept it right
[27:02] there show the word can go to
[27:03] work so Jesus says here I want you to
[27:08] noce the story that Jesus gave Jesus
[27:12] when they said the tree withed way Jesus
[27:14] didn't go into a laot he didn't go into
[27:16] a lot of this why the tree with away I
[27:19] done this Jesus says have faith in God
[27:24] hallelujah he went right to the he went
[27:26] right to the source he said have faith
[27:29] in God he said if you believe and have
[27:33] faith and not doubt in your heart he
[27:35] said you can say to this mountain be I
[27:38] removed and it shall obey
[27:41] you he goes and start bring it in then
[27:44] he brings it to something that will hold
[27:47] you back right he said but if you come
[27:50] to this mountain and you got old right
[27:53] he said wait a minute it ain't going to
[27:55] work for you right because something is
[27:57] is in you to hold you back from going on
[27:59] with God it's something that if you got
[28:02] hold all of your heart you bring your
[28:04] gift he they first go back and get that
[28:07] thing made right so nothing can stand
[28:10] between you and the power of the Holy
[28:12] Ghost H how is what holds the back
[28:15] right till we begin to go look here and
[28:18] just take a step
[28:20] for so we begin to realize here it's
[28:22] always been things to try to hold us
[28:24] back to keep us from going all the way
[28:27] with God the past is always what hell
[28:30] people about people can't let go of
[28:32] something that they done and they feel
[28:34] like God ain't going to forgive me
[28:36] because I can't accept that I'm forgiven
[28:39] right and if you can't accept you
[28:41] forgiven God can't help you that's right
[28:44] first all you got to believe that he can
[28:45] do it and if you can believe that he
[28:48] done it for you then you might as well
[28:50] whatever your second say there lay it on
[28:52] the altar say Here I Am Lord take amen
[28:55] but people don't do that right they
[28:58] always trying to R it out they TR the
[29:00] devil come back and say boo they always
[29:03] remember well i' to had this I know I'm
[29:05] not good enough how long did it take you
[29:07] to figure out you wasn't good
[29:10] enough sometime it take a person whole
[29:13] life time to come to the Revelation I am
[29:16] not good enough if you was good enough
[29:19] Christ didn't need to come and take your
[29:21] place he knew that you were not good
[29:24] enough so he came himself to take your
[29:26] place
[29:27] so I begin to go here let just take this
[29:30] here so we begin to realiz passes what
[29:33] hold people back we got we must move on
[29:36] if we realize here we realize here when
[29:39] Jesus came people the people that Jesus
[29:41] was trying to lose they were help back
[29:43] in the past right right if you know when
[29:46] Jesus come to bring them for the light
[29:48] they say Abraham be our
[29:52] father you see what I'm saying they
[29:54] wouldn't want to go forward they was
[29:55] looking in the past H We Believe Abraham
[29:59] we be we be Moses children hu they
[30:03] always went back to the past we had Mana
[30:07] in the wilderness Hallelujah so a they
[30:10] was back in the past the reason they can
[30:13] stay with Mana because they never cross
[30:15] Jordan if they would have crossed Jordan
[30:17] they would have had the old
[30:19] corn only thing they remember was man
[30:23] but when they went on the other side
[30:24] they had eat old corner of the land and
[30:26] they never crossed over right right so
[30:29] they could not go no further than Moses
[30:33] right they could not see the position
[30:35] that Joshua C them over there and
[30:37] positionally plac them in their promises
[30:40] so they stayed on the other side of the
[30:42] Jordan and they can remember we at mana
[30:45] and Jesus said every one of you that had
[30:48] Mana is dead right he said your father
[30:51] had man in the wilderness and every one
[30:53] of them is dead H because it tough more
[30:56] than man except you eat my flesh and
[30:59] drink my
[31:00] blood and the Bible says it come to
[31:04] finally from that
[31:07] time from that time many of his
[31:10] disciples went back and walked no more
[31:13] with him went back to what they didn't
[31:15] quit going to church no they didn't quit
[31:18] going to church they just didn't follow
[31:20] the word and when they went backwards
[31:23] how did my soul have no p in there that
[31:26] go back he scra name off the
[31:29] bookly the Bible tell us one place the
[31:33] remember lot
[31:34] wife remember lot wife what about lot
[31:38] wife she was too called up in the when
[31:41] the angel come to bring Miss lot out
[31:43] Miss lot was living it up even though
[31:46] that solom night condition down there
[31:48] she was willing to deal with all that
[31:49] perverted living just to have money to
[31:52] have a good time so she didn't really so
[31:54] the angel come down there and gave her
[31:56] commit to lot told lot to tell M lot to
[32:01] come out and not look
[32:03] back now I want to tell you what Miss
[32:05] lot brought her body
[32:08] out if she could have got a hard to come
[32:10] with us she would have made it but she
[32:13] come out with a body and L a ho back
[32:16] there I said just like people come to
[32:19] church a lot of time they bring the body
[32:21] to church and the heart still at Walmart
[32:24] right now if you can get your hard to
[32:25] leave Walmart can come to church with
[32:27] you we have a good time tonight but the
[32:29] way people do the thing that they need
[32:31] to do a lot of time they breaking the
[32:33] body and they doing something else but
[32:35] when you bring your body to church bring
[32:37] your heart the same way so God can speak
[32:39] to
[32:41] you and we begin to go here look here so
[32:44] they you know the story Miss lot she
[32:46] came out but her ho never came out and
[32:50] what ho was her treasure was so because
[32:54] she never let go of her pass right come
[32:56] on amen the ability to turn back on God
[32:59] was in her right so she had something in
[33:02] her that could turn back on God because
[33:04] she never brought a heart with her right
[33:06] so she could turn back cuz that's what
[33:08] her heart was and that's what her pull
[33:10] was so the Bible say she turned back and
[33:13] she turned it to
[33:15] Pilla people let us make up our
[33:18] mind that we going to go all the way but
[33:21] God we not got to make up our mind that
[33:23] we going to if I'm going to start out
[33:25] with him give me a Revelation Lord to go
[33:28] all the way hallelu Lord let go of my
[33:31] past Hallelujah I need to let go of my
[33:34] past you can not undo what you'd
[33:36] undone so it ain't no use to you putting
[33:39] yourself in chain on something you can't
[33:41] undo if you going undo it that Christ
[33:44] didn't need to
[33:45] come I I looked here when Paul
[33:49] came if you notice Paul said these words
[33:54] he said though we are
[33:55] angel preach any other gospel unto you
[33:59] and what we have preached let it be a
[34:01] curse amen why because Paul was
[34:03] preaching present truth and if an angel
[34:06] come and change what they preach they'll
[34:09] holy you back from going on and then
[34:12] would the do is that why we got to have
[34:14] the truth because the truth come to set
[34:16] you free H if they're not preach the
[34:19] truth you still in the past right so
[34:22] Paul said it like this if you remember
[34:23] when Paul went up through acts acts the
[34:25] 19th Chapter
[34:28] he found some Believers that need to be
[34:31] loose yeah he found Believers but they
[34:34] was bound and he came and you know the
[34:37] story he came up through the upper coast
[34:39] of Kip and then when he got there he
[34:42] found certain disciple that had the
[34:45] letter right but they needed the
[34:47] mechanic the
[34:48] Dynamics they had the mechanics right
[34:51] but they didn't have the Dynamics and
[34:54] without the dynamic they could not go no
[34:56] further they was bound thank the Paul
[35:00] came and what the Paul says to them had
[35:03] you received the Holy Ghost s you
[35:07] believe and watch their testimony we not
[35:10] even know that be of a holy ghost we not
[35:13] even such as her of there even be a
[35:15] thing of the Holy Ghost and Paul said
[35:18] all right then what would you baptize in
[35:22] see people say baptism don't mean
[35:24] something oh yes don't let the devil
[35:26] tell you that lie to hold you back
[35:28] that's right Hallelujah so he said then
[35:30] what would you baptized in and they said
[35:32] we was baptized under JN Paul say all
[35:36] right John he baptize you under
[35:38] repentance looking for one to come to
[35:40] baptize you with the Holy Ghost Fire he
[35:42] said they when they heard this right
[35:45] they were re-baptized come on in the
[35:48] name of Jesus Christ right and they
[35:50] reive the Holy Ghost
[35:51] amen so the devil knew it was a
[35:55] truth to the devil is he he he's
[35:59] smart the Bible said better be wiser
[36:01] than him it ain't that he's not smart so
[36:04] what do he do he know what held them
[36:07] back he knew it lies in the secret of uh
[36:11] receiving the Holy Ghost right so what
[36:13] do he do he goes up at 325
[36:15] ad what do he tap the baptism come on
[36:19] because he knew if they didn't get
[36:21] baptized right they couldn't go forward
[36:23] that's right and if they don't get the
[36:25] Holy Ghost they still in the past right
[36:27] so what he did he changed the baptism
[36:30] right
[36:32] 32258 let's change it right CU one time
[36:35] the Catholic Church baptized say we did
[36:37] right so what he did he said if I change
[36:40] it then Paul then conation 18 say though
[36:44] we Angel changes gospel come on then
[36:48] what do it do it pull them people back
[36:50] in the past that why they have church
[36:52] today come on Amen all of the
[36:54] denomination that baptized in the
[36:56] trinity they still in the past that's
[36:58] right because father is not a name come
[37:01] on son is not a name the holy spirit is
[37:04] not a name it's a person Jesus Christ
[37:07] amen hallelujah any is a person the
[37:10] whole family in heaven the name Jesus
[37:12] the whole family in Earth Day Jah and
[37:14] how can you be saved without taking his
[37:16] name that's right man see what he did he
[37:20] used he reversed it and he turned around
[37:22] and say it really don't matter what you
[37:24] baptize
[37:25] in I'm not preach Baptist but it's show
[37:28] you how Satan come in and got the world
[37:30] what did he do today the people couldn't
[37:33] have got in delusion the way the world
[37:35] is today if they would have got the Holy
[37:37] Ghost on so because he scri the people
[37:41] from getting the Holy Ghost now look
[37:43] what he doing right he can got he can
[37:45] take over him anytime he want to because
[37:47] they Ain got nobody to fight for him
[37:49] that's right and the only reason that
[37:50] you got something you got a power that's
[37:53] within you that greatest he that's in
[37:55] you that he that's in the world you got
[37:57] something to fight
[37:58] with the world ain't got nothing to
[38:00] fight with right demons take them over
[38:03] anytime they want to tell them go down
[38:05] here and kill some so they just get up
[38:07] and do it they have nothing to restra
[38:09] them but you got a power that's on the
[38:11] inside of you something that you don't
[38:13] even understand yourself call the Holy
[38:15] Ghost it's able to keep you in the time
[38:17] of
[38:19] trouble Hallelujah so we talking about
[38:22] past now remember here and the thing of
[38:26] it is
[38:27] pths need to be removed yeah cuz
[38:31] sometime people's beating themselves up
[38:33] for things that happen ungodly things
[38:36] they done they never never overcome that
[38:42] and the reason they never overcome that
[38:44] they never looked at what Jesus done for
[38:46] them that's right they looking at well I
[38:48] just can't see how I can make it with
[38:49] that I don't need I couldn't understand
[38:51] how I can make it but but but Christ
[38:53] came by Revelation see because as long
[38:56] as you got a
[38:58] pass you got condemnation right because
[39:01] condemnation come from something you
[39:03] done in the
[39:05] past something that you know that you
[39:07] know stuff and we all have things that
[39:09] we done that we wouldn't be proud of
[39:10] that's right we all got things that we
[39:12] battle with that we wouldn't be proud of
[39:14] but the point of it is you cannot stay
[39:16] in that
[39:17] spot because the devil know as long as
[39:20] you stay in that spot beating yourself
[39:22] up you save him no trouble
[39:25] right
[39:27] exactly cuz he putting stuff on the
[39:29] devil he didn't do devil brother all
[39:32] they got to do is accept Jesus they'll
[39:33] be all right but they the people don't
[39:35] come to the point now where they they
[39:38] trying to do it themselves how did man
[39:39] to be lovers of them more than lovers of
[39:41] God think he can do it himself I I I I
[39:44] believe I can hand myself no you cannot
[39:47] you cannot fight this spiritual war
[39:49] while your own or human ability you got
[39:52] to give Christ to you the reason the
[39:54] power let loose and let him do it
[39:57] am I begin to realize here I here now
[40:01] look at here I I thought about R ra had
[40:05] a pass real bad P by the way she had a
[40:10] real bad
[40:11] pass and everybody in the town knew RAB
[40:15] pass the Bible say RAB the Harlot H
[40:19] that's how the Bible anounces in the
[40:21] book of Hebrews right have the Harlot
[40:24] but the only thing about it that was
[40:26] nobody there to condemn
[40:28] her there was nobody there to
[40:30] say was with my cousin or with my uncle
[40:34] all she didn't have nobody that had
[40:36] evidence against her because when they
[40:39] went through the city the city fell amen
[40:42] and all her accuses died oh my so R
[40:46] didn't have nobody that l in charge
[40:48] against
[40:48] her right amen I said
[40:52] real I said what we got to get today we
[40:54] got to get somebody
[40:56] we got to get somebody to drop the
[40:59] charges on us right because we always
[41:02] guilty right if you was born without the
[41:06] spoken word birth you got
[41:10] problems and I guarantee it ain't nobody
[41:12] here can say they was born right
[41:15] poof and just come on the
[41:17] scene you were born without the spok
[41:20] word birth you had a problem how about
[41:23] in the natural the way you come to the
[41:25] Earth everybody that's in here was born
[41:28] by
[41:29] sensation how it ain't nobody in here
[41:32] that not come that way right right
[41:34] outside of
[41:35] Christ he the only one came different
[41:37] from that that why he was the only one
[41:39] worthy to take your place Hallelujah but
[41:41] everybody here was born with a nature
[41:44] that had fallen and automatic you was a
[41:47] liar to begin
[41:49] with exactly amen now I ain't going to
[41:53] ask somebody to raise their hand but if
[41:55] I did
[41:58] how many here told a lie I had to be the
[42:00] first to raise my
[42:01] hand I didn't if I said tell lie I had
[42:04] to put the S on
[42:08] mine I mean you know what I'm talking
[42:11] about brother you might be perfect you
[42:12] might not have done that but I did okay
[42:15] okay okay did you believe Hallelujah you
[42:18] know some of them I told so much even
[42:20] now I'm scared to talk about it cuz I
[42:22] forgot two
[42:25] f
[42:27] oh yeah I know what you said I don't
[42:28] been there to I go to tell something I'm
[42:31] tring to think sometime but that the
[42:32] truth or that's one of my yes sir yes
[42:36] sir the Bible say you can tell it over
[42:38] and over you tell a lie so long you can
[42:41] believe it right that's true you can
[42:44] believe that you can tell yourself so
[42:46] long and lie to yourself so long I'm not
[42:49] forgiving you'll start believing that
[42:51] come on now why we got people in that
[42:54] mythical condition today all the Joy
[42:56] going because as long as you defeated
[42:58] Brother Sam come and preach the word to
[42:59] you you can never rise above that
[43:01] because you got something hanging over
[43:02] your
[43:04] head and if you ever get that off your
[43:06] head then you can start say Lord I'm
[43:08] free right H I am set free right but I'm
[43:13] going to say
[43:14] this I might told this before when Jesus
[43:16] cut that woman in the act of
[43:19] adultery when he C caught her in the act
[43:21] of
[43:22] adultery she was literally it's no way
[43:26] out of it she was guilty amen that that
[43:32] what the levitical law said Leviticus
[43:34] the 20 and I want you to notice when the
[43:36] devil come quoting this her when they
[43:39] come quoting this they were using the
[43:42] scripture they use the scripture they
[43:45] would not just come in to th I they use
[43:48] the scripture say we cut her in
[43:51] adultery and Leviticus the 20th chapter
[43:55] tell us the story her y but what do you
[43:57] say yeah now first
[44:00] all these Jers they they real they real
[44:03] good first off let me know if you ain't
[44:06] never looked at like this people when
[44:08] they read this they reading it in just
[44:10] well they read the story he caught this
[44:12] little woman Hallelujah and the
[44:14] Pharisees come down there and asked
[44:15] Jesus said Jesus what you going to do
[44:18] Jesus said that he right down the stone
[44:19] here that go and she was set free that
[44:21] ain't nothing you just looking at half
[44:22] of the picture first off Pharisees knew
[44:27] if they kill that woman without a man
[44:29] they'll get
[44:30] stoned those guys were trained in the
[44:33] word right you don't think they were
[44:35] coming down there quoting Leviticus
[44:36] hallelu and Leviticus the 20th chapter
[44:39] that we should stole her without a man
[44:41] they would have got killed for doing
[44:42] that that's
[44:44] right oh yeah they going to kill
[44:47] somebody oh yeah they had a man to kill
[44:50] yeah it says and they asked Jesus what
[44:54] do you say that's right you know why
[44:56] they asked Jesus that cuz they knew
[44:58] Jesus been preaching love and
[45:00] forgiveness they were looking for Jesus
[45:02] to blashe they were looking for Jesus
[45:05] and say forgive her and not Stone her
[45:08] and they were going to say you blashe
[45:11] right now how you know that why you
[45:14] think I read Mark the second chapter now
[45:17] you can look at why he said that when
[45:18] Jesus brought the py boy down he said
[45:21] your said thy sins be forgiven the what
[45:23] did they say he speak blasphemous come
[45:26] on Hallelujah they thought it was
[45:28] blaspheming for him to say now if he
[45:30] would have said forgive her they going
[45:32] to kill him for
[45:34] blaspheming then they had a second back
[45:37] up play yeah the Roman law protected her
[45:41] right and if
[45:42] she if Jesus said kill her they will use
[45:46] the law Caesar he not he breaking the
[45:49] law ceson they going to get me the way
[45:51] yeah so Jesus had no way out yeah but
[45:56] being the word he know there was a bunch
[45:58] of devils and Liars all he need is
[46:00] evidence he can disqualify the whole
[46:02] case Hallelujah you got evidence you can
[46:04] drop charges how a man that got evidence
[46:06] they been forgiven how when the devil
[46:08] come after you you got evidence you been
[46:10] forgiven how you can drop the charges
[46:12] how tell that devil I the charges been
[46:17] dropped this woman didn't need attorney

[51:48] let the devil put you back don't go back
[51:50] and dig up your old
[51:53] husband right oh L but the point of it
[51:55] is everybody hate to get rid of
[51:58] it I buried him six years ago I start
[52:02] feeling sorry for him I went back and
[52:03] got
[52:05] it if you bur him you drive a steak down
[52:10] you leave it right there if you accepted
[52:12] Jesus for your your party you accepted
[52:15] Jesus for the grace you accept him for
[52:17] your mercy you leave the stakes down
[52:19] don't let the devil pull you back under
[52:21] something that God done done for you if
[52:23] God tell you you healed you have stay
[52:26] down right amen don't you never pull
[52:28] that up stand on that St say I am healed
[52:31] I'm not going to pull that demon back up
[52:34] I don't understand why people like these
[52:36] Spirits right you know some people love
[52:40] Spirits I
[52:42] tell I never been here since I told this
[52:46] Hallelujah I had a disease taed my body
[52:49] a while
[52:50] back man I brother wait I'm going to
[52:52] tell you I start getting real nervous I
[52:54] start Bleeding Through the bows I knew
[52:57] something was wrong but one night I said
[53:00] I'm going up and get prayer for I said
[53:02] Lord I said I ain't got no insurance I'm
[53:05] trusting you for healing not I got
[53:07] insurance like life insurance that's
[53:09] benefiting my wife that ain't benefiting
[53:14] me one person get happy on life is that
[53:17] sh want to Left
[53:19] Behind so I'm thinking I got a lot of
[53:22] life insurance I'm talking about medical
[53:23] insurance and I'm thinking that I said
[53:25] Lord I ain't got nothing how when
[53:27] normally when you ain't got nothing
[53:28] that's to turn to you trust God anyway H
[53:31] when all other options gone that you
[53:33] have to turn to God that why Africans
[53:34] see more sze and one we see because they
[53:37] ain't got nothing else to turn to but
[53:39] God so you'll see the explor miracles
[53:42] happen because when they come to the end
[53:43] all they got is God they hold on to it
[53:46] that's right but you know when you over
[53:47] heing the devil he educated everybody
[53:49] around and you got insurance so you say
[53:51] well I can go to the doctor I can get
[53:53] this heal why not go to Christ and
[53:54] believe him it's harder to believe
[53:56] because you got you got a bag up plan H
[53:58] if we didn't have a bag of plan we had
[54:00] to hold on to God he the parish when I
[54:03] was at that point I said Lord you to
[54:04] heal me right I said I got no other
[54:06] solution I said this is all I know Lord
[54:09] I went and God prayer for did it stopped
[54:12] no it didn't but I can't believe nothing
[54:15] Lord I'm here I don't know when it
[54:17] stopped it just stopped H I know that
[54:20] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[54:22] amen H St trying to get they accept
[54:26] Faith they accept Revelation they accept
[54:29] his forgiveness power and word he said
[54:32] didn't you know we I guess y'all May
[54:34] heard about the
[54:35] testimony closing now brother Tim had a
[54:39] youth service you heard about that way
[54:41] right he had us Serv a few months ago
[54:44] and when we did a little girl 18 years
[54:45] old she got up and go saying did you
[54:48] hear about that brother she walked right
[54:50] up past me and when she did she just
[54:53] boom and I looked at her I said oh my
[54:55] God she
[54:59] said boy just stopped I said man I said
[55:02] be Qui everybody I said everybody be
[55:04] still I said God is in control we pray
[55:07] for this young lady right then all of a
[55:09] sudden she she got up she was looking
[55:12] around you can tell something had
[55:13] happened and we had medical doctors that
[55:16] they uh nurses that they was dealing
[55:18] with and there they like that in other
[55:20] words so that you know quite not every
[55:22] about thinking it was a heart attack it
[55:23] was a stroke it was a it was EP demon
[55:25] and everything so God brought her back
[55:28] she she was on a Saturday she got up and
[55:31] she went to that and she sung a song and
[55:33] she praised God on that up there with
[55:35] the Quiet that she done done there Hall

[59:48] Sunday and they told a story about a
[59:51] woman a old lady that was one want to

[59:59] every
[1:00:00] Sunday it was a mountain between her and
[1:00:03] the
[1:00:04] church so before she could get to church
[1:00:07] her son would pick up and they had to
[1:00:08] drive all the way around this mountain
[1:00:10] to get to church if that mountain wasn't
[1:00:12] there she could be right at church so
[1:00:15] one day one morning her son was there
[1:00:17] and the mother been reading that
[1:00:18] scripture you can say to this mountain
[1:00:20] so a son moved up there to the mountain
[1:00:22] and a mama said stop son
[1:00:25] he probably think what is mama doing she
[1:00:27] walks over to that mountain she said in
