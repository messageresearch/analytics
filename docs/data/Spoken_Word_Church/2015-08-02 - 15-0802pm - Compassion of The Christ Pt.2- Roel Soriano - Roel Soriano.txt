willing we're going to continue our message this afternoon on the compassion of the Christ amen but be before we go to that I just would like to make a little report on what's been happening in our country by uh way of the mystery Expo seminars amen you may be seated for just a little while amen well if the presentation is ready okay uh this is something that that I think uh right now only happens in our country in the Philippines you know and uh the Lord has given us the inspiration to devise a way to uh take the message to denominational Realms because for for the longest time we've been uh inviting people to come to our meetings uh so they can hear the presentation of the message and they wouldn't come right so what we what we did we just took the message to them we started befriending the uh ministers and the leaders especially of uh different denominational Association Ministerial Association and challenge them that uh we would feed them and uh maybe give them um uh literature and bibles even uh for as long as they can uh they're willing to sit down for a whole day and listen to what we have to say right and uh the Lord really blessed our effort amen hallelujah sir next slide please uh you know but talked about end time evangelism right so this is evangelism uh uh especially meant for the end time so um in 2002 we launched a brave move to present the teachings of the message to denominational ministers Ministerial Association and since then we have presented the message to different regions of the country and God bless the effort and whole churches embrace the message as a result this is a historic Expo seminar that we held in uh Ral Palawan that actually started the Revival in Palawan uh I don't think there is a place uh in the whole country where uh a Revival such as this is taking place now it's in the island of Palawan by the way Palawan the island of Palawan has been voted as the most beautiful island in the whole world can you believe that and uh we were there with brother brother Wade and brother Wade saw one of the expost that we conducted there and he participated in it and the people really appreciated what he had to say about Elijah well the the this picture the Mr Expo seminar we conducted we conducted in Ral town uh in 2012 were 15 ministers from the Baptist and the Pentecostal Realms uh they attended and out of the seminar dozens of ministers have re receiv received the message and are now sharing it with their congregation and many others now this is what I call the buffer crop next Slide the buffer crop this is the latest uh batch of ministers that have received the message because of the Expo seminars amen here's a picture of the latest crop of converts in the island of Pala and we have baptized over 60 ministers over 60 ministers on this island and are now in the process of helping these pastors present the message to their respective churches we now work with over 50 churches and have baptized more than 20 whole congregations in the process glory to God hallelujah amen and here's a picture of the minister converts from different regions of the Philippines converts from different regions of the country are crying out for message materials meaning CDs tracks books tablets laptops to gain more knowledge about the message that we believe and be able to share the same to their people we have voice of God recording to help us but uh we need more than what they are willing to give that's right equipping the next step now is to equip the ministers with correct understanding of the message and to help them get the church established in the word amen our church have been sending teachers along with Bibles and message materials to the churches uh to their churches to help them with Ministry and toote to promote fellowship with other message churches we need to get them established in the word amen yes sir because you know as long as as as soon as they come in the false Doctrine groups they also come oh yeah you know and try to prelate them and that's why there's a real need for Teaching Ministry by the way you're really needed over there and uh uh to to to get the people established in the word here's a picture of uh the Church of brother Edward brother Edwards sealian uh was a former believe uh Bible School professor and has been ejected out of his house and church for teaching the people the message of the hour and he has been stripped of all financial support and is now excommunicated from the group this is now his temporary Church which he erected on borrowed land but when uh brother Wade was there somebody donated a lot to this brother and now they erected a simple church but it's a much better uh church building now where they hold their services so we are praying to upgrade some of the uh house of worship or churches uh where the new young believers are gathering now brother Edward sealian and family prominent members of the Christian Fellowship Incorporated have been ejected from their home and church and the brothers there there you you see them in the picture the brothers had to transport this house this house in the picture for 2 kilometers so brother Edward and family can have a temporary shelter they literally lifted the house for 2 kilm so that they can have a place to live in women preachers are being enlightened this sister here is brother Edward's wife sister bang sealian many women preachers like sister bang who graduated from B Bible school and has pastored for over 10 years now have stopped preaching and are are and are now helping their husbands in the ministry amen amen you know am I admire women preachers that know when to stop amen once they hear the message they stop that's right hallelujah thank you Lord amen and then the minister of the SS decides to be baptized over most of the ministers that we working with are uh uh from the TR trinitarian organizations like the Baptist and the charismatic Pentecostal groups um the picture above is myself baptizing uh for four of the ministers and the picture below is our brother Wade here baptizing two couples and by the way these two couples are on fire for the message just turning the city up upside down amen for to Princessa City am Hallelujah and uh after receiving the message what happens usually is they they ask us to present the message to their congregation because they don't know how to yeah sure so they we help them we go visit their churches and we send ministers uh to preach to them the message of the hour and after about um uh sometime then that they decide to be baptized as well amen yeah amen you see de brother lto solo and six other brothers they helped me in following up on the young churches in learning the fundamentals of the message about uh after about a month of teaching they decide to receive B uh scripture of baptism water baptism as well um here's the latest B batch of converts the photograph downstairs uh the latest bats of converts came mainly from a dozen churches of the Free Methodist movement it a split it's a split of of the United Methodist Church so uh 16 ministers are now in touch with us and wanting more seminars follow-up seminars amen for their group amen that's their people there being baptized and other churches are following suit we need all the ministry that we can get to help these new churches get established in the word they are crying out for more of the message amise the Lord and a lot of other groups are waiting to be baptized over we just don't have the time and the manpower to go to all these places so that they can be baptized over again my projection is that within a year's time most of the new pastors congregation numbering approximately 60 will have been baptized the message way and we need to send more ministers to help groups in the far flung places like the ones the uh I mentioned this morning where you have to walk 8 hours to uh get to the place place and uh some of the churches are in um uh farflung Islands as well is the island of Palawan is is actually a an island group made up of 300 Islands right there in Palawan so there are many many churches now that believe uh this message on the island here's here are two pictures of some of the tribal churches two tribal churches that came in suud southern Palawan uh there are 15 Mountain churches like this that are now learning the message because their tribal tribal pastors receive the message through the Expos we help these churches educate their own children as the nearest school is 8 hours away on foot the nearest school so we decided to just start a school right where they are living so right now we're helping the uh the teachers with with salary and the um some um uh school supplies and books that are badly needed here's a picture of a UPC Church by the way it has been to this church coming to the message the pastor's name is brother Ro Roberto limp Amen brother Rober Roberto limp of Puerto Princessa Palawan just recently baptized his members in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he was former UPC so we get all groups from of Believers and churches from all kinds of groups denominational groups right glory to God and here's another Pentecostal Oneness church called The Family Revival Pentecostal Oneness group one of the churches of the Family Revival Oneness organization whose leader Reverend saldi suon you met him I don't know if you remember brother brother Wade but you met him but he has led eight of their churches in Palawan to the message amen Reverend Susan has a good grasp of the message and is now being used of the Lord to influence other independent Pentecostal churches in Palawan and the Visas region amen amen now this group here is praying for a church um which they want to build on donated property the church in cagon Palawan headed by Pastor Chris mahilum is also growing in the knowledge of Our Savior Jesus Christ they have been praying for a decent place of worship to be erected on a lot that's been donated to the church pastor mahilum takes care of two congregations in the area and I thank God for ministers that are being raised up right right because we we in Manila cannot do it alone right we need reinforcement from the churches right there in Palawan amen and one of the brothers that's being raised up is brother Eddie Garbo that's right he was Regional evangelist of UPC for UPC for 14 years now he ministers to the young churches in the message to encourage the people to stay with their new found truth amen and here's another preacher that helps us in the cause we call him the singing preacher his name is brother edu mamak he influences other Pentecostal groups and new message converts with his ministry of teaching and singing he makes guitars and gives gives them away to churches that need them the guitar his is playing in this picture he made that one custom made now here's a husband and wife team but they also met this couple they were the ones baptized their names are brother Dany and sister Lisa Gomez and they work amongst the poorest of the poor of the city of Puerto Princessa they have a church in the village of sikan Puerto Princessa and they also operate a daycare center for Indigent pupils in the village this is a picture of their day daycare center this is a struggling daycare center 56 children are enrolled in this Daycare Center Pastor Gomez thought about closing it down for lack of finances and we are presently helping them with salaries of two teachers and uh some school supply and the children badly need a good uh feeding feeding program Hallelujah and we have chains we have a chain of invitations coming from different ministerial groups uh because the people talk talk about the Expos they like what they what they hear and what they what other other ministers that attended that were able to attend the expose uh report about the Expose and so now we are receiving a lot of invitations from different groups amen this is an expo seminar conduct conducted amongst Pentecostal ministers in Marina City where a dozen ministers accepted the message amen am now here's the greater challenge greater challenge is trying to convince the leaders to host the Expo seminars brother leam and milanes the one seated to the to the left far left um uh his former he was former Bishop of the Church of God Association um far left arranged this meeting with officers of Jesus's Lord Fellowship Jesus's Lord is the biggest Pentecostal charismatic organization in our country for a mystery Expo seminar with the group with with a group in the month of May we had one in the month of May the XO team with some of the attend this in the seminar in Marina now uh I have been training for about two years now uh different different ones different brothers that are interested to help out in the presentation of the message during the seminars so uh I can name at least about eight or nine brothers that are helping me now cond the Mr Expo seminar so there are times when they do it by themselves I just sit there and kind of supervise the thing and sometimes they go without me so it's a blessing amen praise the Lord Brother Armand of parang and brother Leo milanes brother Lando estaras by roria De Leon these are the brothers that that have been training to become presenters of the message brother pitagoras Koso brother Alfredo Lim and sister lolit Franco is not a is not a preacher she's not a preacher but she helps us coordinate uh the the seminars they post for a souvenir picture during lunch break at the seminar in Manina and now we're trying to Aid the newly converted ministers you see brother lto solo here handing some uh message literatures Bibles and other supplies to the uh new converts in palan our assembly helped new converts with Bibles tablets loaded with sermon outlines message and message translations acoustic guitars shoes clothes and other relief items brother this assembly gave me money to buy I forget now 25 tablets to give away to the new converts Hallelujah and here's one Expo seminar we did amongst the baptist ministers here's a photo of of one of several Expos we conducted amongst the baptist ministers in halahala the province of Ral and here's a p uh uh here's a picture of an El elderly brother am I just can't think of his name brother this brother served with three Baptist groups for a period of 44 years Hallelujah and he's just very thankful that he heard the teaching on water baptism in jesus' name and was re-baptized together with his two sons amen am amen yes brother Rael works with the uh tribal people uh especially the the T daram tribe brother Rael and his wife make a living selling Barbecue on sticks at the side of the street the couples started this church by giving giving this native T Dam food every Sunday morning no teaching they just give them food they go go there every Sunday morning and just give them food now it has grown to be a strong church with a good testimony in the village but Rael prays about improving the condition of their house of worship as you can see it's in in a very bad shape Hallelujah we want to be able to strike while the iron is hot like I said there's no place in the world where this is happening uh uh uh uh this sort of thing is happening in this revival is happening right now uh but the island of Palawan not everyone like the message that we present the ones who reject the the message are quick to spread the word around yeah we hear our names being broadcast over the radio over television you watch out for this roel Sano they're nothing but a cult leader pritter Mass pritter they call us and uh they're nothing but Brites time will come when we will not be able to conduct seminars as denominational leaders have been marking us as branhamites and cult leaders this particular group is hostile to the message being dominated by women preachers and there are big groups that want the seminar this particular full gospel group wants a big seminar to be conducted where hundreds of their Minister members will attend we are not quite ready for such an expensive Endeavor most of our sers are small groups of 30 to 50 which is cheaper and a lot more EAS to manage or handle now we we had that one where over 100 ministers attended in Puerto Princessa but that was the biggest that we had and we need to do followup on these ministers because they're very tender uh the seminars are just introdu introductory uh lectures about the message they're not really in-depth study of the message but we need to do followup uh Ministry to the new converts amen uh so I I could CET your prayers so that God would uh raise up more ministers and God would uh provide so that we can go to all the churches and be able to help these groups and for all this we want to give God all the glory and honor amen praise the Lord hallelujah okay I think it's time to uh continue the preaching this morning Hallelujah the pass the compassion of the The Compassion of the Christ part two that okay amen The Compassion of the Christ part two if you would please stand as we read the word of God in the book of St James chapter 2 verse 5-7 God chose the poor to be riched in faith how many can say Amen to that amen James chapter 2: 5-7 hearken my beloved Brethren ha not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith amen and HS of the Kingdom which he had promised to them that love him amen listen to this but ye have despised the poor right do not rich men oppress you and draw you before judgment seats do not they blaspheme the worthy Name by which by which you are called Hallelujah I certainly believe that the wealth of a person [Music] or or the people that live in a city a a particular place the wealth is inversely proportional to the spirituality of the people I mean the the more wealthy a person becomes the less and less his faith becomes you know you believe that yeah Hallelujah the last scripture I'm going I'm going to read is about leoda Revelations chapter 3: 16-1 17 so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich now this lady Zia is saying this about herself I am rich and increas with good and I have need of of nothing but God looks at her differently knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked God blesses the reading of his word you may now be seated thank you I talked to brother Louise about true compassion this morning we discuss at length uh true compassion that comes from God Amen you know we need to have not just the mind of Christ but also the heart of Christ amen and but brother bam said something about true compassion you know uh you can have compassion for let's say the uh the famous children of uh Africa children that are uh under norish or mal noris in Africa but it's different when your son or your daughter your child is the one that's hungry get it hungry there seem to be a deeper sense of compassion that you feel for the child because that's that child has a connection with you am okay because the the Africans they they're so remote you hardly feel their suffering right yeah that's right but when the one that's suffering is right in your household right amen then you really have compassion for that for that person Hallelujah and brother B said something about true compassion here in the message Jesus Christ the same yesterday them forever it says Jesus was more compassionate than any person that ever was on Earth the whole Fountain of compassion was in him and he passed the lame the Hal the the blind the withered the Bible said he did it is that scripture St John chapter 5 read it for yourself he's talking about the uh what do they call that pool the pool of Bethesda were all kinds of sick people were waiting to uh come into the water because they wanted to to be healed amen the the uh uh uh the angel appears and U uh kind of disturbs the water and the first one to to go into the water will be healed so you can just imagine maybe a 100 people around the pool of beesa were there and here comes the Lord Jesus he passes the Cancer Victim he passes the baby with hydrus yeah he passes all kinds of people with all kinds of diseases and he he comes to this one with an illness that's not even lifethreatening and he prays for this one and heals him brother bam says talk about compassion Hallelujah to me what brother vam was trying to come across when he said this is that we have to have discernment we have to have the mind of Christ because you there's there's just no way that you can help everybody every suffering person on Earth Hallelujah but you can help the one that God wants to help Hallelujah and brother benham's explanation was uh when the reason why Jesus went to this particular person was that that was who the father showed him amen Jesus did not just help anybody but he helped the one whom the father showed him and I believe this is the truth through compassion through Godly compassion when you can get the connection between the one that's suffering and God gives you the Revelation that God wants you to help that person Hallelujah well this morning uh after the preaching this morning some of you brothers and sisters came to me and and told me about your experiences about certain poor people yeah poor people that are not really poor poor people that actually uh earn more money being poor well I'm not talking about those kind of people I mean I'm talking about the poor ones that that really can't help themselves you know we have a saying in in the Philippines God helps those who help themselves no God helps those who cannot help themselves Hallelujah and uh I believe even the even those that try to deceive you even people try to deceive you they they just take advantage of you I believe we need to be willing to help them exercise discernment yes but we need to be able to help those who are asking needing help Hallelujah brother bam said don't lose the feeling for the people next slide please he said yeah don't lose the feeling for the people see you must remember that they are not made of Sodom us they are flesh and blood human beings and a soul amen they are human beings that have a soul he said this in standing in the Gap I wrote here missionary rise because I had an experience many years ago when I went to mindo I took some missionary I won't tell you which country he came from but I I I took I took the brother to the tribes you know minister to the tribal people and those tribal people they come down from the mountains where they have to work for a whole day if they're not attending the services they work for a whole day just planting and uh trying to get something to eat or earn a living so that day after the service I wanted to buy them some rice and I asked the brother brother can you help help me I'm a little short on money we need to buy rice for the people and the brother said brother roel I'm sorry but I did not come here to be buying rice for the people and he was a dynamic preacher he's a good teacher but he said I didn't come here to be buying rice for the people hallelujah where's the compassion Hallelujah here's another thing I want to show you is the body is more important than helping the poor yeah God God ordained it that we will we will have the poor always with us in the Book of Matthew chap 26: 6-1 we read here now when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment and poured it on his head as he sat at meat but notice what happened next when his disciples saw it they had indignation meaning they were upset that this this thing was happening saying to what purpose is this waste so they're looking at it as a wasteful thing you know to what purpose is this waste for this ointment Alabaster which at that time was very expensive might have been sold for much and given to the poor and when Jesus understood it he said unto them why trouble ye the woman for she said she hath wrought a a good work upon me right for listen to what he said ye have the poor always with you but me ye have not always for in that she has poured this ointment on my body and she did it for my burial am what Jesus is trying to tell us here is that the poor will always be around and we should always be willing and ready to help the poor hallelujah but the body of Jesus the body which God prepared for himself the body that suffered at the cross the body that God used to redeem all of us it has to be served service has be to be done uh to that body and in this uh in this case that body was anointed for the burial we're talking about worship here we're talking about appreciation of the body Hallelujah this is better than helping all the poor people in the world this is true compassion okay true compassion is wanting to do service for the body amen yeah wanting to help the body I hope you're spiritual enough to catch what I'm trying to say because you are part of the body right you are the body of Christ Hallelujah and anytime you help any part of the body of Christ anytime you help a suffering believer you are actually serving the body Hallelujah 2 Corinthians chapter 5 verse 10 I don't think I have it there but you're familiar with the scriptures I'm going to read it for we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ and and that everyone may receive the things done in his body we're not just talking about charitable works here we're not just talking about helping some people but things that are done to the body I understand we're going to have a communion are we are we going to have a communion today Hallelujah according that he had done whether it be good or bad right you're going to be judged by what you have done to the body of Christ Hallelujah in the Book of Luke chap 6 verse 28 and 29 it says here bless them that curse you right pray for them which despiteful of you you I think this was what the brothers and sisters were telling me about people that use people people that PR pretend to be to be suffering to be poor just to take advantage of other people right take advantage of your soft Hearts Hallelujah but you are not to supposed to curse them but bless them that curse you and pray for them that despitefully use you right that's right and unto him that Smith thee on the one Chek offer also the other and to him that taketh away the cloak forbid not to take thy coat also in other words be ready to be taken advantage off Hallelujah you do it in good faith you're doing it in service to the body it's up to them whether they take advantage of you or they squander the help that they get from you Hallelujah I wish to share this quotation with you it's a good one uh I wonder if the brother can pull it up for me uh it's the message you must be born again um well brother benam says yeah yeah that one good good brother Neville says thank you brother Brenham and I enjoy doing something this way because it is this that that helps us to be more Christlike and spiritual how many can say Amen to that it helps us to be more Christlike and spiritual sometimes people say I want you to pray for me that I will be a better Christian well I've already prayed for you now I'm going to show you how how to be one amen he said that's the way to do it and open up your bowels of compassion and I also know that brother ilot he doesn't ask for sympathy because of it but he is a crippled man and so and has been out of work so we'll just this morning open up our hearts and help the fox out helps this folk out I believe here is the offering place you see better B announce to the people that they should help this crippled person right and that is the way according to him to be a better chrisan Hallelujah is to open the bows of compassion and try to help those that are in need serve the ones that are in the body Blasphemous names 1962 but said now you might say look I sure don't like brother Neville or I sure don't like brother Jones there's a brother Jones here by the way I don't like brother so and so and something like that but just let something happen to him brother your heart is broke it just nearly kills you see we can obtain brotherly kindness and feeling for one another talk about true compassion talk about that connection that you have Hallelujah with a fellow believer a fellow member of the body of Christ right fellow seed Hallelujah fellow bride amen thank you Jesus three more slides and we're done all things araban said why do you care for your brother because you broke bread with him here at the altar as you will tonight then he said you fellowship with him you shook his hands you worship with him yeah he's your brother and he might do something in the flesh that you would disagree with because you just kind of stay which you ought not to do but shun him a little can you identify with this you sh a a brother or a sister a little because you don't like what he's doing but in the bottom of your heart but M says if something happened to that brother it would just nearly kill you or that sister I say Amen to that and then he says if you would come seeking the Holy Spirit and let him the faith that you've got in him add to that virtue and to that brotherly kindness 2 Peter 1:7 until you are built in the full stature of Christ and then the last thing is love which God the Holy Spirit seals you to your destination I'm going to read the last slide brother Braham said you cannot impersonate what am I talking about about service to the body of Christ right you cannot impersonate brotherly kindness you cannot impersonate the love that you have for the Brethren amen hallelujah you can impersonate it but I as as I said last night it's just like a black bird putting peup peacock feathers in his wings and saying see I'm a peacock yeah he just added them and pushed them in if there's something on the inside of him made him push them out he would actually be a peacock certainly but some people are trying to do something to look like somebody else or impersonate somebody else because they thought they did it and you see what it does it brings us back back to a ritual and form again it's the blood the life that electrifies and sanctifies your life that's right Hallelujah we will all come before the Judgment seat of Christ and be judged according to the things done in the body right that's right Hallelujah I believe this is true compassion right you can be compassionate to other people but most especially to people of like Precious Faith amen people that are part of the body remember you cannot impersonate it unless you have the Holy Ghost unless you have the genui agap love living in you you cannot manifest it Hallelujah you cannot have true compassion for others people that are suffering unless you have the holy spirit of God in you Hallelujah let's all stand amen and let's just sing I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to be like Christ right like better mam said I want to be a better Christian by helping my brother amen who is in need or is suffering I want to [Applause] live the way he wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to love love till there's just no more love but I can never ever out love the Lord sing it one more time I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give and I want to love love till there's just no more love but I can never ever out love the Lord one more time let's sing it one more time I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to [Music] give I want to love love till just no more love
