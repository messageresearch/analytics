uh brother Jack Duff's church Sunday and uh uh brother Jack asked me to get up greet the people so I got up and told him I said well rodell's always said blessed is the preacher who can get up and testify not preach so so that's what I did but uh we had a really good time and treated us really well and I have a wonderful group of people down there and I've got to see brother Smiley and the different ones and I gotta tell a little story uh brother Jack told him before I got there he said brother Aaron will know your names and he said don't be surprised if he'll walk something called you by your name he said he watches because I've watched the videos and they when when you get up to sing they put your name on the screen and then they have when they put all the birthdays up they put everybody's birth name up at birthdays so after a while you get kind of learned people's names and faces and everything so it's like it's not like you got discernment it's just over time you just kind of pick these things up but uh wonderful and we had a really good time and uh got to fellowship with him some and uh we got to go see the property that uh brother when brother Jack was here he was talking about the the church property that they're trying to buy and they're believing and they took us by and we got to see it and uh we were standing in the parking lot and he said brother the Aaron this is what we're believing in for by faith and we're believing for this and I told Brother Jack I said well brother I'm gonna do everything in my power to be here for the dedication so you just believe with them so brother Jack asked us just to uh continue to pray for that situation and believe I said well brother I'll certainly mention that to the church so it was God's mindful of all things and he's got it all in control whether sometimes we don't see it that way sometimes it's hard waiting but you know the greater the battle the sweeter the victory amen so if you have your Bibles tonight we go to Mark chapter four and begin at verse 35 and um just going to take a little fault this this afternoon and also want to remember and mention Levi I know y'all try to wrap your mind around this Levi graduates a week from Friday so may the 19th he's graduating from high school you wonder where all the time went but uh so anyway you're all invited it's going to be at the Memorial Stadium there in Jefferson and it starts eight o'clock so anybody's a that's uh if you'd like to go you're more than welcome to go it's open to the public so I just want to mention that to everybody so uh I still try to think about that you know they grow up on you and and then all of a sudden you got to figure out what you're gonna do and the main thing is is not try to figure these things out on your own but trust God let God lead you and so y'all just continue to pray for him pray for us and uh but I thank the Lord foramen he's grown up to be a fine young man amen so I know there's many other ones that uh be graduating I know Josiah graduated and and appreciate the Lord for that and just continue to remember all of them I know there's many others that'll be graduating and so just can Lord I just uh bless them and watch over watch over them amen I know we've got many needs tonight we're just going to look to the to the Lord before we read the scripture and so that's all about our heads our heavenly father we thank you again tonight Lord we're together in Your Name Lord in your house father you said where two or three are gathered in in the midst I'll be in the midst of them Lord so We Gather in your name here Lord Jesus because that's the only way that we can gather in you because if we just gather as as a group Lord and it has no meaning it has no reference Lord but we gather to fellowship with you Lord the Lord to look to you for what we have needed to allow you to have the preeminence Lord and father we just pray that you just come and anoint each one and Lord just come and have your willing way with us in this service take these words father and just speak to our hearts Lord the words of Life Lord that we need and Lord all the ones that that are not here the ones that are the watching in Lord whatever the needs may be you know all the needs whatever request is or whatever desire is and so father we just committed all to you in the name of Jesus Christ Lord that we know that you'll just come on the scene and and whatever the need is Lord You're the answer to it and so we just commit it to you father we thank you Lord for our brothers and sisters all around the world Lord that we're able to fellowship with just a little portion of them here and father what a great day that's going to be when Lord all this drops behind us and father we enter into a realm of Eternity Lord that we can fellowship with one another and Lord there will never be any parting there father for all the ones that have gone on Lord we know that it's a reality one of these days father we're going to see them in this Dimension again but we're not in the old bodies are not crippled or not sick and weak Lord but they're going to raise in the newness of Life father they're going to be young and an eternal vibrant what a wonderful thing that we can look to Lord Lord we just look for that day father just help us get ourselves ready Lord let us be what you'd have us be and Lord just pray for your fivefold ministry Lord the brothers that are around the world that Minister Lord Faithfully but we just continue to hold them up Lord just bless them in a special way Lord we commit all things to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Mark chapter 4 verse 35 says in the same day when even was come he'll say us unto them let us pass over unto the other side and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there were also with him other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awake him and say unto him Master Charis thou not that we perish and he arose and rebuked the wind and set unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and he said unto them why are you so fearful and how is that ye have no faith and they feared exceedingly and said to one another what manner of man is this that even the wind and the Sea obey him amen God bless your nights you can have your seats and so uh not only take this little fault on Jesus said there he said let us pass over and so that's what I want to speak on tonight let us pass over you know brother Brandon says here and he's speaking in the message calling Jesus on the same you know brother random's talking about he said so now he said now we find him knowing that he had a great job ahead of him the next day that he was going into gadera in gandero there was a maniac a man who had lost his mind and he was there living amongst the Devils cutting himself a poor man who could not call for his own help and now we find he that his own his road over there and I believe he knew all about it the father had sent him over there and he knew it and now tired and where he goes back and takes this opportunity for a little rest while the ship is crossing the sea great day and be about this time of the evening or a little later they're crossing the sea now while Jesus went back to the hinder Park back in the stern of the ship probably went into a little room back there and lay down on a pillow and while they were arresting the disciples they thought now our Day's Journey is over our work our work for him now we take our take up our own task and he said let's just start pulling the boat so that's the count you know the story there where brother Ram's talking about you know Jesus comes and you know it's interesting when you when you read this you know after all of the the Miracles and all the work that Jesus had done and all the things that the disciples had seen Jesus do all this time that he had went with them and he said the father had showed him what was taking place because he was going to gadera and here he is he gets in this boat you know he tells the disciples he said let's go over Let's cross over we're going to go over to the other side well the disciples didn't know what was taking place but you know there's one thing about brother Adam said about Jesus Jesus was a master of all his circumstances he had perfect faith and being a man of perfect Faith you know what all things was in his hands of all things that when the father had showed him all these things he didn't have any worries he didn't have any cares why because he was doing the father's will and it didn't hold him back and it's an amazing thing that when he got in that boat if he knew the if he knew that the the powers of the devil were coming against him and they were going to attack and stir up the sea and all these things well you know what it didn't bother him here's a here's a you know it's such an amazing thing he went on there picked up his pillow went in the back of the boat and laid down it's an amazing thing when you think about how he was he just went back there and laid down and the other thing I think is so amazing when I was reading this passage what stands out to me was you know in the midst of all this storm and everything and it's filling up with water and somehow you know how in the world was Jesus laying in the back of this boat asleep and all that water where he filled up the boat and you know you remember the old if you ever seen the old movies of the of the ships that were you know everything slides to one side of the boat and slides to the other side of the boat and Jesus sitting there sleeping and you know Harold they are here they are they go through all these things that that are taking place but you know Jesus wasn't worried about any of those things he didn't he didn't have any stress on him he didn't have any worries he didn't have any any doubt about what was going to take place why because if the father had seen him that he was going to heal the mate if he was going to deliver the maniac of gadera then you know what Crossing that water had no problems that was not anything that was going to stop him because he had seen where he was going and he knew what his commission was he knew what his what his what he had seen the father do and so then when the father had given him this commission to do what the father had shown him that was going to take place when he went out there to do that then you know what all the other all the other portions of this everything else was peripheral because that's not part of what God had for him because you know what if God has called you to a place and he's called you to do something then you know what no matter how many devils in Hell come against you to stop you you know what you're still going to do what God has called you to do because you know the only thing that stops US Is Us we stop ourselves because if we will sit and listen to what the devil has to say then that's what hinders us but it doesn't hinder us if we follow what God has said now it may slow us down and we may have to take a different route or whatever but you know what we still go the same way we still overcome so here when we see how they're they're writing on riding this boat and here they are and brother Brown continues on and he says he said now then we see those things and have them thoroughly examined identified certainly he said then why do we get scared when trouble comes in and so he continues on he says now look now we got troubles that we can't remedy he said because he was speaking of the of the disciples he said well they tried their sales and the wind was too hard it blew them off they tried their oars and the waves were so great it broke the horse then they got in their their little ship so let it drive it was let drive they probably tied the Keel down in the rudder and when they did they just let it drive just any way it would go and it dashing and splashing he said you have to ride a wave in a boat he said you fellas in a boat that ride a boat you know you just can't face right into a wind like that right into the wave if you do you'll pitch your boat right up at the bottom so you've got to guide that boat let it roll with the wave as the waves roll you roll right in and out with it when you if you don't he's you're you'll feel your boat full of water so here they are in this great storm that comes up and they're trying to handle it in their selves they're trying to do what they can do and here they are in this massive storm and here's all this water and they're trying to fight and trying to manage this boat and try to control it and all of a sudden they realize you know what there's no I have no control over this everything that I have is is useless because you know brother I'm talked about Peter and them you know they were fishermen they grew up on the sea so they were they weren't rookies they weren't novices they knew they were you know very experienced men and here they are in a storm and everything that they've done is is worthless it has no power they have no control over this and here they are in this boat going up and down in the water right and it's starting to fill up with water and then after all these things he said well after everything had broke and they couldn't hold on no more then they just let it drive and then when they did the boat filled up they said it looked like all hopes was gone and there they was all troubled and scared he said what a time it was it was a it was a trouble that they could not remedy anymore then Fair set in when they found out they couldn't remedy yet and he said we've hit likewise trouble we hit trouble he said we've got National troubles that are that our nation can't remedy so we live in a nation just like them so this situation that they were in when they got to the place that they realized they were not in control anymore they had no control over there's nothing that they can do to control this situation they can't help this situation because everything that they've done has failed and here they are in this and that and so they think they lost all hope and they don't have nothing there's no way that they can overcome this situation here they are in this and they're like well you know how are we going to handle this and you know and brother Brian was talking about here you know and it begins to talk about the the condition that the nation is in and he said you know we can't control the things that takes place out here why because we realize that the nation is under a curse of God and it's in the plan of God and it's going the way that God has for it and there's nothing you can do about it because you know but we know there is a way out there is a way that of Escape that's made for us why because that is not our our future that is not that is not what's been termed determined for us but we have a goal to get out of here there is a way of Escape made because when all of the of the world is trying to hold on and trying to Sure up what they can there's only one thing that you can do is make sure that you're sure on the Rock of Ages because if you're not holding on to him because you know as brother random said brother brother Branham did you hold on to your religion when all the troubles and trials in your life when you lost your wife and you lost your child and everything else fell apart he's like no it me so the thing is when we get into Christ Christ gets into us and you know what that he's holding us because you know I can't hold on but praise God he held on he said God didn't look to see if I held on he said he looks to see if Christ held on him he said he was the one that was examined and if he was the if he was the sacrifice if he was the lamb that was that was examined and if he makes the Mark if he is the one that satisfies the conditions and you know I don't have to worry about it because he's the one that met the conditions that he that he fulfilled the the requirements of God when you know in in the scripture there when when Jesus said it is finished hanging on the cross when he said it is finished you know there's three that the word in the Greek there means means three things when you say it is finished what Jesus said it means there's three things that it means number one it means the end of a battle it means the victory of a battle number two it means a debt is paid in full and number three it means that a judgment is settled in court what Jesus said so the word in Greek when Jesus said it is finished he is identifying that he was that he was the victory because he got the victory the the case that was against us was settled and the debt that we owed was paid so when he said it's finished then you know what that all we have to do is accept that because departing has been given to us but all we've got to do is accept the pardon that's been given to us so tonight you know we we're we're the recipients of that why because as the scripture says we've been made more than conquerors through him why because he's the one that overcame he was the Conqueror and he allowed us to step into that so when he that he made the way and all we're doing is going in the way that he's made then all I've got to do is follow him then it makes me an overcomer but so when we stand in those things we realize there's things that we can't remedy there's troubles that we have but praise God we know the answer we know the one who's got the answer we know the one that's going to make the way amen and praise God that we as brother Ernie Villanueva used to say all the time we've got tomorrow's headlines today we already know what's going to take place we've already got we've already got a place to stand on the Rock of Ages we've already got and we can hide in the cleft of The Rock and we can be safe and secure where we stand man says the troubles we can't we can't remedy he said the thing is sin unbelieving evil he said it's just weeded into US growed around us wrapped the whole nation in it say all of these troubles the way things are going today you know anything that's anything that's good is called Bad everything is bad is good yeah and anytime you have any time you have a moral stand don't don't try to have any kind of uh morals stand about you and people come up why do you why do you believe the way that you do why do you believe that well you know what you know God's just love and God is love and you know what we just we just love everybody and just do whatever we want to because you know what there's no repercussions I was like what kind of world do you live in oh all right bro okay well it's like well I want you to climb under a ladder and I'm gonna take a five pound of hamburger and I'm gonna stand on top of the ladder I'm gonna drop it and and we'll see what happens well there's a law called gravity and if you stand right there that five pounds is going to be on the top of your head well you can't just wish that away well that don't exist well you know what it's still going to work every single time and so if you go out and you know you you get out I was thinking about brother Kern cutting the cutting the Hedge a week or so ago you know and then you know he was if y'all if y'all saw his finger you know if you if you're not on a firm foundation when things get a little wobbly next thing you know you get cut and all that you know all the things that take place you know if you go flying down the road Hey listen you get in your vehicle and go down the road just as fast you can and one of Georgia's finest along the way is going to catch you but you know it's like there's no con there's no consequences well yes there is don't pay your taxes and see what happens somewhere along the way somebody's going to come and want to talk to you why because there's rules there's laws and so and yeah and just like and God has rules and God has laws that he has set in place and you know what you're not going to get away and get by with those things God God has a way that say it I was talking to a man the other day and and we were talking about uh the scriptures and and so we were we were discussing about about our church and and you know sometimes when you tell our Church's Name Is Spoken Word Church people think that's odd you know it's like I told him I said well listen I said do you know where the where that comes from I said you tell me someplace I said when Jesus spoke he said if you say to this mountain be thou removed I said in Genesis 1 God spoke and said let there be and creation took place and salvation is made by confessing your your faults and your sins when you believe in your heart and confess with your mouth I said when God spoke to all the prophets in the Old Testament he told them speak son of man I said God never chose the son to preach the gospel he said he never spoke he never calls the wind or the waves or anything else to to create you know to uh Worship the Lord to preach the gospel none of that ever come through any other way I said man was given that we were made in the image of God and God wants us to speak and so if you're going to if because the only way that you're ever going to know God is through a human because God is in us to make the make himself known to the world he said because he said we are the light of the world and so you know what it's not it's not just not just getting out and trying to speak it but your life ought to manifests that now when people see that something comes out of your mouth it speaks to them and then he's like this is something different I said all of the Bible is based on speaking I said because it was the spoken word I said when Jesus stood there one day and he spoke to a tree and he said because it had leaves on it but it had no figs on it because when it was supposed to had figs it didn't so it was just a make-believer see it was just putting on it was just acting because it should have had figs but it didn't and when when Jesus saw that he said let no man eat of you ever again and the thing dried up and the next time Peter saw that tree he's like Lord look the tree's dried up why because Jesus believed in what he had to say and when he spoke to the tree it obeyed him and I said it's the same way with you and I I said why is it that when people come in this in this plant you see people come through the door I said some people they hate being here and every time you try to talk to them they I mean they look like they've been eating a bunch of green Persimmons when they come through the door and you hate to even be around them I said what do you see me do I said when I get here what do I do most of the time when I get up there if I'm not one holding the door I let everybody else in and everybody that passed his man good morning good morning how you all doing how you doing good morning and I speak to everybody why because you know what that's what creates a good day because you know what you create the atmosphere that you live in now you can be upset and just blow up like a bullfrog eating Buckshot and all that but you know what or you can create the atmosphere that you live in you can't control the environment that you live in but you can create the atmosphere and I was like you know what I want people to see Jesus Christ in me I want to say that there's joy unspeakable and full of Glory you know you know even when things get upset you know sometimes we have to walk off and you know we gotta we gotta pray through sometimes because you know what things get under our skin but you know what there's still a time that you know what because of that because God is an overcomer and he's inside of us and we can overcome these things that you know I want people to say that God is real that God is still alive and that he's still molding a group of people in his mind Into His Image in his character because the world can see all kinds of fakes and they can see all kinds of unbelievers and they can say all kinds but I want the World to See Jesus Christ [Applause] he said he said we tried to introduce the word Christ tried to bring the word tried to bring it back by showing himself the resurrection for 2 000 years he is still the same they turned their back upon it walked away they're unbelievers he said May Believers still hold hang on to find a fault with it just as much as they can on and on but what is it it's the same thing repeating again so what he's talking about the way it was back then he said there was three kinds of believers they were the make-believers the unbelievers but there was a real group of Believers a genuine Believers that actually believed in that and you know what when I read that it's like Lord you know because some people you know unbelievers they're not ever going to believe and it doesn't matter what you do whatever you say whatever you show them they're never going to believe that and you can't change them no matter what because God's tried to change him and he couldn't so you're not gonna do it but that's what struck me when he said make believers still hang on to find a fault with it and it is what that's what struck me you know here's my eight Believers what well I'm still hanging I'm around but what was it that was a mixed multitude that was with Israel and you know what they didn't have any good thing to say about anything you know it's amazing if if you're a real genuine True Believer and you actually believe that this is what God has sent us to do and this is the workings of the holy spirit it's like you can't find anything good to say and all you can do is find fault then you know what that's not the Holy Spirit speaking because you know what when everything goes wrong whenever there's problems you know what that's what that is part of the life that's part of as brother Ram said that's life's grab bag you're gonna have all these issues and problems and everything but you know what greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world so if we have all these problems then Lord let us not just find fault with it I know there's I know there's problems and we've all got problems and there's always problems but Lord let us find something to be thankful for yeah you know I was I was speaking to that man I was telling you about where he's talking about the word and and whereas I was telling him I was like well you know I was like when you're raising children I said when you get out there I said the one thing you don't do I said and you're a coach you coach best the man coaches basketball I said when you get out there I said how well do you think your team's going to perform us I all you can do is find thought with everything they do if you pull them on the sideline you didn't do this right you didn't do that this and that and but what do you got to do you got to reinforce the things that are correct when you raise children what do you got to do you got to tell listen you're doing good right now well you got to correct the things that are wrong but you know what you got to create them but you want them to understand this is the reason why we do this but you want to praise him when they're doing good you want to encourage them how many times when because how many times has the Lord spoke to you and gave you a word of encouragement even in the midst of of sicknesses or heartaches or problems or whatever and the Lord comes and brings you a word of comfort a word of encouragement and it might have been just one word that he speaks but you know what it'll change your whole life just by that one why that one little minute and it's the same way it's by you speaking to your children and if you encourage them to go that way then you know what they'll get better if you have a team and you encourage them you know what they get better because you know what if they don't if you don't think they are ever do anything right or you know then whether they wanted they don't want to continue right right he's like well it's time to give up but God don't want us to give up he wants us to keep going just a little while a little longer just a little while to stay here just a little bit longer than we we can leave it won't be much longer just hold on he said in the midst of idolatry in the midst of worldlyism in the midst of all kinds of confusions and mix up we still have him in the ship stay still in all this he's still in the ship with us he said no wonder David screamed out I'll feel no evil for you're in the ship hey man oh how they could see this so much that they had seen was not able to express it all of what they had seen he said now it dawned on them that he was laying right close to them and it says now he is a lot closer to you than he was then is that right so in the midst of all these problems and everything as they were in this ship and they were looking at this storm and how great it was and all the problems and everything that they were facing and you know after they had tried everything and they'd lost almost all their hope and you know they had no other way to turn then all of a sudden they wrote oh you know what Jesus is on the boat here's Jesus and brother I'm talking about in all the midst of all this he said it dawned on them but he said you know what for y'all to understand for us to understand you know he's closer tonight to us than he was to them why because he's taking up residence in us so he is and then he said I'll never leave you don't forsake you but I'll be with you even in you under the end of the world so if he's here then guess what in the midst of all the chaos and the confusion and all the worldlyism and all the things that are happening all around us praise God we've got a way to go we know which way to go because we've got to Anchor this steadfast ensure that's going to lead us the way [Music] I'm so glad that we have a place to stand and we don't have to worry about these things God's leading us see if we understand in the midst of all the things that have taken place so you know all these things that that have come against us God is still real he said I'm with you now and I will be with you he said a little while in the world will see me no more yet ye shall see me what because on the day of Pentecost when they stood there and they saw Jesus walking and speaking they didn't understand everything that Jesus said it was a lot of things they didn't understand but what did they say what did Peter say Lord to whom shall we go when there's no other place to go Lord we don't understand these things but we know that you have the words of eternal life and there's no other place to go and he began to encourage the disciples and he told Peter he said he said when he said the Satan has desired to sift you like wheat see Satan's coming against you he said but I've prayed for you and he kept encouraging Peter he said listen he said when you're converted he said strengthen the brethren why because he knew that through the Battles Through the heartaches and all the things that Peter would go through then he would be a testimony he would be a witness to the things that God had done and he could go out there and tell the brothers listen don't be weary in well-doing don't worry about all these things because God is is a is a god of Mercy he's a god of Grace and he's leading us on and he's going to take you all the way when Peter could stand there and tell the early church and you know when he could give his testimony and say listen I walked with him I slept with him I I ate with him I've seen all these Miracles and you know what I turned my back on him but you know what praise God he didn't turn his back on me and you know what he began the top one Peter began to tell about his will about his testimony when he'd been begin to talk about the things that he had witnessed in his life and understanding the grace of Jesus Christ and what God meant to him because what had God had done for him where he had come from and where he come to he's like listen y'all can come the same way when when Paul can stand there and talk about being a being complicit in the murder of Christians when his brothers and sisters that had died and you know what he had their blood on his hands because he was complicit in that in that act and he could stand there and tell them but you know what he said but the grace of God covers Us Hallelujah and so what brothers and sisters if you if you can believe that the grace of God will cover you too the grace of God covers all of us and you know what if we fall down praise God because there's a way to get back up and come back into fellowship and divine fellowship with God that we can continue on God did make us quitters God didn't quit on you so let's don't quit on him and say Lord I can't make it well praise God because in in our weakness his strength is made perfect we've got perfect strength when we realize we can't do it ourselves when we come to the place to realize just as they did you know what we've got Jesus on our ship and if we can just turn to him and say Lord this is what we have need of Lord do you care not that we perish well you know what he wasn't worried about it why because he was the god of creation and he was standing there and he was not worried about it he said I think it's time when troubles come on that we say to those decide like those disciples who must have said let's go wait Kim Let's Go call him let's call him on the scene he said oh my beloved brother my beloved sister I love you and remember I'm telling you the truth if you've got trouble tonight he's right at hand he has caught he can be called on the scene just by by just a move of your lips see that's what I was when I was talking to that man about speaking see if we just speak it he'll come on the scene he's wanting us to make that invitation he will come on the scene amen call Jesus on the scene wake Jesus for we have him with us he is the same yesterday today and forever So He is wanting us to come in because he desires to have fellowship with us so he's there and he's closer than he was back then what is it then then it's us if we will have fellowship with him he desires us to have Fellowship you know his brother Bosworth told brother Brandon said well you know what is fellowship it's Two Fellas in one ship well he's on the ship with you and everything else is going wrong then you know what he wants you to have fellowship with him and tell him Lord I can't get through this do you see what's going on but you know he wasn't worried about what was going on because in the midst of that storm he just got up out of that out of that little room off the bed and you know what and here's this great massive storm and no you know the boats pitching every different direction but you know he just walked calmly to the front of that boat and of all that pitching and everything going on he just kept going walked right up there and put his foot on the front of that boat and said peace be still that's all he said he didn't you know he didn't get down and pray and he didn't he wasn't in all this kind of thing you know he just spoke to the storm and it's and it ceased yeah in the midst of all that you know then he he turned to the disciples and told him he said now listen he said and in the midst of all this and you've seen all because here he is he's trying to get them to understand they've seen all the Miracles that that has taken place all the you know the Dead's been raised the the feeling of all you know the you know the thousands or whatever all the Miracles that's taking place he knows the secrets of people's hearts all the things that Jesus has done and he's speaking to them and you know all the things that they've seen up to them and it's like why are you so fearful and you have no faith because you've come all this way and you've seen all these things but you identify me as the one that was back there with Moses it's like Peter your your dad Peter and and Andrew y'all's dad was talking about uh the great Jehovah of the Old Testament and you know you you've heard the the Scrolls read in the prophets and and all those things that you've you've read all the all your life and you've heard all the Miracles that God done and you identify me as that and and so here I am in in flesh I'm the one that's in flesh that was spoken of back there because that's who you identify me as the Messiah the word made flesh that you that well you said you said you believe what Isaiah said Jeremiah Moses Joshua David well if I'm the Fulfillment of that I'm standing in your midst why are you why are you not believing this oh man if I if I was down there around the walls of Jericho I would have just been marching knowing there was a great Victory coming well you know what there was a great victory in front of them they didn't they went up there rejoicing they didn't rejoice in the fact that they were about ready to look like that boat was about ready to go into in the sea well well you know what we we believe David that Daniel he was a man of God he was a prophet of God he had the word of God and you know what he went in that Lion's Den and he was there facing those hungry lands but you know what the angel of the Lord was there with him and you know what the Lord brought him out well if the Lord brought him out then why is it that the same God that was back there is the same God that stands before us and we don't have faith in what he believed and what he said we don't believe what he said it's just like well if that's the same that he's the same because the Bible says he's the same yesterday today and forever so if that was if that was true back there that it's true right here and here he is speaking to him he said why is it that y'all are so fearful and have no faith to believe because of the things you've seen the things that you've read if you begin to identify this ministry as the Fulfillment of the Old Testament of the law of the prophecies then how is it you can't believe what's taken place when it stands in your midst and if you can believe this it's like wow what manner of man is this that even the winds and see obey him why because there's you know because when you know brother Ram says you know God wants us to believe for big things and you know sometimes when when you know when it's small things you know what what we got we got faith hey we can believe that but you know what when things get a little bit tougher and the things get a little bit bigger then you know what our faith is being tried with sometimes our faith begins to waver on on the bigger things and when it becomes even bigger trials then we have we have well you know I I want to believe but it's harder to believe because you know but God wants us to believe in the big things he wants to ask for the big things he wants to ask for great things it's like well I don't I don't I don't know no God wants you to try him because you know what he tries you he brings things along your path and he wants to see if you believe him what you're going to do is that is that what he said about coming up the stature you're coming up to certain things in your life and you know he's going to try you see where you stand why because that's that's how you that's how you grow as child rearing bringing you up well do you have confidence in what God will do it's like well I don't I don't I don't see I don't see a way out well praise God you ain't you ain't found the Waymaker here is the Waymaker he's like well if we could just come to a place to realize that he's here and he wants to make a way for you he wants to show you there's a way out there's a way of Deliverance whatever you ask for he's there to meet your need now the problem is is sometimes when we get to that place where you say well you know we want God to do it the way we want it done and we want it done when we want it done and the problem is is God's not going to do that God's going to do it his own time and praise God you know there's been times in my life you know I'm glad that God didn't answer my prayers because you know what I found out you know what I had I had it all miscalculated because God knew more about it than I did and he's like well Lord I'm just going I'm just going to trust you because I realize that that I'm inadequate in this situation but you know he's got it all in control brother Ryan says I wonder today brother he said if we're failing to recognize yet Among Us the Holy Spirit he said I wonder if the people in our attitude today if we don't fail to recognize that this is the Holy Spirit that the holy spirit is Among Us President says if we can only realize that he is here with us the same yesterday today and forever he said lo I Am With You Always I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'm with you to the end of the world is that 24th chapter he said I'll never leave you again he said oh again I will never leave you nor forsake you I am I was just looking at the scripture I had wrote down here concerning it he said how can we be sure by his proven word he is now waiting for you to call him on the scene to be proved so let us go and wake Jesus on our lives he said how do you awake Christ by believing his word faith brings him on the scene that's what brings him on the same faith then call him and call on him to confirm his word and don't doubt in fear don't do that just believe him as as it is written and let it be done and God will prove to you that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he said we worship an invisible God amen if we can believe what God has said he's here and all that he said is yours he said it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom whatever you exit he said he would not withhold any good thing to those that walk uprightly and you know and you say well brother Aaron I got this problem I got that problem well guess what God's made a way he has a provision for you to come back into Divine Fellowship if you're not in fellowship with God then we know who's out of position but you know what he's made a way and he's here for you to call on him and say Lord I want to come back in Fellowship Lord I don't want to be cold in the spirit Lord I don't want I don't want to be bound by these same things there are certain situations in my life that I can't Advance Beyond this point and Lord I'm just like the disciples on that ship getting kicked around and I can't stay where I'm at I have no control over this situation but you know what he's on the scene for you to call on and if you will call on him he'll come on the scene and he will whatever has to be done they say Lord I'm just going to turn it over to you then you know what he's on the scene to work miracles to change lives to deliver to fill what the Holy Spirit whatever you have need of healing in your body there ain't no there ain't no big things in little things in God it's all the same why because when he when he died and he made a provision he covered all sin he healed all sicknesses he healed all diseases wow well he took when he took the the keys from Satan and he took over the whole Kingdom then you know what there's not a single one of them down there that's got any kind of power that that because it's permitted of God allows them and so you know what there's nothing out of cater with God and if you and I can just put our trust in him and as Jesus said let us pass over and go to the other side because that's our desire to get out of here because there's a better land waiting than where we're at tonight and that's my desire well God bless you let's all stand we'll have the musicians come on I'm gonna try to sing a song I don't know if anybody knows it but uh I'm gonna try to sing when Moses let Israel he led him through the Red Sea the Lord said have courage and leave it to me I will not forsake you I will hold to your hand and I'll help
