something you know and all and trying to get that arranged so we just pray the Lord would bless remember that remember the uh Easter Gathering is on the 18th is that right the Easter Gathering will be

together with us have a good time it'll be on the Saturday and we're just having some fellowship together you know there as we kind of eat together and play around together for a little while in the afternoon okay any other announcements I always remiss but we are planning a Fourth of July like I said to be that because that'll be our 4th of July 1971 we started the church here so that will be 40 something years that will'll be going and I think officially this would be the 40th year of me as Pastor CU I took over in uh 75 best I can remember but anyhow just remember that just saying a few words till everybody gets in okay so let's just sing Open the Eyes of My Heart as Wade comes to minister the word of the Lord unto us this day all right remember now it's your money that helped him to go amen all right so then that way you got a part to do with it when you see it you got a part to do it with it all right Open the Eyes of My Heart Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see Glory I want to see Open the Eyes of My My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see amen I want to see you to see you high and lifted up shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love As

Holy Holy Holy yes you're holy holy holy I want to see you amen turn around Shake somebody's hand and say God bless you good to see you this morning God bless you God bless you good to see you this morning God bless you good God bless you Richard good to see you this morning bless you good to see you this morning good to see you this morning Reverend all these people with these Ties on look hey no ties no ties no ties bless you somebody Benny says I had on my pajamas but I'm going to tell you something the Bible doesn't say we're going to wear ties in heaven it says we're going to wear robes so we're going to be wearing robes so get used to it for those of you that have a problem with the not wearing a tie this is called a baron and there's nothing wrong with a baron it's comfortable brother Lis has got a one too that in the Philippines this is considered a a sharp dress tuxedo almost you know so um yeah they're catching on them ties are yolks of bondage is what I call them so I don't like any Yol of bondage that's for sure but uh in an environment when it's hot you don't want to wear it tie over there because buddy you will overheat so uh you'll notice on one of the videos that I did wear it one or the slide I did wear it one time and I was soaking wet when I finished so I quit wearing the tie I uh sister Gail gave a bunch and we left them over there and they wear them but uh most of the time you'll see them with these things on so good to be in the house of the Lord good to be back good to see all of you here if you have your Bibles let's turn to the book of Ephesians I was trying to find something to read morning that would um that would be helpful maybe to uh to kind of forward what I'm what we're going to speak on today so and we're not going to really speak on anything we're going to read this one scripture and then we're going to go to the U to the presentation um I want to thank you all again uh very much like brother Dale said you took care of the needs over there you took care of my needs financially while I was gone because I didn't work so all the money that you poured in that come from all the different places was used for the glory of God it was not used feverously and it was not used for junk it was used for um gas travel you know helping the brothers out with u meals and uh if you'll notice we ate at several places and and you know me I I'm like brother Dale I don't announce anything so I just I would go in their kitchen and while there's nobody there and i' I'd put a th000 pesos under something so they'll find it when I'm gone you know instead of instead of finding it then I just either tack it on a refrigerator or slide it under a a fruit jar or something and when we'd leave they'd find it later on so it helped them out their exchange rate is 44 to1 so it's 44 pesos to one of our dollars so 1,000 pesos is uh it's a good wage for them their their average wage is about about $10 a day American average $10 not good but you know what they survive God takes care of them so before we get started let's uhu let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we pray Lord today that you would be the preeminent speaker in this service Lord that you would be the one that does the hearing also Lord and may the brothers and sisters of this congregation and that are watching online Lord that you would bless them Lord and show them today that the money that that sometimes is hard even excuse me hard for us to find in America that it does go to a good cause and what little we do put together is big in other places we seem like sometimes we're insignificant Lord but you said the least in the kingdom is greater than John the Baptist so the least that we give Lord is greater in the kingdom of God we ask just bless today be with us sanctify us for this journey bless us take care of us heal the sick bless the ones that are not here the ones that are that are sick be Brother Gary Lord and bless him take care of each one father just raise us up for your honor and glory in Jesus name amen Ephesians 6:1 we'll just read this to to maybe get us started finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day which is today obviously and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loin G about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace after all taking the shield of faith above all taking the shield of Faith where with you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints and for me that utterance may be given unto me that I may open my mouth boldly that sounds like me does it to make known The Mystery of the Gospel not just to open my mouth but to make known The Mystery of the gospel for which I am an ambassador in bonds that therein I may speak boldly as I ought to speak but that ye also this is what got me right here that for you but that ye Also may know my Affairs what Paul's doing he's writing a letter telling what he's doing in other places all right that that ye Also may know my Affairs and how I do tycus a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord shall make known to you all things whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose that you might know our Affairs and that you might be you might that he might Comfort your heart amen but you'll know my Affairs so you're going to know today the Affairs of what happened while we were in the Philippines you may be seated in the Lord at is blessing to the reading of the word we've got um uh I don't some of you how many of you got the um the overview from Brother Vernon uh if you did not uh brother Terence has got some that you can read it was his firsthand account of some of the things that went on over there amen and uh I I'm I'm hoping maybe brother Joe can put it online so the people can can see it and we do have I sent brother uh Danny and and brother Nester and brother Vernon and um brother Royale I sent them an email last night and brother Danny emailed back and said they're going to be watching in so it's 20 minutes till 11: at night over there so you got to remember it took me about 3 days for my body to get used to because at 12:00 during the day here it was 12:00 midnight over there so it takes your body just a little bit of time to um uh to get acclimated because when I arrived it took about 3 days and on about third third or fourth day I crashed and uh then I got caught up and everything was fine so the same thing when I got back here so thank you again for for giving your support your money and most of all your prayers amen and taking care of June while I was gone so that's the longest we ever been longest we've ever been apart from each other sister Gail since we've been married so uh I think the longest was like 10 days in Jamaica was the longest we'd everever been away from each other so uh and then I don't know if she might have been with me those 10 days that we that we went to uh to Jamaica but um it was a wonderful trip um upon arrival most of you know my luggage got lost it just didn't get stuck it got lost and thank god sister Mila wherever she is helped to find the thing cuz they had I had to describe the luggage they had to find it put a tag on it I got it 6 days later so um but that's all right I got it and that's really where all this came about because brother Dale there you go brother Dale he had got three or four of these Baron when he was over there well they were in that suitcase so we had to go to the mall and everything's a mall over there it's there's no Standalone stores everything's in like a four deck or six deck Mall there's 400 and something shops in those malls 10 and something restaurants and one mall so we went to a mall and bought these uh Baron and uh and used them so I got so used to them I didn't care if I got my luggies back tonight cuz they had all the ties and all that Yol of bondage and all that stuff in them so some of that stuff I really didn't want to see again but um uh before we get started I know that um uh brother Joe and some of the others and I have been talking and um cuz he's the one that that pretty much set this up for me cuz uh I can't do it all like that but he's he's real good he and brother Luis and all those brother I just thank God for all of them that that can do that but the one of the questions was and I want to get to get started I want to tell you that you're going to see these four Central churches that are brother roels brother Nester brother Danny del mundo now they've all been here and brother um Vernon their churches are going to be the nice big churches all right but now remember they are in what they call Metro Manila where there's 15 million people 15 million people listen I will never complain about the Atlanta traffic ever again we come in one Friday night Regina Marty ain't got nothing on these people you know Marty you see Marty going by Atlanta every once in a while there might be 30 40 people on it there's 400 people in each one of them cars and it looks like they got their face masked up against the and and then we were driving along and I looked down and there was a a white line was right in the middle of brother Vernon's car and I said are you in a lane he said somewhat it was five Lanes of traffic but there was five Lanes but there was six Lanes of cars then sister Anna there was motorcycles weaving in and out of every one of those cars I'm telling you those guys could run a road course over here and win every race they never hit a car we never saw one accident and they don't believe in turn signals or traffic lights I asked one guy that was driving for me I said John that that light was red he said what light I said John that light was red he said oh that means go so but you have and I mean you have to be an aggressive driver I told him I said the two things if I ever lived over there I would be a brake mechanic and a horn and somebody work on Horns cuz that's the two things they use the most is horns and brakes cuz if you may be those six lanes over if you need to be over here well you'll eventually you're going to get over there so you just drive yourself over there you know people stop and usually they don't blow the horn like we do over here in America and give them the one finger wave usually that is I'm coming through you know be cautious I'm coming through so they they beat but but these four churches there's 15 million people in metro Manilla and that's about the area of 285 in Atlanta now we know the traffic in Atlanta is bad and there's only like a million people in Atlanta probably two or three million maybe in the perimeter but you put 15 million people in one place place they told me they said when I got there asked brother burner and I said how far is it to brother so and so's church he said well it's only about 20 km which is close to 10 miles I said he's that close he said no brother it take an hour and a half to get there 10 miles you literally run 10 miles an hour and that's basically the only time we ever didn't have traffic was at 12:00 at night and it was about like Atlanta then but most the other other time it's it's horrible traffic is terrible but they're used to it I mean they're used to it and their churches can be 20 mil apart and have 400 people attend the church and you never have they never cross CU you can't get from one Church to the other for you know a couple hours traffic so these four Central churches to me I I was I was trying to explain to some people because you're going to see those churches are really nice churches and they've got several hundred people in their Cong ation then you're going to see some churches that are smaller churches that are um some are bamboo some are made out of tin some are made out of just curtains but if you didn't have those four Central churches that were so mission-minded like brother Danny and brother Vernon brother roel and brother Nester they they take what they have and they forward the gospel from those four churches and they're kind of the pillars of of uh you know if you didn't in other words if you didn't have them you may not have those churches out in the outskirts because they are very mission-minded they they do not live above their means they uh uh a lot of them live in the building where the church is like brother Danny he lives underneath his church and brother Nestor lives in his church you know the church is up here in his house is behind so um some of the the other ones I didn't get to go to brother Vernon or brother roels but they're you know they're all very frugal with what they do so you're going to see four churches that are nice really nice but they have to be in order to number one accommodate all the people that go to the church but even if you have four or 500 people go to your church over there you got to remember that a church this size in America would there would be more net tithe in a church this size than there would for 400 people over there cuz if their average rate is $10 a day if they pay tithe on $10 a day that's only $50 a work week that's only $5 okay so it's not like us that make you know four five 6 7 $800 a week where we can forward more than that our 10% so they do need help they they need help but you know there's one thing for sure I know brother Dale and I have been to different places uh in other countries and not one time in the Philippines not one did anyone come to me and say I have a need I need this I need that because in other places you go to a meeting especially with 40 or 50 or 60 pastors and they're always wanting something so that did not happen in the Philippines they they sure we're going to present some needs but it was always presented from the pastor or from someone working in that area not from a lay member coming up and say hey I need $20 for food they do they do eat okay I eat a lot of rice and then when I got finished and tired of eating rice we ate rice then I thought one day Christine we were going to eat dessert we had rice pudding it was flavored but it was more like [Music] eating um the cocking around the windows so but it was good I mean it tasted good but you just had to it lasts a long time it's almost like chewing gum you know you can chew it for a little while but but you know what though that's that's what they raise they raise a lot of rice and rice is is a staple over there and um and I did eat squid and turtle we not say any more about that and we did eat duck and several other things there were some things that they were very well brother brother Vernon's wife uh helped me one day because I saw something that looks so good and I said man I want some of that she said no you don't want that I said really I said looks good she said brother it was cooked in blood so it was it was not it looked good but it wasn't it wasn't going to be good when I tasted it she said you really don't want that so we went some got something somewhere else so they really took took care of me I was not sick one moment the whole three weeks but when I got off the plane I had diarrhea for three days so but that's all right I asked God to take care of me over there you know so I asked him to uh for me not to be sick and and and we were mindful of things you know that brother Joe Green helped me a lot uh and brother do Jackson CU they had just returned from there in December and they said don't drink the water which I knew not to do that we drank bottle water but they made a mistake one day and they drank a fruit drink but the ice was the ice from the tap of the house it was the ice and it made him sick so you kind of have to be mindful and and you always ask them is this filtered water and they'll say yes or no cuz they'll tell you they don't want you to get sick I mean they they'll tell you that and I'll tell you I'll give you a testimony to the Lord I uh got in a motel that night first first night we arrived brother Vernon got me in the motel and of course you know all of us we brush our teeth you know we get our teeth and then we tap water you know you get a glass of tap water and you wash your mouth out and then you drink the rest of it well stupid me well no ignorant me cuz this is a story behind this ignorant me goes into into the uh bathroom and brush my teeth fill a full glass of water up out of the tap in the bathroom and drank every drop of it so I walked into into the uh into the room and I sat down and I said what did you just do you just drank what they told you not to drink out of the tap at a at a motel so I said Lord there was a time in the Bible that there was an ignorance offering a sheo in the book of Deuteronomy I think or Exodus there was a sheo offering for ignorance so I said I plead ignorance on this one and brother uh brother Vernon or one of them he I told him that the next day he said well he said if you'd have done it twice he said that would have been stupid and he said there's no offering for stupid or stupidity he Ain call me stupid there's no offering for stupidity he there is an offering for ignorance but there's not an offering for stupidity so I didn't do it twice I just did it one time and and it never bothered bothered me a bit so so everything went everything went really well uh but those four Central churches are the biggest economy they're in the biggest economy areas and let me just tell you a little bit about the economy before we get started we were and I got two services to do this so if I bore you you can sleep and then we'll finish it this evening but we go to this place called Jolly Be and jolly be is the same as a McDonald's but it's a it's Philippine owned it's a hamburger joint all right and so we walk up to the porch and there's like 30 people look look to be probably 20 years old sitting so we go right through them and everywhere there's security guards everywhere there's a security guard I mean there's even a security guard at the sock counter at at the place where we bought our socks but um we go right on in and I asked the brothers I said what are these people waiting on are we in line you know were they in line did we break the line you know and brother royel said no brother said they're waiting for a job interview you have to have a 2year college degree to even to even be considered to work at a place called M like McDonald's all those 30 people had a 2-year college degree and was looking for a job making $10 a day they won't consider no one else no one else you have to have a 2-year college degree that's why they all look like they were 20 years old cuz they were in two years college and they would take them in five at a time and interview them and um so you know that's the economy over there sure there are some good things God does take care of his own kids amen and that's why you're going to see that those four Central churches or the bigger churches they have the more teachers and security guards and people like that doctors that can that can take take care of some of the offering that goes out in the other places if you didn't have those four Central locations then it would be worse than it is so we thank God for those four brothers and and the four pillars I call them of the uh of the Philippines and I know there's more people over there but those four I know are mission-minded and they do they forward the work of the mission all right so uh the accommodations you know you saw some of the accommodations they were very good they were very very nice and uh we did get to go to a bee farm I know you may saw some of that but got talk to a beekeeper for a couple hours and learned some things from him and and all that so but the first place we went to we come up here to this is the arrival and uh for those of you that don't know who these people are that's me that's brother Danny del mundo he's been here before now he has one of the churches this is Brother Royal Sano he's Christine's cousin and brother Nestor Espanola and this is Brother dendo this this is the one that I sent back and told him he worked for a mental hospital well he does not work for a mental hospital he works for a medical hospital he's in the security department so I was making a joke and sister Cynthia corrected me on that and said well I don't think he works for mental hospital and I was making a joke that he was there because of our mentality he was there to help us try to keep us out of the mental hospital and then brother Vernon's one that took the picture we start here and we're actually going to end up right here this is where we're going to end up but we all got together and kind of mapped out the plan of of where we were going to go and what we were going to do and it worked out very smooth they gave me a lot of time to uh to recoup and U but toward the end I promise you ain't no place like home I don't care America can be the dump of the of the world but when that security officer when when that uh um passport guy stamped my passport and he said welcome back home I said you ain't kidding he said I see you've been in manella for the Philippines for a few weeks he said what'd you do I said Mission work he said they need Mission work he said but welcome back to the United States and I said you ain't kidding buddy ain't no place like home but here was the arrival and we had a couple of days that kind of you know gold sightseing and first one thing other but the first church service was Sunday morning at brother Vernon's now brother Vernon's Church they call it the mega church because I didn't give the picture but behind that is two huge Towers this is shangala hotel is a five-star hotel and the reason that this came about was they all I think we going to brother nestor's church this this group of people that you'll see some of them they were all security guards in the shangala hotel brother Vernon was the head I believe he was the head of security there at the at the hotel well they got to share somebody shared the message with them then they got to sharing the message with their people then they got to share in the message well all the heads of security of the whole place come in the message at the same time all right so you know brother I think brother Nester was kind of you know he kind of said hey why are you driving hour and a half you know find a place and have church over there so the shangala hotel said well you can have it for x amount of dollars one of our U ballrooms and you can have it every Sunday now they may have to move because of some of the scheduling because they have a lot of weddings and a lot of stuff at this at this hotel but they have church there every Sunday and uh and the price is so cheap till you really can't go and and find another building so it's really nice if you'll go to the next slide this is their U musicians most of their musicians in most churches are young people most I did not see hardly any if you'll see some of these they're probably in their early 20s they do a very wonderful job um these brothers got together one night when we were at a sister's house and they were playing there uh also but uh I tell you something about their music their music is not they don't sing traditional songs they don't have a a song book like we do they sing more they're influenced a lot by and I don't say the people but the LA fontains a lot of their music a lot of the music from Brother bis's Church uh brother Donnie Reagan's Church uh the Y brothers and and lenel and some of those some of their songs they sing them so they sing more bride songs as far as you know updated they don't sing a lot of I let them in a Amazing Grace one night and I think that's the only time they sang A tra what we call a traditional song all the other songs are songs like I said that were written by others and that's okay I mean I'm not saying anything about it I'm just telling you a little bit about their tradition and their influence um they are uh they're good at what they do the the Filipino people are uh very service oriented um a lot of a lot of the people a lot of Filipino people that can't find jobs in the Philippines they go to Hong Kong or they go to different places in the world and they are the service oriented type people and also nurses so they they really um they take care of you make you feel but that's the church that's the mega church brother Vernon's probably got a couple hundred people maybe a little bit more cuz the church goes all the way back over here and you'll see the uh part of it in a minute there's no Pastor study so that's not me sleeping I'm over there praying or doing something I'm not sleeping that's for sure but um and you'll notice you'll notice two boxes in every Church they're not Catholic that's not bones of a priest that's a tithing box and an offering box they don't collect tithing like we do when they when they give the when they give the um uh time for you to give your tith an offering you actually physically go up there and put it in the Box all right so they don't uh they don't go around asking for you know go through the crowd they just start singing a song and people file up and either put it in the tithing tithing box or the offering box so you'll see two boxes at every Church they all do the same thing so this is and he has a lot of young people um a lot of young people in his church and um now let's go to the next slide they all have projectors it doesn't matter if what the churches back up in the mountains they all got a projector they all got a screen and they all sing off of those screens I didn't see a song book I don't think in any church that I went to except maybe maybe one but uh all right go to the next slide this is U this is this Head song leader I think his name is brother Danny he was a professional singer in bars and the Lord got a hold of him and saved his soul and and now he's singing for God not the world so that's that's him there you'll see him in several he he's a good brother real good brother but you see all the people here go ahead next slide this is Sam more saying go ahead I gave this brother I hope he's not watching I gave this brother my camera and I said take a few pictures he took 112 so I had to I had to sh shift through him cuz he's what and I kept seeing him go he you know I'm standing right here he'd go around over here and I'd see him walking he's like and I said what is this guy doing well he's taking 10 pictures at a time every time he goes around so go to the next one this is tell it brother Vernon's that's all that's all of us singing see all these young people there that's uh um that's his wife right there and his daughter Indy somewhere but and his other daughter is over here running the U running the computer most churches um a girl or a sister runs the U runs the computer part like we have the the brothers in the back so go you see that Bron that think that's a nice one there I like that one that one's blue it it's it's nice I like that one I like the material on the it better than I do this one but uh go ahead to the next one this is more of them singing and praying Church goes on back around over here now this is Brother Vernon go ahead this is Brother Vernon now most of you met him he's been here at the church and U he's U very um security minded because he was head of security for a f-star hotel so he couldn't make many mistakes but he would never let me go to the motel unless the door was shutting before he left he wouldn't let me get out of the car and walk to the motel he walked to the door with me made sure the door was closing and then he left so and they all did but he was always either walking beside me or behind me making sure there was nothing going on and he's pretty good siiz guy he's almost my size but um he's um his church is growing um it hasn't been there a long time you know just a few years so he really didn't have an anniversary meeting he has his later on in the year so we didn't do this was just a regular church service on Sunday morning go the next one that's where he introduced me so that and you see I've got a microphone in my hand in a few minutes you'll not see a microphone they said they could hear me loud enough so I put the microphone down Paul said I speak boldly of course you can say loudly if you want to go ahead next slide and this is getting started see there's a two boxes that's his daughter there that's his wife this is everywhere you went everywhere you went there was deacons and preachers somewhere around that Pastor always always in support and this is the Deacon here and this is the Deacon here now I don't know any of their names I can't I wrote a bunch of them down but I can't remember all that all right go to the next one and here we started and we spoke on the uh I I think maybe we spoke here before on the brother Brown said this messenger of Malachi 4 will do two things one turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers and then the second thing literally turned and we spoke on that how that literal means not a type and they really enjoyed it because we're not a type right everything types us everything in this Bible types the Bride of Jesus Christ you said well yeah well we do type Jesus Christ to a degree but still remember he's male right you can only go so far he's the male we're the female so we got our own distinct order and and everything types us so they really enjoyed that so you keep going on through this is still brother Vernon this is getting started very attentive very they listened I mean and then she did a good job cuz she pulled up most of the quotes that I had already go ahead that's his s that's his daughter somebody asked him why are they all smiling well I'm I made some kind of funny I guess I know what it is but it'll take a while for me to tell it cuz I told the people I told the people that um you know that the bride was on display not the groom and I told him I said you know in 1979 when June and I got married I said all this was up here you know I was had all my hair and and I thought I was the one that they was coming to look for you know cuz I was standing up at the altar first I said but when they started playing that Wedding March and them doors open they didn't care where I was they was looking for the bride so that's why they were laughing at me to tell in that story so go ahead keep going see there's the two there's the tithe and offering box I get close to it okay keep going I'm out in the crowd talking to them about something go ahead go back that brone looks good I like that thing that's a nice looking outfit that's I like that all right go ahead and then that's the finish of the service I'm telling them that the Bride of Jesus Christ is on display and that's what God wants he doesn't want to him he knows who he is he knows who he is he wants us to realize who we are amen so that was the uh the theme of the that guy kind of got it started with everybody and obviously they enjoyed it because of the what brother Vernon said um in his um trip overview so let's go now this is all this is this is the one that took the 100 and something pictures I had to hold him closer he'd have took another one but this is the Deacon this is Brother Vernon see he's almost I tell you if if they thought I played basketball I said no I could I've played football and baseball but I ain't big enough you ain't big enough to play basketball now if teren or or somebody them would have been over there they'd have been head taller than anybody cuz most Filipinos are about that size right there so I you know I'm a good four to six inches taller than they are and they thought I was a big guy but these are all deacons that's the song leader but these are all his deacons you saw everywhere he went you had all these people around brother Vernon so he's a good one well they all are good one but brother Vernon's conscious of a lot of things maybe that that other people are not conscious of because of his background and the same way with brother Dale he'll tell you he took care of him also right so let's go to the next one now we traveled then this is Brother nestor's church now brother nestor's Church excuse me Jos see you get me some water if you don't mind um no ice is it filtered and I tell you you really have to be careful cuz brother Joe Green told me he said they gave him a bottle one day of of water and he took it and he turned it and it didn't pop pop somebody had refilled it so if it didn't pop you just handed it back to them cuz they would refill it for them which it doesn't matter to me but it would have been water that wouldn't have been uh very desirable to drink and not to say that their water's dirty but it's just they're used to it where we're not used to it like when we went to TM Island they told me not to eat the fish because the the water is a freshwater lake and it's right in the middle real close to Manila and a lot of things get into that water that don't need to be and they eat it and enjoyed it so they bought me some chicken at McDonald's McDonald's has chicken over there just like Kentucky Fried Chicken but this is Brother nestor's Church it is actually in the old part of Manila kind of like Central Manila brother Dale didn't go to this one uh he was in another building when when Dad was there but this they've been in this building like 3 years now we think we have problems with our post this thing's about 3 foot oh wow and you'll see these people right here if I'm talking over here you'll they'll all be leaning cuz they're trying to look around the pole you know this Pole right here and there several other cuz it's an old theater and the stage is right here and this is an old theater well the the church goes on around and then the church goes on around this way then they have a b and he go to the next one thank you there's the uh sound system and that's part of it then it goes on around but these that they have monitors everywhere too but this Pole right here you see how thick it is that Pole right there it's about 2T by 2T so and there was probably 300 350 people there that night once this was his 27th anniversary meeting go the next one this was his 20 this is the song leader they're all like I said most of them are young people this is the stage of the church all right and then the church goes on around over here so it's in a theater it's in a round setting like this really nice I like this setting of this church all right go ahead that's some of the Believers all dressed nice no one was no one was uh Dressed strong they all had on their long dresses and very conservative very very modest all right go to the next one this is the murderer's row here I told Brother Nester he's going to have to learn how to smile but that's brother Nester brother Danny brother Vernon and myself uh brother Royal was not able to make it to this meeting uh he came to the ministers meeting the next day so this is at brother nestor's church so and he's 27 years he's been having his anniversary meeting so all right let's go to to uh to the next one next wake up uh there's all the young people uh musicians and they would you know they would get there some these these guys were there an hour before the service started and they would be practicing songs and then they stayed 20 or 30 minutes afterwards practicing on new songs so they were really good stayed in key everything was fine so go to the next one but they're all young young Brothers here's a problem brother Nester speaks to Gallo so he's speaking to Gallo he introduces me well I don't know what he's saying I just hear him call my name so he he smiles and says come here well I walk over there I don't have my Bible don't have my notes or nothing I don't know what he's doing so I don't think I put it on the next one see this guy smiling right here cuz I'm I'm walking over I'm like what do you want he said I want you to preach brother so go the next one finally brother Dany brings my Bible brother Dany forgets his glasses so I happened to in my briefcase I've got on my contacts but in my briefcase I've got a pair of reading glasses well he has to put their reading glasses on and he interprets for me and does a really wonderful job so uh go to the next one and there's some of the congregation really pretty place I I like that high ceiling had real good acoustic go ahead and I spoke on a statue of perfect man and I it was less than two hours but they didn't care they really don't once you get in to start preaching you know they really don't care they really enjoyed it uh brother Danny did a real good job interpreting because brother nestor's crowd see it brother Vernon's you didn't see interpreter his people are more young people so they know English brother nestor's congregation since he's uh you may see this but the old man of the island he's the Elder Bishop of the island he's older so his congregation is older so they speak more to gallo and you had to have an interpreter I'll tell you a story about this a little bit later on but go ahead to the next listen very intense you can see now that the people are are over here now they're back up in here all the way around up in the top and back into the uh cuz there's a kitchen area right here that's separated by a wall sisters you think you have a problem feeding 100 people they fed 350 people there that night at brother Danny's they fed 600 people at brother Roy's they fed 400 people in the morning and 700 people in the evening same day and did it just like that just like that that okay so I'm using this little girl for an example and you can't tell her face is red cuz she's brown but um okay go to the next one and then that's finished you see the chart's done so so we're finished there and and praying they really enjoyed it all the ministers these are all Minister Brothers here we're going to see some of these brothers in some of the other slides but we um I love that song um Christine I'd like for you to get that song I fought a good fight Paul I fought a good you know you know what talking about that one is a wonderful song that that they sing I don't know who wrote it you know who wrote is it one of their songs no it is one of their songs but I'd like to get that and let's learn it because Paul was talking about fighting a good fight and kept the faith and all these things so there we are at the end of the anniversary meeting and like I said we preached on the you of a perfect man now at the end of this service I don't see the brother over there but brother Alvin you'll see his church in a minute brother Nester took up money to put a roof on his church we'll see his church in a minute but they not only ra they raised enough money for the roof and I didn't think they'd get it but they got it it was it was up into the thousands of dollars Filipino and uh we as a church gave $200 American dollars to to finish the uh roof on the church and you'll see the church in just the just a little while so this is in central Manila this is now the next day ministers meeting and I told them I got to speak just I just did an introduction on uh on Ephesians 4 and I told him I said you know what I said you as ministers when you look out in your congregation I said all the Sinners sit in the back so they all moved up to the front I don't have a picture of that but they all started migrating to the front brother neer's right here you know and he's like well uh you might have made somebody mad I said really I don't care but I didn't want them back there I wanted them up here so preachers are just the same as lady they like to sit in the back so we brought them all up here so there was 70 ministers some of them drove eight to 9 hours just to get to the meeting and uh it was an all day meeting they fed them too and uh there the couple of topics were how do you witness to Muslims cuz there's a real big Muslim population down in menow and in the lower parts of of the Philippines there's U Muslim communities and they were trying to uh find a way to witness to the Muslims and they brought out some good points but we won't get into that and then there was one um Minister I asked a question about where their dinosaurs on the ark and I leaned over to brother I I was sitting right up here in the on the balcony where we were at the other day when you saw the picture the day before and uh brother uh Vernon or one of them was sitting there you know and I I said really it don't matter but come to find out and I want I'm telling this as a story because they have the same things to deal with that we have to deal with all right this Minister asked that question so he could get up for 30 minutes speak in English which I would thought was weird speaking English and he spends 30 minutes drawing all these charts about different things hardly ever says anything about dinosaurs so come to find out he's kind of like a um a lawyer and he does YouTube videos they were videoing him well he was not doing it for anything in the ministers meeting he was doing it for hisself so he could put it on YouTube and he asked this question kind of like a an attorney asked a leading question he had the answer or he didn't even want the answer he just wanted to be able to get up and talk about it so they have they work you know I told them I said y'all got the same Spirit on preachers that we got on over here they try to forward their own they're not really asking a question because they don't know the answer see when you we ask a question it needs to be a question that you don't know the answer to that's why I question but if you ask a question knowing the answer to it and and then you get up for 30 minutes and put your view into it and you really don't say anything about dinosaurs on the ark you have an agenda that's a little bit different so all the all these ministers knew that and uh and they talked among theel afterwards and we we had a good little good little chuckle about it cuz they ask about how is it in the United States I said well basically it's about the same way I said but the brother that moderates SS brother Tim Calhoun he wouldn't put up with that but one time they said well how do you how do you how do you stop that I said you know what I do if a preacher asks me a question and I'm going to write it down like is the dinosaurs on the ark I'm going to say do you know the answer to that question and if he says yes then I'll say we're going to something else because you already know the answer to it we know what you want to do but if you ask a question not knowing the answer then yes we'll forward that cuz there are answers to questions in these ministers they're all good ministers real good solid ministers they're not uh they're not um they're not babies in the gospel that's for sure not a lot of them are but that was my whole theme over there was trying to trying to help them become a little more mature in the gospel and and and I think maybe we accomplish that to a degree all right let's go to the now this is this is a this is called a jeepy now dad saw a million of these now what happens was in the in the Philippines in the ' 40s you know they were taken over by Japan in the war and then America goes over and liberates helps Liberate the Philippines they had a real big part in it too it wasn't just the United States but there's a big United States influence over there not as much now because we closed a lot of our military bases but we had The Old Willis Jeep Remember The Old Willis Jeep well this is made on basically the same style and they call it a jeepney there's a row of seats right here and the row of seats over here and Robbie there's no seat belts and there's be 10 or 15 sitting on this side 10 or 15 on this side three or four hanging right here two or three sitting up here and about four or five right back here hanging on to the back right and then they stop and pick up more people but these things are built on the style of the the Willis Jeep of the American Soldier or the American Army but they do build these in the Philippines and that is their model it's not a you know it's not a redo they actually make these and that's some of them's made out of stainless steel some of them I didn't show pictures of cuz they didn't have good graphics on the side of them if you understand what I mean and a lot of them was you know had G picture of Jesus and a picture of the Pope and picture of all these things on it so I kind of took one that was a little clean that uh there was no graphics on but that is a big part of their that's their taxi cab and and like I said it's uh it's over full most of the time and they probably 10,000 of them just in Manila cuz that we went he went by a place and cuz they pointed they said your dad saw that place right there and they were just lined just you know several hundred of these things that were either being repaired or bought or wasn't driving that day cuz they rotated them out so it was hundreds of them sitting in a field just hundreds of them just lined up just like you'd see that place down in Toyota place down in Commerce just lined up waiting to be driven but that's a lot of their transportation cuz most of them don't have cars that's a lot of their uh their transportation and it's pretty cheap but they make good money those those jeepy drivers do do pretty well and uh man they're full most of the time go ahead so this is where we were heading to a place called dingalan now dingalan is up north it's a beautiful place this is where brother Dale was at he and brother Ernie and brother Vernon drove up there to see the landslide there was a um a landslide that killed several hundred people destroyed homes um they literally just took bulldozers and pushed the stuff out in the ocean and let it sink bodies and all cuz brother Danny said they were selling fish real cheap after that and I said why are they selling fish cheap he said you'd open them up and they'd have body parts in them so that's what I mean they just pushed everything out in the ocean and let it go because it was so much destruction and brother Dell saw that and you're going to see how that in 10 years that it all grew back up now this is the first brother here here's this is we drove for close to 4 hours actually I'm sorry we got an hour and a half out of the first thing that I want to that I want to tell you that happened I you know I asked the Lord to do something in during this trip that would um that would help me y need help as much as the rest of you do but when we were beginning this trip brother Nester where's he at he may be the one taking the picture but that's brother Jojo that brother is the one that drove daddy around yeah right there and daddy put a roof on his on his house brother Danny there's brother NY right there brother Vernon uh this brother's a brother Danny he was also a nightclub singer very good singer sang country music he knew all of Hank Williams Jr and all little songs you know so he but he's a he's a he's brother Danny's U Deacon and song leader and he does an outstanding job this is John this is my bodyguard I won't show it but his arms is about as big as that spoon right there so it shows him doing this you know I said John if you going to be my bodyguard I said you just stiffen up and I'll use you as a baseball bat cuz he was a little old bitty thing but he drove me around and uh I I gave him a th000 pesos one day and he about cried yeah he was that's only uh how much is that 44 to one that's not much so he he but he drove me around a lot but anyway he was driving brother nestor's van and I didn't get a picture of the van but that van needed some help when we started so we started from Manila we got an hour and a half we got on a toll road and it started running hot that was the hottest day we had it was 98° Fahrenheit and uh 30 something Celsius but um it was 98° that day and the van started overheating started boiling water out of the radiator so we were standing on side of the road before we got to brother Val we were parked on side of the road trying to get the temperature back down and uh and they were all it's like and I'm going to tell this because brother royel told this this is how these people are in the Philippines he said you can wipe out their whole house you can just destroy their business you can take everything they got and he said you'll see them floating down the street in a tub taking a selfie going and they've lost everything they're just that you know they're resilient people and so you know they're they're not worried about this van and I mean we we we're an hour and a half in our journey we've got another two and a half hours to go to get to dingalan so I got concerned cuz I like air conditioning we had two cars brother Danny's got a new car um so I was riding with them but all these other brothers was riding in the van and uh they had to cut the air conditioner off cuz it started overheating well I just leaned up against the van and obviously you know what I was doing I was praying and brother brother Nester said by way do you you sick you know CU I was leaned over the van like he said you sick not feeling good I said no I'm praying leave me alone and uh he said oh okay so I prayed that we'd get back and you know we did we got back that we had to fill it up with water a couple of times but we made the 2 and 1 half hour trip and I mean this guy this brother V is up on a mountain uh in a Military Reservation and uh we made it all the way to dingalan two and a half more hours sure we had to put some water in it but we made her back home so God blessed us with that uh with that opportunity to pray for that because they were they were like well we can't go back home and because we're an hour and a half that way call somebody to come get us or whatever you know I said let's just try to fill it up water and brother Jojo he's a mechanic too so he started filling it up with water and you know we made it all the way up there and back so God blessed us on that that 4H hour trip so uh so the first visit we go to is brother B now this brother here is he is a go-getter he he's a pastor of a church but he also does a lot of work now that's his house go back to the first part that's his kitchen well that's his dining room you got all this this is the road's right here he's right on side of the road but this is his kitchen and everywhere you went you ate so we ate there we stopped at four churches that day and we ate then before I preached at the dingalan church we ate one time before and one time after so we ate six times in one day I had every opportunity in the world to get sick and I didn't so cuz I ate squid and all at this at at the uh at the other place and it was good it wasn't too bad it's kind of like gizzard it tastes like fish but this is his wife and I cannot remember her name but his name is brother Val Diaz he does a lot of work up in the mountains and during the week he goes and takes his backpack we let him out one day right in the middle of nowhere and he heads out and I said what's he going to do he said well brother Nester said oh he's got a preach at a church up on top of this mountain he's walking he's about an hour from his house or further and U I said How's he getting back well come to find out now he come to the ministers meeting this was on Tuesday he come to the ministers meeting on Monday drove back home him and his wife rode 3 hours on a motorcycle to get to The Minister's meeting 3 hours on a little motorcycle you can only have 150 cc motorcycle I told him I had a 1600 CC that one that brother martin gave and they said 1600 CC's I said I know you got cars that ain't even got that much I said I can haul a bunch of people y'all 150 cc is not very fast but he drove all the way down to Manila and all the way back and he couldn't drive on the interstate because it's too low of CCS he had to drive on the off-roads so 3 hours there and back and he was there the next day that's him at his house with his wife she went with him so it doesn't hurt them look they look happy they don't they don't have any you know bug marks on them so that's brother Val I I really like this brother I I really like him a lot so let's go to the next one this is his church this is me and brother Vernon heading down church is down in the bottom all right keep going that's us it they always want to have a picture taken at the pull pit with the you know with the pastor okay so go ahead that he's building his house a little at a time so he's his other home is over here and it's just nothing but that it's just tarps and and um basket weave uh bamboo and all that the roof is thatch that you have to replace every 2 or 3 years so he's building along a little at a time um his that's home now go to the next one brother Nester told me he said brother the way you should have never had your picture took of that nice Motel he said you should have your picture took of this cuz brother Nester told me he said brother the way don't you know there's a blue book and a red book The Blue Book you don't ever show anybody the red book is what you show everybody you show you show everybody this and and I have one picture of me standing there and this thing is wire and my head's up about here That's how little that thing is my head's right at the wire so this is his deacon's house house that's a home that's where somebody lives all right next I showed you these for a reason cuz two of them are not with us anymore I brought them back with me they were good but I told Brother Val he he raises them see all the different age groups and I told him I said I like Duck cuz I'd eat duck over here before I said I like Duck he said okay he said I'll bring you some next brother Danny's meeting so two of them are not with that picture anymore I don't know which two so I'm not going to I'm not going to judge but they were good so they were sacrificed but uh he raises these ducks as a side business also and sells them so go ahead that's the back of his house now right here go to the next one that's their men and women's bathroom wow men and women yeah there's no petition there I'm not holding anything up that's the bathroom and they're just as happy as a lark to have that and actually I told them I said there's only one place I Saw toilet seats and that was in the motel nowhere somebody bought them one one time like brother Jackie Benton or somebody I think bought him one and they got insulted that they bought them a toilet seat so or they felt you know they felt you know that we didn't think it was good enough for us to use that but that's their bathroom I think they are going to make a petition eventually but this is all kind of new but this is the back of his church and that's mainly all of uh churches have this facility for their for their for their bathrooms so all right go ahead now we're at the church now the reason I didn't take any pictures outside is because when we left brother BS we went to a Brother Ray quare and I didn't put a I I don't know if I lost the pictures or not and then a Brother Don Don so we stopped at four churches before we got there to the dingalan church when we did it was dark so we were going to stay there overnight and then I was going to take pictures later so this is the church that brother Dale 10 years ago gave money to to build and I'll give you the story behind that when we see the outside of it so go ahead that's some of their kids always singing always and that's me and brother Danny go ahead see that's another Baron that's my green one rich Marlo you like that right there now buddy that's sharp my blue one's the sharpest one everybody liked the blue one now at the next morning we're up here staying in a in a little cubicle like thing and um with a bed and and and but there most of their I'll show you in a minute most of their showers and toilets are the same in the same room okay so that what was there and I didn't take a picture of that but this is the Pacific Ocean this is dingalan right here and the church is right over in here and um we went down into the town got to meet the mayor she was a nice lady go ahead but right over here somewhere in this area not exactly but don't don't don't quote me but right here is where daddy saw this was all red cuz it had slid down and pushed every bit of this out into the ocean all right uh that's 10 years ago so you can see it's all grown back uh very well palm trees are over here uh it's a real nice fishing Village um they built a big Pier we're standing on a big concrete pier that you could put a cruise ship on and uh so you know the Lord's blessed them in some way to to come back up in 10 years but all this was destroyed everything was pushed down into the ocean all right all right go ahead this is the pier we're standing on here this is where they're and this is the other side uh the military is getting ready to build a airport right here and but this is brother Danny uh this is brother Chris I preached for him that's brother vile again I don't know who that brother is and then that's brother Danny we're standing on the pier all right go ahead this boy right here his job you see this right here he's pull this down it was up here like this he sits there every day and the tourists and all the people of the Town Throw coins into the ocean now this is deep enough for a cruise ship to come into so it's probably 50 ft that they've dredged it out he sits there people throw coins and he dies down and gets the coins and he brings it back up in his mouth and that's how he makes a living wow if you old somewhere right here there's a little pile of coins cuz we we're chunking coins out there you know and he's diving down and I mean that that kid's gone for 30 seconds most of the time and he'll come up with the coins and that's what he does every day for a living all right now it's daylight we're back up at the uh church the church is sitting here we're still in dingalan this is the house of the Widow which we'll talk about in a minute and this is her little store now what happened was go to the next one her husband was the pastor of that church of the of the church when Daddy was there or he had become the pastor they built the church and brother I got to get his his name right his name well the pastor now is brother ernan Lozano all right um now right here this is him but now this is the wife of the former Pastor her name is Sister prey antones now brother antones was the pastor and he died in 2009 all right this baby was two weeks old when he died this child she had several other children and whether you know it or not we give her $100 a month to survive she lives off that $100 a month that we send her this church brother Dale decided and she cried the whole time we were there she said I'm not mad she said oh she can say in English she said tears of joy tears of joy tears of joy but she lives off of that plus her little store she's got a little store but she lives right there goes to church cuz you know what people they don't have a a social program like we do in the United States they don't get on welfare or Medicare I'm talking or Medicaid whatever you know and I don't I'm not belittling anybody here I'm just saying they don't have it so either you survive or you don't well she's surviving off of that little store selling little candies and stuff and the $100 a month that we send her and she thought that brother Dale was just going to send it right after he died and then quit well that's been 09 2015 we're still sending it so and we send it through brother buron so God bless you for doing that so this is the church this is the one that was built now when I was preaching I didn't have a um this was the first part of the of the U Journey so I didn't have anybody taking pictures of the congregation but they were sitting out here I'll show you in a minute they were already overflowing out of the building and sitting over here well now sister prey's house is right here so the the the Widow's house is right here the pastor's house now is over on this side and then they built houses around that and brother Dale and another brother from Germany are the ones that built this brother um gird you remember brother remember the German brother that preached for us Becker Marcus Becker his pastor and Dad help build this church all right so go to the next one this is the inside they were all there were more seats out that night that we were there and this is the next day afterward there was a big old green lizard run right across through there I'm talking about a big old not an iguana but it was a big one cuz I told Brother Vernon he said I saw it I said I was I was hoping that maybe it would fall down and it' have a Revival up there in the front but they didn't but that thing stayed right up here and run around through there and he said yeah I saw it so anyway this is the inside of the church now this is the pastor of course brother Nester brother Vernon brother Danny and myself at the pull pit there the next day so now next that's the pastor's study that's the pastor's office kind of crude huh and right behind it right over there past that petition is another one of them one hole bathrooms all right so this is the pastor's study go to the next one they about outgrown their building so what they're wanting to do is now this is sister prey's house this is her that's her little U thing the road's right there so they're not far off the highway but the people were sitting all out in here that night they've grown to something people in that little building so what they want to do is is enclose to here enclose that take this wall out put a door right here and uh it's going to cost about I think brother Vernon said about $3,000 to finish all that plus make him a study back here in the back that we just saw and put another bathroom facility cuz there's only one bathroom there so that's that was a need that was presented not to me but I asked them how much it would be cuz they were talking about you know expanding they do all the work their yourself any material cost that would be all material cost they have no labor everybody in that church does the work so there's no contractor fees or or anything labor wise that's all materials all right so this is that's the church in dingon that they want to try to expand this is the side of it this is sister prey's house here but this is the side I just want to show you the depth of it they want to come on out about another 15 or so feet this way and uh take out this wall and have more space to uh to worship but as far as the church structure go far as the structure it's really good I mean it's built well uh the sides are built strong it's a really nice building if it was painted it look it look beautiful but all they need is just lver it on the Windows they don't need any no air conditioning all right go to the next one that's the uh this is the shower and that's the toilet shower in the toilet that's it right there you just run you some water in there you take that thing right there and and then you either if you do it real slow if you just like to trickle or you can do it real fast you can do this but that's the shower that's the shower stall and that's the toilet all in the same room so and they're just as happy to have that running water as as anybody so if your uh if your uh nice little shower ever goes out just remember we can go back to the bucket and I'm sure some of y'all some of you old daddy I'm sure remembers that old bucket with the standing in that bucket and first time I went to Jamaica that's how I took a shower took it in a tub like that with cyan water which was a little brown so anyway so we come from there um we come back to another brother's church and we ate again let's go to the next slide this is Brother Alvin's church now this is where they're meeting now there's a hundred people sit in that little bitty room and have church they have to take the chairs down and put them over here then they put them out well now he's building go ahead to the next one he got funds somewhere to build this part I I don't know I I really don't care I didn't ask but that's brother Alvin he's a young brother he drives a um a taxi not one like not a jeepney but a one of those three-wheel tricycles for a job that's his wife that's one of his deacons of course that's all my Entourage there but brother Alvin we were able to that's the church that we were able to bring get enough money which I we gave $200 from the church to finish the roof on that church but there's no windows doors or floor you can see it's the floor right there it's just it's humped up and all got grass and everything in it but they're working on a little at of time and uh trying their best to get it done so they can worship in it all right go ahead now this was from dingalan we went back got home safe in that same van that we prayed for the day before we got home safe and then we went to brother Dennis credito this is his song leader went to his church on uh Thursday we had Thursday night service there and he's building a new church that brother Joe Green and some of the others have helped purchase the land and it was so dark I could not take pictures I couldn't get my iPhone to to flash but he has Church down a back street that's just wide enough for a motorcycle to get down and uh but they're just as happy as they can be so go to the next one and that's us getting ready we're getting ready to go there and then now again that's brother Dennis he's the pastor of the church uh we preached on um the book of books how that we were the book The open book and really enjoyed it didn't get a picture of the congregation there was probably 40 or 45 people there and um I I got the one God thing down you see many of the pictures I got one finger up the only one all right go ahead and that's where we're preaching on the book and then this is his house this is the wall of the church the church is here and you just go right around and you go into his house and it's just a probably from here to there long and he had this is his two children really sweet wife and uh and brother Dennis their church is up on a hill about maybe not a quarter of a mile from where they're at brother Joe Green helped them by the building and let tell you something about that the owner this the owner of the property there's an existing building in it burn well for about a year they were wanting to brother Dennis and them were wanting to purchase it the owner wouldn't let them purchase it didn't even want to sell it well supposedly people started going by because the street goes down like this and the the the house is right here and it's pretty good size bank but the house is right here people started seeing ghost in the house the guy sold it to him for [Applause] nothing I told him I said it was a ghost all right it was a holy ghost but people kept and it's right it an intersection and you look up and they said they started they'd see lights and people you know somebody moving through the house and cuz it was burned down it was just nothing but a shell and um we went up there and look they've dug out for the basement already got the basement dug out but they don't have enough funds to finish the building yet but I think brother Joe Green's working on that and I'm going to talk to him about it a little bit later and see what U see how much they got on it but he's a real good brother um I think he's a part of the one of the mystery Expos I think I think he is they can correct me on the internet if they're watching in but I think he's a product probably 50% of the people I met were products of the mix mystery Expos that they started back in 2004 with brother Ernie and brother roel and all those that that uh did a lot of work back then but that mystery Expo you're going to see um tonight cuz you're not going to see it today I'm going to finish it's 10 minutes till 12 this is about half way through so but this was a rest day this was Fort Santiago brother Nestor took me there and it was built in the 1500s so it's a lot older than brother dick found something older this fort was built by the Spaniards in 1500s it's been occupied by everybody even Japan occupied it in World War II America came in and and helped the Philippines liberate but one before they liberated them there was 10 and something people back over in here that were prisoners of the Japanese and the Japanese killed them and buried them in a hole before the Americans and philipinos could find them so a lot of sad history with that but also that was a fort that that's kind of in central part of Manila and it's a historic site there was a uh brother and I like brother Nester because I told him I said you're you're old enough to know some of this history so he was a good tour guide we went to the National Museum before we went to here so we got to know a lot of history of the Philippines and um a wonderful history uh back from the Spaniards for 3 or 400 years and then others came in mellin if those of you that know anything about history mellin I think he was killed over there and but he was one of the ones that that come to the island and it had a real big Spanish influence for a long time so that's Fort Santiago and there was a man named Jose Ral and uh he was a he's their national hero just for a second I'll tell you about him but they they kind of type him with Jesus Christ not that he was a very religious man but he went against the Catholic Church church he wrote two books and I got him at home they they they found them for me in English and um he wrote two books and they more of a it's more of a parable of what the Catholic church was doing to the people on the island he was writing uh an under a parable an underlying meaning he was telling what they were doing and there was a big Revolt came up uh he didn't uh he did not incite any riots or any revolts but the people caught what he was saying that the Catholic church had suppressed him and done all these things to him and um um they had a Revolt well when they brought when rile came back to the to the Philippines they tried him and convicted him of treason and shot him executed him not too far from here they kept him in here in this prison then they walked him out and uh shot him in a firing squad um the Catholic Church says he handed before he died but he didn't but they've got a monument for him over here and he he was he was he's a national hero now so I got to learn a little bit about him he I'm I'm getting started on the book that he wrote but he was very smart man he was an optometrist he an eye doctor and he traveled around the country and uh then now here we are at the same rest day we go over to brother uh Vernon's family this is you see all this right behind it here and behind it over here are big tall buildings but what happens is they have a lot of their uh a lot of our call centers are over there because when it's midnight over here it's daylight over there and vice versa so there's a lot of people go to work at midnight because it's 12:00 during the day here they go to work and have all the call centers well what happened was there's no place for them to eat all the restaurants were closed so they started a what do you call call it a plaza this is a plaza this is a bunch of restaurants and what they do is at 10:00 at night they bring all their street food from the different local restaurants and they put them and they have like this this right here is one section and that's where I saw the the the meat that was cooked in blood it's back over here but there's probably 30 restaurants we see they they service those two buildings till 4:00 in the morning then they take every bit of this up and it's a parking lot for the daytime people but man I'm going to tell you something I wanted some street food this is street food this is chicken on a stick and something else on a stick and something else in that pot right there but you could get whatever you wanted but these right here are mango shakes and if you'll look see them straws they're huge there's Bigg around bigger round of my thumb because it's got chunks of mango that you couldn't get up through the straw if you had a normal straw so this is full of mango and it's only like a dollar American it'd be about $10 over here for that much mango juice but um this is Brother Vernon this is his daughter this is his daughter Andy this is his wife uh Irene all right go ahead I cannot remember his oldest daughter this is his oldest daughter his oldest his oldest son is in the Army I met him for just a few minutes and then they shipped
