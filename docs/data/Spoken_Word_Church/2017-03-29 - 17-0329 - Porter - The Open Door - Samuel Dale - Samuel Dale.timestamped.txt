[3:00] Sister Christine they said was downstair
[3:02] so she's doing better we're glad for for
[3:05] that all right John 10 okay and Wade
[3:10] bringing there this past Sunday
[3:13] afternoon and bringing his message and I
[3:16] I always told them to go ahead when
[3:18] they're bringing their message go ahead
[3:20] and Minister it doesn't bother me I I'll
[3:22] fit in somewhere but it doesn't make any
[3:26] difference he was speaking about the end
[3:28] you know and how it was so we you'll see
[3:31] this will tie right into it I hope to
[3:33] where that will help each one of us okay
[3:36] John 10 verily verily I say unto
[3:40] you he that entereth not by the door
[3:44] into the Sheepfold but climbeth up some
[3:47] other way the same is a
[3:49] thief and a robber but he that enter
[3:53] entereth in by the
[3:56] door is The Shepherd of the sheep now
[3:59] watch it but he that entereth in by the
[4:01] door is The Shepherd of the sheep now
[4:04] it's explaining who this is and what's
[4:06] taking place
[4:08] right see if we don't come by him we're
[4:11] going to come some other way and be a
[4:13] thief and a robber and it won't work but
[4:15] if we come by him through the door now
[4:17] watch that as we go along into the
[4:20] message it says to him the Porter
[4:24] openeth and the sheep hear his voice and
[4:27] he calleth his own Sheep by name and
[4:30] leadth them out and when he putteth
[4:32] forth his own sheep he goeth before them
[4:35] and the Sheep follow him for they know
[4:37] his voice and a stranger they will not
[4:40] follow but will flee from him for they
[4:43] know not the voice am of strangers you
[4:47] may be seated the Lord add his Blessing
[4:49] to the reading of the word now what I
[4:51] want you to think about we won't spend
[4:54] that much time on this but I want you to
[4:57] think about
[5:00] the situation is laying out here that
[5:04] it's laying out who it is we know who
[5:06] the door is we know all of the things we
[5:09] know who the Shepherd of the sheep is
[5:11] and that and it's showing the importance
[5:13] of that and it only mentions the porter
[5:16] right in his
[5:18] job it doesn't mention him in any lineup
[5:23] or any thoughts he's got a job all right
[5:27] now that's what we'll be getting into
[5:29] the Lord willing to go on in through the
[5:31] message now sometime when you get a
[5:33] chance take and just run through the
[5:35] Bible on the little word Porter or
[5:39] especially the word Porters you know
[5:41] plural because there were special people
[5:45] set aside for special
[5:48] events all right you know the porter was
[5:50] and it we read here
[5:52] see and to him the porter openeth the
[5:56] door okay now we know the door we know
[5:59] who Christ is and thing but we'll get to
[6:02] that later if we can but now to just
[6:05] give you a little run through 1
[6:07] chonicles run it run it through there
[6:09] about ver you know 1 chonicles 9 and
[6:12] read about these things and and there's
[6:15] plenty more but I mean this is just
[6:16] giving you a
[6:18] thought there are the the keepers of the
[6:25] Tabernacle now the porters were the
[6:27] keepers of the Tabernacle they had
[6:29] certain things to take place am mainly
[6:32] you know one point to really to emphasis
[6:35] where they were the keepers of the entry
[6:38] it says in chonicles 1 chonicles 9 and
[6:42] verse 19 they were keepers of the entry
[6:46] in other words the entry they in you
[6:48] couldn't come in if you'll read the
[6:49] whole background and do they'll be
[6:51] setting and they're setting going north
[6:54] east south west see we can go into the
[6:58] combat Beast and the the things like
[7:00] that but not preferring to lead that
[7:02] away but to just give you an example and
[7:06] really they had to do with the door of
[7:08] the Tabernacle of the
[7:11] congregation all right now they were
[7:14] special chosen to be Porters in the
[7:19] gates and one listing of them were that
[7:21] there was 20 and 12 of them and they
[7:26] were to keep up with certain things uh
[7:29] you
[7:30] know and certain offices and certain
[7:33] doings I'm just coming down in
[7:36] Chronicles and their their children had
[7:38] the oversight of the gates in other
[7:41] words it come even down from the porter
[7:43] coming on in to the oversight of the
[7:46] gates of the Lord namely The House of
[7:49] the Tabernacle by Wards they were in uh
[7:53] you know they they had a lot of things
[7:56] to do all right now watch what it says
[8:00] about them then and these Porters
[8:03] now so they and their children see come
[8:06] on down into the family in four quarters
[8:08] were the
[8:09] porters toward the east west north and
[8:13] south so anywhere they would be a door
[8:17] there would be a porter all right and to
[8:20] their Brethren they were in the that
[8:22] were in The Villages they come in after
[8:23] a certain amount of days and things and
[8:26] they even were connected and brought in
[8:28] through the Levites
[8:30] because it would come through into the
[8:33] porters of connecting with the Levites
[8:35] look for these Levites the four Chief
[8:39] Porters so they would name the the
[8:41] special Levites and name them as Porters
[8:45] all right now listen what I'm getting at
[8:47] and they were setting their offices and
[8:49] there were certain things they were over
[8:51] the chambers and treasuries of the horse
[8:54] House of God they had special things a
[8:57] lot of different things if you read it
[8:59] you get a lot of things and they lodged
[9:01] round about the
[9:03] house of God because the charge was upon
[9:07] them and the opening thereof every
[9:08] morning pertained to them in other words
[9:11] they would open up they get a thing to
[9:13] go but if you back up in it and study a
[9:15] little bit you'll find that if somebody
[9:17] was even
[9:18] coming and you see them coming forth way
[9:22] off or something that Porter was
[9:24] responsible to keep up with all of that
[9:27] and he would recognize that and and see
[9:30] who's coming and and declare who's
[9:32] coming and what's taking place all right
[9:35] now watch to it and certain of them had
[9:38] their charge of the ministering
[9:41] vessels all right that they should bring
[9:44] them in and out by tail in other words
[9:47] at the Times some of them also were
[9:50] appointed to oversee the
[9:52] vessels and all the instruments of the
[9:55] sanctuary and the fine floor and the
[9:57] wine the oil and the amen frankincense
[10:00] and and the spices and
[10:02] things and one of the Levites un it was
[10:05] the first born excuse me we don't need
[10:07] to go that yeah let's stop there I just
[10:11] wanted you to look at something you know
[10:14] about this
[10:16] Porters in other words what a porter
[10:18] would
[10:19] do the porter opens the
[10:23] door all right now to him it's assigned
[10:28] a special job he's not only insign
[10:32] assigned just to take care of the the
[10:34] door opening he's assigned to the
[10:36] vessels he's assigned to the Tabernacle
[10:39] everything in it there were
[10:41] Porters assigned to that job they had a
[10:44] job to do and everything was taken care
[10:47] of but notice what they said he said
[10:49] they were watching in other words they
[10:51] look Northeast South and West it's like
[10:53] you combat beast and things you can go
[10:55] through and bring that in you know of
[10:58] the things that happening but the main
[11:00] thing I wanted you to think about and
[11:01] get it into your
[11:03] mind how
[11:05] important it is to be a
[11:10] porter and how important his job is now
[11:14] brother randam will emphasize a lot and
[11:17] you'll connect right back in with the
[11:19] scriptures that like you're coming to a
[11:21] man's
[11:23] house and the porter meets you at the
[11:26] door he gives you the Garment to put
[11:29] wrong right you understand what I'm
[11:32] saying you know you come to a man's
[11:34] house everybody in the house it don't
[11:36] matter rich or poor when they come to
[11:38] that house they're washed they're run
[11:40] and there everybody is
[11:43] given one certain kind of Rob one color
[11:46] we call it one
[11:48] material you know and everybody was
[11:50] sitting there looked alike it didn't
[11:52] matter where you rich or poor or what it
[11:54] was it was at Porter's job to make sure
[11:57] all of that was in place
[11:59] all right to him it was given to guard
[12:02] those
[12:04] things you know but it was given to him
[12:09] to open that
[12:11] door amen right see he he had he was in
[12:15] charge of that to make sure that door
[12:17] and we read there in the scripture where
[12:19] it says to him the porter
[12:22] openeth even though he's the The
[12:25] Shepherd of the
[12:26] sheep even though he's the the Great one
[12:29] in
[12:31] charge it's the porter amen that opens
[12:35] the door amen now we know for certainly
[12:38] what we're talking about in that don't
[12:39] we that Jesus said I'm the
[12:42] door and the door is a revelation of
[12:45] Jesus Christ given to whatever age or
[12:47] time or whatever but it's delivered by a
[12:50] porter
[12:54] amen if he don't open the door
[12:59] is not
[13:02] opened but as I said then after he even
[13:05] opens the door and allows you to come in
[13:07] he still has to do with your garment you
[13:10] wire he takes off your garments no
[13:12] matter how rich or whatever you are or
[13:14] how poor everybody's got the same
[13:16] garment cuz everybody get the same
[13:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[13:21] right no matter where you're rich or
[13:23] poor when God gives you the new birth he
[13:26] gives it to you he don't give it to the
[13:27] person next to you and it don't matter
[13:29] where they're rich or poor or whatever
[13:31] they are it has nothing to do with it
[13:33] but see it's always a porter involved in
[13:36] it now remember that for later if we get
[13:39] to that part trying to to bring the
[13:41] message all right
[13:44] now what have we been talking
[13:46] about now watch your Porter because your
[13:50] porter porter or how you pronounce it
[13:53] he's going to have to do with that door
[13:57] opening all right and what he's going to
[13:59] have to do in a minute you're going to
[14:01] see him I hope you'll follow me you'll
[14:04] see the Porter's job will be the Jubilee
[14:08] priest
[14:11] amen because he's the one to declare
[14:13] amen right all right now want you that
[14:17] tied together in your thoughts you
[14:19] remember how we brought out to the other
[14:20] night or there the other day the Jubilee
[14:23] priest the prophet gave it
[14:25] twice all right a special job
[14:29] when it come around to a time of Jubilee
[14:32] He was to ride through the land and
[14:35] proclaim a jubilee is coming but now
[14:39] remember what I've tried to emphasize
[14:41] over and
[14:44] over is that
[14:47] priest did not wait until that actual
[14:53] date in other words if it was released
[14:56] we found it it's released every seven
[14:57] years right all right then we went
[15:00] through the Bible and and there's a
[15:02] release then coming to the 50th all
[15:06] right but see he doesn't wait till the
[15:08] 50th comes to Proclaim it
[15:13] right he has to Proclaim it before
[15:16] then see we look at it like well he just
[15:19] comes forward he says y'all free to go
[15:21] now that didn't
[15:24] work in other words if you were dealing
[15:26] with your sevens
[15:29] okay in the sixth year the priest would
[15:34] declare next year is the year of
[15:38] Freedom he would hand that message down
[15:41] to all the others that's why I emphasize
[15:44] if you'll notice it emphasized in the
[15:46] scripture gave but the Levites were
[15:50] connected who's the
[15:52] Levites the priest the
[15:55] preachers so the the high priest didn't
[15:58] write to the land he only proclaimed at
[16:02] Jerusalem you
[16:04] know then others took that message that
[16:07] he had declared and they went forth and
[16:09] told him there's going to be a
[16:13] jubilee you got a
[16:15] year now we can go all the way through
[16:17] and tie back into where even people hung
[16:19] in a city people out out in the fields
[16:23] is different thing but somebody hung in
[16:25] a city you got one year
[16:29] you got one
[16:31] year don't be caught in the city we'll
[16:34] see that later as it comes forth you got
[16:36] one year if you're in a
[16:39] city to get out of there and that's
[16:42] amazing what I'm trying to get you to
[16:43] see is that in that sixth year that high
[16:47] priest would declare there's going to be
[16:50] a
[16:51] jubilee all right that would
[16:54] go through seven sevens to be 49
[16:59] all right and when it falls at the end
[17:02] of that period or that thought it really
[17:05] builds up in a great thing that I wish
[17:08] you would listen to what I'm trying to
[17:09] say and not argue the point with
[17:13] me you said what do you mean argue well
[17:15] I mean try to get your own idea just
[17:17] listen and then come tell me later
[17:19] whether you agree with it or not just
[17:21] listen to what I'm trying to express
[17:23] it'll bring out a beautiful point
[17:26] because see when you were coming down to
[17:27] that 50th you didn't wait until that 50
[17:30] come and went out and told everybody you
[17:32] had to prepare it we went through a
[17:34] service or two on it to prepare the
[17:37] people for the coming
[17:39] Jubilee all right so then that high
[17:43] priest would
[17:44] declare on the 48th
[17:47] year he would declare that there's
[17:51] coming a
[17:52] jubilee 49 next year
[17:59] you you following me but then at the
[18:02] same time he's declaring it he's
[18:05] speaking of the 50th because he's
[18:08] telling you hey the 49th is a great
[18:12] thing am but this is a special time this
[18:16] is coming to the Jubilee of the golden
[18:19] jubilee for a
[18:24] 50 and see if you can't see what I'm
[18:26] talking about
[18:29] when brother brandom started in his
[18:34] ministry he was trying to get the word
[18:37] to the people
[18:40] right but yet he was learning himself or
[18:45] increasing
[18:47] right and see then he was growing in
[18:50] Grace and
[18:52] knowledge and the freedom he was
[18:54] declaring in the
[18:57] 50s was only speaking of a time to
[19:01] come it was declaring a freedom of
[19:03] eternal life in the soul of the
[19:07] individual but then when he moves on up
[19:09] into the
[19:10] 60s his message becomes stronger and
[19:14] stronger stature of a perfect man 62
[19:18] coming in from 62 striking the seal
[19:25] 63 then he said I'm not the messenger he
[19:29] wasn't brother Randon was not the
[19:30] messenger to
[19:31] Pentecost he was not the lady oan
[19:34] messenger he was in that age bringing
[19:37] his
[19:39] message but it's got to fit into a
[19:41] certain spot and I'm just trying to get
[19:42] you to look at it like that see to show
[19:45] how that they would be so perfect to
[19:47] line up with the
[19:48] word do you get tied up in the numbers
[19:51] just forget the numbers get the
[19:54] story
[19:55] right brother R started out trying to de
[19:58] Liberty but what could he
[20:01] declare I'm not against it now you no
[20:03] better even think of some thoughts would
[20:06] be running through your mind that
[20:07] brother Dale's against brother brownon
[20:09] we trying to straighten you know better
[20:10] than now you know what I'm talking about
[20:12] is true you know in brother Brown's
[20:14] early Ministry he had
[20:18] things that were not exactly right in
[20:21] his
[20:23] doctrin because the word had not open
[20:29] right but as it went along the word
[20:31] began to
[20:32] open and as it began to open it began to
[20:35] correct him right in what things he was
[20:39] bringing you said well no no he was
[20:41] right all the time well you you're going
[20:44] to have to argue him about it because he
[20:46] had a lot of things he said about that
[20:48] if you you said well it's just
[20:51] statements like I said the other day
[20:52] where he said you know talking
[20:56] about being to a place
[21:00] to where God could be there and he said
[21:03] I used to think that God hated me and
[21:06] Jesus loved
[21:09] me he said till I found out they were a
[21:11] selfs sameed person well you know what
[21:14] it might have been two years old when he
[21:15] found that out I don't care I'm just
[21:19] making the statement somewhere he found
[21:21] out Jesus and God was a selfs sameed
[21:23] person oh he was a prophet all the time
[21:26] Heen
[21:31] but you better be careful how you're
[21:33] bringing that because we can go down
[21:35] through the message and pick up some
[21:37] things
[21:38] that like him teaching the white horse
[21:40] rider with the
[21:43] Antichrist I mean Jesus Christ until
[21:46] later when the seals
[21:48] broke
[21:50] right like him teaching the
[21:53] the evidence of the Holy
[21:57] Ghost was
[22:00] love now he's the one that said these
[22:02] things so you going to argue with him
[22:04] now that's right we've give them to you
[22:06] so you you can't argue with me about
[22:09] it he's the one that said
[22:11] it he said the Lord come and
[22:13] straightened him out in a
[22:15] vision about his teaching of the
[22:19] evidence of the Holy
[22:21] Ghost I'm trying to illustrate how that
[22:24] he was climbing climbing climbing
[22:28] by illustrating it like the numbers that
[22:31] we were giving under your
[22:33] sevens we proved it by the scripture the
[22:36] prophet that under those sevens as long
[22:39] as you're dealing in a time of seven
[22:42] you're in trouble that's
[22:44] right I like Wade's trying to bring out
[22:48] and I hope he continues more and I'll
[22:49] just say this part the Seven Seals the
[22:52] end of all
[22:54] things well you know what's the end of
[22:56] anything
[23:02] what's the end of
[23:04] anything the beginning of something else
[23:06] are further advancement in what you're
[23:09] doing right so the Seven Seals the end
[23:12] of all things what does it mean it just
[23:14] means that's come to an end it means
[23:16] it's opened into something else it's
[23:18] brought the person of Jesus Christ amen
[23:21] that's why I've always said it like
[23:23] this Jesus only put six seals in Matthew
[23:26] 24 right right
[23:29] but come on folks he was the sevenant
[23:32] you agree with that he was the sevenant
[23:34] seal himself well that what about when
[23:36] he unfolded that and revealed
[23:38] it I'm trying to get you to just simple
[23:41] follow something to where the Bible
[23:44] shows you right where we're
[23:47] at see then brother Brandon was
[23:49] declaring a liberty to still be under a
[23:52] seven that would have
[23:54] limitations because remember how we
[23:56] brought it out in Exodus if a man went
[23:58] into bondage with his wife she come out
[24:01] but if he went into bondage and his
[24:02] master gave him a wife and she had
[24:04] children then they stayed in bondage and
[24:07] he went
[24:08] free right limitations showing things
[24:12] are not exactly right showing that
[24:15] there's a problem there somewhere all
[24:18] right let's see if I can find that one I
[24:20] quote a lot of things and sometimes
[24:22] people say well you need to read now I
[24:25] didn't give them this
[24:26] one excuse me
[24:29] we got crossed up on some of our notes a
[24:32] while ago and had to do some correcting
[24:35] out you remember the statement I've made
[24:38] to you that brother R said the Holy
[24:40] Ghost is still
[24:44] bound off the message the Feast of the
[24:47] trumpets paragraph 206 207 they don't
[24:51] have this so don't ask them if they get
[24:52] it up
[24:54] fine says while this group down here has
[24:57] got 2,000 years bound at the ri 2,000
[25:00] bound at the river Euphrates and has
[25:03] been bound for 2,000 years now listen we
[25:07] know that's what's bound there listen
[25:09] also that church has bound the Holy
[25:14] Ghost Now read it that church has bound
[25:18] the Holy
[25:20] Ghost for nearly 2,000
[25:23] years I know that's false fine come on
[25:26] just hold on under Maran back Di
[25:28] martyrdom and there and under the church
[25:31] AG it's been bound not at e euphra river
[25:35] Euphrates but theor of Creeds and dogmas
[25:38] that the Holy Ghost can't work in the
[25:41] church because of man-made systems
[25:44] that's right so the Holy Ghost never
[25:46] been free in the church the way God
[25:47] wanted it to be right
[25:51] amen is that what he's
[25:54] saying but it's to Door Creeds and
[25:56] dogmas that the Holy Spirit came can't
[25:58] work in the church because of man-made
[26:00] system but she's going to be
[26:03] liberated now if you say well she wasn't
[26:05] bound down to there well then he sure is
[26:07] talking about going something going to
[26:09] be liberated he said she's coming back
[26:11] that's what the Bible
[26:15] says
[26:17] right you say yeah but the Holy Ghost
[26:20] was free on the day of Pentecost
[26:22] amen it was free but before it ever done
[26:25] very much
[26:26] Freedom they started putting limitations
[26:29] on
[26:31] it and bound it amen God can't work
[26:34] where denominationalism is at no and you
[26:36] know
[26:39] that are you following what I'm
[26:43] saying that under those sevens you could
[26:46] never get totally free that's that's all
[26:49] I've tried to emphasize and seven is the
[26:51] last number there's not an eight there's
[26:54] only seven days of the week eight is
[26:57] eternity amen right so what is the
[27:00] Eighth
[27:01] Day when the seventh day is finished you
[27:04] got the eighth day if you want to call
[27:06] it to one back on the next 50 I ain't
[27:08] going to argue no points with you I'm
[27:10] just going to make the statement it's
[27:11] just it's the point of what I'm talking
[27:15] about the ending of the seventh seal is
[27:18] eternal life if you don't believe that
[27:21] read the quote way gave our Wednesday
[27:23] where brother Brown said it's the end of
[27:24] the Millennium it's the end of this it's
[27:26] the end of that it's he said it's even
[27:28] end of the seventh
[27:31] seal well you know why it's the end of
[27:33] the seventh seal because when it's
[27:36] revealed you have the very product of
[27:40] what you've been looking at that's all
[27:42] I'm talking
[27:43] about under those jubilees back there
[27:47] they would have a
[27:49] release what did the prophet call the 77
[27:51] 49 he said the Tope of the seven Church
[27:55] ages so down to the seven Church ages
[27:58] there's never been a holy ghost Freedom
[28:00] yet like you're going to see
[28:03] amen well you looking for a free yes
[28:06] exactly I'm looking for God to move
[28:09] among the church until she'll be a
[28:12] living moving Idol of God well we don't
[28:15] sure don't look like it I ain't got
[28:16] nothing to do with that and you ain't
[28:18] either what you look at and what I look
[28:20] at don't have nothing to do with it it's
[28:21] what God
[28:22] says I'm glad of that am it's what he
[28:25] says about it's not what me and you has
[28:27] our thought about it you say well you
[28:30] looking for great things I'm looking
[28:32] where the Prophet said there'd be such a
[28:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost come among
[28:35] this bride that would take her in the
[28:39] Rapture said she'd be
[28:42] what what would she be an invincible
[28:46] Army Satan would be powerless before her
[28:50] he said you see thank you seen things
[28:52] you ain't seen nothing yet you like that
[28:56] quote he says he ain't been a Revival
[28:59] yet oh revivals are all over brother
[29:01] Dale all revivals done over what about
[29:04] the one of the Bride he said she ain't
[29:07] had a Revival yet he said it'll take
[29:09] them seven unknown Thunders to wake her
[29:13] up you mean to think that we've had all
[29:16] these seven going into it now almost
[29:18] 7,000 years and God dealing with us and
[29:21] dealing with Abraham and dealing with
[29:23] and dealing with all that and you and I
[29:24] going to walk out of here Glory tomorrow
[29:28] rapture's coming and we're gonna we're
[29:31] gonna sail out of here because it's just
[29:36] done I mean is that your
[29:39] thoughts well I'm going to say what you
[29:42] don't want me to say then you might as
[29:44] well go somewhere else cuz ain't nobody
[29:46] here going to hold it to that that's not
[29:49] an idea that's ever been brought here CU
[29:51] if anybody does I'll go against
[29:53] it because I've always looked for a move
[29:56] of God but I I see God moving there's
[29:59] where the trouble's at people don't see
[30:01] him
[30:03] moving they don't look at one sister J
[30:06] you raise your
[30:08] arm you couldn't raise it here
[30:12] one how many more healings we had things
[30:18] help but he just trying to get you to
[30:21] look at something and it's showing that
[30:23] it's right there in the
[30:25] scriptures that explains what's going to
[30:27] happen
[30:30] see brother randam come and brought his
[30:32] message he was the
[30:35] porter to open the
[30:38] door for you and I to the revelation of
[30:41] Jesus
[30:43] Christ all
[30:45] right but it just keeps
[30:49] opening what about an open door to where
[30:52] you see Jesus Christ Living in you
[30:54] that's a wonderful Open Door isn't it I
[30:57] know I ain't going to get him
[30:58] know that's a wonderful Open Door is
[31:02] it but what about John in Revelations
[31:06] 4 he looked up and saw a door opened in
[31:10] heaven
[31:12] right he was taken up into the
[31:15] revelation of the word of God through an
[31:18] open
[31:19] door you know what there had to be a
[31:21] porter open that
[31:24] door right
[31:28] come on
[31:29] church then you can see it's not just a
[31:31] numbered mathematic I'm trying to get a
[31:33] thought to you it's the thought of a
[31:35] revelation of what's happened in our
[31:38] day right Paul had the opening of he was
[31:42] the porter he opened the message to the
[31:44] people of that
[31:46] day God using him to open that door to
[31:50] speak to the sheep of the sheep
[31:56] fold right
[31:59] but it wasn't long until they started
[32:01] going back
[32:06] down irenius comes forth a door
[32:13] opens the revelation of Jesus
[32:17] Christ he's the porter he's opened it
[32:21] the he's allowing you to look through
[32:23] the temple is that what we gave while
[32:26] ago that the poor 's job was to do to
[32:30] take care of the temple he's to take
[32:31] care of the whole thing he's to even
[32:33] take care of the money he's to take care
[32:34] of the pots and pans he was take he's
[32:37] over the charge of everything and
[32:39] remember I gave you there I said there
[32:40] like what 120 of them or 170 of them
[32:44] this in one place and go back and read
[32:47] that and you'll find out that David
[32:50] under the anointing was the one that set
[32:52] up those
[32:55] Porters go read during chonicles d David
[32:58] set that up under the anointing of the
[33:00] Holy Spirit and put those people in
[33:05] charge you ain't going in you ain't
[33:07] going in the door unless that Porter
[33:08] opens that door for you see somebody's
[33:11] got to help
[33:14] you come on Church can't we simply get
[33:17] it why can't we see that you sisters you
[33:20] can open the door to your
[33:22] children you are in that part of that
[33:25] open door
[33:26] too You Preach to your children you
[33:29] direct them in Jesus Christ you're
[33:31] opening the door to
[33:34] them that they can see
[33:38] Christ what about then go back and read
[33:40] it there where the
[33:42] porters their
[33:48] jobs Jesus said when the son of man
[33:50] would
[33:51] come they'd have to be a porter
[33:57] that somebody had to come and speak to
[33:59] you and I right but are you following me
[34:03] you remember what we saw in Jeremiah 34
[34:07] though we saw that even though the
[34:10] freedom was declared by I believe was
[34:12] that a that's right
[34:14] the high priest and other
[34:18] words when it was over with they went
[34:21] right back and took the same people and
[34:22] put them back in
[34:25] bondage can't you see church that even
[34:27] down Through the Ages it is that age
[34:30] would come forth into Christ it would
[34:33] open a door and a great Revival would
[34:36] happen but 3 years
[34:38] later it starts
[34:42] denominating then you come back to the
[34:44] scriptures that what that the porter
[34:46] That was supposed to been one to open
[34:48] the door what does it say about
[34:50] him Jesus said you
[34:53] Pharisees he said you stand in the door
[34:56] and won't go in your yourself and won't
[34:58] let nobody else go
[35:00] in who is
[35:03] that that's your ideas and my ideas
[35:07] contrary to the word of
[35:10] God well I don't have no ideas I just I
[35:12] just believe everything brother around
[35:14] say it
[35:17] now I don't try to be
[35:20] sarcastic I just try to be truthful I'd
[35:23] be real careful how I slung that
[35:25] statement around here somebody might
[35:28] walk up to you and say uh what about
[35:31] this what about that what about this
[35:34] what about that did you believe
[35:41] everything come on I made this statement
[35:44] I know it it really sounds bad I believe
[35:47] everything that's been revealed to me
[35:49] and what that Prophet
[35:51] said did did you read what I said I said
[35:54] I believe everything that's been
[35:56] revealed to me yes sir right now I don't
[35:59] believe what hadn't been revealed I got
[36:02] head knowledge about it and I believe
[36:04] he's
[36:05] right but I don't know he's right until
[36:08] something happens inside of
[36:11] me to make me
[36:14] right right a revelation to come
[36:16] in and see each one of those
[36:20] Messengers they stood there in those
[36:23] ages and opened the door
[36:29] to the
[36:30] people about Jesus Christ and what he
[36:32] was
[36:34] doing look where it had wound up over
[36:36] there and you'll see what I'm talking
[36:38] about that while I said it about the
[36:40] prophet that said
[36:41] what he said that Holy Ghost has been
[36:45] bound sure we can see it was bound by
[36:48] the denominational people we can see it
[36:50] was bound by that but you realize he's
[36:52] the one that just said it now you read
[36:54] it off of
[36:55] there that the Holy Ghost never was free
[36:59] in the people the way he wanted it
[37:01] right if there is why you got a
[37:06] restoration you see as each Age come
[37:08] forth you'll see that your Porter
[37:10] messenger starting with the Apostle Paul
[37:13] was a
[37:14] wonderful
[37:16] marvelous
[37:18] individual with no denominational
[37:20] thoughts and ideas right amen right am I
[37:24] right amen right
[37:27] irus done real good he stayed with the
[37:31] truth from John we're quoting brother
[37:35] Brown Martin brother Brown said the
[37:38] greatest since the Lord Jesus
[37:43] Christ come on you want we get the
[37:45] quotes for you St Martin even the
[37:49] greatest since the Lord Jesus
[37:52] Christ Columba look what he
[37:55] done but now what what I'm
[38:00] saying then you started the Dark
[38:05] Ages and here comes Martin Luther out as
[38:08] a porter standing in the door and
[38:13] said the just shall live by
[38:18] faith but yet he was a trinitarian to
[38:20] the core I got his own writings he did
[38:23] not want to leave the Catholic church he
[38:26] wanted to read form it cuz he knew he
[38:29] couldn't do nothing else with it that's
[38:30] the best way to say it he he wanted to
[38:33] try to get it straightened
[38:36] up it took him years into his doing that
[38:40] he would finally throw down that thing
[38:42] and say that is not the
[38:48] blood
[38:50] see and he was still
[38:52] bound if you don't believe that I'd ask
[38:55] you to read one little message or listen
[38:56] to it restoration of the Bride
[39:00] tree and read it four death Messengers
[39:03] took it down four life Messengers
[39:05] restores
[39:06] it
[39:10] right man's ideas and Creeds is what's
[39:13] put every one of us in the place we are
[39:15] tonight why are we doing here 50 years
[39:17] after the prophet left
[39:20] us I'm saying as much as I can to you
[39:23] and me it's you and me the problems amen
[39:27] the message has been brought God has
[39:30] delivered the message to it he's given
[39:32] us every opportunity you realize we're
[39:35] the only people that have our Messengers
[39:38] message of his words from day to
[39:42] day over some almost what from the 30s
[39:46] to the
[39:48] 50s the 30 years or 40
[39:51] years that we can read things he
[39:54] said in the beginning
[39:58] a little bit they have about Paul small
[40:02] amount about irenius and Martin and
[40:04] Columba most of it is just a historical
[40:07] types of
[40:09] things you got a few writings of Martin
[40:13] Luther because you had begin to get the
[40:15] printing presses and the things back
[40:17] into motion you had a little more than
[40:19] John
[40:20] Wesley you had a little more in theusa
[40:24] street but I've tried to get you to even
[40:26] think about about that ausa street were
[40:29] trinitarian
[40:31] people well God can't be loose under a
[40:34] trinitarian idea right the Holy Ghost
[40:38] can't work under a trinitarian
[40:44] concept see look what brother R then had
[40:47] to
[40:49] do now I'm going to quote this about a
[40:51] brother that that I won't call his name
[40:54] but a lot of you would know it but he
[40:57] had said something to brother brandham
[40:58] according to what he
[41:00] said he had said something to brother
[41:03] brandham about Malachi
[41:05] 4 and he said you you're Malachi 4 he
[41:08] said you can't tell
[41:12] it he said you can't tell
[41:16] it he forbid the man to
[41:19] tell of what he saw about him as Malachi
[41:21] 4
[41:24] why but my Lord he had trouble like it
[41:26] was
[41:28] trying his best to get along with
[41:30] organized religions and fellowship with
[41:33] them and associate with them
[41:36] and what was he
[41:40] doing he realized he was just sewing
[41:43] seeds for a bride right
[41:45] amen you realize all of that other is
[41:48] just F along the way to be burned one
[41:55] day but he couldn't come out and declare
[41:57] what he was
[42:01] doing did he ever jump up and say you
[42:03] got to believe me now I'm the big
[42:06] guy
[42:11] no he always tried to Humble
[42:14] himself and recognize others as greater
[42:17] than he
[42:20] was but he was a special
[42:23] Porter like I
[42:25] said you may not thank anything
[42:28] whatsoever but that number seven
[42:30] guy he was special but he couldn't get
[42:34] the people totally free because you had
[42:36] to go by the grave even though it was
[42:37] the great Apostle
[42:39] Paul he could speak of the chains but he
[42:42] could not bring it forth right amen why
[42:45] why was it that he could not bring it
[42:46] forth because the Holy Ghost was
[42:50] bound but I don't like for you to say it
[42:52] like that brother Dale you look like
[42:53] you're saying at the Holy Ghost B I
[42:55] didn't say it
[42:58] your Prophet was the one that said it
[43:01] that's right and if you go home tonight
[43:03] and put on any tape in the 50s you'll
[43:06] see him ripping them Pentecostal to
[43:10] smithin because they denominated on his
[43:13] the the Pentecostal
[43:15] message that's right got into the seal
[43:18] book and he said they cabbage down on
[43:23] it cuz the Holy Ghost was never truly
[43:25] free
[43:28] yes but you'll never see the Holy Ghost
[43:29] is free what you're looking at then
[43:31] there'll never be a Rapture that's
[43:33] right I'm not backing up I state that
[43:36] and leave it
[43:38] alone he's either going to be free in a
[43:40] group of people and that's why the
[43:42] prophet would say a little group
[43:46] right you know right now there's
[43:48] probably over 5 million message
[43:54] Believers I don't mind saying it but I
[43:57] don't mind saying the rest of it either
[44:00] how many Christian Believers are there
[44:02] in the
[44:06] world they would be 5 million people
[44:08] that believe this message how many
[44:11] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[44:12] Pentecostals and all of religious people
[44:15] are the in the
[44:16] world millions of millions of millions
[44:19] then 5 million would be a small group if
[44:22] you're not little flock it's still right
[44:24] if there's five million
[44:27] but what if you dropped it back like he
[44:28] says a lot of time what if you went back
[44:31] to the days of
[44:36] Noah eight
[44:39] people oh we don't like to quote a small
[44:44] group with when we quote from Brother
[44:46] brandom do we what did he
[44:49] say you need this one he said I'll doubt
[44:53] a dozen out of this
[44:54] generation making it to the chain
[45:00] you need
[45:04] that cuz remember Noah Ty the foolish
[45:09] virgins and things are the eight Enoch
[45:12] went up by himself you
[45:17] know right that's why he said maybe when
[45:20] I was state so you might as well
[45:24] move because I'm here
[45:27] Danny you going up Tennessee somewhere
[45:29] cuz I'm here there's only one out OFA
[45:31] State you say you're just making life no
[45:33] I'm not making life I'm doing what r r
[45:35] said a small
[45:37] number it don't have to be millions and
[45:39] millions to make it to fulfill his word
[45:43] may I quote brother random he said if he
[45:45] can get one
[45:50] man one man to believe the
[45:55] word right look what he done back there
[45:58] were one man
[46:00] right what if he could get one sister
[46:03] just to believe
[46:04] it oh yeah okay all right what
[46:12] now those ages
[46:16] denominated a little bride came down to
[46:18] there and she'll be
[46:21] there but that's what I like about the
[46:23] rest of the scripture when you come to
[46:25] the seventh age that we're living in you
[46:27] come to Hebrews 11:40 they without us
[46:30] cannot be made
[46:32] perfect we ain't gonna pull them up and
[46:34] preach nothing to them straighten them
[46:35] out no uhuh they're going to raise in
[46:37] Christ like way was bringing out
[46:39] Wednesday night or Sunday the dead in
[46:42] Christ that's an odd way of saying it
[46:44] dead in
[46:45] Christ but those who in Christ that are
[46:48] dead to themselves to walk in newness of
[46:52] Life
[46:55] am see when you're coming down then to
[46:58] the end and a matter of fact I had the
[47:00] title till way preached Wednesday I had
[47:03] the title of the of the end of all
[47:06] things and I had the scripture he gave
[47:09] in First Peter
[47:10] 4 okay that don't bother me I just move
[47:13] over and pick up another scripture and
[47:15] another title messenger at the end of
[47:18] the
[47:20] age but really talking about a
[47:23] porter a porter a messenger to show you
[47:27] what we've
[47:28] had the god called a release every seven
[47:32] years and that went in
[47:36] rotation then when you come down to the
[47:40] 49th that man's got a special message
[47:43] because he
[47:45] declares the Jubilee for the seven amen
[47:48] are you with
[47:49] me Paul declared a jubilee for the age
[47:54] right all right irus declared all each
[47:59] one of them but they never declared a
[48:01] 50 it wasn't there it was a 50 in the
[48:05] release of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[48:07] in your soul amen but it was not a
[48:10] release to take a body out of
[48:13] here but this
[48:16] messenger has a triple
[48:19] job first he starts out in his early
[48:23] Ministry just like Paul
[48:27] would you like some quotes from him when
[48:30] he went beyond the curtain of time what
[48:31] did he
[48:34] say he said will Paul's people be there
[48:37] he said yeah they'll be there he said
[48:41] and I preach just what Paul
[48:44] preached and he said all them people
[48:47] shout and Glory Hallelujah do you
[48:50] realize that a lot of them people he saw
[48:53] when he went beyond the curtain of time
[48:55] now listen
[48:57] were probably
[48:59] trinitarians who got born again in that
[49:03] day are you going to leave FF bosard out
[49:06] of it are you going to leave some of
[49:07] those Jewels out of it I wouldn't walk
[49:10] too much in that if I were
[49:11] you I would try to walk a little
[49:15] soft all
[49:18] right but what about a man that comes
[49:20] along then then when he comes to his
[49:22] time he's got to proclaim a seven-year
[49:24] release
[49:29] and by having a seven-year release
[49:31] there's going to be a certain
[49:32] limitations so you see the
[49:37] prophet he's trying his best to bring
[49:40] forth for the day and the time and the
[49:42] starting
[49:45] out he thought he preached the seals in
[49:47] 5 what 57 did he preach the seals went
[49:51] through him he thought he preached
[49:53] it right you know what he did
[49:57] cuz you know what until that top was
[50:00] whipped off and looked down in there
[50:01] nobody was responsible for that I don't
[50:04] care who says what nobody wasn't
[50:07] responsible for that he wasn't
[50:10] responsible have you ever noticed a
[50:12] statement that he used to make there
[50:14] made quite a bit he said you just say
[50:17] what I say he said and God will hold me
[50:25] responsible good could he have known
[50:27] something could he have known that he
[50:29] wasn't exactly lined up perfectly to the
[50:32] opening of the seals and the thing and
[50:34] yet he knew that his words were still
[50:37] right that the door had opened that he
[50:40] had been a porter to open the
[50:43] word way do we get there and find out
[50:45] the Holy Ghost it started on isusa
[50:48] street just come right on over into
[50:51] brother
[50:53] Brandon right
[50:58] brother R said he called another he said
[50:59] no messenger of the age he said because
[51:01] the Holy Ghost came
[51:03] himself he calls those Messengers on on
[51:07] restoration of rdrye he calls them
[51:10] prophets he calls Luther a prophet he
[51:13] calls Wesley a prophet
[51:18] amen no Messenger to the lady of seean
[51:20] age because the Holy Ghost came
[51:24] himself but remember what the rest that
[51:26] what we said at the end of the
[51:29] age is to come
[51:31] forth I'm just laying a foundation for
[51:34] that because I I just don't
[51:37] feel the drive hard I'm I'm I'm sorry I
[51:40] have to do as I am and forgive me but
[51:43] I'm trying to get you and I to see
[51:45] something and I I just stay with what
[51:48] brother he said hold up the point until
[51:49] he get it and then move on okay I may
[51:52] preach the same thing over and over and
[51:54] over and over and over but one of these
[51:56] days you'll say thank you for preaching
[51:57] that over and over and over I finally
[51:59] got it it finally struck
[52:02] home what has happened cuz I hope you
[52:05] can see what I'm talking about this
[52:07] messenger that fell in the end time that
[52:10] Holy Spirit that started on a zeusa
[52:13] street was bringing the word of God it
[52:16] had already brought truth of the
[52:20] Oneness oh no there all messed
[52:23] up not as messed up as us trying to ter
[52:26] was so don't
[52:29] Crow all
[52:31] right don't Crow you might always stay
[52:34] quiet you say well they just all messed
[52:37] up in
[52:39] Oneness you better talk to God about it
[52:41] because according to your
[52:44] Prophet they were the move of God for
[52:47] the
[52:49] time zeusa Street 1906 was trinitarians
[52:56] you started about 1911 12 right in
[53:00] there and you started with the Oneness
[53:03] Doctrine and listen folks this may blow
[53:06] your little bubble a little bit but all
[53:09] right brother Brandon wasn't the first
[53:12] one who come forth baptizing in the name
[53:14] of the Lord Jesus
[53:17] Christ you know that you go back and
[53:20] read little history they were already
[53:22] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[53:24] Christ before brother ROM come along
[53:30] check your profit andc see you had
[53:33] people that were preaching a lot of
[53:38] truth but none of them could be the
[53:40] messenger so the mankind had to
[53:43] wait so if you understand what I'm
[53:45] saying in the 49th year really you're
[53:48] starting the 48th which would start
[53:50] brother randam at the early part of his
[53:54] ministry and it moves upward it moves
[53:56] upward he enters that seven and he
[53:59] begins to see the message and the
[54:01] opening of the word and seeing those
[54:04] things as it
[54:05] unfold I ask you to check things about
[54:08] it but you how many of you went home and
[54:10] took your your pad down and just read
[54:13] the
[54:14] titles let me ask you a simple
[54:17] question brother brandom in
[54:20] 1957 over and over under thus sayeth the
[54:24] Lord said that
[54:27] MDC was almighty
[54:33] God when the seals broke he preached the
[54:37] message who is this male
[54:40] chesd he'd always preached that Jesus
[54:44] was almighty God and not a second person
[54:46] or third person not even the first
[54:48] person he said he's the de person
[54:51] himself well why did he preach the
[54:53] message over called Christ is the
[54:54] mystery of God revealed
[54:57] and you better remember what he done in
[54:59] that you better remember and who is this
[55:01] m
[55:03] jezdic he took you right back to seeing
[55:05] who mzd was but he brought you to see
[55:08] who mdic is in your own
[55:11] experience
[55:12] right who is this m Christ is the
[55:15] mystery of God reveal what did he bring
[55:19] it I thought he brought a three-fold
[55:21] revelation in that I thought he brought
[55:23] all God was he puted into CH all Christ
[55:25] into the church Church making her part
[55:27] of the
[55:29] mystery making her part of the
[55:31] Revelation and she's got to be revealed
[55:33] that's all I've ever tried to preach is
[55:36] the revealing of the Bride of Jesus
[55:37] Christ because that's what your Prophet
[55:39] come to
[55:42] do how many more do you
[55:45] need of just seeing what he done from
[55:48] that age to this age to this age to this
[55:50] time until God opened that word and just
[55:53] kept opening that word and kept opening
[55:55] the word
[55:57] preached in 1958 serpent seed
[56:01] right he said serpent seed was revealed
[56:03] in the
[56:10] seals are you following
[56:13] me this last day
[56:15] messenger had a special thing cuz he had
[56:19] to declare this release to come under
[56:21] the church age of the seven
[56:27] but then he's got to come at the end of
[56:29] the age to bring his message to declare
[56:32] eternal
[56:37] life about a message what about a man
[56:40] that walked in that
[56:43] realm church I tremble at a little bit
[56:46] that God has revealed to me because
[56:50] there's power in the
[56:52] word and there's power to mislead
[56:57] right there's power into
[57:02] deceiving you so yeah but brother Dale
[57:04] we can't do that just don't ever say you
[57:07] can't do it
[57:10] right just don't ever say that you're a
[57:12] match for the devil un quotes your
[57:14] prophet he said no man is a match for
[57:17] the devil now let's quote the rest of
[57:19] that because we don't leave you on Earth
[57:21] but he said the Holy Ghost in any
[57:23] individual is a match for the devil now
[57:25] then are are we
[57:28] right the Holy Ghost and an individual
[57:30] as a match for the
[57:33] devil thinking about that scripture
[57:35] today all things are possible what to
[57:38] the
[57:38] prophet or to the Lord Jesus Bible
[57:41] doesn't say that says to them that
[57:45] believe but yet do we believe
[57:48] that church I'm just trying to get you
[57:52] to see something and see where you're at
[57:55] and where you're you got got to be
[57:56] called up we've got to move as the
[57:58] messenger
[58:02] moved that's where I know that that
[58:05] people hasn't understood me gropping
[58:06] back into the to the 60s and coming into
[58:09] the 70s that they didn't understand the
[58:11] approach that I was trying to make but
[58:13] it's simply what I'm saying
[58:15] now we give all the honor and glory to
[58:17] the messenger of the hour that brought
[58:19] the message but the messenger of the
[58:22] hour is not The Shepherd of the sheepo
[58:27] the messenger of the hour I'm talking
[58:28] about the porter the guy to bring the
[58:35] message but he stands in a special
[58:40] place is that man back there if you
[58:42] follow me want to do it when it comes to
[58:45] about the 48th year he knows next year
[58:48] there's a Sevenfold and he's got to
[58:49] Proclaim that Liberty but then he looks
[58:52] and he says wait a minute we've already
[58:54] had six we're standing in the 7th the
[58:57] next has got to be a golden jubilee for
[59:01] the
[59:02] 50 and he starts looking at
[59:05] it he starts declaring it proclaiming it
[59:09] you remember Sunday
[59:11] proclaiming announcing it stating it
[59:14] telling it that a jubilee freedom is
[59:19] coming that will have no limitations to
[59:23] it that Christ can come and live in his
[59:26] people the way he always wanted to
[59:31] right you think he wasn't happy with
[59:33] Paul and all of those Brothers on the
[59:35] great Revelation they were trying to
[59:39] bring but you think he wasn't happy with
[59:42] the the great John that stood there
[59:46] proclaiming the coming of the Lord Jesus
[59:50] Christ but the Bible says the least in
[59:53] the kingdom is greater than
[59:59] John the Bible says no man born of a
[1:00:01] woman who was great as John then he see
[1:00:04] when the riter catches he fall he puts
[1:00:06] it in he said but the least in the
[1:00:11] Kingdom you realize where we're
[1:00:14] standing we're standing on the threshold
[1:00:16] of
[1:00:18] Eternity well sure don't look like it
[1:00:21] that's what the scripture says will
[1:00:22] happen people say that we've heard it
[1:00:24] from the beginning
[1:00:27] you know that's the greatest sign that
[1:00:29] is here is when you say you've heard it
[1:00:32] from the beginning and you don't believe
[1:00:34] it that's what the Bible says read your
[1:00:37] Bible That's the greatest sign what
[1:00:40] somebody to come and say oh we've heard
[1:00:43] that from the
[1:00:45] beginning what you want to do shake the
[1:00:47] person's hand and say you know you're in
[1:00:48] the
[1:00:49] Bible right you're right in the middle
[1:00:51] of the Bible just wrong place but you're
[1:00:54] in the Bible
[1:00:58] but listen
[1:00:59] church we talked about Sunday that the
[1:01:03] prophet of God said what that we the
[1:01:06] bride has got to be called
[1:01:08] out of the
[1:01:10] age by the word of
[1:01:15] God he said this is not a Pentecostal
[1:01:19] age you remember all of
[1:01:23] those do we think we're still in
[1:01:25] Pentecost
[1:01:27] no well I'm Pentecost top of my head
[1:01:30] bottom of my feet all right praise the
[1:01:33] Lord is it true
[1:01:37] Pentecost you know what if it is true
[1:01:39] Pentecost you don't have to holler and
[1:01:40] Shout about
[1:01:43] it right it ain't cause you shouting and
[1:01:46] screaming and hollering right you
[1:01:48] remember what I gave you you want me to
[1:01:49] bring that quote to you where brother
[1:01:51] Brandon said the true
[1:01:53] Pentecostals was them back there in the
[1:01:55] old in the people people that killed
[1:01:56] Jesus Christ cuz they were shouting
[1:01:58] Glory Hallelujah and crying and praying
[1:02:00] while they were killing
[1:02:03] him he said how can he make them
[1:02:05] Pentecostal because Pentecostal is not
[1:02:08] Pentecost there's a lot of difference in
[1:02:10] Pentecostal and Pentecostalism and
[1:02:13] through Pentecost Pentecost is
[1:02:16] 50 Pentecostalism is denominationalism
[1:02:27] H I just asked a simple question has the
[1:02:30] Holy Ghost been set
[1:02:39] free what's your answer to that when
[1:02:42] your Prophet said it
[1:02:43] happened well he just see there now
[1:02:46] you're going to doubt the prophet's
[1:02:47] message that's what I'm telling you I'm
[1:02:49] sorry I'm sorry folks for the way I
[1:02:51] preach cuz I preach a one straight
[1:02:54] thing I'm only have one line and it's
[1:02:58] straight I may be as crooked as a dog's
[1:03:00] on leg on everything else but when I
[1:03:03] talk about this word I got one line one
[1:03:05] straight
[1:03:08] thing and that's his word is
[1:03:14] right he said the the this is the bride
[1:03:17] age you remember that
[1:03:20] Sunday bride age we gave it over and
[1:03:23] over and over this is the bride age
[1:03:31] a message was to come forth were to call
[1:03:34] us out because every bride has been
[1:03:36] called out of the age into
[1:03:40] Christ Paul was called out of the
[1:03:43] age into
[1:03:47] Christ now let me
[1:03:52] just do do you want to read those over
[1:03:54] again where brother around talking
[1:03:57] about that the bride is called out of
[1:04:00] this age do you need us to read them
[1:04:01] over again or do you believe what I
[1:04:04] tried to preach
[1:04:05] Sunday that this is the bride age and
[1:04:07] ever age was a bride called out of the
[1:04:10] age into
[1:04:11] Christ until John in this age and I mean
[1:04:14] showing from back there coming here was
[1:04:16] actually taken out of here up into
[1:04:18] heaven we're supposed to be in Heavenly
[1:04:20] places in Christ Jesus in a bright age
[1:04:24] called there by the messenger of Malachi
[1:04:26] 4 open the door to us the porter
[1:04:29] standing in the door opening that door
[1:04:32] to where that we can see Jesus Christ
[1:04:34] and call us out of the age the new
[1:04:37] birth pulls the soul out of the
[1:04:40] age right because it's eternal life but
[1:04:43] he doesn't pull the body
[1:04:46] out but the we gave the scripture in
[1:04:49] Hebrew that he suffered without the gate
[1:04:51] we got to go out to him
[1:04:59] come on Pentecostalism
[1:05:02] denominationalism lady
[1:05:04] oan I gave you the quote Sunday where
[1:05:07] they what they put him out and crucified
[1:05:14] him you see you and I have got to walk
[1:05:17] into the word of the hour and believe
[1:05:21] it well brother D I believe everybody I
[1:05:23] can well praise God
[1:05:26] but let's don't quit just because we
[1:05:28] think we got it we're cavage down on
[1:05:32] it you certainly know for one thing for
[1:05:35] sure that I've not quit preaching and
[1:05:37] I've been preaching this message just
[1:05:38] like this for 40
[1:05:41] years trying to get you and me to see
[1:05:48] it did you see Jesus
[1:05:54] Christ first sermon I preached in 1969
[1:05:58] was that the Bride of Jesus Christ would
[1:06:00] be the son of
[1:06:01] man the word made flesh in the end
[1:06:08] time boy you talking about some looking
[1:06:11] at ain't quite as bad tonight but that
[1:06:13] they sure did look at me then and I kept
[1:06:16] saying over and over brother brandham is
[1:06:19] not the son of man the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:21] is the son of man brother R was a son of
[1:06:23] man we're not talking about becoming a
[1:06:26] son of man because we're not prophets
[1:06:28] but we as a bride of Jesus Christ
[1:06:29] becoming the children of God turn out to
[1:06:31] be the word made flesh and the Earth the
[1:06:33] son of man in the end time I taught that
[1:06:37] from the beginning I'm still teaching
[1:06:39] it but when are we going to believe
[1:06:44] it when are we going to accept
[1:06:47] it we're not into Pentecostal age the
[1:06:51] Pentecostal age is out there
[1:06:55] we're not in the ladyo AG it's out there
[1:06:58] by the new birth we already in
[1:07:01] Christ but we're supposed to be called
[1:07:03] out where he's
[1:07:05] at out of our own ideas and thoughts
[1:07:09] into Christ which is the
[1:07:13] word and to see him living among
[1:07:21] us to see him living in the word
[1:07:28] we were talking about their Sunday I had
[1:07:29] to just back up from it cuz you know
[1:07:31] what I'm talking about when I got on to
[1:07:32] that Sunday where the brother brand said
[1:07:36] the greatest anointing believe it was
[1:07:38] Sunday or the Wednesday before the
[1:07:39] greatest anointing in the world was the
[1:07:42] Lord Jesus
[1:07:43] Christ when he said the spirit of the
[1:07:45] Lord is upon me because he has anointed
[1:07:47] me he turned around he read the
[1:07:48] scripture handed it back to the priest
[1:07:50] and turned around and said I am and said
[1:07:53] this day this scripture is full of
[1:07:57] nobody shouting nobody hollering nobody
[1:08:00] doing
[1:08:01] nothing you remember when brother R got
[1:08:03] over the seal book he said I've seen the
[1:08:06] dead raised he said I've seen the sick
[1:08:07] heal he said I've seen marvelous things
[1:08:10] great things to happen he said but I've
[1:08:13] never worked in the realm that I'm
[1:08:15] working now he said this is the bringing
[1:08:17] of the word by The Same
[1:08:22] Spirit but yet we want to shout and
[1:08:24] Glory Hallelujah I believe in it
[1:08:29] too I believe in it
[1:08:32] too but I just don't put it
[1:08:37] first I put Christ
[1:08:40] first and then the rest of it falls in
[1:08:43] line to where that it can be that and
[1:08:46] see then we're called into the bright
[1:08:48] age out of denominationalism and if we
[1:08:51] ain't called out of that we're still in
[1:08:53] the lady OA
[1:08:58] I think we are brother de well then you
[1:09:00] need to be bed out of the age into this
[1:09:01] message I didn't say that your prophets
[1:09:04] once said it now you see you holler at
[1:09:06] me all the time I'm just telling you
[1:09:07] what he
[1:09:12] said I thought the prophet said she's to
[1:09:14] be
[1:09:15] delivered of a new birth from According
[1:09:19] to Malachi 4
[1:09:25] what's he talking
[1:09:27] about what does adoption bring you
[1:09:31] to when you're born again here your soul
[1:09:33] is totally out of the age and you're
[1:09:35] just climbing higher the age should get
[1:09:38] less
[1:09:42] important what about
[1:09:45] it what about that Porter as he stands
[1:09:50] there and he declares his message
[1:09:58] may I quote him this
[1:10:01] way have you ever notied in spoken words
[1:10:04] Original Seed it's also in the church
[1:10:05] age book but in spoken word Original
[1:10:08] Seed that brother brandham brings his
[1:10:10] message down through message one all the
[1:10:14] way lay laying it down to the word and
[1:10:16] the hour that we're
[1:10:18] living right and how Christ is here and
[1:10:21] what all is taking place and all at once
[1:10:23] he stops
[1:10:27] he said but but as of yet Malachi 4 is
[1:10:31] not
[1:10:33] fulfilled go home and get your spoken
[1:10:35] word book and look it
[1:10:36] up you don't find it be sure and holler
[1:10:39] at me 12:00 tonight I'll find it for you
[1:10:41] stay up all night why because I've been
[1:10:44] quoting it all the time that's what he
[1:10:47] said he said as of yet Malachi 4 is not
[1:10:51] fulfilled that was 1962
[1:10:55] well you know
[1:10:56] what the prophet just quit and went on
[1:10:59] back and decided that no he just kept
[1:11:01] right on going didn't he why because he
[1:11:03] knew that if God told him Malachi 4
[1:11:06] hadn't been fulfilled yet that it meant
[1:11:08] it was going to be fulfilled and he
[1:11:10] believed he just might have something to
[1:11:11] do with it so he just kept on preaching
[1:11:14] and you know what ain't it kind of odd
[1:11:17] God come on the scene and he had
[1:11:18] something to do with him cuz he was a
[1:11:20] porter
[1:11:25] the one who opened the
[1:11:33] door his message is not him I got more
[1:11:36] sense than
[1:11:39] that but what about
[1:11:43] it I don't have enough time to get into
[1:11:45] bringing it all the way down but I do
[1:11:48] want to you to do one
[1:11:50] thing we made a little drawing years ago
[1:11:52] and drawings are good
[1:11:55] and kind of like a brother he he he
[1:11:57] brought me a drawing one time and and he
[1:12:00] he laid it down and he said how do you
[1:12:04] like that he said look at that beautiful
[1:12:07] said this brother draw this and made a
[1:12:10] beautiful drawing said isn't it
[1:12:13] beautiful said it's lined up said he's
[1:12:16] got these things here and he's got this
[1:12:17] here
[1:12:18] and I said
[1:12:20] brother I'm sorry but he ain't right
[1:12:25] where I said right here he's got this is
[1:12:29] supposed to be over here in the
[1:12:30] tribulation and he's got it over here
[1:12:32] with us and us over there and all kind
[1:12:34] of things he you know what he
[1:12:37] said he said was it a pretty
[1:12:42] drawing I said pretty drawing but it's
[1:12:45] pretty
[1:12:46] wrong pretty
[1:12:48] wrong now I want to just give you this
[1:12:51] and I gave you a copy of it a lot of you
[1:12:53] still got them for years ago we've been
[1:12:54] preaching this for years and we ain't
[1:12:56] got no trouble with it just bring up the
[1:12:58] picture we we got together and concluded
[1:13:00] this over the years of trying to bring
[1:13:02] something but we're just talking about
[1:13:03] that Porter for a minute and all we
[1:13:05] going to talk about how he comes at the
[1:13:06] end of the age amen and then Sunday
[1:13:09] we'll pick it back up and go
[1:13:12] on well he come to the end of the age
[1:13:14] well now what age did Paul come to the
[1:13:15] end of did he come at the end of Ephesus
[1:13:18] well then how did he bring the message
[1:13:20] to Ephesus
[1:13:29] well they come to age said they come in
[1:13:30] the age amen but did Paul come at the
[1:13:33] end of
[1:13:35] Ephesus if he did how'd he bring his
[1:13:37] message to
[1:13:43] Ephesus okay so now look we know that
[1:13:48] there was a great happening of God and a
[1:13:49] great move of God called Pentecost amen
[1:13:54] but the Holy Ghost failed on
[1:13:58] Pentecost and for 20 30 years or
[1:14:01] something I I don't know exactly because
[1:14:03] it ain't worried about
[1:14:06] it but that Holy Ghost was doing Mighty
[1:14:09] wonderful things among those in the book
[1:14:11] of Acts and bringing it
[1:14:14] forth but then here comes the Apostle
[1:14:20] Paul Paul said one born out of you see
[1:14:27] Reon you people you know R around said
[1:14:30] that same
[1:14:32] thing talking to the
[1:14:34] Pentecostal Right Here Comes Paul here's
[1:14:38] Ephesus did Paul come over here at the
[1:14:39] end of
[1:14:43] Ephesus now I want you to look at one
[1:14:45] other thing because like I said anytime
[1:14:48] I preach something if I was you I would
[1:14:50] follow it real
[1:14:51] close because I try to progress and not
[1:14:55] not back
[1:15:00] up I try to always add something to it
[1:15:03] to make you
[1:15:05] interested this black represents the
[1:15:09] darkness
[1:15:11] right the light represents the bride
[1:15:15] that true the light almost goes out down
[1:15:17] in the Dark Ages then comes back and it
[1:15:20] puts up a little another and the last
[1:15:22] age goes into total darkness am I right
[1:15:26] you need this quote brother R said I
[1:15:29] left a little
[1:15:31] light because it goes into total
[1:15:36] darkness but he said I left a little
[1:15:41] light I think you'd listen to that
[1:15:44] Porter just a little bit he might be
[1:15:46] able to introduce Christ to
[1:15:49] us if we'd
[1:15:51] listen so Paul didn't come
[1:15:55] at the end of the
[1:15:58] age he come to the end of
[1:16:01] Pentecost because Pentecost LIC it up
[1:16:03] until Paul coming on the
[1:16:06] scene now listen I know my story Peter
[1:16:10] opens the door to the Gentiles right am
[1:16:12] I right now Peter opens the door Peter
[1:16:15] was not the messenger to the
[1:16:17] Gentiles no way and remember these
[1:16:20] Church ages is Gentile that's right this
[1:16:23] whole church ages is Gentile that's
[1:16:25] right amen not Jewish now Jewish people
[1:16:27] back here but it already turned into the
[1:16:30] Gentile
[1:16:32] dispensation it turned into the D
[1:16:34] Gentile dispensation when Paul come
[1:16:36] forth as the
[1:16:38] messenger and do you need Scripture cuz
[1:16:41] he said he said i' I'm I'm the man to
[1:16:44] the Pentecost I'm I'm the man to come to
[1:16:47] bring it to these
[1:16:49] Gentiles he said I didn't want to didn't
[1:16:51] want how to undo it he said God chose me
[1:16:56] God told one of the men to go over there
[1:16:57] and tell him open his eyes and said tell
[1:17:00] him what he's going to take what he's
[1:17:01] going to do and you look at the life of
[1:17:03] the Apostle
[1:17:04] Paul Not only was he fought by the enemy
[1:17:07] around he was fought by the
[1:17:10] church cuz they were the ones trying to
[1:17:13] kill him not just the Jews of the Old
[1:17:18] Testament Peter argued with
[1:17:23] him and he backed
[1:17:26] up he said we might have argued but said
[1:17:29] Paul says things hard to be understood
[1:17:31] we better leave him alone right am I in
[1:17:34] the scripture come look so where does
[1:17:37] your Porter
[1:17:41] fall remember he's got to open the door
[1:17:44] to the church age Paul opened the door
[1:17:46] to
[1:17:47] Ephesus was he the messenger to Ephesus
[1:17:50] that's all I'm asking if that ought to
[1:17:51] be enough sensible was he the messenger
[1:17:53] to Ephesus brother R said he was that's
[1:17:56] right so solves that do we need the
[1:18:00] church ages and go back through them
[1:18:02] that's what I said This is 40 something
[1:18:04] years you
[1:18:07] know look where Paul
[1:18:10] stood we'll get to it
[1:18:12] Sunday the messenger always rebukes the
[1:18:15] previous
[1:18:17] age for getting away from God and brings
[1:18:21] his message
[1:18:25] the porter look where he's
[1:18:28] at he in between the
[1:18:31] ages now let me let me say this is the
[1:18:34] word added okay all right
[1:18:36] listen are you with me this is the word
[1:18:42] added where was this church
[1:18:45] at well it's right here it's dra out
[1:18:47] right where was it
[1:18:53] that you ain't listen to what I've been
[1:18:56] preaching I thought we was to go out to
[1:18:58] where he was at I thought this church
[1:19:00] went out where Paul was
[1:19:05] at oh no Paul's in here come
[1:19:13] on they say I make funny faces around
[1:19:16] here I make funny faces and keep from
[1:19:19] screaming to death and crying to think
[1:19:21] of the carnality of man's mind
[1:19:25] how many times have you read it where
[1:19:27] brother Brown said the messenger come to
[1:19:28] the end of the age and you always put
[1:19:30] Paul at the end of
[1:19:35] Ephesus on the internet system if you're
[1:19:37] out
[1:19:38] there is not that the way you say Paul
[1:19:40] come right here at the end of Ephesus
[1:19:44] but he knew went the messenger to
[1:19:46] Ephesus and you're totally
[1:19:48] mathematically wrong and you're missing
[1:19:50] the whole message that's right go look
[1:19:55] this bride is called out to where this
[1:19:57] Porter is
[1:19:58] at that just ties that together as one
[1:20:02] Loop come on don't
[1:20:06] think it's just trying to explain
[1:20:10] something and look when you get over
[1:20:12] here and brother Ram said there was no
[1:20:15] Messenger to lady
[1:20:18] oia that Porter was the Holy
[1:20:23] Ghost and look where elah Falls in at
[1:20:26] the end of the
[1:20:29] age
[1:20:30] right Elijah didn't fall here at the
[1:20:34] beginning of the age he falls at the end
[1:20:36] of the age because he's going to
[1:20:37] introduce
[1:20:38] eternity we'll pick that up Sunday don't
[1:20:41] have
[1:20:42] time take this home whe and just look it
[1:20:47] over you said well I just can't fit it
[1:20:49] because I see the end of the ages
[1:20:50] business where you're at
[1:20:55] we'll read where brother randam says
[1:20:57] these and tells you where each age
[1:20:59] messenger is and how they come at the
[1:21:02] end of the previous
[1:21:06] age and they bring their message that
[1:21:09] takes off into the that age that he's to
[1:21:11] bring
[1:21:13] it if you bring Paul at the end of
[1:21:15] Ephesus you have no message what's the
[1:21:17] rest of
[1:21:19] Ephesus if you got him coming to end of
[1:21:22] Pentecost that's where he was that's
[1:21:24] right cuz he rebuked the
[1:21:28] Pentecostals right now did Paul not
[1:21:31] rebuke just he didn't rebuke this a
[1:21:33] don't nominal
[1:21:36] Jew he rebuked them people for getting
[1:21:39] away from Jesus's
[1:21:44] message and he started a church age cuz
[1:21:48] you don't have no church ages until you
[1:21:49] come into Gentile dispensation and
[1:21:51] Gentile dispensation means you got to
[1:21:53] have a start
[1:21:55] and I hope you'll follow this and Wade
[1:21:58] will be Sunday afternoon following it up
[1:22:00] so that's fine with me I hope you follow
[1:22:03] it this
[1:22:04] way if you'll look at that drawing
[1:22:06] that's in front of
[1:22:08] you you got seven men named as Church
[1:22:11] age Messengers but you've got eight
[1:22:14] manifestations of
[1:22:17] God you're perfect mathematically to
[1:22:21] where this messenger can declare eternal
[1:22:24] life
[1:22:28] Body Spirit Soul world
[1:22:32] everything he can Proclaim it and his
[1:22:36] message has done
[1:22:40] that what a beautiful time and an hour
[1:22:43] that we're
[1:22:45] living well I saw this brother Dale 40
[1:22:47] years ago praise
[1:22:49] God so did I and I've had the hardest
[1:22:52] time in my life trying to explain it to
[1:22:54] the people of this
[1:22:59] message brother brandom I didn't say it
[1:23:02] brother R said there was no Messenger
[1:23:04] to Lady
[1:23:07] AIA on zeusa street he said because the
[1:23:11] Holy Ghost came
[1:23:15] himself said then after not all the rest
[1:23:17] of the ages he said in the messenger
[1:23:19] sent the end of the
[1:23:22] age now listen I know to
[1:23:25] that you cannot put dates and times in
[1:23:27] those Church
[1:23:28] ages some of them were dead before they
[1:23:31] even started the message was proclaimed
[1:23:33] a
[1:23:35] stark
[1:23:37] right come on we've been around long
[1:23:39] enough to read but you're not getting
[1:23:42] the point the point is the message to
[1:23:44] the age the point that brother brandom
[1:23:46] emphasized was what what did he
[1:23:49] emphasize about the
[1:23:50] porter the one that was the closest to
[1:23:54] the original
[1:23:59] truth is the way the Holy Spirit picked
[1:24:02] the church AE
[1:24:05] Messengers he didn't say he picked them
[1:24:07] the Holy Spirit picked come on
[1:24:10] musicians think on these
[1:24:14] things a
[1:24:16] porter and Jesus declaring there and
[1:24:20] says the porter opened the door
[1:24:27] and it was his voice not listen it was
[1:24:30] not the Porter's voice listen read your
[1:24:32] scripture over we'll read it again it
[1:24:34] wasn't a Porter's voice that called the
[1:24:36] people out it was the voice of Jesus
[1:24:39] Christ he just opened the
[1:24:41] door the voice of Jesus Christ is what
[1:24:44] called him out said they come out and
[1:24:46] they followed and went
[1:24:48] forth what about
[1:24:50] it what about it let's Stand Together
[1:24:54] what about a great
[1:24:57] time that we can follow this message all
[1:25:00] the way to the
[1:25:01] end and put it right back in the Old
[1:25:04] Testament in the
[1:25:06] scriptures and declare
[1:25:10] it to be still the porters guarding the
[1:25:15] temple that was their job they face
[1:25:19] north south east and
[1:25:21] west looked over the city
[1:25:26] you can get it so close if you'll read
[1:25:27] it you get so close until it looks like
[1:25:30] the Porter is the one who does it but
[1:25:33] then you got to go back to the Watchman
[1:25:34] what of the
[1:25:37] night when it went out into the city you
[1:25:40] picked up from the Porter and your
[1:25:42] Watchman started and he went
[1:25:46] away read your Bible it's all I ask you
[1:25:49] to
[1:25:50] do those Porters had a special place
[1:25:55] look at all the things that they were to
[1:26:01] handle what about God putting it to
[1:26:03] where that he put it right down in where
[1:26:06] the son of man coming on the
[1:26:11] scene and he says the porter open the
[1:26:15] door then I call my
[1:26:19] children my
[1:26:21] sheep and they go forward hearing my
[1:26:23] voice
[1:26:25] there another voice they won't hear now
[1:26:27] this is what I
[1:26:28] like see there's got to be somewhere in
[1:26:31] our lives of you and I all
[1:26:34] together there was a time that brother
[1:26:36] brandham became so personal with what he
[1:26:38] was
[1:26:39] saying
[1:26:41] until it was the very person of God
[1:26:43] speaking through
[1:26:45] him you believe
[1:26:48] that uh want you go back there in the
[1:26:51] Old Testament and pick it up a little
[1:26:53] bit
[1:26:55] and see how that
[1:26:56] that Thomas David would say what he did
[1:27:01] and see how Solomon would say what he
[1:27:03] did and how they declare they pierced my
[1:27:05] hands and my feet speaking in the very
[1:27:08] person of
[1:27:11] God getting very close is it we just
[1:27:15] know not to cross the line
[1:27:19] that's a Razor's Edge the prophet would
[1:27:22] call it just don't fall on the wrong
[1:27:25] side the
