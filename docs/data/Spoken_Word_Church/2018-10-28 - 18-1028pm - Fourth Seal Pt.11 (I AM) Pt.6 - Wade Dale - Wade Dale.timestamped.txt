[26:17] but we're either seen it already come to
[26:19] pass seeing it come to pass living it
[26:23] come to pass
[26:24] so it's it's not far so we see that we
[26:29] know this things that'll happen to
[26:31] Israel that's not pertaining to us but
[26:33] we should do get the spiritual part of
[26:34] it though and we see that God did have a
[26:39] time for Israel but the Gentile time is
[26:41] now and then it's going back to the time
[26:44] of Israel when we get out of here so
[26:46] they're waiting truely waiting on us to
[26:49] get out of the way so the thinking they
[26:51] can receive their message the whole
[26:53] world is groaning and waiting so am i

[32:00] started dear lord thank you so much for
[32:03] giving us a day to come out here Lord we
[32:04] are just human beings and we
[32:08] have a certain time of the year Lord
[32:09] that we have to make all these
[32:11] announcements and but Lord is for your
[32:13] people if your people Lord we're all
[32:16] still humans and we have human things to
[32:18] do Lord and I I think you told you
[32:21] disciples one day let's go take a little
[32:22] vacation so Lord you had a time that you
[32:25] went and rested up and did some things
[32:28] Lord that was that was fun with this
[32:31] disciples Lord and I pray that the
[32:32] things that we do at this church like
[32:34] what we did yesterday will be pleasing
[32:36] to you Lauren that we just enjoy ourself
[32:39] as humans and his families and bring our
[32:41] children in up in the admonition of the
[32:44] Lord that they may see that this is
[32:47] truly not some dull Christianity is not
[32:50] not a dull moment I don't think Lord I
[32:52] think it's I believe that it's it's an
[32:55] exciting time for us to be here it's an
[32:57] exciting time and exciting place to be
[32:59] father just pray that you'd forgive us
[33:02] of our sins and our many mistakes that
[33:03] we do make towards you Lord just cover
[33:05] them by the blood sanctifies for this
[33:07] journey Lord be with the missionaries on
[33:09] the foreign fields give them fruit for
[33:11] their labor probably give us this day
[33:12] our daily bread and Jesus name we pray
[33:14] amen and and before I forget it all the
[33:19] ones that that helped yesterday and it
[33:21] was that yesterday was probably the best
[33:24] we had had in a long time yeah you can
[33:27] go ahead and give yourself up I told
[33:34] them at the post office of the day I
[33:35] said if nobody pat you on the back all
[33:37] you got to do is extend that right arm
[33:38] raise it up like this and go that's
[33:41] stuff on the back but you did a real
[33:42] good job everything was great
[33:44] the singing afterwards those of you
[33:46] didn't stay man we had a service and
[33:49] then people got up and just sang and we
[33:51] had our little PA system and Richard
[33:53] played his bass and Aaron played the
[33:56] guitar and everybody sang we had a real
[33:58] good time so we missed the ones that
[34:01] weren't there we wish you could all come
[34:03] but that's okay I like being around
[34:09] people that are Christian you know you
[34:11] rub shoulders with all the other junk
[34:12] the rest of the time it's kind of nice
[34:15] to be you feel clean you know you feel
[34:16] cleaner than when you're around I mean
[34:19] you feel cleaner when you're around
[34:20] Christian people because you know
[34:21] there's there's some other spirit lords
[34:25] there they man disappeared the Lord's
[34:27] there so when he had opened the fourth
[34:29] seal now we're been on a for sale now
[34:31] for 11 times so we're kind of winding it
[34:34] down I want to get to something today
[34:35] maybe we can bring this to a close I
[34:40] heard the voice of the fourth beast say
[34:41] come and see and I looked and beheld
[34:43] behold a pale horse and his name that
[34:45] sat on him was death and hell followed
[34:47] with him now they have names and power
[34:49] was given unto them over the fourth part
[34:51] of the earth to kill with the sword with
[34:52] a hunger and with death and with the
[34:53] beasts of the earth let's think let's do
[34:56] one more before we sit down John 11
[34:58] Martha said unto Jesus Lord if thou
[35:00] hadst been here my brother had not died
[35:02] but I know that even now whatsoever thou
[35:04] will ask him God God will give it to
[35:07] thee jesus said unto her thy brother
[35:09] shall rise again Martha said unto him I
[35:13] know that he shall rise again in the
[35:15] resurrection at the last day
[35:16] she's putting it off jesus said unto her
[35:19] I am the resurrection and the life he
[35:23] that believeth in me though he were dead
[35:24] yet shall he live and whosoever liveth
[35:27] and believeth in me shall never die
[35:30] believe if doubt this you may be seated
[35:32] in the Lord as a blessing to the reading
[35:34] or believe us thou this now I was
[35:38] thinking as there's a sometimes when
[35:42] you're when you bring in something you
[35:44] have points and you think of a point and
[35:47] you go by it and you go over that point
[35:49] and I know most you ministers know what
[35:50] I'm talking about and then then you
[35:52] think man I've covered that point and
[35:53] then you go no it's a little something
[35:56] extra there's another thing that you
[35:58] want to bring out well you know what
[35:59] it's nice like Regina said this morning
[36:01] sister Regina we were talking about
[36:03] we've been in Romans 9 for a while and
[36:05] and we kind of got off of Romans 9
[36:08] yesterday I mean last Sunday and she
[36:10] said well you're not reading this thing
[36:12] and I'm not you know we we start running
[36:15] the thing we put our own ideas in it but
[36:17] we let the Lord lead us in the way that
[36:19] we need to go sometimes even though you
[36:21] may think we go down a rabbit trail but
[36:23] that's okay it may be for somebody but
[36:25] not you
[36:26] the preacher may go down a rabbit trail
[36:29] for you one of these days and you'll
[36:31] enjoy that or somebody besides you may
[36:33] not enjoy it but you will
[36:35] so that's what we're trying to now I
[36:36] want you to see to that that we in all
[36:39] that we're looking at when we come to
[36:41] this fourth seal to me it's important
[36:44] because of bring up the remember part
[36:47] death has to be destroyed a restoration
[36:51] of all things take place a resurrection
[36:54] as the plate take place and a rapture
[36:56] takes place on this seal so the seal is
[36:58] like brother Dale said going I want you
[37:00] to understand well from last Sunday when
[37:04] we finished up last Sunday and we
[37:05] brought where brother Branham came at
[37:07] the end of the Pentecostal age I didn't
[37:09] make this point I want to make that
[37:11] point that that was the son of man
[37:13] ministry you can't have that the son of
[37:17] God works all the way even the Son of
[37:19] God mystery of the revelation of the Son
[37:23] of God comes all the way to now I was
[37:25] telling them this morning you have to be
[37:28] really you have to be able to do like
[37:30] the Bible says and separate the soul
[37:32] from the spirit and the body and bring
[37:34] these things in because if you don't
[37:36] you'll get confused amen so we come to a
[37:39] place to where Martin Luther received
[37:42] the Holy Ghost for his time in his hour
[37:44] amen and it was the true Holy Ghost but
[37:47] that true Holy Ghost never anointed that
[37:50] Trinitarian doctrine that he had
[37:52] couldn't can't but it winked at the
[37:56] ignorance of the man because of the tree
[37:59] that was eat down the word part that was
[38:01] eaten down then that wasn't March for
[38:04] Martin Luther to do only the just shall
[38:08] live by faith
[38:09] now I'm sure he preached everything else
[38:10] but God anointed that just shall live by
[38:13] faith
[38:13] God anointed in Martin of John Wesley's
[38:17] time sanctification live a holy life do
[38:20] the things right have a method of doing
[38:22] things then the Pentecostals come in in
[38:25] 1906 and it's very important to realize
[38:27] this in 1906 Azusa Street the Holy Ghost
[38:30] didn't fall on a group of Pentecostals
[38:34] and their doctrine of the Trinity are
[38:37] their doctrine of eternal hell it fell
[38:41] on a restoration of the gift because
[38:43] that's what was promised that was their
[38:45] box that God was working in there
[38:48] right with that say man that way we can
[38:50] understand how God works in this program
[38:52] that when we come to the end or the to
[38:55] that Laodicean Church age and we see
[38:57] that a messenger or that eighth not an
[39:00] eighth messenger but it is really an
[39:01] eighth the anointing of the eighth is
[39:03] that brother branham's message was
[39:05] restoring us by shaving off all this
[39:08] stuff that we were that we lost down
[39:11] through the ages and then we come to a
[39:14] time to where he brings his message now
[39:15] when he brings his message his message
[39:17] is truly eternal life now all the other
[39:21] messages were too but this is the
[39:23] eternal life for this guy for this guy
[39:26] that was to step up and that's what
[39:29] we're going to read you in just a little
[39:30] while we're brother Bram says it's a
[39:32] different anointing I'll read it to you
[39:38] that's why I'm in tally mentality has
[39:41] been done through the church ages live a
[39:43] good Christian life even brother Branham
[39:45] on the sixth seal he said go old as you
[39:47] are see they were still in that
[39:50] Pentecostal age hello go on as you are
[39:54] believe the same what was the same
[39:56] simple message what brother man had
[39:59] brought him to know eternal hell baptism
[40:02] in name Lord Jesus Christ one God
[40:04] revelation all the things that was lost
[40:06] in the church ages he had brought him to
[40:08] a position and he said okay you can't go
[40:11] any further than this because they were
[40:14] called any age that all right I'm just
[40:17] backing up a little bit on last week
[40:19] because they were called in that
[40:21] Pentecostal age the Pentecostal age
[40:23] doesn't take a body change but when
[40:26] brother Branham was standing AIDS has
[40:27] gone from you it's not for you and
[40:30] you're not going to get it well I wasn't
[40:33] there you weren't there some of you may
[40:35] have been there but we're here now we
[40:38] have moved in to the message of eternal
[40:42] life now they've had a message all down
[40:45] through the ages I think about this the
[40:46] other day they've had a message like I
[40:48] said Martin Luther how to mention
[40:49] wasteland a message but no one had a
[40:51] message that could bring that same man
[40:56] Jesus that same ministry back on the
[40:59] earth
[41:00] except the prophet william branham when
[41:02] he opens those seven seals because that
[41:04] was the whole bar that's why he stood at
[41:06] the door and knocked I will read it in a
[41:08] minute but I wanted you to see that when
[41:10] we put that chart up there you got it
[41:12] with you
[41:12] that last part when brother Branham
[41:14] comes at the end of the Pentecostal age
[41:16] he brings his message of the Son of Man
[41:19] I don't think I made that clear but that
[41:23] is the message that he brought because
[41:26] listen let's just be real just think for
[41:30] me a minute Jesus is standing somewhere
[41:34] in an eternal body glorified eternal
[41:39] body we know his spirit and soul was
[41:42] always eternal but you've got an eternal
[41:43] body amen but that eternal body in that
[41:47] form can't come back here until you and
[41:51] I get a body change just like his
[41:56] glorious body we read that scripture how
[41:58] many times you read that scripture will
[42:00] have a body like in his glorious body
[42:01] and we put it where somewhere in the
[42:06] heavenlies no folks will have it right
[42:11] here
[42:11] will either we won't we'll either have
[42:14] it here listen we're gonna have it
[42:16] anyway
[42:17] whether we all fell over dead today in
[42:22] our natural body you're gonna get a
[42:24] glorified body because those who he is
[42:26] justified he is all read I mean
[42:28] justified he's already what glorified I
[42:32] know I know tell your body that in the
[42:35] morning when you wake up I know but you
[42:40] got to believe that you got to believe
[42:43] that that's something you got to believe
[42:45] because we can't push it on to somebody
[42:47] else we got to believe it today that the
[42:51] son of man is not coming the son of man
[42:53] is here but the son of man couldn't do
[42:55] it just in one man named William Branham
[42:59] he wasn't the son of man he was
[43:02] revealing or what he was giving us the
[43:06] son of man amen I mean he's waiting on
[43:10] us with the message he brought
[43:13] but he had to be a mini membered body
[43:15] couldn't have been one man because if
[43:19] brother Brandon listen if he stood there
[43:20] as like I always said before when
[43:24] brother branham's said that
[43:27] denominational churches were nothing but
[43:29] lodges you look so maybes talk to people
[43:33] that they're just this all is is a large
[43:35] meet-and-greet you know drink coffee in
[43:37] the sanctuary and smoke a cigarette in
[43:39] the back you know and talk about what
[43:41] baseball football what happened today
[43:42] before now it's just become a social
[43:45] event but to you and I it has to become
[43:48] eternal life it has to become us
[43:50] building something they're not building
[43:53] nothing they're looked at well you know
[43:55] what they're waiting they're waiting on
[43:56] a kingdom to come and Jesus did say thy
[44:00] kingdom come but they missed the kingdom
[44:04] coming on the day of Pentecost because
[44:07] that's when the kingdom come established
[44:09] itself on the earth as the cornerstone
[44:11] but we're not looking at Cornerstone now
[44:14] we're looking at the thing that's going
[44:16] to cap it off and seal everything
[44:17] together so that we can get out of here
[44:19] so that God can literally change our
[44:22] body that's why I like that word in that
[44:23] second part of the quote to brother
[44:25] Brent that brother Dale always close
[44:26] literally turn us back literally is not
[44:31] something that you know you you're not
[44:33] looking for me to come I'm here I'm
[44:37] literally here I'm not a type I'm me
[44:42] same way with Jesus you say well the
[44:44] bride is the type of Christ be careful
[44:47] Eve was not a type of Adam
[44:50] she was Adam made manifest in another
[44:54] form called Eve so you and I have got to
[44:57] come to a place where Gina I'm off my
[44:59] notes what you say that for this morning
[45:00] we got to come to a place to where
[45:02] that's gotta happen you got to believe
[45:05] when he said I and my father are one you
[45:07] got to believe you say I my father one
[45:09] because when Jesus stood up one day
[45:11] we're going to read it when Jesus stood
[45:13] up Dan said you got to eat my flesh and
[45:16] you got to drink my blood or you'll have
[45:19] no part with me what have we come to
[45:24] sure they / took of the guy
[45:27] in all the ages they had their part but
[45:30] you and I have the full body
[45:33] seven-course meal the full body back in
[45:37] manifestation that all right so let's
[45:43] read here we'll get to something maybe
[45:46] reading them quote number one-third
[45:48] exodus we've read these before so but I
[45:53] like this one I'm gonna keep this one I
[45:55] made this petition on my refrigerator we
[45:59] put everything else on our refrigerator
[46:00] so that's the way it is again today God
[46:02] is calling his elected people and they
[46:05] are elected now now remember election is
[46:09] what God voted for you the devil voted
[46:11] against you you swing the vote
[46:12] two-to-one neither way we learned that
[46:14] this morning in Sunday school class so
[46:17] that's what election is election goes by
[46:20] foreknowledge they're all connected amen
[46:24] and now they are elected for what now
[46:28] you talk about us we're elected for a
[46:31] resurrection and what kind of sign is he
[46:33] showing them resurrection sign now when
[46:36] brother Branham would stand even when
[46:38] the Lord Jesus would stand and heal
[46:40] people all day long that was a
[46:42] resurrection sign brother Branham would
[46:45] come and and and have prayer lines for
[46:47] six or seven days straight back in his
[46:49] early ministry that was a resurrection
[46:51] sign but that wasn't the fullness that
[46:57] wasn't the fullness because I'll say a
[47:00] hundred percent of the people brother
[47:02] Branham prayed for has died I'd say
[47:06] close to 100 it's been a long time
[47:09] amen and I may they may be one percent
[47:12] left but they've all you understand what
[47:14] I mean though they've not come to a
[47:16] place to where that body can just
[47:18] continue to be eternal there was
[47:21] something dead changed they did listen
[47:23] when you have AG order and the Gorter
[47:26] disappears you had a body change when
[47:30] you had cancer all over your body and
[47:32] you were leaking fluid I never you know
[47:34] your eyes and nose of that girl was that
[47:36] brother man prayed for remember she was
[47:38] they brought her in in the sheet she had
[47:39] two blood
[47:40] old everything everywhere now when she
[47:42] got up and walked off that girl got a
[47:43] body change something changed there was
[47:46] atoms that changed something broke loose
[47:49] now our situation is is we glory in that
[47:55] but we stop we stop and go that was a
[47:59] good healing service that's gone the
[48:06] next day we had to have another great
[48:08] healing service the next day we had to
[48:11] have another great healing service why
[48:14] because we are going down in these
[48:16] bodies but now Jesus we come out of the
[48:19] grave with a glorified body hit the next
[48:20] day he didn't have to have his sounds
[48:22] regenerated no he was in the core of our
[48:24] body so that's what you and I but you
[48:27] didn't it early say well that's far
[48:28] fetched well how far you want to go how
[48:32] far fetched is it when you get a healing
[48:36] in your body you get a temporary
[48:38] resurrection and then your body is
[48:41] brought up to the place to where that
[48:43] thing's dying but in a moment of time
[48:47] your body is brought back and quickened
[48:50] into a resurrection temporary but now
[48:54] listen Jesus when he said I am the
[48:57] resurrection and the life
[48:58] he went on by the temporary resurrection
[49:00] now he did cause one to happen with
[49:03] Lazarus by temporary resurrection but
[49:07] Lazarus later on passed away now when we
[49:10] see this son of man standing on the
[49:12] earth today come on people when we see
[49:14] that today that's not praying getting
[49:18] better getting worse getting better
[49:20] getting worse we're going to come to a
[49:22] place to where something's going to
[49:23] sweep over us and it's going to what
[49:27] change us in a moment in the 2009 but we
[49:32] have to go through something before that
[49:33] happens we'll try to cover that a little
[49:36] bit today but you and I we are elected
[49:39] for a resurrection so that's our job
[49:42] that's our mandate is to take this thing
[49:46] to a resurrection a body change and a
[49:50] rapture that all right
[49:55] I'm gonna read you a quote in a minute
[49:57] what brother Bram said about a rapture
[49:59] my shotgun who is this son of man let's
[50:02] pull it out Nellis let's I told them
[50:04] we're gonna look at the characteristics
[50:07] I've been going back to reading Matthew
[50:09] Mark Luke and John again because if you
[50:10] want to know what the Son of Man look
[50:12] like act like and talk like read Matthew
[50:15] Mark Luke and John because remember when
[50:19] he come back on the day of Pentecost
[50:21] that was the son of God revelation that
[50:23] was the son of God in Peter the Son of
[50:25] God and Paul the Son of God and James
[50:27] and John and Peter and all them but if
[50:30] you want to know what the Son of Man
[50:32] said go to Matthew Mark Luke and John
[50:35] that's his characteristic that is the
[50:39] only time you're going to see Jesus
[50:42] Christ standing on earth not now then
[50:49] I'm talking about the man the person the
[50:53] one that came out of the womb not milk
[50:55] as a you say well what about this
[50:57] one none of those were your brother
[51:00] none of those even though that was God
[51:03] Almighty that walked in front of either
[51:05] of Abraham and Sarah that was not your
[51:08] Savior that flesh of that man call
[51:11] Melchizedek could not take stripes for
[51:14] you yet that was Almighty God standing
[51:18] there but that wasn't the son of man
[51:21] that was the son of God used in what
[51:24] elements of the earth in creating a body
[51:27] did his service and then stepped out of
[51:30] it and he was done captain of the hosts
[51:34] same way but when a man came like you
[51:37] and I come when we had we were born of a
[51:41] woman out of a woman he was born out of
[51:43] a womb he started as a baby he had dirty
[51:45] diapers he threw live he was a yeah he
[51:49] was a human that was the son of man that
[51:52] was the son of man so if let's look and
[51:55] see what the son of man did and it
[51:59] should answer our question all right he
[52:02] answered the senator them he that soweth
[52:03] the good seed is the son of man so
[52:06] listen letter
[52:07] we this man when he came on the earth
[52:08] there's nothing not have a wife to
[52:11] procreate with okay I was here 52 451
[52:20] says who can declare this man's
[52:22] generation he was cut off from the land
[52:26] of the living why he was killed before
[52:27] he could have children literal children
[52:30] he had no progeny he had no generation
[52:34] change he had no he didn't further his
[52:36] he didn't have sons and daughters like
[52:38] we have sons and daughters a man but he
[52:41] had sons and daughters because he
[52:44] planted the seed in the earth he planted
[52:47] the seed where did it come from it came
[52:49] from his mouth if Adam and Eve would
[52:51] have stayed with instead of instead of
[52:53] protecting of what they per took of then
[52:55] we would have been fine we would have
[52:57] come spoken we're children because you
[52:58] know what that's what we're ending up as
[52:59] I spoken-word see children hey man so
[53:03] the good seed is the son of is the son
[53:05] of man the sower of the good seed so
[53:07] what when Jesus in Matthew Mark Luke and
[53:09] John every sermon that's ever been
[53:11] preached since the dawn of the day of
[53:14] Pentecost till today has been that
[53:19] three-and-a-half-year message of Jesus
[53:21] you said what about the Old Testament
[53:23] didn't the Old Testament speak in him
[53:25] the whole Old Testament spoke of Jesus
[53:28] Christ and then the whole prophets that
[53:30] that preached their sermon spoke of
[53:33] Jesus Christ
[53:34] so Jesus Christ that
[53:35] three-and-a-half-year sermon how many
[53:36] billions of sermons have come off of
[53:38] that man we call the son of man but you
[53:40] know what not over one percent of them
[53:43] understood who he was this day today is
[53:46] the only day we understand who he is the
[53:49] field is the world the good seed are the
[53:51] children of the kingdom so what did he
[53:53] so he sold you and me he give us an
[53:57] opportunity to come the way we were
[53:59] supposed to come by spoken word that's
[54:02] why brother Dale keeps telling us the
[54:05] birth the new birth is the birth of the
[54:08] word it's the birth of the seed he that
[54:12] soweth the good seed remember the the
[54:15] parable the seed is the word he sowed
[54:18] the word if
[54:19] on your foot a minute the field is the
[54:23] world the good seat of the children the
[54:24] kingdom but the tares are the children
[54:25] looking one because remember Satan sow
[54:28] seed - he's sown seed in your brain
[54:31] right now now it's up to you whether to
[54:34] cultivate it or kick it out what are you
[54:39] doing with weeds pull it up
[54:42] we put we putting roundup on it now we
[54:44] don't pull them up no more we just put
[54:46] roundup well that's right liquid weed
[54:49] eater that's exactly right
[54:51] Susan loves that liquid weed even listen
[54:56] that's what we're using we're using a
[54:58] gospel to get rid of the weeds so we're
[55:02] giving it a pill when Jesus came to the
[55:04] coasts of Caesarea Philippi he asked his
[55:05] disciples whom do men say that I the Son
[55:08] of Man am and they said some say you're
[55:11] John the Baptist some say you're Elijah
[55:14] and others Jeremiah or one of the
[55:17] prophets he said are there but now
[55:18] what's your revelation I don't care what
[55:23] all these other people say what do you
[55:25] say
[55:26] in other words guys you live with me
[55:29] everyday you're with me the whole time
[55:32] what if I reveal to you about me that's
[55:36] what he's saying
[55:37] whom say ye that I am and the only thing
[55:41] Peter could say was because look there's
[55:44] never been a man born like Jesus Christ
[55:46] no one they never met anybody born like
[55:49] that and Simon Peter answered said thou
[55:52] art the Christ or the Anointed One the
[55:56] Son of the Living God now he did not
[55:58] answer the question we know that we've
[55:59] been through this for years Peter only
[56:02] and look jesus answered and said blessed
[56:05] art thou simon barjona for flesh and
[56:07] blood didn't reveal that to you he spoke
[56:15] something he didn't really understand
[56:18] until the day of Pentecost and I say
[56:22] undelete that wasn't flesh and blood
[56:24] hath not revealed it unto thee but my
[56:26] father which is in heaven because that's
[56:31] a revelation that Peter was going to
[56:32] open the doorway
[56:34] he wasn't going to open the door with
[56:35] the Son of Man revelation he was going
[56:37] to open the door remember Paul Peter I
[56:40] mean he's got the keys to the kingdom
[56:42] and I say unto thee thou art Peter and
[56:45] upon this rock a revelation I will build
[56:48] my church and the gates of Hell shall
[56:50] not prevail against it
[56:53] you know what that done that that loose
[56:56] that turned that key when Peter come
[56:59] under there Pentecost and said this is
[57:00] that this is that which was spoken by
[57:03] Joel he goes back to the Old Testament
[57:05] I'll give unto thee the keys of the
[57:06] kingdom whatsoever thou shalt bind on
[57:08] earth shall be bound in heaven
[57:09] whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[57:10] shall be loosed in heaven but he never
[57:13] told him the only time listen the only
[57:16] time that could be answered is now I was
[57:18] telling in Sunday school class right now
[57:21] we can answer that question who two men
[57:25] say i the son of man am you an hour to
[57:27] be able to tell him that because you
[57:30] know what when you tell him that that
[57:31] means he's present well if that don't
[57:38] excite you did Aaron what does that do
[57:40] when they don't you spoon fill out your
[57:43] bowl or whatever listen that don't stir
[57:45] your soul your spoon fill out your bowl
[57:48] so I guess some of you got too much bowl
[57:51] of chili yesterday and you gonna sleep
[57:53] some I
[57:55] I'd say German chocolate cake but Susan
[58:00] got one yesterday and that wouldn't keep
[58:03] me awake sorry anyway so let's go to the
[58:07] next one we laugh a little bit but this
[58:11] is serious because look watch what Jesus
[58:14] says jesus said unto them verily verily
[58:17] I say unto you except you eat the flesh
[58:20] of the son of man and drink his blood
[58:23] you have no life in you whoso eateth my
[58:27] flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal
[58:30] life and I will raise him up in the last
[58:36] days now somebody like to tell me
[58:41] Woody's dome out because
[58:46] he really has not given them a spiritual
[58:49] meaning here it is underlying but he's
[58:52] telling them because you say he keeps on
[58:53] for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood
[58:57] is drink indeed so in other words he's
[58:59] saying I know what you're thinking but
[59:01] my flesh is indeed what I'm saying my
[59:04] flesh is meat and my blood is drink he
[59:06] that is my flesh flesh and drinketh my
[59:08] blood dwelleth in me and I in him as the
[59:13] living father has sent me and I live by
[59:15] the father so he that eateth me even he
[59:18] shall live by me now he didn't say live
[59:20] by the father he said live by him this
[59:27] is that bread which came down from
[59:29] heaven not as your father's did eat
[59:32] manna and our dead know we know what if
[59:34] you'll punch that in your computer that
[59:36] little word dead means eternally
[59:37] separated but he's talking about the
[59:40] people in the wilderness he that eateth
[59:41] of this bread shall live forever now
[59:45] look that word eat I looked up the word
[59:48] eat eat and eat if you see that word
[59:50] says eateth eateth scroll it back down
[59:55] again no right there dear that's not
[1:00:01] just one time brother BAM said we're
[1:00:04] feeding off the body word of the son of
[1:00:07] man
[1:00:07] right we're feeding now we're not we get
[1:00:10] one meal and that's it we're feeding off
[1:00:12] the body word of the son of man
[1:00:14] now that word eat means to consume or
[1:00:18] partake you know they eat an apple in
[1:00:23] the garden well they didn't eat an apple
[1:00:26] in the garden they per took of something
[1:00:28] right so you have to look at what that
[1:00:30] what Jesus is saying that when you eat
[1:00:33] the flesh of the Son of Man and a drink
[1:00:35] drink his blood if you don't do that you
[1:00:37] have no life in you now heal it now
[1:00:40] except you consume or partake listen you
[1:00:45] know what this did right here this drove
[1:00:48] people from him but that's the truth
[1:00:53] that's the truth
[1:00:54] but that grow people from him for a
[1:00:57] purpose because nobody ever heard that
[1:00:59] before
[1:01:00] let's keep going these things said he in
[1:01:03] the synagogue he said that in the church
[1:01:08] many therefore of his disciples when
[1:01:11] they heard this said this is a hard
[1:01:13] saying who can hear it when Jesus knew
[1:01:16] in himself that his disciples murmured
[1:01:18] at it he said unto them does this offend
[1:01:22] you because I'm sure in their humanity
[1:01:27] listen in their humanity they're going
[1:01:28] oh we got to eat this guy's flesh and we
[1:01:32] got to be a vampire you know and a drink
[1:01:35] is blood I mean Wow
[1:01:38] does this offend you what and if you
[1:01:43] shall see the Son of Man ascend up where
[1:01:46] he was before it is the spirit that
[1:01:51] quickeneth now watch he just told them
[1:01:54] to eat his flesh and they would partake
[1:01:56] of him right
[1:01:59] it looks like he's contradicting himself
[1:02:02] the flesh prophet is nothing so he's
[1:02:06] telling him right there he's cutting
[1:02:07] them off he said I'm not talking about
[1:02:08] you eating my flesh because the flesh
[1:02:10] profiteth nothing it's the spirit that
[1:02:13] quickeneth the words that I speak unto
[1:02:14] you they are spirit and they are life
[1:02:17] but there are some of you that believe
[1:02:18] not for jesus knew from the beginning
[1:02:20] who were to believe him not and who
[1:02:21] should betray him and he said therefore
[1:02:23] sit on to you that no man can come unto
[1:02:26] me except that were given unto him of my
[1:02:29] father from that time many of his
[1:02:31] disciples went back to walk went back
[1:02:33] and walked no more with him why they
[1:02:38] could not take that they had to be so
[1:02:40] intimate with that man that's what he
[1:02:43] wanted he wanted somebody to be intimate
[1:02:45] when when you partake uh something that
[1:02:47] makes you you're close you're intimate
[1:02:49] with it when Jesus was saying he says
[1:02:51] okay I'm gonna come and I'm going to
[1:02:53] give you the Holy Ghost but you're gonna
[1:02:55] have to enter in so much for my flesh my
[1:02:58] flesh is going to be your flesh my blood
[1:03:01] is going to be your blood and you're
[1:03:03] going to live off of it and that's
[1:03:05] what's going to sustain you the
[1:03:07] revelation of this word
[1:03:09] feeding we're feeding why can a whiny
[1:03:12] brother branham walk up in one day and
[1:03:14] said we're feeding on this body word of
[1:03:16] the son of man what we're feeding on
[1:03:18] this revelation that no one else has had
[1:03:21] they didn't even have it that's why many
[1:03:25] disciples were walking away now
[1:03:29] brother Brown said when the bride says I
[1:03:32] and my father are one and these other
[1:03:36] things this shucks will pull away why
[1:03:39] because they can't stand it they can't
[1:03:41] take that rich of a revelation hey man
[1:03:45] there's a lot of things I like to eat
[1:03:46] that's really rich you can't eat a lot
[1:03:48] of it to make you sick same way with
[1:03:51] this word of God they some people can't
[1:03:52] take it that's why you see them leaving
[1:03:55] that's why you see some of them just
[1:03:56] going off and you know say I can't take
[1:04:00] that cuz look and you know the old
[1:04:02] saying watch the old saying that's John
[1:04:04] 6 anybody told you that that's John 6
[1:04:08] john 6:66 they walked away from 666 the
[1:04:14] number of man john 6:66 they walked no
[1:04:18] more with him why because they had a
[1:04:20] mark but that's just what people say so
[1:04:23] that's okay let's go to first
[1:04:25] Corinthians cuz I want you to see what
[1:04:26] now watch what are you done that was in
[1:04:29] John this is in Corinthians this has
[1:04:32] been revealed to Paul of the communion
[1:04:40] brother Dale we're going to do something
[1:04:42] about we're not going to be here the
[1:04:43] next Sunday for the communion either
[1:04:46] we're gonna be going so we'll have to do
[1:04:50] it in the middle of the month or what
[1:04:51] you whatever you decide but I just want
[1:04:53] to let you know we're not gonna be the
[1:04:54] two Sundays in a row or Ernie will be
[1:04:56] here and then the neck oh and next I
[1:04:58] knew we forgot forgot one we're going to
[1:05:01] the Duran's home that wasn't on my list
[1:05:04] of many things I had to say but next
[1:05:07] Sunday after the second service we need
[1:05:09] to get a GPS marker on their home and go
[1:05:11] have their house dedicated they're going
[1:05:14] to have shrimp pasta and rib eyes
[1:05:18] medium-rare baked potato so
[1:05:22] I'm just kidding just joking just
[1:05:25] kidding
[1:05:25] I just wanted to wake you out come over
[1:05:27] you're still asleep look Jesus so now
[1:05:30] watch what Jesus said now watch he comes
[1:05:33] and he has to look look at me a minute
[1:05:37] Matthew wrote down what he said by the
[1:05:40] Holy Ghost
[1:05:41] that wasn't just Matthew's writings that
[1:05:43] we read them in our John's I'm talking
[1:05:45] about John's writing that wasn't just
[1:05:46] John's writing John was in the upper
[1:05:49] room when this happened but he didn't
[1:05:51] have it he didn't have let me just play
[1:05:53] he didn't have the position to say what
[1:05:55] Paul did you know why because John heard
[1:05:59] Jesus say eat my flesh and drink my
[1:06:01] blood and I'm sure John had a little
[1:06:03] problem in his brain hey listen if a man
[1:06:08] you were following walks up and says you
[1:06:10] got to eat me and you got to drink my
[1:06:13] blood before you'll have any part women
[1:06:15] now you know your humanity would be like
[1:06:21] yeah but Paul didn't have a problem with
[1:06:24] it because Paul had already protect
[1:06:26] because watch and we had given thanks he
[1:06:29] brake it and said take eat now remember
[1:06:31] this is this is the Holy Ghost now
[1:06:33] running coming through Paul's filter
[1:06:36] coming through a prophet Paul a prophet
[1:06:40] Paul is now telling us and breaking it
[1:06:43] down of what to do take eat this is my
[1:06:46] body now what do you do he broke bread
[1:06:48] and said take eat this is my body which
[1:06:52] is broken for you that's doing
[1:06:54] remembrance of me and after the same
[1:06:57] manner also he took the cup and when he
[1:06:58] had supped saying this cup which was
[1:07:01] wine is the New Testament that's why I'm
[1:07:04] still telling you all today or yesterday
[1:07:06] we're talking about Matthew Mark Luke
[1:07:08] and John is not - we've said it many
[1:07:11] times before it's not they're still in
[1:07:13] the Old Testament the true New Testament
[1:07:18] is when that testator died shed his
[1:07:22] blood that blood came back on the day of
[1:07:24] Pentecost cleanse those believers and
[1:07:28] made them a new testament because look
[1:07:31] the Bible even tells you there must be
[1:07:33] the death of a testator for there to be
[1:07:34] a New Testament
[1:07:36] so Matthew Mark Luke and John is not in
[1:07:38] the New Testament it's the Old Testament
[1:07:40] Jesus was born under the law I'm quoting
[1:07:43] scripture Jesus was born under the law
[1:07:46] and even when he would go and heal
[1:07:49] somebody of a certain disease he said go
[1:07:51] to the law Moses because remember in
[1:07:53] Moses time if you were a leper if you
[1:07:56] were cleanse you had to go show him and
[1:07:58] present a sacrifice Jesus didn't say
[1:08:02] well bless God you don't have to go and
[1:08:03] do the law no more I'm here no he said
[1:08:06] you're healed
[1:08:07] told my to Leopard he said go do the law
[1:08:09] of Moses in other words what presents
[1:08:11] yourself to the priest go they were
[1:08:12] still under the law his blood hadn't
[1:08:14] been shed the testator while he was
[1:08:16] alive there's no new testament its sole
[1:08:20] testament but this is the cup is the New
[1:08:23] Testament in my blood this do ye as oft
[1:08:26] as you drink it in remembrance of me so
[1:08:29] you say well brother then all we gotta
[1:08:31] do is take communion and we're fine no
[1:08:34] you got to take communion every day pull
[1:08:37] the piece of that I need it pull the
[1:08:39] pita not literally I'm talking about the
[1:08:40] word we got to eat this word when
[1:08:43] brother Branham when those seals open to
[1:08:45] that prophet that was the son of man not
[1:08:49] in brewing in Branham that was the
[1:08:51] message that hey the son of man is here
[1:08:54] the Son of Man has been trying to get in
[1:08:57] that door back in the church because
[1:09:00] they kicked him out there all right and
[1:09:06] like Bob said there were seven seals on
[1:09:10] that door
[1:09:12] cuz I'm telling you it's got this talk
[1:09:15] to y'all today Jesus broke the seals but
[1:09:21] remember I told you you and I showed
[1:09:23] them back up we seal it back that's
[1:09:26] what's happened down through the church
[1:09:27] ages that's why all that eatin went on
[1:09:29] when the tree cuz what we put we put we
[1:09:31] put the seal back on hey man we did but
[1:09:36] you know who really opens the seal Jesus
[1:09:38] Christ opens the seal but you know he
[1:09:40] doesn't open it to a tree or a bench or
[1:09:44] a car
[1:09:45] it's your revelation is what opens that
[1:09:48] seal your revelation is what
[1:09:50] opens that seal so that way I know the
[1:09:53] son of man's here if that revelation has
[1:09:55] been open then the son of man has to be
[1:09:57] here not out in the airwaves in you and
[1:10:01] me in the word that come forth
[1:10:04] I hope we see that this is the New
[1:10:09] Testament and we have a mandate in this
[1:10:14] New Testament that the son of man is
[1:10:17] back again he's alive in this church
[1:10:20] again proving his word 1964 this is the
[1:10:28] one I was going to tell you right here
[1:10:32] all right pull it back up now for 1,900
[1:10:35] years with the church ages past and all
[1:10:37] the things that he profits out of Luthor
[1:10:39] Wesley we just went through and seen it
[1:10:41] draw it out and the moon came down moon
[1:10:43] came down and drawed it out and the Lord
[1:10:44] brought it out on the board here for us
[1:10:46] and showed it come down himself and
[1:10:48] confirmed it to be right after nineteen
[1:10:50] hundred years now what he's we're at the
[1:10:53] end of the Laodicean Church age now
[1:10:56] remember the Laodicean Church ages the
[1:10:58] shortest age there is little bitty short
[1:11:00] age compared to all the other ones he
[1:11:03] promised in Luke 17 xxx at this same son
[1:11:06] of man he promised it would be revealed
[1:11:08] in the days like it wasn't Sodom upon
[1:11:10] the earth did he do it does it have to
[1:11:13] come to pass it's impossible now
[1:11:14] remember he come in three names the son
[1:11:17] of man a prophet the son of God the
[1:11:19] spirit son of David for the Millennium
[1:11:21] but in between this conjunction now
[1:11:24] according to his own words in the days
[1:11:26] when the son of man shall be revealed
[1:11:29] revealed himself as what not son of God
[1:11:33] son of man will reveal his self in a
[1:11:36] different way now I'm telling you what
[1:11:39] he said a different way now not some of
[1:11:44] these strange doctrine but no it has to
[1:11:47] dovetail with the Word of God then
[1:11:50] alright it has to be the same he will
[1:11:55] reveal his now are you a recipient of
[1:11:59] that you have to answer that question
[1:12:02] because he worried
[1:12:04] who's gonna reveal herself to the trees
[1:12:05] the cars the no he's gonna reveal
[1:12:07] himself to somebody somebody's going to
[1:12:10] take it and say I believe that let's
[1:12:14] just sit under it and let's listen to it
[1:12:17] unless hear God speak to us in a way he
[1:12:20] never spoke to anybody else
[1:12:23] except when he was here his own self and
[1:12:25] they didn't believe who he was when he
[1:12:27] was here but you and I now have the Holy
[1:12:29] Ghost listen to me you and I have the
[1:12:31] Holy Ghost in our soul Peter James and
[1:12:34] John did not have the Holy Ghost in
[1:12:35] their soul before the day of Pentecost
[1:12:37] so they did not understand what he was
[1:12:39] talking about and they only stood
[1:12:41] understood parts of what he was talking
[1:12:43] about because when he left the headship
[1:12:46] went with him the headstone went with
[1:12:48] him that headstone revelation of the Son
[1:12:50] of Man went with come on he didn't come
[1:12:53] back on the day of Pentecost as the son
[1:12:55] of man he came back to Pentecost as the
[1:12:57] son of God the Son of Man revelation was
[1:13:00] left somewhere it was sealed up with
[1:13:02] seven seals that all rights a man or he
[1:13:06] can say owe me for those y'all there
[1:13:07] sleep you want to get you a rubber band
[1:13:14] or something and just keep doing this
[1:13:24] all right let's go to the next one see
[1:13:28] that's the point that's the pole part
[1:13:29] we're not getting we must realize this
[1:13:33] is now the honing time we're not
[1:13:36] shooting with a shotgun we've been
[1:13:38] shooting with a shotgun
[1:13:39] since the Apostles time Pentecost shot
[1:13:44] with a double-barrel shotgun whoever
[1:13:46] they hit the head no the honing time is
[1:13:49] what we're shooting at two to three at a
[1:13:53] hundred yards and we're hitting the
[1:13:55] bull's eye like this that's what I
[1:13:58] that's what we are because look the
[1:14:00] scatter was the shotgun pattern is list
[1:14:02] anywhere believe this believe that seven
[1:14:06] thunder versus all these different
[1:14:08] doctrines that's been in we got to hone
[1:14:10] it down to one point one thing the Son
[1:14:12] of Man meant message and ministry is
[1:14:16] here today somewhere you guys decide
[1:14:19] where it's at and you know what you may
[1:14:25] want to go somewhere where there's more
[1:14:26] emotion but if the words not being
[1:14:29] preached you can go to hell shouting and
[1:14:37] speaking in tongues but you can't go to
[1:14:39] hell with the Son of Man revelation in
[1:14:41] your heart you can't there's no way you
[1:14:44] can because God can't put herself back
[1:14:47] in Hell again he's already been in Hell
[1:14:50] one time God went to hell
[1:14:54] hey man you went with him so you ain't
[1:14:57] gotta go
[1:14:58] you don't been to hell you got a little
[1:15:00] more you don't have to go up one time
[1:15:03] now who is this who is the Son of Man in
[1:15:06] the beginning was the word the Word was
[1:15:08] with God in the word was gone and the
[1:15:10] Word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:15:13] and if all the teaching that we have in
[1:15:16] confirmation of the word of God by word
[1:15:17] of god by signs by wonders we see today
[1:15:20] that in the Book of Luke that we are
[1:15:22] just quoted now remember the signs and
[1:15:24] wonders and brother Bronze Age was what
[1:15:26] for what to catch the people's attention
[1:15:28] because we're fixing to get into the
[1:15:30] shout divorce and the arc and divorce of
[1:15:32] the Archangel and Trump of God all right
[1:15:34] well then that's what we're heading to
[1:15:35] because listen these street things has
[1:15:37] to happen before
[1:15:38] we see that come to pass all right so
[1:15:41] we'll go we'll read it we see today the
[1:15:44] Book of Luke here we just quoted of the
[1:15:46] Luke 1730 Malachi 4 in different
[1:15:48] scriptures were all acquainted with that
[1:15:50] that word again is waved over the people
[1:15:52] what word the word of the Son of Man was
[1:15:57] waved over the people that the Dead
[1:15:58] traditions of man is dead and the Son of
[1:16:01] God is alive again with the baptism of
[1:16:02] the Holy Ghost right among us and giving
[1:16:04] us life let's keep going now we'll go to
[1:16:06] Book of Revelations and who is now look
[1:16:11] let's go to the red part and then we'll
[1:16:13] skip through them we know that John
[1:16:16] looks John hears a voice and he turns to
[1:16:19] see a man he sees a man but this man has
[1:16:23] has become into a position that may be
[1:16:29] startled John a little bit because you
[1:16:32] heard a voice and turn around and look
[1:16:34] and saw one liking to the Son of Man
[1:16:36] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[1:16:37] and Girt about the paps with a golden
[1:16:39] girdle now I want y'all to realize you
[1:16:41] ever realized that through seven church
[1:16:44] ages it's been the bride feminist farm
[1:16:49] bride but they've never got that son of
[1:16:53] man revelation part what are you saying
[1:16:59] I'm telling you this message that we
[1:17:01] have a part of today is what's going to
[1:17:03] pull them under that son of man
[1:17:06] revelation and bring them out of the
[1:17:08] ground
[1:17:09] you said I can't do it no you're not
[1:17:12] gonna do it you're gonna let God do it
[1:17:15] but you know what you got to do you got
[1:17:17] to believe it you got to believe that
[1:17:20] that's your commission I'm telling you
[1:17:22] my Commission is a resurrection I have
[1:17:26] been elected to stand in this church age
[1:17:28] to bring a resurrection now whether you
[1:17:31] believe that or not
[1:17:32] I want somebody to believe it because if
[1:17:33] I fall down and have to go by the grave

[1:17:37] us out of the ground amen so this son of
[1:17:42] mass why I'm telling you this son of man
[1:17:44] Revelation is so important they never
[1:17:46] had a son of man revelation and back in
[1:17:48] in the seven church ages
[1:17:52] but we do and that's what's gonna bring
[1:17:55] them out that's what's gonna bring their
[1:17:58] bodies and change them right in front of
[1:18:00] us that all right number four seven
[1:18:05] Church ages this was in 1954 and in the
[1:18:08] midst of the seven golden counts today
[1:18:10] is one like the son of man what one like
[1:18:12] him who was this his bride one like him

[1:18:18] down to the foot the holiness of Jesus
[1:18:20] Christ covering her has washed us from
[1:18:22] our sins thank God with his own blood
[1:18:24] girded about the paps not a man a woman
[1:18:28] so this is all bride for me they're all
[1:18:32] right with that
[1:18:33] this is bride form John looks and he
[1:18:37] sees a man standing there Girt about the
[1:18:39] paps breasts in a feminist form but it's
[1:18:44] the son of man

[1:18:48] then you hear what did you said what
[1:18:53] liked him Oh Girt about the paps not a
[1:18:55] man a woman but remember their
[1:19:04] revelation was the son of God to the
[1:19:10] church ages believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:19:12] Christ and thou shalt be safe that's
[1:19:15] their Commission our Commission is to
[1:19:18] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:19:19] thou shalt be saved
[1:19:20] plus plus plus that plus the headstone
[1:19:29] coming back
[1:19:32] that's our Commission let's go to
[1:19:35] Revelation 3 now this is I'm not gonna
[1:19:38] read that go ahead and to the Angel the
[1:19:41] Church of the Laodiceans now these this
[1:19:43] is the age we're living in these things
[1:19:45] that say Amen the faithful and true
[1:19:46] witness the beginning of the creation of
[1:19:48] God there buddy understand that Jesus
[1:19:51] Christ was the way God wanted us created
[1:19:54] yourself created know that man created a
[1:20:04] car
[1:20:05] right we didn't create all the stuff
[1:20:10] that makes the car
[1:20:12] God created the stuff to make the car
[1:20:14] man just formed it put it together
[1:20:17] that's what this is it Jesus Christ was
[1:20:20] at the beginning as that beginning
[1:20:22] because we remember even brother Branham
[1:20:26] talks about this the faithful and true
[1:20:28] witness you think well Manny's false no
[1:20:31] that means it's got a true sound to it
[1:20:33] it's got a true you know this thing
[1:20:35] could be you can you can play a piano
[1:20:38] but it has a true sound to it when it's
[1:20:42] what when it's tuned it has a true sound
[1:20:44] to it that's not that he was false and
[1:20:46] now you become true no he's the witness
[1:20:49] he's the only one the beginning of the
[1:20:51] creation the God why he came the way we
[1:20:54] should have came I know thy works that
[1:20:57] thou art neither cold nor hot let's just
[1:20:58] keep going down to the bottom verse
[1:21:00] nineteen as me as I love and rebuke and
[1:21:02] chasten be zealous and repent we ended
[1:21:05] up with us a couple of Sundays ago
[1:21:06] behold I stand at the door knock see the
[1:21:09] man hear my voice the voice of whom not
[1:21:12] the voice of the Son of God the voice of
[1:21:14] the Son of Man because that man is
[1:21:16] standing at the door and he's knocking
[1:21:19] and you've got to open the door brother
[1:21:25] Branham gave us the seals 50 something
[1:21:27] years ago you've got to open them I
[1:21:31] don't think you believe that you think
[1:21:35] that just because brother Branham opened
[1:21:36] them they're open well why didn't we
[1:21:39] take a rapture when we took the body
[1:21:41] James White was have a resurrection why
[1:21:43] we still dying cuz the Son of man can't
[1:21:46] die not anymore

[1:21:55] church a I will come into him and with
[1:21:58] what bring fellowship back that's our
[1:22:01] problem
[1:22:02] the seals remember I told you many many
[1:22:04] times the seals is not for the
[1:22:06] redemption of your soul there's many
[1:22:10] people going to be in heaven they never
[1:22:12] heard of seven seals and God birthed him
[1:22:15] into the body change their soul by the
[1:22:18] Son of God
[1:22:19] halation but you and i are not in that
[1:22:21] age your and I are in the age to where
[1:22:23] we want full fellowship God wants full
[1:22:26] fellowship back with us and then that's
[1:22:29] what the sales do the sales does the
[1:22:31] sales bring back to me full fellowship
[1:22:36] eat my flesh and drink my blood how
[1:22:40] intimate is that that's a pretty
[1:22:43] intimate amen now look at the Feast of

[1:23:51] manifested in a man named Hitler and all
[1:23:53] them that took him kill physically

[1:25:17] physically out of the grave Jesus died
[1:25:20] and rose again even so them also which
[1:25:22] sleep in Jesus will God bring with him
[1:25:25] for this we say unto you by the word of
[1:25:28] the Lord in other words this is exactly
[1:25:30] the way it's going to happen it comes by
[1:25:32] the word of the Lord for this we say
[1:25:35] unto you by the word of the Lord that we
[1:25:36] which are alive and remain can we say we
[1:25:39] we which are alive and remain unto the
[1:25:42] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[1:25:43] them which are asleep
[1:25:45] in other words there's going to be some
[1:25:49] unbelief still here we which are alive
[1:25:56] and remain unto the coming of Lord shall
[1:25:58] not prevent them which are asleep
[1:26:03] because we're listen we're not going to
[1:26:05] resurrect them the words gonna resurrect
[1:26:07] them alright for the Lord himself shall
[1:26:11] descend from heaven with a shout with
[1:26:14] the voice of the Archangel and with the
[1:26:17] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[1:26:20] shall rise first
[1:26:23] alright the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:26:25] first give me about ten minutes and you
[1:26:28] can fall back to sleep again
[1:26:33] the Lord Himself now look the Lord
[1:26:36] Himself
[1:26:37] he's coming himself
[1:26:40] but the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:26:42] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[1:26:44] the Archangel with the Trump of God now
[1:26:46] listen folks put this on your
[1:26:51] refrigerator too because this is only
[1:26:52] talking to you there's no one in this
[1:26:57] world that that's talking to you I'm
[1:27:00] telling you that's what I'm saying when
[1:27:02] I started reading all this I'm like man
[1:27:04] this is so pinpoint and precise you can
[1:27:06] take that right there and you can put it
[1:27:08] right here and say that's talking to no
[1:27:11] one on the earth except me yeah thank
[1:27:15] you you got a real eye just talking to
[1:27:17] you and listen those that are going on
[1:27:21] not talking to them those that are in
[1:27:23] different denominations that's not to
[1:27:25] them this is to me and you that's why
[1:27:31] this son of man messages to me it's so
[1:27:33] clear that's it right there that's it
[1:27:36] for the Lord Himself showed you say he
[1:27:39] came under that Pentecost read it in the
[1:27:42] revelation of the Son of God not to
[1:27:45] revelation this on a man right this is
[1:27:48] the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:27:50] heaven with a shout the voice of the
[1:27:53] Archangel with the Trump of God and the
[1:27:55] dead in Christ shall rise first now
[1:27:58] listen here's my take on that if you're
[1:28:02] not dead in Christ now you're not going
[1:28:04] to rise first you can't be dead in
[1:28:08] Christ in the grave you got to die now
[1:28:13] so the ones that died in Christ here
[1:28:17] shall rise first that's the way I look
[1:28:21] at it there's nobody in the grave that's
[1:28:24] dead in Christ how can you put them two
[1:28:26] together but you can be here today and
[1:28:29] be dead in Christ those there had to be
[1:28:32] a death we haven't been through that
[1:28:33] there had to be a death under the third
[1:28:36] seal there had to be a death for you to
[1:28:38] get the new birth the old you had to die
[1:28:41] so we just go asleep we just sleep the
[1:28:47] people that are in the grave now they're
[1:28:49] just resting they're sleeping they're
[1:28:51] waiting and that's not so bad
[1:28:55] that's not a glisten no pain no agony no
[1:29:02] taxes coming up on April the 15th I mean
[1:29:06] really the things that we have to deal
[1:29:07] with God has put them away and said you
[1:29:10] don't have to deal with that anymore
[1:29:13] I've commissioned these people I've
[1:29:18] commissioned these people to get you out
[1:29:21] of the grave what do you think they're
[1:29:23] standing always ain't brother reaching
[1:29:24] in we're standing over on the side just
[1:29:26] going well today he's been alone no no
[1:29:32] no him and Gary Adkins and though we're
[1:29:35] gigs like this and Richards got his
[1:29:38] cuffs on and they're going man this is
[1:29:44] good
[1:29:46] Gary Atkins is like man I run it I run
[1:29:48] it couldn't run started come on people
[1:29:52] it's not as bad as we think it is and
[1:29:59] you know what they're done they're
[1:30:02] finished they're there all their way all
[1:30:07] they're waiting on is for me and you
[1:30:11] then we which are alive and remain
[1:30:14] because listen this is the great mystery
[1:30:17] that I have a problem with I still do
[1:30:19] I'm sorry I have a problem with we're
[1:30:21] gonna get them out of a grave they're
[1:30:23] gonna go glorified body and we're gonna
[1:30:25] have to wait around for a little while
[1:30:27] before we get our glorified body for we
[1:30:29] which are alive and remain shall be
[1:30:32] caught up together because the dead in
[1:30:33] Christ will rise first but you know that
[1:30:38] proves to me one thing it's not your
[1:30:41] body that's going to do it it's that
[1:30:43] spirit that dwells inside of you is
[1:30:45] going to do it but it's got to come from
[1:30:49] the voice of the Resurrection then we
[1:30:52] which are alive and remain shall be
[1:30:54] caught up together with them in the
[1:30:56] clouds to meet the lord in the air and
[1:30:57] so shall we ever be with the Lord but
[1:31:03] you know what we had a prophet come and
[1:31:05] fill in
[1:31:06] yeah cuz we're not going we're going to
[1:31:12] meet the Lord in the air
[1:31:13] alright let's take a little gap right
[1:31:15] here we got a marriage supper we got to
[1:31:19] come back into millennium we got to have
[1:31:22] a white throne judgment for the others
[1:31:24] not for us and then we walk into a
[1:31:26] future home when this comes up but we
[1:31:31] had a prophet to tell us what's inside
[1:31:32] of all that we had a prophet that's why
[1:31:35] I mean why do we worry why do we worry
[1:31:40] about things because we don't understand
[1:31:43] them
[1:31:44] right I am NOT an electrician I am not
[1:31:47] gonna walk over there and open that
[1:31:48] panel up and start fooling with stuff
[1:31:50] why I'm scared but you know what if
[1:31:54] you're in a master electrician that's no
[1:31:55] more to you than us you know putting a
[1:31:57] pencil in your pocket right why because
[1:31:59] you are trained you know what's going on
[1:32:01] you know what's happening you know what
[1:32:03] electricity they'll do to you you know
[1:32:04] what to wires not to put together which
[1:32:06] I wouldn't write that's what this is
[1:32:10] this is your training part to teach you
[1:32:13] how to handle not just your everyday
[1:32:17] life people people handle their everyday
[1:32:19] life since everyday life we're coming by
[1:32:22] handling the Word of God we're talking
[1:32:25] about handling the Son of man eating the
[1:32:26] flesh drinking the blood being intimate
[1:32:29] with the Son of Man wherefore comfort
[1:32:31] one another with these words that all
[1:32:34] right so now let's let them let brother
[1:32:36] branham explain this just for a few
[1:32:37] minutes in the rapture message now watch
[1:32:39] this people do they even when I go
[1:32:42] places to preach I tell them I said I am
[1:32:44] NOT looking for a rapture I am NOT
[1:32:49] raptures not even the Bible I'm not
[1:32:53] saying it's not going to happen what's
[1:32:55] what brother Brown said the word rapture
[1:32:57] in the Bible is not even used at all hmm
[1:33:02] we just put that word there hmm
[1:33:07] the Bible says caught up being caught up
[1:33:12] because what is rapture rapture is not
[1:33:16] look
[1:33:18] and don't get me wrong we say the
[1:33:21] rapture has been in process since the
[1:33:23] day of Pentecost and it has but the
[1:33:26] rapture is a one-time event one time
[1:33:31] we're going to be caught it we don't
[1:33:33] have four we don't have four or five
[1:33:34] raptures there's been raptures you and I
[1:33:36] to have one rapture one catching up so
[1:33:40] it's in the event it said what commit is
[1:33:43] you know what to me is it's the trophy
[1:33:45] at the end of the game you got to play
[1:33:48] the game you got to play it good and you
[1:33:50] got to win but when you win you get a
[1:33:52] trophy the trophy is God's gonna catch
[1:33:55] us out of this place amen let's read the
[1:34:00] brush listen the prophet so listen I'm
[1:34:02] not belittling the word rapture because
[1:34:04] brother Brown preached the rapture but
[1:34:06] he said the word raptures not even in
[1:34:08] the Bible listen the word rapture is
[1:34:11] ecstasy ar-ar-ar there's other words for
[1:34:14] it that I'm gonna mention but rapture is
[1:34:17] an ecstasy what is it it's it's what
[1:34:19] happens after something happens after
[1:34:22] something happens it's an ecstasy or a
[1:34:25] time that that's why I said we're gonna
[1:34:26] be boom we're gonna be caught up alright
[1:34:30] but I like to say we're gonna take a
[1:34:34] body change first well I mean we're
[1:34:37] gonna have a resurrection first we're
[1:34:38] gonna take a body change next and then
[1:34:40] we're gonna be caught up that's right
[1:34:42] that's what we're saying here we read
[1:34:43] here in 2nd Thessalonians 4 first
[1:34:45] Thessalonians this order of this great
[1:34:46] rapture that will take place in the last
[1:34:48] days listen to this here we're going to
[1:34:51] begin here with the 13th verse I
[1:34:52] wouldn't have you ignorant brethren
[1:34:54] concerning those which are asleep that
[1:34:55] you sorrow not even as others have no
[1:34:57] hope well we believe Christ died and
[1:34:59] rose again even so then which sleep in
[1:35:01] Jesus will God bring with him for we
[1:35:04] saying to you by the word of the Lord
[1:35:05] that we which are alive and remain unto
[1:35:07] the coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[1:35:08] that word prevent means hinder those
[1:35:11] that are asleep for the Lord himself
[1:35:12] shall descend now listen close the Lord
[1:35:15] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:35:17] shout the voice of Archangel the Trump
[1:35:19] of God and the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:35:20] first now I want you to notice a great
[1:35:23] thing taking place here don't miss it
[1:35:25] the word says here in 2nd Thessalonians
[1:35:27] he meant that there is three things from
[1:35:31] the 13th to the 6
[1:35:32] theme verse there is three things that
[1:35:34] has to happen before the Lord himself
[1:35:37] appears quickly now so we can close same
[1:35:40] here
[1:35:40] the first thing happened I notice a
[1:35:42] shout a voice of trumpet let's read it
[1:35:44] again see it's right for the Lord
[1:35:45] Himself sixteenth first shall descend
[1:35:47] from heaven with a shout forced to the
[1:35:49] archangel and the trumpet of God three
[1:35:51] things happen a voice a shout the voice
[1:35:54] of trumpet how does that happen before
[1:35:56] Jesus appears now a shout Jesus does all
[1:35:59] three of them when he's he's descending
[1:36:02] the Lord for himself shall descend see
[1:36:05] that now here's the problem that the
[1:36:08] world has they're waiting on that to
[1:36:10] happen they're waiting on that to happen
[1:36:15] I a good friend of mine Baptists please
[1:36:18] come a little bit Pentecostal he said
[1:36:20] I'll be glad when I can see the cloud
[1:36:24] there I mean literally he's you can see
[1:36:26] it he's wanting the clouds to open and
[1:36:28] Jesus to walk down through the clouds
[1:36:31] till that's what he said you see the Son
[1:36:33] of man coming in the clouds of glory and
[1:36:35] I just told you my city before thinking
[1:36:37] I said if you see that you've missed
[1:36:38] rapture because that's not that's not a
[1:36:42] secret this thing we're talking about is
[1:36:45] a secret we're gonna be gone from here
[1:36:47] nobody hardly even know it alright you

[1:36:53] brother Brian's message is available to
[1:36:56] the whole world and how many people
[1:36:59] listen to it one tenth of one tenth of
[1:37:02] one percent but it's available to the
[1:37:04] whole world
[1:37:05] but who's gonna listen a voice of shout
[1:37:08] Jesus appears now Jesus does all three
[1:37:10] of them when he's descending now what is
[1:37:14] a shout it's the message going forth the
[1:37:19] Living bread of life bringing forth the
[1:37:21] bride now what does a shout do hey
[1:37:30] yeah weights y'all thank you literally
[1:37:34] but what is a shell when somebody shouts
[1:37:37] you know if you see a great group of
[1:37:39] people and if one person shouts what do
[1:37:41] you do it gets your attention basically
[1:37:46] when they shout real out it gets your
[1:37:48] attention this message is what got our
[1:37:51] attention so that God could speak to us
[1:37:55] cuz listen the letter killeth you can
[1:37:59] read every quote you want to and it will
[1:38:01] kill you and send you down but if you
[1:38:03] ever hear the voice behind that now look
[1:38:07] now prophets no one to read don't you
[1:38:10] see this there is such a thing as gift
[1:38:12] of prophecy in the church but a prophet
[1:38:15] is predestinated and for Dane for the
[1:38:17] hour now watch him slide what he's doing
[1:38:20] is he's sliding his position right in
[1:38:21] and telling them where he's at and he's
[1:38:24] telling us yes sir now if a prophecy
[1:38:26] goes forth two or three has to set and
[1:38:29] judge whether it's right or not for the
[1:38:32] church can receive it but nobody set
[1:38:35] before a prophet in other words I'm
[1:38:39] telling you the brother Dale has always
[1:38:40] said if you can correct brother Branham
[1:38:41] then you have injected yourself between
[1:38:44] God and him so that makes you the
[1:38:46] Prophet because there's nobody stands
[1:38:48] between a prophet except God that's what
[1:38:51] he tells you right here but nobody set
[1:38:53] before a prophet in other words brother
[1:38:55] rom didn't have to prophesy we'll get
[1:38:57] into that later prophesy and two or
[1:39:00] three people had to judge what he's
[1:39:02] saying no he's a prophet what he says is
[1:39:05] the truth and it comes from God but
[1:39:07] nobody said before prophet goes he was
[1:39:09] absolutely the Word of God he was that
[1:39:15] word in his day you seen God reflects
[1:39:18] now God has promised to send us that
[1:39:21] again in the last days to bring the
[1:39:23] bride out of that ecclesiastical mess in
[1:39:26] the only way it can be done
[1:39:30] it'll never it'll never be done the
[1:39:34] church can't receive Christ we the
[1:39:36] Pentecostals you saw about that age we
[1:39:39] can't carry this message on in the
[1:39:41] condition that the church is in today
[1:39:44] in other words you know what brother
[1:39:45] Brown was doing he's telling them I am
[1:39:47] preaching to you what's going to change
[1:39:50] you but you're not listening you're
[1:39:53] shouting you're wanting the healings
[1:39:54] you're speaking in tongues you do you're
[1:39:56] not getting the message the first thing
[1:40:00] comes when he starts descending from
[1:40:02] heaven there's a shout what is it it's a
[1:40:04] message to get the people together
[1:40:07] what's it done look at us we're all we
[1:40:10] came from we didn't know each other most
[1:40:12] of us didn't know each other before we
[1:40:13] came into message wow this is bringing
[1:40:14] us together all right it's a message to
[1:40:18] get the people together a message come
[1:40:21] forth first now lamp trimming time
[1:40:23] rising trim your lamps what watch was
[1:40:26] that the seventh not the sixth read your
[1:40:32] Bible will be ten virgins all right now
[1:40:35] it's the first thing is the sounding and
[1:40:38] what's he telling us though he's telling
[1:40:40] us what age is coming in not the six to
[1:40:42] seven now it's the first thing is the
[1:40:44] sounding first thing is the trumpet
[1:40:47] neigh gets a little bit confused here
[1:40:49] but that's what he brings it back the
[1:40:50] first thing is the trumpet and or a
[1:40:52] voice a shout and then a voice and then
[1:40:54] a trumpet shout a messenger getting the
[1:40:59] people ready
[1:41:00] the second is the voice of the
[1:41:03] resurrection now you can say the message
[1:41:09] to get the people ready could be the
[1:41:13] years of preparation or you could say
[1:41:18] it's the fullness because the second is
[1:41:21] the voice of the resurrection listen the
[1:41:23] voice of the resurrection is when you
[1:41:25] open the door and let Christ then that's
[1:41:27] the Son of Man the Son of Man is the
[1:41:29] resurrection son the voice of the
[1:41:31] resurrection the same voice was 'watch
[1:41:33] the loud voice in Saint John 11:30 844
[1:41:36] that called Lazarus from the grave
[1:41:38] getting the bride together then the
[1:41:40] resurrection of the Dead to be caught up
[1:41:43] with it now watch the three things take
[1:41:45] place the next is water trumpet of voice
[1:41:48] he he gets a little mixed up here be
[1:41:51] careful where they call this a shout the
[1:41:52] voice in the trumpet that okay everybody
[1:41:54] say shout voice
[1:41:56] trumpet shout boys trumpet that's the
[1:41:59] way it happens shout to get the people
[1:42:00] together the voice of the Resurrection
[1:42:03] what what did he sweat was the voice of
[1:42:05] the resurrection
[1:42:06] the first thing he said was I am the
[1:42:08] resurrection that's what you got to
[1:42:10] believe oh we believe Jesus was the
[1:42:13] resurrection really do you still dying
[1:42:18] if you believe he was resurrection he
[1:42:20] said believe without this you'll never
[1:42:21] die
[1:42:22] mellow getting the bride together and in
[1:42:26] the resurrection of the dead sea to be
[1:42:28] caught up with it now watch the three
[1:42:29] things take place the next with the
[1:42:30] trumpet avoid a shout out of the voice
[1:42:32] of trumpet now the third thing is the
[1:42:34] trumpet which always at the feast of the
[1:42:36] trumpet is calling the people to the
[1:42:40] feast and it'll be the bride's supper
[1:42:45] because remember watch the seventh
[1:42:48] trumpet - Israel is the same as the
[1:42:50] seventh seal - you know there buddy got
[1:42:52] that same am the kingdoms of our Lord
[1:42:55] has become the kings of live is Christ
[1:42:56] now that's over in their age if you're
[1:42:58] talking about the trumpets because we're
[1:43:00] not here when a trumpet sign but the
[1:43:02] seven seals got to open here that the
[1:43:04] kingdoms of what right here this kingdom
[1:43:07] - he's talking about now the third thing
[1:43:10] is a trumpet which always at the feast
[1:43:12] of the trumpet is calling the people to
[1:43:14] a feast that'll be the bride's supper
[1:43:17] the Lambs supper with the bride in the
[1:43:18] sky the first thing comes forth is his
[1:43:21] message calling the bride together the
[1:43:23] next thing is the resurrection of the
[1:43:25] sleeping bride the one's died back in
[1:43:27] the other ages they're caught together
[1:43:29] and the trumpet the feast of the heavens
[1:43:31] in the sky why that's the thing that
[1:43:33] takes place friends so the message does
[1:43:41] what get your attention something you
[1:43:45] never heard before
[1:43:46] get your attention then the voice of the
[1:43:48] resurrection has to come from that same
[1:43:50] shout can't be shout different than
[1:43:54] voice shout the voice and resurrects all
[1:43:58] the same thing it's got to be the same
[1:43:59] what our problem is is we haven't had it
[1:44:02] in continuity before now we have it in
[1:44:04] continuity where the shout the voice
[1:44:09] and hold that together right there okay
[1:44:12] then all right
[1:44:14] that trumpet we're hearing the trumpet
[1:44:18] because the trumpets what he just said
[1:44:21] it brings you together too but what's he
[1:44:22] bringing us together to to go to the
[1:44:24] marriage supper but it also brings
[1:44:26] Israel together to take them to earth
[1:44:27] they get them as alright with that so
[1:44:30] you and I have a commission first
[1:44:36] thessalonians i want you to say this
[1:44:39] with me
[1:44:40] you ready say it with me class 1st

[1:45:02] because that's it
[1:45:05] the voice of the Resurrection has to
[1:45:07] come through I love human beings I want
[1:45:14] to tell you what the angel said one day

[1:48:15] so glad
[1:48:17] that I can say I'm one of them
[1:48:20] oh they were gathered in the upper room
[1:48:24] all praying in history times with the
[1:48:28] whole let God II started but you and I
[1:48:31] are gonna be later strike
[1:48:39] understood everything but I knew that
[1:48:41] God had changed something in their life
[1:48:43] and that's what happened on the day of
[1:48:46] our pinnacle come out and walk into our

[1:49:17] within my height you like the organs
[1:49:21] [Music]
[1:49:23] and don't play myself there had to help
[1:49:25] it oh I'm one of the
[1:49:30] I can say I'm one of them say I'm one of
[1:49:46] these you know sometimes when you read
[1:49:50] the Bible and you read it three or four
[1:49:51] times and you think well that didn't say
[1:49:53] that the first time I read it that's God
[1:49:56] speaking to you
[1:49:59] he's illuminating a part of the
[1:50:02] scripture that you may have read 25
[1:50:04] times or 30 times or 100 times but then
[1:50:07] now see it become time where you could
[1:50:09] take it you got to look at it that way
[1:50:12] you say the Lord why he can't listen
[1:50:14] he ain't gonna dump all this on us at
[1:50:16] one time we can't take it but if he it's
[1:50:22] like it's like the old saying about how
[1:50:23] do you cook a frog you don't throw him
[1:50:26] in the boiling water you put him in some
[1:50:28] warm water and let him sit back cross
[1:50:30] his legs but you keep turning the
[1:50:31] temperature up finally you got to cook
[1:50:34] frog he just don't know it well that's
[1:50:37] the same way with the devil he's a
[1:50:39] cooked frog he just don't know it yet
[1:50:42] and he's gonna try his best and that's
[1:50:45] his job and he's good at it so now you
[1:50:49] can say the devil of the Frog but he's
[1:50:52] not gonna prevent or hinder us getting
[1:50:56] our job done our job our mandate is to
[1:51:02] get those dead people out of the ground
[1:51:03] and the only reason that they come out
[1:51:07] of the ground is because death has been
[1:51:08] destroyed in somebody's life and you say
[1:51:12] well I hope it's me hope
[1:51:14] I hope it's me Jesus didn't walk up the
[1:51:20] ladders to say I may be the resurrection
[1:51:22] in life no I like those two words
[1:51:26] they're real short but they're very
[1:51:28] powerful I am before Abraham was I am
[1:51:34] Moses I am that I am I'm that one that's
[1:51:39] gonna carry you through they're all
[1:51:41] waiting on those folks
[1:51:43] sure we've had resurrections temporary
[1:51:45] ones but they're all going back again
[1:51:46] this one won't be man there'll be such a
[1:51:49] vacuum that'll pull them out listen it's
[1:51:51] gonna pull Paul out of the ground
[1:51:53] Peter James John all them will come out
[1:51:56] of the ground we're not just going with
[1:51:58] our group but I like what the scripture
[1:52:01] says those that are last will be first
[1:52:02] and those are the first to be last so
[1:52:05] you and I are gonna be the first ones
[1:52:07] we're going to see our group first I
[1:52:09] believe because the revelation is there
[1:52:14] and the revelation needs to be here that
[1:52:19] you and I are recipients of first
[1:52:24] Thessalonians that's the only group of
[1:52:26] people that's talking to it's talking to
[1:52:28] you it's talking to me so you know what
[1:52:32] it's not gonna make itself manifest then
[1:52:35] words has got to come off the paper and
[1:52:36] be alive in our life it's got to come
[1:52:40] off the paper because you know what
[1:52:41] people's read 1st Thessalonians since
[1:52:43] probably the 1500s when they put the
[1:52:45] Bible together we what you're alive and
[1:52:47] remain to the coming of the Lord shall
[1:52:48] not prevent or hinder those were asleep
[1:52:50] but the trumpet of God so son nobody
[1:52:52] heard a shout nobody heard the voice you
[1:52:56] and I've heard a shout you and I've got
[1:52:59] the voice and the trumpet will sound in
[1:53:03] a group of people let's bow our heads
[1:53:05] their heavenly Father thank you for this
[1:53:06] day we prayed to what we said have been
[1:53:09] pleasing to You Father we pray Lord that
[1:53:11] we'll take these things and pondered
[1:53:13] them in our heart Lord and let them
[1:53:15] become part of us truly we are the
[1:53:19] chosen we are the elect the
[1:53:22] predestinated the foreknown of God to
[1:53:24] stand in this day in this place and Lord
[1:53:29] be a part of you father we pray that
[1:53:32] you'd be with us now as we go our
[1:53:34] separate ways
[1:53:35] be with us on the highways keep us all
[1:53:37] safe or there's many ones that are sick
[1:53:40] among us lord I pray that you as your
[1:53:43] word went forth today that it would just
[1:53:45] heal them Lord and give them truly a
[1:53:47] temporary resurrection because we do we
[1:53:49] do like the temporary resurrections not
[1:53:51] doing away with m'lord but we're we're
[1:53:55] working for the time
[1:53:58] that the dead Saints will come among us
[1:54:00] and that'll be a reality Lord knows we
[1:54:03] were thinking the other day about even
[1:54:05] going into the future home and things it
[1:54:07] just sometimes it's it seems like a
[1:54:09] story to us we've been told these
[1:54:12] stories for years but Lord those stories
[1:54:16] you've got to come to pass those stories
[1:54:18] have got to be not stories anymore
[1:54:20] they've got to be lived by a group of
[1:54:22] people and I believe that we are living
[1:54:24] the vision but that vision has become
[1:54:27] reality now and we're standing in human
[1:54:29] flesh just where you wanted us this is
[1:54:31] where you wanted it to be this is the
[1:54:33] time you wanted it to be this is the
[1:54:35] place you wanted it to be and lord I
[1:54:38] pray that we would step up to that hour
[1:54:40] as we say step up to the plate and do
[1:54:44] our job do the things we're supposed to
[1:54:47] do Lord forgive us of our many mistakes
[1:54:49] and and being dilatory and not praying
[1:54:52] is what like we should or studying like
[1:54:54] we should Lord just help us to do better
[1:54:58] and that will all come back together and
[1:55:02] you Lord on Wednesday night prayer and
[1:55:04] preaching Lord give him the words of
[1:55:05] eternal life for us Lord I believe their
[1:55:07] eternal life words I believe that
[1:55:09] they're taking us right into eternity
[1:55:11] father Lord would prejudice you just be
[1:55:14] with each one take care of us on the
[1:55:15] highways again Lord keep us safe until
[1:55:18] we come back together in you in Jesus
[1:55:19] name we pray amen you're dismissed
[1:55:38] you
