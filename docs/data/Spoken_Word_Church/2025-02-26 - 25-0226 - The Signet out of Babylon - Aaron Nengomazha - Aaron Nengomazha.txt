amen God bless you Saints uh we can open Bibles our Bibles where we have you standing Hagi chapter 2:23 thank you so much musicians um certainly happy to be back in the house of the Lord with you happy to have uh uh our precious brother Samuel Wade I don't want to say junior I say the second so uh if you have it you can say Amen am all right I'm going to allow allow okay are we good all right hater 2:23 the Bible says in that day says the Lord of host in that day says the Lord of hosts will I take thee Oh zerubabel my servant the son of sh sh shtiel says the Lord and will make thee as a signate for I have chosen in the amen says the Lord of host amen amen so our title tonight is the signate out of babyon you may have your seats let me start my clock all because I said it for like three hours so the the early the early I start the better it is I'm not going to mention names but God bless you all really appreciate you I really appreciate all the brothers and the ministers that come out of this church amen I I was back there back there I was calling him the beer he backs all these good ministers from his hands so um I said bring you greetings from my pastor brother Barry coffee uh he says I should greet the church and my family I came with my wife today but she had a headache and you know with two kids long drive so I had she had to stay at the hotel but she really wanted to be here tonight so she I believe she's streaming and send you greetings so we we just go straight to the word of God so from the scripture that we read the Bible here is the prophet Hagi and I like these uh minor they call them Minor Prophets but that's just it's something that you know the scholars use in in order to distinguish between the 12 uh small books and the other large ones like Ezekiel but you don't find anything in the Bible that says major prophet or minor Prophet that is just for our reference just so that you know it's easy to explain but before God a prophet is a prophet in Israel you know they say Zechariah was a prophet Hagi was a prophet they don't like to the Jewish rabis they don't like to say minor and major but we just use it and it's it's fine you know but it's it's so so so these most of these Minor Prophets they prophesied during the time of the rebuilding of the of Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the temple amen and one of the scriptures says all Israel believe God trust in him and you shall be established believe His prophets and you shall prosper in other words God was saying for the work that you need to do of rebuilding the temple you need to trust God and you need to believe his prophets in other words they were not they were not going to be able to do the work of rebuilding without the blessing of the prophets without the supervision of the prophets because it was the prophets because the prophets are the eyes praise the Lord am the last time we were here remember we were talking about it was the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes so today it's kind of like in a similar inspiration has been you know laid upon my heart to study a little bit on zerubba Bell and and the real building and now now this character of zerubabel who is zerubabel now zerubabel means zerubabel which means one that is born out of Babylon praise the name of the Lord so zerubabel is born out of Babylon because remember when they went into Babylon because they disobeyed the word of the Lord they went into Babylon and some of them they got these Babylonian names and you know and and it took the Holy Ghost to to help them I remember who they were they had lost some of them were losing their identity you know they thought they were Babylonian some of them they thought they were they were just Americans or Africans they forgot that they were sons of of God they forgot that they were God's elect and many times the devil does that you know the first thing when when he took the that the wise children from from Judah he changed their names and he said You shall be called Baza you shall be called Shadrach mishek and abedo but those were not their names it was the devil who was trying to erase their identity because that's what the devil does you know he will take your eyes like Samson because you know remember Samson you know they took out his eyes when they took the eyes of Samson he began to entertain them so whenever a prophet is removed whenever a people they lose you know a prophet sometimes you know religion becomes entertainment they lose their identity so but Daniel he made sure that he does not lose his identity because he was reading the words of Jeremiah the prophet Hallelujah because it's very easy to be comfortable in Babylon yes so zerubabel was born out of Babylon because he was a symbol of a prophet that comes out of a gentile out of the Gentiles how many knows that amen because we have the Bible is written it's a prophetic book amen it's not you know a literal book that you read like a novel that's right like Daniel David could be going up the mountains and he would say my Lord my Lord why has Thou forsaken me it was David saying those words but it was a prophecy of Christ that was going to come amen hallelujah and David you know you would say things in the Psalms but then those things were prophesying of things that were going to come so you look at these characters in The Bible you know they were playing a drama because it's a God's you know it's it's it's a it's a it's a it's a story of redemption amen you know so so when we read these characters remember the scriptures they repeat themselves the scriptures have compound meaning so zerubabel was from the tribe of Judah and zerubabel they call him a prince because he was born from the tribe of Judah and really he could have been you know the best the next person to be in line to be the king and if you read the Gen the genealogy of Jesus Christ you'll find that in the Book of Luke it traces Christ through Mary through Nathan the son of David right and in the Book of Matthew it it traces Christ through Joseph the father through the through through Solomon the son of David is that correct so these are different by but they merge at zerubabel amen so zerubabel is a very interesting character because there were different people that were sent to re to rebuild Jerusalem and the temple I believe we spoke about that there was Ezra who went with with with a group there was Nehemiah that went with another group and then there was there was zerubabel who went with Joshua the high priest and Joshua how many remembers the story he has his clothes were filthy and he was not even qualified and the devil was there to accuse him and God says I have cleansed him he's a branch that is snatched from the fire Hallelujah so zerubabel then he goes and and God is saying here through hagay the prophet he says I'm going to take you zerubabel my servant but though you are my servant I'm going to make you as a Signet now what is a Signet a Signet is a ring how many knows that when the president of the United States President Donald Trump is speaking or he's writing letters or he's you know issuing you know his uh proclamations or is they call them executive orders he has to write them with the Seal of the United States so what what he says then it's no longer him saying it but it's we say it's the United States saying this we say Washington is saying this because that letter is the Seal of the United States back then you know the Kings and the Nobles they would they would seal documents with a with a with a with with a seal with with a signature with a stamp but then for East they would put it into a ring that will show you the ring and then they would put hot waxs and then they would what they would put the stamp and then that becomes the seal amen so each family has its seal each tribe has it's it's seal amen and I would be interested to see the Wade seal you know hallelujah praise the Lord so so zerubabel God is saying so now a seal then becomes a symbol of authority a seal a seal or a signate becomes a symbol of ownership that's what the prophet says the prophet says a seal is a symbol of ownership if you break the seal you you you have that that becomes something that becomes yours Hallelujah so the the seal becomes the symbol of of or finality when God is saying I have sent this man this is what I want he is saying I am making him my signant am hallelujah amen because he is a servant but he's also a signant now that's a very delicate balance to understand because some people may think he's God he's not God but some people may think he's just like any other person no he's not he's a servant but he's a signant amen hallelujah amen it's like God saying you know there was a man sent from God his name was John amen he was a man but he was sent from God so you got to have the balance if you lean on one side you've got a problem if you lean On The Other Extreme you've got a problem Hallelujah so if you lean on one side and you say oh the brother Bram is a is is God you're wrong come on brother if you lean on this other extreme and you say it's just like any other gift in the fivefold ministry that's also wrong because a prophet is called above the other ministers because the word of the Lord comes to a prophet Hallelujah can you say amen amen so we have three Babylons in the Bible so this zerubabel now before we get to you know this zerubabel is a type of the end time Prophet now the prophet tells us this in the message called the message of Grace right because zerubabel was a builder M Ezra was a builder Nehemiah was a builder and they were building different things some were building the Temple some were building the walls some it was a restoration of worship come on Brother come on just like you know so there were four four there were four stages of the Locust that came to destroy so God send different stages right Ezra neiah Zer Joshua it was not one person doing the work it was it was done in different stages and you find that even when they went it was different decrees that send them back to build and the prophet when he preached the 70 weeks of Daniel he had to be very specific of the decree by which we started to calculate the 70 weeks because there were multiple decrees because there were different stages Hallelujah so the story of restoration the caterpillar the canker worm the Palmer worm and the lockers the four horses how many knows that amen and then the restoration comes with Martin Luther he does one part and then John Wesley comes it does another part he restores Holiness in the church he restores sanctification in the church Martin Luther restores grace through faith Hallelujah and then the Pentecostals they come they restore the gifts in the church and when the gifts are restored the Church is not yet complete then you need the seed which is the spoken word then for you to have the word you need to have a prophet am then God sends Elijah to restore the fullness of the word back in the church so we can't go back to gifts because if we if gifts was the climax then God did not need to send a prophet after Aza the prophet was sent after Aza because Aza was not the final stage because the prophet says that you see it says the Pentecost is a type of Mary y because remember Mary left Jesus at the Feast of Pentecost right when he she denied the supernatural birth amen when she says I and your father were looking for you and the word corrects the error amen amen he never said my mother he says woman I have to be at my father's business Hallelujah so the Pentecostals they were hugging the seed but it was not the true seed because the gifts are not everything because remember Abraham had other Sons like ishma and other sons from from with with k how many knows that and the Bible says that he gave them gifts and he sent them away but unto Isaac he gave him everything that he had so the love of God to the church is not on gifts but it's through election amen amen that's why the Bible says to the elect lady amen the love of God the prophet says in the church ages is elective love how great The Father's Love how vast Beyond his measure John says behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we must be called the Sons of the Living God God's love is not it's not it's not manifest by billions of dollars it's not manifest by by cars and houses it's manifested by his election amen because God is very specific amen when he was here upon the Earth he was choosing the disciples he never sent he went never went to zip recruiter and said you know send me a resumes and and and and Linked In I'm looking for disciples no the Bible says he prayed all night and in the morning he went and he he chose the disciples and he knew exactly whom he wanted and he called them by name Peter bomo Andrew and the different ones how many how many can say Amen that was the election of God and Judas was specifically for the work that you are supposed to do so for you to be in the Church of God it's not by your choice it's by God's election because Jesus Christ said you did not choose me but I chose you he chose us before the foundation of the world and David says what is man that thou art mindful of him what is the son of men that you should visit him he says even if I make my bed in hell thou art with me for before my substance was formed amen you you saw my name you saw my members and you wrote them in the book of life amen when I was yet unperfect yet you wrote my members in the book of life right Hallelujah so we have three Babylons in the Bible the first babon Babylon is called Babel it's the same word it was the bab of nimrod and the second Babylon is the Babylon of Nebuchadnezzar and the last Babylon is in the Book of Revelation which is called mystery Babylon it's called mystery Babylon because it's still the same Babylon but it's now hidden amen it's not as apparent as the first two because the first two they're pretty easy to know that you know this is Nebuchadnezzar he comes from Babylon which I think they call Modern Day Iraq right and he had you know he tried to impersonate God he had the river flowing through the throne that was Babylon in the middle of the Bible amen but now we have got mystery Babylon now what does Babylon mean the prophet says it means confusion Babylon is confusion and we live in a time of confusion we live the confusion is so much so until people have to debate I don't know if I can say this online I don't want your page to be taken down people have to debate what a man is what a woman is Amen in Africa we only have two right men and a woman that's it but I come here they say it's a spectrum what do you mean it's a spectrum the Bible says male and female created ye them that's what God did but because we are in Babylon there's confusion until people can't even tell if there is a there a man or a woman it's a spirit of confusion upon the people and Isaiah said I saw the Earth staggering that's right like a drunken man amen it says Darkness shall be upon the Earth and gross Darkness shall be upon the people am but I like that he says but but they shall be what amen hallelujah amen so because there's confusion God has to do something for his people there has to be an absolute amen there has to be a standard amen then God sends zerubabel amen and he comes out of Babylon because when they were in Babylon they were confused they had lost their identity they had lost their worship they had lost everything they had lost their land they had lost some of them were born there they had raised up there they had lost their language they were in confusion some were Methodist some were Presbyterians some were Baptist some were different Pentecostals there was a lot of confusion right everyone had an interpretation of the of their own of the Bible That's Right amen but then God sent zerubabel Amen to rebuild the house to restore worship amen because remember remember restoration without the word is just a Reformation amen Joshua was a wonderful reformer but you know what they had a Revival when they found the book of the law amen before they the book of the law they did not have a Revival right so the Revival comes when the word comes amen so the real Revival is in the bride amen it's not in drums and music and guitars that's fine but the real Revival comes when people find the word and they come back to the word then you have a Revival that's why the prophet says you have never seen a Revival we had a Reformation but now we are having a bride Revival and it's not like our kind of way of looking at things where there's 5,000 people in a stadium no sir no it's an individual Affair hallelujah it's an individual work amen because God is not a politician politicians they love group groups of people but they're not very good with individuals if you write a letter to your to to your Congressman as an individual he may the chances that he's going to respond to you it's like 1% but if you say we are a group of a million people out of Georgia and we've got this concern he's going to come down yeah because he Li they love people but they are not very good with individuals but God does not deal with groups he deals with individuals he knows your name He Knows My Name he knows how many teeth you have he knows he has numbered your hair he has not counted it he has numbered it he knows number 658 is missing hallelujah amen back in Genesis we realize and I've got many calls the reason why I'm not reading a lot of them is because I'm trying to you know mind my time right but those who read the message they know the things that I'm talking about back in Genesis we realized that different things happened back then look here for instance Babylon appeared first in Genesis because remember everything starts in Genesis Genesis is Gen it's the seed chapter now we have we have to watch Babylon it appears over here in the Bible again about the middle of the Bible and then comes all over into Revelation for the last days Babylon it begin first was the Gate of God it was then it was called then it was called Babylon and it says confusion and you will notice in the spoken many times the prophet would say Babylon confusion Babylon confusion because Babylon means confusion because when they spoke in in in many different tongues when they were trying to build that Tower they became confused that's where the word comes it's called the Tower of bab it's now a symbol of confusion just like the modern day Pentecostal Church everybody's speaking in a tongue there's no one to interpret there's no order it has become confusion Hallelujah so so so zerubabel becomes the signant now the prophet says now remember over in the Bible that tells us way back where we go to to many scriptures and prove what the Bible claims that there is a day that will not be night nor day just a dismal day organizations and church and enough to be saved but in the evening time it shall be light so the prophet is talking about a prophecy I believe it's in Zechariah I can't remember the book where the Bible says that you know there shall be a dismal day but in the evening time it shall be light amen now this is a day that is called dismal because it's a day of confusion so God sends a light because there is confusion amen because confusion is coming from a dismal day and the prophet says the most dangerous time to drive is when the S the Sun is setting it's it's not day it's not night it's a dismal time that is the worst time to be driving because you can't turn on your lights the sun is not there even if you turn them on they're not very effective it's not way dark it's not it's a very we the prophet called it a dismal day right and I would like to call it a nightmare the prophet says I'll tell you what where the a lost person goes when they die that's right the prophet says he goes into a nightmare they can't go in the presence of God because they are not saved but they come they can't come back here because their time is up and the prophet says they are lost in a nightmare it's like you're not awake you're not asleep it's a nightmare it's like a dismal day hallelujah it's like a state of being lukewarm right amen it's it's the same thing friends you're not cold you're not hot and that's the spirit of the day amen for you to overcome you have to understand your enemy if you go for for a boxing match they have what they call enemy profiling you have to know your enemy my enemy weighs uh uh 600b he likes to eat bacon you know he he this is how he works out if you know your enemy like America they spend millions and billions of just studying what does China have they've got these types of sheep they've got these types of of drones because if you don't know your enemy you're not going to win the fight that's right so the enemy for this age is lukewarmness amen the devil is not going to stop you from coming to church the devil is not going to stop you from coming to a coup meeting or a youth meeting the devil will make you do all those things but he will keep you look warm because it's the spirit of the age Hallelujah until people can't even say Amen in church anymore people can't even sing during song service people can't even show up for church they want everything delivered door Dash Uber Eats their religion it has to be done online on but let me tell you something the Rapture cannot be ubber the Rapture you have to be in person Hallelujah you can't you can't do it digitally no sir you have to be there physically you have to show up and you have to be changed because the Bible says in a moment in the twinkle of an eye we shall be changed a thisal day amen and this dismal day requires a signant amen now this is a signant ring that I was talking about now the prophet says here and he took me in he clothed me like the father with the prodal son put a new garment upon me the Garment was not mine His Garment of his righteousness he put upon me and a wedding ring upon my finger now this ring represented Authority if you're an adopted son God gives you a ring in other words you can sign checkes in in your father's name so God gives you the authority when he adopts you so that's what God that's what this prodal son you know was he was given a robe of righteousness he was given a ring upon the finger because why would a father give his son a ring it's not like he's getting married to him it's a it's a it's a ring if you read other other message the prophet explains it's it's a ring of authority it's a it's a ring of sunship amen amen now the the Bible says here the hands of zerubabel have laid the found Foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it and thou sh know that the Lord of host has sent me unto you in other words zerubabel was to bring the foundation he was to lay the foundation and bring the headstone now what does it mean in our day of course Paul laid the foundation but for the church to be completely restored because remember the church is a building because in in the Book of Revelations you have got a new Jerusalem coming out of heaven right there is a physical City and there there is also a symbol of the Bride so when you read about Jerusalem in the Bible sometimes it talks about the Physical City but sometimes it's talking about the bride amen that's why Paul says in Hebrews and in Galatians that our mother is Jerusalem but Mount Si belongs unto ishma is the mother of of those that are under the law that's what that's what Paul says so so so when talk about Jerusalem it's it's it's a woman it's a church like like the Bible says in my father's house are many mansions and when Jesus Christ said behold I go and prepare a place for you amen the prophet explains that he's talking about theophanies the body that you will go into because Paul says this if if if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have another one waiting for us and Jesus looked at the temple and he says destroy this Temple after 3 days I raise it up and the people were very slow to catch it said what do you mean it took our fathers 40 years to build this and you are saying you're going to rebuild it in 3 days they were thinking about the physical Temple but he was talking about the real Temple which is the body of Christ and that's what we are talking about today when we're talking about Zer real building just like the Bible the Bible says the the glory of the later house shall be greater than the glory of the former House people heard that and they thought oh the Temple of J is going to be so greater than the Temple of Solomon nor when the temple was finished the the ones that saw the Temple of Solomon the Bible says they wept because that's not what they were expecting but those prophecies they were referring to the Future Temple that Christ was going to build amen hallelujah amen so the the book of Zechariah is very prophetic like if you want to understand what's happening in Israel you read Zechariah you know go Israel is the apple of my eye who touches Israel you know those things you find them in Zechariah it talks about the the two Olive branches it talks about the seven candlesticks the eyes of the lord it's in the the book of Zechariah is an end time book just like the book of of of of Daniel because because zerubabel and in Zechariah they were they were rebuilding and they've got Daniel who was also kind of like another Gentile prophet in a way not that he was Gentile but he prophesied a lot on the Gentile kingdoms if you read the spoken word called the beginning and the end of the Gentile dispensation the prophet was talking about Daniel so so so the Bible says that he shall his hands shall lay the foundation and His Hands shall finish it in other words he shall bring the former Reign and he shall bring the later rain amen So when you say he shall lay the foundation Paul says this Foundation can no other men lay another Foundation it has to be the same foundation so the prophet comes he lays the foundation how does he laid the foundation he takes people back to the teaching of Paul amen he's not bringing something new he's bringing the same Foundation that was laid by Paul amen and he says I preach what Paul preached I baptized the way Paul baptized so he is laying the foundation but not a New Foundation but he is restoring us back to the foundation of the P Apostolic fathers and he preaches the the message the spoken word is the Original Seed amen and he says I have planted the seed I have laid the foundation and Billy Graham has planted a seed or Rob has planted the seed and that's why he had problem with the lat rain Brethren because they were trying to bring a lat rain before the seed was planted but he planted the seed and he called it a teaching a Revival which which he called Mur in Hebrew the teaching rain how many knows that the the restoration of the Bride tree you can read about that so zerubabel is a type of the end time prophet and zerubabel is also a type of Christ amen scriptures have compound meanings so he lays the foundation and the Bible says that with his hands amen hallelujah amen now the prophet says we have gone by experience not by the word away with measuring as your measuring line there's only one plump line only one rod that is the word of God now watch carefully and get this now if you read this scripture in Zechariah it says that we shall rejoice when we when they shall see the plummet in the hands of zerubabel and when he brings the headstone there shall be shoutings of Grace Grace unto it how many knows that amen now what is a a plummet it's a plum line so the prophet says it's not an experience it says we have gone by experiences oh brother I was praying and I saw a vision that's good but we cannot build the church based on that because I have my own experience you have your own experience maybe when you received the Holy Ghost you did you know certain things you know there something happened to you when I received the Holy Ghost I had my but we cannot build on experiences and you know I'm afraid that we we are going we are now going back back to experiences right we are going back to personalities we are going back to following people instead of the word of God and the prophet says there's only one Plum line amen because Z hag said he shall be a signate Zechariah says he shall have the plumet in other words he shall have the the the level he shall have the standard so the prophet has the standard now in the message the absolute the prophet says the Constitution of the United States is the absolute how many knows that amen and we know that the Bible is the what is the absolute amen but now if we have a dispute we say the absolute is the Constitution amen now is the Constitution going to interpret itself it's just a piece of paper so if you have a cult tional dispute you you have to consult the Constitution but you can't consult a piece of paper right there has to be someone who interpret the Constitution for you am and that person is called a Justice amen so you can say the Constitution is the absolute but it does not speak without a Justice amen without a Justice is just a piece of paper right good because everyone has their own interpretation of the Constitution but you have to go before a quot and a man will say I am chief justice Roberts this is what the Constitution says not everyone is qualified to interpret the Constitution you may interpret but your interpretation is no Authority because it is not given by the laws of the land righten so every Theologian can have their own interpretation everyone can have their own interpretation of the Bible amen but when it comes to authoritative guidance there's a Justice and the justice is a prophet because the word of the Lord comes to a prophet everyone is a Bible friends yeah right so who is right how do we know right how will God judge the Earth y right right it's a confusion amen this one say according to my Bible women can preach fine according to my Bible I can do this according to my Bible drinking is fine according to to the Bible some people believe polygamy is all right how then are we going to come out of this confusion God sends a signant and it says in the evening time there shall be light and the path of Glory you shall surely find we were not going to be able to find the PATH yeah amen so we're not following amen We are following the word amen because remember hor the Bible says in in Malachi before it talks about before he talks about Elijah he says remember horb what happened is horb God said I'm going to talk to you directly and the people said no no no no no we are we are afraid don't talk to us directly send a prophet right you speak to Moses Moses will speak to us so because of Horeb there is a a principle that God says he will not do anything the Lord thy God sh will not do anything except he declares it by his servants the prophets amen it became a principle because of Horeb amen and remember they a dispute with Aaron and and and deliverance oh who are you to rle over us who are you to tell us what to do God says oh you know what I'm going to settle this issue bring me your roads Y and they brought 12 roads and they put them in the ark y everyone had a claim oh I'm I'm Reuben I'm the oldest yeah oh I'm I'm I'm Isa I'm a very Z tribe oh I'm I'm Joseph you know we are the tribe of Joseph we the perfect people you know and God says bring me your your your roads and the road that BDS is the one that I've chosen in other words the one that is Vindicated right amen so Aaron and his family they were Vindicated to become Levites amen right so a prophet is also Vindicated by God Amen a prophet is not Vindicated on the internet he is not Vindicated on television he's vind Vindicated by God at his own time in his own way and it's not subject to debate just like you can debate whether gender is a spectrum that's up to you but before God it's it's it's finished and you could win an argument you could win the argument in this day and age yeah but that doesn't mean you are right amen they're doing it in colleges right they are proving I can prove to you they are 15 genders okay good but is that true it's not Revelation CH 21 verse 16 the Bible says and the city lith four square and the length is as large as the breath and he measured the city with the read 12,000 follows the length and the breath and the height of it are equal and he measured the W thereof 140 and4 cubits according to the measure of a men that is the Angel so the angel measured the city and the measurements are according to the measurements of the Angel which is a man that's what the Bible says right it right so he measured and and and he physically measured the prophet says it's 1500 this way it's 1500 that this way it's like from here from Georgia to to Maine and so on that's what he says right but he also measured the spiritual the bride amen says I saw a vision the preview of the Bride says stay in line stay in line so the the prophet he is called The Plum line because you cannot be a builder without a plum Lind that's why zerubabel the Bible says he shall have the plumet amen it shall come by Grace but the Z shall have the plummet because there's no Builder without a plummet right that's why many some of the houses they looking like this yeah right anyone can build friends but the question is is it going to pass the inspection of the state some of the houses they have no windows some of the houses Jesus Christ is spoke and he says he says be careful how you build says some will build upon a rock some will build upon dirt some will build you know it says you know it gives different scenarios it says the flood came and it it ran over the house the winds came it ran over the house but some built upon the Solid Rock Amen so Zer measured the city so for the building to pass it has to be we have the right measurements Zer has to tell you how long what does uncut here means Z is to tell you the qualification of a minister Z because you cannot build a you cannot build the temple without God's measurements right amen and the measurements they come from a prophet right amen and the prophet Moses he gave those measurements to a man called baso baso was a type of the fivefold Ministry though he was not only a prophet but God gave him the spirit to take from the prophet and to build and to bring the house of the Lord amen and because baso had the same spirit that was upon Moses amen but he took the measurements of Moses and he put them in order and he brought the house of the Lord amen but today people they don't want measurements that's why we are dying you know amen because even our food portions it's not measured I I say give me extra extra extra large fries and two extra sides of guacamole and sprinkle some honey drizzle on top of it there's no measurements it's as as much as you can afford that's where we are dying right amen that's why we perishing people right you you are what you eat and that's why the people they also dying spiritually because they don't want God's measurements they want to wear whatever they want they want to say whatever they want they want to do whatever they want they want to you know it's called self worship that's right brother amen when you worship God you ask him God what you would want me to do yeah but when you worship yourself you do whatever you want and you don't listen to anybody because you you do you can I tell you something even God cannot go above his word yeah right that's what the Bible says amen God is the only King who abides by his word that's why he could have sent thousands of angels to die upon the cross but he could not do it because it was contrary to his principles because the Angels could not redeem men because they are not kings men to men so God here to fulfill all righteousness so God is a king that exists in his word amen so if God is not above his word who who are we to be above the word who are we Jesus Christ himself he fulfilled the word to the dot and he says Lord I come in the volume of the book to do thy will oh Lord he did not come with one quotation he did not come with one scripture he came in the volume of the book he fulfilled every scripture that was concerning him amen and it says who shall who shall who shall condemn me of sin search the scriptures they are they that testify of me set your Bible what I'm doing is exactly what is written am but today people want to worship themselves y they don't want to be told what to do because we are living in confusion y people want to follow Tik Tok they want to follow Instagram no one wants to follow the Bible yeah come on brother no one wants to follow they want no nobody ask God what can I what you think about this should I get this job should I do this should I go people don't want that we think that's Liberty that is not liberty no that is rebellion right amen it's a spirit of the age you know they don't want a prophet they don't want a Bible they want they I want to be free free from what brother imagine if people were driving down the road anybody there was no stop signs there's no traffic lights anyone can drive whatever they want that is not Freedom that is called chaos and Anarchy and I could be a pilot and I could say I I could fly people you know would you get in that flight when I'm flying no brother I'm free I can do whatever I want yeah you know things don't work like that right right amen and he says who that who art thou great Mountain before Z rubel thou shall become plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto unto it moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands have laid this Foundation verse 10 for who has despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the what the plummet in the hands of what of zerubabel and it says with those seven they are the eyes of the Lord amen which run to and from go has seven eyes seven Messengers it's not seven eyes and a half or seven eyes and a quarter oh brother I went hunting with the prophet brother I can tell you what the message means no no no it's only seven eyes all of us are brothers amen there's no one who is higher than the other who's closer we are all brothers that's right there's no one who has got a special Ministry which is almost brother we are all the same we are brothers some are teachers some are evangelists some are pastors but we all Brothers am but but people are not satisfied with that that's right it's a trap it's a trap you always feel like the spirit of Lucifer he always wanted to be a little special a little high God has already given you something special but you people are not I feel like I always you know talk about this Lucifer I thought he had a pretty good deal was right hand man of God he was beautiful he could sing I thought he had a good package but he was not happy the guy was not happy and that's the spirit of the age people are not happy that's right oh if the government can do this for me of this of this of if only this brother can do this if this sister if my wife can do this why doesn't my husband buy me flowers every day why can't he just it's a spirit why did the deacons move me to the backseat why can't they let me sing why can't they it's a spirit of entitlement that is come upon the Earth and it takes Joy from people's hearts because you always see negative everywhere amen why did they allow this brother to preach yeah why is his accent different why does why does the pastor get get all these brothers these random Brothers they just come to church and they blast and they leave amen now if you would if we would think for a minute that the seventh Church messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit not by Mighty nor by power but by my spirit says the Lord not by organization or denomination by the by the Holy Spirit God will bring forth the church in the L last days amen so for us to be in the Rapture is going to be the grace of God that's right because God is the one that started the work he's the one that shall complete it he laid the foundation he shall bring the headstone amen I don't know about you but I wasn't looking for God when he when he came to me when the message came to me I wasn't looking for the message I wasn't looking for the Rapture I was not looking to be a minister I was going the God was going this way I was going this way amen but God by his Mercy amen he found me and he took me and he changed my life around so why should I being saved by grace now start to want to use my own works and try to figure things out how am I going to make it the one that took me is going to keep me is going to sustain me and he will see me through it's not for me to figure out things no sir it's a message of Grace friends amen he's the Good Shepherd the Bible says he will live 99 and you will go and find one that's exactly this message people would criticize brother Bram says or Roberts preaches pray for many people what about you say I have to go where God leads me am because he was looking for the seed amen he was sent to the lost sheep of the house amen Jesus left a Revival where many people were coming and rejoicing he left a Revival and he crossed a very dangerous sea where his boat almost sunk because he had to go on the other side because there was a man there who was full of demons he was backslid yeah people had written him off people were using him in Sunday school lessons yeah oh little children this is what what happens to you when when you take drugs this is what happens to you when you leave the message the guy was in the tombs he was not looking for God he was not fasting he was not praying he was not he did not have a spoken word he was in the Tomb that he was away from civilization he was away from evangelists nobody wanted to associate himself with that guy but Jesus left the Revival amen he left the 99 amen crossed a dangerous sea to find one man who was not looking for him amen because his name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah am I was like that man I was not looking for him I was not somewhere close to the message I wasn't born in Jeffersonville my father never went hunting with the prophet I depend upon him he called me in the ministry by his Gra gra I don't have a great story to talk about yeah my family is not a big name in the message I'm not known I Rely 100% upon the Lord he's the one that called me in the ministry right he's the one that knows where I should go right I don't have a great big story to to share with the people say my grandmother attended the meetings of the Prophet no sir I was like that man in the tombs amen and Jesus came and says would you be made whole I said yes Lord I want to be made whole would you be part of the Bride I said yes Lord I want to be part of the Bride what is my qualification what should I do you don't have to do anything you just have to agree you just have to agree amen amenl one day he went through the ship gate there were many different gates in the temple of Jerusalem but there was one particular gate where sheep would go into the slaughter so Jesus he goes through the ship gate I don't have time to read John and when he goes through the ship gate he is going like the Lamb of God and he comes to a pool this is a pool where they wash they used to wash Lambs to be sacrificed and the ship gate was made by the priests if you read the book of Ezra it was a type of Salvation and it had no bowls it had no nuts because salvation is without condition come it's a free whoever is thirsty come and drink it goes through the ship gate as the Lamb of God and there are multitudes of people who are trying to get into the pool of Bethesda but what did he do he goes to one man because that man's name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life amen many there were many people who who are in your family but you are the only one who saw the message that was coincidence God knew exactly what he's doing amen I can prove to you that by the scripture that everyone who is in this message is by predestination amen you cannot just hophazardly say I'm I'm I'm part of it no God is a very jealous God and he's a very specific God Amen if you're not part of it it will throw you out people say oh he left the message no sorry you cannot leave the message that's right the message will leave you yeah right come on brother the prophet one time he was in in Africa he went to a country called mmek if you have been to mosic it's it's like the Amazon in terms of like chaos right I've been there you the grass some of the place it's this tall they are not wide rows there's not zip code Google doesn't work Siri doesn't work if you use Siri you get lost but the prophet was there and the Holy Ghost would tell him turn right right turn left go this way and you go to a little heart and these little hearts they all look the same but the Holy Ghost would direct him said I want to go to that heart there's a man that is sick and he will go there say are you a Christian no would you want to be a belief I said yes God knew where that man was amen you might have been in a jungle you might have been somewhere but God knew that I have got a seed somewhere in mosm Beek and looking for that last one that's why we are here until that last one comes we're going to be here we'll pay our mortgages we'll pay our bills we we will come to church we'll do all these things until we find the last one all the missionary efforts printing books is because we looking for that one person as soon as he comes in then the door closes amen it's different from flying in flying if you if you come when the gate is closed if you miss the final boarding call that's it but but when it comes to the Lord there's no final barding call The Rapture will not happen until you are ready until the last one comes it's not there's no final board in cor where God is saying God will make sure that those whom he has predestinated they will make it for the Rapture one time the prophet he he was in a vision I'll close in about 10 minutes and he had a bleeding lamp blah blah blah and then as he as he listened in the vision he turned to a voice and the voice started saying mil Town M Town mtown how many knows that there was a little girl called gei Kata she was sick for many years and the prophet left a Revival to go to geata because geata was a lamp like David says God he helped me to take to snitch the lamp from the mouth of the Lions some of you when God took you you were in the mouth of the lion you might be you might have scars but at least you're not in the belly of the lion amen you might have deep scars but I'm thankful for those scars because every scar has a lesson behind it every scar makes you remember where God took you from a I'd rather be scarred and saved come on brother than to be in the belly of the lionen hallelujah amen and go David would not give up on the lamp I can give up the pastor can give up we as people can give up but God does not give up he will never give up on his own amen I don't care how many tattoos they have I don't care how many how many whiskey they drink if you are a son of God God will bring you back anyhow amen hallelujah brother the prophet would tell God would tell the prophet go to South Africa shall meet a man called Sydney Jackson you shall do this go to Derber in South Africa God is very specific one time there was a colored man he was riding in a chariot he was reading the Bible he did not understand what he was reading about right amen just like me he was reading all these things biscuits and gravy Like Biscuits to me biscuits are cookies how can you have biscuits with gravy oh my M my mom used to make kung grease what is co grease I don't have what is you know we don't have where I come from so this color man was reading all these things not understand then there was a man who was having a Revival somewhere in Georgia and God says leave the Revival I have a lost lamp that needs help yeah and what happens he disappeared and he appeared in a chariot Y and he says sir do you understand what you are reading he says no sir and he was honest and many times we lose we miss the day of our Vis visitation amen because we are not honest but the unac was honest he says I don't understand one time the prophet asked bipo after preaching the future home he says do you understand he says yes sir he says Paul do you understand he says no I don't understand say you don't have to understand you have to believe it so Philip shows up to the unach and he explained to him what the Isaiah meant maybe he was reading Isaiah 53 says Isaiah 53 it's talking about a man called Jesus he came and he died maybe he was reading Malachi 4 it says God s shall send a Prophet Elijah the Prophet this Prophet came and the man was bap ized there and after he was baptized Philip disappeared it that that that that never made it on CNN or Fox News but it's there in the Bible it's not what people can see on the outside it's what God sees amen it's a story that did not make it on Christian networks yeah or on Facebook or Instagram it was just a private conversation between philli and the Uno amen and that's what the third pool is about it's not a public show when the prophet raised the fish to life he was not in a public setting he was not in church he was going about his business amen when the prophet shot the squ he was not in church he was not in front of 5,000 people he was going about his business when the tumor was healed of sister meeting that was not a public show it was just a need a regular need Lord help my wife friends that's why where we are God is not interested with our religious F and groups and camps those things are fine it's what happens out there that's where the rubber meets the road when you are alone at work when you are doing your plumbing job and just feel a sweet spirit and you say let me just pray and God does something maybe you can't find something you're wondering how can I fix this say Lord please help me then God just helps you things just change and you can't explain it to anyone but you know that there's something that's right Hallelujah so Zer was the sign I'm going to close if the musicians want to come the prophet says let me close my laptop cuz if I don't close it I won't finish the prophet talks about the seventh seal because remember we said a Signet is a seal now the prophet is not the seventh seal but he has got a lot to do with the seventh seal because he says there was an angel on my right who meant more to me more than the other angels and he kept talking about that angel because the seventh seal is the coming of the Lord amen and the prophet preached a message called The Rapture in the message there after the prophet reads Thessalonians in Thessalonians says the Lord himself shall descend that's right shall descend how does he descend he descend he descends with a voice with a shout with a trumpet and the prophet says you know he does all these three things as his descending and we know that the shout you know it's a it's a message going forth to gather the people so the seventh still is the coming of the Lord but there's a forerunner to forun the coming of the Lord amen there's a man who is sent to reveal to people the mystery of his coming Amen to reveal to people the mysteries of the Bible amen so that people can see Christ in the word in its fullness so zerubabel is a Signet he's a seal and he is also connected with the seventh seal he is not the seventh seal but he is so much connected to the seventh seal if you can read between the lines what I'm talking about Amen Let Us bow our hearts if we can stand upon our feet Heavenly Father we thank you Lord Jesus Christ this evening Lord in a world with millions and billions of people you are a God that works in mysterious ways there were many widows in zerath but you chose one little Widow by your grace there were many lepers in Syria but you went to Naman father you we can never explain or understand why David says what is me that you are mindful of where am I Lord tonight I thank you Father for making me see this message of the hour it's the greatest privilege Lord of my life to to see the word revealed in our day many prophets of old they longed to see this day people like Daniel they wanted to understand and you said seal up the book seal up the words of this prophecy amen and till the end father we are the people of the end and we know that the enemy is coming with all kinds of confusion there's confusion in politics there's confusion in religion confusion with in things in science there's confusion everywhere there's depression there's anxiety anxiety because of confusion we pray that you help your people Lord help us father to follow the small still voice as the prophet says the message hearing his voice help us Lord to hear your word help us father to be anchored in the message of the hour knowing that we did not follow cly deis the fables but we followed the Vindicated Prophet we thank you Lord bless this church bless brother Samuel

time to rest right amen well he said come to me all that are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest sometimes we may think as our brother said Babylon we're in confusion we're in here but we're not confused amen we're called out of this age we're to a new part to where we are not confused to where it's not we listen the light that's here is US amen the light that's here is US right that's what the brother was he was talking about the seventh seal and we're we're beginning to study some on that too and I remember brother ver said the seventh seal is what the end of all things all right the end of all things now remember you and I are end time people right right we are the ones who's the end who the end of the world the Bible tells us amen that's right who the end of the world's come upon so who's the seventh seal oh we know it's Christ but where's Christ he's in his bride we are the seventh SE that's right that's right brother Brown come and brought zable he put everything together but there had to be somebody come to that headstone that's right somebody's got to come to it here for us to get out of here he got to come here so we can leave right brother Brown started it he gave us everything we needed now it's my job and your job to be the end of all things that's right brother B he said the end of the strugg in the world he gave us a bunch of of but when I was we were singing that song I won't need any rest anymore that's right right we'll be at total rest am for an eternity am that's right but we going to start on this side having a little bit of rest that's right get along with God sometime do it more than ever before get along with God and let him talk to you amen it's like a brother said the other day he said quit talking let the Lord talk to us sometimes maybe we talk too much maybe we need to sit down and listen listen brother R said he was sit and waiting he said he hear it coming what was it he was sitting listening for it to come you said oh that was for a prophet well that's kind of that's for me and you too we're prophetic people that's right amen we're to get it in the same line that he got it in right come on he's got the first fruits but we've got to get it in the same line he got it in that's right cuz when we he talks about creating squirrels we're talking about creating atmospheres we're talking about creating Eternal people here that's right here amen not a little squirrel a person right so that's what he's looking for he's looking for people to be the end of all things that was good that brought that brought a good a Clarity to me on that about brother Brown said the seventh seal was the end of all things well what who is the end of all things we're the end of all things amen amen read the Bible it's very very adamant it says to whom the ends of the world have come that's us to whom what must be it must be humans that's right to whom it didn't say to Chevrolet or or Ford or or house it said to whom that's a person to whom the end of the world have come to we are the seventh seal and we'll get into that a little bit more because if you're not unfolded the devil's still there that's right amen but if you'll unfold who you going to unfold Christ right and remember he wasn't confused Christ never was confused that's right he never did anything wrong never never had anything that he had to say I'm sorry I did that well if we're the end of all things here today and he was the son of man and the son of man Ministry is here I believe it 100% that's right that here is where we're going to get it we're not going to get it there that's right we can rest beyond the river all we want to but you better get into the rest here because what's the new birth the new birth is rest that's right it puts your soul at rest amen if you have turmoil it shouldn't be in your soul if you're not if you're not born again it is in your soul amen but you have turmoil in your spirit realm that's right we
