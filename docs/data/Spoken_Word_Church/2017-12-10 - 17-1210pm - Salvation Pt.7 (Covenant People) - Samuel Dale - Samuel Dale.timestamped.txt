[9:41] name Jonah - remember we're on salvation
[9:53] but I will sacrifice unto thee with the
[9:56] voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that I
[9:59] have mild salvation is of the Lord in
[10:03] the Lord spake unto the fish and what
[10:06] did it do what a salvation name
[10:09] deliverance what did it happen and it
[10:12] had vomited out Jonah upon the dry land
[10:15] so he was delivered so we're on dealing
[10:20] with sanctification
[10:21] alright now let's read this and it'd be
[10:24] a lengthy part so just bear with us of
[10:28] Genesis 15 because I want to try today
[10:32] if I can to finish up the Old Testament
[10:36] or the tops and the shadows because
[10:39] that's what we're dealing with the Old
[10:40] Testament is tops and shadows of the new
[10:43] and we want to try to end that if we can
[10:46] and start in the New Testament then with
[10:48] it in an understanding chapter 15 verse
[10:53] 1
[10:53] after these things the word of the Lord
[10:55] came unto Abram and a vision saying fear
[10:57] not Abram I am thy shield and I seed in
[11:01] great reward what a wonderful thing for
[11:03] God to say about you right and Abram
[11:07] said Lord God what will give me seeing I
[11:10] go childless and the steward of my house
[11:13] is this eva's are of Damascus now
[11:16] evidently Abram must have been having
[11:19] this bearing on his mind called why
[11:22] would verse 1 be like it is and in verse
[11:25] 2 and you know and he'd say unto the
[11:28] Lord all right and Abram said Behold to
[11:31] me thou has given no seed and lo worn
[11:35] one born in my house is mine heir and
[11:37] behold the word of the Lord came unto
[11:39] him saying this shall not be thine heir
[11:42] but he that shall come forth out of
[11:45] thine own bowels she'll be dying and I
[11:48] remember that it's gonna come out him so
[11:51] why does he doubt later all of these
[11:53] other things you know all right and he
[11:56] brought him forth abroad and said
[11:59] looking out toward heaven and tell the
[12:02] stars if thou be able to number them and
[12:05] he said unto him so shall thy seed be
[12:08] and he believed I love this one and he
[12:11] believed in the Lord and it was counted
[12:13] and he counted it to him for
[12:16] righteousness he said unto him I am the
[12:18] Lord that brought thee out of ur of the
[12:21] Chaldees to give thee this land to
[12:23] inherit it and he said Lord God whereby
[12:25] shall I know that I shall inherit it now
[12:28] he's gotten the land he was on a child
[12:32] thinking about it and concerned about no
[12:35] no offspring now it flops over and God's
[12:39] talking to him about land because he
[12:42] tells him playing up here you're gonna
[12:45] have a child it's coming from your
[12:47] bowels right now he falls to the land
[12:51] once and he said Lord got worse I shall
[12:55] I know that I shall inherit it and he
[12:58] said unto him take me an heifer of three
[13:00] years old and a she-goat of three years
[13:02] old and around what three years old and
[13:04] a Turtledove
[13:05] and a young pigeon and he took unto him
[13:07] all these and divided them in the mist
[13:11] and laid each piece one against another
[13:13] but the birds divided he not that's the
[13:17] type of divine healing the Prophet says
[13:19] there's not divided and when the fowls
[13:21] came down upon the carcasses Abram drove
[13:23] them away and when the Sun was going
[13:26] down a deep sleep fell upon Abram and
[13:28] lowered Hara
[13:29] of great darkness fell upon him no I'm
[13:34] sorry to keep you standing to do it
[13:37] but remember we start off Abram worried
[13:39] about thinking about a child and then it
[13:42] falls to God talking about land and and
[13:44] you know you'll inherit this and then he
[13:48] starts making a promise and this is what
[13:50] the Prophet said one day because you
[13:52] read that there's no way to know what
[13:54] he's talking about
[13:55] I mean honestly you read it find out
[13:57] what he's talking about he's going this
[13:59] way he's going this way he's over here
[14:01] he's over there this is what the Prophet
[14:05] said he said Abraham was a prophet and
[14:09] said would know what God meant in what
[14:13] he was saying I love that you know his
[14:16] son was going down to deep sleep fell
[14:18] upon Abram and lo and horror of great
[14:20] darkness fell upon him and he said unto
[14:23] Abram know first surety thy seed shall
[14:25] be a stranger in a land that is not
[14:29] theirs and shall serve them and they
[14:31] shall afflict them for hundred years
[14:33] Egypt right Israel into Egypt for
[14:36] hundred years right telling them what's
[14:38] going to happen to the people in the
[14:39] natural and also that nation whom thou
[14:42] shalt serve what I judge and afterwards
[14:44] shall they come so they come out with
[14:48] great substance and thou shalt go to thy
[14:50] fathers in peace and I shall be buried
[14:53] in a good old age once he's right down
[14:56] to his death that's what I said you read
[14:58] this and then you tell me what he's
[15:00] talking about he goes this way close
[15:03] that way back all right but in the
[15:06] fourth generation they shall come for
[15:07] the other four then Nick with the other
[15:09] am arises not yet fool and it came to
[15:12] pass that when the Sun went down and it
[15:15] was dark behold a smoking furnace
[15:18] and a burning lamp that pies between
[15:20] those pieces once and in the same day
[15:23] the Lord made a covenant with a from
[15:26] saying unto thy seed have I given this
[15:30] land from the river of Egypt unto the
[15:35] great river of the river Euphrates any
[15:37] names of places names all of it but now
[15:40] I remember what I said there the other
[15:43] day he never gave Abram the whole world
[15:49] the only gave him part of it
[15:51] there was a reason for that you may be
[15:53] seated the Lord had his blessing to the
[15:56] reading of the word all right never said
[15:59] we we sometimes don't consider maybe the
[16:08] things and I've tried to make it a point
[16:13] that we're dealing with salvation
[16:21] meaning deliverance
[16:23] it can mean those things but it's also
[16:26] meaning of talking about salvation in
[16:31] the basis of you know to you inheritance
[16:36] of eternal life and the different things
[16:38] of the word salvation that help for the
[16:41] mom and dad with us but to just think
[16:46] about it God made a covenant with
[16:52] Abraham Abram and told him all of these
[16:56] things like I said if he had not been a
[17:01] prophet he would have not known what any
[17:04] of this would be dealing with because
[17:07] I'm asking you to just take it and sit
[17:10] down and express it you're talking about
[17:14] children you're talking about land
[17:17] you're talking about promises you're
[17:19] talking about covenants you're talking
[17:21] about all kind of things that really now
[17:24] what's the statement I make or I'm
[17:26] trying to try to end it today see then
[17:29] with Abraham
[17:31] it would finally wind up the Old
[17:34] Testament as to the point of talking
[17:37] about Redemption now not that anybody
[17:41] else won't be saved no no no we're
[17:44] talking about the way things are done
[17:47] the way God does it he puts it all into
[17:51] Abraham because we're gonna get to it in
[17:54] a minute Abraham comes to the change of
[17:56] the body right so now you see that what
[18:00] I've done there Sunday I just I mean no
[18:02] Wednesday I just went so far and I had
[18:05] to stop because we said why did you quit
[18:07] it just 8:31 that have been 12:30 if I
[18:10] to finish the notes to the services but
[18:14] still now listen we've got to drop back
[18:18] because of the people not knowing what
[18:21] we've been on for a little bit to to try
[18:23] to cover brother Branham said that God
[18:28] made three covenants with mankind the
[18:35] unconditional sound uncertain sound
[18:38] sixty-two he made three covenants one
[18:42] with Adam one with Noah and one with
[18:47] Abraham or technically Abram all right
[18:51] now I know because see I look these
[18:54] things up but a random won't say on
[18:56] another you said wait a minute he just
[18:57] made two covenants couldn't he made one
[19:00] with Adam and he made one was with
[19:02] Abraham well that's true but don't leave
[19:04] no out of it you know because there was
[19:06] a covenant there made but that's the
[19:08] point that I've been driving at for you
[19:10] to see what kind of a covenant was it
[19:13] that was made with Adam we went here and
[19:20] we go through and we pick it up we go
[19:22] over in and can see many things that are
[19:25] taking place and now I've got a lot of
[19:28] scriptures in time I will not read them
[19:30] I'll just pick them and doing them
[19:32] because I want them on the internet so
[19:35] that the internet system people should
[19:38] know the scriptures that I'm using you
[19:41] know to make sure they follow the line
[19:43] all right
[19:44] yeah so there was three covenants made
[19:49] one with a brick one was Adam 1 with
[19:52] Noah and one with Abraham all right now
[19:57] what weirdo cut those covenants I asked
[20:02] you two to show it to me in it to show
[20:05] it to me in the Bible and the reading
[20:07] well what did he get her covenant now
[20:10] the covenant I read here is Abraham so
[20:12] don't get that involved you know and say
[20:14] wait a minute now
[20:15] see this is Genesis 15 so let's drop
[20:18] back to the Genesis 2 and 3
[20:20] what was the Covenant that God made with
[20:24] Adam the random say it
[20:33] he made a conditional covenant with Adam
[20:42] a conditional covenant he put conditions
[20:48] in the Covenant what was the Covenant I
[20:54] just asked a simple question Sunday
[20:57] they've been asking it over what was the
[20:59] Covenant I mean can you read what
[21:01] happened in Genesis and find that that
[21:06] there had to be a Covenant made with
[21:08] Adam on condition remember the end that
[21:15] he was put on free moral agency with a
[21:20] right to choose okay and by his choosing
[21:26] he made the wrong choice but what was he
[21:31] told before then remember how in this
[21:37] situation Adam was in according to
[21:40] blasphemous names if so was eternal
[21:43] probably said he breathed into his
[21:45] nostrils the breath of eternal life so
[21:49] then he saw was eternal his spirit and
[21:53] his body was an eternal no his body was
[21:55] a creation and he spirit would have been
[21:57] a career
[21:57] bringing in but it was not eternal all
[22:01] right didn't you come to the Prophet in
[22:04] the seal book and reading it and finding
[22:07] it that veteran says that Adam lost the
[22:14] right to the earth and the human body
[22:22] because what else did he lose the right
[22:24] up the day you eat thereof that day you
[22:27] die Adam lived separate one hundred more
[22:33] years but he finally died after the all
[22:37] right so then what happened what was the
[22:41] Covenant don't you eat of that tree of
[22:49] knowledge of good and evil right don't
[22:57] eat it there's a don't remember a
[23:01] covenant it do's and dont's he said in
[23:07] other words you eat of the Tree of Life
[23:08] and you'll remain as you are in this
[23:13] condition the Prophet even said it he
[23:18] said God gave to Adam as he was leaving
[23:24] he said he simply just renewed his life
[23:29] every day in his flesh that's what he
[23:35] done it you know because it was it would
[23:38] have been not eternal so he wouldn't
[23:42] have aged he wouldn't have done anything
[23:45] but he would renewed a brother Ron said
[23:47] that his youth was being renewed each
[23:49] day all right but now when he fell and
[23:54] he'll never lost eternal life in his
[23:56] soul now I don't you know if people say
[24:01] well they saw brother branham city lost
[24:03] eternal life you better read real good
[24:05] and you better try to understand a lot
[24:08] the code is not interpreting or it's
[24:10] correct
[24:11] a prophet with his plain common sense
[24:13] you can't have eternal life and lose it
[24:16] so Adam never lost eternal life in his
[24:19] soul but he lost the right to the earth
[24:23] and to bringing forth of you and I am i
[24:28] right
[24:29] would not it mended it they would have
[24:31] brought us forth it would have been
[24:32] spoken word multiplication rod but he
[24:34] they would have brought us forth so he
[24:37] lost that right and brought us in a
[24:42] sinful condition so now there's your
[24:47] covenant don't eat of that tree and
[24:52] everything will be all right
[24:54] you remind as you are and you've been
[24:58] okay and you'll bring forward everything
[25:00] will be done the promise we had the
[25:04] condition don't eat of that tree now I
[25:11] hope you followed the point now brothers
[25:12] will that is still right here today
[25:18] today we're still eating of the tree of
[25:21] knowledge
[25:22] oh no bless God I've I believe in
[25:25] everything the Prophet said if we doubt
[25:27] one word of the Bible which to me I put
[25:33] the prophets message the Bible put it in
[25:35] the correct order that he made mistakes
[25:37] as a human being he corrected the
[25:40] mistakes and all like that but the
[25:43] prophets the message is perfect the
[25:46] Prophet made mistakes okay we agree okay
[25:49] now in doing that then me you see that
[25:56] he lost really the redemptive part that
[26:00] would have come into view of his body
[26:05] because eventually something would have
[26:08] had to happen to it okay because it so
[26:13] was eternal or see then he lost our
[26:17] bodies and that's why we had to come to
[26:20] where we come he lost us in the basis
[26:24] and we have to come as mortal human
[26:27] beings not eternal okay what are you
[26:31] following me see then we pick up to Noah
[26:34] and the Prophet said Noah because it was
[26:38] on condition and this is the best way he
[26:42] said he said it got broke he didn't
[26:47] necessarily say Noah broke it who broke
[26:50] it he said it got broke so that's just I
[26:53] guess the best way the Prophet could do
[26:55] because I asked you to tell me one thing
[26:58] I asked it son a Wednesday tell me what
[27:03] was the covenant to Noah
[27:09] what was his covenant what was it to
[27:17] Noah don't do this and do this because
[27:22] if it was a covenant of conditions it
[27:25] had to do this in the don'ts I expressed
[27:28] it to try to get your little emphasis of
[27:31] it to get you to see that mankind in
[27:35] that day was for taking of the tree of
[27:37] knowledge the God told Adam I told Noah
[27:41] said don't you partake of that tree come
[27:48] on
[27:50] didn't Paul say I'm afraid that Satan
[27:55] will tempt you
[27:58] he said yeah but as I said a moment ago
[28:01] but we say but I'm eating of the Tree of
[28:03] Life one word is all it takes
[28:07] we're eating the tree of knowledge there
[28:11] was the tree of knowledge which was the
[28:13] entire world set up to be the way it was
[28:16] a great metropolis a great thing the
[28:20] Bible says as it was so as it is now so
[28:23] was so it was a modern civilization that
[28:26] gar all right here is Noah taking a
[28:33] hammer
[28:34] and some nails and a saw and spent 120
[28:38] years sewing boards we only had to do
[28:42] was call somebody up and say build me an
[28:45] arc make me a Titanic make it double
[28:52] proof Titanic let's see that would have
[28:57] been eating of the Tree of Knowledge
[29:00] Noah was eating of the Tree of Life
[29:03] because he's doing what God told him is
[29:07] that a truth that understanding we have
[29:09] father the point I was trying to make to
[29:12] Noah then his do's and don'ts was what
[29:16] bill that are the way I say because you
[29:21] got to admit the ark is the Covenant
[29:23] we're going to rest in the scriptures
[29:24] you know I make a covenant with you so
[29:29] Noah is building the ark according to
[29:33] what God told him there's his covenant
[29:37] he's staying away from the tree of
[29:39] knowledge of good and evil because that
[29:43] would have been the do's and the don'ts
[29:45] now naturally there were certain things
[29:48] no one had to deal with in the natural
[29:52] of you know the life so then he was a
[29:56] little bit for taking of the life
[29:58] because if he had a hammer somebody made
[30:01] it they had to solve somebody made it if
[30:04] he had wood somebody's growed it you
[30:07] understand what I'm saying
[30:08] so then he was kind of not holding 100%
[30:15] with what God said you said well he
[30:18] could have done no he could have done it
[30:19] no other way so I ain't worried about it
[30:21] I'm just making a point you to think
[30:24] about that Noah done his Adam done Noah
[30:32] lost the Prophet said he he broke it
[30:39] okay well what was his breaking of it
[30:44] you'll find out if you'll keep reading
[30:47] in the book of
[30:48] they're of Genesis you'll find out what
[30:50] happened to Noah then you'll see that he
[30:52] did break the covenant with God because
[30:55] may I quote brother Branham Noah died a
[30:59] drunk I'm quoting him Noah died a drunk
[31:06] he didn't keep the great straight
[31:08] covenant that would have been right
[31:10] as Adam stay with this side over here
[31:14] and eat right but he went over to this
[31:18] side - Noah do this keep everything
[31:24] straight and come out of this living the
[31:26] right life he goes over and he falls he
[31:32] wouldn't eternally lost no because he
[31:36] had a covenant now if you go read in
[31:40] Genesis and start with Genesis you'll
[31:42] find a lot of good things in the Word of
[31:46] God you remember how we were bringing
[31:51] out that there in Adam God never cursed
[31:57] brother brother said future home God
[32:00] never cursed Adam and Eve he cursed the
[32:03] beast part that away put him down and he
[32:07] cursed the land right he cursed the land
[32:12] but isn't it marvelous that when you
[32:16] start with Noah God starts to cleanse
[32:19] the earth and Mariah he starts to
[32:25] cleanse the earth by washing it with
[32:28] water right come on and you realize your
[32:35] body and I'm quoting from the future
[32:38] home our bodies were in the earth at
[32:41] that time so then brother Branham when
[32:45] he comes to future home he preaches what
[32:47] he said your body was justified in the
[32:50] days of Noah
[32:51] he said sanctified in the days of the
[32:54] Lord Jesus and said one day it'll be
[32:58] made eternal
[33:01] so look at what God is doing he's laying
[33:04] out his plan of salvation the fall filed
[33:08] an atom but it falls into atom of
[33:12] genesis 3:15 that the promise comes of
[33:19] the seed of the woman to come forth see
[33:24] the promise was made you remember how we
[33:25] were bringing it out which came first
[33:28] grace her law grace came before the law
[33:36] ever came into existence
[33:37] grace was before the foundation of the
[33:39] world right so you follow now all right
[33:44] now listen he cursed the Beast Genesis
[33:51] 1:14 he cursed the ground 3 and 17 just
[33:58] giving you these from Genesis he didn't
[34:01] curse Adam and Eve right around him
[34:02] future home he never cursed that he
[34:07] cursed the earth all right now when it
[34:11] comes to that then here comes Noah and
[34:14] God says violence's over the earth and
[34:19] I'm going to destroy it
[34:21] they said make you an arc I'm gonna give
[34:25] you a covenant I'm gonna give you a
[34:28] covenant that will be forever lasting he
[34:31] said they didn't say eternal he said
[34:35] everlasting I want to give you an
[34:37] everlasting covenant Noah and said all
[34:40] you got to do you make an ark you make
[34:44] it out of gopher wood verse Genesis 19
[34:50] 19 I'll establish my covenant with you
[34:54] and your seed after you
[34:58] what was his covenant starting to
[35:03] restore the plan of salvation
[35:10] what is the starting of your salvation
[35:13] justification one water baptism come on
[35:23] water baptism starting off repentance
[35:26] what about to see what happened in the
[35:29] days of Noah what I'm trying to get you
[35:33] to do is read the Bible but read it with
[35:35] common sense sometimes read what happens
[35:38] in Genesis 1 then read what happens in
[35:40] two and three and then four and just
[35:43] keep reading it like that reading to see
[35:46] what's taking place and how that God
[35:48] comes down and says you make me an ark
[35:52] of gopher wood not of metal not of any
[35:57] of these things that's the tree of
[36:00] knowledge you make it from where it will
[36:03] fit the tree of life because it would
[36:07] fit all the way down to Jesus Christ
[36:09] then he said I'll establish my covenant
[36:12] they'll remember what he said died Adam
[36:16] Adam would have been okay if you went
[36:19] straight now noise promised they didn't
[36:23] establish his covenant with him with at
[36:28] with Noah would you remember this this
[36:31] is 9 and 11 I'll establish my covenant
[36:34] with thee and neither shall any more of
[36:37] the waters ever come forward you know
[36:40] what he established yes the evidence not
[36:45] only with Noah but he established it
[36:49] with the earth it comes remember your
[36:56] body was in the earth are you following
[37:02] me a covenant your body now you tell me
[37:07] where it was that did it come from Venus
[37:08] Mars or Jupiter then no no no your earth
[37:12] comfort your body coming here it might
[37:15] have took six thousand years to get you
[37:17] yet there me and you been here but I
[37:19] didn't got nothing to do with it it's
[37:20] still the truth
[37:23] alright then you go a little further
[37:27] with Noah and watch it go from the earth
[37:32] got to remember to Abraham it would go
[37:37] to the heavens remember later on in the
[37:40] scriptures it goes to the sand of the
[37:42] seashore the number is people Noah
[37:47] starts off numbering and telling them I
[37:51] don't do this but what about the most
[37:55] marvelous thing taking place when they
[38:01] came out of the ark God made a covenant
[38:06] with Noah and his people but he made a
[38:09] covenant with the earth I will not
[38:11] destroy the world any more about water
[38:16] no you ain't gonna need it
[38:18] he's gonna burn it with fire one day
[38:20] yeah he is cuz he's got to have its
[38:22] fiery baptism because we gotta have a
[38:25] fiery baptism come on the redemptive
[38:27] plan is what I'm trying to get you to
[38:29] see so we're stopping with know what to
[38:31] see that it starts back to showing a
[38:34] covenant of redemption to mankind and
[38:40] even not only that but the world because
[38:42] I keep stating that cause I want you to
[38:44] think about because remember your body
[38:47] was in the earth our body was justified
[38:52] in the days of Noah but a runner said
[38:54] sanctified in the days of the Lord Jesus
[38:57] he said then will receive a fiery
[39:00] baptism remember we move ahead so
[39:03] disremember alright
[39:06] and he says Noah this token Genesis 9
[39:11] and 17 this is the token of the Covenant
[39:15] which I have established between me and
[39:19] all flesh that is upon the earth you
[39:26] don't think about that rainbow you're
[39:28] just thinking about it it means well no
[39:30] it just means whurling gonna be
[39:31] destroyed water tomorrow it's a covenant
[39:36] it's a covenant that you will one day
[39:40] receive the body in the right condition
[39:48] and we can see truly it has come through
[39:51] a plan of redemption and brings it out
[39:53] to the end of eternal life think about
[39:58] it just looking at your scriptures did
[40:03] you Father then know what you got your
[40:07] place no I said okay I'm doing the best
[40:12] I can we said I'm a human being and I
[40:17] can't do all of it so he died a drunk
[40:20] I'm quoting your prophet now you go to
[40:23] our and the scripture tells you and all
[40:26] of that and the things happen and all
[40:28] the situation it happened in Noah in his
[40:30] sons and all of this that in the other
[40:32] just reads your Bible but the plain
[40:35] language brother instead he died a drunk
[40:38] why because the Covenant he was
[40:43] receiving was still tied to the earth
[40:45] and had it's connections with the
[40:50] natural earth okay but what's it as it
[40:59] advances because we know that God made a
[41:03] covenant we read it in Genesis 12 and 2
[41:06] I'll make a make of thee a great nation
[41:09] and I will bless thee back up right
[41:13] before the end of verse before and sent
[41:15] unto the land and I will show thee
[41:18] everything I tried to get it across to
[41:21] you when ste Noah Adam to Noah Abraham
[41:30] everything will always be connected to
[41:33] this earth it'll be connected to this
[41:39] earth everything every covenant ever
[41:41] thought because of one thing your body
[41:46] was in that earth
[41:49] if we're gonna redeem the earth you're
[41:51] gonna redeem my body it's got to be done
[41:56] but not think about it I'll make a da
[42:00] Abram a great nation and I'll bless them
[42:05] that bless thee you know all of the
[42:06] things he said I'll give you the lay in
[42:09] the land of Canaan was in that land
[42:14] caimans a great wonderful thing to
[42:16] Israel in there we read they're worried
[42:20] the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto
[42:24] thy seed will I give this land and the
[42:30] Lord said unto Abram after that lot was
[42:33] separated from him that's jumping over
[42:38] the thirteenth chapter xiv birth after a
[42:42] lot was separated because he wasn't
[42:44] supposed to go with him like wasn't
[42:47] supposed to went with Abraham or Abram
[42:49] as we talked because he was still part
[42:54] of the old Adamic nature called mankind
[43:01] and sin in there no promise are you
[43:08] listening and not a promised a lot
[43:12] promise was Abram he takes Lord along
[43:18] with him he gets in trouble and God
[43:22] emphasizes it said now when he separated
[43:24] from lot now you look lift up thine eyes
[43:32] after you separate from lot and look for
[43:36] the place where thou art northward
[43:39] southward eastward and westward and
[43:45] still don't give him now listen he still
[43:47] don't give him the whole world that was
[43:48] the point I tried to make because he
[43:52] specifies to Abram where his boundaries
[43:55] is at well just read over our Canaanites
[43:59] and Jeff besides this size
[44:03] see because the whole world ain't in the
[44:06] Covenant with us
[44:10] he told Abram he said Abram should you
[44:14] walk through the land and said I'll give
[44:18] you every word you said to soul of your
[44:22] village you realize he's walking on you
[44:29] yeah but I'm an American born over here
[44:32] that's you got a good talk about ain't
[44:34] much common sense you ain't listening to
[44:36] the story but a Brennan said nothing
[44:45] necessarily the same gases I like to
[44:47] study the message to where I know the
[44:49] answer to that he said not to same at
[44:52] gases but he said the same elements the
[44:56] elements is in us it don't matter where
[44:58] you were born that that don't make any
[45:00] difference you know don't worry about
[45:02] that part of it and try to figure it out
[45:04] just let it be what it is
[45:06] when Abraham when he was walking he was
[45:09] walking all around Jerusalem Israel up
[45:13] and down I said I'll give you everywhere
[45:17] you put your foot there's a covenant a
[45:22] possession but what was the point to
[45:29] Abram walk through the land neighbor who
[45:35] still comes up and he said Lord I've got
[45:40] to land but said you've mentioned down
[45:44] through here of me and my seed that I
[45:49] don't have any now you see why he
[45:52] appears in Genesis 15 were read and he
[45:56] starts talking about I don't have any
[45:58] seed God has already spent the whole
[46:02] time behind him 12 through 15 describing
[46:06] the seed that would come forth and let
[46:10] alone be in the seed that would come
[46:12] from genesis 3:15 and
[46:15] seed which is Christ as we come over the
[46:17] river in the scripture pick him up
[46:19] because it was Abraham the seed of
[46:23] Abraham by faith which is Jesus Christ
[46:28] all right
[46:32] but hey vroom says Lord you talked a lot
[46:37] about me you've mentioned a lot of
[46:40] things by the way no children it's okay
[46:46] we'll take care of that and he wouldn't
[46:51] it so hard how he could handle it first
[46:55] I love it because he starts off and it
[46:57] says that Abram believed God you know
[47:06] his name was Abraham start with his
[47:08] Abram right we'll get to that in a
[47:12] minute
[47:12] so he didn't have a lot to do he had
[47:15] justification he had thoughts of
[47:18] sanctification a cleansing of the land
[47:20] and the bringing forth but he doesn't
[47:24] have the example yet of the baptism of
[47:26] the Holy Ghost but he's looking at land
[47:31] he said Lord where do I get much
[47:35] children that you've been telling me
[47:37] about he said okay I'm gonna show you
[47:42] and like I said he said Abraham wasn't a
[47:46] prophet so he puts Abraham to sleep
[47:48] showing him he's gonna be out of his
[47:50] control right we read it he put him to
[47:53] sleep
[47:54] took him out of it showed him the
[47:57] darkness of Hell and that we all
[47:58] deserved it
[47:59] but then he showed him that he was gonna
[48:03] bring forth and it said eighteenth verse
[48:05] and said the same day God made a
[48:09] covenant with Abram remember his name
[48:15] was Abram to start with he had a son
[48:18] named Exmoor well his name was Abram but
[48:24] he had no son named Isaac until his name
[48:26] was changed
[48:29] so then the bible's ride said take that
[48:32] son not only son he's talking to Abraham
[48:35] he ain't talking to Abram Abrams the guy
[48:38] done gone he's talking to Abraham he
[48:43] said take thy son thine only son of Dolf
[48:45] him he didn't take excellent Isaac both
[48:49] he took Isaac up see it's the plan of
[48:53] redemption you understand what I'm
[48:55] saying the plan of redemption is all the
[48:57] way through the Bible and it's showing
[49:00] because of the Prophet being able to
[49:05] give us the right answers just read the
[49:09] message get the unconditional covenant
[49:12] and listen to it you know them it's
[49:15] listen to the whole message you know 50
[49:18] years I've been listening to it we ought
[49:20] to know a little bit about it you know
[49:23] studies a little bit but to study the
[49:28] plan of redemption that plan of
[49:32] redemption was spoke up from Genesis
[49:35] will you see the fall then you see that
[49:37] Noah and you see him cleansing the earth
[49:40] and you see Abram in watching Abraham's
[49:44] walking around on the cleansed earth
[49:47] right
[49:48] he says everywhere you put you foot I'm
[49:51] gonna give it to you
[49:55] redemption is in process back that I'll
[50:01] make my covenant between me and D and I
[50:06] will multiply the exceedingly you don't
[50:12] have any children at all yet he starts
[50:16] talking about he's gonna give him this
[50:19] seed he shows him it's the Prophet said
[50:24] it's unconditional
[50:25] said he put him to sleep took him
[50:28] totally out of the picture and then made
[50:32] the covenant the Covenant to show what
[50:38] he's gonna do
[50:40] are you listening to a point I'm trying
[50:43] to make see Noah starts off about an
[50:47] earth in a cleansing then God puts a
[50:52] rainbow in the sky he need to held April
[51:00] look to the sky your children to be like
[51:08] the stars in the sky is he speaking of
[51:13] salvation then it comes on through Noah
[51:16] comes into Abram and Abram he starts
[51:21] talking about his seed and about a child
[51:25] he wouldn't talk about children he was
[51:28] talking about a child that was to be
[51:29] born a promised child that would come
[51:33] from the covenant and that child would
[51:37] be Isaac in check your Bible I'll get it
[51:39] in here somewhere
[51:40] but he even makes takes the conent was
[51:42] with Abraham or Abram he transfers and
[51:45] said Isaac will have this true in his
[51:48] shall be for an endless one because it's
[51:51] the promise I'll establish my covenant
[51:55] with thee and thy seed after thee in
[52:00] their generation for an everlasting
[52:03] covenant ain't mentioned do's and don'ts
[52:09] because it was not made on condition I
[52:14] won't get to that today because they
[52:17] take too long we'd be here to five
[52:19] o'clock I'm I'm joking me we've take up
[52:22] the Lord willing and the next message is
[52:24] on the unconditional covenant because
[52:28] remember you're gonna try to talk about
[52:31] an unconditional covenant you better lay
[52:33] it in the right order you mean you can
[52:36] live like the devil and still die and go
[52:38] to heaven well if it's an unconditional
[52:42] covenant the way we think about
[52:44] unconditional that's just the point to
[52:46] lay in for you to think about what I
[52:49] found it what is that unconditional
[52:51] covenants
[52:56] then something happens with Abram I said
[53:01] these little keys would go along that's
[53:03] what I want you to thank him he would
[53:06] Noah and he's doing with the earth and
[53:08] the thing all at once he points him to a
[53:11] rainbow sends him up into the skies okay
[53:18] what happens with April happen with
[53:24] Abram Abram gets a little closer to a
[53:31] happening because God tells Abram not
[53:38] Abraham II ain't got to him yet he ain't
[53:40] changed his name yet that's the next
[53:42] stage this is where we got to Sunday
[53:45] Wednesday
[53:47] he said Abram you circumcised never
[53:53] Michael there's your covenant your
[53:58] covenant
[53:59] I'll make with thee this is my covenant
[54:01] which we you shall keep between me and
[54:04] you and that's ever met ever man child
[54:06] among you shall be circumcised Genesis
[54:09] 17 and verse 10 why does it follow the
[54:16] circumcision
[54:23] because that's his covenant he told you
[54:27] in Genesis he told you and they first
[54:32] started that's the seed of the woman
[54:35] who's going to come forward the seed of
[54:40] the woman is Jesus Christ circumcision
[54:45] at the top of the baptism of the Holy
[54:46] Ghost now you've got no whole
[54:51] justification Abram starting a cleansing
[54:55] and getting everything in the right
[54:58] order and then he starts talking about
[55:02] circumcision why did he go to
[55:08] circumcision why did he go to
[55:14] circumcision they ended with that
[55:16] thought why did God come up and pick up
[55:20] and bring circumcision into view now you
[55:30] tell me you can't see the seed of the
[55:32] serpent then you're blind now you tell
[55:36] me you can't see the message about the
[55:39] seed of the serpent and what happened
[55:42] you're blind
[55:44] God remember that beast and Eve whatever
[55:50] you want to talk about you gonna come no
[55:53] other way because now you're coming all
[55:55] the way over to Abraham and Abraham says
[55:58] circumcise all they might remember sorry
[56:02] you don't circumcise females circumcise
[56:06] the male becomes Dara was where the
[56:10] beginning started with sin come on you
[56:17] tell me what happened in the garden I'll
[56:20] ask you why God said Abraham circumcised
[56:22] all them children because that's my
[56:25] covenant he calls it a covenant I make
[56:28] with thee this is my covenant which he
[56:32] shall keep between me and you and thy
[56:35] seed after thee
[56:36] every man child among you shall be
[56:39] circumcised Genesis 17 and 1011 said in
[56:44] you sell circumcise the flesh of your
[56:47] foreskin and it shall be a token of the
[56:51] Covenant between me and you a token
[56:58] token is a price paid and showing you
[57:02] got hold it in you with in your hand see
[57:05] to Abraham now to Abram he said Abram we
[57:12] got to do a little something here to
[57:14] pick up a part about just about
[57:16] redemption Noah cleanse your body but it
[57:28] left a little bit of hanging can
[57:31] remember justification don't always work
[57:32] too good on everything then you argued
[57:36] that one is you now justification you
[57:39] can follow away from me but he said all
[57:42] right now you take circumcision in place
[57:47] that within it getting closer to the
[57:49] original or the real top that would come
[57:53] of the new birth god I thought we
[57:56] believed in the sink of it in the
[57:58] circumcision of the heart not the
[58:00] circumcision
[58:01] with a natural flesh today that's fine
[58:04] it's done people are doing it all of our
[58:06] kids were everybody basically does is
[58:08] they don't have to but it's not
[58:11] something to make them a Jew it's just a
[58:14] cleansing because they did find out that
[58:17] there was a lot of impurities the
[58:19] problems are so that's the reason they
[58:21] used the natural circumcision all right
[58:24] but the spiritual circumcision is the
[58:27] serf concision of the heart brother
[58:30] Louisa down in the butt in the
[58:32] sunday-school talking about it
[58:35] circumcising cutting off the foreskin
[58:38] are getting it close in sanctification a
[58:42] cleansing
[58:48] what's the next thing that happens after
[58:50] Abram gets a cleansing let's see if I
[59:02] can pick it up we know what it was he
[59:08] wound up getting a name change right
[59:12] Abraham got a name change
[59:15] I thought your prophet said true
[59:21] born-again Christians have a name shine
[59:24] now we're getting something to come over
[59:26] to new testament with pretty good we
[59:28] come over justification we can come over
[59:31] sanctification we can come over with a
[59:33] night change he said we've all had a
[59:37] nine times he said our name now as
[59:39] Christians he said there'll be a new
[59:45] name thing
[59:48] and what are you talking about brother
[59:50] Dale trying to show salvation spoke off
[59:58] taking everything and put it in the
[1:00:00] right order if you don't get it in the
[1:00:01] right order what are you gonna do with
[1:00:07] you see because in that Old Testament
[1:00:09] people outside of Adam and Eve and they
[1:00:14] were the first in creation the way God
[1:00:16] made them from then on down nobody had
[1:00:19] eternal life shorten short term in the
[1:00:27] Prophet Smith you can't even Shama come
[1:00:29] plain language you can't even show me Oh
[1:00:34] without the Prophet you can't show me
[1:00:38] that Adam had eternal life in his soul
[1:00:41] they just simply said he breathed into
[1:00:43] his nostrils become a living soul like I
[1:00:47] said about Abraham Abraham I'm gonna put
[1:00:50] you through this I'm going to show you
[1:00:52] these things I said nobody else ain't
[1:00:54] gonna be able to figure it out but said
[1:00:57] you're a prophet and you'll know what
[1:00:59] these things mean
[1:01:01] your prophet knew what those things
[1:01:04] spoke up and so marvelous we hear him in
[1:01:07] the early years when I first started
[1:01:09] listening the year of Abraham walking
[1:01:12] and the things he was doing and all like
[1:01:15] that it made the Bible just come alive I
[1:01:17] had read the Bible I knew this I knew he
[1:01:20] was Abram and I knew that he didn't have
[1:01:22] no children I knew you wouldn't Abraham
[1:01:24] until way later we read the Bible with
[1:01:29] the marvelous thing was the Prophet
[1:01:31] taking that and bringing it down to our
[1:01:33] day and to see we've got to come through
[1:01:39] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:01:42] was I want to go give me a few more
[1:01:43] minutes we told him he said now listen
[1:01:50] and what to change your name which is a
[1:01:54] rose name I love to read Darin Genesis
[1:01:59] or how many times that Abram met God
[1:02:04] before his name was changed to a Brian
[1:02:06] read it he met him a lot of times that
[1:02:10] his name was Abram which meant
[1:02:13] highfather they're doing pretty good
[1:02:15] with that we didn't are no children but
[1:02:19] then he wound up with a child and they
[1:02:21] said to your father of Nations but that
[1:02:23] wouldn't what he's looking for when he
[1:02:25] was looking for was Isaac the promised
[1:02:28] son to come the word that it would be
[1:02:30] into that doing and Isaac would even be
[1:02:32] incorporated as I said into the
[1:02:34] scripture that speaks of Isaac coming
[1:02:38] forth and said he'll be in a covenant -
[1:02:43] he changed the name of Abram to Abraham
[1:02:48] but around says gave him part of his own
[1:02:51] name join him the covenant is now
[1:02:58] brought down here stands a man on earth
[1:03:03] that God could use to bring a physical
[1:03:08] son of a Brian
[1:03:12] which would type the coming of Jesus
[1:03:14] Christ are you in cause listen he got a
[1:03:21] name changed once he got his name
[1:03:25] changed it went but one more thing this
[1:03:35] is what I like he got a name changed he
[1:03:43] got a body change
[1:03:45] he's running a room was changed to young
[1:03:53] man a young woman now if you don't think
[1:03:55] he was then you got a 87 year old man
[1:03:58] trying to not hear 100 year old man
[1:04:01] trying to father children by 90 year old
[1:04:04] woman oh they live longer back then yeah
[1:04:07] now they doesn't come to the curse of
[1:04:09] 120 years read you Bible the cursed
[1:04:12] falls on mankind about to where it comes
[1:04:15] with the building of the Tower of Babel
[1:04:17] somewhere in there or the flood he falls
[1:04:19] to 120 years you know how that five
[1:04:23] hundred a hundred years all right but
[1:04:26] listen in there old grandma 90 years old
[1:04:31] going down through there and that King
[1:04:34] that could have any woman he wanted and
[1:04:37] he picks out Sarah and wants to marry
[1:04:40] her and I don't approve there's
[1:04:44] something happened to Abraham and Sarah
[1:04:45] and the Bible says they were well
[1:04:49] stricken in years but listen they got a
[1:04:55] change of the body before they could
[1:05:00] produce the promised son they didn't
[1:05:05] need to change the body with a small
[1:05:11] head held a name to the body to fall for
[1:05:15] Isaac could come into being made them a
[1:05:19] young man and young woman when own
[1:05:22] neighbor Ham had about 40 and when I was
[1:05:24] six six kids
[1:05:26] six or seven kids after school
[1:05:30] well what you see church what I'm
[1:05:35] getting at circumcision at the top of
[1:05:38] the Holy Ghost then you come to a name
[1:05:42] change as a Christian receive eternal
[1:05:47] life right your body is still not
[1:05:55] redeemed your body today is in the
[1:06:00] process it's not redeemed it's getting
[1:06:02] older it was redeemed in Christ when
[1:06:07] Christ took down the River Jordan he
[1:06:10] said in this is my son and who I'm
[1:06:12] pleased to dwell the prophet of God made
[1:06:14] it better to understand it he says this
[1:06:16] is my part of the earth ivory game and
[1:06:19] said from this part here I'll redeem
[1:06:21] your bodies because that was literally
[1:06:22] what happened without Jesus Christ
[1:06:24] coming the way he came we couldn't have
[1:06:27] no hopes of a body and that's why your
[1:06:33] basics now listen and I'm not against
[1:06:35] them it's nobody's I'm here preaching
[1:06:37] the basics of the people of organized
[1:06:41] religion believe you're going to get a
[1:06:42] new body not high for the people of this
[1:06:48] message lay the same thing they don't
[1:06:54] believe in a bodily Redemption you say
[1:06:56] how do you know go ask them the best way
[1:06:59] to say it
[1:06:59] listen a little bit you listen to
[1:07:05] somebody one time I'm gonna get a new
[1:07:07] body
[1:07:08] next time he said not this body renewed
[1:07:10] and you don't know what they believe you
[1:07:15] actually said what that brother say I
[1:07:16] said he said he gonna get a new body and
[1:07:18] he said but he he wouldn't go get
[1:07:20] anybody
[1:07:21] so he's confused or I am one you know we
[1:07:26] listen
[1:07:28] what about Abraham and Sarah they could
[1:07:33] not had they had Ashville from Hagar
[1:07:38] and a broom but he gets his name changed
[1:07:43] because all things happens to him he
[1:07:47] gets circumcision because let's see when
[1:07:49] it explodes it was 13 years old when he
[1:07:54] was circumcised Abraham had to be
[1:07:58] circumcised too and he was in his 80s
[1:08:03] everybody had to be circumcised right so
[1:08:07] that was the promise that was the
[1:08:09] Covenant that was showing you the
[1:08:11] cleansing listen the cleansing of what
[1:08:14] it started from I hate to be vulgar it
[1:08:19] started from the niceness to physical
[1:08:24] cleansing to make ready the word you'd
[1:08:29] have any type and that still wouldn't be
[1:08:32] enough so he changed his name he changed
[1:08:38] his name that could top the baptism with
[1:08:42] the Holy Ghost but he doesn't finish the
[1:08:44] story because you see the baptism of the
[1:08:47] Holy Ghost the new birth is not the
[1:08:50] finish of your story it's just the
[1:08:52] beginning the new birth is just the
[1:08:56] beginning he's not to finish then the
[1:09:00] Bible says being born again then we can
[1:09:05] go back and listen to the Prophet talk
[1:09:07] about what all these time flush he's
[1:09:12] over in the future home and he goes back
[1:09:15] and picks up justification
[1:09:18] sanctification the baptism when the Holy
[1:09:21] Ghost
[1:09:25] he says they still something got to
[1:09:27] happen future home I believe it 49 I'm
[1:09:31] not certain look for Tina he said your
[1:09:35] soul is redeemed said your body's not
[1:09:36] redeemed yet our body's not fully
[1:09:40] redeemed yet it was paid for at Calvary
[1:09:43] yes Jesus Christ paid for it all amen
[1:09:46] but it ain't been applied we're still
[1:09:48] getting older
[1:09:50] somebody is going to som were find out
[1:09:53] something in to me is to find out the
[1:09:56] whole Bible tells you what it is its
[1:09:59] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:10:04] of the Holy Ghost and then there's got
[1:10:05] to be a change of the body because Paul
[1:10:08] picks it up in the scriptures and said
[1:10:11] you have to have a change now not an
[1:10:15] exchange not working this and over don't
[1:10:19] have to be my new coat I want you to
[1:10:21] listen me I know sure I know what a lot
[1:10:25] of people think about me
[1:10:26] they think I'm a sarcastic arrogant kind
[1:10:29] of a guy that likes to show everybody
[1:10:31] how much he knows but one of these days
[1:10:35] you'll find out that ain't right you'll
[1:10:39] find out it ain't right so I don't have
[1:10:42] to worry about it you'll learn for
[1:10:45] yourself you'll say that guy was doing
[1:10:47] everything he could to try to preach
[1:10:49] salvation but 47 years I've been trying
[1:10:52] to trying to get meeting you to realize
[1:10:55] who we are what's going on
[1:10:58] now listen what's your profit covers
[1:11:00] with Abraham and Sarah so we'll pull
[1:11:02] this up go ahead brother Joe if you
[1:11:05] would jump over to 14 I know going
[1:11:06] jumping hurry but I've got some quotes
[1:11:08] from the Prophet don't want to read and
[1:11:11] just think about it
[1:11:15] Adam lost it
[1:11:17] Noah starts to plan a Redemption Abraham
[1:11:20] falls in line coming back to greater
[1:11:22] things and he goes from circumcisions he
[1:11:25] goes from knowing the Stars he starts
[1:11:28] picking up all the time in that quote
[1:11:30] let's see if brother Branham was trying
[1:11:32] to hang out the other day where he said
[1:11:33] from the shores to the star he said the
[1:11:37] resurrection the resurrection come in
[1:11:42] you see Church we got to have a
[1:11:44] resurrection for we now have a giant you
[1:11:46] know there's gonna be a resurrection
[1:11:47] before these bodies were changed they
[1:11:52] didn't cross your eyes first listen
[1:11:55] what's your prophet say isn't it of the
[1:11:57] macy's getting in the spirit he's
[1:12:00] brought you in order to receive the
[1:12:01] promised son so you know he's change the
[1:12:03] body
[1:12:03] failure in Abraham next after that
[1:12:06] message in order to receive the promised
[1:12:07] son and that's what he's done this
[1:12:09] church wrote it through the same thing
[1:12:14] the next thing is exchanged in a moment
[1:12:17] in the twinkling of an eye and going and
[1:12:20] will have to have a changed body now
[1:12:24] listen now Sarah and Abraham in that
[1:12:27] kind of a body could not receive the
[1:12:29] promised son Martin do you know what
[1:12:33] that means I Abraham and Sarah and their
[1:12:35] natural bodies they had to have exchange
[1:12:37] of the body to have the promised son ok
[1:12:39] watch they were a hundred years old
[1:12:43] he had to change their body what's not
[1:12:46] turned them back so much as too young
[1:12:50] which he did but also changed them
[1:12:58] because they'd been like they was all at
[1:13:02] the first plane no one following him
[1:13:06] Abraham and Sarah was young man a young
[1:13:08] woman at the first place they had the
[1:13:11] abilities for bringing forth right first
[1:13:13] place and it couldn't bring it in the
[1:13:15] first place so now you get what he's
[1:13:17] saying not turning back so much as young
[1:13:22] which he did but he also changed them
[1:13:29] because they'd been like they was at the
[1:13:32] first place but he changed their body in
[1:13:34] such a way that they could receive the
[1:13:36] son and now we find the next thing in
[1:13:39] order for the church is a changed body
[1:13:47] what's not as old people go back and be
[1:13:52] young so much that's what everybody
[1:13:55] thinks changes changing back to young
[1:13:57] man to young woman
[1:13:58] no it's to make eternal change you back
[1:14:03] to young man a young woman ain't worth
[1:14:04] nothing
[1:14:04] you're gonna die again it makes eternal
[1:14:09] are you following me the change makes
[1:14:14] eternal not makes you young
[1:14:17] come on notice old people go back to be
[1:14:21] young so much but we will and will be
[1:14:24] they're young just a certain but we've
[1:14:26] got to have a change body in order to
[1:14:28] receive the Sun because we're going to
[1:14:31] meet him in the air rapture will come a
[1:14:37] change in a moment in a twinkling of an
[1:14:40] eye not to just make you young again
[1:14:48] change this body to make it eternal come
[1:14:52] on next an excellent show vajura
[1:14:57] remember it's a promise
[1:15:00] royal seed immediately come in yes we'll
[1:15:05] be changed
[1:15:06] they were changed back to a young man
[1:15:08] and young woman just showing exactly
[1:15:10] what the church the role your seed is
[1:15:13] going to be done you say is that a
[1:15:16] promise first that's the only is 4:17
[1:15:19] determined regard to the sound be
[1:15:20] changed at the moment we cannot be
[1:15:22] caught up together why her body their
[1:15:24] bodies had to be changed to receive the
[1:15:26] Sun now they had to be physically made
[1:15:30] young they were not made eternal now
[1:15:34] don't follow that line Abraham and Sarah
[1:15:37] wasn't made eternal they were made young
[1:15:40] we have to be made eternal because if
[1:15:46] not he just put us right back where they
[1:15:48] were
[1:15:49] what's it hold up why her body their
[1:15:54] bodies had to be changed and receive the
[1:15:55] Sun and our mortal of our bodies will
[1:15:58] have to be changed to receive the Sun
[1:16:00] cause we'll be caught up we'll have to
[1:16:05] be a different body from this now are
[1:16:14] you falling it will have to be a
[1:16:18] different body from there if you made
[1:16:20] this young what God would it do it be
[1:16:24] this body made young is that all you
[1:16:27] know about a change
[1:16:31] the change that I've always taught that
[1:16:34] comes in that way is an eternal body
[1:16:36] Abraham and Sarah didn't get an eternal
[1:16:39] body they both died we're going back to
[1:16:45] the garden where Adam lost that part
[1:16:48] what did he lose he lost the body
[1:16:52] he lost the earth no I started to
[1:16:56] cleansing Jesus Christ in the
[1:16:58] sanctification will have to be a
[1:17:05] different body from this in other words
[1:17:09] evidently pointing at it but we'll be
[1:17:11] caught up in the air to meet him Bible
[1:17:14] says we'll have a glorious body like
[1:17:15] honey is okay just right with her
[1:17:19] scripture you see they were changed if
[1:17:21] we ever meet the Lord in the air we
[1:17:24] can't meet him with this kind of a body
[1:17:26] cuz were earthbound but we're going to
[1:17:30] receive one hallelujah that'll go up in
[1:17:33] the rapture not a new body this body
[1:17:39] made new one game people say that then
[1:17:43] where did I say like I said wanna go you
[1:17:45] say Leo person say one time I'm gonna
[1:17:47] get a new body in the other knee turn
[1:17:49] back around little bit so it's body my
[1:17:52] new why don't you put it all together at
[1:17:53] one time and they say it it's not a new
[1:17:57] body it's dead body maybe eternal does
[1:18:02] this body come out of the earth and one
[1:18:05] day according to the future own this
[1:18:06] earth going to be made eternal no we
[1:18:10] with the Prophet see Abraham and Sarah
[1:18:17] had to be turned back to produce the
[1:18:21] promised son you and I are not going to
[1:18:24] produce the promise we're gonna produce
[1:18:26] the promised son and then be turned back
[1:18:29] cuz we gonna meet him in the air we
[1:18:31] ain't got to produce him we just got to
[1:18:34] go meeting in the air one day because
[1:18:40] he's made away okay look the next
[1:18:43] Easter notice all the reading now you
[1:18:47] come down through the placing of the Sun
[1:18:49] justification Abraham and his group next
[1:18:52] thing was the gun was a change and we
[1:18:54] don't seen everything through jest okay
[1:18:56] same case in the baptismal Togo placing
[1:18:58] the sun's signs and wonders of him being
[1:19:01] his presidency discern the thoughts as I
[1:19:03] as it was in the days of Sodom so she
[1:19:05] ought to be they come in the Son of Man
[1:19:07] what was the next the change of the body
[1:19:12] what's the next time - you and I we've
[1:19:16] done come through justification same
[1:19:17] case the baptism with all the colors the
[1:19:23] change of the body I show that this we
[1:19:26] are looking for an expected son than
[1:19:30] what you glory is that right we cannot
[1:19:34] meet him in these bodies if we are
[1:19:39] changed back to young men and women
[1:19:41] still we can't meet him because we have
[1:19:45] to meet him in the air so to prove where
[1:19:49] it goes to work there has to be
[1:19:51] something done besides change us back to
[1:19:54] a young man and woman we've got to be
[1:19:56] changed and caught up in the air to meet
[1:19:59] him and the next thing coming is the
[1:20:01] rapture to the church in the change of
[1:20:04] the body so we've been science to meet
[1:20:06] the Lord Jesus in the air is that enough
[1:20:11] not enough to show you justification
[1:20:16] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:20:19] Ghost
[1:20:19] it's all topped out in the Old Testament
[1:20:22] showing exactly more we've posted wind
[1:20:26] up you can spend years preaching out of
[1:20:29] that I remember when I first come into
[1:20:32] message I used to preach in the the
[1:20:35] travel of Israel enjoy death in their
[1:20:38] journey and how they'd go this way and
[1:20:41] they'd go right away and then you'd see
[1:20:45] them come up with names Dan Ephraim's
[1:20:47] and all of that and you see God placing
[1:20:50] them right in order and how they line up
[1:20:52] and they go out and how they get started
[1:20:54] they do this
[1:20:55] I love that a whole Testament because
[1:20:58] you know what without the Old Testament
[1:21:00] and understanding it right you think you
[1:21:02] understand the New Testament oh yes we
[1:21:06] will
[1:21:06] oh no you won't because you don't have
[1:21:10] enough foundation the Old Testament
[1:21:14] stops and shatters of the New Testament
[1:21:17] to come are you following me all back
[1:21:24] there trying it with Abraham and Sabra
[1:21:26] turn back to a young man a young woman
[1:21:29] top in the rapture top in the change as
[1:21:36] we call it and leaving off of this earth
[1:21:38] Oh back down but you think that Old
[1:21:43] Testament water or I don't never getting
[1:21:46] that out of reading the Old Testament it
[1:21:48] is you know it's just much of rules
[1:21:49] regulations that ain't what it is it
[1:21:55] ain't what it is then brother Branham
[1:21:58] would take the Ten Commandments and make
[1:22:01] it the seals I don't think it's a bunch
[1:22:07] of rules and regulation I don't come on
[1:22:12] brothers I thought was supposed to be
[1:22:15] either where the Prophet said if you
[1:22:17] don't see Christ in ever verse of the
[1:22:23] Bible he said go back and read it again
[1:22:29] Christ throughout the Old Testament as
[1:22:34] well as the new topped out in the three
[1:22:42] things that the Prophet said there's
[1:22:44] three covenants made he said to him was
[1:22:48] made own condition he said but at to
[1:22:55] Abraham it was unconditional now we're
[1:23:02] gonna get into a little bit there cause
[1:23:03] like I said the way our thinking of our
[1:23:07] mind is
[1:23:08] we ate off the tree of knowledge so long
[1:23:12] until the thinking of our mind is an
[1:23:15] unconditional covenant means there ain't
[1:23:18] no way they could be any do's and don'ts
[1:23:25] what I want you to answer one scripture
[1:23:29] one not a whole Bible what why does it
[1:23:34] mention in the New Testament talking
[1:23:36] about Christians now talking about the
[1:23:39] world the Bible is not written to the
[1:23:43] sinner it's written to Christians why
[1:23:46] does it say you're gonna have to give an
[1:23:49] account of the deeds done in the body
[1:23:52] whether good or bad yeah but that ain't
[1:23:57] to me
[1:23:57] you just ate off the tree but your bite
[1:24:01] went to wrong you went to the tree of
[1:24:04] knowledge he just snapped down real good
[1:24:06] but it'll vomit your body out of you
[1:24:09] because it'll not work see you can't
[1:24:18] just be like if we thought us Baptists
[1:24:21] we told it once saved always say well I
[1:24:26] didn't agree with it then I didn't
[1:24:32] because I saw too many things in there
[1:24:35] they didn't look like that I thought it
[1:24:37] was supposed to be a Christian life
[1:24:42] believe it right turn is it
[1:24:46] unconditional they don't make no
[1:24:48] difference what I do I'm going to have
[1:24:49] them anyway you say that that's not
[1:24:56] that's not a Christian talking that's
[1:24:59] the devil talking
