[11:40] good to be a house of the Lord
[11:42] join that good music and good stuff
[11:45] there brother Louise got that velvet
[11:47] jacket on and getting some blue suede
[11:50] shoes and that fella had to brother
[11:57] that's right good to have these young
[11:59] ones coming along and helping us all out
[12:02] got I was talking to a Methodist
[12:07] preacher the other day neighbor friend
[12:11] of ours and he said we're losing
[12:14] ministers like crazy we can't get
[12:17] anybody to come and then dad's brother
[12:23] he's 80 1 or 2 and he's trying to retire
[12:29] they won't let him because there's just
[12:31] not that many good preachers around I
[12:33] said well come on up to Lowell I said
[12:36] well we got 4 or 5 pretty decent ones
[12:39] and I said we we don't have a shortage
[12:41] of them up there maybe you could come up
[12:43] there and maybe learn a little bit so I
[12:46] did get in a good discussion with the
[12:48] Methodists about about the once saved
[12:52] always saved course they was too bad
[12:53] that's there and they left first because
[12:58] the Methodist preacher did he you know
[12:59] he was he's a real nice guy
[13:02] since we've been boys our neighbor and
[13:04] he said I have a problem with that
[13:07] somebody you know like you've always
[13:09] heard that you know if you get saved at
[13:11] 9 years old your name gets put on the
[13:12] book and Baptist Church once saved
[13:14] always saved you can go live like the
[13:16] devil but when it comes to the end you
[13:19] know it's like daddy said you paid the
[13:20] parking lot or you know kiss the kids or
[13:22] something you go to heaven there that's
[13:23] not it
[13:24] we know that we know it's a process and
[13:27] I told Phil I said I said you know your
[13:30] your founding father there John Wesley I
[13:34] said he was pretty staunch on living
[13:37] right and he said yeah he said we've got
[13:40] away from that so maybe we see a stir
[13:43] and in in the people and I'm not I'm not
[13:47] being inclusive or exclusive today but
[13:51] still we have to know one thing's for
[13:53] sure Jesus said there's one way one
[13:57] truth and one life there's not two or
[14:00] three different ideas they're not four
[14:02] or five I was telling this morning I'll
[14:04] give you a little this one was fresh for
[14:06] me because I've been thinking about it
[14:07] and told them downstairs I was thinking
[14:11] I saw somebody's name the other day and
[14:13] her name was like Carol
[14:17] Addison Dale you know how they - ate
[14:20] their last name they keep part of their
[14:22] last name they hang on to that no we
[14:25] don't hang on to that and I said well
[14:28] that's what the Baptist and the
[14:29] Methodist and Pentecostals done a magic
[14:32] book of Revelation says you've got a
[14:33] name that you live by yet you're dead
[14:36] right but when june thomas married Wade
[14:39] dale me and my wife she's not a commis
[14:43] anymore
[14:43] she became a full-fledged ale a ma'am so
[14:47] if you put a hyphenation in there that's
[14:49] what the denominations have done they
[14:50] put that hyphenation it's Jesus Christ
[14:52] slash Baptist that's not right it's
[14:56] either the bride of Jesus Christ or
[14:58] you're not one of the - Jesus Christ
[15:00] does not have four or five wives he has
[15:04] one wife and that's the bride of Jesus
[15:06] Christ standing here today in front of
[15:08] me so let's get our Bibles out and turn
[15:10] to we'll start with the book of James
[15:11] we're still on the on the fall this will
[15:15] be the fall
[15:15] part four and we'll subtitle it to
[15:19] spirits
[15:20] all right to spirits the Dale was
[15:26] hitting a little bit on it this morning
[15:27] so maybe we can continue on I like to
[15:32] let the way the Lord works like that
[15:33] because I don't try to steal his fire
[15:35] and he don't steal mine and we don't
[15:37] still Jose and anybody else wants to
[15:39] talk about the Word of God it just kind
[15:41] of all falls into continuity was no like
[15:43] brother Bob Wednesday night that was a
[15:45] good job best I believe he's ever done
[15:47] and in which you should be that way so
[15:49] let's turn to James one we read this
[15:52] last week and we're going to back up
[15:54] just a little bit and you know we're
[15:57] still talking about the fall go to the
[15:59] book of James 1 verse 14 all right let's
[16:04] bow our heads before we get started
[16:05] definitely father we pray today Lord
[16:07] that you'll be on the scene father we
[16:10] know you're here we now pray that will
[16:13] clean us all out
[16:15] you take over be the active participant
[16:17] in in the service you'll be the speaker
[16:20] you be the hear you be the one that
[16:22] reveals because you're the only one that
[16:23] can give revelation probably pray this
[16:26] you'd be with the ones that are not here
[16:27] the ones that are sick the ones that are
[16:30] sins take father standing here Lord in
[16:33] the pulpit I always remember right below
[16:34] my feet is a list of names that we're
[16:36] praying Lord that will come to you
[16:38] father my children included and a lot of
[16:40] the ones here in the sanctuary fathers
[16:43] and mothers and all included Lord we
[16:45] pray that that you will hear our cry and
[16:48] hear our plea for our lost loved ones
[16:50] with the our getting short we have a I
[16:54] believe the bride has an agenda we have
[16:57] an agenda to get the people ready for
[17:00] for the resurrection and then a change
[17:03] of the body and not to be playing around
[17:06] but to get right with what's going on
[17:09] father we played around long enough and
[17:11] all these different ideas and thoughts
[17:13] but I know that there's one truth one
[17:16] life one Holy Spirit and one true
[17:19] revelation and father we're trying our
[17:21] best along with all the others here all
[17:23] the support we get from the congregation
[17:26] that we know that you're here
[17:29] to do the work we pray that we'll just
[17:31] now all yield ourselves to You Father
[17:33] you'd be the one that does the work be
[17:35] with the missionaries on the foreign
[17:37] fields give them fruit for their labor
[17:39] be with the ones Lord dinner that are
[17:42] coming in Lord in the next couple of
[17:43] months just be with them and take care
[17:45] of them Father forgive us of our sins
[17:47] bless us in Jesus name Amen
[17:50] James 1 verse 14 says but every man is
[17:53] tempted when he is drawn away of his own
[17:55] lust and enticed that when the lust hath
[17:58] conceived there are four parts of this
[18:00] when lust has conceived it brings forth
[18:03] what sin and when sin when it is
[18:07] finished it bringeth forth death which
[18:12] is the four things that we're looking at
[18:13] so you may be seizing the Lord adders
[18:15] blessing to the reading the word now I
[18:17] didn't bring any more scriptures because
[18:19] I'm just going to background a little
[18:21] bit what we've been talking about we
[18:22] know for a fact like we were talking
[18:24] about last Sunday that the fall was not
[18:27] caused by the eating of an apple or the
[18:28] eating of a fruit hey man if not then we
[18:32] just need to start eating apples again
[18:33] to get us back to what we supposed to be
[18:35] right but the Bible says that you're the
[18:38] fruit of your mother you're the fruit of
[18:40] the womb of your mother right you are
[18:42] the production off the tree of your
[18:44] mother and your father so we ought to
[18:46] see now that when Moses penned this he
[18:49] wasn't looking at Eve standing under an
[18:51] apple tree mmm he said the God told him
[18:56] said don't you partake of that tree in
[19:00] the garden no ma'am and then we had the
[19:03] serpent come in which we know for a fact
[19:05] tonight I know there's ones that are
[19:07] that are new here i Sterling's
[19:10] girlfriend has got it down pat if she
[19:13] wants to see sterling she got come
[19:14] Church it's good to have her with us
[19:18] again today you're not a banister
[19:20] anymore I'm going to quit talking about
[19:21] your promise in about December of next
[19:23] year but good to have you with us but
[19:26] sometimes you know when people come in
[19:28] we have a brother here you know that's
[19:29] just come in and sometimes we talk about
[19:32] things and you and I you know been in
[19:34] the message 3040 years we've we've had
[19:36] an understanding of what went on in the
[19:38] fall and the world has been
[19:43] I guess the world has been taught that
[19:47] Eve eat an apple which caused the fall
[19:49] of mankind well we know that's not true
[19:51] that it was actually an act between the
[19:54] we were talking about last Sunday you
[19:56] see that in creative evolution now not
[19:59] in Darwin's evolution but in creative
[20:02] evolution how God created this one in
[20:04] this one and the fish of the sea and the
[20:06] fowl of the air and the cattle come up
[20:08] to the monkey and then there's always
[20:10] been that missing link you've studied it
[20:13] in school there's a missing link there
[20:15] man knows that man knows that the
[20:18] chimpanzee can't coincide with a with a
[20:21] female woman human and that we can't
[20:24] coincide with them you don't know what
[20:26] I'm talking about
[20:26] reproduce because of that missing link
[20:29] there's a gap in there all right so we
[20:32] know that the Bible says the serpent was
[20:34] the most subtool of all beasts and even
[20:36] Scofield to tell you that that beast was
[20:39] not a snake it was turned into a snake
[20:41] it was an upright creature the person
[20:45] that stands between to what the the
[20:47] monkey which is a higher form of
[20:49] evolution the monkey and the man stood
[20:51] something called a beast we know that's
[20:53] what the Bible says and then the Bible
[20:55] says he was more subtil which what he
[20:57] would he was able to speak to the human
[21:01] race and able to also speak to the
[21:05] animal kingdom all right so that was
[21:06] that gap in between uh that man's always
[21:08] been looking for if they'd read the
[21:09] Bible that's it
[21:10] and how Satan entered that beast and
[21:13] vicariously through that beast since
[21:15] Satan is not a creator amen same can't
[21:19] create he's a spiritual being but he
[21:22] cannot create God is the only creator
[21:24] there is thank God for that that we can
[21:27] rest that one person has control of the
[21:30] creation now what the Satan do he
[21:32] perverts what God's already brought you
[21:34] and then so he perverted this earth this
[21:37] earth was doing fine without without the
[21:40] devil but once he entered that beast and
[21:42] began to talk to Eve and tell Eve say
[21:45] Eve I know God said multiply and
[21:48] replenish the earth you're falling
[21:50] behind on the program there sister they
[21:53] look at me and mrs. beast and look at
[21:55] the animals look at the dogs
[21:57] the cats they're reproducing God told
[21:59] him to multiply and replenish Eric right
[22:02] hey man so they were multiplying
[22:06] they were there's nothing wrong with
[22:09] that but when you bring it into the
[22:11] human Kingdom where man was not supposed
[22:14] to come that way we were supposed to be
[22:16] spoken-word children hello man that's
[22:20] what happened with Mary Mary what mary
[22:22] did not conceive by sex act she
[22:25] conceived only one way and that was that
[22:28] God created the egg and God I love that
[22:30] word created created the egg and he
[22:32] created the sperm placed it in the womb
[22:35] of Mary she was the incubator it was put
[22:39] into a right environment listen it was
[22:42] put in the right environment an
[22:44] environment and it produced a ma'am so
[22:47] because of the fall when she though gave
[22:51] it to Adam and Adam for took that
[22:54] actually stopped God from doing any of
[22:56] his act a spoken word creation now it
[23:01] had to come by the loins of man sure we
[23:03] know that remember the Bible says that
[23:05] Abraham were the royal seed of Abraham
[23:09] right but not natural seed no no no no
[23:13] listen
[23:15] Abraham is called the father of our
[23:18] faith he lied give his wife away twice
[23:23] twice but yet is a father of our faith
[23:26] why he just kept going he just kept
[23:29] going sure we're going to have time to
[23:31] rely were you quiet but we're going to
[23:37] say God forgive me and we're going to
[23:38] keep on walking that's why Abraham
[23:40] acquired the promise because what he
[23:42] kept walking but the Bible says not
[23:44] seeds as of many but one seed that's at
[23:48] Genesis 1:26 man that one seed which is
[23:51] Christ mmm and it was never been by lust
[23:56] or conception or anything in the loins
[23:58] of a human being God wanted to reproduce
[24:03] by a spoken-- seed Word of God and then
[24:08] he did not want
[24:10] - come this way but by his permissive
[24:12] well the reason we were talking about
[24:14] this morning if you just to be real real
[24:20] adamant about this if we would have come
[24:29] spoken word children had there not been
[24:32] a fall there have been two sets of
[24:35] people there being a bride and God
[24:36] that's it that's it now we know that's
[24:42] good if you're concluded is that but now
[24:46] outside of that then you're lost unless
[24:49] you have something called grace God by
[24:54] his sovereign grace to be a savior to be
[24:57] someone that I tell them I feel we act
[25:00] like God sometimes because we kick them
[25:01] out leave it alone and let God do the
[25:06] work because outside of this now you
[25:09] have a foolish virgin you have a cup of
[25:12] water in my name you have Israel you
[25:14] have all the Old Testament saves thank
[25:16] you buddy amen amen
[25:20] so now look at the expanding of God you
[25:22] say well that was a horrible thing that
[25:24] happened in the garden sure it was
[25:25] horrible it comes all sin grief
[25:27] heartache cancer any kind of disease got
[25:31] started in the book of Genesis ma'am
[25:33] Genesis is the seed shocker we're going
[25:36] to look at in just a minute we ever get
[25:37] to it we're going to look that
[25:39] denomination's was set up in in the
[25:41] garden that Satan was riding right along
[25:43] in that garden with God's children amen
[25:51] got a rights amen but when less have
[25:55] conceived it bringeth forth sin you see
[25:59] how it continues to roll but sin when
[26:02] it's finished listen it's not it's not
[26:04] horrible to sin we were all born in it
[26:08] and then we were born in sin shapen in
[26:12] iniquity responsible my mother's womb a
[26:14] liar come to this earth dead
[26:19] you know what the Bible tells us what to
[26:21] cry at the birth of a child and rejoiced
[26:25] at a saint going home we have it right
[26:27] rivers we go to the hospital me go this
[26:29] sweet little child he's born dead he or
[26:33] she is born dead amen and without the
[26:37] saving grace without that Savior
[26:39] attribute that God now he is able to
[26:43] never had to never had to produce that
[26:45] he'd never had to be a healer he'd never
[26:48] been a savior if there hadn't been a
[26:51] fall he'd never been a healer had he not
[26:54] been a fall
[26:54] and something called grace would have
[26:57] never been in the picture
[26:58] amen listen this plan that God set up is
[27:06] perfect we try to change it we try to
[27:11] say I do it a different way but if God
[27:15] never had a new thought and if God is
[27:17] never wrong then this is exactly the way
[27:20] it was supposed to be man has hyphenated
[27:24] it man has hyphenated it and when saying
[27:29] that they're married to Jesus Christ yes
[27:31] they keep their old name Amen and this
[27:34] ain't got nothing to do what I'm fixing
[27:35] to regional anyway everybody all right
[27:40] yeah
[27:41] everybody okay but we know what happened
[27:44] in the Garden of Eden it was not that it
[27:46] was so much the sex act it was so much
[27:48] that Eve come out from behind the word
[27:51] and began to preach to the serpent she
[27:55] should have went and got her head which
[27:57] is Adam and said Adam I want you to this
[28:00] guy's talking some strange stuff but
[28:02] what did what level remember now Satan
[28:05] smart not an idiot
[28:07] he didn't go start talking to Adam he
[28:10] could he knew that anointing with Adam
[28:12] was so strong he really couldn't get to
[28:14] him but Eve he said I can get to her
[28:18] emotion because that's what it is he can
[28:20] get to her he got to her emotional part
[28:22] and said Eve look God told you to
[28:24] multiply and replenish the earth and
[28:26] you're not doing anything it's just you
[28:27] and Adam you and I
[28:28] you and Adam and she goes hmm maybe I
[28:33] can help him out a little bit well God
[28:36] don't need no help his plan was perfect
[28:40] to start with and this is part of the
[28:43] plan amen
[28:45] everybody all right man so now James
[28:48] says when Lester can see bring forth sin
[28:50] when sin is finished because remember
[28:53] Eve could have had that thought in her
[28:55] mind but instead of cutting it off see
[28:58] what she went to the next part then she
[29:01] went to the next part was held we were
[29:02] all born in sin we're all sinners but
[29:05] when sin is finished it brings forth
[29:08] death now God came down in human flesh
[29:11] to cut that off to destroy the effects
[29:14] of the fall amen all the effects of the
[29:18] fall that's why he's a healer that's why
[29:20] I'll heal you now that's why I'll save
[29:22] you now amen
[29:24] he said well by the way we're getting
[29:26] older it's okay we're doing something
[29:28] about that all right listen
[29:40] Adams natural seed though when he did
[29:45] the act with Eve was not to save her
[29:49] soul or to save her it was more I was
[29:54] trying to explain the other day to Adam
[29:56] listen he knew the principles while Adam
[29:58] Adam was not a dummy remember I don't
[30:01] went into this thing with his eyes wide
[30:02] open he knew what Eve had done he knew
[30:06] that she had done what she done and that
[30:08] she deserved death that sounds kind of
[30:13] like me and you we deserve death but
[30:17] what did Christ do he said no he said
[30:19] I'll take on her sin I will be her
[30:24] protector because she's not only Eve
[30:26] she's me if I got to kill me I'm not
[30:32] going to do it right there's the love
[30:35] that Adam had for Eve not that he had to
[30:39] have some lustful act with her
[30:41] to save her soul no her soul was already
[30:44] okay amen
[30:46] but to continue on listen brother Brahim
[30:49] sin Revelation chapter 5 he said Adam
[30:51] seed absolutely lost everything amen
[30:55] because we're going to read here in just
[30:56] a minute we're when the two boys came
[30:58] out the two spirits the two boys can
[31:00] enable came out they were not sure
[31:04] the Bible says righteous Abel because
[31:06] what he did a right act that's what
[31:09] righteous means is to be right all right
[31:11] he did a right act by killing the lamb
[31:14] and Cain did not accept that so he
[31:18] became the wrong one all right so now
[31:20] let's read here still look it wasn't the
[31:22] Adam or any of his seeds Adam seed
[31:24] absolutely lost everything it's not the
[31:27] seed of Adam no matter how much we try
[31:30] to beautify this world because remember
[31:32] look Adam his eyes were wide open he
[31:36] knew what he was going to do was going
[31:38] to sell us out right he was selling the
[31:43] whole human race out amen that's why the
[31:46] second Adam has to come to bring the
[31:48] human race back out amen the second Adam
[31:52] both eyes open knew what he was coming
[31:56] here for he was coming here to die sure
[32:00] he didn't know it when he was little but
[32:02] he did when he was older he said he even
[32:05] told Pilate he said to this end was I
[32:06] born a man so he knew what he had to do
[32:10] he knew that that first item had failed
[32:13] and that first item he could not what
[32:16] died for the whole human race he was not
[32:20] a creator either so we couldn't create
[32:21] sure they were able by sex to bring
[32:25] forth these children but remember they
[32:28] were still lost they were still they
[32:31] still needed a sacrifice to get by a man
[32:35] even Adam and Eve in verse 21 of chapter
[32:38] 3 says in the item he said to his wife
[32:40] did the Lord make coats of skin so the
[32:43] first animal sacrifice was not able
[32:45] right it was God himself God Himself
[32:49] came down killed the lamb took the skins
[32:51] ripped it off them throw it in the
[32:53] bushes and said here put this on
[32:56] those issues now you're covering a man
[33:00] you know what the word religion means
[33:06] look up the word religion it means a
[33:08] covering man now let's look number two
[33:15] go to number two revelation chapter 5
[33:18] now our kinsmen have handed the seventh
[33:20] sealed book of redemption from the
[33:21] original owner the original owner when
[33:24] we lost it at the Garden of Eden through
[33:26] item it went back to the original owner
[33:29] that's what we were talking about last
[33:30] Sunday right at the end
[33:31] Adam had the ability to bring back
[33:34] Genesis 1:26 forth
[33:36] amen amen
[33:40] prophet of God said that Jesus his body
[33:43] would have come to leave okay alright so
[33:45] that was the first plan but now look God
[33:48] don't have plan a in B and C it was his
[33:51] original plan to start with we just
[33:54] don't know that we didn't know it hey
[33:57] man he knows in from the beginning I
[34:00] tell them this morning I I'm still
[34:01] trying to find that quote but brother
[34:03] Adam says when item did what he did in
[34:05] the garden in other words it darkened
[34:07] from there backwards he didn't forget
[34:10] where he was coming from but there was
[34:13] some things that he couldn't do that he
[34:14] used to could do and then hit some of
[34:18] the power had been taken away from him
[34:19] that all right but now here in the end
[34:23] time when Christ came back in human
[34:25] flesh and said I came from God and I go
[34:28] back to God
[34:29] I believe he's gave us here in the end
[34:33] time he's gave us the ability now to
[34:36] look back all the way back past the
[34:40] Garden of Eden into the mind of God
[34:42] where this book was written before the
[34:44] foundation of the world and know where
[34:46] we come from what we're doing here where
[34:49] we're going in at the prophet of God
[34:50] said what the seal was is what tells you
[34:52] what where you come from what you're
[34:54] doing here and where you're going
[34:56] amen so once we know that see the
[34:58] problem is is man has been lost in all
[35:01] these denominational ideas and even in
[35:04] the message with all these different
[35:06] ideas of well it's a Trinity well let's
[35:08] this well it's a baptism it's another
[35:10] baptism it's a sprinkling it's a pouring
[35:12] it's a Hail Mary it's a it's God that
[35:15] confused God's got one way one truth and
[35:20] one life and when man fell in the Garden
[35:24] of Eden somehow we lost that ability to
[35:28] get back to God because God said I'm
[35:30] going to put enmity God I'm Amanda he
[35:32] said I in other words God said look Adam
[35:34] I can't talk to you anymore because you
[35:36] have sinned you have something that I've
[35:40] got to have something between me and you
[35:42] now and then if it's a blood offering
[35:44] between me and you in the Old Testament
[35:48] it was the blood offering that covered
[35:50] the sin but it still the sin was still
[35:51] there but when Christ come and when he
[35:54] get away with that then now your soul is
[35:57] as perfect as God is it's his perfect
[36:00] his item was right there hello somebody
[36:03] I thought we were the second Eve I
[36:07] thought the second Adam and the second
[36:10] Eve was the second equals nothing will
[36:11] fall and then he's going to take her
[36:15] back to the garden I remember Adam
[36:18] couldn't take Eve back in the garden
[36:20] right Bible says right here that they
[36:23] were driven out they couldn't stand
[36:26] where they used to stand but what are we
[36:28] supposed to do by the Prophet message of
[36:30] the hour told us we're going back to the
[36:32] Garden of Eden amen he said those same
[36:38] flaming swords it was keeping Adam and
[36:40] Eve away from the garden and now what
[36:42] driving the believer back to the Garden
[36:44] of Eden
[36:44] amen all right we lost it in the garden
[36:52] what did we lose we lost the ability to
[36:55] be eternal body spirit and soul right
[36:59] that's what we lost and then you say how
[37:04] you know that you're dying even though
[37:08] you're born again Paul was born again
[37:10] Iranian smarten me you all the one just
[37:14] went on sure their soul is clean their
[37:18] soul is perfect
[37:20] but that sin curse is still attached to
[37:22] your body it's attached to you or living
[37:26] under a curse y'all ought to say amen to
[37:31] that because you know you are every
[37:36] every time I get up I get a new muscles
[37:39] it aches where it wasn't one before and
[37:43] I'm only 57 yeah you just we out need
[37:47] bro college a bird I mean used to how
[37:52] many times you just jump out as soon as
[37:53] you hit the alarm clock you get that
[37:54] alarm clapping brother Larry even me
[37:56] feet on the ground gone no you hit that
[37:59] alarm clock you go beat you got to move
[38:06] and they go no we don't yes we do but no
[38:15] that's part of it but what what is all
[38:17] this part of Redemption that we're
[38:19] talking about this is not some sad story
[38:21] what is the part of Redemption we're
[38:23] talking about God has made a way for us
[38:25] to get back and man remember he didn't
[38:27] come down to give us an inheritance
[38:30] hello
[38:31] he didn't come down here to give us an
[38:33] inheritance we already had an
[38:35] inheritance he just came back he said I
[38:38] am the way the truth and the life I'm
[38:41] the way back to that in Harrison right
[38:43] and then your inheritance was what I've
[38:45] been talking about that Genesis 1:26 man
[38:49] before the foundation of the world that
[38:51] I never had a bad thought never had a
[38:53] bad day never had a bad revelation never
[38:56] had a bad doctrine pure God Almighty is
[39:01] the only one that can do that
[39:02] amen and that's what we're if this is
[39:07] the book of redemption then he's going
[39:09] to redeem back every name that's in that
[39:10] book man that Adam was going to be able
[39:13] to produce had he not taken Eve side if
[39:18] you want to say that but he had to God
[39:21] knew he would there wasn't a crisis
[39:22] meeting in heaven when Adam did what he
[39:24] did come on he knew exactly what was
[39:31] going to happen
[39:34] and I don't say that he was happy in the
[39:37] way we think happy but he was like I
[39:39] knew you'd do that I've already made a
[39:41] way I think he kind of giggles at our
[39:44] age every once in a while because we'll
[39:46] do something we'll think we get by with
[39:48] it before the foundation of the world
[39:51] God knew you're going to do it and man
[39:54] that's kind of God I serve you try to
[39:57] get by with something sneak something by
[40:00] God please people head creep you can't
[40:05] sneak them by the devil you come to
[40:10] church and he's there already waiting on
[40:12] you and when you're not here he sit here
[40:15] waiting on a man but look we lost it in
[40:19] the Garden of Eden listen we didn't lose
[40:24] our inheritance God is not an Indian
[40:26] giver
[40:26] God did not put a name in the book in
[40:29] the Lamb's Book of Life you're what I'm
[40:31] saying the Lamb's Book of Life
[40:33] he didn't put a name in there and then
[40:35] forget about it or erased it out if it's
[40:39] there it was written in blood and when
[40:43] he went to Calvary when he was on the
[40:46] cross the book of name was right there
[40:50] with him
[40:50] hey man it took him three hours to die
[40:54] three hours don't you think how many
[40:58] names went through his brain when he was
[41:01] on the cross I was on his mind he died
[41:04] for me he didn't die for you I'm the
[41:07] only one I know he died for you better
[41:10] think you're the only one that he died
[41:11] for because I know he called my name
[41:13] what about you
[41:15] Amen where's the word Bob black when you
[41:23] need him
[41:24] all right that's Satan he came over he's
[41:28] a poacher now what did Satan do Satan
[41:30] slipped in and began a work that he
[41:34] thinks he's going to be able to take
[41:36] over God's kingdom kind of kind of
[41:43] crazy but I mean how would a man you
[41:46] think being deceived how would a man
[41:48] that that knew that that was my creator
[41:51] and then I'm going to do something to
[41:54] get over him or kill him or destroy him
[41:58] no but he's trying he gets he listen
[42:04] Satan gets an A for effort because I
[42:07] Joker when we're not even awake he's
[42:10] working so you got to get in that month
[42:15] but that title deed of redemption was
[42:18] taken back we know for one thing's for
[42:20] sure that it wasn't just some off the
[42:25] wall something it was a book of names
[42:27] that what Adam was to do was to produce
[42:31] sons and daughters of God Adam and Eve
[42:34] Satan stopped that process by what sin
[42:38] by an act that God couldn't go over but
[42:42] he said I'll put enmity between me and
[42:44] you but when I come back I'm going to
[42:47] bring that back together the Bible says
[42:49] God and man had met heaven and earth is
[42:52] kissed hey man he put all this back
[42:56] together and in the process grace was
[43:02] revealed amen so now let's let's read
[43:07] number three
[43:08] go read three and four and then we're
[43:10] going to start in Genesis here Genesis
[43:12] 4:1 we got to get with we're trying to
[43:13] get Adam and Eve I mean trying to get
[43:15] Cain and Abel out of the womb we ain't
[43:16] gonna mother womb yet alright now look
[43:20] I'm going to read you this and then
[43:22] we're going to back up and read Genesis
[43:25] chapter four and see that remember that
[43:30] book of Redemption brother Brown said
[43:32] was a Seventh Seal book man the seal
[43:37] just didn't develop in the Book of
[43:39] Revelations that's what John saw John
[43:42] saw that scene in heaven of the seal
[43:47] being brought to be right but remember
[43:51] as long as Satan's been here there's
[43:54] been two spirits
[43:56] and then as long as Satan when sooner he
[43:58] was created and the Bible says what
[44:00] iniquity was found in his heart there's
[44:03] been a battle there's two spirits and
[44:05] the prophet of God tells us that now
[44:07] even today there's two spirits who will
[44:09] read it from the church age book if we
[44:11] ever get to it when I watch brother Ram
[44:13] said I will restore 1955
[44:15] now there's two spirits in those two
[44:17] boys talking about Cain and Abel all
[44:19] right if they was alive they had to have
[44:22] spirit now one of them was of the devil
[44:25] and the next one was of God it's exactly
[44:28] perfect Judas and Jesus Cain killed Abel
[44:31] at the altar so did Jesus killed Judas
[44:33] Jesus Judas killed Jesus that the author
[44:36] all the Bible's one big picture now
[44:38] let's read one more and then we'll get
[44:39] started because I want you to get your
[44:40] Bibles out to Genesis chapter 4 I'm
[44:43] going to bring it up here so you don't
[44:45] have to worry about it but if those of
[44:46] you that need your Bible need to get it
[44:48] out let's go to number 4 oh wait a
[44:51] minute I didn't read number 3 all the
[44:52] way through I'm sorry
[44:53] thank you that's why they hesitated they
[44:54] knew more about this and I did all right
[44:56] roll it back up now Cain and Abel both
[44:59] came to worship the Lord
[45:02] Cain built a church he built an altar an
[45:06] altar is a place of worship and came
[45:10] brought a sacrifice and Cain believed
[45:13] God listen Cain was not some evil drunk
[45:17] sight that never went to church he built
[45:20] the church all right Cain worship God so
[45:25] if God only requires for you to belong
[45:27] to a church make a confession in him for
[45:31] the devil tonight this morning and to
[45:33] bring an offering to him and a sacrifice
[45:35] he would be unjust to condemn Cain Abel
[45:39] brought an out made an altar he
[45:42] worshiped and brought a sacrifice they
[45:43] did the same thing both boys did the
[45:46] same thing
[45:47] Cain wasn't an infidel he was a very
[45:51] religious man did you know what the
[45:54] Bible says about the Antichrist it would
[45:56] be so close like the real it would
[45:58] deceive the very elect if possible now
[46:02] look this is now they profess religion
[46:04] now keep going now let's go to number 4
[46:06] and read it
[46:09] this is same from I will restore notice
[46:13] there started the two branches there
[46:17] started the tree next time I can enable
[46:19] they grow right up through the Bible
[46:22] both spirits and they're here tonight
[46:25] and they're all over the world amen
[46:29] so the two spirits are working keep
[46:32] going a little bit go down here there's
[46:34] been an enemy the spirit of Cain and the
[46:37] spirit of Abel from Genesis all the way
[46:40] through the Bible all the way over in
[46:42] Revelations from the creation till now
[46:44] and will be until Jesus comes do you
[46:48] understand that they were both religious
[46:50] and then if you were if you were an
[46:55] observer you would see Cain and Abel and
[46:57] they would be doing basically the same
[46:59] thing all right they both worship the
[47:03] same God they didn't even have three
[47:06] gods they didn't have a Trinity they
[47:08] knew they was one God amen because
[47:10] remember God speaks straight to Cain and
[47:12] just a few minutes we'll read it but God
[47:15] they both worship the same God they both
[47:17] confess the same God but God vindicated
[47:21] Abel he said this is my one and that's
[47:24] not mine but both of them worshipped him
[47:27] both of them belong to church amen
[47:30] I don't want to be home to a church I
[47:33] want to belong to the bride of Jesus
[47:35] Christ and man I don't want to be on to
[47:38] a church you belong to a church Satan
[47:40] Satan builds good churches listen folks
[47:45] you know as well as I do Satan was the
[47:47] one standing beside God he was the
[47:49] worship angel he loved worship that's
[47:53] what got him so caught up he loved
[47:55] people worshiping him rather than him
[47:58] reverting all the worship what I said
[48:01] this morning there's no man listen to me
[48:03] there's no man on the face of this earth
[48:06] could stand like William Branham have
[48:09] the signs and wonders and all the
[48:11] vindication and not get a big head come
[48:16] on people think of the things he lived
[48:20] so close to Garden Inn
[48:22] my how would you like to have a man that
[48:23] would walk up and walk through an Indian
[48:26] Reservation and sit down and and take a
[48:28] piece of paper and said your daddy was
[48:30] this one and your mama was here and you
[48:32] had this child and it was your grandpa
[48:34] remember he did that he went to that
[48:36] Indian Reservation they were trying to
[48:38] figure out who was who they'd lost all
[48:39] their records glogg came down through
[48:41] that man and he sat down wrote out the
[48:43] whole belly sold him out told him how
[48:45] far back their great-great
[48:46] great-grandfather was man can't do that
[48:51] you give it to a normal man as if his
[48:53] head doesn't get this big and what he'll
[48:56] do is he'll turn he used a gift wrong
[48:59] but he knew that little man would use it
[49:03] right and he got in trouble every once
[49:06] in a while because we're all human
[49:08] but God vindicated that prophet because
[49:11] we needed a prophet to tell us that
[49:14] brother Dale was coming this morning I
[49:15] was hoping he'd get into that brother
[49:17] Brad said he said it takes a prophet to
[49:19] what turn a corner to see that corner
[49:22] stone it sure you can make a straight
[49:24] line but it takes the foundation of the
[49:27] apostles and prophets to make a corner
[49:30] make a corner why because that buildings
[49:33] Foursquare so it's got four corners and
[49:36] it took a prophet to turn a corner it
[49:39] took a prophet in the same time to turn
[49:40] a corner sure we had reformers and we
[49:43] had all the but it took one that had to
[49:45] restore us back to where we wouldn't
[49:48] know where we came from know what we're
[49:50] doing here I know where we're going
[49:51] amen thank God for that we live in a
[49:55] wonderful hour we live in an eagle
[49:57] anointing age where all of us can be
[49:59] able to see not see with eyes we can
[50:01] understand what this Bible is about we
[50:04] can understand what happens in the
[50:06] garden and know that it tides you know
[50:08] when I was 14 years old sitting in this
[50:10] church listened to the preachers 14
[50:12] years old a long time ago when the
[50:16] church was this way you know they start
[50:19] preaching about Adam and Eve in the
[50:21] garden and you know fourteen-year-old
[50:23] kid you like manna know I knew that's
[50:27] what it was I think gosh that's all the
[50:30] way it could be
[50:31] it had to be sex in the garden it could
[50:33] have been
[50:34] an apple in it but you know what I
[50:36] didn't have the baptism of the Holy
[50:38] Ghost to tie the word together to tie it
[50:41] from Genesis to revelations or wear it
[50:43] tie those take those two spirits and
[50:45] show where they go but now see how God
[50:47] has brought us all up and all of us have
[50:49] matured to where we can see now that
[50:51] there's absolutely no way it could have
[50:54] happened then that way it's the only way
[50:59] it could brother Larry's I don't you
[51:01] know can't you go why can't people see
[51:04] that well it's hid from the eyes of the
[51:07] wise and prudent why didn't know just
[51:08] while he was riding and he saw what
[51:10] happened to the Beast and he why and he
[51:11] just write it down
[51:13] God said hide that you hide that because
[51:18] that's going to be a great mystery for
[51:21] those two spirits coming down all the
[51:23] way down through the church all right so
[51:24] now let's get started real quick let's
[51:26] go to Genesis 4 and we're going to go
[51:29] probably burst by verse if you'll bear
[51:33] with me for a minute
[51:34] I'm going to interpolate a little bit of
[51:39] what I think the conversation was about
[51:42] that all right an item knew Eve his wife
[51:50] and she conceived and bare Cain jahsh
[51:53] all that little Adam and Eve had a baby
[51:55] look one night with two children were
[51:58] born and she again bears brother Abel
[52:03] absolutely they were twins and then you
[52:08] say brother that's pretty hard to
[52:09] believe
[52:09] what was it California several years ago
[52:13] it even happened when brother Branham
[52:15] was alive because they had a picture of
[52:17] it that a white woman had sex relations
[52:20] with a black man in the morning and a
[52:22] white man in the afternoon and had a set
[52:24] of twins and one was white on the black
[52:26] so it can happen and it did happen it's
[52:29] exactly what happened Eve with the Beast
[52:31] in the morning brother Brown said in the
[52:33] hollow world he know that how do you
[52:35] know we've had blonde hair and blue eyes
[52:37] how do you know Adam had shoulder lean
[52:39] hair he was a prophet he was a prophet
[52:42] Moses Moses was a prophet without the
[52:45] new birth brother Branham was a prophet
[52:47] Newberg don't you think God to set him
[52:50] right over in the Garden of Eden and say
[52:51] look and he looks around and goes man
[52:55] he was beautiful Adam look at him okay
[52:59] so that's why we had to have an end time
[53:02] prophet we had to have an eagle
[53:03] anointing to get us up above all this
[53:04] other junk a man all this other junk
[53:07] that goes on in the world to get us
[53:09] above that to where we can see what
[53:12] forward and backwards because look
[53:15] eternity that's not just for word
[53:17] eternity goes as far that way as it does
[53:19] that way and then and she again now look
[53:23] now this is her doctrine even Adam knew
[53:29] Eve is laughing conceived and bare Cain
[53:32] and said I have gotten a man from the
[53:33] Lord now everybody's like well that must
[53:35] have come from Adam because she said
[53:37] I've gotten a man from the Lord every
[53:38] child comes from Lord don't matter if it
[53:39] was Adolf Hitler or John Dillinger they
[53:42] all get the Lord remember Satan is not a
[53:44] creator place the right thing together
[53:49] God has to put a soul in the body a man
[53:52] right and she again bare his brother
[53:56] Abel and Abel was a keeper the sheep but
[53:58] Cain was a tiller of the ground because
[53:59] now remember Cain started killing the
[54:03] ground now before this we rated a couple
[54:05] of Sundays ago for those of you that
[54:06] weren't here that ground that he's
[54:10] planting these potatoes in and corn was
[54:16] cursed by God Adam was not cursed it was
[54:20] not cursed the womb was cursed sure in
[54:24] childbearing Adam was not cursed the
[54:27] ground was cursed the man right that's
[54:30] all right that all right I'm going to
[54:33] read it so you can get it and in Adam
[54:36] because thou hearken to the voice of my
[54:38] wife and has eaten to the tree of which
[54:39] I commanded thee saying thou shalt not
[54:41] eat of it cursed is the ground for thy
[54:45] sake and man
[54:48] this ground is cursed I've told you
[54:51] before I don't worry about the earth
[54:53] this big ball of Earth this is the ball
[54:56] of Earth I'm concerned with and this is
[54:58] the ball earth that God's concerned with
[55:00] because remember
[55:01] we are the highest form of creation God
[55:06] created right man is the highest form
[55:10] when we fail everything fell hello when
[55:15] we fell everything fell behind us now
[55:18] that's why Romans 8 says that what the
[55:20] whole world is groaning and travailing
[55:23] the whole creation waiting on what us to
[55:27] get back to that item part 2 where we're
[55:30] ruler there look everything's out of
[55:32] allocator listen go back to where in
[55:40] Isaiah 65 it says the line will lay down
[55:42] with the lamb that they'll eat grass and
[55:45] and there'll be peace that's what listen
[55:49] that's not something new that's what was
[55:52] happening in the garden before man came
[55:54] along and sin that's why we're going
[55:58] back to that towards the lining the lamb
[56:01] lay down together the problem is the
[56:05] line will eat the lamb on this style of
[56:07] all it's called a food chain
[56:11] you better be glad there's not one above
[56:13] us you'd be in that chain that all right
[56:23] and in the process of time so the kids
[56:29] were growing up that all right the kids
[56:31] were growing up there listening still to
[56:34] mamma's doctrine because mama says y'all
[56:36] came from the Lord okay I gotten a man
[56:39] from the Lord because remember Cain
[56:42] didn't have a daddy
[56:43] tanks daddy got cursed that whole beast
[56:47] line was cursed so Cain didn't have a
[56:49] natural father that's why that's why the
[56:52] Bible says right here that Adam called
[56:56] his wife's name now Eve because what she
[56:59] was the mother of all living
[57:01] Adam knew he wasn't the father of all
[57:04] living
[57:05] he didn't say me and Eve or the father
[57:07] and mother of all living
[57:09] he said you are the mother of all living
[57:12] because all this came out of your womb
[57:14] and one of them wasn't mine and one of
[57:16] them was not all right I ought to tell
[57:19] you something right there but now look
[57:23] this second Adam he's the father of all
[57:30] that is going to be eternal amen
[57:37] preserved in the Father people Jesus
[57:41] Christ preserved in the father you'll
[57:43] get that in a minute and in the process
[57:46] of time it came to pass that Cain
[57:47] brought forth to the fruit of the ground
[57:48] an offering unto the Lord all right so
[57:54] now in the process of time we see that
[57:57] that I'm going to interpolate here just
[57:59] for a minute and B Cain and Abel talking
[58:01] together and you know Abel's going to be
[58:04] out with a sheep and Cain's going to be
[58:06] kind of getting everything ready and
[58:08] planting the potatoes and planting this
[58:10] and he's collecting this and I'm sure
[58:12] that when you look at that altar that
[58:15] was the potatoes was in the right place
[58:17] and and Cain had the right color
[58:19] over here and had the right beans over
[58:22] here and had to write onions over here
[58:25] and he had to write this and if you look
[58:27] at that probably some roses flowing down
[58:30] the altar beautiful saying you were
[58:35] beautiful
[58:37] Satan is not a red long tail with horn
[58:44] the Bible says he was the most beautiful
[58:47] angel you see Satan today he'd be the
[58:50] best-looking man you ever seen in your
[58:51] life but he's a deceiver
[58:55] so here's came with all this beauty well
[58:59] you go back and you look at the Roman
[59:01] Catholic Church sorry if there's anybody
[59:02] Roman Catholic around here but still
[59:04] look at all their beauty their pump
[59:06] their circumstance their beautiful
[59:07] colors they're just Randall was a
[59:09] Catholic beautiful huge buildings mark
[59:15] of the beef mark of the beef that's
[59:19] where it came from right here we're
[59:20] going to see it the minute well we might
[59:22] got to try to stay on my own and able
[59:26] so Cain brings this great flowing altar
[59:29] and he brings all the fruit and all the
[59:32] beautiful colors just a gala brought all
[59:35] the see those flowers over there they're
[59:37] so pretty not saying anything I'm just
[59:40] saying watch Kane when you walk up you
[59:42] go
[59:43] yeah when you want to start about that
[59:46] when you walk that when you walked up
[59:48] the cane look being humans when you walk
[59:52] up to Cain's altar you go God's God
[59:55] except that being in our human and maybe
[59:59] even Eve would walk up and say Cain boy
[1:00:02] you're looking good I said good looking
[1:00:05] altar but let's see what God thought
[1:00:08] about it go so they want your mom and
[1:00:09] daddy thinks about is what God thought
[1:00:11] about it all right an Abel now watch
[1:00:13] Abel Abel goes out and gets him a lamb
[1:00:16] now you have to check it make sure it's
[1:00:18] not going to know any blemishes on he
[1:00:20] takes that animal he walks up to the to
[1:00:22] the rock right beside of Cain and Cain's
[1:00:25] got all this beautiful stuff and Abel
[1:00:28] takes that way I'm and it's kicking and
[1:00:30] screaming he throws it there he probably
[1:00:31] sits on it holds his neck out and not
[1:00:34] having a knife not a good Swiss Army
[1:00:36] knife anyway he takes him hacks that
[1:00:39] thing and I'm sure the blood is probably
[1:00:40] splattering over on Cain's altering
[1:00:42] Kane's like what's your problem
[1:00:44] look how beautiful this is and look what
[1:00:47] a mess you're making but let's see what
[1:00:50] God says about it he took the first
[1:00:54] thing of his flock firstborn son of God
[1:00:57] and the Lord had respect unto Abel and
[1:01:01] his offering man God comes down and goes
[1:01:09] Abel beautiful that's exactly how I'm
[1:01:16] going to bring this back that's exactly
[1:01:19] property God said he got a revelation
[1:01:22] because he was tired I still I'm just
[1:01:25] I'm just honest he was tied back to Adam
[1:01:28] and Adam still I don't believe Adam
[1:01:30] became a grumpy old man
[1:01:33] what's the Paul happened no Adam had a
[1:01:36] job that was a job remember he was the
[1:01:39] only man
[1:01:40] he had to be like I said he had to be
[1:01:42] the doctor the lawyer the nurse the
[1:01:44] baker the the cook he had to be the
[1:01:47] whole thing I'm sure he delivered both
[1:01:50] children he was there who else is going
[1:01:53] to ever you can't call him in wife when
[1:01:55] there's only two people on earth so he
[1:01:59] had to be the Midwife he had to deliver
[1:02:01] him babies listen I believe Adam was
[1:02:05] highly intelligent
[1:02:06] I believe he didn't lose his
[1:02:08] intelligence because he had to God knew
[1:02:11] that too I know there's two men that I
[1:02:13] said I really want to talk about when I
[1:02:14] get to heaven Noah and Adam because Noah
[1:02:19] comes out of that flood living so many
[1:02:21] hundred years back this way when
[1:02:22] everything was just like it is now and
[1:02:24] he walks out of that boat to nothing
[1:02:27] Adam comes from this great almost
[1:02:32] eternal bliss and then he gets kicked
[1:02:34] out of the garden and finally he starts
[1:02:36] sweating he has to take care of Eve he
[1:02:40] has to take care of the kids he has to
[1:02:42] take now he's got to keep the animals
[1:02:44] off of him so he's got to build a
[1:02:45] shelter she won't come up kind of what
[1:02:49] we do now but thank God we're going back
[1:02:52] we're going back to that time when Adam
[1:02:54] and Eve all they had to do was worry
[1:02:56] about each other they just worried they
[1:02:57] just was it was just bliss but unto Cain
[1:03:00] and to his offering he had not respect
[1:03:02] and Cain was very wroth I love Cain was
[1:03:07] very wroth and his countenance fell Wow
[1:03:11] now look now they see that capital LRD
[1:03:16] so the Lord is speaking straight to Cain
[1:03:20] he's not speaking through an interpreter
[1:03:22] he's not speaking through Adam he's
[1:03:25] speaking straight to Cain and the Lord
[1:03:29] said unto Cain why art thou wroth and
[1:03:32] why is thy countenance fallen if thou
[1:03:36] doest well shalt thou not be accepted he
[1:03:43] extended grace right there that is Grace
[1:03:47] to came but what they can't do now look
[1:03:51] God give him both options
[1:03:54] and if don't quit moving in things if
[1:03:57] y'all do is not swell then lies at the
[1:04:00] door when lustres can see that brings
[1:04:02] forth sin when sin is finished it brings
[1:04:05] forth death now let's watch him go
[1:04:06] through those four stages right here for
[1:04:09] just a few minutes everybody all right
[1:04:10] say ma'am
[1:04:11] Angeles y'all stand awake today y'all
[1:04:14] need to drink more coffee or taste b12
[1:04:16] or something everybody got their
[1:04:17] spinners y'all doing good today and it
[1:04:20] came to pass when they were in the field
[1:04:22] that Cain rose up oh wait a minute
[1:04:24] and unto thee shall be his desire and
[1:04:28] thou shalt rule over him what sin sin
[1:04:32] he's telling you he said if you do this
[1:04:34] then it is going to be your desire and
[1:04:37] that things going to you and him going
[1:04:39] to rule each other it's going to rule
[1:04:41] you and Cain talked with Abel about what
[1:04:49] Abel no give me this doctrine again give
[1:04:53] me this new thing you've got how did God
[1:04:56] accept that sacrifice and not mine
[1:04:59] because I don't see because Cain
[1:05:06] couldn't he have a revelation Cain
[1:05:07] couldn't see see means understand not
[1:05:10] physically see but Cain couldn't
[1:05:11] understand because Cain talked with Abel
[1:05:14] his brother and it came to pass it
[1:05:16] wasn't just one day conversation they
[1:05:18] probably had a few church services hello
[1:05:20] they probably had a few church services
[1:05:22] with just him and Abel because there
[1:05:24] wasn't anybody else stepmom and daddy
[1:05:25] when they were in the field that Cain
[1:05:29] rose up against Abel his brother and
[1:05:31] slew him that all right
[1:05:35] and the Lord said unto Cain where is
[1:05:40] Abel thy brother and look at that line
[1:05:45] spirit I know not am I my brother's
[1:05:49] keeper
[1:05:50] he's talking to God see how brazen he is
[1:05:54] he was talking to God he said my brother
[1:05:55] brother's keeper and he said what has
[1:05:57] out done the voice of thy brother's
[1:06:00] blood now what blood doesn't have a
[1:06:01] voice physical blood doesn't have a
[1:06:04] voice but what happened is is he heard
[1:06:07] Abell is over in another dimension now
[1:06:11] Abel's somewhere he's over in another
[1:06:13] dimension that they had nobody men
[1:06:15] before hello
[1:06:17] they've been no death before this right
[1:06:20] here Abel had to go somewhere so labels
[1:06:24] over in another dimension but his blood
[1:06:26] is crying out unto me from the ground
[1:06:29] and now art thou cursed from the earth
[1:06:33] which has opened up her mouth to receive
[1:06:37] thy brother's blood from thy hand when
[1:06:41] thou tillest the ground it shall not
[1:06:43] henceforth yield unto thee her strength
[1:06:44] a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be
[1:06:48] in the earth and Cain said the Lord my
[1:06:51] punishment is greater than I can bear
[1:06:53] pour bless his heart behold thou hast
[1:06:59] driven me out of this day from the face
[1:07:01] of the earth and from thy face shall I
[1:07:03] be hid and I shall be a fugitive Cain
[1:07:07] saying this Cain's passing his own
[1:07:10] judgment because watch what happens at
[1:07:13] the end and then we're going to go back
[1:07:14] and look at something real quick I shall
[1:07:17] be a fugitive and a vagabond in the
[1:07:18] earth and it shall come to pass that
[1:07:19] everyone that findeth me shall slay me
[1:07:22] and the Lord said unto him therefore
[1:07:24] whosoever slayeth Cain vengeance shall
[1:07:26] be taken on him Sevenfold and the Lord
[1:07:28] said a mark upon Cain lest any finding
[1:07:33] him should kill him keep going and came
[1:07:36] without from the presence of the Lord
[1:07:38] that was his mistake and dwelt in the
[1:07:41] Land of Nod on the East of Eden that's
[1:07:44] why when I tell y'all I try to get to be
[1:07:45] preached to you before you get to the
[1:07:47] Land of Nod because Cain went to the
[1:07:52] Land of Nod so I don't want you to go to
[1:07:54] the Land of Nod alright so now what
[1:07:57] let's go through the Bible bring back
[1:07:59] Genesis chapter 4 again and let's just
[1:08:01] run through it real quick brother Dale
[1:08:03] did this a long time ago showing that
[1:08:08] the book of Redemption the seals are in
[1:08:11] the book of Genesis alright then alright
[1:08:14] how many remember that they probably
[1:08:15] went a lot of you here but anyway so now
[1:08:17] watch verse 7 God
[1:08:21] is giving caning out all right God is
[1:08:25] now look if thou doest well shalt thou
[1:08:29] not be accepted and if thou doest not
[1:08:32] well sin lies at the door and it says
[1:08:35] these shall be his desire and thou shalt
[1:08:38] rule over him now look what was Cain's
[1:08:42] problem his doctrine Cain's problem was
[1:08:49] his preconceived idea that he was right
[1:08:53] is that all right say man and then so
[1:08:57] now we got to look when the lust has
[1:08:59] conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin
[1:09:03] when it is finished bringeth forth death
[1:09:04] now what is the white horse rider the
[1:09:07] white horse rider is what a white
[1:09:10] righteous church I'm right you're not
[1:09:16] I'm right because I'm white I'm white
[1:09:20] righteous Church because that's what's
[1:09:23] happening right here there's a wild
[1:09:27] horse rider that's riding so close till
[1:09:31] there is a true white righteous but
[1:09:33] there is a false because Cain is riding
[1:09:35] so close to Abel and so close to the
[1:09:38] truth til it's going to take God to
[1:09:39] separate them man and it's going to take
[1:09:42] God to separate it in the end time
[1:09:44] because remember it says it would even
[1:09:45] almost deceive the very leg listen I'm
[1:09:48] telling you if we were standing in the
[1:09:50] garden and standing off and watching
[1:09:52] what was going on we would wonder why
[1:09:55] God is punishing came we would wonder
[1:09:59] because you look at this altar and I'm
[1:10:02] sure Cain worship he didn't just throw
[1:10:05] the thing down he set it up exactly the
[1:10:07] way he wanted it I'm sure he prayed I'm
[1:10:11] sure he cried I'm sure he said God this
[1:10:14] is what I brought to you today this is
[1:10:16] the sacrifice of my sweat of my brow and
[1:10:19] and all these things and then you got
[1:10:21] Abel you think you think Abel would be
[1:10:25] the bad boy he probably just walked up
[1:10:29] here and goes god I've had some bad
[1:10:31] thoughts today and I know
[1:10:35] that I was born in my mother's blood and
[1:10:37] I know that there was something to do
[1:10:39] with blood I may not get all of it at
[1:10:41] the right moment but there's something
[1:10:43] there's something about this animal
[1:10:45] giving his life that's going to help me
[1:10:49] get closer to you he throws that thing
[1:10:52] down there and he just I mean the guy's
[1:10:55] probably looks like a mass murderer when
[1:10:58] he gets finished but God said that's my
[1:11:01] child that's my boy the blood sacrifice
[1:11:05] will always work works Cain works will
[1:11:11] not work that's why I said Abel had no
[1:11:15] work Abel didn't work he was like the
[1:11:18] prophet of God said he's laying on the
[1:11:20] side of the woods under a shade tree
[1:11:23] watching the animals and gets her you
[1:11:26] know he gets a he hooks a table and
[1:11:29] looks at Canaan says well it's time to
[1:11:30] time to go to the altar and he drags a
[1:11:32] lamb picks the lamb drags it down then
[1:11:34] throws it on then kills it dresses it
[1:11:37] probably and burns it well the prophet
[1:11:39] of God said God came down and burn for
[1:11:40] sacrifice Yoder how did you know that
[1:11:43] Bible don't say that the Bible said God
[1:11:47] accepted Cain's
[1:11:48] I mean Abel's sacrifice brother Branham
[1:11:51] said that God came down and vindicated
[1:11:53] it by consuming it with fire and then
[1:11:55] what happened on Mount Carmel a man
[1:11:58] God's consistent all the way through so
[1:12:01] iswhy brother branham even if he didn't
[1:12:03] see it he could go back in the Word of
[1:12:05] God and know that every time God
[1:12:06] accepted something he brought fire when
[1:12:09] he accepted you he brought fire hey man
[1:12:12] he brought fire and he burnt that old
[1:12:14] nature out of you a man now we are
[1:12:18] living sacrifice to God acceptable and
[1:12:21] holy that's what the Bible says about us
[1:12:22] okay
[1:12:23] alright so now but we see that that Cain
[1:12:27] is now obviously Cain's building a case
[1:12:31] he's saying I'm just as religious
[1:12:34] because right here he was talking about
[1:12:36] why is you counting this Roth in the
[1:12:38] cases I am I my brother's keeper
[1:12:41] Cain is so self-righteous he still
[1:12:44] thinks he's right right he still today
[1:12:46] thinks he's right
[1:12:48] a man so that white horse didn't begin a
[1:12:51] season look the book was sealed remember
[1:12:56] right so the understanding of this was
[1:13:01] sealed Daniel seal seal it seal it all
[1:13:04] the way to where the end time where the
[1:13:06] property God took those seals brother
[1:13:12] Brown didn't break the seal the mighty
[1:13:15] angel broke the seal the property God
[1:13:18] gave us the interpretation and man but
[1:13:22] who was standing in the garden with the
[1:13:24] book in his hand he knew what was in
[1:13:27] there so he showed up tight of the seals
[1:13:30] all the way from Genesis through the
[1:13:33] Bible and then the actual scene now
[1:13:36] let's look we're playing it out right
[1:13:40] now we're playing it out today today
[1:13:44] we're playing that we still have the
[1:13:45] white righteous church and we still have
[1:13:48] the white real church a man there's got
[1:13:52] a Satan has to be an imposter
[1:13:54] he can't ride out before God for
[1:13:56] anything he is never an originator Satan
[1:14:01] has not ever got anything over on God
[1:14:04] and never will so when that wild horse
[1:14:08] rider rode out when the seal will open
[1:14:11] God already had a white church on the
[1:14:14] earth he already had Abel standing on
[1:14:18] the earth he already had Adam standing
[1:14:21] on the earth but Satan comes out and
[1:14:23] says I'm just as good as rest up I'm
[1:14:28] just as good as they are
[1:14:29] I what's wrong with my church you know
[1:14:35] it's like accident Baptists the other
[1:14:37] day says why don't you in the Methodist
[1:14:38] why don't you show up churches I said
[1:14:40] when you get to heaven you're gonna have
[1:14:42] a Baptist City in the Methodist city and
[1:14:44] the Pentecostal city
[1:14:45] I take y'all can't get along down here
[1:14:49] and he giggled and walked off because he
[1:14:54] knew because I said why don't you accept
[1:14:56] Martin Luther's doctrine because you are
[1:14:59] Baptists so you split you saw why we go
[1:15:02] together yeah but you get down start
[1:15:03] talking my doctor that's what happened
[1:15:07] right here denomination and no
[1:15:13] denomination this is the two spirits
[1:15:17] that we're dealing with right now and
[1:15:19] I'm not saying I didn't say denomination
[1:15:23] and message so there's this much
[1:15:26] denomination in this message is when
[1:15:28] they was right here cuz look they'll
[1:15:31] kill you in the name of this message you
[1:15:34] don't believe what they believe you'll
[1:15:40] know those laws under a man property God
[1:15:45] said it's not killing the man physically
[1:15:46] now it's killing them what spiritually
[1:15:49] that's worse
[1:15:51] that's worse but watch this verse eight
[1:16:01] so now Cain's on his high horse in other
[1:16:04] words Cain's on his white horse the wild
[1:16:05] horses come out and he is not going to
[1:16:09] give it up he thinks he's right when
[1:16:14] that wild horse rode out in that first
[1:16:15] church age what he thought he was right
[1:16:18] but Paul already said before he died he
[1:16:21] said Grievous wolves are coming and are
[1:16:25] already even John says they're already
[1:16:27] here they're among you why because there
[1:16:30] was a white righteous church already on
[1:16:32] the earth a man then he comes Satan
[1:16:36] comes behind him riding with all these
[1:16:39] powers that were given to him listen no
[1:16:42] one gives God power but Satan has to be
[1:16:48] given power right if we'll ever
[1:16:52] understand that we might can talk about
[1:16:54] death and how it's destroyed and Cain
[1:17:01] talked with Abel his brother
[1:17:02] now watch now we see remember when lust
[1:17:06] is conceived now a conception is an act
[1:17:10] you sit down and talk about a plan but
[1:17:14] then the conception of the
[1:17:16] plan is if you're thinking about it
[1:17:18] you're getting ready to implement the
[1:17:20] plan so you come and you see the
[1:17:22] conception know what and Cain talked
[1:17:26] with Abel now what's the next color of
[1:17:28] the next horse that's going to ride
[1:17:31] what's the next color red blood and Cain
[1:17:38] talked with Abel his brother and it came
[1:17:39] to pass when they were in the field that
[1:17:40] Cain rose up against Abel his brother
[1:17:42] and slew him whatever here's doctrine
[1:17:45] that began with now it's coming to more
[1:17:48] into fruition because Cain is not
[1:17:50] letting it stop he's continually letting
[1:17:52] it go on when lust is conceived at red
[1:17:59] horse rider what was it the property
[1:18:02] guard said he went out what killing with
[1:18:05] a what a sword
[1:18:06] what is the sword the word Satan was
[1:18:10] given a word actually Satan took God's
[1:18:15] Word and just added one to it Satan took
[1:18:19] God took God's Word and perverted it so
[1:18:23] the next horse is read the conception we
[1:18:28] run through these real quick then I had
[1:18:31] a couple of questions I want to stop
[1:18:33] here just saying I had a couple of
[1:18:34] questions on the Genesis 1:26 man some
[1:18:37] of you not really understanding it and
[1:18:38] that's okay it's kind of complicated
[1:18:40] till you really get to understand it but
[1:18:42] I want to do next Sunday brother
[1:18:44] Prakash's coming so the next Sunday if
[1:18:46] you have any questions about the Genesis
[1:18:48] 1:26 and the fall of today will answer
[1:18:52] some questions so if you have questions
[1:18:54] write them down give them to me giving a
[1:18:56] brother Dale because I want to get that
[1:18:57] Genesis 1:26 man if we get that thing
[1:19:00] right then I believe it's it's what
[1:19:03] we're missing even though we have it
[1:19:06] even though we have it I don't know that
[1:19:11] we know what we have fully know what we
[1:19:14] have call that so Genesis 1:26 man never
[1:19:17] died never sinned and it's inside of us
[1:19:24] what are we doing God is trying to
[1:19:27] unbind it and we're trying to wrap it
[1:19:29] back up just like this right here God is
[1:19:33] trying to give Cain a time to repent
[1:19:35] he's giving Cain time to think about
[1:19:39] what you're doing son think about what
[1:19:41] you're doing because you're fixing that
[1:19:43] what you're fixing to go all the way
[1:19:45] into death you're fixing tool all the
[1:19:47] way into darkness where you'll never
[1:19:49] come out of it again because remember
[1:19:51] the mark that was put on Cain was the
[1:19:55] mark of the beast
[1:19:56] right you want to know where the marker
[1:20:00] be started Cain right down there to
[1:20:03] bottom let me go through this real quick
[1:20:05] then we'll back up but remember the
[1:20:08] second horse rider was what red blood
[1:20:12] brother Brown says Cain come to the
[1:20:15] point he said either God either take it
[1:20:17] or leave it now what about where did
[1:20:19] that spirit come from but do you know
[1:20:22] what in that second part of that of that
[1:20:25] red horse going out to the through the
[1:20:27] ages that coming up into the Dark Ages
[1:20:29] that's what the Catholic Church was
[1:20:32] doing that said you either take our
[1:20:33] denomination or we're going to kill you
[1:20:37] sixty-eight million Christians were
[1:20:41] killed by the Catholic Church and they
[1:20:43] admit it property guard said no telling
[1:20:46] how many more millions by their doctrine
[1:20:51] amen
[1:20:52] so that horse is starting he's riding he
[1:20:56] has now he's in the conception stage and
[1:20:58] then now watch verse 11 and now art thou
[1:21:03] cursed God said we're getting to the
[1:21:10] place where now where you're not coming
[1:21:11] back now art thou cursed what's the
[1:21:15] third horse rider what was Black Death
[1:21:20] the third horse rider now art thou
[1:21:24] cursed from the earth which opened up
[1:21:27] her mouth when lust has conceived it
[1:21:29] brings forth sin sin is the separator
[1:21:34] now art thou cursed
[1:21:36] in other words Cain
[1:21:38] you have send away your day'll grade
[1:21:40] denominations you have send away your
[1:21:42] day of grades I tell them how about if
[1:21:45] you see a man al old man from Kentucky
[1:21:47] that can't hardly speak a word in
[1:21:48] English he walks up in front of the
[1:21:50] denominational world he's preaching to
[1:21:52] five or ten thousand people and you know
[1:21:55] it's not so bad if we sit here and say
[1:21:57] that that the Father Son Holy Ghost
[1:21:59] doctrine came from the pits of hell go
[1:22:02] over there and tell that Baptist Church
[1:22:03] that only a prophet would know now look
[1:22:08] the people didn't the doctrine came from
[1:22:13] the pizza head the doctrine not the
[1:22:15] people the doctrine but watch now watch
[1:22:19] though dr. King if you'll do good you
[1:22:25] can be a label but Cain's problem is he
[1:22:29] keeps going in the other direction so
[1:22:33] there's a day where God winked at the
[1:22:35] ignorance of the father son Holy Ghost
[1:22:37] baptism of the Trinitarian God in three
[1:22:39] persons which is it's not even sensible
[1:22:44] because the person is the personality
[1:22:47] personality an individual individual
[1:22:49] person so you got three guards there is
[1:22:51] no three God there's one God amen and
[1:22:54] he's the creator he's the Christ he's a
[1:22:56] son of God he's the son of man he's a
[1:22:59] son of David he's the father son Holy
[1:23:01] Ghost one man amen
[1:23:05] that's what Cain couldn't see Cain's
[1:23:08] doctrine kept carrying him away it took
[1:23:11] him to the pits of hell because what he
[1:23:14] didn't do he didn't stop when lust has
[1:23:16] conceived it brings forth sin when sin
[1:23:19] is what finished when it comes to the
[1:23:22] finality and we're going to see right
[1:23:24] here real quick and maybe we'll come
[1:23:26] back to this again but watch in verse 16
[1:23:30] Cain went out from the presence of the
[1:23:34] Lord what's the fourth horse rider The
[1:23:36] Pale Horse which is what eternal
[1:23:41] separation from God because God didn't
[1:23:46] cast Cain out
[1:23:48] Cain went out Cain let that was his
[1:23:52] whole problem
[1:23:54] he said I'm right and God you're wrong
[1:23:58] so the pale horse rider is what white
[1:24:01] red and black mixed together mates pale
[1:24:05] horse all of that doctrine of Cain and
[1:24:08] everything came did and everything that
[1:24:11] God tried to do for Cain culminated it
[1:24:14] right here when sin is finished it
[1:24:17] brings forth death
[1:24:18] Cain cannot come back never will come
[1:24:21] back we know in the mind of God he
[1:24:23] didn't know if wasn't going to come back
[1:24:24] but Cain didn't know that now let's read
[1:24:27] this one quote we'll stop right here
[1:24:29] revelation to Jesus Christ will we've
[1:24:31] read this before now remember this
[1:24:33] Christ in the true church is a
[1:24:35] continuation of the book of Acts but the
[1:24:38] book of Revelation show how that
[1:24:40] Antichrist spirit would come into the
[1:24:41] church and defile it making it lukewarm
[1:24:45] formal and powerless it exposes Satan
[1:24:49] revealing his words now what happened
[1:24:51] Satan got into Cain and it's been hit
[1:24:57] it's all we see it but the world don't
[1:25:00] see it they all think they're right
[1:25:03] you say brother you think you're right
[1:25:05] we're closer to the fruits has ever been
[1:25:09] we had close to the fruits as anybody's
[1:25:11] ever been no we are all exactly right
[1:25:14] but we're getting there God come down
[1:25:20] one day and looked at you just like you
[1:25:21] did Cain he said look if you don't turn
[1:25:24] around sin lives at your door death
[1:25:29] lives at your door if you don't turn
[1:25:31] around so you got a choice Cain had a
[1:25:34] choice we see people say well Cain
[1:25:36] didn't have a choice in the mind of God
[1:25:37] Cain didn't have a choice but in the
[1:25:39] mind of God the only reason Cain didn't
[1:25:41] have a choice it's caused by
[1:25:42] foreknowledge God saw that he choose
[1:25:44] that I don't know what I could ever say
[1:25:47] that again but but that was good the
[1:25:50] first time that's all right that's why
[1:25:52] we take these things but really
[1:25:56] foreknowledge is he foreknew Jacob have
[1:25:59] I loved how could he condemned he saw
[1:26:02] when he wasn't even born yet in the mind
[1:26:05] of God he was condemned because god
[1:26:07] looked down sometime and said he saw
[1:26:09] you're a rascal you're just like Cain
[1:26:12] so you're mark and then it exposes Satan
[1:26:17] revealing his words attempting
[1:26:20] destruction of God's people look Satan
[1:26:23] is very religious he's not trying to
[1:26:25] discredit God by being a prostitute or a
[1:26:27] drug dealer or you understand what I'm
[1:26:29] saying if Satan can get me and you he's
[1:26:34] got it but he can't and then because of
[1:26:39] the foreknowledge of God he saw that
[1:26:40] somebody would want it and would be here
[1:26:43] to receive it and when God come down one
[1:26:46] day and said don't be like Cain today
[1:26:50] Moses stood there one day and so did
[1:26:53] Joshua said choose you this day whom
[1:26:55] serve that's what God said to Cain he
[1:26:57] said choose you this day now here say
[1:26:59] now Cain bless your heart you'll be okay
[1:27:02] no he said sin lives at your door today
[1:27:06] you'll either be the master of sin or
[1:27:07] it'll be the master of you and it became
[1:27:10] the master of came because of the choice
[1:27:12] that he made and then all right let's
[1:27:14] read isten we'll be done it exposes
[1:27:16] Satan revealing his worst attempts to
[1:27:18] destruction of God's people and the
[1:27:19] discrediting of God's Word that's what
[1:27:21] Satan did in the beginning right down to
[1:27:24] the time he is cast into the lake of
[1:27:25] fire
[1:27:26] hey listen he don't give up when God's
[1:27:31] getting ready to kick him over in the
[1:27:32] lake of fire he's still going I can't
[1:27:34] win this is heart you can't get saved
[1:27:37] that's his problem that's why I can't
[1:27:38] win he fights that he cannot stand it he
[1:27:41] knows that if the people get the true
[1:27:44] revelation Rota of the true church and
[1:27:47] what she is what she stands for and what
[1:27:51] she can do and that she can do the
[1:27:53] greater works she will be an invincible
[1:27:55] army if they get a true revelation of
[1:27:58] the to spirit
[1:27:59] within the framework of the Christian
[1:28:00] Christian Church right there's a bar
[1:28:04] bother you just going to a bar bother
[1:28:07] you I go to bars all the time all the
[1:28:11] ones I want to go to I eat candy bars
[1:28:14] I love almond joys you thought somebody
[1:28:17] drinking did you don't do that till I do
[1:28:21] I drink all I want to I curse all I want
[1:28:24] to I run around all I want to but that
[1:28:28] want to left me alone coming home so I
[1:28:30] don't want to do it the more I did it
[1:28:32] one time but God came by one day and
[1:28:35] said two spirits two spirits today has
[1:28:42] been giving you an opportunity choose
[1:28:45] you this day which one you'll serve now
[1:28:47] in lesson though we can go through
[1:28:50] remember I taught that scripture when
[1:28:51] lust is conceded it keeps get when lust
[1:28:54] is listen God forbid don't get me wrong
[1:28:57] lust is not a killer got it
[1:29:01] listen foe we're human you don't lust
[1:29:05] now like you used to know but when lust
[1:29:08] has conceived it brings forth sin when
[1:29:10] sins finished it brings forth death
[1:29:12] right what came done is he didn't have
[1:29:15] anything in him to stop him in that
[1:29:17] process you and I had something called
[1:29:20] predestination by foreknowledge god I
[1:29:23] tell them this morning God give you an
[1:29:25] angel to stay with you from the time you
[1:29:28] were born to whatever day it is you may
[1:29:32] not to realize that but you know what if
[1:29:33] you were a seed childhood garden so I
[1:29:35] saw one day he'd come to you and say
[1:29:37] accept me or reject me and you accepted
[1:29:41] him it's like King David King David knew
[1:29:46] that when God through Samuel said David
[1:29:50] you will be the king of Israel and I
[1:29:54] don't believe David got the big hair but
[1:29:56] I believe David kind of walked around he
[1:29:57] didn't walk out in the middle I 85 I'm
[1:29:59] standing the middle of the road he
[1:30:01] didn't tempt God but he knew one thing
[1:30:02] was for sure they wouldn't know little
[1:30:04] or big Goliath
[1:30:06] going to bother him that's why he walk
[1:30:10] and he listened I've seen about this

[1:38:21] my Redeemer praising listen you're not
[1:38:28] privileged people extremely privileged
[1:38:31] to be able to look at that Seventh Seal
[1:38:36] book because remember no one was worthy
[1:38:38] to even look at it
[1:38:39] so if you can't look at you can't read
[1:38:42] it but by Jesus Christ dying taking the
[1:38:46] book and open it and then the one that
[1:38:48] wrote the book comes down inside of you
[1:38:50] with the book open amen then there's
[1:38:54] your open book you are the open book you
[1:38:57] are then you are now the recipient
[1:38:59] you're the recipient of the seals being
[1:39:03] broke and then because I was telling
[1:39:06] them downstairs you know we're going
[1:39:08] through the seals if I'm saying if if
[1:39:12] the property God broke those seals I'm
[1:39:14] saying it for you if the property God
[1:39:16] broke those seals that did never when he
[1:39:18] whipped the top off of that pyramid and
[1:39:20] look down he said light had never shown
[1:39:21] Outlook it wasn't that the words were
[1:39:26] something different
[1:39:27] he just said light hadn't shined on
[1:39:29] those because you remember you can't add
[1:39:31] can add to the Bible and can't take away
[1:39:33] from the Bible had to be something that
[1:39:34] was a hidden mystery well why didn't a
[1:39:36] rapture take place that Sunday night
[1:39:38] when the seals were preached because he
[1:39:43] said you're not getting it in other
[1:39:46] words those people with their ideas I
[1:39:49] said ideas I didn't say denomination but
[1:39:51] with their ideas you know what they did
[1:39:54] they closed it back up that book was
[1:39:57] right there where they could grab it and
[1:39:59] their ideas closed it right back up
[1:40:02] sealed it up property God said it's not
[1:40:04] even for you he said but right around
[1:40:06] the coming of the Lord I think we're
[1:40:08] here don't you think
[1:40:08] don't you think that those things had
[1:40:10] been that had been hidden that no man no
[1:40:13] man has known you
[1:40:16] thank Cain and Abel do you think even
[1:40:18] Abraham Abraham
[1:40:20] I don't believe Abraham was sitting
[1:40:21] there one day and he's like man six
[1:40:23] thousand years from now they gonna be
[1:40:25] talking about me he just went through
[1:40:28] life he knew he was a little bit special
[1:40:31] because God spoke to him but he I
[1:40:33] believe he uh he didn't wake up one
[1:40:35] morning to go I'm the father of the face
[1:40:38] my man my name is gonna be written in a
[1:40:40] book forever no he doesn't realize what
[1:40:43] do you do brother Brown said those
[1:40:44] people just lived their life was led by
[1:40:48] the Lord lived their life and then now
[1:40:51] you look I mean Hebrews eleven studying
[1:40:53] a little bit now there's what there's
[1:40:56] the faith the you and I when Abraham
[1:40:59] come to the date of where Abraham said
[1:41:01] god I can't do it I can't physically
[1:41:05] produce this child I'm done I'm washed
[1:41:07] up I'm finished I'm dead and God said no
[1:41:12] no I knew that when you first started
[1:41:14] but I wanted you to realize that that's
[1:41:17] right man say you know Moses Moses was
[1:41:20] his choice from the beginning of the
[1:41:21] world but Moses didn't know he was the
[1:41:24] choice in begin the world but what did
[1:41:25] Moses do Moses worked into a place to
[1:41:28] write the five books of the Bible so I
[1:41:29] think he maybe knew that he had a little
[1:41:31] place somewhere but I think the bride of
[1:41:34] Jesus Christ I think like Leo said in
[1:41:35] the in the quote when she realizes the
[1:41:39] two spirits in the framework of the
[1:41:42] church what's our problem now we don't
[1:41:49] know we do we listen we do know the two
[1:41:53] spirits but sometimes remember they're
[1:41:55] so close till they'll almost deceive the
[1:41:59] very leg what's going to have to happen
[1:42:00] is is it's going to have to do this it's
[1:42:03] going to have to come to a separate in
[1:42:04] time where you got to know that you know
[1:42:07] that you know I'm telling you people
[1:42:08] it's coming to the day where we if we
[1:42:10] don't know I mean by revelation not just
[1:42:14] know if we don't know by revelation what
[1:42:16] this Bible talking about we're dead
[1:42:18] people we're dead people we got to know
[1:42:22] what this Bible says and get a
[1:42:24] revelation of the two spirits in the
[1:42:27] framework of the church
[1:42:29] Abel and Cain started in the garden you
[1:42:32] know where it's going to end up back in
[1:42:34] the garden but what's going to happen
[1:42:37] when we go back to that garden they was
[1:42:39] a second Adam took my place and there's
[1:42:44] not a Cain spirit going to go back in
[1:42:45] that garden he took and wiped out away
[1:42:48] when he died at Calvary he wiped that
[1:42:51] cain spirit away you saw no it's still
[1:42:53] here yeah still here because you just
[1:42:54] said it was did you what you see what
[1:42:57] you just did he took that away well I am
[1:43:01] still here
[1:43:02] it's still here well because then it
[1:43:06] must be in you a fish still here and man
[1:43:10] so let's start saying I'm redeemed by
[1:43:15] love divine glory glory Christ is mine
[1:43:22] all to him I now reason I have been I
[1:43:29] have been renamed oh I'm ready my love
