energy left to Worship the Lord tonight and to take in what the Lord has in store for us amen um okay this uh this evening we're going to speak on a short short subject it's just a short one I entitled it the revealing of the Bride amen the revealing of the Bride our text is going to be found in uh Revelations chap 10: 10 and 11 and we read and I look I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples Nations tongues and Kings I believe this is our commission today this is the bride's commission today you must prophesy again right Hallelujah again because we've heard a prophecy yeah we've heard the message right and uh the Lord is not expecting us to reinvent the message to preach something new but we have to prophesy again just repeat it amen repeat the the message before many peoples Nations and tongs that's right habac chapter 2 and verse4 I said if we did our job these scriptures would have been prophec uh would have been fulfilled today if we did our job it says for the Earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord the knowledge of the glory of the Lord is in the message right amen the the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea meaning this message will spread to the every corner of the world Hallelujah uh praise God let us pray Heavenly Father once again uh we come to before your throne asking that you U come and speak to hearts and Minds touch the people's lives and meet every need tonight because we believe that there is power in the name of Jesus there is power that lays within your word and we're talking about your word this evening uh and it changes not it's the same yesterday today and forever and so we are just resting in every promise that's in the Bible give you praise and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated I told my friend but way uh I told him you didn't you didn't visit me this year so so he promised and I'm telling the church he promised maybe next year yeah maybe next well praise the Lord um well it's been some time also since brother Dale went over to the Philippines you know and we want you to come back too right amen and uh brother Louise the Believers in the Philippines are also waiting for you okay so brother bham uh spoke about a Revival that will never be noticed it will never be noticed by the world right it takes all it's it's it goes on but it's uh the world will know nothing about it he said it in the seed is not air of the shock uh not not air with the shock he said it takes the spirit of God God to bring life and that life must come out must not come out of just the intellectual Revival it's got to come out of the Bible amen right right a word Revival I like that a word Revival and that word is the same yesterday today and forever right this is not going to be a crowd Revival so we're not looking for mega churches Mega message churches right that's right this is not going to be a repeat of what happened probably in ausa street right right you know uh a lot of gifts manifestation of gifts and but we like that you know and uh and God can still move in know in in in the same way we understand that it doesn't change but uh BR is speaking about a different kind of Revival he said I believe we are living in a very wonderful glorious day of opportunity when people of this day of this day are are are living leaving to see the Shadows of the coming of the Son of God I believe with all my heart that the world is going to burst now into the greatest Revival think of that said this into the greatest Revival that was ever known or it's going into the darkest chaos that's ever been known in history and this this is both happening today amen one happens to the believer correct and the other one to the world that's right you see the world is now in the darkest chaos that's ever known in history amen but to the bride of Christ we are experiencing we're supposed to be experiencing the greatest Revival that's ever known Hallelujah and then he said the Revival will be so small that they will never know it happened think about it they'll never know it happened that's correct you see it amen it passes and nobody noticed it said this in in in this see is not there with with the shop amen this is our importance in God God's plan Hebrews 11:40 I want you to see what God is doing in our midst right now right right before the shadow of the coming of the Son of God right I think you believe with me that we are now at the end of the very end amen hallelujah right at the shadow of the coming of the son son of Son of God Hebrews 11:14 say says God having provided some better thing for us you know after enumerating the heroes of faith those great Giants of faith in the Bible and then this Paul writes God provides some better thing for us amen sure right yes sir you don't think better things could happen but God has provided better things for us right right so that they without us they this Heroes of Faith without us should not be made perfect amen right right think about it and brother brah explained it in this manner uh it's right on our screen and I'll read it sture of a perfect man he said you get it those people who died in here are depending and waiting on us right that's how important what God is doing in this revival this word Revival I'm talking about amen so this church has got to come to Perfection Amen in order to bring the resurrection right think about it those people you name it Abraham Moses amen Enoch all those uh Saints amen Elijah Jeremiah Isaiah the great prophets of old amen hallelujah they're waiting for a resurrection amen hallelujah and the dead in Christ that died before us amen you know brother Venom yes is waiting right now he waiting for a resurrection and the church has got to come to perfection in order to bring this Resurrection they are under Souls under the altar waiting for this church to come to its Perfection that's right right that's when Christ does come amen oh my I like that don't you right Hallelujah and then he says in uniting time at time uh uniting time and sign we find now that the time comes when the trumpet sounds and those sleeping Saints back there that could not be made perfect without us right they're depending on us right Hebrews 11 and when they come together they Unite with the living ones the church uniting with the word and then the church and the word uniting together and becoming one the dead saint and the living Saints uniting together to be one and all going together to unite with Christ Yonder for the wedding supper of the Lamb right hallelujah oh my right hallelujah what a wonderful thing that Christ is actually uniting with his bride this has to this has to happen first all the dead Saints they're looking at us watching our lives right right and trying to look at the kind of life that Jesus manifested here on Earth when he was in the flesh right Hallelujah because the Bible said it's going to repeat again in the last days so though so th those that Saints have been watching and looking for this kind of Life Hallelujah I believe this will be the voice The Voice brother said that will call them back to life the voice of Resurrection that will call the dead to rise again hallelujah what is it it's your life it's the kind of life that you're living amen and this is what this message is doing in in our day hallelujah amen it's beginning to manifest that perfect life that Christ had is going to be manifested again yes this is the prophecy for all time Hosea 2: 16 and it shall be at that day what day this day sayth the Lord that you shall call me isy and shall me shall call me no more B and the word isi means husband yeah yep or to P put it in your language today it means sweetheart the day will come when you will call me honey and no more B Al which is Lord or in our present day language it means boss you know everybody's calling him Lord Lord Lord Lord but the time will come you will not call me Lord anymore there's going to be a change in our relationship am it's going to be a closer relationship I would say a more intimate relationship Hallelujah than the father and the son and the Lord the master with the slaves or servants but we're going to be sweethearts GL I'm going to call you my bride amen and you will call me your husband amen not Lord anymore Hallelujah and this should be our emphasis today right our intimacy with the Lord Jesus Hallelujah you see three is a crowd yeah that's right amen so it means a personto person affair with Christ in the privacy of our spiritual bedroom amen right it's not a public show but said that's right the third PO is not a public show that's that's why it will not be made known to everybody in the world right it's only for the bride amen it's not a party with all kinds of commotion taking place in the world but just a quiet impregnation of the Bride hallelujah amen right amen right Hallelujah when the bread of Christ is getting impregnated right right Hallelujah there's silence yeah you don't hear a thing right but there's something happening Glory Hallelujah the world knows nothing about it it's a secret Revival right it's the invisible Union butam calls it of the bride and Christ amen somebody made a joke about it about the bride uniting together you know um that one day the message believer will become so one you know they'll be saying the same thing but somebody said but I don't see it happening yeah yeah and someone else said that's why brother brother bam calls it invisible Union right amen because it will only happen between Christ and the true bride of Christ Glory hallelujah amen it's not going to be a Corporal group no right amen it's not going to be a group Revelation no butram says it all the time when it comes to dealing with Israel he deals with them as a nation as a group now when it comes to dealing with Americans or Filipinos or gentile people he deals with them not as a nation not as a group not even a family this is not a family Revelation this is a individual affair with Jesus Christ Hallelujah Christ revealing himself personally to you not you and your wife it's not even a couple Revelation Hallelujah because the Bible said at that day two will be in a bed one will be taken and one will be left two will be working together while one will be taken and one will be left right so it's an individual Revelation a person to person relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ and you'll not call me Lord anymore Hallelujah because you will be my wife Glory you will be my brother Hallelujah a change in relationship talk about the opening of the word yeah as the seals are broken I see downstairs that you were talking about the seals you know there was big controver versy in our country whether the seals are open or not you know some believe only six Sals are open the seventh is not and I just tell them well let's not argue about it if the seventh seal is not open you believe that the seventh seal is not open it's just not open to you right I mean how can you speak about something that is not open to you right hallelujah amen let's not argue this is only for the bride Glory the one he chose before the foundation of the world to reveal himself Hallelujah that's right completely yeah amen you see as the seals are broken Christ reveals himself and the bride is revealed with him is that all right you know as the more you discover about Christ you discover about yourself right exactly the more you know about the word of God the more you know about yourself who you really are why because when Christ reveals himself he is revealing you too that's right is that amen amen hallelujah that's all right I guess amen we Trace back our inheritance and find out that everything has been fully fully paid for amen yes sir and that there are no incumbrances you know what talks about the title deed and in our country the title deed uh they type something out at the back of it and uh it's called incumbrances like when you mortgate your property it shows how many times you mortgage your property right and it shows how many times it's been paid for right you know it shows they they make Ann notation at the back of the title yeah Hallelujah but praise God I our title dided when anybody examines it when God examines it it's traced back to the very beginning amen amen and and the God looks back looks at the back of the page and he finds out that everything has been stricken stricken off amen right meaning every debt has been paid for right amen amen amen all our sins have gone Glory all our sins are have been paid for yes sir amen you know other Christians believe that Christ paid the down payment and they have to pay the balance in their own lifetime yeah no that's amen he paid the P Price p price hallelujah amen our marriage certificate has been established from the foundation of the world Amen we are the blood of Christ by the spirit that dwells within amen see this is our legal proof of marriage our marriage certificate it's a document that proves you married right amen look at what the prophet said about Merit certificate he said now your name is in the new book right amen not in the Book of Life denominational people they're happy to see their names in The Book of Life but your name is not even found in the book of life but in the Lamb's Book of Life what the lamb redeemed amen not the old book of your natural Union not the old life but your new bride amen amen and Bam gets excited he said Hallelujah your new life is in the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah and that is your marriage certificate hallelujah amen yes sir excuse me for getting excited brother said that's your marriage certificate Hallelujah where your true Eternal germ from the beginning takes hold no you now you're not only forgiven but you've been Justified hallelujah amen oh my amen they look at the back pads and look at the all all the incumbrances all the mortgages all the sins that you've committed and everything has been stricken off Hallelujah you're Justified Hallelujah God did not save you halfway right no God is not like a fisherman who found you drowning in the middle of the lake because you didn't know how to swim and so this fisherman riding on a boat he rescued you and put you on the boat and on the way to the shore you said you should have let me die I don't want to leave and you you insult the fisherman that saved you yeah and so what did the fish fisherman do you aggravated him that's why he takes you and puts you back in the lake yeah now tell me did the fisherman re actually save the person the fisherman did not save you if he put you back right you can't call it save until you reach the shore and God will not be insulted right that's right amen amen God will not be offended amen right no matter what you do if if if he determin to save you he'll save you all the way to the Finish he'll take you all the way to the show Hallelujah he did not save you halfway he did not just pay the down payment he paid everything hallelujah it's this is Grace brother man said meaning you did not deserve it but he saved you anyway and no matter what you do to offend him he will not be offended right because he has been determined it before the foundation of the world your name has been written Hallelujah that's your marriage certificate that's proof that you have been married to the Lord Jesus Christ oh my oh my I don't know you're why you're not excited I am hallelujah praise the Lord that's your marriage certificate amen your new life is your marriage certificate hallelujah look at Genesis chap 2 verse 20-23 and Adam gave names to all cattle and to all the fowls of the air and every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found a help meat for him and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the red which the Lord God had taken from the man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said what's this now this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man see Adam knew I mean he was he just came he just came out of a deep sleep and he sees this beautiful woman beside him right but didn't say who are you you know he he he did not wonder I wonder who this creature is who are you but right away after he seen her he said this is now Bor of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh you came out of me you were taken from my body amen you are woman because you were taken out of me amen hallelujah amen AB now tell me how can Jesus deny you amen right amen if you were taken from the side of Jesus as he was put to sleep at the cross of Calvary Hallelujah now how can he deny you that's right amen how can how can he look at your needs and ignore your needs rightly how can he ignore your feelings right amen there's no way that's right brother amen he'll confess it you came from me amen you are Flesh of My Flesh you're part of me how can I deny you Hallelujah am what I do to you I do to myself right oh my Glory that is why we have an Old Testament Prophet Moses and he wrote in the beginning God cre created the heavens and the Earth right and then we have a new testament Prophet John who wrote In The Book of John in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God Amen but now God gave us a prophet that speaks a prophet that speaks way before the beginning amen he preaches before there ever ever was a beginning before the foundation of the world he always says this in the back of the recesses of God's SM yes and God showed us that the word can discern the very intent of a man's heart by The Prophet's Ministry Hallelujah why is that we were given access to the mind of God by the prophet of Malachi 4 we now have access to the very Mind Of God Amen yes amen hallelujah sir not just what men have written about God but the very Mind Of God what God was thinking amen even before the world was y oh my yes sir hallelujah amen he said this in Hebrews chapter 7 where was Jesus lay at Calvary no sir Jesus was slain before the foundation of the world Behold the Lamb of God that was slain before the foundation of the world God in the beginning when he saw the sin he saw what was happened and then he spoke the word and Jesus was lay before the foundation of the world and every person was saved and every person was saved was saved according to the Bible when the lamb was slain in the mind of God before the foundation of the world Amen you were included in Salvation then oh my this settles it for me yes sir amen I was included in Salvation plan you were included in salvation's plan Hallelujah so what are you going to do about it he pause the question because people think we have something to do with our Salvation right no God did not save you when you attended that camp meeting when when you cried to The Altar and got baptized in water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ no that was not the time when God saved you you were Sav you if you're saved today God Sav you before the foundation of the world hallelujah amen my so God allowed us to access his thoughts of us I am not a nominal Christian that's that's what it thinks of me right yeah I am a virgin I'm not a foolish virgin but I'm a virgin to the word amen I am a wise virgin I have heard the Midnight Cry my lamp has been trimmed and cleared and filled with the oil and I have been adopted and ready to go in the Rapture I belong to Christ Glory I have been dearly purchased his blood bought my full restoration Glory Hallelujah this was what God had in mind I I put here your your profile in the Lamb's Facebook yeah yeah you have a profile picture and God was the one who took it not your neighbor took it not your pastor took it but God took that picture right but said now in other words when you become a young man or a young woman God takes a picture of you and then he expounds said so in that picture I don't think you were smoking in that picture you were committing uh adultery in that picture no no you were not in drugs right or any of that thing you were not wearing Min skirts you were not wearing uh slacks and makeup when God took a picture of you it was a perfect picture of what you really are amen right Hallelujah when did this happen before the foundation of the world he already took a picture of you and then he said I don't care what they would do with you I don't care what they would do with you they cannot destroy that profile hallelujah oh my people are shocked if I if I showed him this code because you God has a gallery up in heaven and he stores our pictures profile pictures he said God's that picture in God's Great Gallery up there it cannot destroy it right because it's in heaven you could burn it up meaning whatever you do to this body you can burn it you can feed it to Lions you can feed it to the Lions do it anyway you want to it will come forth again just ass sure as two and two is four just ass sure as God spoke it it will come forth no matter where you are Hallelujah whether in the Philippines or in the USA Hallelujah when God speaks sir that body will rise hallelujah amen yes sir even those that are alive and remain amen they will be chains in the twinkling of Hallelujah am change into into that profile picture yes sir think about it a perfect image right a perfect body not having to check the blood sugar all the time and and inject insulin you know take blood pressure pills you don't have to do that brother Day none of that Hallelujah because amen God will give us a new brand new body what kind of body like the one that was uh that he took a picture of you a perfect body before the foundation of the world Hallelujah so we're talking about the persecutions that can come amongst Believers and it's a sad news but I have to share it with you you're talking about what if this happens and that happens and and they they uh The Squeeze happens and they persecute our families and churches we have two ministers in mindo in Philippine islands that have been shot to dead dead one of them was shot while preaching think of it while preaching Sunday morning not just to his assembly but it was a joint uh joint meeting several churches five or six five or six Church churches in the area came together and he preached that morning so people were thinking uh because two men on a motorcycle wearing shorts they came down and one stayed outside as a lookout and one came in and started shooting shooting the the minister preaching from the pulpit and the first bullet hit him but he you would think he would stop because he was down but he went near close behind the pulpit and shut some more seven more shots before all the Believers talk about squeeze yeah but I told the family because they were all complaining you know and saying you know he took the message how come this all God allowed this to happen to him right so I said I wish that happened to me yeah because that means I I won't have any more any worry I was killed in the line of dudy k i e killed in action amen hallelujah right in the line of Judy right what better way to die Hallelujah but pray for that church we're helping the Widow we're helping the people kind of uh hold themselves together you know and the church is still going you know the church is still holding Ste steady a brother uh took his place the brother's place and uh the church is actually growing now amen so they're saying they're still investigating the case that they're saying some this must be some communist rebels and they were targeting the pastor of the place so whoever the Assassin was thought maybe that the one preaching behind the pulpit was the pastor yeah but he was not the pastor of the church you know he was just asked to speak in the joint Fellowship joint service and then the other minister was shot while having breakfast at this cafeteria he has a little cafeteria and he was shot close G Reigns and he died right there two message ministers last year this happens at the end of the year Hallelujah but baham said I don't care what they do to that body amen you couldn't burn it you couldn't feed it to LS do it any way you want to it will come forth again as soon as two and two is four just as sure as God spoke it it will come forth yes sir amen right so I hope you are seeing the revealing of the right brother BR spokes about spoke about the bride age yes amen after the church ages is gone is over then the bride a a comes to be and uh there's a lot of sense to it I don't think we are in we are a part of Le we are in the age of leoda but we definitely are not lukewarm we're not blind and naked amen we don't consider ourselves self-sufficient right we're depending on the Lord amen in our every need hallelujah we're not Le oia leoda Leia is not going to make it to the Rapture they'll be left behind brother right hallelujah amen so brother spoke about the bride AIDS and this is what I'm talking about the bride AIDS what is what is God doing in the bride AIDS what is God doing in our midst today amen right let me just remind you people they like to talk about what God is going to do in the future and what God has done in history that's right but they cannot notice they not they are ignoring what God is presently doing today right and I'm telling you God is presently doing a work today right in our midst right in this time Hallelujah wherever the bride of Christ is this you see the hand of God moving working Hallelujah he's doing something and the world doesn't have an idea one iota of idea that's right what's happening why because the bride is having a word Revival sir I like that the word Revival it's not a Revival of Miracles it's not a Revival of great crowds super churches but it's a word Revival amen hallelujah as Christ reveals himself he reveals the bride with him am look at this proving his word brother said not no more as a church see not no more the bride is called and he said in in preaching the seals the first seal I understand he said I will not call you church anymore so that you will understand I now call you the bride Hallelujah so the bride is called see in that day that the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the head that's the purpose that's the purpose of go God calling out a bride from the church to unite the marriage of the Bride the bridegroom will come right out through this when the son of man will come down and and come in human flesh to unite the two together the church has to be the word right it will take the ministry of Malachi 4 a man with human flesh and Christ manifesting himself through that man amen exactly right and the purpose is to unite to unite the bride and to unite the bride with Christ the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down through and come in human flesh to unite the two together the church has to be the word Glory he is the word and the two unite together and to do that it will take the Manifest manifestation of the revealing of the son of man am man this is what God is doing God is redeeming revealing who the son of man is manifestation of sons Hallelujah we'll talk about that later not a clergy man I don't know do you see what I mean see it's a son of man Jesus Christ right will come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word

be the word am in order for them to be United together amen oh my right amen and after you United with the word and this life comes to manifestation yeah this is the kind of life that the saints that are that went ahead of us that died before us in Christ the dead in Christ they were looking for this kind of life and when they they see it being manifested on Earth that means it's time for them to go back to Earth and take on bodies and their Resurrection will take place the dead in Christ will rise first and then we which are alive and remain amen will be changed and be will'll be taken up together to meet them meet the Lord in the air oh I love that am I love that don't you now this here what God is doing now is claiming time this is claiming time time right he claims what he has redeemed 2,000 years ago he redeemed every everyone that has been listed in that book he redeemed all of them right right you know if you redeem something from the pawn shop you have to come up with the money that they they're asking you to pay and if you come up with with the right amount of money you pay them the the the required amount and you don't leave after you pay them the money what do you do you take back what is your own amen you take back what has been pawned right amen after you paid the money then you take what is yours oh my and brother said this listen to this and now if you

Spirit am oh my I cannot emphasize it enough right you are in him and sealed in there by the holy spirit amen and then he said and now if you were in the quickening oh my if you were in the quickening at his beginning that's what he come to redeem am and your name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life in his thinking at the beginning and he come to redeem all the name that's been in that book no more not one more just what's in there amen when the last name is redeemed he takes the book glory and claims what he has redeemed oh my goodness this is what God is doing today he's not claiming what he has already redeemed I'm trusting you're one of them amen I'm trusting your senior place in the great plan of God Amen he's not claiming every predestinated seed amen manifestation of sons we'll talk about it now now all things had been brought coming shaping up to a headstone to the manifestation of sons of God coming back amen and the spirit of God coming into this man yeah right spirit of God coming into this man not not a man singular but this amen hallelujah so perfectly until their Ministry not just brother Venom's Ministry but their ministry will be so close like Christ until it will join him and his church together oh my Hallelujah I say the Earth is in a tantum right sure you know a child you know being on a tantrum why is the child in a tantrum yeah he's looking for somebody to control him yeah right man sure amen and the Tantrum will not cease until he finds that someone who can control him right hallelujah amen Romans chapter 8 verse 19- 24 I I don't believe it's in the slide but let me just read it for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of sons of God we're talking about manifestations of sons now Hallelujah for the creature was made subject to bity not willingly but by reason of him who was subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corrup ction into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation grown it and travail it in pain together until now until when until now right so no matter what the Green Peace says about it or does about it bam said said it already he has spoken it already this world is falling apart sir there's no way to correct what is happening now in this world all the pollution all the crime and the immorality that's taking place there's no way to correct it hallelujah we're just waiting for the manif manifestation of sons yeah because only the sons of God can could control this world only true children of God can truly control this world come on Jesus spoke and the waves were ComEd amen amen and and and the wind Stood Still Jesus spoke and the tree was dried up to the roots Hallelujah and better says he just spoke and that storm came back from where it came from went back to where it came from hallelujah what is it a Son of God manifesting itself Son of God manifesting the very life of God hallelujah because that's how we should be in this world we should be in full control of everything Glory we should be able to speak Hallelujah and things will start happening on brother that is what God is doing Hallelujah that is this is what God is doing today positionally placing you the bride of Christ on in where you should be come on right you should be in a place where you canol control the elements of this world come on brother Hallelujah so whatam speaks about the Joshua Commission because Moses after God took him off the scene then he replaced him with Joshua there was a change in administration change in leadership so you believe brother B is our Moses today he led us out of Egypt land different denominations but he wasn't able to get us to the promised land and God took him away now it's time for Joshua to come in on yeah Hallelujah and when he preached his last sermon his last sermon was called entitled the leadership he pointed us to our true leader he did not point us to a great man a great teacher he did not point us to an E Messenger to some Prophet no he said our leader today is the Holy Ghost oh my amen he even said our Joshua today is the Holy Ghost Hallelujah am in the lives of people that have caught the message of Moses and they stayed with the Moses with the uh with the message of Moses remember the Joshua commission stay with the message of Moses right amen the message is not for CED people people that are afraid no the Lord said be of good courage Hallelujah take Moses message you take this law and don't deviate from it to the left or to the right Hallelujah but just stay with it amen as I was with Moses so shall I be with you amen amen hallelujah our Joshua today is the holy ghost in the life of every believer under the leadership of the five-fold ministry that's our Moses today amen you see Moses Ministry was a onean ministry that's why everybody had to look to Moses you know Moses raises his hands and they win the battle but you see Moses was a man and he goes weary and he puts down his hand and they lose the b battle but they have to see Moses you know yeah Moses had to be strong for the people because they were all looking at him because it was a oneman Ministry there's nobody like Moses in all the land right Hallelujah but Joshua's Ministry is different amen you know Joshua kind of organized the people you know the priest first with the Ark of the Covenant and then the tribes you know in order with the leaders and then the M musicians have their place amen and so uh Joshua when he came to the promised plan then he gave them their inheritance they positionally placed them in the promised land amen and I believe that is what God is doing today Glory positionally placing you yes sir Hallelujah in the body of Christ Hallelujah right somebody was talking to me about church order and uh he thinks it's wonderful that they have teaching on Church order don't get me wrong we talk about church order too I teach church church order in my church but I told the brother really brother Church order was meant for unruly Believers amen Church order was made for immature Christians that's right that don't know how to conduct themselves in the church but you come to that maturity you get the Holy Ghost nobody has to tell you what to do you know your right place you know just what to do when to do it amen because you know your place in the word that's right and this is what Joshua is doing now our Joshua today the holy spirit is positionally placing you in your rightful position in the body of Christ you know where I find problems arise is because there's a lot of people in the Mage so-called magees that don't know their rightful place that's right right song leaders that are trying to Pastor pastors that are trying to evangelize amen sisters that are trying to control how the church is going to be managed and administered you have to be in your right place and that's the reason the message came to us is to positionally place us as the rightful place our rightful place in the word hallelujah the ministry of the Bride is a body Ministry now that's right amen listen to this Christ The Mystery of God revealed Christ is made manifest in the bride look God in his body Christ and Christ in his body the bride oh my I don't know why you're not excited this is exciting my brothers and sisters look God in his body Christ and Christ in his body right the bride oh my God made manifest in Christ but the story doesn't end there he said Christ made manifest in the bride this is what's taking place right now that's right and people outside don't realize it I guess even people inside don't realize it but I'm excited exed to see this am then and as God took from the body of Adam the woman and she fell then God has took the body of Christ in his flesh his body which is his word and is bringing a bride out that won't fall by denomination or Creed no sir but she is coming back with a pure anad alterated word of God being manifested amen that's right glory to God Amen look at Isaiah chapter 62 verse 5 for as a Young Man marries a virgin so shall thy Sons marry thee and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride shall the the thy God Rejoice over thee Oh my oh my aren't you happy that God is thrilled about you God is excited right amen amen you look at the wedding and you you watch the the uh the reaction of the Bride you know she she's all too excited Hallelujah but you look at the groom he's as he's just as excited as the bride and think about it you think we can't wait to see the Lord this scripture tells me that God can't can't wait to be United with the bride of Christ Hallelujah he's excited over us think about it Hallelujah yes sir Hebrews 12:2 looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy I highlighted it so you you see the joy that was placed before him what do you think is the joy that was placed before him and which was the reason why he endured the CL cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God what's the joy that was placed before him that gave him such inspiration Hallelujah to defy death Hallelujah it's the bride amen the bride of Christ yes sir amen hallelujah Psalms 139 and verse 17 and 18 this will blow your mind but that's all right how precious also are thy thoughts unto me oh God this is David speaking to God right how precious are thy thoughts about me you know we think about God but think about it God is thinking about you right oh God how great is the sum of them if I should count them they are more in number than the sand when I awake I am still with thee am oh my tell me about you can you can talk to me about depression if you read this verse right amen you know you're too blessed to be depressed you're too anointed to be disappointed am we have a place called boraka in the Philippines one of the islands what's special about Baka is the great beach beach beach front and it's got uh white sand you know almost as white as just brought a shirt there and you know what you do go to barakai some time and take with you like a cup and scoop a sand of that white white sand white white Beach into that cup and start start getting one one grain of sand after the other and think of the wonderful thoughts God has have thought about you yeah I am beautiful I have been washed of my sins I have been forgiven I have been Justified you name it right and I have been chosen before the foundation of the world Hallelujah I am the apple of his eye Glory I'm a special creature nobody's like me in all the world Hallelujah right and then after you empty the the cup of sand then you do it again again and do it again and do it again about the 10th time and you won't be able to exhaust the number of Sands of the sea and that's why David said it's more than the number of the grains of Sands in the sea amen oh my think about that think about it God thinks highly of you this is a strong passionate love that God has towards the bride amen this is a this this love is stronger than the love that he has for a child who was shamed and suffered and died on the cross you see he could have easily saved his son from dying but there something was something constrained him it was a greater force than a love for a child his own son and that's his love for bride for the bride of Christ his love for the bride of Christ that's why in the Old Testament that's the law it culminates in God manifesting In the Flesh at the end of the Old Testament this the Old Testament right at the end of it we see Christ coming to being amen right Jesus appearing right because he is the culmination of the law Hallelujah God shows us that Jesus was the very idea of the law he fulfilled the law right but let me tell you something else Grace came in after Jesus came on the scene but at the end of the grace this is the time that we're living in at the end of grace before Jesus comes again to Earth again to meet the bride the bride will come to being Glory right amen right Hallelujah Grace is the male part oh the law is the male part I should say and Grace is the female part am male and female together right amen hallelujah we'll we'll come together at the end oh my well we talked about this already so I won't be repeating it I want to to look at the orange orange slide denom nationalism you know we talked about brandham Tabernacle right uh uh excommunicating people that don't believe the way that they do right brother bam said but the system not the man he clarifies it now not the man not the people but the system winds them around and separates them from other brothers they cannot do this with the system that they're in they're they're under and won't forbid permit them to do it that's what I'm against Brethren I wouldn't want you to misunderstand I know that that's God's truth and I know the thing has to die every type Shadow even the scripture itself proves it's able ab's Grace Hallelujah proves it he said it in Abraham's Grace Covenant you see it's not the people in the denomination that's the reason we still go to them brother brother Wade when brother Wade went to uh Puerto Princessa with me we got more than 100 ministers about 150 ministers denominational ministers and we preach to them the message of the hour amen hallelujah and out of that I think there's uh over a dozen maybe 15 ministers that we now gather every month I go there every month to tell them more about the message hallelujah amen but said it's not this it's not the men the people in there there there are uh great people in there if you think of it where did you come from Hallelujah there's God's people in every one of them amen they just need to hear the voice for this day that's right Hallelujah right so brother is not against the people he's against the system Glory now look at this quotation now and then maybe I'll close you know after a few clouds a a few more slides in The Message Church ages seven Church ages paragraph 204 now now that's the Bible that's what the spirit says see the candlesticks all right now the 13th verse said and in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like the son of man and then he expounds what one like him who was this now we've always been thought and we all know that this was Christ right this was Christ the one walking in the middle of the in the midst of the candlesticks this was Christ no doubt right amen but who was this but said his bride amen one like him what's now it was clothed with a garment down to the foot the Holiness of Jesus Christ covering her he was has washed us from our sins with his own blood right all right good about the paps a pops is a woman's breast not a man brother says it's a woman amen with a golden girdle the gospel that held the power and the glory of God over the body of Christ hallelujah hallu oh my I thought in the beginning this was a mistake this was this was one of those uh people saying that brother bam thought something wrong and I I I thought surely this was a mistake because we all know that this was Jesus Christ but he said it's not Jesus Christ it's one like him who is it it's the bride of Christ Hallelujah that has become like him hallelujah thank you Jesus look he said Christ the M mystery of God God In His holy body no uh I think we we've gone through that okay this one sir we would see Jesus now here you are a person I'm preaching the word saying that he's not dead he's alive he's alive and promis to identify himself in our flesh our human flesh like he did back there see all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into to the church that's him Christ in us hallelujah what about this statement invisible Union of the Bride he said can't you see where we're standing life is in the grain again what is it just exactly like the same grain that went into the ground the same Jesus in the bright form Jesus in the bright form can you say that with me Jesus in The Bride form amen but said same power right same church GL same thing same word Hallelujah Jesus in bright form glory amen the first to come to maturity as Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth all as although type in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bride that's right Amen in the bride coming of Christ right in the bride coming of Christ This is a another message terminology that the denominational ministers know nothing about you know I talked to them one time you know I I slept and I said during the bright coming of Christ and they were wondering what is that yeah what is the bride coming of Christ Hallelujah but brother Brandon says it clearly in the bride coming of Christ the coming out of the church they will have to be a sheep waved again in the last days oh my the waving of the sheep what was the Sheep the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat that proved it was a sheep right sister Peggy said something last night when we were fellow shipping and I heard her say you know if it's true that the Lord is coming soon now what are we what have we done about it yeah and I asked the same question amen you know this is supposed to be the bright coming of Christ this is the bride AIDS the church AIDS is over right we're now in a special age right at the very uh ending of days right when time blends with eternity right Hallelujah this is where we're living right now amen hallelujah this is the bright coming of Christ and then he said rising of the sun Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was bed over the people and the first time there will come forth for the bright aids for the resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the for maturity of the word has has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the People by the same signs and wonders that he did back there this is what God is doing right now exactly people Believers are experiencing the greatest Revival Hallelujah ever known to man Glory
