we thank you for your grace and mercy to us this morning we just ask lord that you'll bless our study of the word as we dive into these things lord and bless brother way lord as he's back there studying lord grant that lord that you'll give us a day lord to meet our expectations lord we ask your blessing now in your name amen so hebrews chapter six verses four to six if you maybe just follow along in your bible this morning we're just gonna um try making our way to hebrews chapter seven where paul begins to talk about melchizedek and um you know a lot of the things paul says is is like peter would say a little bit difficult to understand but really the theme of of chapter six is is um he he is you need to be pointing it and he's so he's saying in verse four he says for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from god but that which beareth thorns and briars is rejected and is nigh unto cursing whose end is to be burned now a lot of times ministers as we study these things out what we're what we're doing is we're hunting we go we go hunting for um for like clinching quotes and clenching scriptures because you know paul says it in a way it's kind of hard maybe to to grasp initially um but you know so i you know i i had a slide to show the quote from hebrews chapter six that i think really clinches what paul is talking about here where brother adam said see what he's talking about now this is in the sermon hebrews chapter six that where brother brown was preaching on this uh this this scripture this this chapter he said see what he's talking about he's not talking about christians falling away impossible to come back he's talking about carnal believers who grow who go through the form of reformation but he said to you who was born again you who are christian beloved we are persuaded later on in chapter six you'll read he says we are persuaded better things of you of a christian he's you're persuaded to keep going on to not just stop at justification and not just stop a sanctification but to keep going on that's right to not because uh he he doesn't want to see see thorns and thistles born of you but to actually see that the fruit of the doctrine that you've received that christ is manifested in your flesh yeah that's what that's what god is looking to see in a born-again christian's life to you who was born again you who are christian beloved we are persuaded better things of you you don't say those things you don't live that type of life you're secured with christ and so in the pergamian church age he said and there it is you can't claim that manifestation is the evidence of being spirit born spirit-filled no sir i will admit that true manifestation is the evidence of the holy spirit doing mighty acts but it is not the evidence of the individual being spirit-filled even though that individual has an abundance of those manifestations the evidence of receiving the holy ghost today is just the same as it was back in the day of the lord amen it is receiving the word of truth for the day in which you live jesus never did stress the importance of the work says he did the word he knew that if the people got the word the works would follow so we don't put the cart before the horse we won't we won't we don't want to try to force something but if you receive the word i said what's happening when you receive the word the word is is taking a hold of your life and changing your life and producing christ in your life and so you know a lot of people you'll try to i'm i want to get rid of this thing in my life i want to get get rid of iniquity what's going to get rid of iniquity mercy and truth because as you receive the word it drives out everything that's unclean and it begins to change your thinking and change the way that you act and change your life and it's an automatic process because as you receive the word it's going to have that effect in your life so in luke chapter 13 to just kind of uh piggyback off of that that that that down in your soul there could be something wrong even though you're anointed in your spirit that's what jesus was talking about in luke chapter 13 verses 23 to 26 when he said when someone asked him sin then said unto him lord are there few that be saved and he said unto them strive to enter into the straight gate for many i say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able when once the master of the house is risen up and shut to the door and you begin to stand without and to knock at the door saying lord lord open unto us and he shall answer and say unto you i know you not whence ye are then shall ye begin to say we have eaten and drunk in thy presence and now has taught in our streets but he shall say i tell you i know you not when you are depart from me all ye workers of iniquity and we've been kind of diving into iniquity because that's this is really it goes along with what paul is talking about he's he's saying you need to be born again and being born again will drive out the iniquity from your soul where brother brown would say he'd say what is iniquity is something that you know that's right and you concede it and won't do it in your heart in your heart so that's where we're dealing the problem is your heart problem when jesus began to magnify the law and say that if you just look upon a woman with lust in your heart there's something wrong in your heart and so we want to get our problem right in our heart man how do you get the problem right in your heart by mercy and truth by receiving the word that changes your heart yes when you know that the bible teaches a certain thing and you won't do it that's iniquity and brother brown would say every man knows that he's got to be born again by the spirit of god you've got to receive the holy ghost so again that's what paul is talking about in hebrews chapter six i i'm maybe using a lot of repetition because i want the next time you go back and read the book of hebrews and you read the book of hebrews chapter six and you're you see what paul's talking about here that god has persuaded better things of you and that he uh by these two immutable things that paul's talking about a seed that he's talking about being born again have tasted of the good word of god and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall again to renew them again unto repentance seeing that crucified in themselves the son of god affection put him to an open shame somebody that knew what they needed to do and wouldn't do it that you need to be born again and we used before the example of nicodemus where jesus will sit there and talk to him and say you need to be born again but where was he on the day of pentecost and i i i wish i could pull this slide up and show this because these i i wanted to rehash some of these things that brother dale had said in the past that iniquity is the conceiving part of it the baby is the product the baby is what's brought forth an iniquity iniquity is that crooked thing that that's got your heart messed up an iniquity and he'd say we've already seen we were products of iniquity now listen to this now the new birth took care of the iniquity for our soul made a way for the body to be redeemed but the body is not yet redeemed yet it's still a product of iniquity so you get the iniquity taking care of your in your soul and yet there's still some things that have to be dealt with so he said again unless you're born again unless you are a christian you are totally a product of iniquity your soul is doomed for a devil's hell now again that's what paul paul is talking about a problem in somebody's soul that yeah you feel an anointing on your flesh but what's sown down in your heart what have you received what what you feel a lot of things you might feel like uh something on your flesh or something move in your spirit but have you received the word for your day and there's a lot of scriptures in the bible that talk about iniquity problems in people's problems in people's decision-making problems in people's ability to receive the word and to walk in it like job 34 that said there is no darkness nor shadow of death where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves in psalm 14 it says have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat up my people as they eat bread and call not upon the lord that's a pretty pretty uh interesting description of a worker of iniquity not having any knowledge no understanding and don't call on the lord don't have a relationship with god psalm 37 a psalm of david fret not thyself because of evildoers neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity don't don't any see that's a problem many times some people that that that come to church and and are trying to be a christian they start looking at other people and and envy the people that you you're we're trying to escape the bonds of the earth the bonds of the flag we're trying to escape the pride of life and to look out and at people the workers of iniquity and to be envious of them that's what uh david is warning us here in psalm 37 fret not thyself because of evil doers don't be envious against the workers of iniquity the way of the lord in proverbs chapter 10 the way of the lord is the strength to the upright but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity psalm 28 says draw me not away with the wicked and with the workers of iniquity which speak peace to their neighbors but mischief is in their hearts so where what's what's the iniquity that the scripture is is pointing out to us that that if you're kind to your neighbors and you're on the out on outwardly you look like um you're being nice and it looks like you're good a good person but on the inside there's something crooked and out of place that's what iniquity is that crooked thing that's got you messed up from your birth that the only antidote to is is the word of god and so luke chapter 13 says but he shall depart i tell you i know you not when she are depart from me all you workers of iniquity and and second thessalonians goes to goes on to say remember you not that when i was yet with you i told you these things and now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity that's already work only he who now let us let what's he talking about again the holy ghost until he be taken out of the way because when the holy ghost is taken out of the way then that mystery of iniquity will be revealed then you'll see what iniquity really is it's a mystery what a mystery is something that's not quite quite seen in its fullness yet it's a mysterious thing but as as we understand the word the the myst the mysterious part of it is taken away so again in leadership brother and would say many of you think i got the baptism of the holy ghost i'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven no sir you can have the baptism of the holy ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell the bible says so and that's that quote that stumbled many people over the years i've talked to many people that were that were tripped up by that quote and did not understand that and stumbled but i think by when you read hebrews chapter 6 it enlightens that and you can begin to understand that you can have the holy ghost in your spirit and but not receive the word for your day and i i i i want to just nail this down before we get into the two immutable things because this is this is what paul is talking about it may be a hard to understand way but you must be born again and the anointed ones at the end time he said what is iniquity he said ask somebody it's something that you know you ought to do and you won't do it they know that word they hear it you're listening to this tape you're listening to this message you see the lord god say so you see him confirm it make it true and you know this just as plain as the sun is shining outside but you that'll hold on to your denomination hold on to those false things you worker of iniquity let me read this one last quote before we before we keep moving on in hebrews chapter six he said now you can be all worked up in emotion by speaking in tongues shouting jerking shaking running up and down the aisle nothing against that but you can make yourself believe that you're saved when you're not you're not saved your life will prove what you are jesus said it would by their fruit she shall know them your life will prove whether you're saved or not if you never open your mouth it'll prove what you are but all this work up and emotion and joining church and i've been baptized in jesus name hallelujah i know i got it that doesn't mean nothing i've been baptized named father son holy ghost face forward three times i got it that means nothing paul said let's go on to perfection now we're talking about perfected and if we run this down you'll find out the perfected is the elected so you know in that quote he said your life will prove what you are and my contention has always been that there's really those two evidences of the new birth faith and works that faith is your your revelation of the word but it's going to produce a life that's why in john chapter 10 he said if jesus said if i do not the works of my father believe me not but if i do though you believe not me believe the works that ye may know and believe that the father is in me and i in him so if that's how you knew that the father was in jesus that's how you'll know that the father is in us because it has transformed their life and the things that you used to do you don't do them anymore in james chapter 2 james said thou believers that there is one god thou doest well the devils also believe and tremble but wilt thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead so brother ram is saying your life will prove whether you're saved or not if you never open your mouth mouth that'll prove what you are because outwardly you come to church and you read your bible and you're paying your tithes and you're doing the things that a christian does and it proves that something's changed on the inside so let's back up and read and to get kind of get where we are in hebrews chapter 6. if you've got your bible you can follow along from verse 1 therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward god or the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment and this will we do of god permit for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh off upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed received with a blessing from god but that which beareth thorns and briars is rejected and deny into cursing whose end is to be burned but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak for god is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which ye have shown toward his name and that ye minister to the saints and do minister and we desire that every one of you to show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope until the end what's paul saying is that keep stay diligent and and be keep keeping your consistency and uh keep keep pressing forward say he says in verse 12 that you be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises for when god made promise to abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself now now think think about this when i i i many times we we'll make a promise to one another i'm going gonna be at your house next tuesday or whatever i'm gonna i'm i'm gonna be we're gonna go and we're gonna do something or whatever and then then it rains a thunderstorm will come up maybe your car breaks down so us in our humanity we we make promises and things we we try to keep and we want to keep we're not that even what we're lying but we just in our humanity that we can't keep but here's a god god that can when he says something he's going to make it come to pass a god think about a god when god says something he's he cannot lie right so the bible's saying forgot when god made promise to abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing i will bless thee and multiplying out will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise now that that promise that that that that that god made to abraham was back there in genesis chapter 22 and all through the the story of abraham because god kept reiterating his promise and he'd say he said in genesis chapter 22 verse 16 and by myself have i sworn saith the lord for because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy son that only son but if you drop down to verse 18 you'll see how the promise that he made to abraham has got you wrapped into it because he made a promise to the seed of abraham and he said and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice so he made a promise to abraham that he was going to carry him through you see how the whole theme of this chapter of hebrews chapter 6 is you've got to be born again and when you're born again it carries there's some promises that are wrapped up in there that that gives you a hope that you can anchor your soul to that you can anchor everything to if you look in the bible and see the impact of these promises that god has made that will give you hope and assurance and and the way that the way that he got god didn't just say it in this case but he gave two immutable things that we could have confidence with now listen as we read on that as paul said he said for men verily swear by the greater because you always you got to make an oath by something greater than yourself and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife wherein god willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath now what immutability means is something that no matter what you do to it you cannot change it it's kind of hard to even envision imagine something that's immutable because you take a rock wall and you chip on it long enough and you're gonna chip off little flecks of it but immutability means you can't change it so a a a granite wall maybe you'd be able to change it over time if the wind and the rain washed away at it long enough but but we're talking about a a god that his counsel is so immutable that it no matter what it will never change it cannot be changed when god says something is is unchanging so he says by wearing god willing more abundantly to show into the areas of promise the immutability of his council confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us so we got two things and what two things can we look into the scripture and see and and hang on to brother brown would say we have two things yes first his word said he would do it so when he made a promise that he's going to carry you through and when he made a promise that he's going to give you the holy ghost if you'll just believe him he's going to carry through with it the second was his sworn oath on it so just to make it double confirmed he swore an oath on top of that on top of the fact that god cannot lie he made an oath on top of that so you've got a double confirmation it's a brother i said he would do it to know this that god has promised us by a sworn oath one that he cannot lie god cannot lie and the other he swore an oath on top of that and what was it so now brother brown is bringing it over into the new testament that he will raise us up at the last day and give us eternal life so you see how your your story is wrapped up in the promise that god gave to abraham god made an uh an oath to abraham to that he was gonna that his seed would bless the whole world that that his all your seed will be as the stars of heaven and abraham standing out there on the sand looking up at the stars and not maybe not even realizing what truly that meant that one day on the day of pentecost god would fill men and women with the baptism of the holy ghost and that promise would go throughout all the world why because god made a promise and confirmed it by an oath and we have two immutable things that we can look to with confidence now brother ram said in jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he said father god he was praying a prayer he said it is most solemnly that we come to the you have declared yourself you're not guilty of your promise anymore you made it true for the bible said that god cannot lie the immutable things god cannot lie and god swore that he would do it if we could only believe it then we see jesus said this morning in the reading that the scriptures cannot be broken so brother rahm said in and he swore by himself he said god made an oath promised abraham and swore by himself that i'll save you and your seed after you what is the seed of abraham now who is the one that's got this sure hold who was the one that's built on this foundation not just every tom dick and harry not all that saith to me lord lord will enter in but the one that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven and this is the father's will this is his word and you see how everything in that chapter ties together that he's saying just because you feel an anointing or something that that's not that's not a sure anchor but when you've got a revelation of the word and you're walking in the wheel in the father's will then you you're tied back into those two immutable things that god made a promise that he'll never leave you that he'll fill you with the holy ghost and that will carry you through despite all the problems that abraham had despite all the all the problems with those old testament saints god carried him through because he gave an unconditional covenant and that's what the baptism the holy ghost is when god gives you that promise he'll carry you through to despite all of your faults all of your failings he'll he's going to carry you through because he made a promise and in hebrews chapter 6 verse chapter 2 uh chapter 6 number two that brother and priest he said and uh the musicians can go ahead and come forward we'll we'll close on this on this quote he said notice god made a promise to abraham unconditional and now wait abraham did not have to do one thing god said i have already done it god made a promise to adam said adam if you'll not touch this you'll live forever but the day you eat there oh that day you die adam said i just wonder what's all about anyway he goes over and he's at tampering every time that god made a man makes his covenant with god or god with a man the man breaks his part so god had to do something because he's seen what man was and they were for ordained they were elected and god had to do something so god came down and made his covenant with abraham unconditionally if it wouldn't have been unconditionally abraham would have been lost a long time that's what paul is talking about that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us we'll stop right there god bless you [Applause] [Music] you
