35    Notice, He is saying, that, "I have obtained this faith, and I'm addressing this to them that has obtained the like precious faith." I want... It's not to the outside world. This is to the Church, see, those that are in Christ.
Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and (through) of Jesus Christ our Lord,
According as his divine power has given unto us all things... his divine power now has given unto us all things that pertain unto life... godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue:
Whereby are we given unto... given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these (these promises) we might be partakers of the divine nature,...
«  36       †          Now let that soak real deep now. Not preaching this morning; we just teaching this lesson. "Divine nature." Let me read that 4th verse again now, so you won't miss it. "Whereby we are given..."
Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these (these promises) we might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.
37    See, "the world," we've escaped that now. He's addressing this to the Church. That's why we're here this morning, is to find out what is the way, what is God's requirement. There's not a person in here, that loves God, but wants to--wants to become more like Christ. Now it's laid out here. Every Christian!

«  94       †          Well, now that's the way it is, trying to--to manufacture Christianity. You can't do it. The first thing you've got to do, is be born again. You've got to be changed. See? And when you're changed, you become a new creation. Now you're getting right, now. See? Now you don't have to worry about the feathers, i...

remember the old um used to see it on the walls a lot of times it was one set of footprints down the beach and the question was Lord why did you leave me in the time of my of my great need and he said they said no it's only one set of footprints he said well I was carrying you yep I was carrying you at that time son daughter I was one that was doing the work so if we let's let go and let God let him do the work then we'll be in a lot better shape good to be back in the house with the Lord good to have each and every one of you back with us remember the ones that are still traveling the ones that are sick um brother Joe said sister Gwen uh had covered so uh he had just got over it um and she has it now so we're just going to pray she's on the backside of it I think so everything should be fine so just keep them in your prayers as the devil wants to destroy us but God said no not until I get done with you until I'm finished with him I'm not going to get you're not going to go any quicker than you supposed to amen you're going to go when God's finished with you and we want to go when God's finished with us amen don't want to hang around because remember what happened to Hezekiah God gave him 15 more years and he kind of messed up a little bit a man should have went on when God said in this time for you to leave let's remember now by way of announcement real quick we'll have communion foot washing in just a little while brother Louise will be speaking for us Wednesday night uh on the 10th there'll be a prayer service here at the church at seven o'clock in the

we'll go over there at four o'clock for the wedding so God bless you we love you with the love of the Lord thank you for all the prayers and different things that we're we're going through and and we appreciate all prayers and we pray for you every day every day we we try to uh I can't mention you all by names but sure we try to that was one thing uh brother Cauley always um amazed me not the brother Carla couldn't remember but it amazed me there'd be 15 prayer requests now if you give me 15 prayer requests I'm going to say Lord Jesus I thank you for bringing these requests and I pray that you'll administer to each one of them and I'm you know I'm pretty much I can't brother Colin name every one of them what it was can you still do that probably not doubt it he said but but but when I first started coming back to church he was just it was just a mystery to me that he could remember all 15 or 20 prayer requests and he could name him everyone and I appreciate that amen it's lovely to have your name called amen especially a Christian man called your name Christian sister call your name so let's turn into Bibles let's get to uh first John but let me read the this quote right here in Christ The Mystery of God reveal we were talking this morning about Heavenly places oh how I wish I had time here I've got it marked right here in my Bible about Heavenly places what is Heavenly places Heavenly places just for a moment is the believer's position in Christ where the believer stands in Christ in Heavenly places so let's read Ephesians 2 Verse 6 and he hath raised us up all right now look where are we going we're going up the statue of perfect man so he has raised us up the believer's position there's a position we come to in here because we're going to look later on that inside even all this inside of all this there's positions that you come to okay and we know it's coming to adoption but we got to come to a place to where we write the check we write the check amen where the believer stands in Christ and have to raise us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace and his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus let's bow our heads Lord thank you for the day that you give us we appreciate the group of people that you've assembled here today Lord that we can speak to Father the cream of the crop the greatest people that ever stood on the face of the Earth my many people would love to maybe meet a sports star or a or a movie star or a race car driver or something it would be really important for them to eat their picture thinking with them or or get a signed autograph of a baseball or something like that but Lord to stand in the presence of your children to stand in the presence of the cream of the crop the Hall of Famers this is it right here this is the one that's going to make it and father I pray that you'd help us a little bit more today to to gather ourselves together and be a little more a little more attentive to you and be Lord that we can climb up this statue of a perfect man together not leave anyone behind but reach back and grab somebody and not step over them and try to get as the world would say that they would burn Bridges let's not burn Bridges let's P let's pull people across and bring them with us Lord we pray that you just bless us now and take care of us in the furthermore this service in Jesus name we pray bless the ones that are sick and the ones that are traveling back and forth Lord many families are gone today we pray that you should be with them as they come back home and tomorrow also with labor day coming up we pray that you just keep us all safe on the highways in Jesus name we pray amen I believe that I believe I had rather I had rather sit with you guys sisters and brothers than to sit with any sports star and I like sports and I enjoy it that's okay if you enjoy it to a degree um you know we had a Archie Moore the boxer was here in the church for a little while Brother D Moore's Daddy and Daddy got an autographed fifty dollar bill not wanting a dollar it's a fifty dollar bill so he got an autograph but you know that's great but you know what I'd rather be sitting with some of you talking about you instead of talking about what he did 40 years ago in a fight or what somebody did you know 30 years ago there's a man in our community his name's Tyrus Brown well he was named after Tyrus Cobb Ty Cobb which was probably one of the greatest baseball players in the 20s and 30s well you know he's a nice guy to sit down and talk to because he's named after him and actually came to him so it was nice and he's in his 70s or close to 80. so he kind of remembered takov well I like to sit and listen to that but you know what if one of y'all walked in the room my attention would go to you because that's the word of God coming communion as we're talking today communion we are we're bringing together sitting in Heavenly places I'd rather talk about something heavily than talk about something Earthly had y'all not hey man I'd rather talk about something heavily than something that's down here it's okay to talk about stuff down here you understand we're human beings but if there's a choice that we have we should take the choice like the Bible says with the Lord's despised few which you know I'm following Jesus and I'm going through so let's read John 1. in the beginning what's the word where was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us that is the son of man will we get to it that's what we're trying to build because look this stature of a perfect man is going to be manifested through your human flesh the stinking human flesh and the stinking thinking that your mom and daddy brought here contrary to God 's going to use that same flesh to manifest these virtues the only way for it to get out is to come through your flesh amen everybody all right with that and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth he may be seated in the Lord as blessing to the reading of the word but think about that when you shake hands with somebody you're shaking hands with the Flesh of God everybody all right with that doesn't matter we're shaking hands with the Flesh of God so why would we want to when we get up here to the brotherly kindness why would we want to belittle people all the time why would we want to shun people all the time and we always you know as well as I do you look at each other and I think I said something to Sister Barbara the other day I said you didn't shake my hand well I mean you know we we're kidding when we say that but she didn't shave my hand but you see what I mean you try to shake everybody's hand you try to be where you don't shun people but it ain't gonna it ain't gonna always be that way but we really try to get around to make sure that everybody gets greeted and everybody else why some of you um if we have visitors you need to get yourself out there because I can't get out there too quick but you can get yourself out there and shake their hand and um tell them God bless you and good to have you here amen listen uh and and we'll talk about something like today but later on but we need if we we talk about doing stuff overseas and all which is wonderful and great and I appreciate it and I believe we should but we what brother Brown say the worst thing it needs to be um that needs to be evangelized your community your neighbor your wayward uh just like we were talking about going to Ohio and and really being an impression on the on uh brother Christian's mom and dad and on um sister Tabitha's mom and dad and to me that was worth it because they're still closer relationship um even brother Isaac I know he won't mind me saying that even him and sister Tabitha are all having a better relationship because they saw the love of God instead of somebody wanting to kick him in the teeth all the time hey man this is not a kick in the thief gospel we can do that from the pulpit for a little while but you do it with what you do it with softness and you try to do it with not so much um not so much beating the people up but where's our Outreach we talk about an Outreach where's our Outreach oh it's just us for no more well you know what if somebody hadn't said something to you you might be able to still been out there hey man so let's shake our neighbor's hand and say God bless you and we appreciate you like I said you all know who lives beside me I've got two gay guys lives beside me and I just didn't sit down talk to them and talk to anybody as far as worldly people not y'all but um why not say God bless you come to church what would you what would you do if two gay guys walked into this church huh no you're all gonna be going please do thank you that's what we should do we should show what I said the virtue of Jesus Christ the knowledge of Jesus Christ The Temperance of Jesus Christ first Thessalonians says look that every one of you should know how to possess when we get finished with this we should know how to possess our vessel and we got a lot of work to do all of us have work to do but we all want to pull together and get it done right we want to get this thing done to where we can have a uh we can have an Ephesian Church a powerful Church 12 people in the Church of Ephesus brother Brown said a powerful Church while they all had the Holy Ghost and they all were mature Christians he said and then and then brother Paul could come up and preach to him and he could preach about predestination he could preach about things that he couldn't preach to the current to the Corinthians all right Corinthians he was always correcting them about something first one thing and another because they just kept a bunch of heathens coming in but now they were they were coming into the gospel so Paul didn't kick him out he just had to smack them a little bit more than he did to Ephesians but the Ephesian church is what we're trying to get to where they were mature and we know what we're talking about the word of God Amen I hope that's your goal your goal I don't think is to get a star for being a church every Sunday that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor Romans 12 verse 2 says be not conformed to this world I keep reading this because we're going to get into some things that maybe is going to be contrary to the way you grew up these these virtues are totally contrary to the way you grew up anybody with me so it's going to take a renewing of your mind it's going to take you to listen how many people you listen to a sermon especially you listen to brother Branham and you you listen to a tape and you go man that guy can tell a story he could tell a story and you could be right you would be he'd be like he'd have you right in the middle of that story and he could tell that so simple but it was so profound that was a prophet talking to us breaking it down for us because look he had went back into the back part of God's mind he had went and got something but praise God he didn't lock it back up he opened it so we could get in it so it was a renewing of our mind through his mind that you may what proof so you're going to prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God what is the will of God it's his word it's for his word to be made manifest in a group of people you can talk about viles plagues trumpets you can put Daniel 70 weeks together you can do all these things but it comes down to one thing and that's manifest in the word of God manifest in Christ amen all right second Peter one we read part of this but we're going to read this now and then we'll let brother random explain it in a minute now Peter is talking he's a servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith so whatever the holy ghost that Peter had you and I supposed to have amen amen all right but now what Peter is talking to us now he's talking to us with the Holy Ghost with the virtues come on he already he had the virtues to be able to tell you what to do he had these virtues because remember we're supposed to come back to the faith of the fathers Peter was one of the fathers all right brother Brown was supposed to what turn us back to that to this right here and be able to preach in 1962 or whenever it was to preach the statue of a perfect man and him be standing in that stature and being able to and I'll read you a quote in a couple weeks maybe where he said Lord Build Me Up that I may teach Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists so that we can all come to the unity of the faith not just one or two people all right to them that have obtained light precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given us all things that pertaining to life and godliness we're going to get a life lesson we're going to get a life lesson through this it's going to be life and what godliness what I tell you about getting the Holy Ghost if you get the Holy Ghost and you get these virtues working in your life you're not going to quit having problems but you're sure going to know how to deal with them you're sure going to know how to not you know what always told tell Jim when I get a little bit uh beside myself I go over in the corner and stick my thumb in my mouth and get in the fetal position and act like a kid all right well we don't want to be doing that we won't want to be babies we want to grow up right when God and I'll read you quote here in just a few minutes we'll talk about brother Brown he says When God says no what are you going to do in other words when God says uh what are you going to do if you're a mature Christian you'll know that's the best yes you ever got but as a baby you're still going to go what why why kids why why why daddy why don't why why why why and and with a lot of kids I said so will work but takes a lot of times brother John it I said so don't matter you got explained to him why are you going to do that all right we're about giving unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these promises you might be partakers listen I don't want to be a partaker of my old nature do you I mean think with me today do you want to be a part of your old nature do you want that old nature to rise back up and you start doing the things you used to do oh my heavenly no I do not but I want this right here that you might be partakers of the divine nature the divine nature of God having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and then there's where we were we began several months ago with justification sanctification on to the baptism of Holy Ghost and that's the faith now at the bottom of the pyramid and I'll read you some quotes and I know that you and I do not have to be told that you got to have the new birth first all right because some people in the message think you've got to get all the way up there until you get the Holy Ghost where it says holy spirit now I don't there's no way you can get the faith of God without having gotten side of you because you're contrary to God until you're born again right so seeing that you purified your souls and obeying the truth so we've come to we've come to a base we've got our foundation our foundation is that we're born again are that we're not and let's start right here at justification and let's go to sanctification let's go to the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right because look the if these things are required God's made a way for you to get there but you got to go that way you can't go around that's right you got to go right exactly the way he said and thank God for sending a prophet that told us exactly how to do it seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit under unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptable seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever now Paul's telling us he says all right come on we got to go therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on into Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and the faith toward god of the doctrine of baptism and laying on of hands and resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment see once you get and I know some of you got baptized over again which is fine that's okay I'll baptize as many times as you need to be baptized anybody's windows down I hope not you're going to get a car wash on the inside Anderson's heading down I just saw him run out and go down so what happens to other people too so yeah so see it happens it happens that's just the way it goes so the doctrine of baptism listen if you want to be baptized that's fine but there's a time when you got to be settled there was a time when you got to say this is it he got time when you say look this is I'm done I've done this enough enough times this is I think some I'm gonna say it anyway I think some people use water baptism as something to you know like well I'm going to get washed of everything and then I'll start over well that's fine to a degree but it's a soul washing not a flesh washing all right it's not a flesh it's not just you know you go down a wet set you go down to dry Center come up a wet Center no the Bible says repent all right so we got to repent first but now that we know that let's go on to something else of the doctrine of baptism of laying on our hands listen we all know how to baptize be baptized amen we know it's not father son Holy Ghost we know it's the Lord Jesus Christ well then we don't have to preach sermons on them now listen if there's new people come in absolutely we need to but to be a mature Christian we can't stay on that that's what Paul's saying do quit let's quit staying right here let's continue and Go on a little bit higher let's be like the Ephesians church when I say predestination that's not a bad word not to the Ephesians but now when brother Brown said it's a bad word used in a regular congregation because he's got some Corinthians setting in this congregation and some Ephesians that really wouldn't know what he's talking about but he's got some Corinthians in there some babies that don't know what predestination is because if it's top as you say predestined or predetermined Destiny it's then you don't have no choice but by foreknowledge then you put it right amen so if the doctrine of baptism laying on of hands resurrection of the Dead Eternal judgment we know that hell's not Eternal so we don't have to preach on hell not being eternal all right we know the resurrection of the Dead that we were talking about last night you're going to have a first resurrection now here with the dead Saints rest of the people are going to be dead for until the second Resurrection which is after the thousand years is over with so we don't have to preach we have Bible study on it yeah but we don't have to sit here every sermon and preach it because you know what it's not going to get boring but it's going to be like if you're a real child of God you'll be going come on give me some more I know that's right give me some more I know there's some more to get so give me some more same thing with this Tabernacle same way with the Old Testament listen the Old Testament was a type it spoke of what was coming that spoke of Jesus Christ that Ark and the difference that spoke of Jesus Christ and then when Jesus Christ was here he spoke to you spoke of me and you that's who he came for he came to show us how to live and he said I'll come back and go inside of you and I'll help you so there's the ark that's Jesus Christ we don't have to talk about it anymore let's continue on now we know and I like what Sister Christine said we were talking this morning after between Services you see that um the two tables of stone then you see that little basket of of Mana am I with me now for 40 years they wandered in the wilderness that was more important there couldn't have been no more in 40 pieces in there so I'm like I'm like her I believe it just multiplied itself as they went in there and started eating it then they'd hey he did it when he was on Earth he did it when it was on Earth he multiplied the bread when he was on Earth he might we might as well say he multiplied it spiritually right there to show that he was going to multiply it naturally and to show that you and I like brother Brown said he said that's the type of the Holy Ghost so you're not going to run out of it he's gonna keep getting more because Amanda was typing of the whole time of the Holy Ghost and then that Rod that stick is me and you but we know Jesus Christ had to come into Humanity first to die for us not first human being but first come into Humanity before he could die for us he couldn't die as the son of God he couldn't die as the Eternal God as the Jehovah he had to come down and come into human flesh and I was as I said last Sunday as soon as he decided that was what he's going to do when he come through that Matrix or would he come through that womb he was a human when that soul went inside of him it couldn't migrate over here somewhere else and do like it used to do it would appear and disappear it stayed in that body it stayed in that body so he could what be our brother but yet be God the fullness of the godhead bodily everything was inside of him amen but this thing the ark symbolizes the son of man because it's the human flesh part of God it's what that Ark was a symbol of and we know that it was overlaid which speaks of deity I'll get through this pretty quick you cover it overlay it with gold that's deity over the wood Christ over the church inside and out deity overlaid then he talks about the law speaking of judgment there the two tables of stone that was the law but between the law and the congregation there was something for deity stood in its place the type of Christ between the wrath of God and the judgment and Hell listen even in the Old Testament God allowed that blood of the animal to hide or cover sin until he could come in human flesh right amen sprinkle the blood so Christ standing in the way with an atonement made to save us from our sins and to heal us from our sickness deity stands in the way between judgment and then we looked at Aaron's Rod everything in it was restored again that's what we're looking for folks we're not looking for just a new birth wow potassium that's the most important thing because it puts you in line amen the new birth puts you in line to get these virtues the new birth puts you in the body heirs and Joint heirs but you I mean what are you going to know if you don't have a will it tells you well just show up brother John and we'll give you something no when you go there's usually a will that says this one gets this this one gets this that one gets this and I'm going to give this to this and I'm going to give this to charity it's all and that's what this right here was wrote 66 books of the Bible was our the will that was written this is what you're going to get hey man and that's why you can see yourself in there and that's the that's the family you're talking about Family Bible that is the Family Bible that's me and you that's our family like I said before somebody I'd love to talk to everything was restored that's the way a sinner is when he goes under the Shekinah Glory of the Holy Spirit the veil drops behind him have you ever really been there ask yourself that question have you ever really been behind the veil have you ever really been shut in with God in a secret place as the song says have you ever had that experience as I say brother Keith Reed says that experience have you ever had that experience with God you ask yourself that question the veil drops behind you what you're sealed you're sealed when that Veil drops you're sealed until the day of your Redemption but what you got to do is remember you got to come out of that Veil and so and go live it that's the hard part everything that you ought to have been a Son of God blooms out in him again then we talk about the fruits of the spirit and that's what we're going to do we're going to we're going to come out of the holy of holies we got born again right a born-again experience is the holy of holies right we're going to come out of that though like the priest came out and declare that their sins were forgiven in Israel for another year we're going to declare to the world that my sins have been forgiven forever not just for a year that was a substitute that was that was a type but when we walk out and we get free always somebody get free we get free and have freedom and we can tell the world fruits of the spirit love joy long-suffering goodness gentleness patience that's what we need to get in the third step get over into the Shekinah Glory where that little sacred light was hanging over The Mercy Seat brother Brown tells us again we're a stick of some kind and you were taken off the branch of humanity which was God created his son in the beginning listen everybody could partake of the tree of life if they wanted to amen everybody can we got to come boldly to the throne of grace we've got to come boldly to that tree and eat off of that tree all right everybody with me but some will and some won't some will like I said some will despise the cross some will come to it and some will take up their cross I hope you get that in your mind and I want you to know listen yeah we can read that thing called Pilgrim's Progress everybody read that you may and you get involved in that journey of that person you get involved right and you know the little things that happens in that story well what about you what about you what about your journey what about your story what about your moving through this way and moving through that way and God moving you over this way and showing up over here and right that's why you're written Epistles folks you're the book you're the book that's right you're writing it yourself you're writing your own script good or bad hey man you may be falling dead alienated from God but by that in creation you were created to be a Son of God so everyone has a chance to be a son and daughter of God we know that you may bounce around and be respected and honored out here in the courts but if you ever get into that glorious place and hide away with God you'll yield what you're supposed to do listen folks there's going to be like I said Wednesday night there's going to be billions that deny the cross billions there's going to be probably hundreds of millions that come to the cross but there's only going to be a few million that take up the cross amen so it gets narrower it gets smaller and smaller and smaller you know why it's the narrow way and few that be to find it notice every year the high priest entered into that place the congregation followed him up when he went into this great place the veil dropped the inner Court the holy of holies no one dared go in after him he was alone with God what a beautiful picture it is today of a consecrated life who once enters into Christ into with Christ dead to the things of the world hid away with God and the veil drops down around in all the worlds shut off we ought to do that here and I know it's humanly impossible I'm just going to be honest it's humanly impossible to just totally shut everything off you're going something's going to pop up in your head you got a doctor's appointment tomorrow we got to do this in the afternoon the cows need to be fed you know that cat that's got diarrhea he's got to go to the doctor okay I told him the story behind that is why I say it all the time because I had a I had a high school teacher that he would be out a good bit and he when he would be out he'd come back in and we'd say oh where you been you know so and so I'm gonna call him where you been he said well my cat had diarrhea so I mean that's all he said he could have been off you know somewhere else he's not my cat had diarrhea so I took a day off just another excuse that's why he's saying just another excuse just like I said this morning then Christianity and religion becomes a pleasure to every believer I want us to in this church to to let that be a goal of ours that when we go up that start as we go up that statue of perfect man all of us harness together pull it getting up that statue of perfect man it becomes a pleasure a pleasure to be here amen a pleasure to come here to every believer today people just have enough religion to make them miserable now like I said this morning I've seen those people have you not just makes them miserable well they ain't a full-blooded Christian there he might be in the journey but they ain't got a Shekinah Glory yet because when you meet God and you know that fires went inside of you you got to be a different person know that you ought to do this they're trying to escape hell well if that's the way I felt about it brother I don't know what I'd do now let's look at this full thing just for a second and then we'll get started where we left off this morning we know we've got to be born again before we can come into this pyramid or this teaching of the virtues everybody with me I've been over this for two months so you ought to understand that and this is the way it looks just like that but now what I have what we have we we covered it one time a long time ago what we're doing now though is we're doing what I said we've come out we went into the outer Court justification inner Court sanctification we went into the holy of holies we've got the new birth we met God now what we're doing is we're coming back out and we're going to manifest what we met in there right so we're going to come out and get back into that outer court again where it's not the justification that he chops off your past sins is where you're going to realize that the real you didn't do that right they're by with me a little higher up a little higher understanding of justification and then also as we continue on up now what's sanctification cleaned and set aside for service now the baby form Justice sanctification is all those unclean demons got driven out of your soul but not out of your memory reason conscious affection imagination I wished it was but God left that yeah God left that so Satan can still bombard you because you're living in this human world he left that there for what for you to overcome with you don't overcome with this you overcome you've already overcome in your soul you're already sitting in Heavenly places like we said last night if you're born again today your soul is in another dimension because it's Eternal it's in another place not in another place you understand what I mean but inside of you it's in a different area a different world Heavenly places I just read you the Bible that's the position you have but now still your memory reason conscious affection imagination it's where this virgin all this tempered faces godliness brother callous has got to be let out of yes goodbye with me okay I want to make it simple where we understand why we have to have these virtues it's because it's a requirement for us to get all the way up to that headstone or the son of man dispensation which that's what we're in now we just got to catch up to it everybody with me we got broccoli said amen now listen if a man that's been in this message for 50 years says amen and knows he needs to grow up a little bit more everybody in this building ought to say Amen right that's honesty though same with all of us we need to get to a place to where God can use us more I'd like for God to use me more listen the devil used me long enough the devil is did he leave oh he didn't y'all oh maybe only sister Alicia and me that's only two people well brother Boyd I think he raised his hand well praise God there's three of us that uh anywho we were the only three honest people in the building right because I want I'm long enough for him I won't do something for God and the only way to do it is is to have what the virtue of God the temperance of God listen I had the temperance of the devil long enough boy brother long enough I had enough of that yes patience godliness brother kindness we'll get to it all but see I've got it written out there to the side or brother Bob did this for me wonderfully where it says sanctification now look that's not driving the unclean Spirit out of your soul that's done finished sealed God's in there can't get in actually God can't get out he said he said he's going to come and be in you not in you and out of you he's going to be in you but that second realm or that Spirit realm is where God left that for us to overcome everybody with me we've already overcome in the soul because listen prove it brother wait all right you pass away today and you're born again your soul goes into another dimension immediately goes into the sixth dimension everything else stays out here the body you know stays here so then you still it didn't that you were you didn't acquire it as you went to get into that other dimension you got it already and it carries you into it carries your soul your very being into that other dimension and praise God that when we come back here and pick up if we have to pass away we come back here and pick up our human body that all the Bible says the former things will pass away behold all things have become new you won't remember listen the things that bothered you today they're not going to bother you let us not they're not the former things will pass away behold all things have become new you won't be thinking about all the fusses you had with your wife or your husband the trivials I was going to say stupid but the trivial things that you you you get mad at each other about and you're like man how many of y'all as you get older things don't bother you as much yeah I praise the Lord amen some of you don't hadn't raised your hand and I know why because it does stuff don't bother me no more it don't bother me no more than but boy I used to stay up at night and it just gnawed me not anymore babe sleep is much better but that to me though that sanctification that's getting that unclean that's not saying you're unclean but the spirits that bother you are unclean which what they influence you boy I like that that's new that's fresh I'm glad I got that one it's not you it's the what's influencing you now whether you say all right come on in I'll entertain that or you can say no you need to stay out there amen you need to stay out here resist the devil and he will what flee from you so there's sanctification the unclean Spirit going out and staying out we want them to stay out the problem is until we get to a real good case of being adopted son and daughter of God we open the door and let him back in sorry we do but I want us to realize that we can come to a place that we can be like Jesus that we can walk through a crowd and and somebody say that's a Christian and I want to just touch his a piece of his cloth of His Garment and I know I'll be made home Peter and then walk am I in the scripture people in their Shadow were healed what if they turned around brothers and preached the sermon to him and everybody starts screaming and shaking and praising God walking down the road and people just walk by and go whoop oh blinded eyes open cancer being done away with spy somebody walking by that's the way I want to be I won't be able to influence the world and they never even know I was there that's what I want right brother John I want to influence the world and not have to get this great big star listen we're going to get our Stars we're going to get our crowns it's going to be in another dimension and they'll be Eternal there'll not be something temporal but I want somebody to have an influence that's right like brother Ryan was talking about Mom and Dad having an influence on his on his marriage you notice he didn't say something y'all I wasn't looking at y'all so you can smack him if you want to see what I mean about that see I know I know but why but that's a virtue that strength was drawn from what them going hey we're better than the rest of y'all no it's just living alone living a life living a rock cow life living the best virtue knowledge tempers patience and godliness brother kindness that you know how to live and that sanctification yo hold hands now I'll get you when I get home I'm glad we can some people you can do that too but that sanctification that's the unclean Spirit the little things the little demons now that's going to be cast out right as we go up this statue of perfect man we're going to try all of us to have more virtue that's what I said when I mentioned it just a few minutes ago if you caught what I said I'd rather be around y'all than to be around somebody in the world in the world why I draw strength I draw virtue from you everything I mean we have even listen when me and Danny's not here today when me and brother Nancy okay he's sick okay but when me and brother Danny is together and even when we start talking about hunting and he likes guns and I like guns and we talk about that it's a kindred spirit that comes together we might not say the word name Jesus but there's a kindred spirit there that you can stand there and talk to somebody and feel comfortable with I want people to feel comfortable around me around you everybody feel comfortable not when you walk up to him like man I don't know if I should you know get over in the corner and do you know your Hail Marys and all that no I want to be comfortable around somebody I want it back like I said this morning but talk to God to God don't you want to talk to God and not bother you everybody you know you come in with your sin and you come into this load and you you come in like I don't want you to do that he said put your burdens on me and then let's talk about it put your burns on me and let's discuss this thing I'm not gonna kill you you're my child it our kids meant always going to try to kill him at one point in time but they all survived he leaves sanctification everybody with me so and then look we get up to the very top it says a special anointing well that is a special anointing that is the baptism of the Holy Ghost like brother Brown said and we'll read it where it seals everything together as a unit and you're grown up and then what can God do he can set that cap right there on top of you and then your words are as good as his words you don't have to pray didn't Jesus walk up one day and he walked up the Lazarus tomb and he said father I don't even need to pray but I'm going to pray because these people are here that way he said he said I'm going to pray because of them in other words he could have just walked up and said Elijah come on but because of them them what the unbelievers that were around him he said I'm going to pray to you father to show that I show obedience right but he was the father made manifest in another form called called Jesus Christ and who are we we're we're the bride in another form are called Jesus Christ we're the bride all right so that's what we're heading to so I'm just going to try to give you that a little bit and then we were talking about again this morning about the enemies of the Cross get to the cross and then carry your cross we're all going to have to carry across that maybe we have not ever carried before all right everybody prepared for that I think we are if you go to uh go to countdown and read Countdown the prophet of God says we're pressurized for this age we're pressurized for this age other Ages were not pressurized there's a lot of other ages I was watching an old movie it was a documentary do you know now you know we go what 30 000 feet in a regular jet when we go somewhere it's like 30 35 000 feet well they have to turn the oxygen on because of what the pressure's so they have to pressurize the cab or the cabin and then they have to put oxygen in there you know what they used to do back before they had all that they had an oxygen tank sitting down in the floor of the airplane there was a tube that run up and they put it in their mouth like there and they breathed the oxygen to keep from dying they'd pass out if they got so high and that was only like 20 000 feet well where are we going now if if Elon Musk has anything to do with it we're going to be able to take a weekend trip to the moon drive up there and drive back listen it was unheard of in NASA unheard of in 1969 and 68 when they had the great Mercury rocket that took them to the Moon but they always had to replace it it always had to come apart it always had to had to destroy part of it right what did Elon Musk do he goes down he makes a rocket that goes out there and goes into the into the space and then comes back lands just like parking a car in a parking place look at that technology from just that period of time of 20 30 40 years well that's the same way we should be in the gospel we shouldn't be stuck in 1990. 80 2000. remember what I said when brother Brown was talking about the uh and I don't have the quote but I read it a couple weeks ago brother I'm talking about a fresh Revelation let the Manna fell every day and he said oh that's okay if you had your experience 20 years ago he said but now that's got wiggle tails in it wow you gotta have a new one you gotta have a new experience with God you can't take the old sure the old is something to build on that's what we're going to build on we're going to build the foundation on the foundation of the Apostle and the prophets Jesus Christ being the Chief Cornerstone yeah bye okay so the victim didn't carry the whole cross but only the Cross Beam thank God we just got to carry the beam hey man we don't have to care 400 pounds of cross We Carry the Cross Beam but we do got to carry this cross right here so the first beam would be Faith then the next beam is virtue the next beam is knowledge we got to carry that from any walk of whom I have told you often now even weeping Paul's weeping that there are enemies of the Cross of Christ whose end is destruction whose God is their belly and whose glory is in their shame who mine the Earthly things they they're written in a book but it's not the Book of Life they're never going to accept God Colossians 2 blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross all right his cross now he's going to talk about our cross what we were talking about this morning for Christ sent not me to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest across the Christ should be made of non-effect for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness all right but unto us which are saved it is the power of God Matthew 10 37 he that loveth father a mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me he's not worthy of me follow after me so that means he's already made it we're following after him all right he's blazed the trail just like I said before many older ones brother they own different ones as blazed the trail so that it's easier for us to follow if we want to they found the quotes when we couldn't find the quote they had to find them like this right we just go like sister cleator was what we were looking for a quote last night she called me about uh a quote about Billy Paul and having a dream well I put in Billy Paul She said he said something about dark and dream so I put all that four in and there it was now to have to find that in a physical book uh it took days so they blazed the trail now that well we don't have to do that we've got the computers we've got the diff we got our watch we can get quotes on our watch there's no excuse more is given though more is required and when he shall call the people unto him with his disciples and he said what unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself we're going to have to deny a lot of self to get up this statue of a perfect man a lot of self but he said if you'll take up his take up your cross and follow him he said lay his burden he's burdens light and he said unto them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me then he keeps reading the same thing then Corinthians I Die daily now let's read this right here actually let's skip this and let brother Branham read it for us you want to do that let's do that let's get through all this oh let's read this one right here this is why am I against organized religion 1962 and that's the way God does the church he beats every Creed every denomination every man-made Dogma until see he sees his own life reflecting in you he's talking about beating gold they knew they had the gold had all the drops beat out when they could see their reflection almost like a mirror you could see your reflection in the gold all right that's what he's talking about if I do not the works of my father believe me not see if what is purpose to the church the life that was in Christ isn't reflecting in you don't you stand still if you haven't got patience virtue all these things and Temperance and things and godliness and brotherly kindness and all these things that's required of you so don't tell me it's not a requirement it's required I can't get it yes you can the curriculum is giving you the ability to do that all right influence of another in Jeffersonville now we want to go to our own Sunday school if you have one but if you have no Sunday school you'd like to be with us I want to speak this morning and put it on blackboard teach on the full stature now see he's talking about that attached to a perfect man excuse me preaching in the morning he must be preaching this one on Saturday night so he's preaching this on Sunday morning the full statue of a perfect man and draw it out in the Blackboard and show God's requirements and how we come to the perfect stature of a perfect man before God everybody with me all right here we go let's read this right here this is Brother random reading second Peter so now let us read I mean for second Peter first chapter portion of it Simon Peter servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God In Our Savior Jesus Christ I like the way that stated right there because my whole subject this morning is based on faith see let me read that again listen close Simon Peter a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that obtain obtained the light precious Faith through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ notice he is saying that I have obtained this Faith am I and I am addressing this to them that has obtained like Precious faith now what is his light precious Faith the new birth yes what is your light precious Faith then you birth so you got to have the new birth first look it is not to the outside world this is to the church see those that are in Christ then he continues reading Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and through of Jesus Christ Our Lord according as his divine power has given unto us all things his divine power has now given unto us all things that pertain to life and godliness to the knowledge of him that has called us the glory and virtue whereby are we giving on given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these what these promises we might be partakers of the divine nature now listen if God makes a promise he's got to keep it so he promised to give you this divine nature and to give you these virtues he promised he would I mean it doesn't matter if you've got a fourth grade education or 14th grade education doesn't matter listen all our all our problem is is our yielding it's in our yielding yeah age doesn't matter intelligence doesn't matter it's how much we yield to God it's how much importance we put on this that or the other all right now let that soak real deep now not preaching this morning just teaching this lesson divine nature let me read that fourth verse again and I'll show you won't miss it whereby we are given we're by we are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these these promises we might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust now brother Brown says see the world we've escaped that now he's addressing this to the church that's why we're here this morning watch is to find out what is the way what is God's requirement now if God requires it we got to do it but if God requires it he gives us a place to go to get it all right there's not a person in here that loves God but wants to become more like Christ why did you become a question a Christian to go by being like the world no you want something you want to have something at virtues in your life now that's laid out here every Christian all right the statue of perfect man 1962. that's the way it is with Christ see we've got to be so in love with him to when we ask for something here it is when we ask for something and he doesn't give it to us that doesn't shake us a bit not a bit see see why the only way you can do that is to become partakers of his divine nature then you'll understand the reason he can't give it to you you'll understand the reason that he can't give it to you and how's he going to give it to us Ephesians 4 11. and he gave some Prophet Apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come all till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature or not statue stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children all right we're moving away from children we're moving away from the oxygen in our mouth to drive the airplane no we've come to a seven seven seven Hallelujah a 777 yet they may come now you know and that seven seven Jets got everything you need you don't have to put stick nothing in your mouth it's got you just turn a switch and there you got your you got your pressurized you've got everything you need and just fly the airplane that we henceforth be no more children have you ever watched the first airplane the Wright brothers they got a little film about it you've seen that thing that they flew they flew it like six feet off the ground for like 20 feet that was the first airplane now we can fire them off of a deck of a of a boat wow and run 1500 miles an hour and they were running about five best they could do they're peddling like crazy and got about that off the ground all right see what we've come to now are we still peddling in the gospel are we driving to 777 it's your choice no more children tossed to and fro and carried away with every wind of Doctrine what by the slide of men preachers by the slot of men and cunning craft in this whereby they lie and wait to deceive they are going to try to deceive you but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and look I like this word compacted I mean man when you pack it in there sister Freda when you pack it it's packed There's No Air there's no anything there's no there's no air bubbles pack it in there compacted by that which every joint supplies according to the effectual working as a measure of every part make its increase of what the body I'm not trying to get y'all built up individually just so you can be an individual built up anybody with me on that builds you up as an individual so that the group can come together and work as a unit a man workers are uni because that's what it says right here according to the effectual working and the measure of every part I am make his increase of the whole body unto the edifying of itself in love brother Brown tells us 1962 statute of perfect man I haven't read many quotes from the statue perfect man so I'm going to read a few this afternoon and then we'll go right into our communion well now that's the way it is trying to manufacture Christianity he's talking about a blackbird sticking peacock feathers into into it to look like a peacock the first thing you've got to do is be born again I don't know how in the world then people get that Doctrine if that's in the Statue of perfect man book write it the first paragraph 94. he comes out right out of the gate says you got to be born again you've got to be changed and when you're changed you become a new Cree creation creature now you're getting right now now you don't have to worry about the feathers it'll take care of itself when you're born again like I've said before you take a hog scrub him up put a tucked sailor suit on him or tuxedo suit rather on him and turn him out where is he going to go he's going to go right back to the mud he's going to mess that pretty old suit that you gave him why because he's still a pig because you see it wouldn't do any good he's a hog that's his nature wallowing is his nature that was our nature to wallow in the world you've got to change his nature and he the rest of it will take care of itself now notice you must be born again that is changed there's got to be a change he said well brother Branham I know this certain woman over here why she never did nothing wrong she's a good woman or this such and such a man he's a good man he never does anything you know he doesn't harm anybody that doesn't mean one thing he might make a good neighbor but if he isn't born a Christian until he's born again Jesus said accept the man be born again he cannot even see the kingdom now that means he means to understand all right now the statue of perfect man again paragraph 102 just right after that paragraph notice you must be born again and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith see on my chart here I got the very Foundation faith is the foundation of all of it for without faith is impossible to please God he that cometh the God must believe that he is what that he is God and a rewarder of those that diligently seek him see he must be and when you're a skeptic of the Bible when you're skeptic of the word let me put this in when you're a skeptic of the message right being right you just might as well stay back until first you believe it what is sin unbelievable there's only two elements that controls the human being now here we go that's either what doubt or faith one or the other not both you're possessed of one that dominates your life just depends on how much Faith you have is how high you can rise but first you've got to hell it's got to be Faith let me stay on that foundation for a while that's why we've been on the foundation of faith for a while Faith Is What You Must Believe faith is the substance the thing hope for look you already have it when you have faith because it's revealed in faith faith is the substance that leans hope for the evidence what is it what kind of an Evidence a holy evidence a holy evidence that's what we've come into this we've come to a holy evidence we come to a time that when you get born again you go in the holy of holies you have an experience with God you walk out then you got to live it you walk out back out into the outer Court where there's the Gentiles again there's all the sacrifices there's all the things that are going on around you but remember that song shut in with God you can be in the middle of 10 million people and be shut in with God can you not I mean don't you feel alienated when you get around a group of people and they're you and they're all thinking different obviously they're talking different they look different they're acting different because they are different but you've been changing you're sitting there and then they're you know they're screaming about you know who's marrying this and in Hollywood and who's the new car that's coming out and all this if you've seen this at the uh um post office they always talk about some new uh series and they talk about it just like they're living in you know Yellowstone or something what something's going on now about something like that and then there what's Sally boys you see what she did the other day I mean they're wasting their time it's a fantasy That's what Satan wants to give you a fantasy something to what fantasize with that's why he give us Sports listen this nation we're concerned with sports and I used to be too concerned with it I mean people die for it I Wouldn't Die for one of them sorry millionaires if he got born again I probably would but he'd die for me too but you know what that's the world and it comes and it what it separates the whole world couldn't go behind the holy of holies there is a separation time like I was saying this morning with sister Gail you know she always said God's along his arm it arm is long it is but it's got a place where it ends 120 years his arm was long during Noah's time but at that end of that finger right there the end of that 120 years he said that's it I'm shutting the ark Noah I know you want to save everybody Noah we want everybody saved right but there's only going to be so many and we're not going to shut the door God's Gonna shut the door we're not going to end the Gentile dispensation God's going to end it God's one is going to do it sure we all got to come to our position our place amen amen amen but listen God's going to say how are we going to know it's a life's one what if the last one is in Africa or India or China or somewhere what if the last one comes in well we don't know that so God's going to shut the door but you know what we'll realize it because what we got the same spirit that person's got in in them him or her you know there is a last one there's always the last something you know the last there was the last one that's out there somewhere and he or she is just kind of walking around like this all of a sudden somebody's going to give them the message of the hour and they're going to accept it and then boom we're going to be gone God's arm is only going to be that long when the Gentile dispensation is over remember when the resurrection happens we were talking about it several weeks ago several months ago there's going to be 30 or 40 days we're going to still be hanging around here can't not one Gentile be saved during that time all your friends that's when the foolish virgin is going to come to us and say let me have some of your oil I see that you've I see that the resurrections happen I see that you you now broccoli you're about 20 years old now something that must have really happened something must have happened what happened well we got changed we just changed in a moment well they gonna know their self and they're still old and they look at you and you're young they miss something give me your oil we need well you should have got it before what I said before every disaster creates full churches because everybody gets a sense of religion and they gather in church and then when that when that goes away or ghost two three months down the road what is this nation what is this laodicea Lacks lacks a daisy well let's just go back you know Grandma told us the Lord was coming but this must not be it that's going to be one time when grandma's gonna be right let the Lord's come amen you love the Lord there's only two elements that controls human being that's either doubt or faith one or the other even when you're born again you still have doubt and fear but you can't have fear like you had before or you need to get born again so what is sin sin is unbelief sin is going to keep us from going up this statue of perfect man so like I said before let's just lay it out God forgive me of anything I've done you say the same thing and mean it and repent I'm sorry goes a long way to God amen all right let's let's stand our feet let's go let's take communion uh anybody need prayer let's stand to our feet all mine's clear we'll continue on next week we'll stop right there now on priest an hour man all right let's uh who's

it's like I said before and dad said many times it's kind of interesting that uh no we're not gonna read that we're gonna read Corinthians first sorry that Paul was not in at the supper table no need to prayer again okay yes ma'am hello Jesus I love sister Lord's got a cold we pray now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that you will take this away from the Lord and she'll be able to testify that it's been taken away Lord we thank you for this Lord to have a childlike Faith Lord I sure wish we all had that they would just believe Lord when somebody looks at you and says do you believe and they say yes that's all it takes for thank you in Jesus name amen you'll be good okay if you want to okay picture freighter's got something she'd like to say several weeks ago you guys talk loud hold it come right here come right here I don't mind you standing here you're not going to desecrate anything grief um several weeks ago I got up here and I asked if anybody knew of anything that I had done said gossip whatever um to to please also begging you to come to me and two people came to me and I never you'll never know what that meant to me and the one thing I remembered I should have written it down I went and made right and it was wonderful and but I cannot think of what who the other person was so if if you are a person that came to me could you please just privately come to me again so that I can make whatever I need to right amen thank you everybody good with that if you're that one or whatever you need to just talk to her in private it feels good to repent he feels good to repent hey man I mean it'll lift the load off of you that the devil had he can't stand repentance he wants to pile it on top of everything you just say you know uh not this time I'm sorry brother Louise I shouldn't have said what I said I'm sorry I apologize and you know what he feels better and so do I because most of the time if somebody ever walks up to me and somebody walks up to me the other day and said I'm sorry for so-and-so and I'm like I don't remember what that was but it was important to them hey man as long as I got it off it was important to them but you get it off that's why we're taking communion that's why we commune with God that's why Paul was able to write to communion because he said I have received of the Lord he wasn't there and I like what a brother said he said now Matthew Martin Luke and John that's four different gospels right and remember there was in one gospel there was two Blind Men another gospel that was one blind man in another gospel that showed you this way in this way well God didn't want the communion table to be that way he wanted one man a prophet to tell you what happened in the upper room to make sure that we did it the right way that it wasn't two Blind Men or one blind man or was it cups or was it right you understand what I'm saying then he gave us a prophet to give us clarity in the end time I thank God that we're living in this time of Revelation they say what they want to about William Mary Brown I really don't care they gonna have to face God they're going to face God Amen I was reading the other day and brother Brandon was so he and he said thus saith the Lord so many times and and all this happens that they can't deny but they deny the little things the little something you know the 12 people that fell off the bridge and blah blah blah blah all that stuff he's a man that stood and said I'll take this to judgment I'll face this now my word he's gonna have to face it if he's not right but we know he was but they're gonna what they're saying is is he's all false bro John 1100 sermons and all the people that got healed he was false listen there's so much insurmountable evidence that he was the prophet of God that there is no way that a sane person would believe any other way they have just got a demon on them a line demon that's lying to them about everything that's been said against the prophet of God Amen so I just want to make sure this is for me this message is for me all right it's for me all right all right you got to say the same thing it's for you too and man it's for you this message is for each and every one of us but God ordained it to come through one man to give us not one opinion he gave us what God Said he didn't give us an opinion of a denominational church that backed him up that's why he didn't go to the nominations well I stood alone God wanted him to stand alone he didn't want to have to say well brother Brown you can't preach that in that church no he wouldn't preach what he preached what God told him to preach amen so let's read the scripture for I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break and said take it this is my body which is broken for you and this is doing remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do you often as you drink it in remembrance of me everything is in remembrance of me not that we remembered that it was the first Sunday of every month no we remembered when we take this communion we're going to remember what he did all right in remembrance of me communion we're going to commune with God and say God thank you for doing what you did because I couldn't have done it you couldn't have done it no way you could have done what he did hanging on Calvary amen for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death until you till he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself sister Freda our sister examined himself examine see what's going on if you had to get something get out of the way get out of the way and and don't wait on the person you take communion today because you give everybody understand what I'm saying prophet of God said you might not can get to him right then but you better get to them when you get finished all right everybody with me so if you get if you're bothered by something take communion and then go make it right if that person's not around where you can you know where you can't do that but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworldly eatest and drinketh Damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world praise God wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another in other words stop for a minute do like sister freed it in check up the checking balances check the balance and make sure check it make sure everything's good everything's all right if you got a little something like I said something you know you say something to a co-worker make it right tomorrow take communion today it's not shouldn't stop you from taking communion all right but when we are judged we are chasing of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brother when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that he come not together into condemnation and the rest will I send an order when I come so let's have a moment of Silent prayer brother Brown said pray for your pastor I say pray for all the heads of deacons Elders everybody that has anything to do with the church because Satan would love to just tear us apart Satan would love to tear all of us apart but let's have a moment of Silent prayer and then let's take communion let's commune with God we thank you Lord for all things you've given us father now we as we partake to this bread and this wine Lord may we remember that you hung on an old dirty cross you hung on two sticks Lord that we're stuck into the Earth and father you did it for me you did it for our brothers and sisters here's Lord I pray that you and you don't ever have to do that again you did it once for all but Lord let us take up our cross though let us take that Cross Beam and pick it up and put it on our shoulders the strongest part of our body and let us carry our cross and follow you Lord and may that cross be transferred into feathers Lord is what brother Brown said this morning as wings those two cross pieces will turn into wings and Lord we'll fly away out of here one day probably give us our daily bread the day in Jesus name amen the Bible said he took bread and he blessed it Lord Jesus thank you for this bread it has been made with holy hands it's been made according to the way you need it made Lord with no leaven where it won't rise lord it's not something for us to take pleasure in but it's your body that was broken Lord that was taken and put through the most horrible horrible situations you stood that for me and and our brothers and sisters here Lord now as we partake of this Lord may we remember you in Jesus name we pray amen and then what are we going to do with this when we get done I'm going to take it home and I'm going to burn it before the next day because we don't hold it over we're going to burn it Beyond where you'll never be able to eat it again because tomorrow we want a fresh revelation and man just like the Manta we want a fresh revelation we don't we don't want to stale bread of the day before amen and that's that's something to say if you know that quote for brother Brown said well yeah you had an experience 20 years ago said but that's got wiggle tails in it now wow yeah it was an experience oh yeah I got saved you'd hear people you know I got saved back in 1995. started going to church went for two weeks I ain't been since but I'm saved I don't think so he might have come to the cross and got a good case of justification but thank God for a prophet that tells me that if I'm to that if I'm to think that I'm wrong hey man denominations can think that go out we're good like we're talking about last night you know everybody in the denominational World they think that there's going to be seven years of tribulation so when it comes and they miss it thank God we got seven years we're gonna be saved during that time we'll be fine well that's false and who told them that God no the devil told them that through a preacher sorry I didn't mean to say that loud sorry about John do a preacher though that's how they got it wolves lying in weight do you know what steal your soul not your body still your soul Satan wants to steal your soul he's got your body at the moment come on somebody he's got your body I'm looking at some old dead bodies right now amen but God's got your soul and Satan can't get it if he's got it amen dear heavenly father Lord this wine has been made also by holy hands now pray as we partake of it Lord that it will just be Lord wonderful even if it was made years ago it just keeps getting better and better Lord thank you for all these things that you give us Lord as we partake of this communion let us remember you father the blood that spilled all in the ground at Calvary Lord to sanctify a group of people Lord that can stand today Father and take this communion without any malice without any without any reserve Lord we can take this Lord as you told us we thank you for it Lord in Jesus name amen good morning how long by the river [Music] I'll rest needs that ever green tree I'll carry my my cross my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes I'm despised and reject him and I question oh Father how long then I take one more look at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength what to pick up your beam and carry it come morning I'll walk by the river oh all the cares will be over I'll rest need the evergreen tree will be at rest I'll carry my cross through the midnight gonna be some dark times come morning there's glory for me thank God we're not gonna have to real We're not gonna have any thought of the bad part of what we were here the sorrows and heartaches we've been through in the in the uh rejection by others by even your own family calling you you know crazy and you're a cult in your list and you're that well they call Jesus belzebub they called him a wine bibber they even asked it why does your master always eat with sinners and publicans you know why Jesus said because they needed saving amen you know what he was telling them you're not savable that's what he was telling the religious world you're not I didn't come to save you I come to save them amen what would it be if he acted so much like that Yeti was God Almighty and human flesh where the world looked at him and said you're Beelzebub you're the you're not the devil you're the prince of the Devils Belgium was the prince of demons not just demons he was the prince of demons he was the Apex of demons that's what they were calling Jesus was the Apex of being a demon thank you brother thank you brother let's remember him let's partake thank you Lord what a small symbol of what he'd done for us he was beat to a pulp for me and you he hung on the cross for hours Brother John he hung on the cross for hours just so that me and you can be saved he absolutely I get it I'll get he absolutely done something you and I would never do he didn't die for himself he died for me and you didn't die for herself he died alone the Bible says though song says he died alone for you and me it was not a lot of Glory going on at Calvary but it was the greatest moment that a man could do for someone else is to give his life not only that he could just give his life but he could come take that life and put it back inside of you because he had eternal life in his soul he wasn't just had eternal life brother Carly he was eternal life amen he was the man to give it to us he was our Boaz he was the one that gave us this gift now as we receive the new birth now let's take these other gifts these other promises and let's use them well what if I fail you can't fail you can't fail if you'll try if you'll give it to God all you got you cannot fail there's no way you can because somebody's going to fulfill all those scriptures that somebody made it hey man did somebody come to a place of adoption and then somebody come to a place of a body change and that body change has got to be not just a day on the calendar it's got to be when you and I come to a place to where death is destroyed and I can look at death and say uh no not me you go get somebody else but no not me brother Brian said death will call up your slave go up your sleeve and you'll just wipe it right off that's not a fantasy that will be a reality amen so let's read John chapter 13. and supper being ended the devil having now put in the heart of Judas is Carrot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hand and that he come from God and he went to God he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself and after that he pours water into a basin and began to watch the disciples feet and to walk them with the Tower with he was girded then cometh lead to Simon Peter and Peterson unto him Lord thus thou wash my feet Peter's fishing get a little training course because he's the one that's

in second Peter 1. add to your faith virtue knowledge temples patience godliness Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet you should never say never to God because he's fixing to talk to him again Jesus answered if I wash thee not you're going to have no part with me wow he didn't say a little bit or Peter it's okay this time I'll let you by no he said you'll have no part with me unless you wash some people's feet Simon Peterson unto him Lord not only my feet but also my hands and my head Jesus said unto him he that is washed and he does not saved to wash his feet but is clean ever with and you are clean but not all for he knew he knew who should betray him therefore he said you're not all clean so after that he had taken washes their feet taken His Garment sat down he said Noah

to a place now a lot of times back in his journey of his three and a half year Ministry they'd call him Lord and he said don't call me Lord they call him this they say don't call me this but he's come to the hour that he's fixing to fulfill his last part of scriptures heading to Calvary everybody with me heading to Calvary he said you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am he had to get that I am in there if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you barely verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them all mine's clear let's pray the heavenly father we pray Lord it should be with us in the furthermore of this service Lord as you be with us in the foot washing part Lord thank you for letting us take communion father there's going to be a time lord when we will not be able to get together maybe and do this but there's going to be a great reunion one day there's going to be a great youth meeting and we're all going to be the same age and we're all going to take wine and we're all going to take bread and we're all going to look across and say we made it we made it we made it into eternity well thank you Lord for that we pray now that you will give us a little glimpse of that today Father a little glimpse of that eternity Lord and the words that we speak to each other and the words that we read and the message of the hour and the Bible and the different things let us see just a moment of that eternity Lord that we're heading to Father we're heading on a journey and we pray that should be with us now and take
