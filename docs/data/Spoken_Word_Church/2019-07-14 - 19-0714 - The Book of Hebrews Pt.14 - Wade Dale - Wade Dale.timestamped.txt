[0:00] call them out not too long ago I was
[0:02] reading or we were listening up here we
[0:03] said it's old sister get it now where
[0:07] it's gonna pass you by and they need
[0:09] about two minutes later he says was hard
[0:11] to go from him you didn't give it but
[0:14] what happened was she didn't have
[0:15] focused faith and he didn't he couldn't
[0:19] supersede her and belief you know what
[0:22] even got ten super senior right he came
[0:32] that is correct that takes your torch
[0:34] away right now but now faith is the
[0:38] substance of things hoped for the
[0:39] evidence of things not saying why
[0:41] because if you see it you don't have
[0:42] that bad
[0:43] I just want it with these stables
[0:45] opening up why pop said when he still
[0:47] doesn't think truly open up in the
[0:49] degree they're supposed to open up we
[0:51] don't have to go back and go back to the
[0:52] first seat and leave it all over again I
[0:56] have paid to this open I think that we
[0:59] understand what's going on same way with
[1:00] Dan 170 week I know one I was thinking
[1:04] about this yesterday I guess I'll say it
[1:06] online there right there all this junk
[1:11] that's going on around the message I
[1:13] want to tell you something Paul said it
[1:18] and brother around him what a man and if
[1:20] he was there he said if an angel from
[1:23] heaven if I or an angel from heaven were
[1:29] to come and bring you something
[1:32] different than what I've already pre
[1:34] 20-sided let it be a curtain right
[1:39] they'd be accursed and he said it again
[1:43] he said in other words if you didn't
[1:45] hear me the first time let me state it
[1:47] again so what I'm telling you is even if
[1:49] brother Branham came back right now and
[1:52] went to Jefferson bill and said all that
[1:54] going on up there was okay
[2:00] let it be a curse that's what the Bible
[2:04] said let it be a curse because it's not
[2:07] scriptural right it's not scriptural we
[2:10] must go back to Scripture I mean how can
[2:13] we understand each sighs I mean deals
[2:16] tell talk about the other day I'd like
[2:17] to ask somebody this one question I'd
[2:21] like that
[2:22] sit down with somebody that thinks that
[2:24] we just need to press play and tell them
[2:26] to explain to me Daniel seventy weeks by
[2:28] these two quotes that I have when
[2:30] brother brown said that there's one week
[2:32] left after the rapture and that they're
[2:33] going reenact years left explain that
[2:37] without pressing play come if you press
[2:40] play you're going to get both what then
[2:43] you're going to give an opinion maybe no
[2:47] if you just press play you got this
[2:49] quote this quote how about let's stand
[2:51] and address the third person of the
[2:53] Trinity how about all these different
[2:54] things that the Holy Ghost is a lot
[2:56] horse rider he preached them it's on
[2:59] tape right how are you going to
[3:03] understand the Ethiopian eunuch is the
[3:05] best to me that's the greatest scripture
[3:07] to take to anybody he was reading the
[3:11] Bible he impressed play
[3:17] and he said how can I understand
[3:22] I'll let some man teach me
[3:26] so God sent Philip a man with the Holy
[3:31] Ghost to explain because he was reading
[3:35] the Bible and thought what is this Jesus
[3:37] or this day the courage is not Jesus was
[3:38] it David speaking of itself or somebody
[3:41] else why he was taking too close you
[3:44] can't do that you've got to have a
[3:46] fivefold ministry to break this thing
[3:47] down to the people because it just makes
[3:50] confusion but and I'm telling you damned
[3:53] 70 weeks is the most confusing doctrine
[3:56] in this message right that's where most
[3:59] people when they get off the the message
[4:02] rail car are the message crane the first
[4:05] thing they say is Brown didn't know what
[4:07] he's talking about when he said this
[4:08] over here he said this over there
[4:09] I mean calling people when when a group
[4:12] of people goes up north next is we
[4:17] believe in polygamy because brother
[4:19] Brown preached it you saw that we saw
[4:21] the video brother Trevor
[4:23] we saw the video they can friending with
[4:25] it right you know what they were reading
[4:26] and reading prayers Almanack right they
[4:30] were quoting Charles Stanley right they
[4:33] were quoting brother Ram what about this
[4:36] brother Brown said one quote that
[4:38] polygamy should be legal yeah but they
[4:42] don't read the rest of the quarters
[4:43] right we said let's not but they took
[4:47] that to them because it was a press play
[4:50] blow and there wasn't a preacher there
[4:54] that can help them with that's the thing
[4:57] so my heaven
[4:59] quote that's where that big city come
[5:07] break it down with me
[5:09] that's right and you know what it's like
[5:13] I said about about anything else we must
[5:19] realize this is supposed to happen this
[5:23] is supposed to happen but where's your
[5:26] faith my faith is that brother Graham
[5:30] brought the message button that's dumb
[5:32] because I believe that I don't have to
[5:34] have faith to run around with the
[5:35] Prophet I know he was there's no one
[5:38] menu at this event there's no one
[5:40] besides Jesus Christ ever walked on this
[5:42] earth that was as close to God in
[5:45] program right
[5:46] no one all the great man it doesn't
[5:49] matter who you want Medina all the great
[5:51] men brother Adam was right there that's
[5:53] why they call him Jesus Christ
[5:56] but I promise you somebody with a new
[6:00] burger will not call him God right don't
[6:04] God said I will not share my glory will
[6:07] no one no one so if you elevate him to
[6:11] Jesus Christ you're in trouble don't you
[6:14] do you make him an antichrist when you
[6:16] put something inserting something that's
[6:18] why said many weeks ago we can't insert
[6:21] brother Randall between us and Dinah
[6:23] there's only one mediator the man Christ
[6:28] Jesus and I said and we didn't become a
[6:33] son of God no son William Brown become
[6:36] something LEDs art did not go into the
[6:40] tent with Rebecca and I but he
[6:45] introduced Rebecca Kozik and then he
[6:48] went off the sink
[6:49] you don't care of him anymore hardly
[6:51] because he did his job he introduced the
[6:55] bride to Christ and to me that's the
[6:58] most simple see it's so simple people
[7:01] try to figure all this stuff out but see
[7:04] I don't have to have faith to program
[7:06] I already know that no any quote you
[7:08] hear me say these same like somebody
[7:10] said it I said the Seventh Seal one
[7:11] nothing I never said it I said if you
[7:15] don't believe it's open it's not if you
[7:21] don't believe it then it's not you
[7:23] caused it but if you believe in
[7:26] stainless steel oven but you gotta
[7:27] believe it's opened in that threefold
[7:28] manner home gobble any poor in Christ
[7:29] Christ in the church take her back to
[7:32] the Garden of Eden body Tang it's taking
[7:33] us back into another dimension and
[7:35] that's what work that we're facing now
[7:36] if you have Christ in your soul you
[7:38] don't have to go look for Christ that's
[7:39] what I said about that scripture Matthew
[7:42] 24 the reason I know I don't have to go
[7:46] somewhere else it's because Christ is
[7:50] here I don't have to go find him if you
[7:53] have to go find him you don't have it if
[7:57] you have to go looking for Christ
[7:58] because it's Christ in you the hope of
[8:00] glory that's just to me it just once
[8:04] it's broken down that's the most simple
[8:06] thing but but man's made it so
[8:10] complicated I do agree there is a bald
[8:12] spot full-member
[8:13] know that no doubt the devil has his own
[8:17] 500 men and they're at work okay but he
[8:23] does have a true five whole minutes
[8:24] because it says here I have faith that
[8:27] it's going to perfect the Saints which
[8:29] that attorney we have to go through
[8:48] they're barely healthy
[8:56] that research
[9:01] 58 59
[9:05] [Applause]
[9:26] if that'll turn away thy foot from the
[9:28] Sabbath from doing that pleasure on my
[9:30] holy day and call the Sabbath a delight
[9:31] the holy of the Lord are bullets you
[9:33] honor him not doing that own ways nor
[9:35] finding that home pleasure nor speaking
[9:37] that own words then shot them to life
[9:39] thou shall delight myself in the Lord
[9:42] and I will promise lead ride upon the
[9:44] high places of the earth and feed thee
[9:45] with a heritage subject up that father
[9:47] for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it
[9:50] that's good well even back during the
[9:56] law will go there I need this thing be
[9:58] even under the law remember that guy was
[10:01] picking up sticks on the Sabbath day I
[10:03] mean under the law he was killed what he
[10:05] wasn't doing what I'm told him to do he
[10:09] went in the tabernacle doing what God
[10:11] told them no me without doing whatever
[10:12] whatever so I mean it's just coming down
[10:16] folks I'm telling you there's gonna come
[10:20] a time I don't want to ever say these
[10:24] words I wish I would've I don't ever
[10:30] come to a time but I have to sit down by
[10:32] myself and say I wish I wouldn't write
[10:37] think about that everywhere you go think
[10:40] about I wish I would have done
[10:42] I wish out let's get the past I wish I
[10:45] wouldn't we need to have faith now if a
[10:47] brother grant preached on that
[10:49] they'll remember a couple years ago now
[10:52] face
[10:53] we got have now saying we don't need to
[10:55] have we can't have call space called
[10:58] already gone he's done he God we have
[11:00] faith in what Paul said cuz we know it
[11:02] was the Word of God
[11:03] same way we run around we know it was
[11:05] the Word of God but he's gone home it is
[11:07] left up to the fivefold ministry to
[11:11] bring this thing to a head like it or
[11:14] not that's God's program that's it and
[11:16] I'm not gonna mess with it
[11:33] [Music]
[11:35] you praise me go rob yeah we got your in
[11:46] [Music]
[11:54] that's right then remember us we're
[11:57] gonna be gone next Sunday to Arizona so
[12:01] we're late Friday won't be back - that's
[12:17] right yeah that's right
[12:19] they got brother royal coming in so they
[12:21] got the Baltimore in that's okay that's
[12:25] the Rachel Rachel Willis you can talk
[12:39] can you eat
[12:43] no you're not no man we were hoping for
[12:51] an adorable Rachel that would be not
[12:53] ever be normal what did they do y'all
[13:14] need to make enough
[13:16] See Mom and I said you're telling me
[13:20] that first son has got to have an
[13:23] appointment to come see his mother
[13:27] feasible if you don't want anybody else
[13:29] here and so please just pray for that
[13:34] it's going to get down the end of life
[13:39] there's always something fuzzy can
[13:40] Holloway somebody just call it fuzzy
[13:43] it's just it always okay then I'll
[13:44] become fuzzy you know be clear now
[13:47] become a little bit fuzzy yeah well you
[13:49] know how that is stuff going through it
[13:52] now all right let's go we were we kind
[13:56] of went down the past this but let's
[13:59] back up and read this and then we'll
[14:01] start with Hebrews 11 and let us
[14:04] consider one another to provoke unto
[14:06] love and to good works and that's Paul
[14:12] speaking cooks here now not forsaking
[14:14] the assembling of ourselves together as
[14:15] the manner of some is but exhorting one
[14:17] another and so much more as you see the
[14:19] Day approaching
[14:22] but then the reason that that we read
[14:26] this and we keep quoting it is because
[14:29] you see there I'm just going to make it
[14:34] plain as I can make it okay
[14:39] I don't want to make a distant plain as
[14:41] I can make it if you're not going to
[14:42] church now more than you are if you have
[14:45] no more desire now than you did two
[14:47] years ago you're lost you just don't
[14:50] have the baptism and all of that you did
[14:53] not I just read the Bible if you have no
[14:58] more desire I don't you know you say
[15:00] well I got this no that didn't ask for a
[15:03] laundry list it says not forsaking the
[15:06] assembling of ourselves together as the
[15:08] manner of some it cuz you know what you
[15:10] get week right
[15:11] you get week you won't if you're looking
[15:14] at me and saying you don't get leaked
[15:15] you're lying
[15:16] cuz you're lying to this you get weaker
[15:20] because we are sheep sheep are herd
[15:22] animals right and they have to be herded
[15:27] by a shepherd then you Shepherd is not
[15:31] one that stays at the house the Shepherd
[15:35] is always with me chief but now what if
[15:38] the Sheep don't show up the wolves even
[15:42] because being a herd animal you stay in
[15:45] a herd it's self protection exactly they
[15:48] expect that's what we're doing with self
[15:49] protecting each other but this says not
[15:52] forsaking the assembling of ourselves
[15:53] together as the manner of some is you
[15:58] can sit here and preach it and reach in
[15:59] preaching next study some of y'all said
[16:01] in this room will be in I'm not talking
[16:02] about you going somewhere
[16:03] I meant dog huh well we're gonna be here
[16:06] but we got a job to do nothing we're
[16:08] gonna set Holloman said well I don't
[16:09] wait I'll just watch it today because a
[16:11] big toe hurts or my cat staggered and so
[16:16] much more as you see the Day approaching
[16:18] that's the blindness member of the rest
[16:21] doctor we're talking yesterday about it
[16:22] no Friday
[16:24] he so desires to be in the church but
[16:27] there's none within miles of him to
[16:29] preach the truth miles I'm done 101 I'm
[16:33] talking like three hours away that
[16:35] really preached the treatment message so
[16:38] he has to watch but he didn't watch it's
[16:41] like these days and I you know I don't
[16:42] watch him my slipper
[16:43] I got copied so I really try to make it
[16:45] an atmosphere all the church service but
[16:49] now we have no excuse you can have one
[16:54] but this one doesn't does look for if we
[16:58] sin willfully after we've received the
[17:00] knowledge of the fifth so see you're
[17:01] aware you've been aware we've all been
[17:03] aware we've all been aware of this
[17:05] scripture right here it was written in
[17:07] of the year 80 60 something 50 something
[17:11] yeah okay 2000 years ago this scripture
[17:14] was written and we've been reading over
[17:17] left
[17:30] Sherman believe that's really what
[17:33] helped me you know I'll do all the
[17:35] things that I want to ensure for his
[17:37] being able to talk again when I
[17:39] [Music]
[17:43] see that's why it is instilled in all of
[17:46] us there was no even when we were in a
[17:47] bad with church being eight nine years
[17:49] old I can remember you didn't schedule
[17:52] nothing on something if you did if
[17:56] somebody else schedule something they
[17:58] went in you did like I said by Jenny's
[18:01] dad he used to show up on Saturday night
[18:03] sometime of course we can't go to church
[18:05] at the time look for fine but now you
[18:08] don't show up on Saturday night if he
[18:09] does he knows he's going to set there
[18:10] Sunday by itself or he can go it there's
[18:13] no question he said I know y'all go to
[18:15] church they know Wayne tonight he'll
[18:17] come very close sometimes here so yeah
[18:20] but it's what you show what but what if
[18:21] you would it but listen some of you do
[18:24] it you're sitting here some of you do it
[18:25] you kids come in from out of town
[18:26] laughter now I say lay out that means
[18:29] lay out could you lay it out that's
[18:31] right here
[18:31] did you scripture because what you're
[18:34] doing is you're telling the kids they're
[18:36] more important minister they're more
[18:38] important than you going to church that
[18:39] never will happen in my life never will
[18:43] happen in my life that my kids or my
[18:45] family will take over what this church
[18:48] takes over no listen you said what if
[18:50] somebody dies come on people I'm done by
[18:53] just a regular visit from your team it's
[18:56] your babies
[18:57] well you're lost you don't have enough
[19:01] Holy Ghost to get you to church because
[19:03] the Holy Ghost will come to church now
[19:05] brother Brown I'm saying you can't wait
[19:07] through the doors
[19:07] see we forget those scriptures and we go
[19:10] well we can do that no we can get those
[19:12] goods but right here's the 1i it doesn't
[19:14] I probably didn't have to come to tell
[19:19] and even like I said before we may go to
[19:23] the extreme but even that's going to
[19:26] Illinois and I found it's the church in
[19:27] between that we can go to church we're
[19:31] not gonna knock the dirt we're going to
[19:32] turn somewhere even at our vacations we
[19:35] found message churches and found places
[19:36] that we can
[19:37] Church even more on vacation now to me
[19:40] that may be a little bit extreme if you
[19:41] have the vacation schedule you're out in
[19:44] Colorado on Sunday then you don't have
[19:48] excuse I just said Colorado man customs
[19:54] department and reminds you I excuse me
[19:56] turbo even though it believes whatever
[20:00] it believed that very subtle jerk but
[20:03] you still you see what I'm saying
[20:05] because we are sheep right
[20:07] I would weaken myself if I didn't think
[20:10] I needed to go to Turkey you don't think
[20:12] you need to go to church then you are
[20:14] lost you are just this same and I don't
[20:18] want that I want in this section because
[20:20] look if we sin willfully this is the
[20:23] whole statement if we sin willfully
[20:25] after I stood up here and told you this
[20:28] this morning you know what they say
[20:32] after you've received the knowledge of
[20:34] the truth there remaineth no more
[20:35] sacrifice for sins but a certain fearful
[20:37] looking for a judgment for of judgment
[20:40] and fiery indignation which will devour
[20:42] the adversaries sheep have to be fed
[20:47] they do have a shepherd and we have to
[20:53] assemble ourselves together good but
[20:59] look but a certain fearful looking for
[21:00] of judgment and fiery indignation which
[21:02] shall devour the adversaries he that
[21:07] despised Moses law died without mercy
[21:09] under two or three witnesses in other
[21:12] words the law was weak and even though
[21:14] the law was weak Moses is law said
[21:20] assemble yourself together that's right
[21:23] Israel knew when the church doors were
[21:26] open they needed to go alright that's
[21:30] what I'm telling you you you just you
[21:32] just don't have the Holy Ghost if you
[21:33] don't want to go to track
[21:35] you just don't have that I'm sorry you
[21:37] maybe you're justified sanctified
[21:39] foolish version but if you don't really
[21:43] in your heart feel you got to go to
[21:45] church you can come over though right
[21:48] you may fool yourself all these years
[21:50] but you know gonna flow God because of
[21:52] that stricter right there because listen
[21:57] that revelation was to me not long ago
[22:00] as you see the Day approaching the
[22:03] problem is that's the revelation to me
[22:06] cuz I see the Day approaching people
[22:08] they don't go to church they don't see
[22:09] the Day approaching thanks I was just
[22:11] like just brother labo day look they're
[22:13] talking you know they just they hammer
[22:14] on this come to church now you know what
[22:16] you're lost you're lost you have to do
[22:21] something about it
[22:21] yeah till I brother their original
[22:23] salvation let's just don't get saved
[22:25] it'll be funny cuz I say people don't go
[22:29] to turf save people go journey that's
[22:33] running okay I'm just you know what you
[22:36] can like say you can put your laundry
[22:38] list of mind you can't get here it just
[22:41] ain't gonna work with God because you
[22:45] know what I'm fearful and it's like I
[22:49] told you Sundy you're my family more
[22:52] than my family outside now I have a
[22:53] better opportunity something you could
[22:55] my family love them here I don't talk
[22:57] about my outside family they're not
[22:59] worth me staying out of church to see
[23:01] them because they're not spirit-filled
[23:03] people right they're not somebody I want
[23:06] to commune with what gets me is like
[23:09] what mom said you know you you retired
[23:12] people they're off all week they ain't

[23:16] then I'll show you they gonna go visit
[23:18] somebody come on good gonna wait that's
[23:22] why your priorities are not right that's
[23:24] right come on tell me if I was retired

[23:29] that we go
[23:30] we go Tuesday we were not going away
[23:32] anything we would not go inside me I
[23:33] can't believe people did that but today
[23:40] exactly you know why you're on here
[23:44] because the holy ghost wants to hear
[23:46] right when you don't come here we want
[23:48] to hear you don't have the Holy Ghost oh
[23:49] there's nothing to respond to I'm
[23:52] telling you it's narrowing down
[23:54] it's narrowing down and the narrowing
[23:59] down is whether remember you come to
[24:02] that place
[24:03] brother Brown says got to tell you one
[24:05] more time then you won't take any more
[24:08] and that raised your age you're gonna
[24:10] follow up one side and just keep them
[24:12] one on this direction or are you gonna
[24:15] stay on that rage of the day right yes
[24:29] [Music]
[24:36] we're being fed buckets full here so I
[24:39] just thank God for that Bob needs to be
[24:44] careful with it hoarders liens d-nice
[24:49] you're what you said you said I made it
[24:51] for the same sale I've been made it so
[24:52] planned we'll just live and you can
[24:55] understand it you - I'm glad you're all
[25:13] right
[25:16] but it is plain Ryan sent me a big email
[25:19] I'm going to give him a pickle atta boy
[25:21] sent me a long email about how the
[25:23] Seventh Seal he did not think he could
[25:25] attain to it because it's been so great
[25:27] and so big it's so huge and so external
[25:32] we're now all I'm teaching is is it's
[25:34] already inside of you and that's what
[25:36] the whole thing is it's you
[25:39] Christ in you though Michael exactly
[25:43] it's a cyclic that we went out and we've
[25:46] got we've got all these great
[25:48] revelations but what he's gonna do is
[25:50] gonna come right back to where brother
[25:51] Brown when he stood on that Seventh Seal
[25:52] it was Christ he can preach anything
[25:55] else he just told about his journey in
[25:58] about his wail that Lord led him to
[26:01] different lanes and and he talked about
[26:03] his salvation we'll see that to me
[26:04] that's the seventh sale so see what I'm
[26:10] saying is those who have the seventh
[26:14] seal opens of them I don't have to sit
[26:16] here pound on hair and grass and come
[26:19] into church something's not open if it's
[26:24] open to a group of people and it's not
[26:27] open to another group of people then
[26:30] people ain't got what this group's got
[26:31] right okay so I made this one of
[26:34] maintenance I'm sorry to be this plane
[26:36] but I've been I've been thinking about
[26:38] it all week about all the things that
[26:40] even gone here and it happened to their
[26:42] church they slide brother clock said
[26:45] this is he's got a lot of wisdom bruh
[26:47] clock said anybody come to church Sunday
[26:49] morning he said but the real believers
[26:53] come back Sunday afternoon and the real
[26:55] real believers come a wink tonight yeah
[26:58] it kind of leads all the others out and
[27:03] that it does I mean you like said you
[27:05] can use whatever excuse you want to
[27:06] but that's exactly true because anybody
[27:09] can come to church home anymore
[27:10] that's really easy well for something
[27:14] but Sunday afternoon it gets a little
[27:16] bit harder to come basically here but
[27:19] that's your faithful and then Wednesday
[27:21] night is your real faithful because
[27:22] there's only a smaller group and if you
[27:23] don't come a win tonight thank you I'm
[27:25] talking to you sorry I'm just telling
[27:30] you what the Bible said than what God
[27:32] put in my heart to say so if you think
[27:34] it's the devil then I'd be careful but a
[27:37] certain fearful looking for of judgment
[27:39] and fiery indignation which shall devour
[27:42] the devour of the adversary he just
[27:46] stopped despised Moses law died without
[27:48] mercy under two or three witnesses let
[27:49] me tell you something else
[27:50] Lorne kind of put on my heart and say I
[27:53] say it now there is going to be a time
[27:57] when we can't get in together but it's
[28:00] not matter your cars cost as much of
[28:04] your first passing if you buy a new car
[28:06] your car is going to cost as much as
[28:08] your perfect house with me and you and
[28:10] got married
[28:10] our house is $30,000 you buy a new car
[28:12] now story job dollars for a basic four
[28:15] wheels in their condition so we're not
[28:20] in it we're not work yeah well we can't
[28:23] go back to looking we're back to my
[28:27] laces anyway I just
[28:35] that's okay but what happened is that
[28:38] what I'm saying is is you say well what
[28:41] will that squeeze company they ain't
[28:42] here yet I'm gonna pack it in just as
[28:46] much as I can pack it in every Wednesday
[28:48] every Sunday every time we have a church
[28:50] service I'm gonna pack it in because one
[28:53] day we might not be able come together
[28:55] as a group we might have to meet out in
[28:58] the woods or anybody it ain't happening
[28:59] man I think somebody's been a little
[29:02] some people are a little premature they
[29:03] starting now but there will come a time
[29:09] so you said well what about that script
[29:13] or the last scriptures don't go away but
[29:15] you know what even if it's you and your
[29:16] wife right and you can't get to church
[29:19] you two or three are gathered in my name
[29:21] I'll be in the minute that's not you and
[29:24] your wife said hello we have a church
[29:25] near that's not that's not Bible and
[29:29] that's not good rounds missing okay so
[29:32] you said well you know you can use the
[29:34] excuse you want it it's like I said you
[29:37] got all this time to do this other stuff
[29:39] and you don't have time come Church
[29:40] couple back yeah but you go take
[29:45] vacations and trips knowledge but you
[29:46] don't mind come turn please people good
[29:48] grief that's faith you know what it is
[29:51] you don't have enough faith if you get
[29:53] scared off take care of me I know it you
[29:56] know y'all gonna go upstairs and he
[29:57] gonna feel a little look a little raw
[29:59] but other than that maybe jewel love
[30:02] bring something into just put some
[30:04] jewelry I'm gonna be real surprised if
[30:11] he don't mention something about this in
[30:14] the service because it's been so
[30:16] pressing only this week
[30:20] we got to get on this channel how much
[30:24] sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be
[30:27] that word they thought worthy who hath
[30:30] trodden under foot something you know
[30:31] what isn't saying he that despised Moses
[30:34] law this was lawful do's and dont's died
[30:39] without mercy under two or three
[30:41] witnesses in other words what's he's
[30:42] saying how much more this man will come
[30:46] and die for you on a cross and it's like
[30:49] June always says about witnessing to
[30:51] people they say well what this
[30:52] long-haired thing
[30:53] Jim said look if God can come down in
[30:56] human flesh hanging on the cross driving
[30:58] nails through his hand pierced his side
[31:00] naked on a cross died for me me wearing
[31:04] long hair is nothing it's mine trying to
[31:09] give back trying to give back in a
[31:12] feeble way but trying to give back
[31:14] something to this man that came and I'm
[31:17] forced to do and have counted the blood
[31:19] of the Covenant wherewith he was
[31:21] sanctified an unholy thing that's what I
[31:25] said
[31:26] call this really he did exactly but I'm
[31:28] kidding if you don't assemble yourself
[31:31] together you have no words you have
[31:34] drugged Moses as long throwed it out but
[31:36] you've also why do you think brother
[31:38] Adam let's think about this over there
[31:40] why do you think brother Brennan had
[31:41] preached indictment what did he indict
[31:43] he indicted this generation for putting
[31:45] Christ back on the cross for the sake of
[31:48] crucifixion of Christ but you know why
[31:51] he had to be he had to be so that
[31:54] Matthew 17 can come fast at the Son of
[31:57] man be risen again where's he risen
[31:59] again in us that's why we don't do what
[32:02] they do out there
[32:04] that's why we don't know shouldn't have
[32:09] anyway so how much more so replenishment
[32:12] how much more store replacement should
[32:15] we be punished if we count this new
[32:17] covenant wherein he died for an unholy
[32:21] thing okay that's just burning my
[32:26] bridges right here
[32:28] well not your sister but you counted on
[32:32] a holy thing and hath done despite unto
[32:34] the spirit of grace for we know him that
[32:40] has said vengeance belongeth unto me
[32:42] that's done I will recompense saith the
[32:44] Lord and again the Lord shall judge his
[32:47] people it is a fearful thing to fall
[32:50] into the hands of a living God like I
[32:55] said before I've been reading through
[32:56] kings and I'm into Jobe now man read
[32:58] book of Job jobs a stroke right jobs our
[33:02] struggle even those three guys that come
[33:04] to him they just weren't his friends
[33:05] that came that poor they were going jobs
[33:11] like but then you see that last one
[33:15] coming you see the last one which tops
[33:18] Christ you see that last one come and he
[33:20] brings everything aligned it right back
[33:22] up right and even Joe even job had to go
[33:27] just one day he just didn't take I'm
[33:29] just I'm just I'm just a fool I should
[33:33] have never been born you know but then
[33:36] he comes back and says but God in other
[33:38] words who is rich in mercy has brought
[33:40] me to this place and brought me and sent
[33:42] me and what did what did what did God do
[33:44] for Joe at the very end you see what
[33:47] happens if you do just a little bit of
[33:49] due diligence to what God said Joe gave
[33:53] God gave Joe back all of this family
[33:57] doubled everything you have even this
[33:59] family come she got seven in heaven and
[34:01] he got seven more kids he had ten
[34:03] thousand kavithai giving 20,000 Kevin I
[34:06] mean he was twice is better off but you
[34:08] have it but remember he had settled at
[34:10] that sheep brother walk and come harder
[34:12] and scrape the boiled off of his body
[34:14] now that was me and that mean you going
[34:17] through our trials and tribulation so
[34:19] look what the job is
[34:20] if you'll just analyze it and just
[34:23] remember that that the three guys that
[34:25] was talking to him it's kind of devilish
[34:28] they're you know they're saying told you
[34:29] did something wrong you know secretly
[34:32] you jump like no and then Joe finally he
[34:37] puts the state that I know my Redeemer
[34:38] liveth he saw revelation something
[34:40] happens where he knew there was a man
[34:42] that was going to come in human flesh
[34:44] and then was going to take everything
[34:46] and redeem him back now if you can see
[34:49] that and a job is the oldest book of the
[34:51] Bible so he didn't Abraham went in here
[34:53] yet Moses wasn't here yet he was written
[34:56] right after the flood so there what many
[34:59] people on the earth but Joel was the
[35:01] real good guy you know and he did
[35:04] sacrifices and he tried to do his best
[35:06] he had to come from the lineage of one
[35:08] of the hams hammered a path we know
[35:10] probably went ham the levels of evil
[35:14] part challenge a path so he come from
[35:15] good stock
[35:17] but remember one thing's for sure God
[35:22] took Satan's attention and put it onto
[35:26] Satan didn't just go looking for Joker
[35:30] same way with me and you if we're going
[35:33] through a trauma tribulation God man
[35:37] said Satan you you considered my servant
[35:40] he said servant go have you considered
[35:43] my servant
[35:43] but remember job all the way through
[35:46] that at the very end he never denied his
[35:48] faith right don't want to destroy this
[35:53] body in my flesh I shall see God he was
[35:56] point in several thousand years to the
[35:58] resurrection and so that's what we got
[36:00] to look forward to but just the book of
[36:01] Job I had written a long time so but
[36:05] remember back in kings and sang on all
[36:08] that if the people would do God do good
[36:10] God would bless them the people would do
[36:12] matters I wouldn't listen right okay the
[36:17] caller in much the former days in which
[36:19] after you were illuminated your endured
[36:21] a great fight of afflictions partly
[36:24] whilst you were made of gazing stopped
[36:25] both by reproaches
[36:27] an affliction my job and us partly
[36:31] whilst you became companions of them
[36:34] that were so used for you have
[36:37] compassion of being my bondage Don about
[36:39] his problems now to come about Paul
[36:40] being in prison itself and to enjoy
[36:42] Philebus pausing every good knowing in
[36:45] yourself that you have in heaven a
[36:46] better and enduring substance same way
[36:51] here I mean we we do the best we can
[36:53] with what we got but my heavens would
[36:55] you want to own this place right now at
[36:58] the moment that we're talking about
[36:59] would you want to own the earth no you
[37:01] would not and we can't clean it off by
[37:05] our individual self but we have to
[37:08] depend on God through us and then he's
[37:12] going to get us out of here and then
[37:13] he's gonna lock the whole thing and then
[37:15] bring us right back into here what a
[37:16] great God cast not away therefore your
[37:19] confidence which has great recompense of
[37:22] reward cast not away your confidence
[37:26] Bob of talking about confidence and
[37:28] determination and all that's why if
[37:31] you've got confidence in door then to me
[37:35] that just that just let's think about
[37:38] Wednesday night it just takes your faith
[37:40] and it just explodes it because I have
[37:43] confidence not just that I've got to
[37:46] come to church every single young stance
[37:48] you say you got yourself dragon caroling
[37:50] tonight dreams been here in 20 years you
[37:51] grab yourself instead now and go a lot
[37:53] sure Lucy I said that son because I sure
[37:56] don't want to be here don't come that
[37:58] means you're lost that thinks you don't
[38:02] have to all go but if you'll come in and
[38:06] go god this is gonna help me every time
[38:09] which has a great recompense of reward
[38:13] for ye have need of patience that after
[38:16] you have done the will of God
[38:19] everybody's won't doctor come on the
[38:22] scene and give us promises and give us
[38:23] this and give us that give us the other
[38:28] after you have done the will of God you
[38:33] might receive the promise for yet a
[38:36] little while and he that shall come will
[38:37] come and will not tarry now the just
[38:40] shall live by faith
[38:41] but if any man draw back my soul shall
[38:44] have no pleasure in it he's quoting the
[38:46] Old Testament all right but if they may
[38:49] draw back my soul shall have no pleasure
[38:52] in him but we are not of them who draw
[38:55] back unto perdition our sin or hell but
[38:59] of them that believe to the saving of
[39:03] the soul all right now now faith is the
[39:10] substance of things are you see what I
[39:12] mean about the letter that Paul wrote
[39:13] it's just a continuous writing till you
[39:16] go back to 11 of 1000 always at the
[39:19] bottom but we are not of them which draw
[39:22] back unto perdition but of them that
[39:24] believe to the saving of the soul now
[39:28] faith is the substance of things hoped
[39:30] for the evidence of things not seen
[39:34] now faith is the substance of things
[39:37] hoped for because remember you're not
[39:40] hoping to be a church today you don't
[39:43] have a faith that you're coming to
[39:44] Sunday school you had faith in your
[39:46] journey that you were getting to
[39:49] Sunday's Google once you get here it's
[39:51] no more faith right that's why the Bible
[39:54] will continue to read them because look
[39:56] once you come to something you don't
[39:59] have to have faith in that anymore
[40:01] if I received the baptism of the Holy
[40:04] Ghost in my soul I don't have to have
[40:05] faith in God some same exact
[40:11] so if faith is kind of like faith to me
[40:13] is like repentance Lord forgive me what
[40:16] I'm going to do tomorrow
[40:17] no that's not what repentance a
[40:18] repentance is what you do it so faith is
[40:22] the same way
[40:23] faith is looking back to what the
[40:24] journey is and it brings you up here now
[40:26] you think them go away but what what
[40:29] we're going to read in just a little
[40:30] while it says from faith to faith that's
[40:34] what Paul is going to tell us them a
[40:36] little while leaving the principles of
[40:39] the doctrine of Christ a laying on of
[40:41] hands and a water baptism and of all
[40:43] they plant I don't need to be baptized
[40:45] again I have faith that the baptism and
[40:48] I have took care of that so I don't have
[40:50] to say well I wondered now if you wonder
[40:51] you need to go back get settled that my
[40:55] brother Gramps didn't take that state
[40:56] and drop it down say Satan right here
[40:58] this is where I was baptizing them Lord
[41:02] Jesus Christ I went through everything
[41:04] you told me to go through done now I'm
[41:06] gonna have faithful but I see don't go
[41:09] back next week do the same thing you've
[41:12] lost something or you never gain
[41:13] something that's what it was what I'm
[41:14] saying about the same thing with faith
[41:16] for being healed paid for being healed
[41:19] comes inside of you this is what brother
[41:21] Branham tells people over and over and
[41:24] over again he tells them it's your faith
[41:29] that operates together right not him
[41:31] it's your faith they're not racing you
[41:33] brother around couldn't heal nobody they
[41:37] had to have faith even brother man
