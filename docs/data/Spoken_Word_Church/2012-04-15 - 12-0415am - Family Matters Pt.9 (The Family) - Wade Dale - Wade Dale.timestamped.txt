[3:21] be a little a little awkward but still
[3:25] we got to realize that um the old saying
[3:28] is and it's just a good saying is if you
[3:32] don't
[3:35] plan then your plan will always fail
[3:37] yeah if you fail the plan your plan will
[3:40] always fail cuz you don't make a plan
[3:42] you're going to fail right you say well
[3:44] this is too much like like school well
[3:47] you know what the only way that God got
[3:49] to us was to send us prophets right
[3:53] teachers men to teach us what do you
[3:55] think they teaching us right they're
[3:57] teaching us the way the plan didn't is
[4:01] it called The Plan of Redemption amen
[4:03] amen called The Plan of Redemption so
[4:05] let's don't be so hard on say well we
[4:07] need to plan you need to plan everything
[4:10] right you know it's a lot better to plan
[4:12] things like we're planning all these
[4:13] things here that uh that Terence is is
[4:16] telling us it's a surprise if we don't
[4:19] plan but if we plan it's never a

[8:16] you would just be with us be with the

[8:25] Forth we pray that you would just
[8:26] manifest yourself Lord bless us today
[8:29] and be with us in Jesus Christ's name we
[8:30] pray amen Genesis 1:26 and 27 and God
[8:34] said let us make man in our image now
[8:37] see this is let us make man
[8:40] right go let us make man now my question
[8:44] is is why didn't God just keep creating
[8:46] from the dust like he did
[8:48] Adam he wouldn't have been a father he
[8:51] needed a family he wanted a family a
[8:53] family unit listen God said let us make
[8:56] man in our image after our likeness
[8:59] and let them amen now there's the
[9:02] there's the foundation for the family
[9:04] them right not God right them he gives
[9:09] them a charge right to multiply see and
[9:13] let them have dominion over the fish of
[9:15] the Sea and the foul of the air and over
[9:16] cattle and over all the earth look what
[9:18] he's given this unit over every creeping
[9:21] thing that creepeth upon the Earth so
[9:22] God created man in his own image and the
[9:25] image of God created in him male and
[9:27] female cre created he them now I'm going
[9:30] to read 28 and God blessed them and God
[9:33] said unto them be fruitful and multiply
[9:37] and it's not up there I forgot to put it
[9:38] on there and replenish the Earth amen
[9:42] multiply and replenish the Earth be
[9:45] fruitful so he's giving them a charge
[9:48] whoever they were in Genesis 1 he was
[9:51] giving them a charge to multiply and
[9:53] replenish the Earth subdue it and have
[9:55] dominion over the fish of the Sea and
[9:57] the foul of the air and every living
[9:58] creature and that moveth upon the earth
[10:00] now let's go to Genesis 9 verse
[10:05] 1 this is after the destruction the
[10:08] first thing God tells Noah when he comes
[10:10] out of the
[10:12] ark Noah Builds an
[10:15] ark sacrifices to the
[10:18] Lord told him that the imagination of
[10:21] men's Hearts was evil from his youth
[10:22] that's the ones that died in the
[10:24] flood and God blessed Noah his sons and
[10:27] said unto them be fruit
[10:30] and multiply and replenish the Earth you
[10:33] may be see it the Lord his Blessing now
[10:35] remember last Sunday we talked about the
[10:37] spiritual multiplication of a family how
[10:40] God was going to what he was going to
[10:44] create his own generation right all
[10:46] right because he was cut off from among
[10:48] the land of the living last Sunday right
[10:50] right from his generation he was going
[10:52] to be cut off his
[10:53] genealogy was going to be cut off but
[10:56] you and I are the ones that makes this
[10:59] generation continue on when we get the
[11:01] new birth and God bursts his own life in
[11:04] us we become children of the almighty
[11:07] amen all right we become children of God
[11:09] and today I want you to realize now that
[11:11] that was given the charge was given to
[11:14] you and I to multiply and replenish the
[11:16] Earth amen not God right he gave the
[11:19] charge to us amen he didn't say I'm
[11:22] going to multiply we know he is we know
[11:24] he's the author but he's G you and I
[11:27] something to do with he told them to
[11:29] multiply see therefore now he's G us
[11:31] something to do amen so now we got
[11:33] something to do with it he's not just
[11:35] the almighty sure he's the almighty God
[11:38] but he
[11:39] wanted a family he wanted children amen
[11:43] he wanted somebody to worship Him God's
[11:46] intentions were from the beginning to
[11:48] bring children into this world Amen
[11:50] spoken word not by saxs but spoken word
[11:53] and woman was created to bring forth
[11:56] those children amen she wasn't just to
[11:58] help me just to be there right right no
[12:01] that was a man with a womb Adam didn't
[12:04] have a womb right Eve had a womb when
[12:06] she come out from Adam she was woman all
[12:09] right and I like U brother Daniel and
[12:12] Brother Joseph I can't I think last
[12:13] Sunday got everybody to kind of thinking
[12:15] about things which is
[12:17] good cuz if you really pulled apart
[12:20] everything that happened in the Garden
[12:21] of Eden right there in the beginning of
[12:22] time in the Book of Genesis you spend an
[12:24] eternity talking about the the little
[12:26] details that happened during the during
[12:29] the time but but I I like what brother
[12:31] Daniel said and I kind of was thinking
[12:33] on the same thing that you said well why
[12:35] didn't Adam just have Eve
[12:37] destroyed and start over with what
[12:41] exactly right that's right the feminist
[12:45] part of he would have had to created
[12:46] another Adam to take a feminine Spirit
[12:49] out of but he didn't say that see that's
[12:51] part of what I was talking about last
[12:52] Sunday and then now God didn't do that
[12:54] that will be this complimentary to God
[12:56] having a family right he created out ad
[12:59] and said you do it right cuz when he
[13:02] gives us a new birth he says you do it
[13:04] amen I'm going to do it through you but
[13:06] you're going to do it you got something
[13:07] to do with that so he couldn't have took
[13:10] another Eve out of Adam he'd already
[13:12] took the woman the feminine Spirit out
[13:13] of out of Adam so there's no way that he
[13:16] could have got rid of Eve without God
[13:18] killing both of them right right so she
[13:21] was protected because of him right and
[13:24] then he protected his genealogy just
[13:26] like we said by doing what he did he
[13:28] finished you went on and did what he was
[13:29] doing and he knew what he was doing Adam
[13:32] was not dumb right Adam was a Son of God
[13:35] he was Christ on the
[13:37] earth he had the mind of Christ right he
[13:41] didn't have a a muddled up mind like me
[13:43] and you got cuz he wasn't born in sin
[13:46] shaping iniquity spous on our mother's
[13:48] womb he didn't have two persons or two
[13:51] or old Adam and new Adam in him he was
[13:53] just
[13:54] Adam but what he done was is to
[13:57] to
[13:59] protect his
[14:02] genealogy but also to make sure that Eve
[14:05] wasn't killed
[14:07] because he would had to
[14:09] took Moses yeah if he' to kill the
[14:13] children of Israel yeah right go back to
[14:16] our types Moses type Christ God couldn't
[14:18] kill Israel because of Moses right so
[14:22] God couldn't kill Eve because of Adam
[14:24] standing there he never took care of
[14:25] both of them and started all over again
[14:27] that's what not what he said he said you
[14:29] do it you multiply you replenish the
[14:32] Earth so now let's go to Genesis
[14:37] 2 brother Anderson's flying solo back
[14:39] there so brother Joe's up here in the
[14:41] front which is good I like
[14:44] that Genesis 2: 23-24 and Adam said this
[14:48] is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My
[14:50] Flesh she shall be called woman not Eve
[14:53] woman why because she was going to
[14:55] reproduce Adam remember we read in
[14:57] Genesis 5 there where says that their
[14:59] name were Adam their name was Adam right
[15:03] she shall be called woman because she
[15:05] was taken out of man therefore shall a
[15:07] man leave his father and mother and
[15:09] shall cleave unto his
[15:12] wife wife yeah like brother Dale was
[15:16] talking about not not mistress or shck
[15:18] up his wife all right and they shall be
[15:21] one flesh you can't truly be one flesh
[15:23] unless you're born again right we know
[15:25] that you cannot truly be born again and
[15:29] that's what we're going to talk about
[15:30] this afternoon excuse me with some of
[15:32] the the young uh gentlemen and ladies
[15:35] that are that are looking for a mate
[15:37] brother B says do not marry
[15:40] unbelievers cuz you'll always have
[15:41] problems right now let's go to Genesis 3
[15:45] 16 unto the woman he said I will greatly
[15:47] multiply thy sorrow and thy conception
[15:50] and sorrow Thou shalt bring forth
[15:51] children and thy desire shall be to thy
[15:53] husband and he shall rule over thee now
[15:56] we already covered this in the woman
[15:57] part and in the double Covenant part
[16:00] this is where the double Covenant part
[16:01] comes in where she has to now be ruled
[16:04] over but he didn't do away with the
[16:06] having baby thing right you shall bring
[16:09] forth children in sorrow you'll bring
[16:11] forth children and thy desire shall be
[16:13] to thy husband and he shall rule over
[16:16] thee and then the generations of of Adam
[16:19] begun and we see the same thing with you
[16:21] and I that when we to get married and
[16:23] have family we too should become one
[16:26] flesh and we should prepare ourselves
[16:29] for having a family now if you don't
[16:32] have children then I don't ask I don't
[16:35] know I don't know but I'm just telling
[16:37] you what the Bible said the Bible said
[16:39] that God made us to have family all
[16:41] right he made a woman to have a baby by
[16:44] all right so there's no way around that
[16:46] there's no way getting through it or
[16:48] about it sisters you're the only ones
[16:50] and I've always said us men if we ever
[16:52] were supposed to birth children we would
[16:53] have had just
[16:55] one we would have never had another one
[16:58] right so yall are designed to do that
[17:00] you're designed to to Bear children
[17:02] that's why God wanted spoken word
[17:04] children he wanted children to be born
[17:07] right but he wanted to be done by the
[17:09] spoken word but since Satan came in and
[17:11] did what he did caused Eve to do what
[17:14] she did that caused God to like I said
[17:17] last Sunday bring us down into
[17:19] permissive well God permitted now our
[17:21] bodies to come in by the way we we all
[17:24] come same way amen we all come same way
[17:27] everybody that's building come the same
[17:29] identical way all right so you know
[17:32] doesn't matter if if your Mom and Daddy
[17:34] weren't married it doesn't matter how
[17:35] you it doesn't matter you came the same
[17:37] way all right so you came the same way
[17:39] we all it's not a a mystery to to know
[17:43] that we were supposed to come this way
[17:45] because we did come this way and we all
[17:47] come the same way all right like brother
[17:49] Brown said it may be on a a park bench
[17:51] somewhere or in a flowery beautiful pink
[17:53] room a birth is a mess and that's the
[17:55] way it's supposed to come and that's the
[17:56] way you're going to come all right so
[17:58] but in preparing for a family and for a
[18:01] family unit listen to quote number
[18:06] one what brought you in the first place
[18:09] dust Thou Art sin crept in and we had to
[18:12] go we're still God will never be
[18:15] defeated see Satan thought he could stop
[18:17] a Son of God from being born he just
[18:19] prolonged it a little bit right all
[18:21] right he didn't stoping you're not going
[18:23] to stop God that's where the foolish
[18:25] part of of Satan is he thinks he can
[18:27] defeat God right and God's the one that
[18:29] made him so he's deceived and you know
[18:32] what he's doing he's trying to make you
[18:33] deceived God will never be defeated he
[18:36] expected this Earth to be inhabited in
[18:38] Isaiah about 40 or somewhere in there it
[18:40] says I made the Earth to be inhabited
[18:42] now that's the Eternal Word of God so it
[18:45] can't change so that's why that we had
[18:47] to have a Prophet come and tell us that
[18:49] we're not going to go live on some Cloud
[18:51] somewhere we're not going to go to some
[18:52] heaven to live God created this Earth to
[18:54] be inhabited Eternal so this is where
[18:57] we're going to live know right he
[19:00] expected this Earth to be inhabited so
[19:02] he just made woman to bring children he
[19:05] still pours the calcium and potach and
[19:07] elements into them and build them up we
[19:10] don't have anything to doing with
[19:11] building the body we just do the ACT
[19:14] that's right right and brother brandom
[19:16] said it's much more
[19:18] mysterious this kind of birth than it
[19:21] was the Immaculate Conception cuz it was
[19:23] one germ one EG one egg one germ one
[19:27] Christ
[19:29] us Millions thousands hundreds of
[19:31] thousands like I said last Sunday
[19:33] Generations back and
[19:35] forth I mean you know what I'm talking
[19:37] about right how'd you get
[19:39] here God you still didn't defeat God's
[19:41] purpose Satan didn't defeat he's not
[19:43] going to stop a Son of God from being
[19:44] born right Satan that is then he brings
[19:48] him to a place and lets you make a
[19:49] choice that's why you're
[19:51] here make a choice and if without a
[19:55] choice God made you one day a young man
[19:57] strong happy healthy the Holy Spirit not
[20:00] some C former theological theological
[20:02] SIM name Dogma but the Blessed Holy
[20:04] Spirit not the tree of knowledge but the
[20:05] Holy Spirit you see it's God's plan
[20:08] began to woo over you and make love to
[20:10] me and I accepted him now I accepted New
[20:13] Birth all right and then he came down
[20:15] into my heart and took his place that's
[20:17] what he wanted to start with right
[20:20] that's what he wanted to start with amen
[20:21] so God brings his plan right back to
[20:23] where it's supposed to be now we know he
[20:25] cursed this thing and didn't take the
[20:28] curse off right all right right actually
[20:31] the sin curse is not over until what
[20:35] totally until somebody lives a thousand
[20:37] years right in the Millennium okay but
[20:40] now we know it to us it's different we
[20:42] come before the Earth right all right so
[20:44] don't get don't you know don't bother me
[20:46] on that one I know we come this thing
[20:49] becomes Eternal before we leave here but
[20:51] I'm talking about everything until that
[20:53] future home hits its ground and Satan is
[20:55] totally destroyed that dude is still
[20:58] there he's trying his best to beat us
[21:01] but until the future home comes cuz he's
[21:03] going to be loose a little season there
[21:04] at the end of the Millennium like we
[21:05] talked about in the Bible study he's
[21:07] going to be Loos a little season to do
[21:09] what I don't know but there's one thing
[21:11] for sure you and I if we're bride we're
[21:13] going to be an eternal body right he
[21:16] could he could throw a a nuclear bomb
[21:18] down our throat and it's not going to
[21:19] bother us so don't worry about it don't
[21:22] worry about what's going to happen or
[21:24] what's going to take place just remember
[21:26] one thing if you're born again today
[21:28] free ride to glory amen all right all
[21:31] right let's go to number
[21:32] two wisdom versus Faith he said but
[21:35] listen my dear you love the little thing
[21:36] now this is Satan coming to eat see
[21:39] surely God Made You for a
[21:41] purpose and he
[21:43] did s's not lying
[21:46] amen you know that's right see you're a
[21:49] woman see he can show them the
[21:51] animals yeah you were made for this
[21:54] purpose you're a woman that's what it is
[21:57] you don't know it now but you were made
[21:59] for this purpose right oh you're a
[22:01] lovely little thing dear uhhuh look at
[22:03] those dainty little hands see why sure
[22:05] you will
[22:07] surely and he said but oh you you think
[22:10] that a good loving father God would do a
[22:12] thing like that no she said well if we
[22:13] do we'll die yeah what' she do she
[22:15] listened to reason took wisdom that's a
[22:18] tree Delight for one to be desired of
[22:20] and she fell for it now look at what
[22:22] underline now you see the seed that she
[22:24] was holding would have finally become a
[22:26] mother by the will of God through a
[22:28] spoken word amen she would have become
[22:30] our
[22:32] mother she would have finally become a
[22:35] mother but she couldn't wait and went
[22:37] into that and then what happened in the
[22:38] garden remember last Sunday that stopped
[22:41] her ability to bring me and you forth
[22:43] cuz her womb was polluted then and God
[22:45] had to do what he did and he did and
[22:47] we're here the way we are we can say
[22:49] what if if we want to but this is the
[22:51] way it happened right and this is the
[22:52] way God wanted to happen cuz God sitting
[22:55] there with all those attributes ready to
[22:56] be displayed and no way to display them
[22:59] right he had to let this happen all
[23:00] right now number
[23:02] three spoken words Original Seed now
[23:04] notice what happened to Eve's children
[23:06] the first one that was born now if God
[23:08] said multiply to his bride to Adam's
[23:11] bride and replenish multiply and
[23:12] replenish the Earth that was God's
[23:14] commission right and she would have done
[23:17] it and he would mixing themselves
[23:19] together by but what happened when Adam
[23:22] got ready to come to her she was already
[23:23] a mother right see what I mean same
[23:26] thing was Christ Church
[23:28] look at 79 when God give a commission
[23:31] which cannot perish God's word's Eternal
[23:33] in other words he said multiply and
[23:34] replenish the Earth right it cannot fail
[23:37] when he said multiply and replenish the
[23:38] Earth that was God's Eternal
[23:40] purpose you see that word Eternal
[23:43] purpose that was his eternal purpose to
[23:45] carry that out you cannot die because
[23:48] it's his word you have to live if that
[23:51] child had been brought forth right there
[23:53] had been no death but she couldn't wait
[23:56] right amen all right now look this
[23:58] this
[24:01] next now God's purpose for husband and
[24:04] wife to bring forth children we see that
[24:05] right I mean we' say well well we know
[24:08] that brother Wade well you know what I
[24:11] just want to make sure that the you knew
[24:13] the prophet knew that yeah and now you
[24:15] know it by his by the Bible and by the
[24:17] word of God we were supposed to be a
[24:19] family this is not just something that
[24:21] happened because God had to redo another
[24:23] plan exactly no we're going to read a
[24:26] little while in Christ mystery God
[24:27] revealed it brother Brown said this is
[24:28] his plan and his purpose amen this right
[24:31] here right this is exactly God purpos
[24:34] for husband and wife to bring forth
[24:35] children he was establishing the family
[24:38] cuz he told them to be fruitful multiply
[24:41] and replenisher so that they were what
[24:42] multiplying theel making a family unit
[24:45] amen the family is God's intended
[24:47] results of the marriage relationship
[24:49] that he established in Eden thank you
[24:51] Lord that's what the family is it's
[24:53] God's intended result of the marriage
[24:56] relationship that he established in Eden
[24:58] now let's go to number
[25:01] four but in Genesis 2 when he made man
[25:04] he said I am y a h u j u v u
[25:08] h Yahoo
[25:10] Jehovah what did it mean I am the all
[25:13] existing one who has created something
[25:16] off of myself right which is what
[25:19] Genesis
[25:20] 1 Adam put that in Adam
[25:23] right A Part something off of myself to
[25:26] be a son of mine
[25:28] yeah see Adam was a Son of God there was
[25:30] a family already right all right but
[25:32] Adam couldn't reproduce himself God was
[25:35] finished creating so he had to take a
[25:37] piece of Adam bring her woman or or Adam
[25:42] made flesh in another form right or a
[25:45] temporary or an amateur little one of
[25:48] mine Oh Glory why he gave man Jehovah
[25:50] means that he gave man to be an amateur
[25:52] God because he is Father God and he made
[25:55] a man an amateur God right so he isn't
[25:58] self-existing anymore right excuse me he
[26:01] exists with his family amen Ella Ella
[26:04] Elohim now he is Jehovah Jehovah meaning
[26:07] the one who exists with his family so
[26:10] he's not going to lose
[26:12] that he's going to he's Jehovah he's
[26:14] Jehovah God all right now let's read
[26:17] down at the blue let's now God was made
[26:20] to be predominant over all the Earth he
[26:22] had dominion and the Earth was man's
[26:23] Dominion see there is that scripture
[26:25] that if that his domain he was God over
[26:28] the Earth he could speak and it would be
[26:29] so he could speak this and it would be
[26:30] so there he is god Jehovah the one who
[26:33] once existed in
[26:35] self-existence but now exists with his
[26:38] family and his little ones with him
[26:39] there you are there's no way to bring
[26:40] that back right see there's no way once
[26:43] I started having children that I it
[26:45] wouldn't be a family unit you say well
[26:47] they died off if they died if Josh and
[26:49] Hannah died I'm still a father I had
[26:53] children right God the same way he's
[26:56] going to always have children amen all
[26:58] right all right now let's go to the next
[27:00] one number five oness any man in his
[27:04] family a correct good Noble obedient
[27:07] family is one with another any family
[27:10] and if there's something in the family
[27:11] that moves them apart then it's not
[27:13] right the family's broken somewhere they
[27:16] should all be one father with Mother
[27:18] Mother with father children with parent
[27:21] parent with children all in agreement
[27:23] and when you see that you'll see a
[27:24] lovely picture that's God's purpose you
[27:28] say boy my family is not that way well
[27:30] you know what mine's not either but I
[27:33] trust God enough to know that it will be
[27:36] in his time not my time everybody wants
[27:39] everything to be perfect right
[27:42] now but remember if it's God's purpose
[27:46] it'll happen right right that's God's
[27:49] purpose and his purpose as father
[27:51] Supreme was to be one with his family
[27:54] look Earthly family Adam
[27:58] and the only way they could be one with
[28:00] a family or with God was because God's
[28:02] nature was in
[28:06] them you both got to have the nature of
[28:08] God and have a real family all right
[28:10] amen that's what brother Brown saying
[28:12] which because God's nature was in them
[28:15] and so that made them with God's nature
[28:18] in them then with each other in God they
[28:20] became all one isn't that a beautiful
[28:22] picture God and his family father over
[28:25] all Supreme no death no sorrow no heart
[28:27] heartache no nothing just joy
[28:29] unspeakable never to be sick never to
[28:31] have a heartache just one with God what
[28:33] a picture because the very in nature of
[28:36] God was in these people and therefore
[28:38] what they did they followed just in line
[28:41] with God and God with them made them one
[28:44] now see that stopped when that happened
[28:47] in the garden that stopped to be
[28:50] fulfilled that wasn't fulfilled but it's
[28:52] being fulfilled now Glory God's coming
[28:54] right back into a group of people to
[28:56] fulfill every bit of that right right no
[28:58] death no sorrow no heart heartache no
[29:00] nothing never to be sick never have a
[29:01] headache what that's where we're going
[29:03] right amen that's where we're going to
[29:05] that's our that's our body that's our
[29:06] glorified body that's what we're going
[29:08] to but they had it in the Garden of
[29:12] Eden that's why I've always said this
[29:14] body I was thinking about it the other
[29:16] day um we were um went look at some
[29:20] hunting land and you know I had briers
[29:21] and all kind of stuff and I found them
[29:23] sticking all in me and Dad had some in
[29:24] him and found a tick on me too so be
[29:26] careful but you know this this body all
[29:30] the functions during that day I didn't
[29:31] have to stop and say feet move arm
[29:34] move breathe breathe breathe breathe
[29:40] heartbeat heartbeat no it just happened
[29:43] natural he's talking about when Adam and
[29:45] Eve were in the garden before the fall
[29:48] they were in a perfect condition right
[29:50] that they were not they were not in a
[29:52] fallen condition they were not eating
[29:54] food and doing the waste business you
[29:58] got it you understand what I'm saying
[29:59] they were perfect cuz their body
[30:01] absorbed their the nutrients and there
[30:03] was nothing left over that's our problem
[30:05] now we got so much perverted food got a
[30:07] lot of stuff left over but we're going
[30:09] back to where we can eat and do the same
[30:11] thing so see it just this just stopped a
[30:13] little bit of time in here like I said
[30:15] remember last Sunday this just broke a
[30:17] little bit of Eternity into time for us
[30:19] to do what reflect Our Father amen
[30:24] reflect our father that's what we're
[30:25] here to do right we're to reflect the
[30:27] family that we came from we're going to
[30:29] talk about it this afternoon where
[30:31] brother Brown said if you're searching
[30:33] for a wife look at her family
[30:37] right you know somebody told me one time
[30:39] said if you want to look at your look at
[30:41] your mother-in-law and look at your wife
[30:43] but you look at your mother-in-law and
[30:44] that's what your your wife's going to
[30:45] look like when she gets that age yeah
[30:50] so thank about it I'll read it where
[30:53] brother Bandon will tell you he'll say
[30:55] check out the family not just the girl
[30:57] check out the
[30:58] family nothing wrong with that checking
[31:01] out the family but God told us let's get
[31:04] back to him God told us to multiply and
[31:07] if we do we got to have mother-in-law so
[31:08] praise God for
[31:10] it right amen am we got to have them
[31:15] praise God we don't have to have a
[31:17] thousand of them like problem
[31:19] did all right let's go to let's go to
[31:21] the uh number
[31:24] six now listen God told to multiply and
[31:27] replenish the
[31:30] Earth he didn't want to
[31:33] just have a bunch of people and not be
[31:36] able to communicate with them a family
[31:39] unit is someone is a part of your family
[31:41] that you ought to be able to
[31:43] communicate above anything else you
[31:45] ought to be able to communicate with
[31:47] your with your parents you ought to be
[31:48] able to communicate with your children I
[31:51] know that's hard sometimes but that's
[31:53] not that's what God wanted he wanted
[31:54] Fellowship right and fellowship is just
[31:56] not one way
[31:57] fellowships both ways all right them
[32:00] fellowshipping with you and you
[32:02] fellowshipping with them now look his
[32:04] heart is greater for Fellowship than
[32:06] ours are and the reason he makes us that
[32:09] way is because we're offspring of his
[32:12] that's what makes us long for Fellowship
[32:15] long to to get together with our family
[32:18] that's what makes a mother would die for
[32:20] her baby why that's what makes a father
[32:22] would give his life for his wife a
[32:24] husband a true husband would give his
[32:25] life for his wife why because Christ
[32:28] give his life for the church there's
[32:29] your tipe his wife it's a strain in you
[32:32] listen to this it's a strain in
[32:35] you it's something woven into your very
[32:38] being right right and it made a mother
[32:41] Dash to a burning fire not thinking
[32:43] about her own self and her hair on fire
[32:44] and her clothes on fire to grab her baby
[32:47] and run out with why it's love of a
[32:50] parent and God is the first and Original
[32:53] Parent amen so he ought to know how to
[32:55] raise a family if he's the first in the
[32:57] original and he's Eternal he ought to
[33:00] know how to raise a family what we got
[33:01] to do is we just got to listen right and
[33:04] there's where that strain comes from
[33:06] what God Amen even in Natural Life the
[33:10] strain of family comes that a husband
[33:12] will give his life for his wife whether
[33:13] he's a Christian or not all right and
[33:15] there's where the strain comes through
[33:17] because the woman gave birth to the
[33:19] child so it goes down through the
[33:21] generations that's what he's saying all
[33:22] right let's go to the next one number
[33:25] seven and I think it's when we can get
[33:28] together with this type of Fellowship it
[33:30] does something to us that draws us
[33:32] closer to each other and as we get
[33:35] closer to each other we get closer to
[33:37] God right can I read that again and when
[33:41] we get closer to each other we get
[33:43] closer to God or Jesus said in so much
[33:46] as you have done to the least of these
[33:48] my little ones you have done it to me
[33:50] amen I've got a little boy in here
[33:52] somewhere I suppose Joseph I got Billy
[33:53] sitting here two daughters sitting back
[33:55] there and a wife now if any body had
[33:57] something that was you wanted to do real
[33:59] nice I would much rather you do it to my
[34:01] children than for me now that would be
[34:04] everybody's life amen all right I would
[34:06] do it do it to my to my children give it
[34:08] to my children than it would me see and
[34:10] I feel maybe as a parent and he's the
[34:13] source of Parenthood I think that that's
[34:16] the way God
[34:18] feels if we we should if we should we
[34:21] serve him as we serve each other that's
[34:24] how we serve God all right now think
[34:26] about that you know we're talking about
[34:28] natural family we're going to get into a
[34:29] few details here in a little bit but
[34:32] also remember in the back of your mind
[34:33] how we treat our spiritual family right
[34:36] our spiritual family like brother Donnie
[34:37] and I were talking yesterday he went
[34:39] down to see his family the other
[34:40] Saturday and he just felt like he was
[34:42] not part of them right that's right he
[34:46] was out of place yeah in his natural
[34:48] family cuz there was no what there was
[34:50] no Fellowship that's you can't be
[34:53] unequally Yol and have Fellowship right
[34:57] you can't do that I'm sorry and you said
[34:59] well but now look Jesus said if you
[35:01] can't forsake father mother sister
[35:03] brother children he said you can't enter
[35:06] the kingdom you got to forsake them you
[35:08] can't do it go you don't have to be mean
[35:09] to them you don't have to do away with
[35:11] them no they're there right they're
[35:13] they're they're there you cannot just
[35:15] say God wipe them off no that's where
[35:17] you come from that's your natural family
[35:19] you just better thank God that if your
[35:21] natural family is born again and you can
[35:23] fellowship with them be just you just
[35:25] ought to feel like you Amen on top of
[35:27] the world because it's it would be hard
[35:31] and I can't I can't say that because all
[35:33] of my family is serving the lord and we
[35:35] Fellowship together but I would it'd be
[35:38] something in my mind I couldn't realize
[35:41] for me to be the only person in my whole
[35:43] family to serve the Lord right I had be
[35:46] lonely amen right yeah I guess you just
[35:49] have to fellowship with God the best you
[35:50] could and and just keep praying because
[35:52] God you know what God said he'd give you
[35:54] the desires of your heart
[35:57] he give you some family he'll give you
[36:00] family don't you worry about it right
[36:02] let's go to number
[36:03] eight now God here it is Christ The
[36:05] Mystery of God revealed now look this is
[36:07] some great we we quote this and this
[36:09] some mysterious do you know what he's
[36:11] talking about a plan and a
[36:14] family plan and a family that's what
[36:16] he's talking about right now God's
[36:18] secret
[36:19] mystery he had before the world began
[36:22] now back in the back part of God's mind
[36:24] there was something that he was trying
[36:26] and going going to achieve and he had a
[36:29] motive in doing it
[36:31] right remember always check your motive
[36:33] and objective right his motive and
[36:35] objective to in order to let him to be
[36:38] expressed was to let us out let me
[36:41] finish the let me I'm not misquoting
[36:43] brother brandham but I'm telling you
[36:45] that's what he's saying in order to let
[36:46] himself be expressed he had to have a
[36:48] motive to do it he had to have a p a n
[36:52] right he had a
[36:54] plan but he exactly wasn't God at that
[36:57] time let's go back up let's read it the
[36:59] way he read I don't want to misquote the
[37:01] prophet he was trying and was going to
[37:03] achieve and had a motive in doing it in
[37:05] order to let him be himself be expressed
[37:09] because first there wasn't even a moon a
[37:10] star atom molecule or anything he was
[37:13] God but he exactly wasn't God at that
[37:15] time cuz God is an object of worship
[37:17] there wasn't nothing to worship him so
[37:19] in his great mind he wanted these
[37:22] attributes to be expressed and in him
[37:24] was love and him was to be first thing
[37:26] what father right he wanted a family
[37:30] amen and him wants to be Son part of the
[37:33] family glory and him wants to be savior
[37:35] of the family and him Wants To Be A
[37:37] Healer of the family and in all these
[37:40] great attributes that we see already
[37:42] expressed they were look and all these
[37:44] great attributes that we see already
[37:48] expressed right they were in God this is
[37:51] the expression of God's mind amen right
[37:54] here that's right in this Fallen
[37:56] condition and what whatever you want to
[37:57] say God had God had no different thought
[38:00] than when he had that one in his mind to
[38:02] right now he's not one Split Second
[38:05] older either right that's why I've
[38:08] always said did he did he sit here and
[38:10] think of this and then it happened that
[38:12] make him be time right he thought of
[38:15] this and it happens yeah we're part of
[38:17] God's mind we're actually walking in
[38:20] God's mind if you'll believe that we're
[38:22] walking in the very Mind Of God cuz he
[38:24] can't see see we sat down
[38:27] see uh we sit down and U make a plan and
[38:32] then we go execute it now God's
[38:34] Eternal he can't sit down and make a
[38:37] plan and then execute it as he's making
[38:39] a plan it's being
[38:41] executed cuz he's not one second older
[38:44] he's not waiting on yeah he's waiting on
[38:46] me and you sure down here in time but in
[38:48] eternity this thing's already done am
[38:50] it's already done I telling brother
[38:52] Donnie we got to
[38:53] realize that Holy Ghost Inside of us is
[38:56] in another Dimension amen that's right
[38:58] it's not in this Dimension right the
[39:00] Holy Ghost you have Come From Another
[39:02] Dimension that's right into you put this
[39:05] what you prove it preacher we're sitting
[39:08] together in
[39:09] what Heavenly places in Christ this new
[39:12] birth that we have is in another
[39:14] dimension than what this outside guy's
[39:16] in right amen that's why it's hard for
[39:19] us to contact that guy he's in another
[39:21] dimension right but every once in a
[39:24] while remember the filters
[39:27] that's our problem it's not the Holy
[39:29] Ghost is our problem we're our problem
[39:31] the the flu amen what do you do when you
[39:34] unstop something you turn around blow it
[39:37] out right right it's flowing in this
[39:39] direction you turn around and they call
[39:40] it a back flow you back flow it back out
[39:43] what you let this that comes piled in
[39:45] this way Brother Richard you let this
[39:47] push it out that way that's right you
[39:50] let you let it push it back out let this
[39:52] push it out all right don't keep packing
[39:54] it in let him push it out and let him
[39:55] live amen but remember that you are
[39:58] truly living in two Dimension amen the
[40:02] Holy Ghost you have never lied never
[40:04] cheated never stole never went to
[40:05] Walmart amen never had to go to
[40:09] Walmart he hates to go Walmart he hates
[40:12] for you to go to Walmart but remember
[40:15] that man inside of us is eternal he's
[40:17] almighty God he's that Genesis 1:26 this
[40:20] is the family of God we're in another
[40:23] dimension but we're in but brother
[40:24] Brandon like he said he put us all these
[40:26] attributes had to come into this
[40:28] dimension for us to do what reflect the
[40:31] image of God cuz we are born in in this
[40:34] is the image of God in the image of God
[40:36] that's why I love Genesis 126 cuz it's
[40:38] the whole Bible it's a whole Bible it's
[40:41] all of God's plan in two or three little
[40:44] verses there's everything God wanted
[40:46] Glory he wanted family he wanted us or
[40:49] he wanted us to create us want to
[40:51] multiply and replenish the
[40:53] Earth and us live and subdue the Earth
[40:56] right be a king on the earth be a god of
[40:58] the earth that's what he wanted all
[41:00] right all in Genesis right there right
[41:03] and that Genesis 126 just dropped over
[41:05] it's called Christ right he was born
[41:07] Lord Lord the Christ that's what he come
[41:09] with he come with that in him all right
[41:14] that's why a can say the son of man
[41:17] which is in heaven he was standing on
[41:18] earth right this was in another
[41:20] dimension amen his soul was in another
[41:22] dimension right PL could do things but
[41:25] see he didn't have the flu stopped up
[41:27] like you and I do he wasn't born in sin
[41:29] he didn't have to go over there and ask
[41:32] forgiveness he was the forgiver amen cuz
[41:36] he had the mind of God he didn't have a
[41:37] strain of humanity like you and I now he
[41:41] did have a strain of humanity but not
[41:42] like me and you he didn't have an
[41:44] Earthly father to look back to he didn't
[41:46] have an Earthly mother to look back to
[41:48] remember his father was always he said
[41:50] his father which is in heaven amen
[41:52] Hallowed be thy name all right number
[41:55] nine see this is so hard to stay natural
[41:58] because you the family of God is just
[42:00] interwoven in us so much in the
[42:02] spiritual form all right but we got to
[42:04] keep it natural because we got to use
[42:07] like I said before this holy ghost that
[42:09] we do have we only use it a little bit
[42:11] of a
[42:13] time we only use it a little bit of the
[42:15] time right let's don't think we're so
[42:17] super spiritual that we can't live that
[42:18] we don't live on this Earth in common as
[42:20] common people we do we do we we live a
[42:23] lot more in the natural than we do in
[42:24] the Supernatural all right
[42:26] but I was reading this morning where
[42:29] brother Rand said he said it's going to
[42:30] take I reading about persecution he said
[42:33] it's going to take persecution to turn
[42:36] us what to turn us back too right yes
[42:40] realizing that we are Eternal people
[42:43] trapped in a trapped in a in a flesh
[42:45] body or in a in a not Eternal Body all
[42:49] right when we do that though that's
[42:50] going to let that Outside Inside Man
[42:53] come out right we just let him out every
[42:56] once in a while that's not good but that
[42:58] God knew that he's not having a crisis
[43:01] meeting when we all get in trouble
[43:02] sometimes and we don't talk to him every
[43:04] day he knew that was going to happen
[43:06] right sometimes he just kind of TAPS you
[43:08] on the head and say hey I'm here right
[43:11] so God knew that we would be
[43:14] here but then he put us in flesh so we
[43:18] could be contacted amen see Satan
[43:21] thought he could cut that off at the
[43:23] Garden of Eden so God couldn't contact
[43:25] man he said hey don't worry about
[43:29] it I got
[43:31] blood I'm going to kill the lamb and
[43:34] then I'm going to die I'm going to take
[43:36] care of this Satan don't you worry about
[43:37] it all right but he put us in flesh so
[43:40] we could be contacted in order he could
[43:43] contact he became one of us when he
[43:45] became Jesus Christ the son of God
[43:47] himself the fullness of the
[43:49] manifestation of God see that was the
[43:50] fullness of the manifestation of God
[43:52] that's what God wanted to live in human
[43:54] flesh to be with his people but what a
[43:59] great problem that Jesus had on Earth
[44:02] his family was inside of
[44:05] him not expressed yet right that's why
[44:08] he had to go to Calvary to get us out
[44:10] Glory just like this right here look
[44:12] when I was in my father I knew nothing
[44:15] about it you didn't know you were in
[44:17] your daddy and your great-grandfather
[44:19] there was no place you you saw yourself
[44:21] moving and you know no forget it
[44:23] people until I was 5 or six years old I
[44:26] didn't know
[44:27] nothing it's getting
[44:30] worse when I was when I was in my father
[44:33] I knew nothing about it yeah but when I
[44:37] became his son and was born of him I was
[44:40] an attribute a part of my father right
[44:43] and you're a part of your father he's
[44:45] talking about natural now he's saying
[44:47] and as children of God we are part of
[44:49] God's attribute that was in him made
[44:53] flesh like he was made flesh so we can
[44:56] have Fellowship one with the
[44:58] other huh as a family of God upon where
[45:03] the Earth
[45:05] right and that was God's purpose at the
[45:09] beginning yes sir that's what God wanted
[45:12] at the beginning excuse me he had
[45:14] everything under control and he turned
[45:16] man over into the Garden on free moral
[45:19] agency and said son it's
[45:21] yours what a beautiful place that's what
[45:24] he done he turned it right over over to
[45:26] us and said here right but this family
[45:29] unit is not we we come here on the earth
[45:32] and we we live and we have children and
[45:35] and we grow up and our parents pass away
[45:37] and a lot of your parents are are gone
[45:39] on to be with the Lord and and that's
[45:41] good because they're in a better place
[45:45] than you are oh yeah if they're born
[45:47] again child of God so don't worry about
[45:51] them let's worry about us now remember
[45:52] what David did this is a wonderful thing
[45:55] in the scripture where David mourn for
[45:58] his child remember the first child that
[46:00] was born between him and B Sheba God
[46:01] said that baby's not going to
[46:03] live but David was so mourned for that
[46:06] child he sackcloth and Ashes and and
[46:09] wouldn't eat and fasted and laid out and
[46:11] prayed and all those things but when the
[46:13] men came and told him said Your son's
[46:16] dead the Bible said he immediately gets
[46:18] up goes in takes a shower let's put it
[46:20] up in
[46:21] 2000 uh 12 words he comes in takes a
[46:24] shower put his clothes on sits down
[46:27] starts eating and the men are scratching
[46:29] their head looking around you know his
[46:31] kind of his little scribes you know and
[46:32] they walk in and they say
[46:34] David you were mourning before
[46:37] and seems like nothing's happened in
[46:39] other words David's great words he said
[46:42] there's nothing I can do about it now
[46:45] the only thing I can do is make sure I
[46:48] right go where he
[46:51] is Sir just make sure I if you got
[46:55] family that's this passed on to be with
[46:56] the Lord or or or friends or anything
[46:59] that are that are born again just say
[47:01] look God I want to see them again I want
[47:05] to see them again my purpose is to see
[47:07] that person again in the like was when
[47:11] right when they got ready to close the
[47:12] casket on brother Tom I said Donnie that
[47:14] will'll never see that man right there
[47:16] again that's
[47:18] right that man like this and walking on
[47:22] a can coming through the door we'll
[47:24] never see that man again right right
[47:26] will see him in the prime of his life
[47:29] and the that ought to just that to me if
[47:31] there's nothing else God does for me
[47:34] nothing else God does for me if my
[47:35] parents pass on and I know they're born
[47:37] again parents and I get to see them
[47:38] young kids cuz see I never got to see
[47:40] them as young kids you didn't either you
[47:43] can't unless you were born when your mom
[47:45] and dad was
[47:46] 12 you can't remember him being young
[47:49] they always been
[47:50] old whole bunch of people my kids I mean
[47:54] my parents have been old
[47:56] but we're going to see them young just
[47:58] like us that's my goal I hate to see an
[48:02] old
[48:04] person hurting bent over just the Pains
[48:09] of Life what a relief what a relief with
[48:13] brother Tommy was just hurting all over
[48:16] but it's gone now that's that will never
[48:19] come
[48:21] back that is a consolation that'll never
[48:25] come back
[48:26] that'll never come back that way that'll
[48:28] come back the way it should have been
[48:29] through Adam and Eve had they not been a
[48:31] there's what God's purpose is as
[48:33] children of God we are part of God's
[48:34] attribute that was in him made flesh
[48:37] like he was made flesh so we can have
[48:40] Fellowship one with the other as a
[48:42] family of God upon the
[48:44] Earth and that was God's purpose at the
[48:47] beginning yes sir that's what God wanted
[48:49] to beginning and we think we got
[48:51] problems but listen to this next quote
[48:53] Yeah number 10
[48:57] Mother's
[48:59] Day then we shall see him then we shall
[49:02] be like him then we shall worship him
[49:06] then we shall see
[49:08] mother as God wants her
[49:13] amen mother would not be complete there
[49:17] without her family
[49:19] amen cuz the greatest time of all her
[49:22] life is to see the children around the
[49:24] table right all of them healthy and
[49:26] happy amen and to see her pour the
[49:28] coffee or whatever she does and fixes
[49:31] supper and her and Dad sit down well
[49:33] that's the happiest time in Mama's life
[49:36] see her kitties all all at home now this
[49:39] this is part of the quote is the quote I
[49:41] want you to see but don't miss don't be
[49:43] missing that day
[49:45] right that let the great chain of your
[49:48] family be hooked together link by link
[49:52] let every spoke be in the wheel and then
[49:55] when we sit down with our families and
[49:57] groups across the canopies of
[50:02] Eternity what a day that will be then
[50:05] we'll
[50:06] understand across the canopies of
[50:09] Eternity amen like number
[50:12] 11 I think of something how mothers will
[50:14] refuse to raise children bring up
[50:16] children and young women practice birth
[50:18] control buy a little dog and lead them
[50:20] around and you only realize lady that
[50:22] just about 20 years of your life that
[50:24] you have that God's lotted to you that
[50:26] you're going to be able to do this great
[50:28] Duty for God
[50:30] yeah yeah now we're going to talk a few
[50:33] minutes on birth control but just hang
[50:34] on a minute do you know your child might
[50:37] be a modern fny or something like that
[50:40] do you realize just about 20 years of
[50:42] your life is as long as you'll be able
[50:44] to raise children and all through the
[50:47] the
[50:48] eternities I love that
[50:52] word Brother Gary that's strike that's a
[50:54] bell that you say eternity eternity that
[50:57] strikes a bell in my heart that strikes
[50:59] something in my heart because God's the
[51:02] only one that's Eternal so if you're
[51:03] hooked into that that makes you Eternal
[51:06] and through the eternities you'll enjoy
[51:08] the blessings of God if you bring a
[51:10] child in this world and raise it right
[51:13] that star that shining Yonder in glory
[51:15] you will be associated with it sisters
[51:18] you don't think you're very important do
[51:19] you see and then to refuse to raise the
[51:22] little fellas because you'd rather take
[51:23] your running around and carrying on
[51:25] that's ridiculous you shouldn't do that
[51:27] and now don't do it no sir don't you do
[51:29] it be a happy person amen mothers of old
[51:32] they love to raise children but all this
[51:34] modern American day that we're living in
[51:36] I tell you our nation is simply polluted
[51:39] there's not a hope left to this nation
[51:41] as I see only an oldfashioned Revival
[51:43] and according to the scripture it'll
[51:45] never be
[51:46] Nationwide so it's not going to be a
[51:48] nationwide Revival but all through
[51:50] eternities you'll enjoy the blessings of
[51:52] God glory now I don't know if it's this
[51:54] quote of the next one scroll on down is
[51:56] that that all that one brother
[51:58] Anderson must be yeah that's okay
[52:02] because somewhere in here brother R
[52:03] speaks of you remember the uh John and
[52:06] Charles Wesley's mother yeah Sarah I
[52:08] think her name is Sarah Wesley she had
[52:10] 17 kids right she sat down every day for
[52:14] 2 hours brother BR said she didn't have
[52:16] a washing machine she didn't have an
[52:18] oven like we do she didn't have microwav
[52:21] let's get on up here in end time she
[52:23] didn't have delivery service
[52:26] she took 17 kids in a
[52:28] Charles Wesley wrote some of the
[52:30] greatest amen hymns ever known to man
[52:34] right and John Wesley we know what he
[52:37] was he was a prophet to that age right
[52:40] he took millions of souls into eternity
[52:42] just because she sat down and read the
[52:44] Bible to
[52:45] them but look mothers of old they love
[52:48] to raise their children now let's just
[52:50] for a second let's go to the next
[52:53] one invisible Union
[52:56] speak of the day that when women
[52:57] wouldn't be no more wouldn't wouldn't no
[52:59] more want children they want a dog or a
[53:02] cat or something like that but she don't
[53:04] want children anymore why she is old
[53:07] mother hovered if she has a child see
[53:09] she don't want that's the remarks of
[53:12] Hollywood it don't want this woman to be
[53:15] an old mother hover so she'll he'll have
[53:17] some operation performed on himself or
[53:19] her one they'll keep them from having
[53:21] children they don't want no children
[53:24] Jesus spoke of it and what did he say at
[53:26] that time they'll begin to cry for the
[53:28] rocks and the mountains to fall on them
[53:30] she'll practice birth control so she can
[53:31] go to parties she can't be bothered with
[53:34] a baby nursing her it'll disform her
[53:36] when she's pregnated it'll be it'll
[53:37] disform her she won't look like she used
[53:39] to now what's brother Brown
[53:41] saying you were put here on Earth
[53:43] sisters to bring forth children now
[53:46] we're not going to talk about birth
[53:47] control that's up to you and your
[53:48] husband you talk to the husband if you
[53:50] have a situation you need to talk to
[53:52] there's the pastor on the front row I
[53:54] love it this time there's the pastor
[53:56] sitting right there you can talk to him
[53:57] but I'm going to tell you something
[53:58] you're never going to stop a baby to
[54:00] being born if God wants it to be born I
[54:02] don't care you can say well I don't
[54:03] practice I don't take a birth control
[54:05] pill I don't do this but we do this well
[54:08] that's birth
[54:09] control anything you do to control the
[54:11] birth is birth control right amen so
[54:14] just have fun yeah Jesus spoke of and he
[54:16] said when they are doing this at that
[54:18] time
[54:19] they'll oh I'm sorry she pra she'll
[54:21] practice birth control now look I think
[54:23] what brother brand saying he sees
[54:26] the attitude behind this I don't know I
[54:28] think in certain cases he might have
[54:29] said birth control was okay for hurting
[54:32] the woman or anything like that right
[54:34] all right but look at his look at what
[54:37] he's talking about a woman can take
[54:40] birth control now and go to a party and
[54:42] not have to worry about getting pregnant
[54:43] let's just be real cuz she can take
[54:45] birth control so she can go out and have
[54:47] fun with anybody she wants to oh yeah
[54:50] see but if if you if you practice birth
[54:53] control you don't have to worry about
[54:54] those things so she can go go to a party
[54:55] she can't be bothered with a baby
[54:56] nursing it'll deform her when she's
[54:58] pregnated it'll deform her she won't
[55:00] look like she used to and her husband
[55:02] ignorant enough to let her go that way
[55:04] she won't give him a Child Jesus spoke
[55:06] of and he said when they were doing this
[55:07] at that time they'll go to crying then
[55:10] for the rocks to fall on them it's the
[55:12] coming of the Lord so we see that in the
[55:13] end time with abortions and all that
[55:15] stuff they pay great sums of money for
[55:17] cats dogs to mother that's right she
[55:20] must mother something because it's a
[55:22] god-given nature to her and we see that
[55:24] happening all over the country and I'm
[55:26] not condemning any of you or saying what
[55:29] it's up to you and your husband that's
[55:31] what I believe I I I don't think we
[55:33] ought to get in your bedroom yeah but
[55:35] but I do think that brother Brandon is
[55:37] being clear about a woman is put here to
[55:39] have children right all right and to
[55:41] bring forth children now things you have
[55:43] to do if you're if you can't then then
[55:45] you know that's maybe you know God's
[55:48] give you something to do besides having
[55:50] children sisters he give you something
[55:52] to do in in uh in life
[55:55] than not to have children I I don't

[56:34] responsibility to raise your kids it's
[56:35] not my responsibility tell your son get
[56:37] a haircut it's not my responsibility to
[56:39] tell your daughter that she's wearing
[56:42] immoral clothes yeah you're the parent
[56:44] right it's not my fault it's
[56:48] yours so don't put it all on me well
[56:50] brother D Don't Preach on it you ought
[56:52] to preach on it at home right
[56:56] problem is the woman the mother looks
[56:58] like the daughter and the daughter looks
[56:59] like the other daughter brother Brown
[57:01] say you went from a flapper to
[57:03] prostitute right sorry that's what he
[57:05] said no that's not my word that's his
[57:08] all right preparing for children low
[57:09] children are inheritage of the Lord so
[57:12] they're not a burden children should not
[57:14] be a burden I just appreciate she's
[57:17] sitting right here on the front PE I
[57:19] appreciate sister mil and I told
[57:20] somebody I think brother D and I were
[57:22] talking about I appreciate sister Mila
[57:24] she's trying her best to raise his
[57:25] children she's not letting somebody else
[57:27] raise him right she's trying to raise
[57:28] his children Glory she's doing the right
[57:30] thing I and I not because yeah give her
[57:33] a hand because not sit on front a lot of
[57:35] you that have single single mothers or
[57:38] or single fathers I I admire somebody
[57:41] but the ones I don't admire is the ones
[57:43] that that go where's my
[57:46] kids where's my kids are they on the top
[57:49] of the
[57:50] church where's my kids yeah they're part
[57:54] of you
[57:55] not me they're part of you you go find
[57:58] out where they're
[58:00] at L children are Heritage of the Lord
[58:04] and the fruit of the womb see that'll
[58:06] show you what in the garden amen God
[58:08] said don't eat of the what
[58:11] fruit in the midst of the garden
[58:13] everybody understand what I'm talking
[58:14] about cuz you are the fruit of your
[58:17] mother you come from your mother and the
[58:20] fruit of the womb is his reward amen as
[58:23] arrows are in the hand of a mighty man
[58:26] so are children of the youth so children
[58:29] are as bad as sometimes we think they
[58:31] are yeah they're a Heritage of the Lord
[58:35] and they're actually your heritage all
[58:37] right Proverbs excuse me 17:6 children's
[58:41] children are the crown of old
[58:43] men
[58:45] grandkids yeah and the glory of children
[58:48] are their fathers right all right so
[58:51] what we're supposed to glorify Our
[58:52] Father amen and we should do things that
[58:54] did not make our Earthly father ashamed
[58:56] of us right right if we do that then we
[58:59] got a problem all right let's go to Joel
[59:04] one this is
[59:06] important cuz remember visited iniquity
[59:09] was passed down through the generation
[59:11] right but do you remember the quote I
[59:12] gave you the other day a few weeks ago
[59:14] where brother brand said the reason God
[59:17] gave Abraham the commission was that he
[59:20] knew Abraham was going to tell it to his
[59:22] children and then tell it to his
[59:24] children and tell it to his right all
[59:27] right so right here is Joel 1:3 tell
[59:29] your children of it and let your
[59:31] children tell them their children what
[59:34] testimony right and your children tell
[59:37] their children and their children
[59:39] another generation going down through
[59:41] time you got to pass things on remember
[59:45] we've only begun in probably the what
[59:47] the 1500s maybe who's a history major um
[59:51] Janet I know you you studied history a
[59:53] lot 1500s they created a printing press
[59:55] or somewhere in there so from 1500 to
[59:58] 2012 we've only had written words down
[1:00:01] copies so people can read where did it
[1:00:03] come from God told him in Deuteronomy
[1:00:06] we'll read it in a little bit
[1:00:08] Deuteronomy 6 6-9 we'll read it in just
[1:00:10] a minute he told them to write it down
[1:00:13] and recite it to their children right so
[1:00:16] that they wouldn't forget it cuz you had
[1:00:18] to remember you had to remember what
[1:00:20] went on you couldn't you couldn't there
[1:00:21] was even this kind of book I'm holding
[1:00:23] in my hand you couldn't write it down
[1:00:25] where it was written on the tabl of the
[1:00:27] kid's heart all right now let's go to
[1:00:29] Matthew
[1:00:31] 18 and said verily I say unto you except
[1:00:34] you be converted and become as a little
[1:00:37] child you shall not enter into the
[1:00:39] Kingdom of Heaven who so therefore shall
[1:00:41] humble himself as this little child the
[1:00:44] same is greatest in the kingdom of
[1:00:46] heaven and who so shall receive one
[1:00:49] listen who so shall receive one such
[1:00:51] little child in my name receiveth me all
[1:00:54] right so you
[1:00:56] receive I know sometimes we got kids
[1:00:59] that that we don't think but that they
[1:01:04] should be doing this but a child really
[1:01:07] should carry on the family name that's
[1:01:09] what that is exactly that's what Jesus
[1:01:11] is telling them spiritually but he's
[1:01:13] also making a natural point that
[1:01:15] whosoever shall receive one child in my
[1:01:16] name receives
[1:01:17] me okay the glory of the father down to
[1:01:21] the children like we read before all
[1:01:23] right now let's go to Ephesians
[1:01:26] 6 here's where we're going to talk a few
[1:01:29] minutes about raising
[1:01:32] children and then we will start this
[1:01:35] afternoon on preparing for a
[1:01:40] spouse right and you fathers provoke not
[1:01:43] your children to wrath but bring them up
[1:01:46] in the nurture and admonition of the
[1:01:49] Lord have you ever looked that word up
[1:01:51] nurture the word nurture I wrote up here
[1:01:54] for you means to cultivate
[1:01:58] yeah when we cultivate a crop we are
[1:02:02] constantly doing what needs to be done
[1:02:03] to see that that crop reaches maturity
[1:02:06] you know what we're doing with our kids
[1:02:07] our kids are our crop right reaches M
[1:02:10] maturity and not just reach
[1:02:13] maturity but produces what it should
[1:02:16] right it requires constant awareness of
[1:02:19] what's happening to the
[1:02:21] crop dad planted a crop not too long ago
[1:02:25] now he's not going to take a 3mon
[1:02:27] vacation and come back and and and and
[1:02:30] everything's going to be in Rose there's
[1:02:32] not going to be any weeds bugs are not
[1:02:34] going to be eating anything he's going
[1:02:36] to have just wonderful fruit in about 3
[1:02:39] months I don't think
[1:02:41] so I don't think so he'd be he'd be
[1:02:44] happy to have anything besides weed and
[1:02:48] bugs no what do you do it requires
[1:02:50] constant awareness of what's happening
[1:02:51] to the
[1:02:52] crop no rain plenty of
[1:02:55] rain bugs no bugs it requires that one
[1:02:59] doing the
[1:03:00] cultivating not the neighbor if the if
[1:03:03] you plant a garden you don't depend on
[1:03:05] your neighbor to raise your garden right
[1:03:07] same way with your children and it
[1:03:09] requires that the one doing the
[1:03:11] cultivating is involved daily with that
[1:03:14] crop amen the crop must have the right
[1:03:17] environment soil water Etc you see what
[1:03:19] we're doing in the natural also pulling
[1:03:21] of the
[1:03:22] weeds and getting rid of the bugs that
[1:03:25] could harm the crop right so what does
[1:03:27] nurture he's talk he says to nurture now
[1:03:30] look here's what I had to say about it
[1:03:32] right here turn to the next one go to
[1:03:35] home is where we nurture our children
[1:03:37] yeah you say oh no no no we didn't bring
[1:03:40] to hang on a minute I'll let the prophet
[1:03:42] tell
[1:03:44] you brother the scriptures all here
[1:03:47] let's just obey it that's all as many as
[1:03:48] I love I rebuke that's this age right so
[1:03:52] then the Bible said also in Hebrews the
[1:03:54] 12
[1:03:54] 8 verse if they cannot stand and won't
[1:03:57] take rebuking they're illegitimate not
[1:03:58] sons of God a man blows up hm a woman oh
[1:04:02] I ain't going to listen to that anymore
[1:04:03] I don't have all right now go ahead
[1:04:06] illegitimate that's exactly but a real
[1:04:08] child of God will take his correction
[1:04:10] saying yes Father it's your word I've
[1:04:12] got to straighten up now I've got to do
[1:04:15] what's
[1:04:17] right am right well then the altar
[1:04:21] should have been full the other day when
[1:04:22] Brother D preached what he preached we
[1:04:24] got a lot of confession to do that we
[1:04:25] ain't doing I think we ped the point
[1:04:27] where we don't need a confess our sins
[1:04:28] anymore yeah you know that's truth isn't
[1:04:31] it an illegitimate is the one that's
[1:04:32] always backs off and flying the soup
[1:04:35] yeah to just kind of upset something
[1:04:38] like I told you you got that stubborn
[1:04:40] stinking spirit in this church yeah
[1:04:42] nothing but a fly ointment but the real
[1:04:44] child of God admires to be rebuked and
[1:04:47] straightened up
[1:04:48] admires I know my old father never wh me
[1:04:51] one time but what I bless every lick he
[1:04:53] hit me to make me what right if I
[1:04:56] wouldn't have been for that well I'd
[1:04:57] probably been a renegade myself so I
[1:05:00] that's what the matter with too many
[1:05:01] little Ricky and so forth today you let
[1:05:03] them run out here and throw around and
[1:05:05] stomp their foot and little Mary says I
[1:05:07] just won't do that she ought have had my
[1:05:10] mother that's right yes sir we got too
[1:05:13] much of now just letting the kids no
[1:05:15] wonder we got juvenile delinquency you
[1:05:17] know what caused it parent delinquency
[1:05:20] right and that's the truth people right
[1:05:22] from right here back yeah that's the
[1:05:24] truth we've let our kids get by with too
[1:05:27] much stuff that's what started it yes
[1:05:29] sir you don't keep your children around
[1:05:33] you there's the key you don't keep your
[1:05:36] children around you let them out in
[1:05:38] these places and carry on like that and
[1:05:40] endorsing
[1:05:41] it no wonder we're in such an
[1:05:44] age as we are now amen so let's go to
[1:05:48] number
[1:05:49] 14 seal of the Antichrist we have time
[1:05:52] for everything else now look this is not
[1:05:56] 1955 we have time for everything else no
[1:05:59] time for prayer meetings same thing with
[1:06:02] a lot of you you won't come to Bible
[1:06:03] study cuz you got something to do that
[1:06:04] night well what is it better than coming
[1:06:06] to bible study yeah sorry people if the
[1:06:10] word of God's not going to be first in
[1:06:11] your life then God's not first in your
[1:06:13] life right all right the homes all
[1:06:15] butchered up and the girls and boys are
[1:06:17] out going around lking around the
[1:06:19] country and mothers and fathers
[1:06:21] unconcerned and yet Pentecostal see
[1:06:23] that's where a lot of mothers and
[1:06:25] fathers have transferred that concern to
[1:06:26] the pastors and the deacons and yeah you
[1:06:29] we'll read it in just a minute what we
[1:06:31] need tonight is a home altar in the
[1:06:33] house house
[1:06:36] house a place where God where the
[1:06:38] Bible's read and children are taught the
[1:06:40] word of the Living God Amen yes
[1:06:44] sir now look let's go to the next one
[1:06:49] children obviously we're not supposed
[1:06:52] to be be them all the time unless they
[1:06:55] need
[1:06:56] it but they're supposed to be
[1:06:58] love and this is me talking to you we
[1:07:02] invest our time in a lot of things but
[1:07:05] have we invested our time in our
[1:07:06] children right amen invest a period of
[1:07:09] time Miss Wesley invested two hours of
[1:07:12] her day every day and sat down with her
[1:07:15] 17
[1:07:17] kids they had to be a dirty diaper in
[1:07:20] there somewhere they had to be one that
[1:07:22] was tired and had to be one that was
[1:07:24] hungry yeah but she took 2 hours out of
[1:07:27] her day sat down and talked to those 17
[1:07:32] children about God I'd say 15 of them
[1:07:34] were pretty good too but she raised two
[1:07:36] that were Mighty Men of God right all
[1:07:38] right and she did it never said much
[1:07:39] about her daddy I mean their dad but
[1:07:41] their mother did the rais it y all right
[1:07:44] but children need to be loved we need to
[1:07:45] take the time and
[1:07:47] invest invest this was right here
[1:07:49] Susanna Wesley all right let's read it
[1:07:52] I'll tell you I think today we have such
[1:07:54] a juvenile crime wave Across the Nation
[1:07:56] but really I think it started in the
[1:08:00] church oh it didn't say that oh it says
[1:08:03] in the
[1:08:04] home I think the the parents began to
[1:08:08] let go and if the child had been raised
[1:08:10] up in a good oldfashioned Godly home I
[1:08:13] don't say it would be all over certainly
[1:08:15] not but it would certainly give that
[1:08:17] child the right kind of influence right
[1:08:20] I think many times that homes that
[1:08:22] children has been brought up Wrong Turn
[1:08:24] loose on the street and just live from
[1:08:26] themselves while the mother stay in a
[1:08:27] barroom or the father and so forth they
[1:08:30] don't take care of this kid another
[1:08:32] thing they don't love it and give it the
[1:08:34] affection remember brother Brown told us
[1:08:36] said if you don't love them somebody
[1:08:37] else will why because they're like a
[1:08:40] sponge all right so invest time in your
[1:08:42] children they don't love it and give it
[1:08:45] the affections to take it up it's young
[1:08:47] you got to teach it to love and respect
[1:08:49] you got to teach it that teach it to
[1:08:52] love you can't respect is just not in
[1:08:54] built in a person you got to teach them
[1:08:56] how to love and how to respect and to
[1:08:58] read the Bible I think of Susanna Wesley
[1:09:00] I think she had 17 children I think
[1:09:02] that's right but she found 2 hours or
[1:09:05] more every day to pray down at the end
[1:09:08] of her dress where the little boy's
[1:09:09] nailed around out of there produced a
[1:09:11] John and Charles that changed the course
[1:09:13] of the world saved the world in that day
[1:09:15] she didn't have a washing machine and a
[1:09:17] dryer as we have the day in the
[1:09:18] dishwasher and so forth are aade the
[1:09:21] thing that she did it all herself but
[1:09:23] yet she could find time because she was
[1:09:24] putting an influence to some children
[1:09:27] that finally changed the course of the
[1:09:28] world I think that's the oldfashioned
[1:09:30] mother the oldfashioned home with prayer
[1:09:32] and the understanding of the Bible amen
[1:09:35] so we need to nurture cultivate what did
[1:09:38] she do she cultivated those children she
[1:09:40] took them out she saw maybe Charles and
[1:09:43] them were were a little bit special but
[1:09:44] I don't think she set them aside but she
[1:09:47] knew in her
[1:09:48] mind that those two guys were special
[1:09:51] amen now look
[1:09:54] that's number 15 number
[1:09:57] 16 let's talk about the home
[1:10:02] environment the home environment just
[1:10:04] for a minute cuz this is where it
[1:10:07] starts we only got two or three hours
[1:10:09] here people on Satur on Sunday and hour
[1:10:12] and a half or two hours on Wednesday
[1:10:14] where do they spend most of their time
[1:10:17] at home or should be at home you know
[1:10:21] what I think everybody has their own
[1:10:23] opinion
[1:10:24] but one of the greatest to my opinion
[1:10:27] the greatest presidents ever had in this
[1:10:29] nation was Abraham Lincoln now not
[1:10:31] because he was a republican because he
[1:10:33] was what he was a godly man and he was
[1:10:36] raised he and he to serve God he said if
[1:10:40] there's anything that I want to give
[1:10:41] praise to he said or my life was
[1:10:44] influenced by was a Godly mother who
[1:10:46] taught me to pray and know Jesus as my
[1:10:47] savior oh your family is what you are
[1:10:51] right amen you rais your child in a
[1:10:53] certain environment it's got a 99%
[1:10:55] better chance to go right than it has if
[1:10:57] you bring it up in the wrong way bring
[1:10:59] up a child in the way it should go when
[1:11:01] it's old it will not depart from you be
[1:11:03] brought up right teach your children to
[1:11:05] do right be
[1:11:07] honest be square and fair right even
[1:11:10] when they're in
[1:11:12] school all right let's go to the next
[1:11:14] one questions and answers brother Brown
[1:11:16] what achievement should we let our
[1:11:18] pre-teen children participate in I beg
[1:11:20] your pardon what activities should our
[1:11:22] pre pre-teen children anticipate uh
[1:11:25] participate in also how should we go
[1:11:27] about helping them select their
[1:11:29] Associates keep them in Christian
[1:11:31] company as long as you possibly can keep
[1:11:35] them with if it's a girl keep her with
[1:11:36] Christian
[1:11:38] girls now let me give you a point there
[1:11:41] he said Christian he didn't say people
[1:11:43] believe the
[1:11:45] message there's a
[1:11:47] difference the difference is what gets
[1:11:49] us in trouble yeah if it's a girl keeper
[1:11:52] with Christian girls Christian boys vice
[1:11:54] versa if she's old enough to go with a
[1:11:56] boy see that she keeps with the right
[1:11:58] kind of boy see that she keeps with the
[1:12:01] right kind of boy right discourage
[1:12:04] her discourage her to any boy otherwise
[1:12:09] or boy to a girl if she's going with an
[1:12:12] unbeliever try to encourage her to go
[1:12:14] with a Believer and vice versa here's
[1:12:16] the point make your home nice cuz we're
[1:12:18] going to talk about applying a token
[1:12:19] right here at the end make your home
[1:12:21] nice make your home a place where your
[1:12:24] daughter or son will not be ashamed to
[1:12:26] bring their company before their father
[1:12:28] and mother and into their house and make
[1:12:31] home so happy that they'll be pleased in
[1:12:33] their home to stay there oh my he's
[1:12:36] talking about here seven in a row he's
[1:12:37] talking about the U questions to go all
[1:12:40] right so now the next one that was
[1:12:43] nurturing the next one we're going to
[1:12:45] talk about is admonition what is the
[1:12:48] word admonition to teach and correct
[1:12:53] right now look remember the schools
[1:12:55] youth camps and churches are not to take
[1:12:58] the place of what God has ordained the
[1:13:00] family to
[1:13:02] do not to take the place this doesn't
[1:13:04] take the place what you do at home right
[1:13:06] you're supposed to raise them at home
[1:13:09] right what I said children does not

[1:14:33] it's a slap to you if you have to tell
[1:14:35] me about your children right exactly
[1:14:38] right then right amen it's a father and
[1:14:40] a mother's responsibility to raise your

[1:14:50] the parent has a wrong attitude then
[1:14:51] we're going to go to brother Dale find
[1:14:52] out and see what going on right CU they
[1:14:54] a spirit in there somewhere but
[1:14:56] admonition raise them up in the nurture
[1:14:58] and admonition to teach and to
[1:15:01] correct so that's your job to teach and
[1:15:04] to correct let's go to Deuteronomy
[1:15:08] 6 this what I was talking about a few
[1:15:10] minutes ago and these words which I
[1:15:12] command thee this day shall be in thine
[1:15:14] heart what God's talking to them and
[1:15:16] thou shalt teach them diligently that
[1:15:19] word diligently means forcefully I mean
[1:15:22] just every day
[1:15:24] diligently unto thy children and shall
[1:15:26] talk of them when thou sest in thine
[1:15:30] house and when thou west by the way and
[1:15:32] when thou liest down and when thou
[1:15:34] risest up and thou shalt bind them for a
[1:15:37] sign upon thine hand and they shall be
[1:15:40] as frontlets between thine eyes that's
[1:15:42] right
[1:15:43] here and thou shalt write them upon the
[1:15:45] post of thy house and on thy Gates what
[1:15:49] the Commandments that God's given he's
[1:15:50] giv them the Commandments that's what
[1:15:51] he's telling them to do put them there
[1:15:53] all right let's go to number
[1:15:55] 18 talk about wealth in the church while
[1:15:58] there never has been such a show of
[1:16:00] wealth the beautiful sanctuaries are
[1:16:02] multiplied in numbers as never before
[1:16:04] the bearish groups VI with each other to
[1:16:06] see who can build the biggest and the
[1:16:07] loveliest and they build Education
[1:16:09] Centers worth unestimated
[1:16:11] millions and those buildings are used
[1:16:13] only an hour or two a
[1:16:16] week now that would not be such a
[1:16:19] terrible thing but they expect this
[1:16:21] little this is Brother Brown talking
[1:16:24] but they expect this little time spent
[1:16:26] by the children in the education plant
[1:16:29] to take the place of the hours of
[1:16:31] training supposed to be given in the
[1:16:35] home in the home
[1:16:39] amen that's your Prophet number
[1:16:43] 19 Third Exodus now we got a little bit
[1:16:46] longer about 25 minutes if you don't
[1:16:47] mind conre says amen I want to continue
[1:16:50] this tape just a minute he's taping it
[1:16:52] notice the king that new king that
[1:16:53] raised up that didn't know Joseph what
[1:16:55] was his first scheme to destroy the
[1:16:57] power of Israel was with their
[1:16:59] children right Satan has
[1:17:03] always remember he tried he killed
[1:17:05] Abel he went in and he tried to kill the
[1:17:08] children of Israel or the yeah the
[1:17:09] children of Israel the little babies to
[1:17:11] try to get Moses right same way with
[1:17:14] Jesus when he Herod heard he was 2 years
[1:17:16] old and Below he had all them babies
[1:17:18] killed so God starts with destroying
[1:17:20] children I mean sorry Satan starts with
[1:17:22] destroy ding
[1:17:24] children okay
[1:17:26] look what was the first scheme to D
[1:17:29] destroy the power of Israel was with
[1:17:30] their children remember the sons of God
[1:17:32] saw the daughters of men back before
[1:17:33] that what brought them together started
[1:17:35] having children that's right
[1:17:37] congregation said that man he tried to
[1:17:38] destroy their children now listen close
[1:17:40] that same Devil in a different form of a
[1:17:42] kingship tried to destroy God's only son
[1:17:45] remember in in herod's time the Devil is
[1:17:47] a real smart shrewd bird he knows how to
[1:17:50] hit the thing before it gets started he
[1:17:51] knows it see and the only thing now
[1:17:54] here's what you do the only thing you
[1:17:55] ever do to beat him is rely on Christ
[1:17:58] and humble yourself and let him lead you
[1:18:00] see you'll never do it any other way
[1:18:02] your intellectual Powers will never do
[1:18:04] it right now listen to this you got to
[1:18:09] believe it just rely on him he is the
[1:18:11] shepherd it ain't the Sheep's business
[1:18:13] to keep the wolf away right right it's
[1:18:17] the shepherd's business our father right

[1:18:33] stay safe that's my safety zone is in
[1:18:36] Christ and Christ is the word that's the

[1:29:57] and then when it departs it'll come back
[1:29:59] to you all right it also says spare the
[1:30:01] rods full the child um I believe in
[1:30:03] spanking children but I don't believe in
[1:30:05] spanking them with an open hand or
[1:30:07] something real cuz you can really get in
[1:30:09] trouble um their bones are real fragile
[1:30:14] but like Dy said I know some people on
[1:30:15] the internet doesn't know what a keen
[1:30:17] Hickory but the word Keen is is is real
[1:30:20] kind real thin yeah it's real thin that
[1:30:24] hurts but it amen that hurts but it's
[1:30:28] not going to kill them right just get a
[1:30:30] little a little all you know what the
[1:30:32] Lord grows them all during the
[1:30:33] springtime he just makes them things
[1:30:34] grow out about this long and just puts
[1:30:37] them there for Mom and Daddy to get and
[1:30:39] don't take them one about that long you
[1:30:41] better go down about where the Roots
[1:30:42] come out of the ground cuz if you don't
[1:30:44] they going to go out there and get to a
[1:30:45] three but kids remember one thing I know
[1:30:48] listen to me kids your mom and daddies
[1:30:50] love you yeah
[1:30:52] if they're trying to raise you in the
[1:30:53] admonition and and the nurturing of the
[1:30:55] Lord You're a blessed
[1:30:58] child cuz you look at what goes on out
[1:31:00] here in the world with mixed marriages
[1:31:02] and mixed families and all this stuff
[1:31:04] and and uh most people out in the world
[1:31:07] consider their child a burden not a
[1:31:09] blessing yeah right they're considered a
[1:31:13] burden not a blessing if your mom and
[1:31:16] dad require you to go to church and sit
[1:31:18] in church and listen to some old boring
[1:31:20] guy that's
[1:31:23] okay you'll not forget
[1:31:26] it your mom and dad is the greatest
[1:31:28] thing you got outside of your salvation
[1:31:30] kids right right and kids God has
[1:31:33] purpose that we do raise kids that we
[1:31:35] this not a surprise not something God's
[1:31:37] not got already ready for us yeah he got
[1:31:39] everything we we need like I said make a
[1:31:42] sound biblical based decision on
[1:31:44] anything you do right don't whip them in
[1:31:46] haste right stop it's kind of like
[1:31:50] crossing the road stop look look and
[1:31:52] listen yeah both ways listen to them
[1:31:56] then do like Daddy did he talked to you
[1:31:58] about 10 or 15 minutes and then he whip
[1:32:00] you the whipping didn't hurt so bad it
[1:32:02] was the talking to cuz I knew I was
[1:32:04] going to get it at the end of the
[1:32:05] talking all right let's stand you love
[1:32:09] the Lord
[1:32:11] amen not a surprise that we have a
[1:32:14] family right and we still got to live in
[1:32:16] this world right as a
[1:32:19] family and you know the world had come
[1:32:22] to an end yet so we got a generation
[1:32:24] that's coming up we got a generation
[1:32:27] that's now facing challenges that you
[1:32:30] and I didn't have to face right but God
[1:32:33] didn't leave them alone right amen I you
[1:32:37] know I wish that we would have when we
[1:32:39] first started that we' have had
[1:32:43] enough Youth and all time to to to
[1:32:46] nurture us when we were going to church
[1:32:48] but that didn't happen I that's okay
[1:32:50] that it didn't happen
[1:32:52] but now you don't have an excuse parents
[1:32:56] we got an information we got the message
[1:32:59] all of it we got the whole 1100
[1:33:00] something sermon you can put it in your
[1:33:02] computer if you need to know something
[1:33:03] about how to handle a situation sure
[1:33:06] it's fine to call Brother Dale or you
[1:33:07] can call me it doesn't matter to me
[1:33:08] that's okay
[1:33:10] amen but your responsibility is to raise
[1:33:13] your
[1:33:15] children and men I've always already
[1:33:17] told you don't be blind to these things
[1:33:20] look over at your
[1:33:22] wife if she ain't got on the right
[1:33:24] clothes tell her she ain't got on the
[1:33:26] right clothes amen kids look over at the
[1:33:29] kids can it go on the right
[1:33:31] cloth it's your responsibility it's a
[1:33:34] reflection on you as a parent right amen
[1:33:37] when that happens as long as they're
[1:33:39] here in church you know as long as
[1:33:40] they're under your leadership and now if
[1:33:42] they go out somewhere and come back you
[1:33:44] can't control what they wear and what
[1:33:45] they do if they come back to church on
[1:33:47] Easter and Christmas like most of them
[1:33:48] do and I did the same thing for years
[1:33:51] all right
[1:33:52] but remember one
[1:33:55] thing got to keep Church clean remember
[1:33:58] one thing it's your responsibility cuz
[1:34:01] God give to you to raise brother D's not
[1:34:03] going to be responsible for the raising
[1:34:05] of your children he's responsible for
[1:34:07] the raising of you and you got to listen
