[0:18] today i faced a mountain
[0:23] that i had no strength to climb
[0:31] and the struggles of my journey
[0:34] left me weak
[0:36] open body
[0:38] and in mind
[0:44] from where i stand to the peak
[0:47] is a distance
[0:49] on my own
[0:50] i cannot read
[0:57] so this journey of a thousand steps
[1:00] again
[1:02] right here on my knees
[1:08] so i'll sow like an eagle
[1:15] high on wings
[1:28] so i can almost see god's face
[1:35] rising in his splendor
[1:50] look like a mountain

[2:02] i may face things tomorrow
[2:07] i can't comprehend today

[9:18] reading this morning from romans 7.
[9:23] and from exodus 19
[9:26] and we'll try to
[9:27] continue our thought
[9:29] and remember now the bible study will be

[9:33] saturday i was thinking this coming
[9:34] weekend but it's not
[9:36] let this be the first saturday in july
[9:40] remember the fellowship meeting will be

[9:49] announced i seem like the 12th this
[9:51] morning i believe it's 11
[9:53] for the sunday service but just remember
[9:55] that remember to pray for wade and june
[9:57] and them be flying back tomorrow
[9:58] afternoon
[9:59] and pray that the lord would bless them
[10:01] and and deal with them there and give
[10:03] them a good understanding
[10:05] of thy word and we sent them a little
[10:08] message this morning
[10:09] and
[10:10] told them they'd have to listen to the
[10:12] tape to
[10:13] evening message maybe to catch on to
[10:15] what was going on but brother
[10:17] anderson's sister anna it's
[10:20] going to be parents but
[10:22] he couldn't wait he had to call and
[10:23] brother joe and them explained it to him
[10:25] brother anderson so they got the message
[10:28] but we pray that the lord would
[10:30] would
[10:31] be with them on the way home tomorrow
[10:33] amen
[10:34] so romans 7 is
[10:37] exodus 19.
[10:39] heavenly father we thank you lord for
[10:41] your grace and your love unto us thank
[10:43] you for everything father
[10:45] thank you for calvary thank you for
[10:47] loving us
[10:48] thank you lord for giving us your grace
[10:50] and understanding
[10:52] but now what we need is is the grace is
[10:54] there lord but we truly need
[10:56] understanding of you and
[10:58] how that you deal with us and what it's
[11:00] all about
[11:02] so we pray that you just come and speak
[11:04] to our hearts and give us of your love
[11:07] most of all forgive our sins
[11:09] and guide each and every one of us lord
[11:11] lead us by that understanding in jesus
[11:13] name
[11:14] amen
[11:16] romans 7 really enjoyed that song
[11:20] to god there is no mountains
[11:23] there's a little bit of hills right
[11:24] there
[11:26] to him it is because he's great didn't
[11:27] he
[11:30] romans 7
[11:31] know ye not brethren for i speak to them
[11:33] that know the law how does the law have
[11:35] dominion over man as long as he liveth
[11:38] for the woman which hath and husband is
[11:39] bound by the law to her husband as long
[11:41] as he liveth but if the husband be dead
[11:45] she is loosed from the law of her
[11:46] husband
[11:47] so then
[11:48] if while her husband liveth she'll be
[11:50] married to another man she shall be
[11:52] called an adulteress but if her husband
[11:55] be dead she is free from that law so
[11:57] that she is no adulteress though she'll
[11:59] be married to another man
[12:01] wherever my brethren ye also are become
[12:03] dead to the law by the body of christ
[12:06] that you should
[12:09] be married to another even to him who is
[12:11] raised from the dead that we should
[12:13] bring forth fruit under god for when we
[12:15] were in the flesh the motions of sin
[12:17] which were by the law
[12:20] did work in our members to bring it
[12:22] bring forth
[12:23] fruit unto death see the law couldn't
[12:25] deliver anybody
[12:28] and it was working in now we'll get to
[12:31] this later eventually
[12:33] and it's going to sound odd but you
[12:35] listen to it the law was weak the
[12:37] scripture said
[12:41] it couldn't produce
[12:43] right even though it was god's word
[12:47] it was weak in the man that it was in
[12:50] so you'll get that scripture seeing
[12:52] it'll open up see for when we were in
[12:54] the flesh the motions of sin which were
[12:56] by the law did work in our members
[12:58] bringing to bring forth fruit unto death
[13:01] but now we are delivered from the law
[13:03] that being dead wherein we were held
[13:05] that we should serve in the newness of
[13:07] spirit and not in the oldness of the
[13:10] letter now we go to
[13:13] exodus
[13:15] 19
[13:17] verse 3 and read
[13:22] moses went up unto god and the lord god
[13:24] called unto him out of the mountain
[13:26] saying
[13:27] thus shalt thou say to the house
[13:29] of jacob and tell the children of israel
[13:32] see covering jacob israel everything's
[13:34] him
[13:36] you have seen what i did unto the
[13:38] egyptians how i bury you on eagle's
[13:40] wings and brought you unto myself
[13:43] now therefore
[13:45] if you will obey my voice indeed and
[13:47] keep my commandment keep my covenant so
[13:50] you know remember unconditional
[13:53] then you shall be a peculiar treasure
[13:55] unto me
[13:57] above all people
[13:58] for all the earth is mine
[14:00] and you shall be unto me a kingdom of
[14:02] priest and a holy nation
[14:05] these are the words which thou shalt
[14:06] speak unto the children of israel
[14:08] moses came and called the elders of the
[14:11] people and laid before their faces
[14:14] all these words which the lord commanded
[14:16] him
[14:17] and the people answered together see how
[14:19] everybody
[14:21] in union together and said
[14:23] all that the lord has spoken
[14:26] we will do
[14:27] moses returned the words of the people
[14:29] unto the lord you may be seated lord add
[14:33] his blessing
[14:34] to the reading of the word
[14:36] now
[14:39] i hope he was
[14:41] following with me and enjoyed the
[14:44] message this morning
[14:46] i enjoyed preaching it so
[14:48] if i run out of voice this afternoon
[14:50] i hollered a little bit too much this
[14:52] morning i guess but
[14:54] we'll not worry about it we can whisper
[14:57] you know all right but
[15:01] talking about the unconditional covenant
[15:05] now see that covenant was made
[15:08] not on conditions
[15:13] but there were a lot of conditions that
[15:14] caused that covenant to come into
[15:17] existence
[15:19] a lot of things happened and god
[15:22] brought it to mankind
[15:24] and brother branham said even with
[15:26] israel
[15:28] and that was back you know coming with
[15:30] the children of israel
[15:32] that
[15:32] even though they backslid and went down
[15:34] to egypt
[15:36] he said they lost the promise you know
[15:38] or something like that many different
[15:40] wordings of that first part but he said
[15:43] they never lost their covenant right
[15:46] so then when you come to
[15:48] this situation
[15:50] don't think about it even the children
[15:52] of israel because we'll read one in a
[15:54] minute we get time
[15:56] that even though they chose law
[16:00] and they you know and all but still
[16:03] they never lost the covenant
[16:06] that covenant is still waiting upon
[16:08] israel
[16:09] to be completed
[16:11] in the redemptive form of
[16:14] salvation through the 144 000 that will
[16:17] come in after us you know and there's
[16:20] still a lot to be dealt with with them
[16:22] but
[16:23] they never lost their covenant
[16:25] and us as the children of abraham
[16:28] the seed of abraham by faith
[16:31] by the new birth
[16:33] the
[16:33] we may do a lot of things and mess up on
[16:36] a lot of things but just remember we've
[16:38] never lost the covenant that's right
[16:40] and he's always good to that covenant
[16:42] and we'll keep it right
[16:44] and if you're born again
[16:46] that is the only one the covenant is two
[16:51] those that are born again are the only
[16:52] people that are under an unconditional
[16:55] covenant
[16:56] in the way that god wanted it to be
[16:59] that's why israel when her climax of her
[17:02] redemption is the best way of saying it
[17:04] they will come to a
[17:06] new birth or whatever you want to call
[17:08] it
[17:09] and they'll receive the finality of it
[17:12] until then they're waiting on that but
[17:15] you know god is still just sitting there
[17:17] the prophet of god said he comes down
[17:18] every day and heals the people
[17:20] of israel he said even though they don't
[17:22] receive him
[17:24] why because he's keeping his word
[17:26] all right so just remember now
[17:28] the unconditional covenant is always
[17:30] somebody came by the office and asked me
[17:33] today
[17:34] and that's true
[17:35] the only the only to the born-again
[17:37] believer is the one that's under the
[17:39] unconditional covenant everybody else
[17:41] has still
[17:42] got problems in you know in their doings
[17:44] because that's what it brought over at
[17:46] calvary
[17:48] calvary brought into manifestation
[17:51] i'll say calvary because that was worth
[17:53] it
[17:54] the price was paid
[17:55] and then the baptism of the holy ghost
[17:57] coming into new birth see then when that
[17:59] happened then
[18:01] you know it brought us into truly the
[18:04] unconditional covenant
[18:07] so i just go out and live like i want to
[18:08] brother dale that goes to prove you're
[18:10] not born again
[18:12] amen
[18:13] i've tried to express that to you and
[18:15] try to get you to look at it
[18:17] in the correct way
[18:19] of what an unconditional covenant is
[18:22] that even with israel
[18:25] even though god gave abraham an
[18:27] unconditional covenant
[18:29] he went right on offering sacrifices
[18:35] now if you say
[18:37] well it's just unconditional it don't
[18:39] matter what i do
[18:41] then you're gonna have to deal with
[18:42] abraham because he offered sacrifices
[18:45] the rest of his life
[18:46] and so did the people
[18:49] before moses came into being
[18:52] in on the law then they really did have
[18:53] sacrifices to offer and a book kept of
[18:56] how many they had to do
[19:00] but you see that way then it's
[19:02] truly an unconditional covenant grace
[19:05] is grace but let's don't make it
[19:07] disgrace
[19:09] see we strive
[19:11] to try to reach that as a part that
[19:13] talks about you know striving for the
[19:15] mastery you know and that thing during
[19:17] the scripture
[19:18] for the high calling
[19:21] and why wouldn't we want to repent but i
[19:24] hope you caught the point i was making
[19:25] this morning of breaking the difference
[19:27] in the sacrifice before the law was
[19:30] instituted to bring a a covenant for all
[19:33] israel under moses
[19:35] back then each person gave a sacrifice
[19:39] for their own sins
[19:42] and that's the way it is with you and i
[19:43] so just remember those things i would
[19:46] invite you to go back and listen to that
[19:47] message and those who hear this and
[19:50] hasn't heard it i please
[19:52] ask you to go listen to the message
[19:55] and listen
[19:56] you know
[19:57] to try to understand all right
[20:00] now
[20:04] my point this afternoon we'll be talking
[20:07] about
[20:08] law instead of grace
[20:13] law instead of grace
[20:17] but the point will be to ask you in our
[20:19] question
[20:23] which do we want
[20:27] which do we want
[20:30] law or grace
[20:35] now what if you'd have been standing
[20:36] before israel when they were
[20:38] in their journey and their doings and
[20:41] even when they had come up to this point
[20:45] of saying here in exodus whatever you
[20:47] say do we'll do
[20:50] you know the prophet said that they
[20:51] chose law so we'll read a bit of that
[20:53] this afternoon but
[20:56] do you really think
[21:00] that they wanted
[21:03] a book of rules to keep
[21:08] i'm just serious i want you to think
[21:10] about this
[21:13] do you think that they really wanted a
[21:15] book of rules
[21:20] because remember now they said
[21:22] lord whatever you say do
[21:24] will do
[21:26] right
[21:27] now what if the lord would have said
[21:32] now each one of you
[21:35] has got to put a 100 pound sack on your
[21:37] back and carry it the rest of your life
[21:44] you see you're just being silly
[21:47] no i'm making statements that when we
[21:49] continue the thought
[21:51] throughout the message even later
[21:56] you will understand what was going on
[21:58] with those people
[22:01] did they want
[22:03] a set of
[22:06] bondage
[22:10] i mean do you think they wanted some
[22:11] bondage to be put under
[22:15] you know
[22:17] do you think that everyone wanted to
[22:20] and i know i'm silly
[22:24] but if god would have said all right now
[22:27] what i want you to do is i want every
[22:28] one of you cut your left foot off
[22:34] well you know they said whatever you say
[22:35] to
[22:37] now i'm getting serious about that not
[22:39] silly
[22:41] because i'm asking you the question
[22:45] what do you think was going on in that
[22:47] situation
[22:50] what did they want
[22:52] and the prophet would say they wanted
[22:53] something to do
[22:56] and how simple is
[23:00] the things that they wanted to do
[23:07] and i ask you and i the question
[23:10] do we want law or grace
[23:19] what do you think was meant when they
[23:20] said it
[23:22] and god said through the prophet to us
[23:24] in this end time
[23:27] that israel chose law
[23:30] instead of grace
[23:36] now i've tried to get you to see it many
[23:38] many messages
[23:40] that you're in verse
[23:42] 3 4 5 6
[23:45] 7
[23:46] of exodus 19
[23:50] god is telling them how wonderful they
[23:51] are
[23:53] there are chosen people
[23:59] how beautiful he has made them
[24:03] under the covenant
[24:05] and remember when you get to here you've
[24:08] done had
[24:09] um
[24:10] close to 3 000 years of mankind
[24:13] i'm just giving a date but i don't know
[24:14] exactly but you know there was 2 000
[24:16] before the flood
[24:18] you know
[24:22] and all those people had to make
[24:23] sacrifices
[24:25] for their sins
[24:31] what was they wanting to do
[24:34] what if god would have said
[24:37] i want you to
[24:39] sacrifice your children
[24:44] you know oh no that ain't the bible
[24:47] i'm sorry that's right
[24:49] uh
[24:50] he told abraham to do it right
[24:53] all right
[24:59] but yet
[25:01] what do you think
[25:03] they were saying
[25:07] what you say do will do
[25:16] what if you went home today and told
[25:17] your husband or the wife you know the
[25:20] husband husband to the wife and said
[25:22] well now honey whatever you want me to
[25:24] do i'll do
[25:26] it i tell my wife said well i want
[25:30] a t-bone steak every night for supper
[25:34] for the next three months
[25:37] i would probably get a negative answer
[25:39] out of that would don't you think so i'm
[25:41] pretty sure she'll tell you she would
[25:46] do you understand my point
[25:54] what were they meaning as to say
[25:58] whatever you say
[26:00] will do
[26:04] all right
[26:07] remember the prophet will be covering
[26:09] that they chose law instead of grace
[26:17] they chose love for grace
[26:23] now this is maybe brother dale's way of
[26:25] saying it but
[26:28] i think i can prove the point with the
[26:30] prophet
[26:33] they chose law thinking it was grace
[26:44] if you understand what i'm saying i'm
[26:45] trying to make it as pointed blunt as i
[26:47] can but do you really think that they
[26:49] were wanting a book of rules
[26:56] do you think that was in their mind to
[26:58] want a book of rules
[27:00] like that form
[27:04] what were they wanting
[27:10] do you think they really wanted
[27:12] burden some things something horrible
[27:21] and why in the world
[27:24] would not they want
[27:26] what god had said about them
[27:31] now if he called him a bunch of dirty
[27:32] rascals sorry
[27:34] dogs
[27:35] you know
[27:39] you can understand maybe that
[27:41] they didn't want to fit in that category
[27:45] but they had as we'll prove a prophet
[27:50] a pillar of fire
[27:53] the atonement to be made
[27:59] the grace of god
[28:02] to them
[28:06] what would it be for them to
[28:09] want that would come down to you and i
[28:14] and we would be saying the same thing
[28:18] by our actions and reactions
[28:23] until you bless god brother that i don't
[28:24] want no law
[28:27] well
[28:40] do you believe
[28:42] yeah
[28:45] that israel was actually saying
[28:49] oh
[28:52] give us something to do
[28:56] and we'll do it out of love from our
[28:58] heart for you lord
[29:05] do you really think that
[29:14] see they wanted something they could do
[29:18] in their salvation now we're going to
[29:20] read these things
[29:22] no just hold it on till we get there you
[29:24] know
[29:29] and the prophet of god said it is the
[29:31] nature of man and has always been the
[29:34] nature of man
[29:37] always
[29:39] here all the way back
[29:43] to try to do something
[29:48] to save themselves
[29:55] we'll read these in a minute what about
[29:56] adam that
[30:00] as quick as he'd sinned
[30:03] instead of crying out father forgive me
[30:09] they run in the bushes and made some
[30:10] thick leaves
[30:13] you know for aprons
[30:16] and brother branham say it now if you
[30:18] need this one i'll be glad i didn't
[30:19] bring it today but be glad to get it he
[30:22] said there they were in the bushes
[30:24] having church
[30:27] amen
[30:31] they thought
[30:37] they thought within themselves
[30:40] that there was something wrong
[30:44] but they knew that god was coming down
[30:46] in the cool of the evening
[30:49] right has he done every day
[30:53] so he said how are we going to face him
[30:58] well let's get us some fig leaves
[31:10] man has always wanted something he could
[31:12] do to save himself
[31:19] but now before we read a lot of these i
[31:21] want your thoughts on one thing
[31:28] i believe this is me brother day also
[31:31] are
[31:34] i believe it to be backed up by the
[31:36] message
[31:39] i believe israel
[31:42] had looked around and seen the nations
[31:44] around them
[31:47] and they seen them with idols and images
[31:51] and
[31:53] things
[31:56] and they saw beautiful temples
[32:00] they saw
[32:01] people
[32:04] slaving seemingly
[32:08] but yet
[32:09] bringing to their gods
[32:14] the works of their own hands
[32:17] and their own thoughts
[32:23] well then could it be that they wanted
[32:25] to be like them
[32:29] now i'm putting this up front where you
[32:31] when the message comes you'll see my
[32:33] point
[32:36] could it be that they were not saying
[32:39] give me a book of rules to live by
[32:44] but they were saying let us figure out
[32:48] some way
[32:50] that we can
[32:52] satisfy god
[32:58] they looked around and seen the worship
[33:00] of all the others in their gods
[33:03] but yet they saw
[33:06] no temples
[33:09] no uh
[33:11] set place of worship
[33:14] remember there were vagabonds traveling
[33:18] no doing this but that
[33:25] could it be that they would be like
[33:30] peter
[33:32] on the mountain
[33:42] you know what brother brown says about
[33:43] peter on the mountain
[33:47] he said let us build three tabernacles
[33:49] one for thee one for moses one for a lot
[33:51] but have you read on what he says
[33:56] he says we'll make one denomination
[34:02] and we'll call it the law
[34:05] for moses
[34:08] he said we'll make another denomination
[34:10] we don't get that far today i know but
[34:12] we'll make another one for elijah
[34:15] and he represents god's
[34:18] justice and things
[34:23] they want to make three denominations
[34:28] now that's the way your prophet
[34:29] describes it
[34:35] so could it be that they were not
[34:36] wanting a book of rules
[34:39] or regulations
[34:44] but they just could not accept
[34:47] the fact of what god had to say about
[34:49] them
[34:54] could that fit our day
[34:57] could that fit lula georgia
[35:05] we would all like to have some way or do
[35:08] something to be able to
[35:10] serve god better right
[35:13] isn't that the thoughts of every one of
[35:14] us
[35:19] brother brown said it people told him he
[35:21] used to do this and to do that
[35:23] evidently he must win he said it's
[35:25] supposed to get down and bow down and
[35:27] fold her hands and pray you know
[35:34] he says anything wrong with that
[35:36] no
[35:40] but it don't work for everybody
[35:43] right
[35:46] see that's why we want something
[35:47] speaking in tongues shouting believing
[35:50] the message
[35:52] we want something that
[35:55] everybody
[35:56] can agree on
[35:59] remember we read there in the scripture
[36:01] it says they all
[36:04] answered
[36:06] to god
[36:12] maybe this thing was pre-planned
[36:18] they sure got all the people together on
[36:20] it
[36:21] you know
[36:27] but they looked around and they saw
[36:28] other nations and things around them
[36:32] and they saw those other nations
[36:35] serving their god
[36:43] later on it proved out to be true
[36:45] because they said give us a king like
[36:47] all the other nations
[36:52] right
[36:58] see eventually when we get to it we'll
[37:00] see that the prophet said they didn't
[37:02] get what they thought they got
[37:05] they thought they got a book of rules
[37:07] and a few things to do
[37:14] we said they got god in letter form
[37:17] that's what killed them
[37:19] it was the word of god
[37:24] but what if moses would have come down
[37:26] off the mountain okay and go up there
[37:28] and get what god wants us to do
[37:30] and what if he'd took a scroll or roll
[37:33] and he'd roll that thing out you know
[37:36] and it went all the way to the back
[37:39] in fine print
[37:41] you understand the point
[37:43] we got 8
[37:45] 942
[37:48] things that god wants you to do or not
[37:52] do
[37:55] you think they'd have put check marks on
[37:56] all of them and said we'll do it
[37:59] if they do i want to sell you some stock
[38:02] alcatraz for vacation home
[38:06] right
[38:07] not being silly it's truthful
[38:11] are you getting a point
[38:15] is it a thousand rules no
[38:18] because they didn't keep the 12 to 10.
[38:26] well they thought they would
[38:28] they knew their ancestors before about
[38:30] done anything
[38:35] but just think about it
[38:38] they wanted something to do to save
[38:40] themselves
[38:44] and they wanted to try to show
[38:47] the people
[38:50] the way they were serving their god and
[38:52] maybe even their god
[38:55] because remember
[38:58] when they made the golden calf
[39:04] right
[39:05] right
[39:06] what did they say
[39:12] we're going to go back down to egypt
[39:16] right was that what they said
[39:20] and he said
[39:21] we'll tell them
[39:24] he better not fool with us
[39:27] because here's the god that brought us
[39:28] out here
[39:30] they weren't going down there naked
[39:32] handed
[39:34] they were going to go back and tell
[39:35] those egyptians there's a god that
[39:38] destroyed you and he'll do it again bow
[39:40] down
[39:41] they wouldn't go back to slaves
[39:44] come on you'd think that's your carnal
[39:47] and your understanding
[39:51] they were going to go back it's
[39:52] victorious
[40:00] so
[40:03] any problems with what i said
[40:08] i believe they wanted to show the people
[40:11] around them
[40:14] their god
[40:16] and
[40:19] how he was and how they worshiped him
[40:26] and they were going to do things and not
[40:27] do things
[40:30] but when he give them what he gave them
[40:33] the prophet of god says it
[40:36] no man
[40:39] can keep
[40:40] the law
[40:46] now that's the words of your prophet
[40:48] you need it
[40:49] i read them off while i go there
[40:51] one i know laying on my desk
[40:55] no man can keep the law
[40:59] they never intended to keep
[41:02] what they said
[41:06] no no
[41:07] these people wanted something to make
[41:10] make them what
[41:17] if it was something for them to do
[41:19] it would mean
[41:20] nothing to do with the grace that god
[41:23] had given
[41:25] and he'd already given them grace
[41:27] so they certainly didn't want that
[41:32] they did not want a life lived
[41:34] by the love of god in their heart
[41:38] as i was trying to express this morning
[41:42] they wanted some way
[41:44] to atone
[41:47] for themselves
[41:53] all right
[41:55] now with that in mind let's just read a
[41:56] little bit and think on it
[42:03] if it was never as we'll read in a
[42:05] moment
[42:08] the will of god
[42:10] to give the law
[42:13] now so i know just going out people are
[42:15] listening
[42:18] and
[42:19] even the ones that are listening which
[42:21] i'm sure are basically the followers of
[42:23] the message and you know the prophet has
[42:24] said these things and we'll read them
[42:28] but
[42:30] i can read it out of the bible and read
[42:31] it from the prophet it's not going to
[42:32] convert anybody
[42:35] i've never tried that so i don't worry
[42:37] about it
[42:40] but how would you go down to a
[42:42] denominational church we're not throwing
[42:44] off on nobody just standing like it is
[42:47] and you go tell us it was never god's
[42:49] will to give the law
[42:50] what do you mean
[42:55] he brought him out of egypt
[42:57] he took him to the mountain
[43:01] and he gave him the law
[43:06] you mean you're saying that
[43:09] god wasn't going to do that
[43:18] do we believe the prophet
[43:24] see that puts it to where at least we we
[43:26] have a
[43:27] a mutual meeting ground that i can say
[43:30] do we believe the prophet you know
[43:32] see if he was talking organized religion
[43:34] it ain't who do you believe what
[43:35] who said what
[43:37] or who taught what
[43:39] well i've heard brother so-and-so
[43:40] explained it right down the line and god
[43:42] brought him out there to give that law
[43:44] i heard it before i came in this message
[43:47] of this
[43:50] that a man didn't even have a soul until
[43:52] the law came into existence
[43:55] i heard that for her this message
[43:59] i told a man i said
[44:01] well according to my bible it said and
[44:02] adam became a living soul
[44:06] he said that is right
[44:09] but you know it didn't stop him
[44:14] it didn't matter what the word said
[44:18] he had his own ideas we're going to find
[44:19] out that's what organized religion is
[44:26] it's our ideas
[44:31] now listen to this point
[44:35] they thought
[44:38] now this is me writing but now we're
[44:39] going to read it
[44:42] they thought
[44:43] they were right
[44:46] and that god would want them
[44:49] to think and do
[44:52] this way
[44:57] that they were asking about
[45:00] if not why would they want it
[45:06] are you understanding
[45:10] and i've always said it this way trying
[45:11] to make it straight
[45:12] i believe on the day of pentecost if
[45:14] peter said repent every one of
[45:17] you and
[45:18] be baptized in the name of jesus christ
[45:20] and stand on your head
[45:23] that would have been god's way
[45:26] you could do all the rest of it but if
[45:27] you didn't stand on your head
[45:30] right
[45:35] but see they thought
[45:38] they were right
[45:41] in asking
[45:42] for something to do
[45:46] or when would they ask it
[45:51] and they thought that was what god
[45:54] wanted
[45:59] about a year or so ago there was a lady
[46:01] run over her husband
[46:05] she backed up run over him again
[46:07] naturally killed him
[46:10] and asked her said why did you do that
[46:12] she said me and god is fed up with this
[46:17] she didn't say she was she said her and
[46:19] god was
[46:20] in other words god told her to run over
[46:22] the guy and then back up over and make
[46:24] sure you get him you know
[46:30] you say yeah but that's dumb kooks
[46:34] what's the difference in a dumb cook in
[46:36] an educated coop
[46:40] sorry what's the difference
[46:42] both unscooped
[46:44] you know people don't understand cooks
[46:46] no southern language number both of us
[46:48] crazy or just messed up
[46:51] i forget sometimes i'm talking that
[46:53] maybe i might be going to west africa
[46:58] well brother joe and then one time they
[46:59] got an email from somebody and i believe
[47:01] it was africa and they
[47:03] you know
[47:04] forgot which one but richard i know he
[47:06] was
[47:08] and they didn't know what a squirrel was
[47:12] you know and brother ryan said he spoke
[47:14] squirrels into existence they didn't
[47:15] know what a squirrel was because in that
[47:17] part of the country they didn't have any
[47:18] squirrels
[47:20] so they got him a picture put it on the
[47:22] internet and sent it back to it so maybe
[47:24] we need some pictures okay
[47:26] all right
[47:30] now listen
[47:33] let me say this again
[47:34] i like to read my own notes you know
[47:36] sometimes
[47:38] see they thought they were right
[47:40] and that god wanted them to think and do
[47:43] this way
[47:50] and this is all they needed to do
[47:55] even to bring them to calvary
[48:01] because they surely knew a little bit
[48:03] about the
[48:06] promises in god's word of what would
[48:08] take place
[48:10] back there you know
[48:11] at least they knew about the messiah was
[48:13] promised in genesis what about 3 15 when
[48:16] i put in between thy seed and the seed
[48:18] of the woman they knew that
[48:20] they were looking forward to those
[48:22] things
[48:23] job was
[48:26] well let's go ahead now and just read a
[48:27] little bit
[48:28] let your prophet answer some things and
[48:31] we'll go as far as we can we still got
[48:32] wednesday night go ahead with number one
[48:35] which is
[48:36] i ask you to to get this message and
[48:38] listen to it
[48:40] you can't do one thing you can click on
[48:41] your internet on your systems you know
[48:43] what i mean and you can just play it on
[48:44] your internet
[48:46] the church
[48:49] choosing law for grace
[48:52] now even the title
[48:54] church
[48:56] you know he's talking about us
[49:00] he's just illustrating about what they
[49:01] were
[49:04] choosing law for grace
[49:11] e14
[49:16] went from cadence there was only 11 days
[49:18] to the crossing
[49:21] they couldn't believe it
[49:23] because they had already seen so many
[49:25] great things done
[49:30] they were sure
[49:33] they were in the will of god
[49:40] just as our fathers was a few years ago
[49:44] and they were there's where they made
[49:46] their great fatal mistake they the
[49:48] greatest mistake that israel ever made
[49:51] was when it renounced grace
[49:56] marked him words
[49:59] and accepted law
[50:02] it made his greatest mistake
[50:04] in exodus 19
[50:07] was one of the fatal mistakes that
[50:09] israel made
[50:12] the covenant that god made with abraham
[50:15] was completely grace
[50:17] but grace had provided for them a
[50:19] deliverer a prophet a sacrificial lamb
[50:24] it had provided the greatest revival
[50:26] they'd ever had you know moses dancing
[50:29] and murray and run up down the banks you
[50:31] know singing in the spirit
[50:35] and yet
[50:37] they wasn't satisfied with it
[50:41] they wanted something that they could
[50:43] argue about
[50:47] uh more i'm going to get on
[50:50] these same quotes you're going to read
[50:51] them again wednesday
[50:53] and we're going to bring it over to
[50:54] where we are i'm trying today to keep it
[50:57] back there
[50:59] all right
[51:00] then comparison
[51:03] all right
[51:06] they wanted a place to where they could
[51:08] have something
[51:09] to do into it
[51:14] we'll read some quotes later where he
[51:15] says into their salvation
[51:18] and things
[51:21] but see they wanted something to do
[51:27] and what did we use up there when we
[51:29] talked about
[51:31] they were sure they were in the will of
[51:33] god
[51:37] just as our fathers
[51:39] was a few years ago
[51:43] listen
[51:47] god had provided them a deliverer a
[51:49] prophet lamb
[51:50] greatest revival but they weren't
[51:52] satisfied with it
[51:55] they renounced
[51:59] grace
[52:06] in other words they were saying god
[52:10] your ways
[52:12] won't bring to pass what we think
[52:15] is supposed to be right
[52:20] when would he say they renounce grace
[52:23] renounced grace means you turn it
[52:24] totally down
[52:26] renounce means you publicly
[52:29] right
[52:31] you publicly renounce
[52:38] and remember it was all of them that
[52:39] come up and said
[52:41] we publicly renounce the fact that you
[52:43] saved us by grace that you're with us
[52:45] and we want to do something ourselves
[52:55] they wasn't satisfied with the prophet
[52:57] being there that could tell them what to
[52:58] do
[53:00] come on
[53:02] later they wanted a king
[53:05] right
[53:09] they had a sacrificial lamb
[53:12] renounce grace and accepted law
[53:15] now
[53:17] do we want law or grace
[53:26] well brother dale i want grace
[53:30] well then evidently if they thought they
[53:32] were right
[53:34] they thought
[53:36] what they asked for
[53:38] was the grace of god
[53:41] are you with me
[53:44] i mean these weren't dummies you're
[53:46] dealing with okay
[53:49] these were the religious people
[53:54] and what about it go back there and
[53:56] study some of those things about them
[53:59] and how god would provide a way and
[54:01] maybe they would be scattered out all
[54:03] over the place and something would go
[54:04] wrong and he'd just send somebody they
[54:06] just all come together go defeat the
[54:08] enemy go right back to whole windows and
[54:10] gardens
[54:17] what about a god that could warn you of
[54:18] everything and tell you where the
[54:20] enemy's coming
[54:22] how he's going to come down is that in
[54:24] the scripture
[54:27] who was it the man said
[54:31] that they got a prophet over there and
[54:34] said he tells what goes on in the king's
[54:36] chamber
[54:41] come on folks
[54:46] so what happened then
[54:51] grace had provided a prophet
[54:54] a sacrificial lamb
[54:56] a great revival
[54:58] a covenant
[55:02] and it was all grace
[55:05] but they wanted something to do
[55:12] why is it then when we
[55:16] try to talk to people about god
[55:22] that we tell them what to do and not to
[55:24] do
[55:28] now do you want this quote
[55:31] i'll be glad to bring this
[55:32] one the prophet said people asked how to
[55:35] be saved said we tell them what to do
[55:37] and what not to do to be saved he said
[55:38] that ain't the question they asked they
[55:40] asked how to be saved
[55:42] and said we tell them a book of rules
[55:46] now come on
[55:55] why is it there's so much fruit been
[55:56] bruised
[55:58] by the people of this message
[56:01] let's drove people away from the message
[56:04] instead of to the message
[56:07] and all the preaching 40-something years
[56:11] i've never had
[56:14] a child out of this congregation
[56:16] to ever come and tell me brother to hell
[56:22] i wish you hadn't told me that
[56:26] i hate you because of your
[56:28] preaching i've never had one
[56:34] yet i've had even like my wife talking
[56:36] someone was and this girl said
[56:40] brother dale had a meeting with all of
[56:41] us girls and said
[56:43] he told us we'll not do these things
[56:49] come on kids is that right
[56:52] i'm talking about kids just growed up
[56:54] here
[56:58] have i ever told you anything
[57:01] come on we got rue i mean uh yeah ruth
[57:03] and robbie and rebecca and
[57:07] uh
[57:09] julie's been around us esther's been
[57:11] around us
[57:12] all of these has been around a long time
[57:14] joyce
[57:19] i've never tried to tell you anything
[57:21] wrong have a
[57:27] get off that
[57:30] go to number two
[57:32] you can't explain to people
[57:35] because they don't believe it
[57:37] you trying to tell me i didn't live
[57:38] right before my kids reason ain't saved
[57:40] yes
[57:46] is that loud enough
[57:50] why are they not here
[57:58] remember your kids know a whole lot more
[58:00] about your life than you think they know
[58:07] here's where we're at this morning we
[58:08] read
[58:09] does god's
[58:11] does god ever change his mind about his
[58:13] word 65 418 paragraph 95 90 and 96-97
[58:20] god permitted israel to take a law
[58:23] in exodus the 19th chapter
[58:25] when grace had already given them a
[58:27] prophet pillar fire sacrificial lamb
[58:29] delivering power
[58:30] but they cried out for a law
[58:34] it wasn't god's will
[58:38] but it was injected because man wanted
[58:42] it
[58:48] and he was cursed by the very law
[58:51] that he wanted
[58:56] you know that the bible says that before
[58:58] the law came there was no transgression
[59:04] come on are we in the bible
[59:06] amen
[59:09] you mean he wasn't
[59:10] no there wasn't a record keeper
[59:12] you're going to find out what he did
[59:13] what that law really is the law's a
[59:15] record keeper
[59:18] they didn't keep up with what everybody
[59:19] done until the law came into existence
[59:21] but when the law came into existence
[59:23] moses was smart enough he said hold it
[59:25] just a minute
[59:27] you keep a record joe come excuse me not
[59:29] joe
[59:30] jim jim committed adultery
[59:34] write her down
[59:38] that was never done that away until the
[59:40] law came into existence
[59:42] come on show me in the bible
[59:44] no
[59:46] before then you was condemned by this by
[59:48] the similitude of adam's transgression
[59:51] that's what the bible says
[59:53] it doesn't say condemned but it
[59:55] that's what happened
[59:57] before then it was you and god you and
[59:58] god you and god
[1:00:00] but when the law came into being and
[1:00:02] they brought them into a people it
[1:00:04] became record keepers
[1:00:13] but look
[1:00:15] cursed
[1:00:16] by the very law that they wanted
[1:00:20] it's best to have god's will
[1:00:23] now watch him
[1:00:25] that's what the thought that's what he
[1:00:27] thought what he taught us
[1:00:31] that will be done thy kingdom come then
[1:00:33] we'll be done
[1:00:34] we must submit ourselves to his will
[1:00:37] and his word
[1:00:39] don't question it believe it don't try
[1:00:42] to find a way around it
[1:00:44] just take it the way it is
[1:00:46] so many wants to go around
[1:00:49] get some other way
[1:00:56] when you do you find yourself going on
[1:00:59] and you find god blessing you
[1:01:04] right
[1:01:05] look brother dale look at all these
[1:01:07] churches out here look at what's going
[1:01:08] on
[1:01:10] you mean god yes god is blessing them
[1:01:17] yes sir
[1:01:19] but are they in the perfect will of god
[1:01:23] what do you say when you do you find
[1:01:24] yourself going on you find god blessing
[1:01:26] you but you're working in his permissive
[1:01:28] will
[1:01:29] and not in his perfect divine will
[1:01:32] he permits his and i said
[1:01:34] but he will not he will not let it be
[1:01:37] his perfect will
[1:01:40] he said well this this we're going to
[1:01:42] make this as per you
[1:01:46] permissive can lead out to perfect but
[1:01:49] permissive and perfect can't be put
[1:01:50] together two opposites right
[1:01:56] and it'd be his perfect will but he'll
[1:01:57] make it work
[1:01:59] to honor and bless his perfect will
[1:02:02] and he said in childbearing by sex is
[1:02:04] one of that
[1:02:06] he permits it
[1:02:08] when it's perfect will
[1:02:10] so what is it
[1:02:13] we read it the first one
[1:02:16] they said they thought they were right
[1:02:18] they thought they were in the will of
[1:02:20] god
[1:02:22] now we read it was not the will of god
[1:02:24] to give them the law
[1:02:27] as i said then that's hard for people to
[1:02:29] swallow because that's the word of god
[1:02:32] you're throwing up on the word of god
[1:02:34] because the word of god is what god
[1:02:35] wanted to give them
[1:02:39] not the way they wanted it
[1:02:41] he didn't give them what they wanted
[1:02:50] he never gave israel a book of rules to
[1:02:52] live
[1:02:53] show me
[1:02:59] he said well they start doing this
[1:03:01] go back before that happened and find
[1:03:03] out they were already doing that
[1:03:05] if you wouldn't listen to what i said
[1:03:07] this morning
[1:03:09] before exodus 19 they already had to
[1:03:11] profit the things in the following rules
[1:03:14] and regulations or right before god
[1:03:21] the law never brought a savior
[1:03:28] he brought a condemnation
[1:03:32] okay
[1:03:35] remember we read this one this morning
[1:03:36] abraham's covenant
[1:03:38] number
[1:03:39] three
[1:03:43] there is not nothing that we could do to
[1:03:46] merit it's god grace that gives it to us
[1:03:49] by faith
[1:03:50] abraham believed god and it was imputed
[1:03:52] to him for righteousness
[1:03:53] the law was what man wanted
[1:03:56] know what god wanted
[1:04:01] i just don't understand that because he
[1:04:03] gave him his word
[1:04:06] don't he want us to have his word
[1:04:12] he don't want us to have his word as a
[1:04:13] book of rules
[1:04:19] he does not want that
[1:04:21] he's always
[1:04:24] come on
[1:04:26] he even got to the place that he said
[1:04:28] i'm sick
[1:04:29] of your offerings
[1:04:31] he said they have become a stink in my
[1:04:33] nostrils but said a man with an honest
[1:04:36] and a contrite heart
[1:04:38] is what i long for
[1:04:41] what was the difference in abraham and
[1:04:42] the rest
[1:04:43] a man with an honest and a contrite
[1:04:45] heart
[1:04:50] see if it just stayed that away look
[1:04:52] what it would have been you know what
[1:04:53] brother branham said it would have been
[1:04:54] i don't have the quote laying here but
[1:04:56] we'll get it
[1:04:57] he said if they'd have went on had not
[1:04:59] done what they'd done in exodus 19 he
[1:05:02] said
[1:05:03] they would have crossed over
[1:05:06] jordan into the promised land
[1:05:09] and he said
[1:05:11] paraphrasing it the millennium would
[1:05:14] have been on hand
[1:05:17] and i wouldn't be like no but it would
[1:05:18] have brought it over closer
[1:05:22] realize when they walked into that
[1:05:23] promised land
[1:05:27] if they'd went in there with the right
[1:05:28] heart
[1:05:29] what is the what is the promised land
[1:05:31] what is canaan type of top of the
[1:05:32] baptism of the holy ghost right it's not
[1:05:34] a top of the millennium because you had
[1:05:36] battles
[1:05:37] in canaan
[1:05:38] if they'd walked right into that
[1:05:39] promised land with the right attitude
[1:05:41] christ would have come right there
[1:05:48] come on he's already been spoken of all
[1:05:49] the way through
[1:05:56] look at the next one number four
[1:06:00] this is jehovah gyra 1 62
[1:06:03] 705.
[1:06:07] now the covenant was given
[1:06:08] unconditionally now israel the seed
[1:06:10] natural exchange that
[1:06:13] now what exchanged it
[1:06:15] well because they thought they were
[1:06:17] writing what they were doing they
[1:06:19] exchanged it
[1:06:22] and lost it in exodus 19 when they made
[1:06:24] that rational thing to
[1:06:27] take away the grace
[1:06:33] now
[1:06:35] is your prophet telling us the
[1:06:37] interpretation of the word
[1:06:43] yet we can't read in the word where they
[1:06:45] said we don't want grace
[1:06:47] there is no such thing in there that man
[1:06:48] says he don't want grace
[1:06:51] but his actions and reactions turn down
[1:06:53] grace
[1:06:55] and he exchanged it
[1:06:58] for a book of rose
[1:07:01] and
[1:07:04] to take away the grace
[1:07:06] and accepted law and his praise
[1:07:09] what a rational racial rational ever how
[1:07:11] you say that
[1:07:12] r-a-s-a-t-l
[1:07:14] mistake that israel
[1:07:16] made there
[1:07:17] look god after he had made his covenant
[1:07:19] with abraham grace had already provided
[1:07:21] a prophet deliverer for them down in
[1:07:23] egypt to carry out the word of abraham
[1:07:26] remember moses under the
[1:07:28] bush god said i have heard the cries
[1:07:33] of my people and i
[1:07:35] remember my promise
[1:07:39] before there was any law
[1:07:44] is that what he done with
[1:07:45] abraham
[1:07:48] then when he come to moses what did he
[1:07:50] do
[1:07:52] before there was any law grace provided
[1:07:54] it grace had provided a sacrifice for
[1:07:57] their guilt a lamb grace had provided a
[1:07:59] covenant circumcision would have already
[1:08:01] been provided
[1:08:02] he's one of those things that was coming
[1:08:04] forth kept speaking of christ
[1:08:06] right
[1:08:09] was already been provided before law
[1:08:11] grace had provided a pillar of fire to
[1:08:13] lead them
[1:08:14] following a prophet as a security that
[1:08:16] the prophet and told them the truth it
[1:08:20] was the word that he was talking about
[1:08:22] they know that god promised it and there
[1:08:25] was the filler of fire confirming it
[1:08:28] what a double security amen grace
[1:08:31] had done that
[1:08:32] but they wanted something for themselves
[1:08:36] that they could do
[1:08:42] now what does he say that is
[1:08:44] have their own creeds
[1:08:48] and denominations
[1:08:54] you might wonder why i'm still reading
[1:08:55] romans 7 and all the titles of these
[1:08:58] sermons are on the internet still listed
[1:09:00] is marriage and divorce
[1:09:05] when we got onto law and grace
[1:09:10] we're going to find out
[1:09:13] if that old denominational husband
[1:09:17] is not dead
[1:09:22] we got two husbands
[1:09:28] just lean a little groundwork
[1:09:33] but they wanted something for themselves
[1:09:34] that they could do
[1:09:36] have their own creeds and denominations
[1:09:38] and what more
[1:09:40] make pharisees sadducees
[1:09:44] i don't know what man doing
[1:09:46] and something they could do their sales
[1:09:49] man is always trying to save himself
[1:09:52] you can't do that god has already done
[1:09:54] it
[1:09:55] you just have to accept it and believe
[1:09:58] it
[1:09:58] but look what he calls now that they
[1:10:00] were doing back dire
[1:10:02] illustrating
[1:10:05] what they were doing
[1:10:07] it comes down to denominationalism
[1:10:10] it comes down to our creeds
[1:10:13] and ideas
[1:10:15] it comes down to the pharisees and the
[1:10:16] sadducees
[1:10:21] you know the pharisees and sadducees
[1:10:23] come from the group of people
[1:10:26] at exodus 19.
[1:10:34] are you with me
[1:10:38] all right
[1:10:41] on to number five
[1:10:47] oh lord just once more 63 628
[1:10:51] morning service
[1:10:53] grace had provided
[1:10:55] everything they needed off but they
[1:10:58] wanted something
[1:10:59] to do themselves
[1:11:03] little did they know when miriam was
[1:11:05] dancing with the tambourine
[1:11:07] and the children of israel dancing with
[1:11:09] her and moses singing in the spirit
[1:11:13] but there were only 10 days
[1:11:16] from the promised land
[1:11:18] the full promised land
[1:11:19] little did they know 40 years and their
[1:11:22] carcasses would rot in the wilderness
[1:11:27] what did
[1:11:28] it
[1:11:31] what caused that to rot in the
[1:11:32] wilderness
[1:11:34] israel made its most racial
[1:11:36] decision
[1:11:38] it ever made when it accepted law
[1:11:42] instead of grace
[1:11:44] when they wanted to make some bishops
[1:11:49] in something
[1:11:50] of their own
[1:11:53] something they had to do into it
[1:11:56] what do you want bishops for
[1:11:58] god was in their midst leading them what
[1:12:00] do you want bishops for
[1:12:04] i know the bible speaks of bishops
[1:12:08] and bishops right because
[1:12:11] who was it um
[1:12:14] paul to timothy
[1:12:18] you know
[1:12:19] see paul's a bishop
[1:12:22] and he ordained
[1:12:24] elders and bishops
[1:12:27] and they're correct
[1:12:31] but he's relating to israel
[1:12:33] in wanting bishops
[1:12:40] where did nathan and cora come in at
[1:12:44] what would they say
[1:12:47] now moses
[1:12:49] moses
[1:12:51] we're all spiritual
[1:12:53] is that what they said
[1:12:55] you take too much on yourself you're
[1:12:57] just being wore out now
[1:12:59] we're all spiritual
[1:13:02] you know evidently god didn't think too
[1:13:04] much of that
[1:13:07] because the ground swallowed them up
[1:13:14] they wanted to make them some bishops
[1:13:22] i'll say this back up just one little
[1:13:24] word
[1:13:25] you'll see where i'm headed if you don't
[1:13:27] want to listen to the next two or three
[1:13:28] messages that'll be your choice
[1:13:31] what about the bishops of this message
[1:13:41] i've never heard a doctrine yet that
[1:13:42] didn't say if you don't believe our way
[1:13:46] you're lost
[1:13:56] what was it brother
[1:13:58] richard when you and i back there and
[1:14:04] come in the message there in 66 hearing
[1:14:06] of it
[1:14:08] 67
[1:14:10] what was going on then joyce
[1:14:13] oh gary
[1:14:15] maybe all you all were young enough that
[1:14:16] don't remember but there's brother
[1:14:17] howell sitting back there
[1:14:21] we used to get together
[1:14:23] and you know what the topic was
[1:14:26] who's going to lead us now that the
[1:14:28] prophet's gone
[1:14:36] who's the elijah today
[1:14:38] to carry us over
[1:14:44] i remember we were in jeffersonville and
[1:14:45] billy paul came out there
[1:14:47] and he said i just found out who the
[1:14:48] elijah
[1:14:49] it is to take us over
[1:14:52] boy everybody just froze you
[1:14:55] write his name down
[1:14:59] he gave the page number and a paragraph
[1:15:01] and he said brother branham said it was
[1:15:03] the lord jesus christ
[1:15:10] not everybody wanted tonight
[1:15:17] the seven
[1:15:19] thunder doctrine not over into the
[1:15:21] others with it
[1:15:22] great ones
[1:15:23] they had seven men
[1:15:25] written down that was supposed to each
[1:15:27] one be a thunder
[1:15:32] you tell me that organized religion
[1:15:33] ain't here today
[1:15:36] i gotta back up back up
[1:15:40] so you might not want to hear the rest
[1:15:41] of the message
[1:15:44] okay go to number six i think it's right
[1:15:47] in it
[1:15:50] jesus keeps all of his appointments 64
[1:15:52] 418 evening service grace had provided
[1:15:55] them a profit a pill or fire sacrificial
[1:15:57] lamb
[1:15:58] a deliverance
[1:15:59] and still they wanted a law
[1:16:01] they want something they could have
[1:16:03] something to do into they want to put
[1:16:05] their hands to it
[1:16:08] how's that
[1:16:11] that was the most rational
[1:16:13] mistake they ever made in exodus 19 when
[1:16:17] israel rejected grace and accepted law
[1:16:23] and then what did they do
[1:16:29] he just let them stay right there in the
[1:16:31] wilderness
[1:16:34] do we get there
[1:16:35] we've had 40 years running around and
[1:16:38] around
[1:16:39] and around and around
[1:16:44] right
[1:16:46] how long has the prophet been gone 65
[1:16:50] according to that we've had about 40
[1:16:53] 48 close to
[1:16:55] we bump in 50. okay
[1:16:58] he just let them stay there in the
[1:16:59] wilderness for 40 years they flip
[1:17:01] vineyards and ate fruit and they married
[1:17:03] wives and they raised children till that
[1:17:05] old generation died off in another
[1:17:07] generation come on
[1:17:09] 40 years later and not hardly 40 hours
[1:17:12] away but they had to wait for 40 years
[1:17:14] before they went over then a new leader
[1:17:17] came in joshua and they moved on into
[1:17:19] the land with the new group who's to
[1:17:22] joshua this day
[1:17:24] the lord jesus christ
[1:17:27] not you and not me
[1:17:30] it's the lord jesus christ
[1:17:33] all right
[1:17:34] a new group
[1:17:38] look at the next one
[1:17:43] god has a provided way
[1:17:45] 62
[1:17:46] 728.
[1:17:49] little did those egyptian slaves know
[1:17:51] that's israel right when they stood on
[1:17:53] the bank after seeing a great revival
[1:17:56] that that prophet came down and brought
[1:17:58] to them and they sing the mighty land of
[1:18:00] god mighty hand of god
[1:18:03] and they'd been pro protected and come
[1:18:05] out there and dancing in the spirit
[1:18:07] after the cross through the red sea
[1:18:09] and seeing their enemies drown before
[1:18:11] them all their habits and things
[1:18:14] like we'd call today drown behind them
[1:18:18] me and you
[1:18:21] the things that torment them and marry
[1:18:23] him dancing in the spirit moses singing
[1:18:25] in the spirit and so forth little didn't
[1:18:28] know that when they were only about 10
[1:18:30] days from the promised land
[1:18:32] knowing that they were 40 years away
[1:18:35] from it why
[1:18:38] why were they 40 years away
[1:18:40] because they had refused to follow god
[1:18:44] i'd underline that one
[1:18:47] they wanted a law instead of grace
[1:18:50] and they got it
[1:18:51] so they can make their own way and have
[1:18:54] their own so-and-soul man's always tried
[1:18:56] to do something by himself
[1:18:58] and go and let every one of them perish
[1:19:00] in the wilderness and raise up a new
[1:19:02] generation and took them to
[1:19:05] the promised land
[1:19:08] go to the next one
[1:19:10] the suburban church age
[1:19:12] 1960 1206.
[1:19:17] little did they believe
[1:19:19] that the promised land was 40 years
[1:19:21] ahead of them
[1:19:23] if it was only about 40 miles
[1:19:26] but it taken them 40 years to get
[1:19:29] 40 miles
[1:19:31] but it take them
[1:19:33] excuse me but it it'd take them 40 years
[1:19:37] to get
[1:19:38] 40 miles
[1:19:40] is because they chose the wrong thing
[1:19:45] they chose to have a law instead of
[1:19:46] letting the holy spirit lead them the
[1:19:49] pillar of fire taking them on through
[1:19:51] and leading them they wanted to have
[1:19:52] something to do themselves they wanted
[1:19:54] to have certain priests
[1:19:56] and certain dignities
[1:19:58] and a little theology they could fuss
[1:20:00] about
[1:20:06] instead of just going on and letting the
[1:20:08] holy ghost lead them
[1:20:12] they were in the spirit
[1:20:14] god had provided everything but they had
[1:20:17] to have something to do into it
[1:20:20] next
[1:20:21] jehovah jireh
[1:20:24] priest in 64 402
[1:20:27] paragraph 60.
[1:20:28] and in exodus 19th chapter israel made
[1:20:30] one of its most rational things that it
[1:20:32] ever did was when it refused grace
[1:20:36] and accepted law look what grace had
[1:20:38] done grace had furnished for them or
[1:20:40] delivered had furnished for them a
[1:20:41] prophet with a pillar of fire to
[1:20:42] vindicate him with a confirmed word
[1:20:45] was this
[1:20:46] was the sacrificial lamb grace had give
[1:20:49] them a great revival
[1:20:51] grace had brought them through opened up
[1:20:53] the red sea brought them across the
[1:20:55] cross that delivered them with the signs
[1:20:57] and wonders all by grace but they wanted
[1:21:00] something so that they could make
[1:21:01] themselves some big
[1:21:06] names
[1:21:10] uh do you get brother sewing those tapes
[1:21:17] come on
[1:21:19] hard to stay off of that sermon it's
[1:21:20] laying in the office
[1:21:24] of course that's way back there
[1:21:28] uh what'd he say
[1:21:30] now if that just isn't the people today
[1:21:36] it's just the same thing they got to be
[1:21:38] man has got to get him get himself
[1:21:41] involved in it somewhere
[1:21:45] and there is word that israel made its
[1:21:47] great mistake
[1:21:49] when it rejected grace and took law
[1:21:52] instead
[1:21:54] and uh still but the covenant that he
[1:21:56] made with them
[1:21:58] was still
[1:22:00] unconditional
[1:22:04] he never took the covenant away even
[1:22:05] though they'd done the wrong
[1:22:09] it's still the same thing today
[1:22:14] right
[1:22:16] what about it
[1:22:20] okay go ahead number 10.
[1:22:23] returning jubilee i would suggest
[1:22:25] listening to this message
[1:22:26] 1962 11 22
[1:22:31] e46 and e47
[1:22:34] and little did they know that they were
[1:22:36] dancing on the banks of the jordan
[1:22:39] or the dead sea and that they were 40
[1:22:41] years away from the land
[1:22:44] they was only about five days away but
[1:22:47] they made their rational mistake in
[1:22:49] exodus the 19th chapter when they
[1:22:51] accepted law instead of grace where they
[1:22:54] turned down god's way to have a way for
[1:22:57] themselves
[1:23:01] give us something to do
[1:23:07] that's been man's idea
[1:23:10] all along
[1:23:13] right
[1:23:15] now remember it's been man's idea
[1:23:19] that's the nature of man
[1:23:22] adam expressed that in the garden of
[1:23:24] eden when he was lost
[1:23:27] instead of going back to god for grace
[1:23:32] you
[1:23:32] remember i said that one ago
[1:23:36] he tried to make himself an apron
[1:23:38] and ever since then he's tried to have
[1:23:40] something to do with redemption
[1:23:45] when redemption is a free offer of grace
[1:23:48] by god god alone there's nothing you can
[1:23:50] do to save yourself
[1:23:52] god saved you no way at all you can do
[1:23:55] it
[1:23:56] but man wants something to do into it
[1:24:02] look at number 11.
[1:24:06] i'll get two more then we'll quit
[1:24:09] this is
[1:24:10] taking the message
[1:24:11] uh demonology religious realm
[1:24:15] 53 809 a
[1:24:18] god made a covenant with man and man
[1:24:20] breaks his covenant every time
[1:24:23] man never did he's keep his covenant
[1:24:25] with god
[1:24:28] the law
[1:24:29] was never kept
[1:24:35] now if that was what they wanted
[1:24:37] and he gave it to him they still didn't
[1:24:39] keep it
[1:24:41] so it's a condemnation
[1:24:44] they couldn't keep the law
[1:24:47] now here's i have to explain this
[1:24:48] wording right here christ was come and
[1:24:50] broke the law himself
[1:24:52] oh the people look at that christ broke
[1:24:54] the law
[1:24:55] i want you to explain that when he was
[1:24:56] almighty god
[1:24:59] what do you mean prophet said he broke
[1:25:01] the law
[1:25:02] explain it
[1:25:05] how did christ break the law
[1:25:08] when he was a man that gave the law when
[1:25:10] he was the law
[1:25:16] come on
[1:25:21] the law
[1:25:24] say it
[1:25:26] every person
[1:25:28] that was born in the world
[1:25:33] by sex
[1:25:35] was condemned to death
[1:25:39] you agree with that
[1:25:41] you want scripture for it
[1:25:44] all the sin comes short of the glory of
[1:25:45] god
[1:25:46] all condemned to death
[1:25:48] but you see jesus step right across
[1:25:51] human being
[1:25:52] not born by sex
[1:25:54] except into a body
[1:25:57] gave his life
[1:25:59] and stopped that law
[1:26:04] right
[1:26:05] he broke it what not broke it like broke
[1:26:08] it
[1:26:09] he stopped its effect
[1:26:12] christ is the end of the law for
[1:26:13] righteousness them that believe
[1:26:16] he never done nothing wrong in his own
[1:26:18] law
[1:26:20] you hear somebody say that tell that
[1:26:21] smart alec to come on the little and
[1:26:23] let's talk
[1:26:27] come on
[1:26:30] he didn't break that law like break it
[1:26:36] he fulfilled it
[1:26:40] and by fulfilling it
[1:26:42] it totally annihilated the law that says
[1:26:44] you got to die
[1:26:47] right
[1:26:49] the law said you had to die paul said
[1:26:52] what i thought was like was death
[1:26:57] but jesus christ made a way
[1:27:00] that he stopped that word from being
[1:27:02] able to fulfill and we can just step
[1:27:04] right across out of this
[1:27:06] because he's already done it in your
[1:27:07] soul by the new birth come on
[1:27:11] but you see
[1:27:14] people want to get tied up and
[1:27:17] they couldn't keep the law
[1:27:19] christ was come and broke the law
[1:27:20] himself
[1:27:22] because god had already promised a
[1:27:23] savior
[1:27:25] that's how he broke the law
[1:27:27] moses provided a way of escape
[1:27:29] and then escape rather and then the
[1:27:31] people after that they still wanted
[1:27:33] something to do man they're always
[1:27:34] trying to do something to save himself
[1:27:36] when you can't do it
[1:27:38] watch it's his nature
[1:27:41] as soon as he found out he was naked in
[1:27:44] the garden of eden
[1:27:45] he made some fig aprons is that right
[1:27:48] but he found out that they wouldn't work
[1:27:51] nothing a man can do can serve
[1:27:53] can serve your
[1:27:55] nothing a man can do can serve yourself
[1:27:59] god say save yourself excuse me
[1:28:02] he's god saves you
[1:28:04] unconditionally
[1:28:06] all down through the age
[1:28:10] and what is it
[1:28:12] and when you're saved what is it
[1:28:15] you're saved by grace
[1:28:20] it's still unconditional
[1:28:22] what's the last one
[1:28:25] excuse me my past 12 go to 13.
[1:28:29] okay
[1:28:32] all right
[1:28:33] now he didn't underline these because i
[1:28:35] didn't give them to him to late but this
[1:28:37] is amazing here he him 1956
[1:28:39] uh 9 30.
[1:28:41] uh e 34
[1:28:44] and 35.
[1:28:47] look where we at
[1:28:51] yeah he got it come on he got it he's
[1:28:53] well hit up
[1:28:54] look moses represented the law
[1:28:56] no man can keep the law the law was
[1:28:58] given to israel because they required it
[1:29:04] in exodus 19 was the greatest mistake
[1:29:07] that israel ever made after grace had
[1:29:09] provided a lamb provided a savior and
[1:29:11] they said give us something to do
[1:29:13] that's the way of man
[1:29:15] that's the way men try to do today is to
[1:29:17] merit their salvation
[1:29:22] see you as probably did it at and
[1:29:24] whether i was right or not when i was
[1:29:26] saying they was trying their best to
[1:29:28] find a way of salvation in the beginning
[1:29:30] without it being by the grace they
[1:29:32] wanted some rules that would make them
[1:29:34] righteous enough to be saved
[1:29:36] you probably wondered so we just read it
[1:29:41] and after grace had provided a lamb
[1:29:45] provided a savior and they said give us
[1:29:46] something to do
[1:29:48] that's the way men try to do today
[1:29:51] is to merit their salvation
[1:29:53] there's not one thing
[1:29:55] you can do about it it's all amazing
[1:29:58] grace oh i love it
[1:30:00] nobody you can not by works but by grace
[1:30:03] are you saved that unmerited grace god
[1:30:06] through the righteousness of the lord
[1:30:08] jesus christ has saved you and called
[1:30:10] you by his own grace
[1:30:13] our moses
[1:30:15] represented the law
[1:30:17] he's talking about on transfiguration
[1:30:20] right now
[1:30:21] no man is saved by the works of the law
[1:30:25] but yet peter wanted to build a
[1:30:26] denomination
[1:30:28] you probably thought i
[1:30:30] didn't have a quote
[1:30:31] when i said while ago that peter said
[1:30:33] we'll build the denominations
[1:30:36] come on that's what your prophet said
[1:30:39] but yet peter wanted to build a
[1:30:40] denomination around him he said we'll
[1:30:42] just build three tabernacles
[1:30:44] we'll be one for moses
[1:30:47] let those who want to keep the law
[1:30:50] keep the law
[1:30:52] that's all right
[1:30:54] let them keep the law
[1:30:55] he said we'll build one for elijah
[1:30:57] and elijah represented not the law but
[1:30:59] you're representing god's purity his
[1:31:01] holiness his judgment
[1:31:03] god
[1:31:04] i mean excuse me elijah representing
[1:31:06] god's righteousness
[1:31:08] for his stern righteousness listen
[1:31:11] for where the elijah
[1:31:13] they said to him fifties
[1:31:15] and he caught fire down out of heaven
[1:31:17] and burnt them up
[1:31:19] he must be
[1:31:21] so we don't want god's judgment
[1:31:25] we don't want god's law
[1:31:30] the one i gave you this morning was
[1:31:32] number 12 that we didn't get
[1:31:35] i read around and said one goes to
[1:31:36] church
[1:31:40] he said i do this
[1:31:42] he said the other one goes to church
[1:31:44] it says because of the love in my heart
[1:31:47] is why i'm there
[1:31:49] that's the difference in law and grace
[1:31:52] i hope you follow what i'm trying to say
[1:31:56] man wanted something to do because he's
[1:31:58] always wanted something to do with his
[1:32:00] salvation
[1:32:02] and he's always wanted some
[1:32:04] brother
[1:32:07] i know the lord called me because
[1:32:09] i never did drink and gamble and smoke
[1:32:12] like the rest of y'all
[1:32:23] see if i'd even said that i'd say i
[1:32:24] doubt that because god don't go along
[1:32:27] like that
[1:32:31] grace
[1:32:33] is god's word
[1:32:35] revealed
[1:32:37] works
[1:32:38] or law
[1:32:41] there was nothing wrong with the law
[1:32:44] we're going to get to that
[1:32:46] it was spiritual
[1:32:50] but it was the way man
[1:32:52] wanted so they didn't get what they
[1:32:55] wanted
[1:32:57] they didn't get thy shalt not steal thou
[1:33:00] shalt not kill
[1:33:05] come on
[1:33:07] are you listening
[1:33:09] read the ten commandments
[1:33:11] show me one of them commandments is
[1:33:13] talking about something you do or don't
[1:33:15] do
[1:33:16] other than honor your father and your
[1:33:18] mother or something
[1:33:23] and remember there is one scripture you
[1:33:25] better deal with
[1:33:28] they asked jesus what was the greatest
[1:33:31] of the commandments
[1:33:38] there is no commandment
[1:33:42] it says love god with all your heart
[1:33:44] your soul your mind
[1:33:46] that is not one of the ten commandments
[1:33:50] i'm sorry
[1:33:54] that was jesus's interpolating
[1:33:57] or under giving understanding
[1:34:00] as to what the first commandment was
[1:34:03] the first commandment is what
[1:34:05] you'll have no other gods
[1:34:08] right
[1:34:10] what is the jesus said was the greatest
[1:34:12] commandment
[1:34:15] thou shalt love the lord thy god
[1:34:18] all my soul
[1:34:20] mind and being or what it was because
[1:34:23] john goes one peter go
[1:34:26] luke goes with
[1:34:30] another the greatest commandment
[1:34:35] is to love god for what he done for you
[1:34:37] and i
[1:34:40] because if you love him you ain't gonna
[1:34:41] have no more gods
[1:34:44] well i need another god another husband
[1:34:46] another idea or another thought come on
[1:34:47] brother
[1:34:48] sorry it took a little bit too long
[1:34:55] but church i'm trying to point down to
[1:34:56] where we're at
[1:34:58] but what they were back there is only
[1:35:01] signs and wonders examples
[1:35:03] and thoughts
[1:35:04] that's why i asked the question
[1:35:07] do we want law or do we want grace
[1:35:10] now i want to ask it this way or do we
[1:35:12] want law and call it
[1:35:15] grace
[1:35:22] well natural no we don't want no law
[1:35:30] we want grace
[1:35:37] and yet we want bishops and elders and
[1:35:39] leaders and
[1:35:47] now restate something i said this
[1:35:49] morning i hope you'll burn deep in your
[1:35:51] mind
[1:35:54] before the law came into existence with
[1:35:56] moses you already had the atonements
[1:35:59] being made the sacrifices was taking
[1:36:02] place there is no unconditional covenant
[1:36:04] without a sacrifice
[1:36:10] they were already doing it
[1:36:12] but they were doing it
[1:36:14] one at a time
[1:36:18] when the law came it kind of bundled it
[1:36:20] over
[1:36:21] into a group
[1:36:26] everybody had to take that land
[1:36:29] and everybody had to kill that lamb
[1:36:34] right
[1:36:40] see with man then came priest
[1:36:44] and high priest
[1:36:49] which would speak of christ yes
[1:36:54] but it was trying to tie man to flesh
[1:37:00] if anybody's ever thought here that
[1:37:01] brother dale had ever tried to tie you
[1:37:03] to his flesh
[1:37:04] or his ways or his thoughts or whatever
[1:37:07] you sure miss me a whole lot
[1:37:11] i've tried to get us for salvation for
[1:37:14] god to speak to you
[1:37:16] individually
[1:37:20] not to speak to me for you that's fine
[1:37:25] but if i speak to you sister gail you
[1:37:27] got to figure out whether that was god
[1:37:28] or me
[1:37:30] so if he speaks to you you don't have to
[1:37:32] worry about who it was
[1:37:35] right
[1:37:37] he speaks to you there's no question
[1:37:40] i want him to speak to you
[1:37:46] well yeah we got in the message and we
[1:37:47] got people see that would just speak the
[1:37:49] word
[1:37:53] well i'm gonna try it
[1:37:55] there ain't no such thing as trying it
[1:37:59] right
[1:38:02] it's whether god spoke to you or not
[1:38:07] and that's why that i do a lot of times
[1:38:09] i'm sorry
[1:38:10] because i don't want something built on
[1:38:12] this man in his ways
[1:38:16] so i back up a lot of times when god
[1:38:18] will speak to me about something i don't
[1:38:20] tell it
[1:38:21] why because i don't want you coming
[1:38:23] brother dale
[1:38:24] did the lord tell anything tell you
[1:38:26] anything if he does i'll tell you
[1:38:30] if i think you need it
[1:38:35] if you don't i'll just pray for you
[1:38:38] i'll pray that he speaks to you
[1:38:43] if he can speak to me and tell me your
[1:38:45] needs why can't he speak to you and tell
[1:38:47] your needs
[1:38:49] then it ain't no go-between of a priest
[1:38:51] or a bishop or something
[1:38:58] go ahead brother what we got understand
[1:39:02] i just want you to see jesus christ
[1:39:05] in your own experience
[1:39:32] until
[1:39:42] your soul amen
[1:39:46] holy jesus
[1:39:49] that is by
[1:39:52] yourself
[1:40:06] you
[1:40:08] you never knew
[1:40:10] sweet love and joy
[1:40:15] your only jesus
[1:40:18] is that is
[1:40:22] many of you remember this experience
[1:40:24] that i'm going to tell
[1:40:27] years ago we remember wade he
[1:40:32] started coming back to the lord
[1:40:34] lord was dealing with him
[1:40:38] and we'd always we had a little cabin up
[1:40:40] in the mountains and your regular cell
[1:40:41] phone would work there but others
[1:40:43] wouldn't work you know so we cured our
[1:40:44] cell phone
[1:40:46] we'd always take it with us in case the
[1:40:47] kids needed us and stepped a day or two
[1:40:49] and work
[1:40:51] and one day i left it out in the car
[1:40:54] i always carried on my side i was left
[1:40:56] in the car for some reason
[1:40:58] that was the day wade thought he was
[1:40:59] having a heart attack and from every
[1:41:01] form that he described it looked like it
[1:41:04] but yet he was trying to get a hold of
[1:41:05] daddy and mama
[1:41:08] that's good
[1:41:11] because he didn't he didn't need that in
[1:41:12] mama
[1:41:17] if he just called me i'd have been there
[1:41:19] to have as quick as i could have drove
[1:41:20] it wide open getting there right
[1:41:23] prayed for him all the way
[1:41:25] but instead
[1:41:27] he walked outside there at work and he
