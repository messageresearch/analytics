[13:26] turn straight to the word of god amen
[13:28] and i just got two little scriptures to
[13:30] read to you
[13:32] amen and the morning service obviously
[13:34] is always a little bit different than
[13:37] the afternoon service
[13:39] but um
[13:40] praise the lord if you turn in your
[13:41] bible to job and we're going to get it
[13:43] in job 32
[13:45] if you've read the book of job you'll
[13:47] realize he's a man that you highly
[13:49] respect
[13:50] amen a man of unempowered integrity and
[13:53] honesty
[13:54] and so we'll just just go into chapter
[13:57] 32 there to get that and i'll be with
[13:58] you in a minute praise the lord my wife
[14:00] got me a new bible and still the new
[14:03] pages are there and it takes me a little
[14:05] bit longer amen but it's just one verse
[14:08] in chapter 32 and verse 8 and we can
[14:10] read it together today
[14:12] amen where it says but there is a spirit
[14:16] in mind
[14:17] and the inspiration of the almighty
[14:20] giveth him understanding
[14:22] there is a spirit of mind
[14:24] on the inspiration
[14:26] of the almighty it has to be that
[14:29] will give him
[14:31] understanding amen and of course as we
[14:33] know we can get right into uh uh to
[14:36] timothy amen uh in the second book which
[14:40] which we know so well
[14:41] amen chapter
[14:43] on verse 16 where timothy where paul
[14:46] says these these these lovely words amen
[14:49] praise the lord
[14:51] amen he says and from a child
[14:54] that has known the holy scriptures which
[14:56] are able to make the wise under
[14:58] salvation through faith which is in
[15:00] christ jesus
[15:02] all scripture is given by inspiration of
[15:04] god and is profitable for doctrine for
[15:07] reproof for correction and for
[15:10] instruction and righteousness that the
[15:12] man of god may be perfect thoroughly
[15:15] furnished onto every good work amen lord
[15:18] jesus
[15:19] we certainly know
[15:21] as the prophet of god in our day said
[15:22] lord that any man
[15:24] in this nation could open this book
[15:26] today but lord accept you reveal what's
[15:29] in here lord it would be just words and
[15:31] letters lord to them
[15:33] so father god we thank you we're a
[15:34] people
[15:35] that you've revealed your word to in
[15:37] this last day
[15:39] and we just pray lord for
[15:41] this hour lord and father
[15:44] that you will just come and help us lord
[15:47] after we've had so much fellowship
[15:50] lovely fellowship today lord
[15:52] together and around the luncheon and we
[15:54] just pray now lord that you'll bless us
[15:56] and strengthen us all and lord to
[15:58] receive the last little portion for the
[16:00] day and that you will bless your word to
[16:02] every heart in jesus christ's name we
[16:04] ask it amen
[16:06] praise the lord god bless you may be
[16:07] seated and um
[16:10] praise the lord amen now that's why i
[16:12] read out uh today
[16:14] that we come to church to be inspired
[16:18] amen right praise the lord but don't
[16:20] don't lay at all on the preacher amen
[16:22] praise the lord but the word of god
[16:24] should inspire you amen and when you
[16:27] read these stories they are real stories
[16:30] they happen to real people
[16:31] and we want to uh to get in on that
[16:35] there amen and you know when we've come
[16:38] to be inspired and uh praise the lord
[16:41] inspiration just this word it just means
[16:44] god breathed
[16:45] god breathed so if you are inspired it
[16:48] means that god will be breathing on you
[16:50] and he'll breathe on you hallelujah and
[16:53] you'll have the breath of god you know
[16:55] we have a hymn i i don't know maybe but
[16:58] it's an old old hymn and it's breathe on
[17:01] me breath of god and that's exactly
[17:03] right this morning that would be uh this
[17:06] afternoon uh that would be our desire uh
[17:09] the inspiration of god and his word it's
[17:12] just what i felt to human here this
[17:14] afternoon amen and that's what i want to
[17:17] look at the inspiration of god and his
[17:19] word because his word is inspiring
[17:21] hallelujah uh what it has there's many
[17:24] things have inspired people but nothing
[17:26] will inspire you like the word of god
[17:29] should do amen and it's wonderful and
[17:32] the prophet says and when the
[17:33] inspiration of the holy spirit is here
[17:36] to inspire you remember
[17:38] god will make your body come into your
[17:42] confession
[17:43] so there's so much praise the lord today
[17:46] that's to do with our confession
[17:48] and i've always had a little uh a quote
[17:50] myself where if you say it can't be done
[17:55] it certainly will not be done a minute
[17:57] the mirror you know folks you you really
[18:00] uh you're touching the subject in my
[18:02] heart amen when even when my wife and
[18:06] i'm told that she'll not last to the
[18:08] next morning she's going to be dead by
[18:10] the morning light amen and if i give in
[18:13] to that if i confess that brother i tell
[18:16] you what and all i could say was god has
[18:19] not revealed that to me he said that for
[18:21] me so she's not here in the morning the
[18:23] lord never told me amen and i remember
[18:27] in church that morning i knew she was
[18:29] still living and in the church that
[18:31] morning we used a text of uh
[18:34] of uh this confession amen whatever you
[18:37] confess amen i'm not only that there but
[18:41] uh uh
[18:42] with god when brother branham used that
[18:45] little story about the girl over in
[18:47] sweden and uh
[18:50] he he showed that
[18:52] his brother said him look brother bill
[18:53] come on you've done enough tonight quit
[18:55] now
[18:56] and he looked round and he said no just
[18:59] one more amen the sovereignty of god
[19:02] the sovereignty of god in our lives
[19:04] friends it's so wonderful praise the
[19:06] lord that god let you you could have
[19:09] come as for uh samuel said this morning
[19:12] you could have come a number of ways to
[19:13] church in your in your car today you
[19:15] know but god will give you that free
[19:17] will to do that amen but to see him over
[19:20] above that amen that he's working all
[19:22] things together and uh wow i i tell you
[19:26] what that little girl you know uh so
[19:29] here was a tired prophet i just want
[19:32] more and then he heard that little knock
[19:34] coming across i said come on our little
[19:36] calipers you know and he looked at that
[19:38] little child he said honey you don't

[19:45] showed me that's what the vision said
[19:47] sister larson take over and you see the
[19:49] little girl with her blonde hair and
[19:51] holding up the calipers you know that's
[19:52] the god that we worship today that's the
[19:55] god that that is here to inspire us amen
[19:57] and to bring your body into confession
[20:00] amen and i mean it hallelujah i'm not

[20:43] anything negative amen i said i'm going
[20:45] to stand here positive hallelujah amen
[20:49] and that's the way we ought to do it
[20:50] because our people praise god you know
[20:52] and uh let god reveal it to you he'll
[20:55] take care of it amen that's what he said
[20:57] what you confess
[20:58] and if you confess so i'm always tired
[21:00] you'll be tired you know but let's
[21:02] confess that well god strengthened me
[21:05] amen god strengthened me god
[21:06] strengthened me and see what happens
[21:08] there you know it's just wonderful
[21:09] hallelujah and appraisal i'll just
[21:12] remember that because we've got a high
[21:14] priest of our confession he can only be
[21:16] what we say he is in our life
[21:18] amen that's the truth you know and uh
[21:21] praise god uh really and truly you know
[21:23] we're a people that have got clean minds
[21:25] hey man we don't need to look at filth
[21:27] and nonsense amen because that's what he
[21:29] is that's the high priest he is of our
[21:31] confession hallelujah i don't want to
[21:33] see nothing like that i just want to
[21:35] keep my eyes blinked hallelujah and see
[21:38] what god wants me to see so it's
[21:40] wonderful amen and he said remember have
[21:43] faith don't we ever stand on it that's
[21:45] it we're the standing people and stand
[21:47] and don't wait for we don't have to do
[21:49] that amen well i'll say a few things as
[21:51] we go on in the message you know uh
[21:53] brother branham says all right frankly
[21:55] says we're all pilgrims and we're all
[21:57] strangers here on the earth we're
[21:59] seeking a city to come whose builder and
[22:01] maker is god amen so that is the truth
[22:04] praise the lord talking to one of the
[22:05] sisters
[22:06] today at the lunch you know and that is
[22:09] the truth that's what we're looking for
[22:10] amen and we're looking for this great
[22:12] millennial rein amen we certainly are
[22:14] hallelujah it's not a a pie in the sky
[22:17] when you die thing that's a reality
[22:19] brother amen that's a reality all the
[22:22] sins of god have have told us that this
[22:24] word has told us that from the beginning
[22:26] to the end and we believe it that's the
[22:28] difference and it's going to be that way
[22:30] and i remember even when
[22:33] when jacob came before uh pharaoh you
[22:36] know and uh of course uh joseph joseph
[22:39] was perfection but brother brother said
[22:41] he had a little script on there you know
[22:44] he just you know a little scratch there
[22:46] because he said to his daddy he said now
[22:49] don't tell them you're shepherds
[22:51] amen he didn't want that you know the
[22:53] egyptians don't like shepherds so don't
[22:55] tell them you're shepherds amen and that
[22:57] said praise the lord don't tell someone
[22:59] there that you go to an end time church
[23:01] why
[23:02] but why amen preschool what am i ashamed
[23:05] of hallelujah praise god i don't care i
[23:08] said to my people i wouldn't care of
[23:10] them the pope was there all the
[23:11] cardinals was there and all the bishops
[23:13] were there said don't go in there amen
[23:16] it wouldn't bother me friends because i
[23:18] tell you i know who i am i know what
[23:19] i've got i know where i'm going and
[23:21] that's the way it is bless the lord so
[23:24] he come in that's right brother samuel
[23:26] and he came in he came into uh he came
[23:29] into pharaoh and of course pharaoh says
[23:32] there would have been a young man and he
[23:34] says to him he said oh he said you know
[23:37] he's an old man here and uh he said what
[23:39] is your year i think he said 110 120 or
[23:41] whatever it was and uh he said yes and
[23:44] what do you do he said i'm a shepherd
[23:46] amen and joseph must have been said oh
[23:47] what did he say that for
[23:49] you know but that said because it was
[23:51] the truth that's what he was and and he
[23:54] said what are you and he said the years
[23:56] of my pilgrimage
[23:58] he admitted to pharaoh that i'm just a
[24:01] pilgrim and a stranger here and i'm
[24:03] seeking a city to come said how do you
[24:06] know that because he said that joseph
[24:08] you swear by the lord god almighty that
[24:10] you'll not bury me down in egypt you get
[24:12] me right up there hallelujah to die and
[24:14] be buried with my grandfather and my
[24:16] father amen because there's going to be
[24:19] a resurrection one day and i'm going to
[24:21] be in it amen
[24:23] well you say oh praise the lord so that
[24:25] means i should get to the undertaker and
[24:26] say how much would it cost
[24:28] to get me transported over to jerusalem
[24:32] we don't have to worry about that
[24:33] friends because i'll tell you why
[24:35] because brother branham said let me be
[24:37] buried in christ just let me be buried
[24:40] if i am there one day that voice will
[24:42] speak hallelujah and i'll tell you it
[24:44] says we'll hear it amen and we will come
[24:46] forth out of the grave wonderful and so
[24:49] they were seeking a city to come you
[24:51] know and and you see he never found it
[24:54] he never found it amen
[24:56] and uh
[24:58] though he looked and you know sometimes
[24:59] the bible says
[25:01] they died not having they received the
[25:03] promise but not seeing the fulfillment
[25:04] of the promises and yet of all here we
[25:07] are and we've got you see
[25:09] we have to remember that that abraham
[25:12] didn't have the book of revelation you
[25:14] know but we've got the book of
[25:15] revelation and i think i told you last
[25:17] year i made it but i certainly heard it
[25:19] that uh and i believe it so much that i
[25:21] checked it out in the book shop
[25:23] that the catholic church want to take
[25:25] out the book of revelation
[25:27] out of their bible amen that's just too
[25:30] much for them so the best thing to do is
[25:32] what they always do take it out would
[25:34] anybody notice absolutely not why
[25:36] because the priest has never preached
[25:38] from the book of revelation in his life
[25:39] he's never read from the book of
[25:40] revelation in his life and that's the
[25:42] way it is you see so praise god but it's
[25:45] our book hallelujah it's our book and
[25:48] john saw it john saw what abraham did
[25:50] not see he saw the city hallelujah and
[25:53] he was all represented of amen i tell
[25:56] you friends if i say this if you
[25:58] remember nothing else just remember that
[26:00] you go into your computer you'll find it
[26:02] where brother brown says one man can rap
[26:04] us out of whole people and you look at
[26:06] john being our representative amen being
[26:08] there what he saw from from even when he
[26:11] opens the gospel where does he start he
[26:13] starts with the eternal god and the
[26:15] beginning was the word he doesn't start
[26:18] at bethlehem manger he starts right at
[26:20] the beginning hallelujah and that's why
[26:22] because the bread is he's a
[26:24] representative of is what he saw
[26:27] hallelujah and get your priorities right
[26:29] amen and that was the first event and
[26:31] then he says the word became flesh amen

[28:34] ambassador i said i wish
[28:38] with all my heart i wish i could say to
[28:40] you all is well
[28:42] you've reached the spot as peace
[28:44] forevermore i said but i'm sorry it
[28:46] doesn't say that in your bible it does
[28:49] not it says every nation will come
[28:51] against you
[28:52] don't forget it it's thus saith the lord
[28:55] amen he said you know more about it than
[28:57] i do i said i'm only quoting your bible
[29:01] but every nation will surround jerusalem

[29:05] my goodness but he will come dying your
[29:08] messiah will come down and place his
[29:09] feet on the mount of olives hallelujah

[29:22] saw the great amen and i don't
[29:25] have any at the minute but they brought
[29:27] out a new little uh five-year-old note

[29:36] the lord uh
[29:38] europe and the woman riding the beast
[29:40] it's all there if you can only see it
[29:42] amen praise the lord anyway and that
[29:45] great inspiration of god

[29:50] branham speaking tells us that the home
[29:53] is just beyond the gloom amen where we
[29:56] all go it's there somewhere you know

[31:11] great inspiration tells us
[31:13] now you know thank god we were singing
[31:16] today
[31:17] what would the church be like if we
[31:18] didn't sing right you know i mean what
[31:20] would the church i know back home or
[31:21] certain people don't believe in music
[31:23] and they well they believe in singing
[31:25] but it's all you know top top and
[31:28] somebody leads them off and i can't or
[31:29] whatever not i don't know music amen and
[31:33] i just wonder what bible they read amen
[31:35] when you read in the old testament about
[31:37] god amen and about leading the army out
[31:40] and everybody playing and certain and
[31:42] singing and praising god
[31:44] i don't know what bible they're at i say
[31:46] oh that's the old testament
[31:48] amen but i tell you what not all that is
[31:51] within me praise his holy name i only
[31:53] wish i'd had a thousand times to praise
[31:55] the lord i only wish that i i could go
[31:57] back to 21 again and say yeah i've got
[31:59] another 40 years to serve the lord i'd
[32:01] love that amen praise god it's wonderful
[32:03] amen and the inspirations and the songs
[32:06] we sing this is all you
[32:08] anything that you want in this message
[32:10] you just tap it in and you'll get it on
[32:12] your computer amen the famous uh poet
[32:14] william kuiper you know the song that he
[32:16] wrote amen brother brother said i stood
[32:18] out his grave a few months ago i just
[32:20] couldn't help shedding a few tears for
[32:22] that man amen there's a prophet amen
[32:25] shedding tears for william kuiper had
[32:27] been dead 100 more years
[32:29] and uh praise the lord uh he was
[32:31] considered in england a neurotic you
[32:33] know a little nervous you know and
[32:35] preachers are a little bit nervous you
[32:37] know they're nervous to be around and
[32:39] and so uh here he was and and hari would
[32:42] go under inspiration and finally he went
[32:45] into the inspiration and wrote that
[32:47] lovely song there is a fountain filled
[32:50] with blood
[32:51] why would inspiration something struck
[32:53] that man when he penned them words and
[32:55] we've got them and he doesn't know that
[32:57] they've been sang all over the world
[33:00] hallelujah people have signed students
[33:02] song that song there is a fern and drawn
[33:05] from emmanuel's vegans drawn to the
[33:07] blood of god amen and sinners plunged
[33:10] beneath that fund you know maybe there's
[33:12] some of our young people here never
[33:14] really trusted the lord for salvation
[33:17] but sinners anybody can plunge beneath
[33:19] that blood and lose their guilty stings
[33:21] it's clorox didn't do this it'll wash
[33:24] away all them stains amen of course
[33:27] there's times like we know in the life
[33:29] of elijah he stood there even mocked the
[33:32] prophets of baal
[33:33] you know that and uh and yet after that
[33:36] when the inspiration lifted off him then
[33:39] he heard jezebel's going to kill me he
[33:41] fled he fled but you know it's a lovely
[33:43] story and i'm not going into today so i
[33:45] hear was this man writing that amen
[33:48] tried to commit suicide and everything
[33:50] couldn't find the river because of the
[33:51] fog so you see so god is in her ways and
[33:54] you know just more that's wonderful
[33:56] praise the lord and uh look what he says
[33:58] brother branham says uh harry eddy
[34:00] paranot uh when he was persecuted in
[34:03] everything and what he thought he wrote
[34:05] amen
[34:07] ah when the inspiration hit him he
[34:09] picked up his pen and wrote that a
[34:11] lovely inauguration song all heal the
[34:14] power of jesus name that's a great name
[34:17] why you say why because he says in my
[34:20] name you shall cast it devils
[34:23] hallelujah i've done it hallelujah and
[34:25] my name shall you lay hands on the sick
[34:27] and they shall recover and my name
[34:30] hallelujah that's what it is there's the
[34:32] power that's the devil knows that amen
[34:34] and if you get the faith to use the
[34:36] power then you're in business with god
[34:38] amen absolutely that's the currency of
[34:41] heaven amen sure it is amen oh my i look
[34:44] at john newton what he wrote amazing
[34:45] grace
[34:46] how sweet the sun
[34:48] you know uh they say that it was
[34:50] shipwrecked near ireland near off their
[34:52] east coast
[34:53] up at los swelle it's a beautiful lock
[34:56] but when you get out to the mouth of it
[34:57] that's where their ship went down and
[34:59] apparently you know when people hit you
[35:02] uh they just let you go
[35:04] so when he fell overboard he was kind of
[35:06] thinking well maybe i'll
[35:08] get picked up here again you know but
[35:10] somebody threw over some kind of a
[35:11] harpoon or something with a rope on it
[35:13] and he grabbed it and he was pulled up
[35:15] just like when jeremiah i loved jeremiah
[35:18] and when jeremiah was sinking in the
[35:19] mirror he probably thought this is it
[35:21] this is it but dear god that's okay and
[35:25] just as he was thinking
[35:26] this person looked over
[35:28] in the still of the night and he dropped
[35:30] down the rope he said you put that
[35:31] underneath and jeremiah hooked it around
[35:33] and he pulled him out amen see god knows
[35:35] what he's doing no matter if at the end
[35:37] is a martyr and it don't matter amy and
[35:40] god knows what he's doing hallelujah
[35:42] amen an old dear fanny crosby you know
[35:45] praise the lord the prophet talks about
[35:47] her here uh you know uh she may have
[35:49] been a preacher and short hair but she
[35:51] had no eyes to see with and yet she
[35:54] could write them inspirational songs

[36:00] know him amen praise the lord just by
[36:03] the nail prince in his hand if i was
[36:04] still i'd just say let me feel your hand

[40:49] and space you know but so many lovely
[40:51] hymns that are inspired and i'll i'll
[40:53] say a little bit uh more and more in a
[40:55] moment but uh you know i know paul
[40:58] redder when he come to die
[41:00] and maybe they were singing that i'd say
[41:02] that was fine and maybe they were
[41:04] singing near my god today on the titanic
[41:07] you know that was fine
[41:09] but i'll tell you what
[41:11] he's called over to his brother he said
[41:12] come on in here
[41:13] what is it what is it he said look who's
[41:16] dying near you you know
[41:18] you know who's down here me or you you
[41:19] know and he said yeah yeah yeah he said
[41:22] what do you want he said i want you to
[41:24] play some good gospel music fiat flip

[41:28] you sing one of the old good old songs
[41:30] you know and that's that is wonderful
[41:32] praise the lord amen
[41:35] and they did they struck up a good old
[41:36] song amen he felt a lot better after
[41:38] that i can tell you amen okay so you
[41:41] know they're wonderful but what the
[41:43] whole point is inspiration
[41:45] inspiration god wants you you can be
[41:47] inspired by a song a day you read
[41:49] something that just inspires you to go
[41:50] out face the world hallelujah amen and

[41:56] know now god wants you to fulfill this
[41:58] program uh praise the lord there's
[42:00] certain things must happen must be
[42:02] fulfilled and they must be accomplished
[42:04] amen and god the only hands he's got
[42:07] down here is his hands amen our feet are
[42:09] our lips amen the voice of god's in us
[42:12] amen praise the lord not i don't want to
[42:14] get too kind away there because i
[42:15] remember brother ronald and you know
[42:17] sometimes it's hard you're preaching
[42:19] hard like that and you go back to the
[42:21] motel you can't sleep
[42:24] he said brother if i could preach the
[42:26] word he said i speak the word he said i
[42:28] speak myself asleep
[42:29] so you know just just check it out
[42:32] just check it out the next time you're
[42:33] all filled with it oh yeah well if you
[42:35] can't sleep just speak to yourself and
[42:37] see if you can speak the word or not
[42:40] okay see because you got to balance you
[42:41] got to keep the balance you know i'll
[42:44] say something about that a moment too
[42:45] you know but these things have to be
[42:47] accomplished amen and the prophet said
[42:49] above all things i wouldn't you prosper
[42:51] and be in health see that that the the
[42:54] scriptures writers were inspired by the
[42:56] holy spirit to write that amen and it
[42:58] was given by inspiration uh of god
[43:02] and it says like all scripture that
[43:05] scripture is true
[43:07] so folks i'll tell you what if you said
[43:09] to me do you really believe god wants me
[43:11] to be in health that's the word of god
[43:14] i preached this morning i preached my
[43:15] heart it's telling you that we're to
[43:17] believe every word
[43:18] and it says right here above all things
[43:20] beloved i desire
[43:22] see christians don't have to wish for
[43:23] anything you know i desire that you be
[43:26] in health
[43:27] amen coming straight from the pain of
[43:29] the holy spirit that's his desire that's
[43:32] what we should be walking into by the
[43:34] confession bringing our body into that
[43:36] confession amen no matter what the fight
[43:38] is just keep pressing on into that amen
[43:41] so praise the lord that's what he was
[43:42] and he will fulfill his program amen
[43:44] bless god he always does i love to

[45:22] your sins and accept it you don't need
[45:24] prayer any longer for men you already
[45:27] accepted it it's settled there was a man
[45:29] came to brother branham said brother

[45:33] this church that church this minister
[45:35] that minister

[46:21] sometimes say things happen in your
[46:22] heart
[46:23] and i'll tell you it's not very r and
[46:25] then you go on maybe next week oh lord
[46:27] would you do this but it's already
[46:28] happened as far as he's concerned and
[46:30] that's where the inspiration will come
[46:31] in to show you what's happened and to
[46:34] step out and use your faith praise god
[46:37] and it's wonderful amen and he said when
[46:39] you receive the word hallelujah then
[46:42] what sets it a fire brother when you
[46:44] receive it the revelation something
[46:46] slips out of the unseen
[46:48] the unseen hand amen something slips out
[46:50] of that world amen yonder comes rolling
[46:54] down through that mystical channel
[46:56] somewhere into your soul
[46:58] that's it the word that's the whole
[46:59] thing brother you know the mind and the
[47:01] mental mind is wonderful but when it
[47:03] falls through that right into your soul
[47:05] hallelujah uh brother branham says your
[47:08] eyes will brighten your lips that hung
[47:10] down will straighten up you'll smile
[47:13] every muscle in your body will just
[47:14] rejoice something's happened and you
[47:16] know it hallelujah you don't need the
[47:18] prayer line or nothing in that's fact
[47:20] that's a fact hallelujah praise god and
[47:23] uh amen when you receive the inspiration
[47:25] that jesus died that's the r
[47:27] that came amen praise the lord when you
[47:30] receive the inspiration he's your savior
[47:32] he's your shepherd he's your baptizer in
[47:34] the holy ghost you know your guide your
[47:36] bridegroom
[47:37] that's the hour hallelujah that it comes
[47:40] to you and i'm sure that not one of us
[47:42] here today is sitting here that we can
[47:45] look back and when you come into the
[47:47] bride as it were when you uh in your
[47:49] knowledge said i accept that hallelujah
[47:52] right there it was sealed amen to you
[47:55] amen from god eternal ever seen the way
[47:58] back then and even put your name in it
[48:00] but i tell you now it's sealed to you
[48:03] you know uh when he comes in hallelujah
[48:05] at what point in your life it's all
[48:07] wonderful amen now all scripture is
[48:10] inspired by god all scripture i love
[48:12] that not just some of it as i remember
[48:14] talking to the israeli ambassador's wife
[48:17] and i don't know how we get onto the
[48:18] subject about mo about
[48:20] abraham and sarah and she said moses
[48:23] could have had to be wrong to write that
[48:25] in that a 100 year old man should have a
[48:27] child and a 90 year old woman had to be
[48:29] wrong that that's that's a corruption of
[48:31] the text you know i said really she said
[48:34] well it had to be brother i mean you
[48:35] surely you don't believe that i said
[48:37] well sister surely i do believe it
[48:39] you know
[48:40] amen oh you're wrong man i said no no i
[48:43] said no no i said why could god not have
[48:46] intervened and give them a child why
[48:47] could now we know an old man like that
[48:49] no woman couldn't have a child so god
[48:51] had to do something didn't he and you
[48:53] know god doesn't patch you up some way
[48:55] you know
[48:56] and then and you know what i'm talking
[48:57] about so he had to change them back
[48:59] folks amen and he did change them back
[49:02] and and and she said do you believe that
[49:04] i said your bible tells me that because
[49:06] when they went down to the abimelech he
[49:07] wanted to marry her amen so you see
[49:09] there it is amen and and praise the lord
[49:12] this this is what we believe amen when
[49:14] when you accept that all scripture is
[49:16] inspired of god even that scripture and
[49:18] i said to her if that's wrong how can
[49:20] you have confidence in any part of it
[49:23] see that's the whole point it's not
[49:24] right for the weird that's the whole
[49:26] point you've got to have confidence in
[49:28] everything that you read coming from the
[49:30] mouth of god and believe every word
[49:31] that's one thing about the bride brother
[49:33] samuel absolutely this bride believes it
[49:36] from genesis to revelation hallelujah
[49:38] i've never noticed that i something up
[49:40] here at the back of the church saying if
[49:41] you speak in tongues you've got the
[49:43] baptism of the holy ghost you know we
[49:45] don't put up skidman so let god we
[49:46] believe all the bible hallelujah every
[49:48] last bit of it amen that's the
[49:50] revelation of the word when you get that
[49:52] you'll know you have the holy ghost
[49:54] amen hallelujah i don't know some
[49:56] pentecostals i don't know could you if
[49:59] you'd lived in moody's day that man
[50:01] winning thousands and thousands of souls
[50:03] to christ and say ah mr murder like to
[50:05] talk to you you haven't got the holy
[50:06] ghost
[50:07] that would be real
[50:09] yeah brother dick what do you think hey
[50:11] man
[50:12] you know finney you know you just had a
[50:14] revival you went into a factory every
[50:16] last one of them t-heading and laughing
[50:18] and smirking and you started to pray the
[50:20] next thing is they're all on their knees
[50:22] oh god have mercy on me
[50:23] but he didn't have the holy ghost
[50:25] brother
[50:27] why why is it oh he never spoke in
[50:29] tongues
[50:30] well maybe this bigger things i don't
[50:32] know but i'll tell you one thing see how
[50:33] it goes folks amen now i all scripture
[50:36] amen is given by inspiration you know
[50:39] it's profitable for doctrine i preached
[50:41] on it one sunday morning in the church
[50:44] for doctrine for reproof for correction
[50:46] and for instruction and righteousness
[50:48] and every one of them that's where we
[50:49] get all our doctrine it's in the
[50:51] scriptures hallelujah and it's wonderful
[50:53] amen and that spirit that's in mind
[50:56] we are a spirit you know we don't look
[50:59] i don't care i could i don't know how
[51:01] people could believe that man has not
[51:03] got a spiritual part to him
[51:04] i mean it's so obvious that we have a
[51:06] spiritual part you say well what is that
[51:09] i mean when you were born even as a
[51:10] child nobody's speaking to you you
[51:12] wanted to reach out and touch something
[51:14] greater than yourself
[51:16] amen there was no physical explanation
[51:18] it was just something that was there
[51:20] crying out even as a little child you
[51:22] know i remember
[51:24] playing out like that there and
[51:26] so what was that you know what what was
[51:28] that you know and then i come into the
[51:30] message and brother brother is telling
[51:32] me oh yes your engines were darn run
[51:34] about you that day watching over you as
[51:36] a little child you know
[51:37] certainly hallelujah and that spirit
[51:40] there is a spirit in mind and job was a
[51:42] great man amen and he says praise the
[51:44] lord that is the inspiration of god amen
[51:49] praise the lord gives that man
[51:50] understanding to that spirit that's in
[51:52] him and that's where we are today amen
[51:54] uh jesus said that heaven and earth will
[51:56] pass away as i said this morning uh
[51:59] and his word wouldn't so i'm glad we're
[52:01] you know um sometimes you stand on a
[52:04] building and sometimes you think it's a
[52:06] great building and you come later on to
[52:07] find out the knocked it down so why well
[52:09] because it wasn't structurally signed
[52:11] but you know when you're on something
[52:12] that you can trust but you can put an
[52:14] anchor to your soul hallelujah you can
[52:17] rest your whole eternal destiny on this
[52:19] word of god amen praise the lord and uh
[52:22] you know the prophet said that god will
[52:23] not vindicate a liar
[52:25] think about that one
[52:26] he'll not vindicate a liar praise the
[52:28] lord but his own word he said i tell you
[52:31] the truth this is the truth i am the
[52:33] truth amen i'm not which is according to
[52:35] the facts amen according to the facts
[52:37] that's what truth is praise the lord so
[52:39] let me just go on here and paul was
[52:41] inspired i think we mentioned it a
[52:42] little bit today was inspired to write
[52:44] the new testament moses wrote the old
[52:46] testament and paul right there out in
[52:48] arabia and he wrote and set all these
[52:51] things in order now
[52:54] if i took the book of hebrews out of the
[52:56] new testament
[52:58] if you take it out you've got 13 books
[53:00] by paul and you know god's not glorified
[53:02] in 13. 13 is rebellion amen but 49. so
[53:06] we put the 14th one in there
[53:08] to paul and i'm sure he did write it and
[53:11] you know he took all the types and
[53:13] shadows of the old and brought them
[53:14] right into the new testament amen and
[53:17] praise god uh what a wonderful thing it
[53:19] is to see it all and the people of march
[53:21] see all that there uh and read it and
[53:23] just let it bless your soul amen and he
[53:26] got it three and a half years in arabia
[53:28] he said
[53:29] man didn't teach me it he said i got the
[53:31] old testament i went in there with it
[53:33] and god however he did it the same as
[53:35] brother brought him in the sails every
[53:36] morning how that pillar fire came down
[53:39] and revealed it and the apostle wrote it
[53:41] down and he gave us the book of hebrews
[53:43] now what would you be like if you didn't
[53:44] have that book tell you you'd be really
[53:46] handicapped you'd be really handicapped
[53:48] amen praise the lord amen and uh he said
[53:52] all the old testament shadow he said it
[53:54] all in order he set the whole thing in
[53:56] order and god honored it that's the
[53:58] thing about it amen and we'll talk about
[54:00] brother branham in arizona uh later just
[54:02] about when he was in the desert amen but
[54:06] praise god that bible is revealed by
[54:08] inspiration and praise the lord that's
[54:11] what he told peter
[54:12] upon this rock i'll build my church the
[54:14] rock of inspiration
[54:15] folks you need more than just read it

[55:05] and uh and uh here he starts the lord's
[55:07] prayer i've had a resort in our
[55:08] neighborhood hey man and he was gone
[55:12] that's what he thought about it you know
[55:14] there's some inspiration there wasn't

[55:18] closing word for the families right
[55:19] there wouldn't it yeah but he's an old
[55:21] man and you know

[55:43] and he revealed what you are
[55:45] and you came in hallelujah upon what
[55:48] upon what you saw
[55:50] amen about what you saw he was and
[55:52] that's where he's built this church from
[55:53] the day one you know i've often told
[55:55] people we had a a catholic girl come in
[55:57] there uh her sister i baptized and she
[56:01] got her to church
[56:03] this uh her other sister she got her to
[56:04] church and uh
[56:06] you know when we were we we preached
[56:08] about jesus uh the unwelcome christ uh
[56:10] that morning mostly that she could uh
[56:13] hear something that she could relate to
[56:15] amen and she loved the service she loved
[56:18] the simplicity of it and i was telling
[56:20] her i said you know if you go back on
[56:22] the records
[56:23] and see how they had church i said this
[56:25] is how they did it
[56:27] this is how they did it they would have
[56:28] had a song so therefore they're doing
[56:30] the song leader and you know that
[56:32] whatever way they're saying turn in the
[56:34] catacombs or whatever and then the press
[56:36] butter would come up later and he would
[56:38] preach the word of god to them that's
[56:40] never changed
[56:41] amen when they were going to have a
[56:42] baptism or service there's the water and
[56:45] came the candidate brother justice
[56:47] whatever you know i or pastor whatever
[56:49] i'm going to baptize you today in the
[56:51] name of the lord jesus christ on
[56:53] confession of your faith that's the way
[56:55] they did it the same as we do it so
[56:57] we've all been built on the same rock of
[56:59] revelation yes we have amen it's
[57:01] wonderful praise the lord amen nye
[57:05] ah yes i i just go on i just go on there
[57:09] if i may praise the lord because i hope
[57:10] not to hold you too long today but amen
[57:13] brother branham says uh where did the
[57:15] dove come from when he was in the
[57:17] wilderness
[57:18] my my where did that dove come you know
[57:20] i walked that trail up there
[57:22] and uh i walked that trail and um a dove
[57:26] up there it's almost incredible that
[57:28] even a dog would have would have
[57:30] appeared there and folks i don't know
[57:31] where it came from i don't know if god
[57:32] spoke that dove or not but i know he
[57:34] could have well done so because he's god
[57:37] but all i know is there was a snow white
[57:38] dog waiting there and i'm so glad
[57:40] because his mama had dreamed a dream of
[57:42] the six the six doves uh brother aaron
[57:46] this morning was sharing with me a story
[57:48] about the dream amen and about hard
[57:50] things opened up god does speak to you
[57:52] in dreams there's no doubt about that
[57:54] and uh and he said i always knew there
[57:56] would be a seventh of and there was and
[57:59] he gave us that precious precious
[58:00] message you know if you're having an
[58:02] interview with brother branham and you
[58:04] say he said what do you think of the
[58:05] messenger coming up to when he's about
[58:07] to leave the scene he'll be shot at
[58:09] he'll be blasted out he'll be spoken
[58:12] against he'll be wounded but he'll get
[58:14] the message in hallelujah that that dove
[58:16] will come over and get the message in
[58:18] hallelujah bring the message and that's
[58:21] all he said my whole life now is to
[58:23] bring the message and to get it out to
[58:25] the people amen and i'm glad he
[58:27] succeeded on the wings of a snow white
[58:30] dove and i think we heard that today as
[58:32] well amen so it's wonderful and i want
[58:34] to tell you something else you know
[58:36] just in a moment
[58:38] about that amen not only the dove but
[58:40] something else there and it's wonderful
[58:42] praise the lord and when brother joe
[58:44] green was over uh with us in ireland and
[58:46] he preached a message uh the part of
[58:49] your need you know you all got needs
[58:52] today every i've got needs you've got
[58:53] needs
[58:54] but there's power in your need you say
[58:56] what do you mean powering your knees
[58:58] well because if you've got a need you
[59:00] have to look around to see who's going
[59:01] to meet it
[59:02] and when you look to the lord you've
[59:04] come to the right place whether the lord
[59:06] uses a doctor or whatever he uses you've
[59:08] come to the right place amen and and god
[59:12] has the power to meet your need there's
[59:14] a power calling on there's a voice
[59:15] calling out and god has got that and
[59:18] brother joe was saying you know uh the
[59:20] bible says that
[59:22] the ram was caught in a thicket
[59:25] now we think oh hallelujah you know the
[59:28] ram was there and all you know but the
[59:30] god that knew what he needed knew he
[59:34] also needed a thicket
[59:37] amen
[59:38] now
[59:39] okay let's just say brother samuel go on
[59:42] again see because you're so deep what
[59:43] you're talking about this morning you
[59:44] know let's say there hadn't been any
[59:46] thicket there well maybe he would have
[59:48] had the lamb just standing there i don't
[59:49] know
[59:50] but he needed to be caught in a ticket
[59:53] so god created a thicket
[59:55] for that ram to be caught up
[59:57] now folks i'll tell you what don't you
[1:00:00] tell me that god doesn't know your need
[1:00:02] right
[1:00:03] because i know he does and not only that
[1:00:05] there but you know whatever that need
[1:00:07] would be if you would need a little
[1:00:09] thicket
[1:00:10] he'll provide that as well hallelujah
[1:00:12] he'll do the lot hallelujah he's not a
[1:00:14] half-hearted god and when he does it
[1:00:16] it'll be done hallelujah and he'll meet
[1:00:19] your need perfectly because that
[1:00:21] is his promise amen that god would meet
[1:00:23] all you need in christ jesus that's what

[1:00:36] inspiration there's the sisters came out
[1:00:38] this morning praise god that little
[1:00:40] spack of inspiration sister that's it
[1:00:42] where people get out of the way
[1:00:44] hallelujah well you're in the presence
[1:00:46] of almighty god and he says do you
[1:00:48] believe that you say yes sir i believe
[1:00:50] it hallelujah then be it on to me
[1:00:52] according to your word amen hallelujah
[1:00:55] and you touch something hallelujah that
[1:00:57] no education or or university or no
[1:01:01] sadness could tell you anything about
[1:01:03] but you've touched something that's real
[1:01:05] hallelujah and something will happen
[1:01:08] never fails never feels amen my brother
[1:01:11] brother talked about uh murray i believe
[1:01:14] it was mary this particular time he's
[1:01:16] speaking he said something inspired her
[1:01:19] you know
[1:01:20] my
[1:01:21] she didn't realize he's going to go down
[1:01:23] to this uh this old pharisee and all the
[1:01:26] forest he wants you know
[1:01:28] is to make fun of him bring a few of his
[1:01:31] friends there and come on we'll have a
[1:01:32] good laugh at this guy you know and
[1:01:34] we'll not
[1:01:35] offer him any water for his feet you
[1:01:37] know we will not wash him wash his hands
[1:01:39] or anoint them with oil and put the
[1:01:41] special shoes on and a garment and and
[1:01:43] give him the hug and give him the kiss
[1:01:45] we'll not do that we'll just treat him
[1:01:47] like dirt because that's what we believe
[1:01:49] he is but he'll come and we'll have a
[1:01:51] good laugh and that's what they thought
[1:01:53] and when this we woman come in
[1:01:56] just came in why because the prophet
[1:01:58] said inspiration struck her
[1:02:01] inspiration she said there he has a need
[1:02:04] he has a need amen and he needed a
[1:02:07] service and i'm going to do it and she
[1:02:10] came in and i'll tell you what she got
[1:02:12] read up there and she anointed him amen
[1:02:14] and they stood back because they didn't
[1:02:16] believe you know
[1:02:19] i was reading a a book on the life of
[1:02:21] christ by one of the old scottish
[1:02:22] divines
[1:02:24] and he was saying you know something he
[1:02:26] said you take the torah
[1:02:28] take the torah you know all the torah
[1:02:29] really is
[1:02:30] and they call it the law but all the
[1:02:32] torah really is from the
[1:02:34] uh from the hebrew point of view is the
[1:02:37] thoughts of the rabbis
[1:02:39] so this rob i thought this and this
[1:02:41] rabbi i thought that and this other rob
[1:02:43] i thought this and eventually when you
[1:02:45] get the whole concoction together you
[1:02:47] can't wash your hands or you have to
[1:02:48] wash your hands or you have to do this
[1:02:50] you have to do that and you've got a
[1:02:52] rule of laws
[1:02:54] and jesus just said woe unto you
[1:02:56] hypocrites what you've done to the
[1:02:58] people you've took that pure word of god
[1:03:00] and you put your own interpretation onto
[1:03:02] it hallelujah and instead of making the
[1:03:05] children of god what they ought to be
[1:03:07] you've made this house your house and he
[1:03:09] said i'll tell you it's desolate and it
[1:03:11] sure was
[1:03:12] hypocrisy called them and that's why
[1:03:14] folks
[1:03:15] that's why you don't want to come to the
[1:03:17] word of god and put your own
[1:03:18] interpretations and do we do it this way
[1:03:20] because because what
[1:03:22] because what amen we're not interested
[1:03:25] in what hallelujah we want to know what
[1:03:27] we're doing it for amen and she did it
[1:03:29] he needed a service and she went on her
[1:03:31] inspiration and of course being
[1:03:33] hypocrites they said oh if he knew
[1:03:36] what modern woman that was
[1:03:38] well he didn't know hallelujah and when
[1:03:40] he saw you he looked beyond your fault
[1:03:43] hallelujah but i stole he looked beyond
[1:03:46] your fault hallelujah but i fell when i
[1:03:48] was a young woman he looked beyond your
[1:03:50] fault sister i ain't not your need
[1:03:52] hallelujah and he looked beyond my fault
[1:03:55] and he met my name hallelujah oh grace i
[1:03:58] tell you amen chris it's wonderful
[1:04:01] just wonderful it's wonderful praise the

[1:04:13] said here before john
[1:04:15] the type of the bride

[1:04:21] the breast of jesus christ could hear
[1:04:22] his heartbeat
[1:04:24] amen

[1:04:28] and he told him read it

[1:10:56] when it drops into your heart oh my

[1:11:31] what brother said the other night i
[1:11:33] don't know if you got this or not he
[1:11:34] said but you know
[1:11:36] the devil's not as smart as he seems you
[1:11:38] know and you say
[1:11:40] hi come he said well look when he came
[1:11:42] to schambach there were 600 philistines
[1:11:45] or whatever there were
[1:11:47] nigh praise the lord
[1:11:49] so
[1:11:50] when inspiration had shambak
[1:11:52] hallelujah schambach realized
[1:11:55] that
[1:11:56] one
[1:11:57] can cut down ten thousand
[1:11:59] so so the devil was really
[1:12:02] six hundred from ten thousand you got
[1:12:03] about nine hundred and
[1:12:05] nine thousand four hundred short before
[1:12:07] he would even come up to as many
[1:12:10] as was with schambach
[1:12:11] amen so he's not that smart he loves he
[1:12:14] likes to pretend he's like a lion like
[1:12:17] in the book of uh uh
[1:12:18] the pilgrim progress and he was there
[1:12:21] going along
[1:12:22] and he heard their lion roar
[1:12:24] and he stopped
[1:12:26] and he said i'll check this out he saw
[1:12:29] the lion what am i going to do here how
[1:12:31] am i going to get lost so anyway there
[1:12:33] was just enough faith in him this
[1:12:35] pilgrim to get a little closer
[1:12:38] and you know the closer you get the
[1:12:40] lighter the line can roar
[1:12:42] and here as he was going along
[1:12:45] he realized something
[1:12:47] all the lines roar
[1:12:50] but he noticed it was chained
[1:12:52] there you are folks he'll make a lot of
[1:12:54] noise you know circumstances i i've got
[1:12:57] some notes down there on fear oh boy
[1:13:00] fear's a real thing you know i know
[1:13:01] he'll make a lot of noise and and i'll
[1:13:03] tell you what he does but you know
[1:13:05] something if you realize he's tuned

[1:13:14] proved that i was in the la i was in the
[1:13:16] lion's mouth
[1:13:18] but isn't it wonderful folks to prove
[1:13:21] that he couldn't close his mouth
[1:13:24] that's the victory hallelujah that's the
[1:13:27] victory oh i was there i know i was
[1:13:29] there but he couldn't close the night he
[1:13:31] couldn't finish the job hallelujah but
[1:13:34] it would god he'll finish the job amen
[1:13:36] okay
[1:13:37] well the prophet talks about the
[1:13:38] mechanics and the dynamics and i just
[1:13:41] want to mention a few more things try
[1:13:42] and get it over with this morning this
[1:13:44] afternoon amen but praise the lord it is

[1:14:08] you it's like you're a little motor
[1:14:09] automobile until uh
[1:14:12] it uh gets the dynamics amen it ain't
[1:14:15] going nowhere it needs out it needs the
[1:14:16] firing power amen and brother branham

[1:14:21] presence of the pillar of fire and let

[1:15:21] for amen here's the dynamics and praise
[1:15:24] the lord we're the members we're the
[1:15:26] machine he's the body and the holy ghost
[1:15:28] is the fire that's going to take us
[1:15:30] there uniting himself with us
[1:15:32] and uh amen before the wedding supper
[1:15:36] and we're waiting and we're watching for
[1:15:38] that glad millennial day it's coming
[1:15:40] amen now i said earlier on you know
[1:15:42] moses was in the desert i told you this
[1:15:44] morning paul was in the desert he got
[1:15:46] the new testament brother branham was
[1:15:48] also in the desert is that right that's
[1:15:50] why god took him right over to arizona
[1:15:52] get him away from all
[1:15:54] man and get him right up there in that
[1:15:56] desert desert mountains amen where he
[1:15:58] could deal and talk with his prophet
[1:16:00] praise the lord and that's exactly what
[1:16:02] he what he did amen and uh people talk
[1:16:05] about the cloud picture folks what about
[1:16:07] the revelation of the seven seals
[1:16:09] amen what about that hallelujah praise
[1:16:12] god you know and i i think i've got it
[1:16:14] down somewhere amen but the critics
[1:16:17] i i haven't heard any critics about the
[1:16:19] seven sales i don't know you haven't
[1:16:21] nobody's ever said oh i don't believe
[1:16:24] that you know because i'll tell you why
[1:16:26] because too many denominations are
[1:16:27] borrowed from it
[1:16:29] and so therefore therefore they're not
[1:16:31] going to deny it because say pastor you
[1:16:33] preached that last week
[1:16:35] but they just don't say they got it from
[1:16:36] brother branham that's that that's the
[1:16:37] truth see but there thus saith the lord
[1:16:40] amen and there he was amen and the books
[1:16:42] are sealed with seven seals it will also
[1:16:45] require the same
[1:16:47] wilderness experience as paul and he's
[1:16:50] talking about there in the old testament
[1:16:51] and moses and paul so there you are and
[1:16:54] that's how it came he said i believe in
[1:16:56] these days to open those seven sales
[1:16:58] amen now i'll go down a little bit more
[1:17:01] but i've been studying on the book of
[1:17:03] daniel one of the churches wants me to
[1:17:05] preach in the book of daniel and it's
[1:17:07] been hard going i can tell you that it
[1:17:09] really has been hard going but i'm
[1:17:10] nearly there by the grace of god and the
[1:17:13] conclusion i drew is that we know more
[1:17:16] about the book of daniel sister regina
[1:17:18] than daniel did
[1:17:19] now there's something hallelujah when
[1:17:21] you can go up to the author of a book
[1:17:22] and say hey buddy i know more about that
[1:17:24] you knew they they say oh you should
[1:17:26] that's terrible you shouldn't speak
[1:17:28] about the prophet daniel they got him
[1:17:29] but it's true
[1:17:31] it is true because the angel said daniel
[1:17:33] you seal it up to the end time and you
[1:17:34] stay in your lot
[1:17:36] well we're at the end time and the
[1:17:37] prophets came along and all that truth
[1:17:39] in the book of daniel we've got it today
[1:17:42] so hallelujah we do know more about the
[1:17:44] book of daniel and daniel that amen now
[1:17:47] amen we're joining with word amen see
[1:17:50] nothing else can do it we know the day
[1:17:52] that we're living amen and we're looking
[1:17:54] for that amen the minority group under
[1:17:56] the inspiration of god this is what he
[1:17:57] said
[1:17:58] that's what we're doing you know the
[1:17:59] whole message has been inspiration folks
[1:18:01] it's an inspiration amen no matter what
[1:18:03] you pick up what you read it's just an
[1:18:05] inspiration amen praise the lord uh do
[1:18:08] you believe that god is in all
[1:18:09] inspiration brother brother says amen
[1:18:12] and god has to read a song
[1:18:15] do you believe god can write songs
[1:18:17] i just proved early wrong and not and
[1:18:19] not and not there amen and brother brown
[1:18:22] goes on to say he said sure he said
[1:18:23] jesus referred back to david sure he did
[1:18:26] to the psalms

[1:40:44] it's all spiritually revealed truth
[1:40:47] laying right there but it takes the
[1:40:49] spiritual mind to catch it
[1:40:51] so there you are young people if you
[1:40:53] think you figured it out or you haven't
[1:40:54] figured it out you won't figure it out
[1:40:57] it takes a spiritual mind
[1:40:59] for you to say god i don't know what it
[1:41:01] means will you reveal it to me and see
[1:41:04] what happens amen humble yourself and he
[1:41:06] says
[1:41:07] rest on that

[1:41:22] know
[1:41:23] you don't even need to worry about what

[1:41:26] god showed you amen but brother i i
[1:41:29] don't know as much as you you don't have
[1:41:30] to know as much as me i don't know a lot

[1:47:19] desire in his heart
[1:47:20] for a super race of people
[1:47:23] a blind race
[1:47:25] could it be that he picked up that
[1:47:27] anointing
[1:47:29] because that's what the prophet come

[1:53:08] amen and amen
[1:53:10] following others just don't pass me by
[1:53:13] make sure you stop my lord
[1:53:16] because that's what we needed
[1:53:20] we need inspiration
[1:53:23] because with inspiration
[1:53:26] it'll work
[1:53:30] ministers understand that maybe more
[1:53:32] than
[1:53:33] this laity because you know you have to
[1:53:35] speak and
[1:53:37] you want an
[1:53:38] inspiration and it's not we think it's a
[1:53:42] great big anointing that drops down that
[1:53:44] you know it's around you no it's just a
[1:53:47] thought
[1:53:50] that comes in your mind
[1:53:53] [Music]
[1:53:54] an inspiration can just be one word
[1:53:58] to a preacher that's all it takes
[1:54:01] all i need is that one word
[1:54:06] and i can't preach for weeks off of it
[1:54:09] because it's inspiration
[1:54:12] i love the presence of the lord and the
[1:54:14] feeling and the shout and all of that
[1:54:15] that's part of it
[1:54:18] but that's not
[1:54:19] the anointing
[1:54:21] that's supreme power in control amen
[1:54:24] but inspiration
[1:54:26] revelation
[1:54:29] is a better way of saying it
[1:54:32] but we need the prophet said it's
[1:54:33] revelation
[1:54:34] more than anything else
[1:54:37] we need a revelation
[1:54:39] so pray for revelation for god to speak
[1:54:41] to your heart
[1:54:43] and then you'll see a lot of things amen
[1:54:45] let's sing one more before we go brother
