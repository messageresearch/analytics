========================================

[Music] god bless you and good morning let's turn back to hebrews chapter 2 verse 12 which is where we kind of left off last time [Music] and verse 12 says [Music] saying i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will i sing praise unto thee again i will put my trust in him and again behold i and the children which god has given me and last time we were kind of talking about how that that as you read these things that paul says um you know he's just fire and firing from the hip uh saying things rapidly and and a lot of it it would it would mean things to hebrews to a jew but without a lot of background some of these things would kind of go over our heads so we we're tying back this back to what what paul was quoting there in verse 13 last time was uh i will put my trust in him that's actually from psalms and again behold i and the children which god has given me is from isaiah and he's he's saying i will in isaiah isaiah said i will wait upon the lord that hideth his face from the house of jacob and i will look for him behold i and the children whom the lord hath given me are for signs and for wonders in israel from the lord of hosts which dwelleth in mount zion and if we go to the next slide just to kind of give a little background isaiah is talking about his he is his his two children share joshua a remnant which means a remnant will return and my herschel of hashbas which means quick to plunder swift to spoil and and his two children were given to him as as signs that when he would go to give his message to king ahaz he would take his children with him as a as a sign well he took shahir jashub with him and mahershala hashpaws was given a little bit later in the next chapter in isaiah to as as a further sign of what god will do if you didn't recognize his word and didn't obey him so isaiah 8 18 talking about behold i and the children whom the lord had given me are for signs and for wonders in israel from the lord of hosts so that's really speaking compare that with with what paul is saying in hebrews i am the children which god has given me paul is talking about uh the the child christ that has been given to us that would we would be part of and that we also with him would be would be signs to the world as we go and live our lives and and things which if you go to the next slide in john chapter 17 it says i have manifested thy name john speaking to the church i have manifested thy name unto that unto the men which thou get gave us me out of the world thine they were and thou gave us them me and they have kept that word so again that just goes hand in hand with what isaiah and paul are saying here behold i and the children which god has given me we're part we're part of jesus christ and and uh as galatians says for you are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus so um if if maybe that kind of wets your appetite to dive into that a little bit more go back and if you if you weren't here last sunday go back and listen to that last sunday school and and uh that that maybe maybe a little bit more details than that if we go to the next slide in uh verse 14 paul says for as much of them as the children so we're just talking about isaiah's children typing the children of god for as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same he came down to to to go through the the same troubles and things that we go through that through death he might destroy them that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetimes subject to bondage so his purpose was to give us a way out of death and brother brown said that day on calvary that day on calvary he said that's what calvary meant men that were in bondage were set free men that were once under fear of death can no longer fear death a man who longs for a city whose builder and maker is god he can step on the highway and set his face towards heaven because he's free and why is he free because he has he has an understanding that god has delivered him from the the price of sin of he's given he's covered over the sin with his blood and he's he's he's paid the price for it and he's redeemed that man even though that maybe he still has to uh maybe in the lie in life death will catch up with you but yet the the the price of sin has been has been paid he's redeemed he said he don't need to wonder no more for there's a way of knowing whether you are right or not it isn't that a blessing to know we can sit here and know whether we're right or not and to know whether god has taken care of the situation or not to have a revelation to know that god has has has come on the scene for you and accepted your faith god gives us life our sins are gone that day at calvary paid the price so that's what paul is saying that christ came to take away the fear of death to take away the fear of living knowing that one day you're going to have to cross over that that chilly jordan river and and then you know even beyond that it as the message began to unfold that the last enemy is death we know so one day there's going to be somebody that that that does not even taste death that uh comes to a place of faith and of revelation to know that you've come you've com you can just step over it leap over a troop as the scripture goes so if we go to the next slide paul is talking about in first corinthians so when this corruptable shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory o death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law so christ took away this the sting of death as we know the type of beings being stung by like a little bee that was the stinger stun stuck in him and it can't sting us anymore and the sting of death is sin so he took away he took away all of the sin from us now now how did he do it if we go you you know what paul's doing is in the first two chapters here is he's and and all through hebrews is he's comparing all of these things that the hebrews know about the angels the ministers the prophets and the law the torah that he's given it to us and he's saying that christ is the one that satisfies everything christ is above the angels he's above the ministers he's the one that we're looking at and so he as he goes on he's he's uh he's establishing that further as we read along that christ is the one that actually in the old testament you read about the seed of abraham and christ is the one that took upon himself the seed of abraham to satisfy what the law is talking about to fulfill what it's talking about so if we go to the next the next slide the seed of abraham we know that the seed of abraham is christ and we'll we'll kind of we'll kind of sit on this for a little bit longer in this little lesson what is what is the seed of abraham the seed of abraham was that promise that that god gave to abraham that thus and isaac thy seed shall be called and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies and thy seed will the whole world all the nations of the world be blessed through that seed so they see that you think about the seed of abraham being manifest in that little child crying in a in a manger there the seed of abraham was was was was the life of god made made manifest in in the flesh of a little baby that you really what what the seed of abraham is and what we'll dive into that a little bit more but looking at whether some of the things that brother brown said was it if we go to the next slide the seed this a seed is life it's got life in it so the seed of abraham has got something to do with life now if we go to the next slide after that and brother ram said oh my he didn't become an angel he become the seed of abraham and we being dead in christ take on abraham's seed and our heirs according to the promise he he never took on the form of an angel he never become an angel he'd become a man he become veiled in flesh that that life was put in flesh the same life so you see that if that life was in christ and that same life is in you and that makes you a seed of abraham that makes you part of that same life he said he become the seed of abraham and took the sting of death in his own flesh to reconcile us back to god and now sits there for an intercessor my how could we reject it friend now if we go to the next slide let's just do a little recap of where where in the bible the promise of the seed of abraham was given to abraham in genesis chapter 26 god told abraham sojourn in this land and i will be with thee and will bless thee for unto thee and unto thy seed i want maybe one thing to kind of call out is i think this should give us confidence in this hour you know when you can when you pray and when you read the bible you you take these promises back knowing what the secret of abraham is and knowing that how you're connected to that you can take these promises back to god and lay them in front of him and say you promised it now bring it to pass he said sojourn in this land and i will be with you and will bless thee for unto thee and under thy seed i will give all these countries and i will perform the oath which i swear unto abraham thy father of course we know we know the seed it's got it's got like a there's a natural that in the natural abraham had his children he had a isaac and jacob and all of the 12 tribes and then from there they they you know propagated and filled the earth and and abraham didn't see a lot of these promises fulfilled in his day but when they came back from egypt all his his children returned back to the promised land and they saw the promises fulfilled that abraham was was promised back here in in genesis and he said i will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven and i will give unto thy seed all these countries and in thy seas shall all the nations of the earth be blessed and there's that promise looking up to the stars of heaven a promise of something spiritual happening in one place he'd look down at the sand your seed is going to be like the sand that's that natural children of israel but looking up to the stars that's us that's you and i sitting here today that that that spiritual seed and through that seed all the nations of the earth will be blessed through what christ has done in our lives because that abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge my commandments my statutes and my laws now in galatians chapter 3 verse 16 paul is saying now to abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not in the seasons of many but as a one and to thy seed which is which is christ that one seed not not not there's not a lot of different ideas there are not a lot a lot of different theologies there's only one that we go back to to get what we believe and that's christ the the one there's one that's living in our lives that that's why is that a as as the spirit of god has been manifested in our lives it's bringing into oneness with him because there's not a lot of different ideas that we're there's there's one truth there's one spirit there's one baptism one one way to get to get to god and he's that way but as a many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ now brother ran on the next light he said hear the seed and the seed is not air with the shuck he said hear the seed one one seed not seeds but one seed these seeds were not seed of abraham because abraham's seed was his faith seed that god was speaking of not his natural seed so they were elevating the abraham's seed to something it's not just natural but a spiritual in other words abraham abraham had a faith where he was able to look beyond the things that you could just see with your natural eye and he was looking to something supernatural he was looking to something unseen so when god gave him a promise that he was going to have a child he began to discard all of the all of the things that he could see with his natural eye getting older getting frailer getting weaker maybe sicknesses things and he began to look past that to a god that was able to make things come to pass he said because after sarah died abraham married another woman and had seven sons besides daughter so it wouldn't be abraham's seeds it was abraham's seed one and that was abraham's faith seed pointing to the royal seed that was to come through abraham's faith not abraham's natural life but abraham's spiritual life something spiritual taking place and that's why when we say well we're abraham c that you you you've got to dovetail with what abraham typed back there in the old testament to believe believe past all of the things that you can see with your natural eyes and not care about circumstances not care if what the doctor says or not care about uh maybe even others that don't seem like they're getting a blessing it doesn't matter what matters is god's word his word is the only thing that matters right so when you say you're abraham see you're saying something really great that god's life that same life is actually living inside you the same one that told abraham where to go and called him and and moved him from point a to point b that same one is living in you to testify and make you believe his word that's why brother braham said who took everything contrary to god's word and called as though it was not and believed god against hope believed in hope that's the real seed that we're speaking of now if we go to the next slide galatians 3 28 says there is neither jew nor greek paul talking about there's neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for you are all one in christ jesus and if you be christ then are ye abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise so there there's your confidence right there and what what that you are abraham's seed if you're filled with the holy ghost and you're christ and you're part of him now verse 28 is something that's been debated a lot i i've heard people argue well well what you see this is the they'll say this is a scripture that says well women can preach in church and and and there's no difference between male and female and church and those sorts of things but no what this is what paul is saying here is that not not that there's no difference in that regard but when you with your access to god there's no difference in other words a woman in the church has the same access to christ at a male as the church there's no difference in the way if you've got a need in your in your life you can come to god just as boldly as a minister can a little sister a little child anybody in church can come because you're just as much abraham's seed as a minister behind the pulpit that's why i believe that the words of paul here are encouraging to us they're not discouraging they're encouraging to us to know that if you've got a problem in your life or if you've got some you've got these promises that you can lay hold to to know that same one that was with abraham he's with you now now you see on the next slide you gotta tie light the seat of abraham back to life and that's what you know in that message why it had to be shepherds by the ground he kind of labored on how that shepherd is not doesn't know so much about education it's not some major major and so much about politics and those kind of things but a shepherd it knows about life a shepherd can is guiding a sheep to where they can get life from so that they stay alive and they bear forth fruit and bear forth that that wool so that seed of abraham the same same way it's it's life and so brother and he swore by himself he said what is the seed of abraham abraham believed god and he said this little blood cell blood is where your life is he said a portion of it was in a shadow a shadow now a toning on abraham blood that blood in other words the life of god was back there working and moving in abraham's life despite all the circumstances and despite all the the failings and things that that abraham could see and then a lot getting taken away and having to go taking his men to fight after him and all of those kind of things it was the life of god working in his life and brother ram said he believed god it was imputed to him for righteousness because abraham believed in that life of god believed in god it was his faith was imputed to him for righteousness in other words god overlooked all of abraham's failings and all the things that he did wrong and said yeah but you believe me and because he believed it he t he he he like he he he just regarded abraham as as though he was righteousness he applied his own righteousness and abraham now that god's doing the same thing to us now if we believe god the same way that abraham believed god then despite all of our problems and our failings and things i'm not talking about greasy grace i'm talking about real believing he imputes his righteousness to us he gives he imparts his his righteousness to us to make us as righteous as god is and he said god called abraham by sovereign grace not because he was abraham he was just a man he said now look and every one of god's children is called the same way you can't save yourself there's nothing you can do if you're a sinner you can't come to god unless god called you jesus said no man can come to me except my father calls him and when the father calls him all that comes i'll give him everlasting life and i'll raise him up at the last day so what is a seed now see the seed of abraham we're talking about is life now that's why you click on that word if you're reading the bible and that with with that the table app that lets you click on the word and go back to the original greek lexicon it means that word seed means comes from the greek word sperma and i think we all know what that means and and the first definition highlighted there says from which a plant germinates the seed the green or kernel which contains it's within itself the germ of the future plants and highlighted further down whatever possesses vital force of life giving power so that seed of abraham is the life the seed of abraham is the life that that abraham was looking to it's the life actual the life of god so when you receive that seed when god puts his life in you then then you begin to understand and you begin to grow if we'll go to the next slide in matthew chapter 23 that parable that jesus gave he said he that receiveth seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word and understandeth it you think what we're doing as we're receiving this word and this spirit is quickening it it gives us understanding that that we are part of that same life that spoke to abraham and it's going to bear forth fruit and first john it says whoever is born of god does not commit sin why for his seed remaineth in him that seed of abraham is down in there so a real believer can't even sin a real believer why why can you not sin because the believer the believer the real believer the one that wrote the bible is on the inside and you cannot see him which means disbelief you can't disbelieve you can't just believe god's word because his seed is in you now now you could go you could go way down deep the rabbit hole or whatever with that and talk about all because you know brother ram said things like a christians are all the ones that sin but what does that mean we're down on the inside of your soul with that seed of abraham is there and it's given life in you and in your soul you cannot sin but yet in life in your spirit realm and in your flesh you can you go through life and you can you can make problems and think you constantly have to have to repent every day you're dying and so in your spirit realm you can you can make mistakes and do things that you need to repent of but down on the inside way down deep in that place that that that's really guiding you if it's been changed that seed of abraham is dwelling there and you're a real believer because you can't doubt the word you come to church and the world is preached and you you there's something inside of you that's got to say amen and and make you grieve when you do things wrong make you grieve when the outside man does things that are wrong but but his seed remains in you so you can't you can't sin i i i maybe i'm i'm very dogmatic about that but i believe it to the point that if you're really born again you're you're not going to leave this message if you're really born again this that's his seed is in you you're not you're not you're not going to get get uh pulled away by some some some odd doctrine or something because his seed remains in you right now if you go to the next slide brother braham said he swore by himself now who is the seed of abraham those who are filled with the holy ghost are seeds of abraham why because that seed you've received the seed and the seed is the life you've received the seed of his word and it's taken root in your heart and it's beginning to grow and grow like a little plant until it's sprouting up and maybe initially you don't see fruit but yeah give it time give it some time to grow like like when you're you're boiling a pot of water you don't sit there and look at it and you you plant the seed in the ground you don't sit there and look at it wait for it to come up but by and by is going to come up as you keep watering it keep coming to church and keep doing the things that a christian does by and by it will bear fruit that's what the seed of abraham is somebody that's been planted in christ and that same life that that same life is living in you amen in genesis 22 20 16 it says i said by myself i sworn god told abraham saith the lord for because thou has done this thing and it's not withheld that son and that only son that in blessing i'm this is the promise of the seed of abraham that in blessing i will bless thee and the musician can go ahead and come forward and we'll close on this that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies and in that seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice so if you've got a promise that his seed will possess the gate of every enemy amen amen be blessed [Applause]
