[0:00] your bibles if you want to turn to uh
[0:02] what we read
[0:05] genesis 4 verse 26
[0:10] we're still talking on prayer
[0:14] and uh i hope you all prayed this
[0:17] morning
[0:18] amen we need to be a prayerful group of
[0:22] people
[0:24] because we need prayer and you need to
[0:27] practice
[0:28] genesis 4 verse 26 and says to seth and
[0:30] him also there was born a son
[0:32] and he called his name enos and then men
[0:34] began to call upon the name of the lord
[0:36] it took several generations because from
[0:40] adam
[0:40] adam and abel and and uh
[0:44] cain even we're able to talk to god
[0:47] the bible says in genesis 1 genesis 2
[0:49] even genesis 3
[0:51] when god said i'll put enmity he was
[0:52] talking straight to adam he was talking
[0:54] straight to eve
[0:55] amen and then he was talking straight to
[0:58] abel and straight to cain he definitely
[1:00] talked to cain several times in genesis
[1:03] in genesis three and four as we look and
[1:06] see
[1:06] even chapter four he talked straight to
[1:09] cain and said if you'll do as your
[1:11] brother so there was no mediator in
[1:13] between that there was no
[1:15] communication gap god spoke straight to
[1:19] cain and said if you'll do good
[1:20] do as your brother everything will be
[1:21] fine but then god knew
[1:24] when cain left the presence of god
[1:28] god knew one thing for sure he couldn't
[1:30] talk to him he couldn't come to the
[1:31] garden anymore he couldn't sit down with
[1:33] man he couldn't
[1:34] he couldn't be with man like he wanted
[1:36] to be so he had to institute a thing
[1:39] called prayer
[1:41] and then because if we began to call
[1:44] upon the name of the lord
[1:46] don't look where it says in your
[1:48] marginal reading i was just reading that
[1:49] it said but then man began to call upon
[1:51] the name of the lord
[1:52] now the name of the lord they didn't
[1:54] know what the name of the lord was back
[1:55] then
[1:56] so they called him jehovah because
[1:58] scofield says call himself by the name
[2:00] of jehovah
[2:01] so that's where you got jehovah god with
[2:03] the family in the old testament
[2:06] they prayed to jehovah but we know that
[2:09] that was what
[2:10] that was the part of jesus christ the
[2:12] part of almighty god that he was playing
[2:14] at the time
[2:15] it was jehovah and then that jehovah
[2:17] brother brown said jehovah the old
[2:19] became what jesus of the new
[2:21] so like i said before we don't have two
[2:23] or three mediators to go through
[2:25] when i pray i don't pray to an angel
[2:27] that prays to
[2:28] jesus now we know brother branham used
[2:30] several
[2:32] instances where that he says the angels
[2:35] would take the prayer requests to the
[2:37] lord now see that's just a line of
[2:38] communication
[2:40] because we talk as christians we talk
[2:42] straight to god
[2:43] and man we don't talk to an angel uh but
[2:46] now remember see
[2:47] you you gotta remember um
[2:51] gabriel was an angel but remember
[2:54] michael was christ
[2:56] so it was an angel but now remember too
[2:59] we're going to read this afternoon
[3:02] gabriel was an announcing angel in other
[3:04] words he was given to the jews in the
[3:06] old testament
[3:07] to bring something to the people to
[3:10] bring an announcement because he came to
[3:11] daniel to announce the 70 weeks of
[3:13] daniel
[3:14] he came to mary to announce that she
[3:18] was going to have a child now see we
[3:20] don't have to have that angel to come
[3:21] announce anything to us we have michael
[3:24] we have christ that immorphy of god has
[3:27] moved from
[3:28] an angel in the old testament to a
[3:30] person named jesus christ because
[3:32] that's who i pray to i don't pray to
[3:35] michael
[3:36] i pray to jesus christ which is michael
[3:38] but he was
[3:39] he had a form back then that he couldn't
[3:41] he couldn't relate to man
[3:43] i say relate because remember god is
[3:45] eternal
[3:47] that's what i was trying to get this
[3:49] thought across to myself the other day
[3:51] god is eternal but he did have a time
[3:54] where
[3:54] like i said we don't pray to jehovah
[3:56] anymore now he never lost that title
[3:59] he's still jehovah
[4:00] god all the compound names of jehovah he
[4:03] is still god he's still jehovah god
[4:05] but now he and morphed down into
[4:06] melchizedek
[4:08] so that we could understand him in a
[4:09] certain area there then he was the
[4:11] captain of the host that we understood
[4:13] him in a certain
[4:14] area there then he became our brother
[4:18] see that's what we're going to talk
[4:19] about this afternoon he became our
[4:20] brother he became
[4:22] not a type of boaz was the type of
[4:24] christ
[4:25] see a lot of things top christ but
[4:27] christ doesn't type anything that's why
[4:28] i said the bride doesn't type
[4:30] the whole bible types christ and if the
[4:32] whole bible types christ
[4:34] and you and i are what christ made
[4:36] manifest in another form then the whole
[4:37] bible
[4:39] is typing me and you because if i'm a
[4:41] type of christ i can be something
[4:43] different
[4:44] but if i am christ made manifest in
[4:46] another form it's type in christ is
[4:48] typing me
[4:49] that's why paul says christ in you the
[4:52] hope of glory so he pointed exactly
[4:54] where christ was but in the old
[4:55] testament
[4:56] there had to be something instituted we
[4:58] know that he instituted the
[5:00] the ark and all the different things and
[5:02] but remember
[5:03] god didn't communicate with man after a
[5:07] certain period of time in exodus 19 they
[5:09] said okay let moses
[5:11] let abraham you know let let this other
[5:13] person pray let this important guy pray
[5:15] for
[5:16] for me for us and that's the way god set
[5:18] it up in the old testament
[5:20] because that's what the jews asked for
[5:22] because remember he told moses he said
[5:24] you bring him back to this mountain he
[5:26] said i'll talk to him just like i talked
[5:28] to you
[5:28] on this same mountain and they said no
[5:31] we don't want that
[5:33] we want to we want a mediator we want
[5:35] something in between
[5:36] all right well the only mediator we have
[5:39] though is not moses
[5:40] not william branham's not a prophet it's
[5:43] jesus christ
[5:44] amen so but that was instituted in the
[5:47] old testament
[5:48] so that there would be a law and that
[5:52] law though
[5:53] brought christ on the scene they just
[5:54] didn't know that
[5:56] all right so look prayer let's pull it
[5:58] up now we
[5:59] as we were reading last sunday prayer is
[6:02] an invocation or act that seeks to
[6:04] activate a rapport with an object of
[6:06] worship
[6:07] through deliberate communication well
[6:10] lord thank you for this food no
[6:11] you want him in this day and time more
[6:14] than any
[6:16] you better pray over your food
[6:19] everything
[6:19] if if uh if the guy in the in the
[6:22] um confederate soldier who was a
[6:25] stonewall jackson
[6:27] it was noted that he never took a drink
[6:28] of water without saying thank you lord
[6:31] now do we do that no we don't do that
[6:33] don't shake your head
[6:34] not 100 of the time but maybe we should
[6:38] stop and and say god thank you because
[6:40] you know what water can make you sick
[6:42] faster than food can that's what's wrong
[6:46] with a lot of these third world
[6:47] countries they're getting
[6:48] bad water and it causes diarrhea and all
[6:50] different things which causes
[6:51] other diseases but prayer then we
[6:55] continually be in prayer look in the
[6:56] narrow sense
[6:58] the term refers to an act of
[6:59] supplication or intercession now
[7:01] what does that mean you have set
[7:02] yourself aside to do something
[7:05] i'm going to enter into as the priest
[7:08] enter entered in to go into that holy of
[7:10] holies man
[7:11] talking about having to be right one
[7:15] little act off of that priest
[7:17] and it was certain death under bulls and
[7:19] goats but see under the blood of jesus
[7:21] christ you and i now can go boldly to
[7:23] the throne of grace
[7:25] with prayer of intercession with prayer
[7:27] of faith
[7:28] directed toward a deity which we know
[7:30] who that deity is the world does not
[7:32] know
[7:32] a lot of times who they're praying to
[7:34] right
[7:37] that's why they don't get anything
[7:39] because the bible tells us and i'll
[7:41] bring it out maybe next sunday
[7:42] the bible says that you can pray in
[7:44] other words or say jesus jesus
[7:47] and not get anything the prophet said
[7:48] and the bible says you can come to me in
[7:50] that day and said have i not prayed
[7:52] prophesied
[7:52] spoke in tongues and done all these
[7:54] things he said depart from me i never
[7:55] knew you what you never knew who you
[7:56] were praying
[7:58] amen because you know what in this day
[8:01] and age the world can be praying to the
[8:02] devil
[8:04] and think they're praying to jesus
[8:05] christ well that's how bad it is
[8:08] but we know as the bride we know that
[8:10] our prayer
[8:12] is heard by god
[8:15] all right so let's go genesis 13 8 this
[8:17] is where the first time
[8:20] now remember that word i
[8:23] pray thee and abram and light
[8:26] means an an exhortation or i pray that
[8:29] we can finish this service today
[8:31] well that's not a prayer to something
[8:33] that's just a term and i want to bring
[8:35] that
[8:35] in because a lot of times you see that
[8:37] and it's not a prayer
[8:39] so the first time a prayer was was
[8:40] genesis 20 verse 7
[8:43] it says therefore restore the man and
[8:45] his wife for he is a prophet and he
[8:46] shall pray for thee
[8:48] now see god used prophets in the old
[8:50] testament
[8:52] amen so you got to have though it wasn't
[8:56] that abimelech prayed
[8:57] to abram or abraham and then abraham
[9:00] prayed to god he just went to abraham
[9:02] and said
[9:02] you need to pray for me all right and
[9:05] god heard that prayer and you know what
[9:07] happened
[9:08] but that one was is the greek lexicon
[9:12] or hebrew says to mediate intervene
[9:15] interpose to intercede
[9:18] or to pray come on in sister clinton
[9:23] bless your heart good to see no no ma'am
[9:27] no ma'am i'd have helped you in the door
[9:29] if you didn't notice you
[9:31] bless your heart good to see you good to
[9:34] see you sister's back there waiting on
[9:35] you your sister's back there waiting on
[9:36] you
[9:40] [Applause]
[9:44] no doubt what a testimony
[9:48] and there's the power of prayer just
[9:51] walk through the door
[9:52] amen because you know prayer changes
[9:55] things what if you just don't pray
[9:57] could you imagine going through your
[9:58] life and just don't pray
[10:01] at all what would you as a christian i
[10:04] see as a christian
[10:05] how could you be a christian and not be
[10:07] motivated to pray
[10:09] you can't right because always something
[10:11] to pray for there's always something to
[10:13] to to help others you know pray for this
[10:16] one pray for that one
[10:17] we got all these long lists of prayers
[10:19] that we pray for people
[10:22] the wall downstairs we always try it i
[10:24] can't name every one of them hundred and
[10:25] something people on the wall but i
[10:26] always
[10:27] tell god to save those people in this
[10:30] wall right under my feet that we've got
[10:31] in the sunday school class
[10:34] now look genesis 20 verse 17 so abraham
[10:38] prayed unto god and god healed the bible
[10:40] and his wife and his maidservants they
[10:41] bear children
[10:42] so theirs was the prayer of intercession
[10:44] and then god interceded
[10:46] i'm going to try to hurry through this
[10:48] psalms 5 verse 1
[10:50] because i want to get to we prayed the
[10:52] lord's prayer and i want to start
[10:54] right there with everything but i want
[10:55] to get a background for those of you
[10:57] that weren't here
[10:59] hearken to the voice of my cry verse 2
[11:01] my king my god for unto thee i will pray
[11:04] now who is david praying to he's praying
[11:06] to jehovah god
[11:08] he's praying to jehovah my voice shalt
[11:11] thou hear in the morning o lord in the
[11:12] morning will i direct my prayer
[11:14] unto thee and we'll look up proverbs 15
[11:16] verse 8
[11:17] the sacrifice of the wicked is an
[11:19] abomination to the lord look but the
[11:21] prayer of the upright is his delight he
[11:24] loves for you to pray
[11:26] isaiah 56 verse 7 even them will i bring
[11:30] to my holy mountain and make them joyful
[11:32] in my house of prayer
[11:34] this is the scripture i told you that
[11:36] jesus was quoting when he was driving
[11:37] the
[11:38] the money changers out of the temple
[11:40] they burnt offerings and sacrifices
[11:42] shall be accepted
[11:43] upon my altar for mine house shall be
[11:45] called the house of prayer
[11:47] for all people that's why we pray over
[11:50] everything we pray over
[11:52] the people we pray over the service i
[11:54] hope you're prayed up before you get
[11:55] here
[11:56] then we pray for the sick and you should
[11:58] be in constant prayer because we're
[12:00] going to get down here real quick
[12:02] where even as they were praying in the
[12:04] new testament the holy ghost fell on the
[12:06] people
[12:06] praying not worshiping not singing they
[12:10] were praying
[12:12] and the holy ghost fell on the people
[12:14] daniel 9 verse 20 we're going to get
[12:15] into this afternoon a little bit more
[12:16] but look while
[12:17] i was speaking and praying and
[12:20] confessing my sins
[12:23] try that sometime confess your sins
[12:25] first and then begin to pray
[12:27] as i said before when when someone comes
[12:30] up for prayer you hear me you see me
[12:31] raise my hand close my eyes i'm saying
[12:33] lord don't let me
[12:34] forgive me in my sins don't let me don't
[12:36] let an evil something i brought in here
[12:38] and a spirit you never you oh y'all
[12:41] don't bring spirits in there okay
[12:46] yeah we do the thoughts in our mind is a
[12:50] spirit if it's wrong against god it's
[12:51] wrong
[12:52] so i'll raise my hand and say god don't
[12:54] clear me out don't let anything happen
[12:58] for my cause to make that person not
[13:00] receive their healing
[13:01] so confessing my sins and the sins of my
[13:03] people israel presenting my suffocation
[13:05] before the lord
[13:06] now what happened when daniel got on his
[13:08] knees and prayed
[13:09] somebody showed up
[13:12] yet while i was speaking in prayer even
[13:15] the man gabriel who had seen in the
[13:17] vision at the beginning being called
[13:18] to fly swiftly touched me about the time
[13:21] of the evening
[13:22] oblation so he got what he was asking
[13:26] for
[13:27] daniel was asking how much time we got
[13:29] left what's going on and all the way to
[13:31] the end of time
[13:32] all right and then we're going to read
[13:33] this afternoon daniel 9 24.
[13:36] matthew 5 verse 44 but i say unto you
[13:39] love your enemies
[13:40] bless them that curse you do good to
[13:43] them that hate you and pray for them
[13:44] which despitefully use you
[13:47] do we do that do we feel our prayer with
[13:48] just people that are nice to us
[13:50] and good to us and pray for the all
[13:52] these this this sister just
[13:54] she just loves me i'm going to pray for
[13:55] her but now that nobody understands
[13:57] can't talk to me in about two three
[13:58] weeks i
[13:59] i don't have enough time to pray for
[14:01] that one no you need to pray more for
[14:02] that one
[14:03] first yourself then pray for that one
[14:06] and then this one might be okay
[14:08] right there's an order of prayer
[14:11] ask forgiveness of your sins
[14:16] i'm just saying yes while i was speaking
[14:18] but look matthew 5 verse 44 blessed in
[14:21] the curse you do them to good that hate
[14:22] you
[14:22] pray for them which despitefully use you
[14:24] and persecute you persecute you
[14:27] lord bless that person that's
[14:28] persecuting me how many of you prayed
[14:30] that prayer
[14:31] don't raise your hand because you're not
[14:32] going to you'll be praying for lying
[14:34] spirit on you
[14:39] i mean really when it comes down to
[14:41] prayer prayer is easy to pray
[14:43] when it's somebody that's your friend or
[14:45] somebody that's that
[14:46] you like but what about that guy that
[14:48] just at work he just
[14:50] or she just on your last nerve all the
[14:52] time
[14:54] and don't pray that god would take them
[14:55] out of the way or out off the scene
[14:57] either i'll be doing that
[15:00] pray that they get saved that's my
[15:03] prayer to people i said lord if you'll
[15:04] save them people they won't act like
[15:06] that
[15:06] or they may not act much like that
[15:11] see how much prayer changed something
[15:14] matthew 6 verse 5 and when thou prayest
[15:17] thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are
[15:19] for they love to pray standing in the
[15:20] synagogues and in the corner of the
[15:21] streets
[15:22] that they may be seen of men
[15:25] i say unto you they have their reward
[15:28] but now when thou prayest enter into thy
[15:30] closet when thou hast shut the door
[15:32] pray to thy father which is in secret of
[15:34] thy father which seeth in secret shall
[15:35] we
[15:36] reward thee openly but when you pray use
[15:39] not vain repetition
[15:41] see that's a lot of times you that goes
[15:43] back to
[15:45] you look at the i've heard people pray a
[15:48] catholic prayer they just opened the
[15:49] book and they just start reading the
[15:50] prayer
[15:51] we were hunting in colorado and there
[15:53] was a girl she's really nice saying that
[15:55] to be a catholic she was the best i've
[15:56] ever seen close you know she was devout
[15:59] she said can i pray this prayer for you
[16:00] and i said oh sure
[16:02] prayer is good for anything so she opens
[16:04] up the book and prays the prayer of
[16:05] intercession for the saint of so and so
[16:07] that was a sign of travel
[16:09] well i thought well she's sincere
[16:14] but she may be sincerely wrong but
[16:16] that's what he said about no repetition
[16:17] don't just say lord bless these people
[16:19] and
[16:19] then the next day lord bless these
[16:20] people and you understand what i'm
[16:22] saying when we pray we should pray a new
[16:24] prayer
[16:25] that's what the bible says pray a new
[16:26] prayer may it be fresh let it not be
[16:28] repetition
[16:31] as the heathen do why because they chant
[16:34] to their god remember the heathens if
[16:35] you ever seen heathen worship they just
[16:37] continually chant one word or two words
[16:39] or something
[16:40] that's not we're trying to do with
[16:41] prayer to god
[16:43] for they think they shall be heard for
[16:45] their much speaking
[16:48] hmm use not vain repetition be not thou
[16:51] therefore like unto them for your father
[16:53] knoweth what things you have need of
[16:54] before you ask
[16:56] after this man and therefore pray our
[16:57] father which art in heaven hallowed be
[16:59] thy name that's what we were last week
[17:01] we'll not read that so now let's go to
[17:02] matthew 21
[17:05] verse 22 continue on and all things
[17:07] whatsoever you shall ask in prayer
[17:10] believing have you ever asked a prayer
[17:13] and said well i don't know if this is
[17:14] going to work or not but i'm going to
[17:15] pray anyway well now that's the wrong
[17:16] attitude to start with
[17:19] when you pray when you open your when
[17:20] you take your time
[17:22] to call on god make sure that you're
[17:25] sincere make sure that you're
[17:27] and i know the bible tells us to pray
[17:28] without ceasing and sure we might have
[17:30] the radio
[17:31] on and we may have a tape on it we may
[17:33] have something going on around the house
[17:35] but if you get an option to pray you
[17:37] just start praying right
[17:39] in other words conditions don't have to
[17:42] be perfect all the time
[17:43] but the prayer life that he's talking
[17:45] about up there in verse 6 and matthew
[17:47] that's when you say all right god i'm
[17:49] going to give you some prayer time
[17:51] i'm going to take in my closet you don't
[17:53] have to go in a closet you don't have to
[17:54] get down on your knees
[17:55] but you can just be sitting in your
[17:56] chair you're going to sit on your porch
[17:57] and then just open your heart up to god
[18:00] now that's you communicating with god to
[18:01] me i believe that's you talking to god
[18:03] about you
[18:06] you say oh no bro no you can ask god
[18:08] things about
[18:09] for you amen
[18:12] now watch for i barely say unto you mark
[18:16] 11
[18:16] 23 that whosoever shall say unto this
[18:18] mountain be thou removed
[18:20] be thou cast into the sea and shall not
[18:22] doubt in his heart
[18:23] but shall believe that those things
[18:24] which are saith shall come to pass
[18:27] he shall have whatsoever he saith
[18:29] therefore i say unto you what things so
[18:31] ever you desire
[18:33] when you pray believe that you receive
[18:36] them and you shall have them
[18:38] and when you stand praying forgive
[18:41] see that's what i said forgive ask
[18:43] forgiveness and forgive
[18:45] if you have odd against any that your
[18:47] father also which is in heaven may
[18:49] forgive you of your trespasses
[18:52] but if you do not forgive neither will
[18:54] your father which is in heaven forgive
[18:56] your trespasses all right let's go to
[18:59] john 17
[19:02] verse 9. i pray for them i pray not for
[19:04] the world
[19:05] but for them which thou has given me for
[19:07] they are thine
[19:09] acts 1 verse 14 this is where look these
[19:13] all continued with one accord what in
[19:15] prayer they were in they were in the
[19:16] upper room they were the holy ghost was
[19:18] falling on them
[19:19] and suffocation with the women marry the
[19:21] mother of jesus and with his brethren
[19:22] now acts 4 verse 31
[19:25] and when they had prayed the place was
[19:28] shaken where they were assembled
[19:30] together
[19:31] and they were all filled with the holy
[19:33] ghost and they spake with the
[19:35] fake the word of god with boldness
[19:38] wow when they had just prayed enter into
[19:42] a prayer
[19:44] i'd never done that before until i was
[19:45] in jamaica and we had a youth camp it's
[19:47] been five or six seven years ago
[19:49] and they asked me to speak at the youth
[19:50] camp and i told the brothers i said you
[19:53] just
[19:54] uh the song there lily of the valley
[19:56] where the bi
[19:57] the scripture said or the verse says
[19:59] there's a wall of fire around me well i
[20:01] told all i said if you got the holy
[20:02] ghost you just circle these young kids
[20:05] if you know how the holy ghost don't do
[20:06] it man if you've got the holy ghost you
[20:08] circle these
[20:09] young people and we started praying and
[20:12] we probably prayed for 30 minutes but
[20:13] god came down and filled a lot of people
[20:15] with the holy ghost
[20:16] and uh it wasn't laying on the hands or
[20:19] prayer line it was all just right there
[20:20] they were just in the sanctuary
[20:22] and man it was it was an awesome time
[20:25] that you just start pouring out your
[20:26] heart to god and it'll just start coming
[20:28] right it'll just start flowing amen
[20:31] romans 8 verse 26 likewise the spirit
[20:33] also helped with our infirmities
[20:35] for we know not what we should pray for
[20:37] as we ought in other words you don't
[20:39] know the outcome
[20:40] you don't know that that maybe aaron has
[20:43] just had a wreck in the car but aaron
[20:45] comes on your mind and then somebody
[20:46] comes on your mind about this and then
[20:48] somebody comes on your mind about this
[20:50] you don't need the details right right
[20:53] okay i you know you when you come up
[20:55] here for prayer you don't have to give
[20:57] the detail to the preacher
[20:58] you don't have to tell him what you've
[20:59] done three days ago and what led up to
[21:01] it
[21:02] tell them what you want prayed for and
[21:04] that's it
[21:06] all that other all that other is okay
[21:08] but the least i know the better
[21:10] i want to pray for what you need not
[21:12] what you did
[21:14] okay but that's what he's saying here
[21:16] but we know not what we should pray for
[21:17] as we all look but the spirit itself
[21:19] maketh intercession for
[21:21] us with groanings which cannot be
[21:23] uttered how many times have you done
[21:25] that though been sitting somewhere
[21:26] or be doing even at work and then all of
[21:28] a sudden an unction hits you to pray
[21:30] or somebody comes on your mind or
[21:32] something something you know
[21:34] something shakes you just start praying
[21:36] say lord i don't know who it is
[21:39] but it must be something that needs to
[21:41] be dealt with and you just stop and say
[21:43] a prayer there for just a moment
[21:45] look at verse first corinthians 11 verse
[21:48] 4
[21:50] every man praying or prophesying having
[21:52] his head covered dishonoreth his head
[21:54] but every woman that prayeth are
[21:56] prophesied with their head uncovered
[21:57] dishonored with her head
[21:59] for that is even all one as if she were
[22:01] shaven
[22:02] now i didn't bring the quote here but
[22:04] remember the quote where brother brown
[22:05] said
[22:05] god will not hear the prayer of a
[22:07] bob-haired woman except for her
[22:10] confession or forgiveness that's hard to
[22:13] see
[22:15] but that's what the bible says right
[22:16] here that's where he got it from brother
[22:18] brown didn't just bring it and say well
[22:19] this is a new doctrine
[22:20] if you pray with your hair cut god's not
[22:22] going to hear you
[22:24] that's what the bible says but every
[22:26] woman that pray after prophesies with
[22:28] her head uncovered and we ain't talking
[22:29] about a hat
[22:30] talk about cutting your hair dishonoring
[22:32] her head now who's her head sure husband
[22:34] but her head is christ
[22:36] for that is even as one as if she were
[22:39] shaven now look at first corinthians 11
[22:42] verse
[22:42] 13 he continues on says judge in
[22:45] yourself
[22:46] is it comely that a woman pray unto god
[22:48] uncovered
[22:50] and it's not now he can hear prayer of
[22:53] intercession for
[22:54] you for forgiveness
[22:57] but now too you got to remember what he
[22:59] just said about the men too
[23:02] you know so be careful man we can't have
[23:04] a hair drink
[23:05] dragging the ground because the bible
[23:07] says every man praying having his head
[23:09] covered dishonest his head
[23:10] in other words if he got long hair and
[23:13] won it that way
[23:14] all right so now let's go and read this
[23:16] next one
[23:18] in first timothy four verse four if you
[23:20] musicians come on
[23:23] rejoice ever more first thessalonians
[23:27] i'm sorry
[23:28] brothers 5 16 rejoice evermore pray
[23:31] without ceasing
[23:33] in everything give thanks come on in
[23:35] everything give thanks
[23:38] for this is the will of god in christ
[23:41] concerning you there's the will of god
[23:43] what pray without ceasing
[23:45] first timothy 4 verse 4 we'll stop right
[23:47] there and every creature of god is good
[23:49] and nothing to be refused
[23:51] if it be received with thanksgiving what
[23:53] he's talking about eating
[23:54] for it is sanctified by the word of god
[23:58] and by prayer amen god bless you
[24:03] we'll uh start right there next next
[24:06] week
[24:10] pray without ceasing how do you do that
[24:15] start talking to god god bless you
