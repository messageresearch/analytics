TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I know I put this book together very quickly this morning so I was in heaven nothing best nervous it wasn't there I thought my gosh wait what's that did you go home that's right so this morning I want to start off by doing something a little different I want to um you know we tell him to talk about this morning the marriage of the lamb with the whole purpose of what's been going on through the seven churches and what's been going over our individual losses that we're being go through the process of marriage to Jesus Christ and part of that part of that is that you the bride isn't making herself ready there's there's something that groom as a dude or something that the bride has to do and the bride's role is to make yourself ready so to make yourself ready you got to eat the word right you have to have a relationship with God and so I wanted to spend a few minutes talking about how to make you separate but you know years ago the message was on real burials and and it was very comes had to load up that reel and and of course I don't know all the things that went into that so you know it as time goes on it gets easier and easier to get into the message I remember when uh when his name mispronounces he they came out with that little little thing where you could see all the messages all of them on that little tiny little device with that little screen and you could search and everything and people yeah the e-book and uh and so now we're even come along further than that but a lot of people don't realize how easy it is you know you almost you know you've got all these books and things on your shelf and you don't have to necessarily I mean I still like to have a book that you pull out and it's got highlighted and everything but you don't have to do that so I think everybody just about has a computer and inside this more to share with you real quick if you go to Branham that over which is the voice of God website and then go up to the top of the page here and click home multimedia apps click on apps right there and they've got some apps that you can download and one of them is this neat table app now this is a little leap so to get it on your computer you just click on Windows and it downloads this little program that you can see here in my and my Google Chrome tray and you just run this program and it installs it and if you need any help if you got a laptop or whatever and you want to get this on your computer any of these brothers around here myself included would be glad to help you get it installed and so this is a little slimmed down version of that on that app that you can get on your phone which in fact does basically the same thing you think about how amazing that is you can have all the messages on your phone and if you've got any downtime you can just pull up your phone and you something pops in you buy one for I'm sad about this and you go search it in and and you know it's very important for ministers to have something that you can search but also for this antibody to be able to search and check things out and and and make sure that you know keep your own little library of things that you find interesting or whatever so so this app if you when you open it up it looks like this Wow every single message is right there and you all you have to do is just click through you can find a message by the time that brother man preached you find it oh you know I buy the location you click this little search icon and you click there and you can find all the all the times brother Grimson predestinate or predestinated or participates and go through and see everything that he's said and then even you know click over here and you can you select words and then you can highlight you know keep your own little little record of things categories that you create you know what's really amazing is that they have taken their they once of God has done is they've taken the when they when they send this over to see store the translators and the reason I know this has come up my father knows that is a translator for Romania and they mark up all of these paragraphs with a little you know each and you can see how they as you highlighted it it note it's got these little ranges so you can click anywhere in this software and just start playing if you want to hear how exactly brother branham saying it just click it and play it and it starts playing right there and how amazing is that so I'm just I just wanted to share that with you because a lot of people are not aware that that is that's available and that you can really dig into the message and find out what the rim say for yourself and keep your own little catalog of you know I sometimes with my wife and I obviously you know put in something here like like adoption or predestinate something like that and just go through brother Evan said about it and read it one at a time and and you can even see in it and have the progression of the thought from the beginning of the ministry all the way through kinda helps put things in context gives you you know you can you can see how how brother Brennan framed it in early early in the ministry how the continuity of it goes all the way through the whole message and I think one of the things that's kind of surprising is how how the little brother branham did change things from the beginning that you know he may be able to he expressed adoption and things a little bit differently then you did later on the ministry but it's an unchanging message so anyway I just want to share that week and now let's go on into the topic the marriage of the Lamb but before I do that is they might have any questions about software how to get something anything like that it's pretty cool just to listen to messages to type it up and then push play if I don't have been in my life already pushed down load it down with my probably a minute yes yeah it's fantastic and then they also have this this this is the really powerful software that a lot of people use that that that you can order from the element it comes on the CDs and you can load it up and this allows you to do fantastic things like if I if I want you DEP see I was doing a little complex search right there you can search for predestinate and it put a little star on the end of it and it'll search for predestinate pretty studied in it'll do standing on it so you can if you don't know exactly how brother I'm said it you just put that little a trick in there and you can do some really powerful searches and that's not available with that little slate down software and then you can search for phrases you can do phrase and then have another word that he might have searched said and so it really helps to find things all right so the marriage of the labor you know the marriage of the lamb is is something that like I said it's something that's taking place where God is peace he's uniting himself with the bride that has been chosen has been pulled out of all of the denominational systems and been United with him and there's a process that takes place if you look at really I want to talk this morning about the Jewish wedding the traditional Jewish wedding all the things that go into that but if you look at how the wedding takes place that is mirrored in the church and so one of the things we're talking about isn't it the green has some things that he's got to do and the bride has some things that she has to be there's some some parts that she has to play in one of those things that she has to get ready so that's why I was sharing with you how to get ready how to go dig into the word for yourself was one of the things that the bride doesn't get her separator she goes to church she studies he reads the Bible from herself all those things make up getting ready I'm gonna start off I don't know where that that word glory came from that's just now notice that almost the copied and pasted that somewhere else but anyway so in Genesis chapter 6 it talks about that the the daughters their sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they joined themselves to me they got they got married they took them wives which they chose and they joined themselves based on them they you know brother Graham talk about how they're the sons of God or not it wasn't that the angels came down and doing themselves to the to the dollar to mean because it's about angel does not have any and I'm not only there's no they're not male or female like that so that couldn't have been that and in these so these these were sons of God descendants from Adam that that instead of instead of finding somebody that believed the same thing that they did they wanted to give themselves unequally and the reason what they did was they were looking for somebody that that appeased the outside man somebody that you know dollars are men like Jezebel they may you know fix them fix up their outward appearance showing too much skin problem paired in a way that will be unseemly to attract somebody like that but a real son of God it won't be it shouldn't be attracted as things like that and you can see how this this Union got off it this Union was incorrect and the God's going to join himself to a bride that he's looking for somebody that has the right character the right the right thing to make to you so that he can heal himself equally you see and so what territory is looking for is the character of himself that's how he's choosing he's choosing something that he's choosing a bride that expresses the same thing the same attributes that are in him and so how do we come to a wedding in Matthew 19 with a very famous scripture that we were from anywhere the the Pharisees came to him tempting him and he answered instead of a I mean I did not read that he which he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh one flesh just like Adam and Eve or one flesh following his bone everything matched up word just like the bride and Christ's word word matching up the spirit the same spirit the same Holy Ghost those in Jesus's and the bride everything matches up they see swear for there are no more Twain but one flesh what they're for together let not man put asunder so I if a man and a woman gets bared and it's truly a guardian to governments join them together let not man put that thing asunder the same thing with a bride when the bride and Christ are joined together it's not something that has been produced by man but God has done that work let not man put asunder and then in Matthew chapter 22 sorry Jesus is talking about the wedding so let's just read this one just I'll just take my time and go through some of these scriptures the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain King which made a marriage for his son and sent forth his servants to calling that were bidden to the way and they would not come again he set forth other servants saying tell them which are bidden behold I prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are killed and all things are ready come under the marriage and I will show you in a slide I second all the things that go into a biblical wedding and one of the things that goes into is there's the invitation there's the invitation that come there's a lot of things that go there's got to be a groom a bride and the invitation and a port a porter a door of wedding garment all those things are going to make it of the wedding and then the first thing is that invitation you can't have a wedding without the groom saying we were you marry to me and that's what when you come to church you hear that invitation as the minister about how the pulpit is preaching the gospel he says will you be joined to this man will you take this man and when you when you're saved you're receiving that invitation you see I will and he said but they made a lot of it and went their ways one to his farm another to his merchandise and the rim that took his servants and entreated them spitefully and slew him but when the king heard thereof he was wroth and he sent forth his armies to destroy those murder burned up their city then saith each of the service waiting is ready but they which were bidden were not worth worthy good are you therefore into the highways and as many as you shall find bid to the marriage so those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests and when the king came in to see the guests he saw there a man which had no wedding garment now you see that's another thing that the bride has to do when she comes to the wedding she can't just come up there dress like she just came from the kitchen she's got to come with a wedding dress on she can't just come any other way she's got to come with the veil with the wedding dress with the wedding garment so she's gotta have a wedding garment you see and he saved them to them Freddie how came is down being together not having a wedding garment and he was speechless now that's important thing I want to point out he was speechless because if you're speechless that means you don't know you don't have no understanding you don't have nothing to say 'no bride and this day is supposed to have an understanding of awareness of what she's what she's doing here she's that she's heard the word and she understands she has knowledge she's been adopted she knows exactly what the message is taken to her and she has a voice because I believe that the voice of God is in the bride she's able to speak like Esther did when she went into the Kings she was able to speak and anything and explain and so this person here is speechless they don't have a clue they don't know they don't unable to give a reason they're unable to say well I didn't do it because of them so because of that they're not I'm not able to explain anything then said the King to the servants bind him hand and foot and take him away cast him out into outer darkness there shall be weeping gnashing of teeth for many are called but few are chosen and I have a quote I'll show you gonna hit a little bit about what brother branham explained about it come on me and brother that that is a that is a very horrible condition to realize to get to the place to realize where that you should have been eating of the word you should have been preparing yourself and you get to the place where the bride is called to the wedding feast the Trump of the Lord sounds and you're you're not ready and to get to come to that place and there'll be a foolish virgin one day there realizes oops I should have been eaten I should have been making myself ready and now I don't have the wedding garment and so it says it would be cast into outer darkness and there should be weeping and gnashing of teeth for many are called but few are chosen of course we know this future in the revelation this is really what I'm talking about the marriage of the land that says and I heard it as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of meeting waters and the voice of mighty thunderings saying how about say hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honour together for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready the time has come for them to be joined for them for her to be taken out for all the things that are all that all the biblical types and everything to be fulfilled and when the marriage of the lamb has come the wife has made herself free she comes up she's been washed she's been cleaned she's wearing a white garment she's got all of the things all things are set in order the way that they're supposed to be the groom has done his part and the bride has done her part into her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he say them to me write blessed are they which are called under the marriage the land many say that I mean these are the true sayings of God so let's look at the parts of the Spirit joining this is what I'm just gonna I'm just going to go through each of these this morning first you got a engine invitation then you've got this thing in the Jewish wedding call it a tuba what is like a tuba we'll look at that for a second then you got a porter somebody's gotta open the door there's the door which we know is Christ somebody's got to be standing there opening the door and and I'm gonna the porter sit down to reach seven church ladies you got us a church a messenger that opens the door and everybody that's in their denominational system can go through the door and come out of that age but you also got ministers cuz you gotta have a wedding you look let's just be really a first thing you can't just put on the tape or something and play a recording and have a wedding ceremony you gotta have a minister standing there that can say things like like is there anybody here that knows any impediment why these two cannot be joined then when you have a wedding you got to make sure there's no impediment there's no reason why you can't be joined together that's why many people don't get the baptism you all a ghost because there's a reason why you can't be joined together the reason might be that you ain't justified you can't be joined together if you're not justified you can't be joined together if you're not sanctified because there's a reason why you can't be joined together but if all of those reasons are out of the way then you can be joined together and you see if so if you come to a wedding and the natural wedding like just two people come to church and and somebody you ask that question somebody stands up well they got a live-in husband well see then the husband that you were you were doing to previously is not dead so there's a reason why you can't be doing the end of it you see so so we got the porter of the door the groom the groom has to play this role the bride you got a gardener and you got a tuba which is the canopy the tuba is this thing in the Jewish wedding that that the bride and the groom will stand under and they they they make their wedding vows under this canopy and you've got to have that canopy to have a spiritual wedding you got to have that place for you to stand under and make your vows and then you have the supper and then the most important part of all from a real spiritual way is love because how are you gonna have a wedding if you don't have a relationship to begin with you gotta have love otherwise you're just going through somebody some stuff and and it just messes everything up if the whole relationship is not based on love in fact there's no there's no relationship at all of that look you've got to have a relationship with God yes that's that's the whole that's the kind of keeping the whole thing so first of all you got to have the invitation in Matthew 24 says in this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the income the engine come when the invitation has been sent to everybody in the world everybody here's the invitation that's one of the criteria for the easy mark 16 says and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature to all the world and that's what happened after after their death Pentecost they stayed around in Jerusalem for a little bit and then a prophet came on the scene I forget his name what nanan eyes but he said he talked about that Titus was gonna come in and destroy the city and so everybody dispersed and then begin to go into all the world when I went to India I forget which one which ones went to different places some went to the England somewhere in two different places and they took the gospel into all the world to preach that invitation to come to the waiting sir Peter believe that is baptized shall be saved say but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe we know all these these promises that of the church that works we'll follow their faith when verse 20 says and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with worthless silence following and look for 14 eight through twelve says when they are bidden of any man to a wedding sitting up down in the highest room lest the more honorable man then thou be bidden of him and this is talking about me you've been to the feast in your own self don't try to make yourself up high but keep real humble so that God can build you up with these virtues so that God can can mold you into his image and either faith in him come and say that they give this men place and now begin with shame to take the lowest ring then when that aren't bidden go and sit down in the lowest room that when again had been made thee cometh you may say to thee friend go up higher and higher higher is going to take you all the way to the wedding supper and then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sat at meat with thee from whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted so when you're bidding bidden to the when you're invited to the wedding feast accept the invitation with humility and meekness so that you can you so that God can work and work something in you to take you up higher all right so we're talking about the invitation now let me read this list I know we're all for me with this story that program total of the the armored meat packing this story which is a true story it actually happened that the son of one of the men of the armored meat packing he or aunt was actually one of the the foreman of the ranch where the armored meat packing folks had that ranch he he went out and wanted to choose a bride and so program tells the story of the of the choosing of of this man's bride and it compares to how God chooses a bride and if you notice when you look at the story they start off maybe maybe that ranch foreman was dressed up in jeans and and the little girl was was you know she was down on her knees just cleaning the floor or maybe looked all dirty and everything for example just like Rahab just like the woman at the whale started off not dressed far away the man was just come out there wanting to talk to her and everything but then at the end of the story she's dressed she's got a wedding on she's ready for the wedding and he comes riding in with his coach I've said like in a tuxedo he's ready for the wedding - so there's a transformation that takes place through this story the transformation is she's made herself ready and he's got everything prepared he's got her home ready he's done his part he's played this role the so everybody's got their role that they've got a play so he says it reminds me of a little story I might say it before we go on out west here some time ago many years there was this great armour and Swift packing company how they do they come out there buy cattle and buy ranches and they're worth a lot of money about all the small ranches that have millions of acres of ranch like that run these being finally here for cattle in sections their own they own their own railroads and things that brings in kalamoon to another and armor and Swift had a big ranch and one day they had a forum in there the superintendent it was of the ranch he had about four or five dollars and they found out that one of the big armor brothers was or not brothers but sons were going to visit the ranch that he was a young single man and all these girls yeah for sure that was going to vamp this boy as soon as he could see how that ties into that Genesis scripture I read where they the sons of God chose the daughters of me and they chose girls that were vamping but so here these girls thought they were gonna ban this boy like Jezebel trying to evaluate him when he was coming riding on his horse and so they was always getting ready and making sure making everything ready to come when he got there then was going to meet him and put on an old frontier day with their little dresses on with a fringe on it and 45:44 is on each hip and then them hats on the back of their head you know they was going to be regular Westerners and each one of the girls was going to get one of them was going to get this boy and they had a little cousin there that her mother was dead and the father was dead she was a cousin that she almost was the slave doll that was there and all the dirty work she had to do it washing the dishes and everything but she had no clothes she had to take hand-me-downs and so in the time come that the board was to arrive they all got in their book boards and a way down to the station and went to receiving and they were shooting the guns and the horses nicker in and everything and they brought him out to the ranch and that night they had a big shindig and they got out there on the haystacks and the Kuril fence Corral fence and they sang and they danced and all through the night he was there for two or three days so they wasn't dressed for a wedding they were dressed for a Western shindig you see so this is a little girl she had all the rough work to do so when Allah wants the ball of one night was something was over and they had dances and each one of these little girls had printed it up you know and this poor little girl had to have a little ragged dress on and one night she was sitting in the mess hall after the supper was over and she had washed the dishes and she run out through the backyard to throw the dishwasher the water out when she turned around the corral fence there he stood leaning at the corral fence he said hello she was say now think about that when first time you've heard that gospel call first time you saw somebody manifest the life of Christ that God telling you hello she was so ashamed because that was the superintendent's boy the son of the owner of the ranch she held the dish pinned down so he wouldn't notice her so ragged started backing off with her bare feet looking back like this man walked up to her said don't be afraid of me said I want to tell you something he said I come out of here for one purpose I come home to find a wife I said I've been looking everywhere said I didn't want to marry any of the girls back there in the city I want to get what I thought was a real life it said of all that I was seeking I've been noticing you around here and I found out through some of the hands that your cousin said that's right sir I want to ask you something will you marry me why she didn't know what she was so descent she didn't know how to answer the man and so he's issues that invitation whether you marry me and in the Old Testament what they would do is they would sit down they would have when they made an arrangement to get married they would do go through this ceremony called the ketubah the groom would come to the parents and-and-and he would write down everything that he's gonna do to provide for this girl he would write it all down to make sure there was no misunderstanding he would write a written promise and he was they would seal it with witnesses everybody would be around okay I see you writing this and then and what was included in the ketubah was a promise that he would close her that he would feed her and then he would give her seed that he would give her children that she would produce a child for him he that was all written in that promise but so the bride the bride's role she really don't have to do too much all she has to do is accept the proposal do you think about the responsibilities of the groomers are to provide he's got provide the food but all the wife has to do is just accept and trust him she don't have to provide as he is his written promise that he will provide he's the one that provides and so they they wrote this this this promise down seal it up when the mouth and when the witnesses and then under that chew to poo they were breaking open when the wedding was was under that covering but right there when they would say their vows they would open that up and it would be read in public so you think think about how this compares with the seals how God wrote his promises who wrote his promises down and sealed it up and waited until the whole process was completed wait to the end and then you can open it up and say this is the one this is how I saved her this is how I did it it was already written and the bride maybe didn't even realize that that until she got up there that all those things that God had promised that he's achieved she was always on his mind from the foundation of the world God had thought about I heard written all those things down then you get under that Tituba under the covering of the Lord and the wedding the wedding vows are broken open and read so that everybody knows what what his thoughts of her were from the beginning the Revelation chapter tore brother and said well I just imagine how she felt don't you when me a sinner wants no good for nothing and drunkards John Jesus Christ I won't use for mine how could he ever come to somebody like me how could he ever say I'll give you a home in heaven how could he ever say I'll save you such a rich isn't me how could it ever be but he did it she said sir I'm not worthy I couldn't make a wife to a man like you said because you are used to green things and I nothing about them up or he said but you are my choice and it wasn't nice when Jesus told you that you know you wasn't worthy to be a Christian you there wasn't nothing you could ever do but he just chose you it's his business goodness his mercy that he chose you you didn't choose him you know he chose you that's right don't look at your clothes I don't look at your clothes I look at what you are he said will you marry me and finally the agreement was made the agreement look at to put was made and he said one year from this day I will return you realize how perfect the messages he probably he probably didn't even realize exactly how he was framing that but that is absolutely biblical the agreement was made the ketubah was made she acted and had to follow the biblical pattern and he said one year from this date I don't return you'd be ready have the wedding your arm at home so I will return and marry you right here on these grounds and I'll take you to Chicago that I would drive there well you have a castle to live in and all this dishwashing will be over and things leave so then we got a porter you gotta have a message you can have a minister to join the two together in mark 13 and many other scriptures talk about how you have a mourner to watch that does the other scripture that talks about there's a porter standing in the door to open and the porter job is to close with you with that raiment to get you ready to priest or so the bride is ready the unpardonable sin brother Graham said the bridegroom in the audience today the bridegroom sets the wedding supper and when he did is up to him to furnish the room the bride the bride all she has to do is show up it's the groom's responsibility to provide and give her food clothing children all of that Jesus Christ centered the wedding supper at the end of the life and it's up to him to furnish the preparation of the robes and at the door the porter as it was with his close friends stood there and every man they come up with a ticket got the same kind of road they put it on him if he was in rags or if he was in Brawl cloth just the same you were the Rope cause he looked just exactly like the rest of them that's exactly right and so we know how that the the RO the garment was speaking of the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's his righteousness not ours but so then you have a door the door to get in to the way the door he said I am the door the Sheep the duck the porter stands at the door getting you clothed so that you can go into the door he said I am the door I think I've already read that but so the bride's the bride's responsibility is to launch yourself when you come when you come to a wedding she's gonna come washed in the water of the word may any are her hair done and everything the veil clothed clothed in the righteousness of God so that she can stand when the whiteness of that of that white dress showing that she's absolutely righteous not any kind of spot or anything ready to take those vials revelation 19:7 says let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready of course if there's a lot of people that that say they're in the bride but they're not making themselves ready that's the foolish virgin they will realize that they're foolish right there at the end they're foolish because they they didn't do what was necessary to prepare themselves so we talked also about how when you come to a wedding you got to make those because the minister has to make that declaration any reason why these two can't be joined together because the first husband can't be dead now the first doesn't has to be dated the first husband where you were joined to the to your denominational ideas your own thoughts all those things that all that has to be done away with there's quotes for brother I set up you know you what happens is you still carry on if you come out of denominational systems you care to carry on some of those ideas and things about how the Baptist said that well as soon as you get baptized and you're born again you that's going to die although all those ideas and things that they presented her only incorrectly has to die so that you can receive the word so to be married to the second Adam Christ the word you must separate yourself by death from your first denominational husband because there isn't a one of them that can take all the Word of God and then I just put this quote in here from a wedding ceremony that brother Graham did where he asked that question if there's anyone here they can show it just cause while they should not be lawful joined in this holy matrimony let them now speak or forever hold their peace you know a lot of modern wedding planners they take that out but they're like well you know that it's almost lost this the sanctity the wedding vows you know people almost look at weddings it's something that's not going to last forever but this wedding is supposed to be forever you're supposed to come into it soberly and prayerfully and you spiritually you can't get married you cannot get the best of the Holy Ghost there's any reason why you can't be joined together now the wedding government so when you come to the come to the end you got to be clothed in his righteousness what do you think when the bride would come back and find a man is sitting there without a wedding garment on and he talks about how that now Jesus said this himself he called her the porter he said binding that foot in hand and he was cast out into outer darkness where they'll be weeping wailing and gnashing teeth that's Christ's own word right he was that's down because it proved without the wedding garment he comes some other way besides the door if he would have come by the door he would have received a wedding garment oh listen to this then if the wedding garment is the baptism in the Holy Spirit how are we going to be represented any other way then he keeps on going so let's pick the hope who would be found without the wedding garment let's look at brother brems explanation for this and Jeff over John in 1964 he said the Bible said when they come said give us some of your own they said the sleeping version there they realized they could have had all that time to get old but they didn't do so when the bridegroom was just about to come they said give us some of your all they said we just got enough for ourselves you go buy from them that sale and while they were gone the bribery come and the bride went in and they were cast into outer darkness what's outer darkness in this case to wake up and find out the rapture was gone and there and they were left where they will be weeping and wailing the Tribulation Period and gnashing of teeth and he goes on to say if you haven't got the Holy Spirit open Victor enough to know that you should have it would you raise up your hand and he's giving that invitation again to the wedding sir so then you've got a minister Peter Paul talked about how he espoused the church he said for I am jealous over you with godly jealousy for I have a spouse you know one husband and I'm a present you as a chaste virgin to Christ he's because if you gotta have a minute to do that when to perform that wedding ceremony and then you gotta have it to the to pose the canopy and this it's strong number it talks about what the definition for that to pray is a chamber a room the canopy a closet thinking with all the spiritual applications with it that is it's divine protection where you get under that chupa and in God's like like bow has a skirt over roof trying to reach for a name so that you pull looks like this you get under that they're not a monitor coupon that they were the minister and the bride and the groom was standing to this and and they would make their wedding vows and you could see this in the scripture in Joel chapter 2 verse 16 that says to gather the people sanctify the congregation a simple the elders gathered the children and those the signa breasts let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber and the bride out of the closet and that word falls it in the hebrew it's it's that word shoot the bride so we've got chambers and clauses and all of this is signifying a real relationship between the bride and the groom psalm 19 says that their line is going out through all the earth and their worst the end of the world and then Hathi set a tabernacle for the Sun which is a as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race there's that to work cheap again coming out of his chamber that is a ten covering like like in roof he said who are thou she answered I am Ruth I had me spread therefore thigh skirt over that hen me for thou art a near kinsman because this covering or the ten shows a protection of divine protection that he is that they're in a special relationship with one another he's going to take care of her and the waters of separation brother Brown talks about this you know you can follow this pattern Oppel through the message Butler talks about the kitchen the kitchen is where you eat after you come and eat like the church you set on the beach and hear the word faith comes by hearing then after you've eaten the word then you come into the living room which is in the fellowship with the rest of the church but then after that the secret place or this to the secret place is the bedroom where you go in and kneel down where you a bunch of you man B's used to a long time ago go in there and pray for your children when they was out at night so the chupa is getting into a relationship with God whether it's love the love is what happens in the children something special is going on that's that's private that's not not even really visible to anyone outside nobody knows what's going on in the chupa but the bride and the groom you see my hidden life program said that every man that stays in the presence of God into this great secret place hid away will yield the fruits of righteousness Peace Love joy long-suffering goodness gentleness patience don't fuss about these other things get that in your life and you'll never get until you hide away with God into that land of adoption see if I can finish on the next couple of slides let's let's get down to e 25 he said no no every year that a priest entered into that place - congregation followed him up and when he went into this great place where the veil dropped behind him talking about the high priest the intercourse the holiness of points no one there to go after them then he was alone with God what a beautiful picture is today of a consecrated life who once enters into with Christ dead to the things of the world get away with God and the veils drop down around and all the world shut off within Christianity and religion becomes a pleasure to every believer so there's that children which is a time and I'm going to hurry through these last couple of slides that that tent of meeting the tabernacle you go into the holiest of Holies and as you and God alone through that you come through the parlor into the kitchen only into the that's thinking and that compare is on into if you if you look at all the feast days that you have gone all the way down through the seven churches off compare all the feasts you end up with this feast of tabernacles a tabernacle a little tent where you go in there and you eat you eat a meal the meal was prepared there's so many things you can look at here but this is just kind of an outline of where the feast of tabernacles falls for those last feast at the end of the year the Feast of Trumpets the Day of Atonement and then the feast of tabernacles Falls for seven days where they eat inside of that covering that losses that they made and then you have the supper see that that eating inside of that Tabernacle folder right into the summer and we'll just we'll stop right there cuz I've run out of time [Music]
