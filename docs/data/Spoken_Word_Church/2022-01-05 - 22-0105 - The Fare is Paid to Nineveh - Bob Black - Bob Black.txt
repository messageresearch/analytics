you want to see him tonight let's go ahead and turn over in the book of jonah this is really one of my favorite books in the bible because uh it's there's it speaks of hope when you're when you're way down and and there's somebody you can turn to in time of trouble and confidence and delivery and all those kind of things so we'll read a little a little take a little thought from from the book of jonah the fair is paid to nineveh let's go to the lord in prayer lord god we're so grateful to be able to gather together around your word this this this afternoon lord in the middle of the week lord jesus and we just look to you for encouragement and helping this our lord god we're living in lord i pray lord that you'll open up the words lord as we read and dive into these things lord jesus that you'll open up the true interpretation of these scriptures lord jesus that we could we can probe that with our mind with our intellectual reasoning lord but it takes the power of the holy ghost to come and put things together into a revelation lord jesus so that everything fits properly lord that it gives us power in this hour lord jesus we pray lord that you'll just feel the liberty lord to move among us lord jesus and speak to the knees and help those that are in trouble and in in low places little god that you'll lift us up and encourage us tonight lord jesus granted lord did you just be at liberty to help us lord and move among us lord as we look to you the author and the finisher of our faith lord with faith believing lord god that you are a rewarder of those that diligently seek you we ask your blessing upon the word now in the name of the lord jesus christ now this is a story we're all familiar with so we'll just read the first three verses here and it says now the word of the lord came unto jonah the son of hematite saying arise and go to nineveh so the lord's telling jonah what he wants him to do go to nineveh that great city and cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me but jonah rose up to flee unto tarshish from the presence of the lord and went down to joppa and he found a ship going to tarshish so he paid the fare thereof and went down into it to go with them unto tarshish from the presence of the lord you may be seated the lord is a blessing to the reading of the word so jonah had jonah was presented like like every every believer every christian is today he was presented with two choices he was presented with a choice to go to nineveh to go to up to nineveh or to go to tarshish now you know brother branham always made the point when when there's a fly up here we're just going to press home you know the the devil likes to bother you sometimes but uh brother brown always made the distinction about jonah that that when jonah he had that uh when he when he made the decision to go to tarshish instead instead of going to nineveh that he he wasn't backslid now so we want to make that distinction here and just kind of set on that for a little bit and talk about it that jonah was not because he went to tarsus he wasn't backslid now in other words because he went to tarsus he wasn't he didn't stop going to church he didn't he didn't you know decide i'm going to go down to the pool hall and i'm going to get drunk and he didn't he he he he you know you look at and brother brown will make a point of reading in that the chapter where uh he down in the belly of the well he began to cry out to god i i know that if i turn and toward toward the temple and and pray that i've got confidence that you'll answer so jonah wasn't backslid and you know brother brown said uh we always talk so much about being a bachelor and everything he said i've always took up for jonah i did not believe that jonah was backslid of course backslidden means relapsing into bad ways or errors just to slide back into stuff that you know you ain't supposed to be doing to slide back and that that's why you know you you can look at the way that a christian's living and said well that that's not right you know what a christian is a christian supposed to be going to church and spoke supposed to be living right and doing right because when you're not you're you're backslid now he said many people condemn jonah and say well he was an old backslider he wasn't backslid a man of god the steps the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of the lord now you think about what brother brown is saying there when he's talking about that jonah wasn't backslid that what in other words jonah is living out a story he had to live out a story he had to go through this thing that one day jesus would be preaching and he he would be telling everybody as jonah was went down in the belly of the well for three days so almost the son of man would go down and and so even so a story that even now tonight i can preach on this and many other ministers down through the ages have preached on this same story taking examples out of this so he had to he had to live out a story because so god could make his his will manifest so we could see so we could observe so we can know he and the whole thing the whole thing was god was ordering his footsteps so that one day he could come out of that belly of the well to and preach to a people that worshiped a fish god they gone come out of that thing and they would see him coming out of there and and and preach like preach like a a house on fire on a windy day and save and deliver those people the whole thing was ordered of the lord now it might have looked you know jonah went through he had to go through a lot of a lot of rough times as this story unfolds it was it was really rough on him all the things that he had to endure the storm coming up and the casting lots and them saying i'm the one that they're casting lots for and and then then finally coming he's the one that's identified as the problem and they got to throw him overboard and up from the deep and the in the dead of night up from the deep comes there's a there's a i think there's a a fear of things in the deep ocean called thalassophobia the fear you think about something something in the deep ocean something coming up to get you and this thing that god had created for this special purpose came up to get him and and saved him and delivered him he was down in the belly of that thing for three days and three nights crying out to god his prayer was i lord i'm i'm in the bowels of hell the earth is swallowing me up all the the the frame of the earth is all around me and finally he was vomited up on the shore to go witness to the people now so but he wasn't he wasn't backslid he was a believer the whole time he was staying true to his calling my brother said the principle reason that i believe that he did this great thing here was because now now listen to this the reason why tar jonah went to tarshish the reason why jonathan went to tarsus he said the reason that he did this was because jonah was a jew and he was asked to go to a gentile city to cry out against it thinking that he would not be received so now the reason i've heard people preach on this before and they say that they would say that jonah was a jew and he didn't want to go preach to the gentiles that's not the point that he's trying to make he's trying to make the point that he had he had a responsibility that god had given to him and he was afraid that people would not listen to him he was afraid of what people's reaction to him would be if you think about maybe tonight how many people are afraid of what people will think if they raise their hand or afraid what they'll think if they testify are afraid what they people will think if they go to work and and tell people that they're a christian and afraid that if they dress right or do right that somebody what somebody will think and and you see jonah was he he said he was thinking that he would not be received because the gentiles would think what's this jew got to do with us what's this jew got to do with he was afraid of what other people would think and you brother brahm said you see it gives us a great thing here to see that god not only is god of the jew but he's god also of the gentile he is god of all people now you think about how that god they're they're jonah was given a commission to go preach to people that wasn't like him the deal preached to the gentile people and you know such a such a fantastic type that god is concerned about people all over the world he he wants to save anybody that will listen to him and maybe maybe jonah got hung up a little bit on that maybe maybe he was afraid of what they would what they would think because he he you know he knew that they didn't have all the background maybe all the teaching didn't come from all the the historicity and everything of the jews that didn't understand who abraham was and all them things but yet god is a god that loves he wants everybody to be saved he wants he wants the whole world to be saved that's why that scripture that we read so often john 3 in john 3 16 john 3 15 if you go back to 15 it says whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life and then it's so important that god jesus repeated it again in verse 16 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life have you ever noticed that before that it's repeated twice that he says it twice because it's so important that he loves he he wants everybody to be saved you got god made a way for everybody to be saved if you if you if you can believe it it's how strange today that in this hour that we're living in that is such a doctrine that that people that they want to place bands around god's grace they want to put bam people want to put bands around god's grace and say that only a certain people can be saved only only some if if you fall in the right category if you're now if you're not holy enough you can't be saved or if you're not born right you can't be saved here if your mama and daddy ain't just right if their situation just ain't just right then you can't be saved or if if you're not if you're not worthy in some way something that you didn't do just right then you can't be saved but you see the gospel preached and the truth open tears off the bands of it so that the so that you can have confidence you can have freedom that god wants to save you it doesn't matter what your background is it doesn't matter if you came from nineveh or tarsus or joppa or wherever god wants to save you and brother brown said that jesus was he was trying to show he said jesus was jesus was the jews were chosen he said he ju he chose the jews let me slow down so i can talk he chose to choose the jews was called god's chosen people and they were chosen for a specific cause that we're talking about grace grace now the grace to everybody and he said that cause was to give them the law and they could not keep it you think about that's the reason why he chose the jews now i know there's a you could go into all the different reasons why he chose the jews but th this is the this is what we're honing in on tonight though that he chose the jews to prove a people a people that were chosen to prove to everybody to prove to the world that you can't keep it that you can't you try to keep the law you try to do all the things that are required by the law and you're going to fall short somewhere he said that cause was to give them the law and they could not keep it the reason the cause was to show that they could not keep it and he and he he just showed by that people that the law could not be kept and that he was a god of righteousness and the law demanded righteousness but there was no grace in law to bring a man out no penalty was paid by the law but it taken grace to pay that penalty uh to where the law put us under grace in second corinthians jesus told christ told paul he said unto me my grace is sufficient for me my grace what a message that we have of grace that when we fall short there's grace to us that god has given us his grace it's so difficult for us to show grace to one another even but if you can see the grace of god that has been extended to you then you can show grace to others in ephesians chapter 2 it says but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead and sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace are you saved by grace are you saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace his grace and his kindness toward us through christ jesus for by grace are you saved through faith it's his gracious gift you didn't deserve it grace is a gift that you didn't do nothing to deserve it he just give it to you it says grace and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god he said not of works lest any man should boast you didn't do one thing to earn it you weren't born by you didn't have you didn't have to satisfy some requirement that your parents were born a certain way or do something you didn't have to do not one thing to get this gift but it was his grace that gave it to you all you got to do is believe in for it's by grace are you saved through faith faith for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath hath before ordained that we should walk in him you so so exhibit a will say exhibit a that you can't keep the law is the jews the jews sitting there going through all of the history that they have exhibit a you can look at the jews and say you can't keep it there's nothing that you can do in yourself within your own self but if you can get the grace of god that the grace of god can uh can allow the holy ghost to be put inside of you where that same life that was in christ can live in you then you become a law the law is actually written in tables of your heart you become you become the living manifestation of the law then the law will keep then you'll live the law amen now so jonah was our example here's our example of where we're always we're like brother brown said now he said we're always running from responsibility god gives us something to do and and we try we do whatever we can it's just human nature within our own human nature to run away from our responsibility he said every one of us we always are running from something we run from trouble we run from responsibility now maybe tonight just sit there and examine all the things that you've run from let's let's examine ourselves all the things that you in your own personal life that you your responsibilities are things that you've run from that you knew you should have done but you left undone that things that you should have apologized for and the things that you should have done differently and maybe maybe the things that you should maybe you should have started saving up a little money already only in your life you didn't just responsibilities that you you because we run from things our uh it's human nature to just just lay things over to the side and say well i'll catch up with it one day maybe one day one day i'm going to get born again one day i'll give my heart to the lord one day i'll come to church and do what i'm supposed to do one day he and brother i said we're all prone to that he said we are we are more prone to run than we are to stand and face it out we're more prone to run away from the thing than to just stand and face it out and deal with it he said we find ourselves running and now now brother brown he'll cover all these different things that we run from and one of the things that he covers is that one of one thing we run from is we run from work and i think how true that is in this day where it looks like nobody wants to do any work nobody wants to do a good a good honest work you know you even at my work it seems like you know you you try to you you're paying people to do their work but they don't do it and you have to constantly check up on people and constantly hound them and why is that because people are constantly running from work and he said sometimes we find ourselves prone to run from work we don't want to we don't want to work some people just think they can make their living without working now we i know we're getting down to where the rubber meets the road a little bit tonight but you know you it's your responsibility it's your respect you know god god uh he he'll train us up like like child training even god he wants to he wants to see how he how you deal with responsibilities so he gives you a little responsibility and he'll see what you do with it and as you and as you as you're able to deal with more and more responsibility you get a little bit more responsibility so but you see the problem is that a lot of we we will bow up when we when we get confronted with the responsibility you you think about these things tonight as i preach on these things it makes people blow up when you when you start talking to a young person maybe about about how you need to work how you need to get up be a church at a certain time be do do a thing at a certain time or whatever you you blow up that's why you see a lot of times the young people will they'll do the eye rolling and everything oh they do that rolling of the eyes and everything when you when you throw that responsibility in their face they'll roll those eyes around but you see what the adults are trying to see and what god is wanting to see in us is he wants to see how we deal with our responsibility when you tell somebody to go take out the trash and they roll their eyes around oh my god i can't believe anybody wanted me to be responsible then that shows that you're not ready to be you're not ready for some more responsibility what about us in the gospel when god wants to have us to have a little responsibility and we and we roll our eyes and say well i i don't i don't know about it or we we pitch a little fit or have a little tantrum well i don't know if i can believe that i don't know if i'm ready for that then god he he knows that we're not quite ready we're not quite at the place that we need to be so we're talking about work now he said we don't want to work he said some people just think they can make their living without working he said but i think solomon it was that said we could find here the answer and watching an ant now isn't that something that you can go out in your backyard and look down on the ground and find find more about working maybe that you can find anywhere else in the world just about go look at a little ant and recognize hmm that ant knows that if he doesn't get to work he ain't gonna eat in the winter all these animals in the woods know that if the bear if the bear doesn't doesn't uh fatten himself up in the way all year long all summer long come winter time he ain't going to be ready to hibernate there's going to be a problem so but we'll see we shirk we shark away from the responsibility of working he said if every ant doesn't work and lay in that aunt doesn't eat that winter so everybody has to work i was reading an article the other day where this this uh this woman was talking about how she she she believed that their society should get to a place where nobody has to work and i was thinking that's that's just contrary to just that's contrary to everything that's contrary to how you can look out in the in the in nature and just see how things work where you got to work you're you're here as long as we're we're here and not in the millennium not in that future home you gotta work you gotta that's your responsibility you gotta work and brother emma said we got so many things we have to do so much responsibility that we have to face everybody has got to face a certain responsibility so what are we talking about tonight we're talking about facing up with your responsibility facing up with it not shirking it but actually facing up to it a responsibility is the state or fact of being accountable or to blame for something when you're responsible for something you're the one that's to blame if it doesn't go right you're the one that is accountable in other words if if things fall apart in your life so many times we want to we want to make excuses and find somebody else that we can blame we want to blame we want to blame our spouse or we want to blame the pastor we want to blame the deacons or find somebody else but if we really if we really uh face our responsibility it really all comes back to us if our family isn't serving the lord if our children aren't serving the lord then that responsibility comes back to us responsibility is the state of being the person who caused something to happen when you're responsible you are the one that did it you know sometimes i'll get called at work on the weekends and you know somebody might say well why are they calling you because i'm the one i'm the manager of my team at work and if something breaks i'm the one that's responsible even if i didn't break it i got to be the one that answers the phone call and sits on the phone until it's fixed because i'm responsible even if it's in the middle of the night because i'm responsible and that's what being responsible means or being responsible means if you're supposed to be at church at a particular time to do a particular job then you'd be at church at a particular time to do to do the thing because you're the one that if if it all falls apart you're the one that's responsible when something breaks at work i'm responsible there's nobody else that i can blame you're the one that does it now brother said when you get married you've got to take a responsibility like you think about all the responsibility that comes when you get married maybe you build a home it's a pretty nice home and then you're responsible to pay that mortgage then you're responsible in your response to to do all the things that are wrapped up in and living in a home and he said then remember as a married woman you got to think of the responsibility of raising children so now you get married and you're responsible you you know i you know a lot a lot of these dads in here can maybe look back to remember that morning or that maybe that night that you came home and your wife was waiting on you to tell you i took a pregnancy test and and it was you'll never guess what it was and whoa that that weight of responsibility hit you that now things are going to be a little bit different because now you're not just responsible for you and your spouse but now you've got the responsibility you better be provide you you got to pay you got to work out some way to pay for that delivery bill when you when when your wife goes into delivery you got to be responsible for getting her to the doctor and you got to be responsible for all the things that go in with with providing for a home and taking care of that baby you gotta you got to get a crib or you got to get paid for diapers now you got to pay for what however you're going to feed it whether all those things and then you got to be responsible the sisters he said you got to you got to think of them pretty slick walls that's going to have little dirty hand prints all over them your responsibility to keep things clean and tidy so it's your responsibility to keep things clean and tidy and not have a dirty filthy home not have a home where where people are ashamed to come over and fellowship with you i mean he said it i'm not responsible he said it and then you got the responsibility of educating your children you know you begin to think about how how are you going to educate your children now many times you think well i'm going to homeschool my kids well are you equipped to do it are you are you going to do do it are you just going to be kind of lazy are you going to are you going to be one of them homeschool parents that just raises your kids and just said well well you know what let them fend for their self and they grow up and they and they and they graduate high school and they can't hardly read or write now i believe in educating your kids because you know it's a great gift to be able to look into the bible and actually read it for ourselves it's a great gift to be able to know enough abcs and mathematics so you can balance your bank account so i i believe that we have a responsibility that when you when you're schooling your kids you need to be you need to take it seriously enough to be able to raise them up so that one day they can teach their own kids how to do things we your kids grow up knowing barely barely how to read or we educate what about educating them about god it's your responsibility little sisters as the pastor of your home to teach you to gather up your kids around your knees and teach them about god you know honestly sometimes when you come to church we talk things about they're pretty deep but it's your responsibility at home together up around your knees and and talk to them about about these little stories like jonah and tell them about tell them about the little little types and and kind of establish them in the word that's your responsibility but we shark our responsibility so many times like jonah did running away to tarshish he said you got the responsibility of clothing and feeding how will your family be clothed how are you how will your family be clothed what if what if grandma gives your daughters some clothes that they shouldn't be wearing are you going to be like well i'm just going to keep the piece and put the put this dress on her that she don't need to be wearing put these clothes on or are you going to take a stand and face it are you going to take a state what if what what if what if somehow your kids get a hold of some clothes that ain't modest are you just going to let them do it whatever will you let them have their own phone and their own computer and what how you you know things to think about because you're responsible you're responsible for raising your kids and setting a standard in your home and facing the responsibility that's why romans 14 12 says so then every one of us shall give account of himself to god we've all got to give an account now why do we have to give an account because we are responsible now you know you know you think about that so many times we want to blame other people for our predicament whatever but but the bible says you got to give an account of yourself when if if if you were to to to not get things straight here and end up at the white throne judgment you you're you're not going to be standing up there with your pastor next beside you or your your d connects beside you and they're giving an account but you're going to be given the one given an account because everything program said everything is a responsibility and it's so easy when the responsibilities face us to shirk from them we find out that marriage is a responsibility in all matters now going back to marriage now you think about all the things that's wrapped up in a marriage you have a responsibility to love and to be faithful and to provide and marriage may you have a responsibility to love one another so many people in this day and time they enter into into marriage and i i was i was reading this more where i was reading where somebody somebody on the internet was talking about how people just in today's society in modern times they get it in their in their head that if they get married then they can just they go on until they find something better and then they just get divorced and go on with that person but you see when a christian really enters into marriage you're approaching it from the from the standpoint of of love you really love that person and when you love something that's your responsibility with love i'm talking about when you really love somebody you love them through thick and thin and you love them whether or not they're hooked up on a machine at the hospital in a coma you love them you you love that's what love is where you can sit beside somebody and you and they can't even talk back to you with the machine beeping in the hospital but you love them now that's the kind of love that the world don't know nothing about because to them as soon as somebody gets cancer or whatever you read about all these politicians that get their wife gets cancer and the first thing they do is they divorce them and they go off to find somebody else that's not love well they don't know anything about this responsibility that i'm talking about tonight we're talking about shirking responsibilities and brother ram said even many times we find that ministers oh goodness ministers many times shirk a responsibility for standing for the true word of god when they're confronted with it you see what a responsibility we've got we've got a responsibility to preach the word you've got a responsibility to live it you've got a responsibility in your home we've all got areas of our own responsibility he said ministers are assured that responsibility when truth of the word of god is brought face to face faced with with human beings we we are prone to shirk back until the last resource so let's not shirk back from our responsibility you know it's our responsibility as a as a christian when you come into the house of god to give your whole life to god it's your responsibility it's your responsibility as jesus told nicodemus you've got to be born again this is your responsibility to be born again my brother brown told this story about his nephew melvin have y'all ever heard about melvin now now let me before i get into this story mate what you young people how would you feel if we called your name out in service and preached to you like brother branham would preach about people you know he called this brother's name out and talked about he he'd call his his daughter's name out and talk about how overweight she was and things like that have y'all ever heard him say sister rebecca about she's gained a little weight or whatever and and and see see how we we draw up sometimes when the truth is told to us but it's our response god wants you to see sometimes how you'll respond to the responsibility that he wants you to have what are you going to do with it when the truth is presented are you going to bow up and say you can't talk to me like that now brother madam he would say he said i baptized that boy melvin in the name of jesus christ here a few years ago and he got with some little girl and turned catholic and i held his mother's hand while she was dying over there she said to me the last words take care of melvin take care of melvin and now melvin he said melvin has been dreaming dreams now melvin ain't doing right now he he's doing he's he's got on the wrong boat like jonah instead of going to nineveh where the fair has already been paid for him if he'd just get on it he's going to tarshish but he was dreaming dreams he said he's just been dreaming dreams every day the last week he's been dreaming dreams and he said in his dream he said i'd walk into your church uncle bill and you were standing there preaching i'd run up to start to make a confession and i wake up you think about maelva knowing that he's on the wrong boat and he's dreaming that dream about i i i i start i went up to make a confession and i woke up and he said i've been wrong and brother brown told him he said i i said melvin you don't need no interpretation for that your place is down there where you belong that's right see now now maybe tonight we could ask that question do we have any melvins here tonight that are on the wrong boat but you just you just need maybe an invitation to get on the right boat need a reminder that the fare has already been paid to nineveh right you know some sometimes brother ram said sometimes it takes to very hide off of us to face up to our responsibility sometimes you just got to get it laid out in front of you where you can see that you're on the wrong boat and then you can face it takes to hide off of some sometimes don't it it hurts a little bit to be faced with the fact that you're on the wrong boat sometimes it hurts a little bit now people say i know that's right but if i did that that kicked me out of the church thinking about popularity yeah that's what that's what jonah was doing when he he said i i i can't go down to nineveh because i don't know how they'll react to my message thinking about how people are gonna react to what you the life that you live he said what of it if you don't if you don't they're gonna kick you out up there you you got to be kicked out somewhere see it's time to face up to our responsibility and what are we have a responsibility to the truth our responsibility is to the truth what are we going to do when we're presented with the truth you see well what i'm talking about tonight is if you're in melbourne here tonight you might have been in church for five years or 10 years or 20 years paying your tithes and and all the time you've been maybe faking it along the road you you're just here because you're here because your parents are want you to be in church and but but maybe it is time the night to face up to your responsibility and get on the right boat get on the boat to nineveh you don't even have to pay for your fare because jesus paid the fare on calvary he already paid for you [Applause] that's that's what grace is grace is when the fair is already paid all you got to do is walk up to the boatman and say i'm here i'm ready to get on the boat i believe it and just just walk up the plank and say i accept the promise that you've given to me and jesus said search the scriptures for them then you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me but we find that people won't face up to that face up to it face up to the fact that get your loss face up to the fact that you need something else face up to the fact that you've been shirking your responsibilities all this time that you've been coming to church acting like a believer but yet there's something lacking in your life maybe tonight it's time to face up to the fact that you ain't been dressing right and living right and walking right and doing what you know is right but it's time to face up to the fact that you're not on the right boat he said being brought into the presence of god you see what jonah was running he was running from the presence of god it said and when you're brought into the presence of god when you're brought into the circle of believers into the sanctuary and you can see god's word being fulfilled and you can see his promises being made manifest and see that god is obligated to that promise and see that when he brings that promise to pass he said then people are afraid to face up to this responsibility of coping with the message of the hour you know what coat means to cope with the message of the hour to cope means to deal with successfully to deal with it people so they have such a hard time just dealing with life but we got to deal with the message when the message when the truth is preached to you when the truth you got to cope with it one way or another that's why he kept he would say you're going to leave when you go out of the doors you're going to leave better or worse you're going you're going to go out of the door i've seen people go out of the out of church doors and they go out cursing and go out saying all kinds of horrible things because listen you can't help it you're gonna go either church doors better or you're gonna go out worse tonight you're gonna go out leaving believing that i need to face up to my responsibilities and believing that there's a god that can meet my need are you going to go out worse it's time to make up your mind and face up to your responsibility whether you're going to take the truth and do something with it or whether you're going to shirk it like jonah was doing every age has had to face up to the truth of the day every ages had to face up to their responsibility how many lutherans brother brown said was afraid to face up to luther's truth to the truth when they would when they might die if if they would believe luther's truth that you're not justified you're not justified because you pay a priest a bunch of money you're not justified because you pre give your priest that last cow that your family has that you're trying to survive off of that you're not justified that and then they would come and kill people because they believe in martin luther's message and so many people in that day would not face up to the truth now face up to that truth and what about all the methodists brother brown talked about how that they were called the methodists were called holy rollers and if you had to face up to the truth of what that was in that day or else you would face all the ridicule of the people of the of the of the big name believer the big name christians in that day he said they had the jerks and and they were considered a bunch of holy rollers but you had your mothers and fathers had to either accept it face up to the truth and facts or turn it down but what about the pentecostals that received the restoration of the gifts when the baptism and the holy ghost come out with speaking in tongues and the gifts of the spirit come into the church and the methodists wanted to kick them out but you had to face up to it it's something that you had to do why because it's your responsibility as a christian you had to face up to it you had to he said you've got a responsibility everybody has and you must face up to these things you got to face what does that mean to face up to it to see it laying there in front of you and you got to face up to what you're going to do with it are you going to believe it are you just going to be halfway in and halfway out christian a lukewarm christian are you going to be completely sold out to god and let him have prediminance in your life are you going to face up to the fact that there's something wrong in your life he said when you see then in this day now when the word of god has made these promises of things that we see happening now that we've got the responsibility to ever to either face up to it or get away from it you just can't stay neutral you can't stay neutral you got to do something about it some move has got to be made you gotta you gotta move toward it now now you see jonah jonah didn't just sit when god told him to go to nineveh he didn't just sit there he made a move to go to tarshish now that wasn't the right move but he made a move you're going to move one way or the other you got to make your decision now now you see there there's got to be a true answer to every question and tonight we come to a lot of what to church maybe with a lot of questions that we're confronted with and maybe it's time to face up to what those questions are brother said when something is confronted if there's a question about it there's got to be an answer so we got to face up to those things it's our responsibility to face up to it maybe our questions tonight are is the message true is the baptism of the holy ghost really for me is it can i be born again is there grace for me in this hour and he said as long as there's a question there's got to be a direct answer somewhere now now direct answer don't mean just somebody's opinion but it means there's something that's right there's something that's true when i if i was going to ask somebody if you were out in the woods hunting or or something that you you say well where's the west there there's west is a coordinate on the map it's a it's a point on the compass if somebody was to tell you well nor west is northwest then after a while you'd get all turned around you realize you weren't going in the right direction and you go hunting for somebody that could tell you where west is in other words there's got to be a truth which way is west there's got to be a truth and there's got to be a truth to every there's got to be a truth to every question when we ask if there's a question in your mind there's got to be a truth now now see that the responsibility that we're talking about tonight is there's a responsibility to find out where the truth is and the truth i believe is in this message like now all these questions that that we've had in the past what is the name of god or how should i be baptized or is god made up three different personalities or is he one personality what does it mean to be born again is there grace for me is there grace for me in this hour to be saved what was the holy ghost given for now you got the holy ghost what's it for that's a question in your mind and the question is in this message that's where that's why we rely so much on what the bible says what the bible teaches because the bible has the answer to every question it's got the answer to the question of life it's got the answer to every question of what your responsibility is in this life now that i'm born again now what's the kingdom of heaven what's the mystery of iniquity what's all these things what what was it eating an apple when you read the book of genesis now listen now think about the grace of god that's been given to us to have an answer to all these questions why did john write about seven churches what are the seven golden candlesticks that john saw who is that seventh angel in revelation 10 that it talks about there's there's got to be an answer to all those questions and the answer cannot be found in any denominational system there's only one place that you can find the answer to all these questions and brother adam said when these questions confront us about the bible truths there's got to be the right answer somewhere that's right it's got to be there there's a common say in that well we just have to i've heard i've heard people say this well we we just have to worship how we feel led we just have to do how we feel led i've heard that so many times lately we just have to do when you when you confront somebody when you put put the truth in front of them well i just have to do how i'm laying no you need to do you need to look into the bible of how you should be doing because what if what if you're being led wrong what if what if you're being led by your own opinions or by what somebody told you but there's a truth there's a true answer to every question there's a right and a wrong there's a truth to whether or not you should be coming to church there's a truth to whether or not you should be whether or not you should be sitting at home just streaming and all those kind of things a truth and god wants us to worship him in truth the truth there's a truth which is why in john chapter 4 when he was talking to that little woman at the well he said the hour cometh and now he is when the true worshiper shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seek us to such to worship him so he said why don't brother i said why don't you take the bible and sit down and face up to it study it study it over just look it over and check it out yourself with the word amen see so many times we end up sympathizing with things and thinking well i think that over there sounds real good or whatever but god wants us to god wants us to get into the truth and get into the into the into the truth of the thing he said when we find these things though we're confronted and come into a meeting and see the power of god moving and doing things and doing supernatural works and see it performed and look in the bible and see that it's promised for this hour then we are confronted with a responsibility to either accept it i mean he said i mean as for ourselves to accept it not not just not just for your neighbor not just for the person sitting on the pew next to you but accept it for yourselves accept it accept it now except that it means to to embrace it as the truth and give yourself to it to become one with it to accept it not not just to look over at it and say well that seems like a pretty good idea and you know that's how many so so many people and and churches today do they'll come into church and they'll sympathize with it and they think it looks real good and i think it's real nice to be able to sit in a church where things are happening and things god the spirit of god is moving he said many people sympathize many people say it's right but that sympathizing sympathize and ain't the thing that you're responsible for you're responsible for accepting the truth you know he gave the example of you know a young man looking at a girl and and he he'd examine her and say well that's a real christian girl and she exhibits all the qualities of a real christian lady that i admire and i'd like to make her my wife and he just sits there and sympathizes with her that that that ain't how that ain't how you'd even do with a natural to just sit there and sympathize with her he said no matter how much i say she's perfect she's exactly right she is a mind until i accept her and the responsibility of her being my wife when you accept her and you put that ring on her finger then you're taking the responsibility on of providing for you're taking on all the things that go into being married to her and that's what accepting is when you accept christ you're taking on all the things that go in with being a christian you're taking on the reproach of being a christian you're taking on on the blessings of being a christian you're taking on the joy of being a christian everything that goes into being a christian you're taking on because you've accepted it you're not just looking at it with sympathy saying well it looks like a good idea he said that's the same thing the message is you might say it's right or this that or the other and say i sympathize with it i believe it's the truth but you've got to accept it and it's got to become a part of you and you are part of it then it's yours you know what sympathize means would just sympathize means to agree with a sentiment or opinion to agree with it that's a good that's a good thought that the preacher was preaching on you see the danger the danger is there you can sympathize with the wrong thing too you you see a lot of times the minister will say well you got to be careful with that person that came into the church the way that they frame that or the words that they use that's not quite accurate and everybody will people will rise up and say well you're being too critical or whatever and the reason is because they're sympathizing with that they begin to sympathize with the wrong thing that's that's why you know brother in one place he said that shepherds are suspicious because shepherds are like shepherds are watching over the sheep to see if wolf is going to come in they're watching over things to see if something's going to encroach so you know sometimes it might pay it might do you good to pay attention when a shepherd says watch out for that over there because it's dangerous to sympathize with the wrong thing it's dangerous to get caught up with the wrong thing and say well i think you're being a little bit too critical or whatever sometimes being a little bit too critical is is is a good thing sometimes it's good because why we're we're after the truth we're responsible for the truth we're not responsible for sympathizing we're responsible for the truth jonah was running from nineveh because he wanted to take the easy route to tarshish and we don't want ships that'll take the easy route jonah didn't want to face up he hated to do that he he thought them gentiles it's hard to tell what they'll do to me but he had to face up to it and we've got to face up to our responsibility to face up to the truth it's easy to take the easy way where everybody can pat you on the back and say you're a good fella and this is so so a certain in the world will look upon you it's easy to go the popular way that goes for ministers that goes for young people everybody it's easy to take that popular way where your your friends can pull you around back behind behind the church or and start telling you all their their their wicked ideas and their wicked plans and their wicked devices it's because you're interested in popularity it's easy to take that that that easy road in matthew chapter six it said take heed that you do not your arms before men want in popularity popularity don't even do your good deeds to parade them out in front of everybody because popularity is a is a minefield he said therefore when they'll do us down do us down almost do not sound a trumpet before the as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have glory of man don't do all your good deeds in front of everybody because why because that's the easy way it's easy to get on facebook and post all the good things you know there's a trend lately on facebook or on social media where people when they have a lot of money they'll go out and give a homeless person on the street like a thousand dollars or give them a night in a hotel and and it looks like a good deed but the reason they're doing that is because they got maybe a million people following their channel and they're trying to get money off of that so they're they're parading their good deeds with something good here i'm going to give and the homeless person is weak but thank you for the thousand dollars it's a good thing but they're parading that good deed around it that's exactly what the bible says not to do you parade your good deed out in front of everybody it's what are you what are you really wanting you wanting a pat on the back you're wanting to pat on the back john chapter 12 said nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him but because of the pharisees they did not confess him lest they should be put out of the synagogue for they love the praise of men they love the praise of men more than the praise of god you see what a trap that is when you start looking for the praise of men more than the praise of god and it makes you it'll make you make you preach different it'll make you do act different around other people a preacher that wants to praise a man can't preach the gospel right because the preaching the preaching of the gospel is not designed for you to get pat's on the back it's it's designed to change lives it's not designed for you know brother and would say things he don't about how god won't want mixers you know what a mixer is somebody going around kissing babies and going to park social events and things so that they can get pass on the back but that's not what the ministry you know the gospel is the preaching of the gospel is scalding and hurtful and and straightens you up why because it makes you face up to your responsibility it makes you face up to the things that are lacking in your life we don't want the praise of our prayers or the praise of our friend group or the praise maybe even of your family you know that's where that praise of your family will get you in trouble when you're supposed to be in church but your family's got they schedule that event on sunday and you get all hung up on that because you well i want the praise of my family more than the praise of god and you'd rather go to that event that your church your family has scheduled on sunday because you're not you're putting that above god you'd rather do what your family's doing than what god wants you to do your place is at church on sunday morning your place is at church in romans chapter 3 it says that he's a jew which is one annually and circumcision is that of the heart and the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not a man amen but god what what kind of a church would we be if we were all seeking the praise of god and not of men we'd get alone in our prayer closet and ask for god's blessing on our life and confirmation that we're walking in the way that he wants us to be to be doing instead of looking to one another for our for our confirmation but he said when you have to do something different when you have to stand to your conviction of what you know to be the truth there is where the hard part is there's where the rub is now he said you take a woman she might not ever be very attractive or whatever she is but you let that woman stand for principles of womanhood let her stand like a lady and if a man's got an ounce of man about him he'll take up for i think that's something that should resonate with all of the sisters in here even even you know we we've got some beautiful sisters in here but even if you're not beautiful what really makes you beautiful is your character the character of somebody that will stand for something true you see you you see a uh you see a a a young lady that's supposed to be a christian but yet she's going out here and and and pants and doing things that she's not supposed to be a real christian man is not going to be looking for that but you see maybe maybe a sister that that she looks she looks like she's going to be a real mother she's going to raise her face she's going to take that responsibility seriously and she's wearing the clothes of she's clothed in righteousness a real christian man is going to be like that's somebody that stands for something that i admire you see ephesians chapter 6 said wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and have it done all to stand we're our responsibility is to stand for something and he said stand there for having your loins girl about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness god wants to see somebody that stands for him and if you stand for god if you want god for stand for you stand for his word if you're standing for his word when trouble strikes then you can have confidence that he'll stand for you where can i find that in the bible brother bob and the bible says in matthew chapter 10 and whosoever therefore shall confess me before me and him will i confess also before my father which is in heaven what's that mean when you confess that lord i believe i'm healed i believe i'm saved i believe when you go to work and you tell somebody the reason why you're acting the way that you do the reason i've told people before at work the reason why i won't drink alcohol when they have their social events you confess you'd make it you make a stand for for something and then god will confess you in heaven he said but whosoever shall deny me before me and him will i also deny before my father which is in heaven think not that i am come to send peace on earth i came not to send peace but a sword amen see that's what that's what a lot of times we we think the christian journey is about that we should all be at peace with with one another when somebody comes in and preaches something that's contrary to the word well we want to be peaceful now we want we don't want to say nothing we just all want to be we just all i believe in being loving and kind and everything listen i believe i believe if you disagree with brother you can throw your arms around them and call them your brother but but that don't mean that i gotta agree with what they say there's a lot of things i don't agree with but yet i call the brothers my brother and i i love them there's there's differences you know some people some people believe we didn't land on the moon some people believe we did land on the moon some people republican some people are democrat but yet we can all put our arms around one another they call us love but yet there's there is a truth there is a truth there is a real west and if you're going northwest or southwest it might be good to find out whether you're really going west or not brother adam said he that will stand for me here i'll stand for him there he that witnesses of me here i witness for him in the presence of god and the holy angels he said decent thinking people will think more of you if you'll stand for your conviction decent thinking people will think more of you now now worldly people won't think more of you because worldly people the devil wants you to not stand for nothing that's why you're a lot of your worldly friends they don't they don't want you to stand for nothing they want you to they want you to keep smoking that marijuana with them and hanging around with them and and talking dirty and using cuss words and looking at women as they walk by they won't they want to hear you say all that stuff but when you start taking a stand for the truth then they won't want to be your friends anymore because they're not concerned about taking a stand but somebody this decent thinking will be concerned about taking a stand he said when everybody likes you nobody disagree with you do you disagree with nobody if that that ain't a dishrag you think about that now disagree with nobody he's saying that's a dishrag because there's gonna be disagreements it's okay to disagree you know what disagreeing it actually we sharpen one another when there's a disagreement and you can talk about it now if you've got the right spirit about it if you got the right spirit you but you're going to disagree there there no there's nothing wrong with this degree so many times some disagreements crop up and somebody will say well well you we should almost like we shouldn't disagree we sh the word is what will will hone our thinking the word is transforming our mind but when somebody across the country or whatever disagrees with me somebody preaches something different i can't help but disagree you're going to have a disagreement if there's a truth and listen there's going to be even more disagreements as it's honed down to that razor sharp point at the top of this pyramid there's going to be disagreements where things begin to fall off and you begin to say the way that i used to think about that is different than the way that i think about it now i i can look at just all the minister friends that i used to know that that that they changed the way that they're thinking they they preach different now people that people they used to side with different things and and the word got a hold of them and it transformed their thinking and they're they're doing things different now and as they do things different you you you're going to have disagreements he said we have many easy ways to go ships going down to tarshish for it's easy the unresponsibilities it's easy hey you know it's like he used that example of going down a river and and the currents taking you one way and what we want to do is we want to you you're rolling up the river you know and what we want to do is we just want to let the oars go and just let the river the current carry us wherever carry us over into the bank of of drinking alcohol carry us over to the bank of just sitting at home and or whatever whatever your your your thing area of shirking responsibility is carry us over to the bank of laxness and carry us over into the bank of not not not doing what you're supposed to be doing but because it's hard taking responsibility is hard to to row against that current and pull that over and and and strive and struggle against the current of the river he said you get your oars and start pulling up against the current you don't make much time and it goes hard but you just want to let loose the oars and watch how fast you pass the trees going down but look where you're going there's a waterfall he said when things are floating easier remember you're going towards a great cataract down there of some sort you're going towards the false and it won't be long you'll be going over that false you see that's why that's what preachers are preaching so hard against it gets going over the falls we're warning the gospel is a warning to you that if you're not taking responsibility if you're not facing the facts you're heading for destruction you've got to accept responsibility you must accept your responsibility and the responsibility that god has given us in this day is to bring this message to accept this message to do something with it he said we must get down to it and everywhere we go and tell the message and tell the people that jesus christ is coming that he's god and he's coming soon amen why cause you if you got the answer if you know which way is a west you've got to tell it you're under an obligation to tell it that's right i i was listening i don't know if you know that philosopher he's i guess that's the right way to call him jordan peterson he's kind of famous these days but he that's what he was talking about he that if you know the truth you're under under obligation to proclaim it you have a responsibility to tell the truth if you know the truth but man is always shirking their responsibility just like adam shirked his responsibility when adam didn't face up there in the garden he had he had a responsibility to either like like what boat you're gonna get on he had the responsibility to either stay with eve or get on the boat with god that's the responsibility that the test that i abraham was presented when he when god told him you you either take isaac or you take me you either sacrifice isaac or you take me which boat are you going to get on and abraham made the right choice i'm going to i'm going to lay down everything everybody's got something they got to lay down in your life are you going to take are you going to just go on through your life with that thing that you're unwilling to lay down are you going to face up to it face up to the fact that you've got a responsibility to the truth to accept it and believe it he said think of it god only give them adam and eve eight or ten words to keep but of that tree thou shalt not eat that's all they had to keep and even with that much word they broke it every man had to face up every man has a responsibility for before god you've got a responsibility you've got a responsibility to go to nineveh and you've got a responsibility to make a move you've got to make a move you've got to act you got to you got to step up and and believe you got to do something he's because brother ryan said faith without works is dead the bible says faith without works is dead in other words if you're just sympathizing with it you won't make a move but if there's something if you're ready to accept it you'll make a move toward that thing he said if you say i believe it and don't make no act just like the message if you say i believe it don't make an act what good does it do you know what what good would it have done if noah just sympathized with it when when when god told him you need to go build an ark but he didn't just sympathize with it he went and got his toolbox he went and rounded up all his tools and well i i don't know if how they would cut wood and everything back then all the things that they would use but he went and he grabbed his hammer and he got to work and that's what you do when you really accept the truth is you go to work you got to do something when something strikes you and you realize you're not in the right place you go to grab those oars and you got to roll and something's got to happen you begin to get desperate in your hour of desperation like jonah was down in that belly of well something's got to give you begin to like jonah did i know that if i look with faith toward god something's going to happen why because faith prompts you to act you've got to do something god told it god told jonah arise go to nineveh that great city and cry against it for their wickedness has come before me and god wants us to cry he wants to cry against the evil of the world he wants to cry cry out to your children and to your family don't do those things don't do those wicked things of the world he wants the ministers to cry out with the truth because we've got a responsibility for the truth amen brother said cry out against it there it is that's the subject cry out against it there's the check part just go there and tell those fellas say i come down to join up with you guys you know i believe i'll tell you what i'll do i've got just a little thing here i believe i can bring us all together and do this down to the other no but it was cry out against it when you have to cry out against something he said now he had to cry out against everything that was down there no you think about jones commission to cry out against the city they cried against their work cry out against their church they cried against their prophets they cried against their ministers they crowd against their priests cry against the whole thing cry out against you see why this gospel is not something where we just pat one another on the back and we go along trying to make everybody at peace but there's it's gonna cause division it's going to cause disagreement because we when you stand for something you're standing for the truth not everybody's going to see the truth noah cried out against his age and moses cried out against it at every junction you've got somebody you've got people that are continually crying out you got ministers continually crying out elijah was unpopular in his day because he cried out against that age john the baptist was unpopular and he got his hand chopped off because he was crying out for it he was crying out against it he was crying out against the way that herod was the marriage and divorce situation with the herod got himself all wrapped up in and he began to cry out against it but you see they faced right up to it they faced up to the challenge of the day they faced up to their responsibility they never run they stood and they faced the facts they faced the facts are we willing to face the facts of whether our life was worthy of the gospel or not or whether we're living this message of whether we're believing whether we're on the right track or not and they you gotta you gotta do something in amos chapter three verse eight it says the lion after lord who will not fear the lord god has spoken who can prophesy you know what that means if a lion roars in the jungle brotherhood said you it's an automatic reaction to go whoa if you hear a lion roar it automatically causes a reaction and when the lord speaks something who can help but prophesy it's an immediate and instant reaction that cannot be helped there's got to be somebody something to cry to call out and he said when i see god doing anything and i see it here in the word and he promised it who can hold their peace and keep still who can keep still when the truth is vindicated to you and when the word is preached in the power of demonstration who can when you see the promises of god being made real when you see people in the church being filled with the holy ghost when you see people in the church dreaming dreams that come to pass and signs and wonders being fulfilled and living out of testimony how can you help but stay but do something how can you help but have a reaction but man tries to find a substitute like adam and eve in the garden trying to find a substitute for substituting the fig leaves for the real promise of god god wants somebody to be real sincere he wants somebody to be real sincere and face up to the truth face up to the facts i'm gonna try to wind down here now now you think do you think now when johnny got on the wrong boat everything brother ram said god was in everything that happened after that a storm came up now you think now those of you that are on the wrong boat tonight maybe there's a lot of stuff going wrong in your life maybe there's a lot of things going wrong in your life maybe there's been a lot of wrong decisions that you made that you didn't face up to and maybe that was all god moving you along to the place that you're in now to finally face up to your predicament he said he said if you're a true christian truly called like jonah was god was in all god was in all of those things he was in that storm that came up he was in the the people calling doing the uh trying to find out where where the problem was he was in that well he created a whale that come up from the deep and swallowed alone at jonah he was in he was in all of those things all of those things were moving john into a place where he would he would be in the right spot to fully trust god and really to get it into a place where he could when he got dumped out in nineveh he could cry out in the right way because god wanted that message to be declared god knew that somebody had to be responsible for crying out that message and the only one that could do it was jonah moses couldn't couldn't have preached that message to nineveh jeremiah couldn't have preached that message to nineveh isaiah couldn't have preached that message to nineveh and nobody else god doesn't want anybody else but you right now he wants you you're the one that he's crying out for and all of the all those things are circumstances in your life god is the one that's been moving god has been the one molding you to bring you to a place you want to what is it it's predestination the whole time god looking for that predestinated seed mold searching and looking for somebody that will respond to the truth for the responsibility of the hour come into the fullness of him brother i'm saying he said we don't want the popular idea we want the truth and we don't want to face up to nothing but what god has said is the truth but be sure that your sins will always find you out if you're on the if you're in that boat sailing away to the cataract selling away to the to the falls your sins will find you out eventually he said if it doesn't here it'll get you at the judgment it's going to catch you somewhere he said come into the fullness of him your way is paid to where it's paid to nineveh your weight is your way is already paid that's why i'm preaching tonight your way is paid he paid for it on calvary he died on the cross so that all you'd have to do is accept him it's paid the need of a not to tarshish and he said you're predestinated there's a ship leaving right now on this road so there's only one thing to do is get on it and you'll never have peace till you get on the right boat you'll never have peace till you get on the right ship listen you'll come to church and you'll sit in the congregation of the lord and you'll look at other people receiving the blessing of god and receiving their deliverance but you won't have peace you'll sit there watching and other people being the label to live and overcoming life and being able to dress right and walk right and talk right and being able to be delivered from their depression and being able to deliver it from their old faults and things but you won't have peace because you're on the wrong boat and jonah never had peace while he was in the wrong boat he never had peace till he got dumped over the water down in that belly of the whale and dumped out in nineveh so he could fulfill god's purpose in his life so he could fulfill what god wanted him to do and there's a purpose that god wants you to fulfill if you're not fulfilling that now you're not at peace i i wonder tonight as the missus musicians come if you could just examine yourself examine whether or not you're at peace tonight down in your soul is there something that's crying out recognizing that there's something off kilter you know you know whether there's something wrong or right you know whether there's something right in your heart and if there's not now is the time to give up and surrender to god brother brown said there's no way of getting out of it when god ever takes out after you just might as well give up and go home that's all let's stand to our feet you might as well give up you might as well surrender you might as well just kill up because you'll never have peace until you do that let's go ahead and sing something you love the lord 369.
