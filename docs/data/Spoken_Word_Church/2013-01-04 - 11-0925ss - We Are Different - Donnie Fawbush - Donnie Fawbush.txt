========================================

time that we gather together and I'll speak about him I wanted to be him and the only way I know they're doing is we've got to call him on the scene so and there's a lot of people traveling so I need to pray for ready Yes precious Heavenly Father we thank you once again for the the place you've brought us to give this little from the church here in a little and brought all the brothers and sisters and what I call my family the father God that you've shown me I see the beautiful faces here on these days that we get to meet with this the joy of my weak Lord and I asked your father to this morning just to forgive us of our sins and as we go today to talk about you and take in your word Lord I asked it don't let us say anything or do anything and ever harm or get in the way father of your will and I asked Lord all of those today that are out traveling brother Bob brother Aaron Brother Wade any of the Little briders hear this out to him and ask you Lord just touch them and bless them and be with them and bring them home safely bless their fellowship with others father God and I ask you especially touch brother Wade and bless him Lord and let him speak those things you placed on his heart to uh come across those lips you've made a clay to those people that you sent it to the brothers and sisters out there that will be blessed Lord and that's just bring him home safe and that's all the other ones if I missed any names Lord you know who they are and we ask that you bless the bride around the world bless the bride here home and father God bless her reading and speaking of your word just won't even ask you just to come over sing and bless us father God Be Your Presence your holy spirit that we might know that you are our God and we are your people we ask these things in your precious Name Lord Jesus Christ hope I didn't leave anything out um first of all that white lights that's okay go ahead anything will do to help I want to turn one of all my children being huh yeah they've been Fellowship okay let everybody cheer uh I want to turn to First Congress if we might I want to speak a minute about uh one person called King David I think his uh First Chronicles 28 uh 18. is that by there am I ready oh yeah I thought that looked real strange First Chronicles 28 First Chronicles 28. aha now this looks a little bit better and this is gonna I'm gonna try to work this into what I want to speak about this morning we're gonna start out first Chronicles 28. and for the altar of incense gotta know that in this part this is David talking to people and Solomon and Lord he's he's set up 28 18. First Chronicles 28 18. is that by there about ready yeah okay anyway David has set up with uh and it's about David's time to move on over and pass this thing on to Solomon and to fulfill what God has told him and brought him here to do and he's telling all the things that he's going to do and build in the temple and all the the gold the silver everything is coming he's telling it and right here I'm reading this and for the offer of incent for fine gold by weight goal for the pattern of The Chariot of the cherubims that spread out their wings and covered the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord all this David said Lord made me understand in writing by his hand upon me even all the works of this pattern y'all understand what David is saying there he's saying the Lord has done this to him he wrote it brought it out said this is what I want you to do my point here you're gonna I'm gonna come on down I'm gonna read 20. and David said to Solomon's son be strong and of good courage and do it fear not nor be dismayed well the Lord God even my God will be with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee until thou has finished all the work for the service of the house of the Lord and of course he goes on and tell that the priest and all the Levites and everybody else will be there with him to help him and all of that and of course really when I read this 28 29 my heart is set a fire because of here's a man that had everything in the world they had it all and he it was time for him to do what he was supposed to do and he he put it right back to where it come from he knew that God would always be there with him and and David my my title is going to be we must be different as an end time people and I hope that I get the points across that I want to bring because to do this scripture of Justice you'll have to see that he said he'd never leave us he'd never forsake us he's there he's our all in all this is something I've been speaking about and I'm talking to myself I'm looking at a mirror when I'm telling y'all this because I want you to understand I have shortcomings as a human being a bunch a whole truckload have people that work with me know me every day and see these things and Lord help me forgive me for some of the things but these are things that we do fall into and you have to stop and go oh yeah turn around go back and we gotta do this thing right because being a child of God if I'm gonna act like my father I better be like this word because this word is who he is and that's the way it is with all of us here now I wanna I wanna read some things and this may I don't know how it's going to all work out but nevertheless Lord work it out uh I want to start off by reading them a little thing and and just to show you that we got to be different than what we're looking at here but how close is the difference how close is it Brother Gary Atkins and I was out there talking this morning about something he gave me a great idea about taking the scriptures and going back and showing through all the young people how scripturally what brother Brown brought was great and I was going I was going to get him to really come on out but we ran out of time but Lord willing one day we'll do that and that's what I'm trying to shove this morning a little bit anyway I'm gonna read from the prophets Palmer worm locusts canker worm and caterpillar and I'm gonna read a little simple thing that we all know about everyone else here knows about this because we've been taught this he and this is on the page 33 uh paragraph 223 through 224 and he said right here he said the we don't know whether there be any Holy Ghost and he's talking about uh Paul being out there speaking to those people right off the bat about how they were baptizing and of course brother Branham being the prophet it is brings instant understanding to this thing in about two paragraphs that we can all follow he said then how was you baptized it says in King James undo what read it in the original it says how unto what means the same thing unto and how means the same thing how was you baptized they said we've been baptized by John and the same man baptized Jesus now they're saying this is John he baptized Jesus you're going to go tell him he's wrong there's Prophet is going to say that he's going to tell it like it really is because that's a good baptizing by John and the same of the same man watered the same one that baptized John when Paul said that won't work anymore yeah he kind of stood him up when he said that and I know we've all experienced this when we've been talking to people about baptism simple things water baptism but it's not simple it's really not because those people are hung on this and you know if you deal with it this is how close it is to them that won't work anymore that's what Paul said that ain't no good no more he's done come been crucified because John baptized unto repentance not remission of sins saying you should believe on him who come Jesus Christ and when they heard this they walked out into the water and was baptized again in the name of Jesus Christ Paul laid his hands on them and the Holy Ghost come on them they prophesied and spoke in tongues is that right Paul consecrated me and also or two uh had been baptized by the same man that baptized Jesus told them they had to be baptized over because they wasn't baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ all right I say the same thing it's the same Doctrine now what did Paul say in Galatians 1 8. now he done uh that how many knows that the the truth says amen congregation says amen Ed and he said if an angel from heaven let alone a preacher out of a church or a denominational if any angel from heaven comes and preaches any other gospel then this let him be a curse I'm going to stop right there because we know the rest of the story and what happened there now he gets on them even a pastor missionary anybody um but I want I want to show you that that is like I said a simple thing to us but I want to now go back and read the word different and what it means I took four four uh meanings of it from the English dictionary number one it says an adjective partly or completely unalike not identical or the same out of ordinary unusual and I love this one not alike in character or quality um right now I want to turn over to Matthew 24 24. y'all can turn it if you like y'all know what I'm going to read because I want to show you that there are two forces here working at all times and when I'm getting to one point foreign get there uh all right Matthew 24 24. everybody there well that shall arise false cries false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect I wrote this in last night after I was sitting there having a duel with my computer that was really beating me up a little bit uh and just the daily things of life that people run into with little energy levels floating around uh experience attached to sometime but I was sitting there reading that and I was trying to pull up some other things on this on the prophet's message and I wanted to say that uh here we are that I'm looking at this stuff and what pops up on my screen right off the bat it was like it was the only thing on the computer William Marion Brown false prophet of the age now when you're sitting there trying to pull up something to talk to this group here listen we've heard the word here we know the word I mean we've got to produce you and when they're sitting here and I'm sitting there looking at this and this pops up on the screen I have to stop reading something drew me right to it said read it well when I got through naturally the devil's trying to get me off course here I said well I'll put this on the back burner I know what he said because that's about everything this um I won't say anything about him except he's an unearned person that would say these things about the prophet really don't know anything about him and all he was trying to do was pump up his own flag look at me I'm proving this guy wrong well I got news for you it ain't gonna happen because every argument the man had he shot himself in the foot on every one of them by Miss quote me by his own quotes I doubt he ever read anything from what I read but to make a point it took me to another place and when I seen that that's why I want this Matthew 24 24 because we are different we've got to be different and this is some of the things that we're going to be faced with we're faced with them every day because you get people come in there and they'll come up to you and they'll start talking to you when you see them out there in Walmart and things like that I I used to kind of like oh boy you know something inside of me said no no no you can't do that go talk to them brother random had that problem one time with a prostitute I think come in a restaurant where he was at Lord took him behind the barn talked to him a little bit didn't he well that's the way this this thing if it's going to work it's got to be that level it's got to be that level of love and understanding for the for God's creation because we don't know how this thing's going I mean we know how our part's coming because the words telling us but we don't know who else is to come in I mean you entertain angels unaware we do every day okay I'm getting off my subject here uh let's see I wanted to read some things right here to show God how he's how he's coming in in form and thing and how he has done a little bit uh I'm gonna read to you just a few minutes and then I want to get down to a one last thing that that I'm going to bring that I hope that this made sense to all of you uh and Shalom is the message Sierra Vista Arizona on a Sunday 640112 uh I've read there's 252 and remember when the full Bible listen and closing when this full Bible has been thoroughly Vindicated and there will be an eternal Shalom Eternal peace see he come and said he was peace on Earth Good Will towards men but the world didn't receive it see see he was peace to everyone that come to him for peace see so I'll understand that I said whoever comes to you get what you ask for from him because he's our father he wants us to be happy right he didn't put us here to be miserable or not get along one another because she had a loved one he was pleased to everyone that come to him for PC peace on Earth Good Will to men he was at peace at that new year beginning new day of God for why he was a a Vindicated light on that day see but there's more word to be Vindicated or a Vindicated he's got to vindicate more words and when the last word is dove Vindicated is Vindicated rather than death is swallowed up in Victory and the dead in Christ shall rise the Millennium will set in and it will be great peace Shalom let's lay up for that day brother and sister well that one great Shalom remember the Bible is the foundation of all wisdom and holds all holes of the future to the church Shalom let us pray now unveiling of God in Jeffersonville 640614 IN morning service paragraph 77 now when it was said that week so oh I'm trying to figure it out my computer kind of printer kind of messed me up there a weird thing like this the English word I'm going to skip that one okay because I can't read it clearly and so I don't want a spark plug there but I will read the other section of it that is he changed himself he he was talking about right here that uh the English word are the emptied poured out of him or see something went out of him that was different from him he was different he wanted this to come out he wanted it to be displayed but the word kinos in the Greek does not mean that he bought it up or something his arm went off or his eye went out to another person that is he changed himself he poured himself into another mask into another form not another person went out of him called the Holy Spirit but it was he himself you get it he himself poured himself into the people Christ in you how beautiful how wonderful to think God poured himself into human beings into the believer poured out it was a part of his drama to do so God all the fullness all that God had bodily was in this person Jesus Christ he was God and God Alone not a third person or a second person or first person but the person God bailed in human flesh unveiling God I'm going on down to 79 now first Timothy 3 16 without controversy great is the mystery of godliness for God Elohim Capital God in the Bible referred it back anybody it refers to in the original it said Elohim in the beginning Elohim C and Elohim without controversy great is the mystery of Elohim for Elohim was made flesh and we handled him Elohim bailed in human flesh the great Jehovah that covered all of his face time and everywhere was made man we handled him Elohim in the beginning Elohim and Elohim was the flesh dwelt Among Us uh going on down what this is the way the parts of drama that's the way he's to act it out God's provided way Prophet preached a message on that his wife of rebuilding himself to us as some different person okay we are mortal and he knows that we only understand as morals we only know as morals we only know as our senses will let us know and the rest of it we have to believe by man we have to say there is a God whether we see him or not we believe it any anyhow whether there is or not we still believe it because God said so remember that God said something I didn't say so God said so that's what you want to remember now this is a identified Christ of all ages Topeka Kansas 640617 you see all these things just portrayed Christ he was part of it God doesn't change his nature doesn't change he his character doesn't change he's still the word see Malachi 3 6 proves that he just changes his form from each age each age he has allotted part of the word which has been prophesied what happened in certain days well at this age comes along God just moves into another form see it's got all the time the word the word may flesh and dwelt Among Us now I want to go to Hebrews 4 and 12. right quick uh I love this I really do everybody all right okay Hebrews 4 to 12. uh and right here it says he's identified Christ of all ages now Hebrews 4 we find out 4-12 I'm gonna stop right there I'm gonna read four and 12. for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit and of the joints in Maryland is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart I'm not going to stop there I want to continue reading neither is any creature that is is not manifested in his sight but all things are naked and opened unto his eyes of him what do we have to do seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession hold on that word for we have not and high priest which cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmity but was in all points temping like as we are yet without sin Amen Let Us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in time of need um I just to bring out a few examples of that and I think what a wonderful thing to be able just to go to the throne of God and say father forgive me I know I've seen and we have to do that I do I don't know about y'all but I have to every day every morning before I started my day I said Lord let me put the armor on because I know what we're going to go dealing with uh in our business we deal with people who are unfortunate they really are but you should see some of the struggles those people go through if you don't think you'll blessed people and you're different come to our house watch these people walk in there with their children listen they're scratching just to stay alive I thank God for every one of them and that he'd lift them up and I thank God he sent them to us because if nothing else I can walk in and see what we represent the word and a lot I'm gonna talk to us about it and and I hope and I know that once this seed is put out to them that it comes back and I hope it does with each and every one of them because listen we got to stop and think about the things that are in our lives that that we have that we don't appreciate I'm guilty I am guilty about that I just gonna go over this I got a few minutes y'all to get tickled at me here because I wrote down a bunch of things the other morning by 4 30. this just come to my head and really who was the first on my list of being different talking about difference uh when I first come to this over here y'all know I was different but I was called something brought me here and it was the love I felt for my mother and my daddy I could see all the hard work my daddy done his whole life he was like a mule he pulled a cloud he busted rocks but he got her done none of his sons wound up going to prison or got into any major trouble by the grace of God and we all were workers every one of us none of us sat down and were lazy people because he taught us all those things I got the best out of him and I will say that for the last three years it was a pleasure to have him as my father to sit there and talk to this man about the seals him 84 years old and he'd wake up and he'd say tell me what you know well it didn't take me long but I would tell him the best I could and he'd say well that's fine now let me tell you what I think he went through the seals Lord help he went through them in just a few minutes for the frame corn and I said Lord and then he dropped right back off and went back to sleep and I'm sitting there so tired I can't hardly stand up myself but when he spoke of that I said wow here he is barely on his last breath and he's still pumping this out what a volume it's brother Mark said and uh it's a wonderful thing we have here I want everybody to see that regardless if the day comes to an end if they walk in here and say you're done we're taking you crazy people out of here I hope this is an empty building and everybody piles in if I was in line I hope I'm the first one but I want to talk about this just for a second here kind of bring a little light to it because we're fixing to go up and get fed some real steak but I wanted to say that the indifference the first person I've seen I run into here wanting to make a difference in my life and he has with brother Wayne now if there's two people in the world outside that would have had a respect for one another way but probably two different because I'm one side and he's the other he's full of energy bouncing around all the time just going going going going and that's not a bad thing that's a great thing because I'm a slow person sitting down not doing anything so I need a person like that kind of stirred me along you know buzz me up and get me going but what a difference but once I sing the heart and I know he must have seen something in me other than I'm gonna I'm Gonna Fill his heart with what I know in his mind I'm gonna get I'm gonna put something in that mind that can go down besides junket he's heard all his life and he has done that the Lord is blessed by the way and guess what I've been blessed by it okay we've all been so blessed by this word that's come here from Brother Dale and the ministry in this church it's real it's proof it's all I can say about it and I wanted to go on down it's just like think about King David standing out there he had to go up against Goliath what does he do he goes down there and pick him up five little stones little bitty guy and listen folks they have found evidence all needed today that there were giants that live upon the Earth eight Footers 10 Footers they have found evidence science says so it didn't make no difference to David and David was different but when it got right down to it was the price that made it and today we got to reproduce that word called Jesus Christ every one of us do it and it's not something we can't attain to all we got to do is believe in taking this word right and remember that we are blessed people we're most people on this Earth folks we are it's been a pleasure to speak this morning I hope that something has come to let's break your heart a little bit and happier and I want to tell y'all if y'all don't think I love doing this it's a pleasure to stand here in this church with you and speak to you about him I know I wouldn't dare to try to match scripture with none of y'all hold it but I thank God that he's blessed me and put me here just go that's all going to be quota blessed okay pay attention to the state
