[11:39] as we look to you and believe you in
[11:41] Jesus name we pray amen amen and
[11:45] amen in St John 12 and verse
[11:51] 20 and the Bible says and there were
[11:55] certain Greeks among them that came up
[11:58] to worship at the feast
[12:00] the same came therefore to Philip which
[12:02] was of beta of Galilee and desire him
[12:05] saying sir we would see Jesus Philip
[12:10] cometh and tell Andrew and again Andrew
[12:12] and philli tell Jesus and Jesus answered
[12:16] them saying the hour is come that the
[12:19] son of man should be glorified verily
[12:22] verily I say unto you except a corn of
[12:25] weed fall into the ground and die it
[12:27] abideth alone but if it die it bringeth
[12:30] forth much fruit amen then over in verse
[12:34] 28 he said father glorify thy name then
[12:39] came there a voice from Heaven saying I
[12:42] have both glorified it and will glorify
[12:44] it again amen the people therefore that
[12:47] stood by and heard it said that it
[12:50] thunder y other say an angel spake to
[12:53] him Jesus answered and said this voice
[12:57] came not because of me but for your sake
[13:00] now is the Judgment of this world now
[13:03] shall the prince of this world be cast
[13:06] out and I if I be lifted up from the
[13:09] earth I will draw all men unto me you
[13:12] may be seated as we go to the next
[13:14] scripture this morning from Revelation
[13:17] chap 10 and we know that very well on
[13:20] verse 8
[13:30] Revelation
[13:31] 10:8 and the voice which I heard from
[13:34] Heaven spake unto me again and said go
[13:37] and take the little book which is open
[13:40] in the hands of the Angel which standed
[13:42] upon the sea and upon the Earth and I
[13:45] went unto the angel and said unto him
[13:48] give me the little book and he said unto
[13:49] me take take it and eat it up and it
[13:52] shall be make thy belly bitter but it
[13:55] shall be thy mouth sweet as hone and I
[13:58] took the little book out of the Angel's
[14:00] hand and ate it up and it was in my
[14:02] mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I
[14:05] had eaten it my belly was bitter and he
[14:08] said unto me
[14:10] thou must prophesy again before many
[14:14] people and nation and tongues and Kings
[14:17] amen I want you to note that the
[14:20] prophecy is going to be not to a a
[14:23] nation M but before many people and the
[14:27] nation and tongues and Kings therefore
[14:31] it's got to be a
[14:33] Gentiles amen so I speak this morning on
[14:37] that
[14:38] final
[14:40] voice to that final age and I know we
[14:44] believe this morning that we're at the
[14:47] end of all
[14:49] things everything is coming to an end
[14:52] exactly you know you you look at
[14:55] politics and you find that the world is
[14:57] as it were falling AP part by its
[15:00] economy right amen you know we find that
[15:03] even though in America it seems like the
[15:06] economy is stable then when you look at
[15:09] Hallelujah the deficit that they've got
[15:11] you realize this nation is in trouble
[15:14] the entire world is in trouble and when
[15:17] we look even among ourselves the message
[15:20] of the hour mean we we can see those
[15:23] prophecies coming to us all that can be
[15:27] shaken will be shaken amen that there
[15:30] are things today being said that affect
[15:33] the very core of the people's Faith
[15:37] causing them to question the word of God
[15:40] question the foundation that they stand
[15:44] upon that's right and may I quickly say
[15:46] that if you don't have the new birth if
[15:50] you're not standing on the foundation of
[15:53] the word of God what you're standing
[15:55] upon will be
[15:57] shaken amen as trying to question the
[16:01] things that we have seen and heard as a
[16:04] Vindication of our faith yeah amen but
[16:08] God knows exactly what he's doing in the
[16:11] letter in church age 364 brother Bram
[16:14] said it is
[16:16] harvestin and the two vines that grow
[16:19] together and intertwine their branch is
[16:22] now being separated oh hallelujah amen
[16:26] the fruit of these Vines which were at
[16:29] such variance will be gathered into
[16:31] separate garam the two spirits will go
[16:36] to their separate
[16:38] destination now is the time to make the
[16:42] final call that comes only to the wheat
[16:46] bride that's right the final call is to
[16:50] the bride of Christ and the Word was
[16:53] come out of her my people and be
[16:55] separate that you partake not of our
[16:58] sins Glory you know that final call is
[17:01] going to be to the bride amen you know
[17:04] the Bible says that amen when the word
[17:07] of God comes it comes in
[17:10] lightning in voices and in Thunder amen
[17:14] but we find that every time it happens
[17:17] in the scripture the true seed of God
[17:21] they did not hear thund what they heard
[17:24] was a
[17:25] voice yet the others all they heard was
[17:29] a thunder only Thunder but there is with
[17:33] the Thunder a voice of understanding
[17:36] right hallelujah amen and that voice of
[17:39] understanding can only come to them that
[17:41] have years to hear that years to years
[17:45] come by the new birth Hallelujah which
[17:49] the bride must receive amen right amen
[17:53] hallelujah amen the people heard thunder
[17:57] and today you know the question is uh
[18:00] mean why is it that we go back after so
[18:03] many years and question the foundation
[18:06] of the FI that's right you know why
[18:09] because yes to them there was a thunder
[18:12] mhm that caused a move of God are you
[18:16] there with me but there was not the
[18:18] voice of God with certainty to them but
[18:22] they can stand upon that right
[18:25] hallelujah amen brother bam said when a
[18:27] man struck an
[18:29] absolute he gives him a Vindication of
[18:32] that are you there with me amen every
[18:36] one of us here this amen this morning
[18:38] you've got to have a Vindication of your
[18:41] Fai it's not something on the outside
[18:43] that that is place there said by that no
[18:46] it is by this this is what I'm standing
[18:50] upon amen I appreciate all of that that
[18:53] brought me to a position Hallelujah but
[18:55] the word of God is n thee right and so
[18:59] we find this at the baptism of
[19:03] Jesus they hear a noise but not the
[19:07] voice of
[19:08] God are you there with me the Greeks it
[19:12] wasn't their time because the corn of
[19:16] wheat did not fall into the ground and
[19:18] die so all they heard was a thunder
[19:22] right amen but the voice came to the
[19:25] elect the people prepared at the time
[19:29] amen if you read acts 9 the the account
[19:33] of Paul amen Acts chapter 22 and Acts 26
[19:38] uh you get amen you know from the Greek
[19:41] what it says they said and they heard
[19:43] the voice but did not understand or they
[19:46] they see the light but understand all
[19:48] the voice but when they run it back it
[19:50] says they heard the the noise but heard
[19:54] not the
[19:55] voice to them it was merely a noise
[19:59] because it was not God's voice to them
[20:03] because the voice of Revelation they had
[20:06] nothing to receive it right are you
[20:09] there with me so the elect will hear the
[20:13] voice of God hallelujah in our day the
[20:16] Thunder speaks in Revelation 10 ibody
[20:20] believe that Revelation 107 to many it's
[20:24] just still a thunder all the prophet
[20:27] says you know they go back and take the
[20:29] literal word line for line and they try
[20:34] to make that match with history yeah
[20:37] they're trying to get a Vindication out
[20:40] of the literal words are you there oh
[20:43] but even Jesus telling in the volume of
[20:45] the book it is written of me hallelujah
[20:50] amen amen yes the thunder sound how many
[20:53] believe that amen but there was a truth
[20:55] to that seven Thunder in the message
[20:58] what attraction on the mountain brother
[21:00] bam said he said what happened upon upon
[21:04] Mount Sunset God confirming his word
[21:08] right right amen hallelujah he said
[21:10] that's what all the noise is about yeah
[21:13] right amen notice is God Hall fulfilling
[21:17] his promised word again of Revelation 10
[21:20] 1-7 right and in the days of the voice
[21:24] of the seven Thunder when it shall begin
[21:27] to sound the m of God should be finished
[21:32] amen that's
[21:34] right therefore it's saying that in the
[21:36] days of Revelation
[21:39] 3:14 the mystery of God will be
[21:42] completed are you there with me amen
[21:45] hallelujah now the last message to the
[21:48] lasten church age fulfill exactly in
[21:52] this age he said that's right in Luke
[21:55] 17:30 the day when the son of man is R
[21:59] amen hallelujah and in that time there
[22:02] shall arise false
[22:05] prophet amen because if you take the
[22:08] words of a Vindicated prophet and you
[22:12] begin to question that word amen it
[22:15] makes you a false prophet amen where is
[22:19] your Vindication if you can say well the
[22:23] prophet was wrong here but he was right
[22:25] here where is your
[22:27] Vindication you
[22:29] Hallelujah and there shall be Falls
[22:33] anointed
[22:34] ones yes sir who the people will have
[22:38] great respect
[22:39] for amen but when it comes down to the
[22:43] aligning of your faith they question
[22:45] what God says right Hallelujah he said
[22:49] it would deceive the very elect if it
[22:51] was possible Hallelujah yet many around
[22:55] message Circle are still puzzled
[22:58] wondering
[22:59] It Rock their fate Hallelujah me people
[23:03] are in disarray but I tell you what
[23:06] everything that can shake right will
[23:09] shake in this name yes sir amen amen and
[23:13] if your faith is on is not on Solid Rock
[23:16] it will shake amen amen right amen now
[23:21] the sounding of the seven Thunder which
[23:23] the in mystery of God of Revelation 10
[23:26] 1-7 still remain thunder in Thunder form
[23:31] to those who have not ears to hear right

[23:36] for everybody that's right it's for
[23:39] those amen that must Echo the final
[23:43] voice are you there with me right
[23:46] hallelujah amen now God the prophet says

[23:55] voice in the final hour that's right

[24:03] church ages it sounding and in each age

[24:10] righten and the Bride of that age was
[24:13] caught up by the revelation of the word
[24:15] the portion of the word for their day
[24:18] amen hallelujah amen but yet there was
[24:21] an inhal of of that in each age that was
[24:25] left off amen hallelujah amen amen
[24:28] but we we know that in the time of the
[24:31] seventh angel message all the mystery

[24:40] mystery is going to be
[24:43] finished hallelujah amen amen with the
[24:46] opening of The Seven Seals he will bring
[24:48] now the Eternal voice amen of God are
[24:52] you there with me Hallelujah into
[24:55] creative existence

[25:24] going to be a

[25:48] prophet step on the scene brother B said

[26:22] that abstract the word of God yes sir on
[26:25] the first seal

[27:18] speaks it is the voice of God are you
[27:21] there with me amen so we know what the
[27:25] Thunder is it is the voice of God but
[27:28] move it from that he said knowing the
[27:30] true anointing speak right hello right
[27:33] amen when the minister stand there with
[27:35] the true
[27:37] anointing Hallelujah that is a voice of
[27:41] God don't put it just on the prophet no
[27:43] sir but if that same anointing speak
[27:48] truth it is a voice of God to reject it
[27:52] right is to remove the
[27:56] Candlestick amen right and if you remove
[27:59] your Candlestick you've got no light
[28:02] right that's right so the path becomes
[28:05] blur right and if the path becomes blur
[28:09] then the people is in darkness and if
[28:11] the people is in darkness again the
[28:14] Bible said if the truth be hid it is it
[28:16] to them who are lost of whom the God of
[28:19] this world has blinded the minds of them
[28:23] that believe
[28:25] not hallelujah amen amen continue to
[28:29] quote he said the voice of the seven
[28:31] chch changed the voice speaking with
[28:34] thunder and
[28:36] lightning
[28:38] Hallelujah in the seventh seal 1963
[28:41] notice there was only one great burst of
[28:43] thunder and seven angels appear right is
[28:47] that right one burst of thunder seven
[28:49] angels appear and I saw the lamb when he
[28:52] open the first seal and I heard as it
[28:55] were the voice of thunder and one of the
[28:57] four Beast the comat Beast which is the
[29:00] anointing Hallelujah that brings it to
[29:02] bring it to John come and see notice one
[29:05] Thunder seven message messages that
[29:09] means sealed up and cannot be revealed
[29:12] until the last day y right he said in
[29:16] this age am amen you're in the day of

[29:47] it struck something that is there if
[29:50] there's nothing there the word goes to
[29:53] your

[29:57] can quot what what the prophet says you

[30:05] spiritual

[38:18] Doctrine if youve got the new birth
[38:20] right oh the true birth Hallelujah he
[38:24] said that's the reason Eve could do what
[38:26] she did Hallelujah with her Horn Seed

[38:35] creation
