[0:00] good morning everyone good morning
[0:01] teacher morning I
[0:12] forgot let's turn back to Genesis 5
[0:16] that's the
[0:17] butt you cut his head off at least show
[0:20] part of his
[0:28] head
[0:39] comp comparing this the the book of the
[0:42] generations of Adam was the book of the
[0:44] generations of Jesus Christ and uh just
[0:47] to finish up this
[0:49] chapter
[0:52] um we talked about how this is the
[0:54] chapter of of testifies that Adam sold
[0:57] us into
[0:58] death and Jesus redeems us um and just
[1:04] one last thing in this chapter is that
[1:06] that uh we're kind of going to get into
[1:08] numbers a little
[1:10] bit upside down your micophone
[1:14] she had a friend I have a friend
[1:21] that that's
[1:28] good um
[1:31] so how many uh how many how many
[1:34] generations are here are um wait a
[1:37] second we need to pause for a second cuz
[1:40] I need to Craig something I said last
[1:41] time hey man wait waiting on
[1:44] that uh y'all will believe what happened
[1:47] but he's going to tell you and I'll tell
[1:48] you the other part of it the other part
[1:51] yeah so last time I I I made a comment
[1:54] that that nobody had lived longer than
[1:57] it was Methuselah and then Adam which is
[1:59] incorrect
[2:00] I got I got my numbers all messed up
[2:02] it's methusa and Jared the father of
[2:05] lamec and then Noah 950 years and then
[2:08] Adam right but we go to Joseph's house
[2:12] and play Bible trivia and you want to
[2:14] believe that was a Bible trivia question
[2:18] he asked me so and I said Adam cuz you
[2:22] said it today he turned it over and it
[2:24] said
[2:26] generous Bob's face goes red who
[2:30] I said well it's all over the world now
[2:34] H I thought you
[2:38] did so I got that
[2:41] wrong I still won I still won the whole
[2:44] game that so that was unfortunate for
[2:47] the way but that you know I believe but
[2:49] no I believe it was the
[2:52] Lord I really believe it was the Lord
[2:54] did that really I mean how would you
[2:55] come up with a there's a there's a box
[2:57] of a thousand questions in that one
[3:00] question was asked who was the second
[3:02] oldest from medland right and you had
[3:05] just covered it that more so Lord I mean
[3:07] Lord C I want I want to be real careful
[3:11] because the whole word is a tapestry and
[3:13] if you mess up one thing it can offset
[3:16] everything else so it it's important to
[3:18] be sure is extremely care that's right
[3:22] um so we're looking at Genesis CH
[3:26] 5 how
[3:28] many how many Generations are here if
[3:32] you count them all up you get uh Noah's
[3:35] the last generation and then he had
[3:37] three sons ham shim and Je ja all the
[3:40] names the listed in Genesis 5 are 13 and
[3:44] um brother random talked about the
[3:46] number 13 represents that's the number
[3:49] of a woman worship of a woman and uh if
[3:52] you look at ew bullinger's book on the
[3:54] numbers in scripture he talks about how
[3:57] the number represents Rebellion from
[3:58] God's word apostasy
[4:02] corruption so uh Genesis 5 is what what
[4:07] because of Adam and Eve took upon sin in
[4:11] the garden and rebelled against God's
[4:12] word we were sold into death and um
[4:16] that's that's actually where number 13
[4:18] God is unlucky uh people treat as
[4:22] unlucky because um let's just take a
[4:24] second to look at that in scripture
[4:27] genes let's go to Genesis 14:4
[4:39] because 12 years they served ched om and
[4:41] in the 13th year they were bailed and
[4:43] remember ched om took uh lot captive and
[4:47] went and uh brought him back so in the
[4:49] 13th year they were bailed in Genesis
[4:53] 177
[4:58] 25
[5:04] Genesis
[5:05] 7825 and Ishmael his son was 13 years
[5:08] old when he was circumcised in the fles
[5:10] of his poor Skin So Isel was circumcised
[5:13] when he was 13 and then
[5:15] uh went away let see
[5:20] Jeremiah
[5:28] 253
[5:35] Jeremiah 25 3 chap the third
[5:47] verse the word that came to let's start
[5:49] at verse first the word that came to
[5:51] Jeremiah concerning all the people of
[5:52] Judah and the fourth year of je son of
[5:54] Josiah king of Judah that was the first
[5:56] year of nebuchad RAR king of Babylon the
[5:58] which Jeremiah the Prophet spake unto
[6:00] all the people of Judah and all the
[6:01] inhabitants of Jerusalem
[6:03] saying from the 13th year of Josiah the
[6:06] son of am and king of to even unto this
[6:08] day that is the 3 and 20th year the word
[6:10] of the Lord have come unto me and I have
[6:12] spoke unto you Rising early and speaking
[6:15] but ye have not hearkened 13 here spoke
[6:20] so number 13 kind of signifies reion
[6:23] against God's word and and compare that
[6:25] with what brother R said about the
[6:27] worship of a woman that America's number
[6:29] is 13 uh we got 13 strikes 13
[6:40] stars so uh Genesis 5 is is a death Adam
[6:44] was a witness live 930 years and then we
[6:47] move over to um
[6:52] Matthew I'm sorry what's the number 13
[6:55] signify Rebellion uh worship of a woman
[6:59] uh
[7:00] apostasy uh rebelling against God's word
[7:03] everything everything that the United
[7:04] States is do yes right for the
[7:07] character yes
[7:10] exactly Matthew 1 chapter one these fans
[7:14] are going speak up a little hour I don't
[7:17] have that problem but you probably
[7:19] do and I still hav't got my voice back
[7:28] quite
[7:30] now uh 13 Matthew verse one the book of
[7:35] the generations of Jesus Christ the son
[7:37] of David the son of Abraham now uh I
[7:41] have a lot of stuff I need to put
[7:43] together see all bear with
[7:46] me but the theme of this is that uh last
[7:50] time we talked about how the the ladder
[7:52] uh Jacob's Ladder was Anchored In Jesus
[7:55] Christ and um you can't anchor it in a
[7:58] man you got to Anchor It In Christ and
[8:01] uh if we're in Christ that's how that's
[8:03] how we Ascend the ladder back to Heaven
[8:07] Is by being in Christ being part of him
[8:09] and the whole uh uh the genealogy in
[8:14] Matthew and the genealogy and Luke speak
[8:16] to the promises that were made all down
[8:18] through the Old Testament of the one
[8:20] that was going to come to redeem us to
[8:22] take us back to what Adam lost
[8:26] right let's see this so we talked
[8:29] uh briefly a couple of weeks ago about
[8:32] how
[8:36] um I'm missing some
[8:39] notes I
[8:41] have that's all right U about how uh
[8:45] Matthew is presents presents him as the
[8:48] son of David and um so the theme of this
[8:52] is
[8:58] that where we're going to start
[9:12] off
[9:23] sorry here we
[9:27] go although it list has Offspring gen uh
[9:30] the the genealogy Jesus is not the
[9:34] physical offspring of Adam cuz you can't
[9:38] anchor that the ladder in him so let's
[9:42] turn uh we're the the topic is Matthew
[9:46] and Luke but let's turn to Matthew the
[9:48] 22nd
[9:54] chapter verse
[9:58] 41
[10:10] now this is this confused the Pharisees
[10:13] because they were looking for somebody
[10:14] they they always they claim to Salvation
[10:17] was their their genealogy I they said
[10:20] they were the the children of Abraham so
[10:23] uh this is this is a familiar scripture
[10:25] to us all and
[10:27] uh verse one while the Pharisees were
[10:31] gathered together Jesus asked him saying
[10:34] what think you of Christ whose son is
[10:36] he they say unto him the son of
[10:40] David he saith unto them how then do
[10:43] David in spirit call him Lord saying the
[10:46] Lord said unto my Lord sit thou on my
[10:48] right hand till I make thine enemies thy
[10:52] foot stol if David didn't call him Lord
[10:55] how is he his son and no man was able to
[10:58] answer him any word answer in my word
[11:01] neither D any man from that day forth
[11:04] ask him any more questions and think
[11:06] about that lad the Lord said unto my
[11:08] Lord the is the root and The Offspring
[11:10] so what Jesus is testifying
[11:13] is they uh this uh this the son of David
[11:17] began before David he's the root of him
[11:21] and he's The Offspring he's the author
[11:23] and finisher of our faith he's the
[11:25] beginning and the end and not just not
[11:27] just in you know how brother said Alpha
[11:29] and Omega not just the beginning but
[11:30] he's manifested his attributes all down
[11:33] through Through the
[11:35] Ages not just in the beginning or the
[11:38] end and then uh this was a very
[11:40] important part of Peter's Pentecostal
[11:43] message let's go to Acts
[11:46] 2
[11:57] 32
[12:04] acts
[12:06] 2:32 this Jesus hath God raised up
[12:09] whereof we all are witnesses therefore
[12:12] being by the right hand of God exalted
[12:14] and having received of the Father the
[12:16] promise of the Holy Ghost he hath shed
[12:18] forth this which you now see and hear
[12:21] for David is not ascended into the
[12:23] heavens but he saith himself the Lord
[12:25] said unto my Lord sit down on my right
[12:27] hand until I make thy f FES that foot St
[12:30] therefore let all the house of Israel
[12:32] know assuredly that God have made that
[12:34] same Jesus whom he have crucified both
[12:36] the Lord and Christ like David he wor he
[12:40] he uh he sacrificed heers goat sheep he
[12:44] he was under the blood of of sheep and
[12:46] goats looking forward to that day when
[12:49] Jesus blood could allow him to uh to to
[12:53] make it into heaven let bre that that
[12:55] lad like brother R said um David
[12:58] couldn't go go up he was under the shed
[13:00] blood of heers and goats and sheep but
[13:02] now he could raise he was under the
[13:03] blood of the Lord Jesus they only
[13:06] answered to that blood when it were
[13:07] coming Force when the blood of Christ
[13:09] come in force for all those who had died
[13:12] in Good favor Rose that's right and
[13:14] ascended into Glory because they rose
[13:16] with him after his his uh death or
[13:19] Resurrection um so let's look
[13:26] um ma The Book of Matthew after we
[13:28] talked about after 400 years of no
[13:31] prophets Malachi was the last prophet in
[13:33] the Book of Matthew uh was written and
[13:36] the Book of Matthew is is peculiar
[13:38] because it's the 40th book in the
[13:41] Bible
[13:43] and just to show you how perfect even
[13:47] the order of the books is is absolutely
[13:49] perfect to show to show God to manifest
[13:52] God's Will and
[13:57] uh to manifest his great
[14:01] design but before we really get started
[14:04] into the genealogy let's look at what
[14:06] the number 40 represents
[14:09] um let's turn to Psalm
[14:14] 95 verse 8 through
[14:27] 10
[14:41] the number 40 uh represents probation
[14:44] trial
[14:47] chastisement Psalm 95 8-10 Harden not
[14:50] your heart as in the provocation as in
[14:51] the days of Temptation in the wilderness
[14:54] when your fathers tempted me proved me
[14:55] and saw my work 40 years alone was I
[14:58] geve with this generation he said it is
[15:01] a people that do he in their heart and
[15:03] they have not known my ways I think
[15:05] about how this relates to the Book of
[15:07] Matthew after they they were looking at
[15:09] this king and the 40th book of the Bible
[15:11] presents the king for the Jews because
[15:14] Matthew was written from a Jewish
[15:17] perspective so think as we go through
[15:20] number 40 think about um now the 40th
[15:23] book of the Bible they're putting on
[15:25] probation what are you going to do with
[15:27] this Christ who's presented before you
[15:29] M and acts
[15:50] 13:18 about the time of 40 years
[15:52] suffered he Their Manners in the
[15:56] wilderness so he suffered they were on
[15:59] probation see what are you what are you
[16:01] going to do on trial and now let's turn
[16:04] to
[16:05] Judges chapter 3 and then we're going to
[16:09] have to go to judges 5 and then judges
[16:15] 8 so what we just looked at was 40 Years
[16:18] of probation by trial now we're going to
[16:21] look at 40 years of probation by
[16:25] Prosperity Judges chapter 3
[16:32] chapter 3 ver
[16:40] 11 and the land had rest 40 years and
[16:43] often the ill the son of KZ died so what
[16:47] what he would do is give them four a
[16:49] space of 40 Years of rest and after that
[16:53] 40 years they would start going back
[16:55] into uh idolatry and the things that
[16:56] they had come out of right and and uh
[16:59] remember ofil was I think uh Caleb's
[17:02] nephew or lady Caleb somehow I can't
[17:05] remember de let's go to judges
[17:15] 5:31 so let all thine enemies perish oh
[17:18] Lord but let them that love him be as
[17:19] the son and he goeth forth in his might
[17:22] and the land had rest 40 years now let's
[17:25] go to judges
[17:27] 8:28
[17:36] thus was median subdued before the
[17:38] children of Israel so that they lifted
[17:39] up their heads no more and the country
[17:42] was in quietness 40 years in the days of
[17:45] bean they would they would get
[17:47] Prosperity they have a time of Peace
[17:49] where they could maybe study the word
[17:52] and uh and then they would return back
[17:55] into what they would come from now let's
[17:57] uh Google 40 Years of prosperity in in
[18:01] under their kings let's go to 2 Samuel
[18:10] 5 2 Samuel
[18:26] 5 David was 30 years old when he began
[18:28] to Reign and he reigned 40 years in Hein
[18:31] he reigned over Judah 7 years and 6
[18:34] months and in Jerusalem he reigned 33 30
[18:37] and3 years over all Israel and Judah now
[18:40] if David reigned 40 years how many years
[18:43] do you think Solomon R let's go to First
[18:46] Kings
[18:57] 11:42 H do you mind repeating the verse
[19:00] one
[19:01] get First Kings First Kings
[19:04] 11 start
[19:15] 42 they get SP brother you get that
[19:18] scream
[19:21] out I was just Che yeah and I'm 68 what
[19:26] do you all expect
[19:30] First Kings 11:42 and the time that
[19:33] Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all
[19:35] Israel was 40 years and uh also there's
[19:38] a few other kings jehoash joash jobal
[19:41] and II that rained for 40 years and then
[19:43] 40 Years of
[19:45] probation of humiliation and
[19:48] servitude I'll just read this to you
[19:50] judges
[19:51] 131 and the children of Israel Israel
[19:54] did Evil again in the sight of the Lord
[19:55] and the Lord delivered them into the
[19:57] hand of the Philistines 40 years 1st
[20:00] Samuel 4:18 and it came to pass when he
[20:03] made mention of the ark that he fell
[20:05] this is Eli after he heard that the Ark
[20:06] of the Covenant had been taken and it
[20:08] came to pass when he made mention of the
[20:10] Ark of of God that he fell from off the
[20:12] seat backward by the side of the gate
[20:14] and his neck broke and he died for he
[20:16] was an old man and heavy and he had
[20:17] judged Israel 40 years and acts 13:21
[20:21] and after where they desired a king and
[20:23] God gave unto them Saul the son of sis a
[20:25] man of the tribe of Benjamin by the
[20:26] space of 40 years
[20:29] so it says in the New Testament the saw
[20:30] L for 40 years and in 40 Years of
[20:33] probation by waiting Moses in Egypt when
[20:35] he was 40 years it came to his heart to
[20:37] visit his brother and the children of
[20:38] Israel Moses and Midian when he 40 years
[20:40] were expired there appeared to him in
[20:42] the wilderness of Mount Si an angel of
[20:44] of the Lord and Flame a fire in a bush
[20:47] and then uh there's a peri eight periods
[20:51] of 40 days think by the number eight 48
[20:56] times throughout the Bible 4 40 days
[20:58] Moses was in the mount MH 40 days Moses
[21:01] was in the mount after the sin of the
[21:03] golden cast that's Deuteronomy 9:1
[21:05] 18:25 40 days of the spies issuing the
[21:08] penal sentence of the 40 years in
[21:09] numbers
[21:10] 13:26 40 Days of Elijah and or First
[21:13] Kings 198 40 days of Jonah and Nineveh
[21:16] 40 days Ezekiel lay on his right side
[21:18] that symbolized the 40 Years of judah's
[21:20] transgression 40 days Jesus was tempted
[21:23] of the devil 40 days Jesus was s of his
[21:25] disciples speaking of the things
[21:27] pertaining to the kingdom of God after
[21:28] his resurrection acts 1 12 so and
[21:33] uh let me find my little cheat Che
[21:36] uh numbers so the number eight
[21:39] represents eternity the first of a new
[21:41] series eight periods of 40 days
[21:44] testifying
[21:47] of trial and probation so now we just
[21:51] have a few more minutes
[21:57] left
[22:01] let me get back to
[22:11] Matthew so we talked about how uh was
[22:15] kind of on the theme of Jesus is not the
[22:17] natural offspring of anyone and uh you
[22:19] know he his father and mother were not
[22:22] Joseph and Mary if you're in Christ you
[22:24] know how brother talked about one day he
[22:26] realized that his mother and father will
[22:28] not Charles and Ella if you're in in
[22:30] Christ you uh you take you are his gen
[22:35] are manifested in
[22:38] you so all of the promises that uh were
[22:43] prophesied of who was to come are
[22:45] fulfilled or are spoken of in these two
[22:47] genealogies so let me read I'm just
[22:49] going to just listen you don't have to
[22:51] turn I'm going to run down through some
[22:53] of these promise prophecy Promises of
[22:56] how uh the gene theology would would
[22:58] come and Genesis 3:15 I will put imy
[23:01] between thee and the woman and between
[23:03] thy seed and her seed it shall bruise
[23:05] thy head and thou shalt bruise his he we
[23:07] know no a woman doesn't have a seed the
[23:09] seed of the woman was Christ and that
[23:11] was fulfilled in Galatians 4:4 when when
[23:13] Paul said but when the fullness of the
[23:15] time was come God sent forth his son
[23:18] made of a woman made under the law uh in
[23:21] Genesis
[23:22] 12:3 God promised that the seed would
[23:25] come through descending of Abraham and I
[23:27] will bless them that bless thee and
[23:28] curse him that curseth thee and in thee
[23:30] shall all families of the Earth Earth be
[23:32] blessed and Matthew 1:1 testifies that
[23:35] the book of the generation of Jesus
[23:37] Christ the son of David the son of
[23:38] Abraham Genesis 17:19 and God said Sarah
[23:42] thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed
[23:44] and thou shalt call his name Isaac and I
[23:46] will establish my Covenant with him and
[23:48] for an ever for an Everlasting Covenant
[23:50] and with his seed after him and Matthew
[23:53] and Luke both testify that the seed came
[23:55] through Isaac numbers 247 17 I shall see
[23:58] him but not now I Shall Behold Him but
[24:00] not nigh there shall come a star out of
[24:02] Jacob and a scepter shall rise out of
[24:05] Israel and shall Smite the corners of
[24:07] Moab and destroy all the children of sh
[24:10] and that's testifying that he come
[24:11] through
[24:13] Jacob there's a I don't have there's a
[24:16] huge list of all of these prophecies
[24:18] that testify in minute detail everything
[24:21] this uh because his word is so perfect
[24:24] not one jot or tit will pass away that's
[24:26] right Genesis 49 10 says the scepter
[24:29] shall not depart from the Judah nor a
[24:30] lawgiver from between his feet until
[24:32] Shiloh come into him shall the Gathering
[24:34] of the people be it'll come from Judah
[24:37] and we're going to look when when we go
[24:39] further on how the birth right went to
[24:42] not Judah but to Joseph right and uh so
[24:46] we're going to take a look at that later
[24:48] on as we progress but Luke 3:33
[24:51] testifies that um the son of aminadab
[24:54] which was the son of Aon which was the
[24:55] son of ezam which was the son of FZ
[24:57] which was the the son of Judah he will
[24:59] come from Judah then Isaiah 11:10 in
[25:02] that day there shall be a root of Jesse
[25:03] which shall stand for an inside of the
[25:05] people to it shall the gentille seek and
[25:07] his rest shall be glorious he's going to
[25:09] be descendant of Jesse and again and
[25:11] Romans 5:12 again Isaiah sayi it shall
[25:14] be a Ru of Jesse and he that shall rise
[25:16] to rign over the Gentiles in him shall
[25:17] the Gentiles trust Jeremiah 23 prophesy
[25:21] that behold the days come sayth the Lord
[25:23] that I will rais unto David A righteous
[25:26] branch and a king shall reign in resp
[25:28] and shall execute judgment and Justice
[25:29] in the
[25:31] earth and we we looked a couple of weeks
[25:33] ago at how the the the different
[25:35] Prophecies of who the branch would be
[25:37] that he would be the king and a servant
[25:39] just like these four Matthew Mark Luke
[25:42] and John present him as those four uh
[25:45] present him in those four ways just like
[25:47] in the uh the Tabernacle the four
[25:51] pillars presented the uh the veil with
[25:54] the Tans on it presenting
[25:56] him as
[25:58] lion ox man and Eagle Isaiah 9:7 said
[26:04] let me finish reading that number four
[26:06] in his days Judah shall be saved and
[26:08] Israel shall dwell safely and in this is
[26:10] his name whereby he shall be called the
[26:12] Lord our righteousness Isaiah 9:7 said
[26:15] of the increase of his government and
[26:17] peace there shall be no end upon the
[26:19] throne of David and upon his kingdom to
[26:21] order it and to establish it with
[26:23] judgment and with Justice from hence
[26:24] forth even forever the Zeal of the Lord
[26:27] of po to perform this he's an heir to
[26:29] the throne of
[26:31] David so the the genealogy is to present
[26:34] him but he's not
[26:37] actually connected by genes his father
[26:40] and mother are not Joseph and
[26:44] Mary and our spiritual father and mother
[26:48] are not anyone of the flesh right but
[26:50] God
[26:52] um let's see let's
[26:56] uh
[27:01] let's look at uh as you go down through
[27:05] the genealogy you'll come to jeah so
[27:08] let's turn to Jeremiah
[27:12] 22:30 we know God promised David that
[27:16] you
[27:19] never Jeremiah
[27:21] 23:30 223 that's what I said
[27:26] 22 oh
[27:29] 22 or 23
[27:47] come let me see if I
[27:54] start let's start at verse 24 Jeremiah
[27:58] 22 verse
[28:00] 24 as I live sayith the Lord the kah the
[28:03] son of jeim King of king of Judah with a
[28:06] signant upon my right hand yet would I
[28:08] pluck thee th and I will give thee into
[28:11] the hand of them that seek thy life and
[28:13] into the hand of them whose face thou
[28:16] fearest even into the hand of nib razar
[28:18] king of Babylon and into the hand of the
[28:21] calans and I will cast thee out and thy
[28:24] mother that bear thee into another
[28:25] country where you were not born there
[28:27] shall you die but to the land whereinto
[28:30] they desire to return thither shall they
[28:32] not return is this man
[28:36] kah he K jeah went by the name kah and
[28:40] jeah is this man kah a despised broken
[28:43] Idol is he a vessel wherein is no
[28:45] pleasure wherefore are they cast out he
[28:48] and his seed and are cast into a land
[28:50] which they know not oh Earth Earth Earth
[28:53] hear the word of the Lord thus sayith
[28:54] the Lord right ye this man childless a
[28:57] man that shall not prosper in his days
[28:59] for no man of his seed shall prosper
[29:01] sitting upon the throne of David and
[29:03] ruling anymore in Judah this is the last
[29:06] king of of Judah uh there were no more
[29:10] kings that came forth from J from
[29:14] Janiah and we know Nebuchadnezzar put uh
[29:17] zedekiah in charge zedekiah was jeanah
[29:20] Uncle no there are no Kings after zaniah
[29:24] that proceeded from this genealogy now
[29:27] so it looks like genealogy stopped
[29:29] where's the where's God's promise to
[29:32] David and the God's promise to David was
[29:34] fulfilled in Christ because he came to
[29:37] set up a new kingdom not a kingdom of
[29:38] the Earth but a spiritual Kingdom and
[29:41] that's what we stop for
[29:48] now thank
[29:51] you I'll set here go
[29:56] ahead
[29:59] know
