[2:14] ever since he it feel good
[2:35] well what I wanted to say was I don't
[2:37] know how many of y'all know it but this
[2:38] morning when Brother Sam mentioned about
[2:41] five or six people or things being
[2:43] raised from the dead I was one of those
[2:47] and I wanted to share that with you
[2:48] because Dean had give his testimony
[2:50] because he prayed over me and I come
[2:53] back to this world that's right but what
[2:55] I wanted to do was give my own testimony
[2:58] and tell you and show you how the devil
[3:00] just can slip up you when everything is
[3:02] going great I was at my father's I was
[3:07] cooking soup for him I was bagging it up
[3:10] I was standing there in the kitchen had
[3:11] one of the best felt the best that I
[3:13] felt and I don't know when because I've
[3:14] had a lot of health problems in the last
[3:17] year or two and I was standing there and
[3:19] I was bagging up the soup you know and
[3:21] feeling real good and all of a sudden I
[3:23] felt this little drip on my nose and I
[3:25] thought hm I better stop here that's
[3:28] going to go in the soup I better stop
[3:30] and do something about this I just
[3:31] assumed it was sinus well I looked at it
[3:34] on my hand cuz you know how you'll do
[3:35] that and I looked down and it was blood
[3:38] on my hand and uh so it it kept dripping
[3:42] and I finally had you know I had to had
[3:44] to quit that and I went in there and
[3:46] Dean we have a place down where my
[3:48] father lives at and he was over in our
[3:51] camper and I've had nose beds all my
[3:53] life you know problems and uh so I went
[3:57] in there and I you know done all the
[4:00] laying down and that stuff and I was
[4:01] laying on the sofa with a little ice
[4:03] thing on my nose and I called Dean over
[4:05] at the camper and I said hey I'm laying
[4:08] here with a nose bleed I had had one of
[4:10] these in a long time I just thought I'd
[4:12] update you what I'm doing you know still
[4:15] everything was was fine I thought so I
[4:19] laid there a little while and it
[4:20] wouldn't stop so Dean come over there
[4:22] and he said well maybe you better call
[4:24] the doctor so I call the doctor and ask
[4:26] them what should I do and they give you
[4:28] the same old thing you I'll hold you
[4:29] your head back and do this and count to
[4:31] 10 and all this stuff and if it doesn't
[4:33] work then you know maybe you ought to go
[4:35] to the emergency room well i' done that
[4:38] for about 15 or 20 minutes trying to get
[4:40] it to stop it wouldn't stop it was just
[4:43] flowing not real bad but enough that you
[4:46] know I couldn't get it it wouldn't stop
[4:48] so Dean said well we better go on home
[4:50] then and we'll go by Athens Regional and
[4:53] my father lives about what's it about 40
[4:56] miles I guess to Athens Regional well
[4:59] well forun well we thought about going
[5:02] to Watkinsville because it's an urgent
[5:03] care in Watkinsville so we were going
[5:05] through
[5:06] Greensboro which was about 12 miles from
[5:09] my father's house and fortunately they
[5:11] have a hospital there well
[5:14] about we're about 45 miles up the road
[5:17] and my nose was bleeding so it was
[5:20] clotting it was within two or three
[5:23] miles of the hospital I just had blood
[5:26] everywhere and it was just choking me I
[5:30] could I couldn't breathe it was choking
[5:31] me so and I told Dean I said Dean I
[5:33] don't think I'm gonna make it to Athens
[5:35] he said I know he said we're going to
[5:36] Greensboro to the hospital so we got to
[5:39] greensbor got in there the doctors tried
[5:43] to stop it they put a balloon up in my
[5:45] head and blew it up and um then they had
[5:49] me walk around a little bit say if it
[5:51] had stopped well I thought it stopped
[5:53] and then that we were washing me up cuz
[5:55] I had blood all over me so they were
[5:57] washing me up and as I I was washing it
[6:01] broke loose again started bleeding again
[6:03] just gushing and the doctor said well
[6:06] you know the balloon will probably hold
[6:08] it till you get to Athens but you really
[6:09] need to see an ENT said you need to go
[6:11] on to Athens so we went to Athens well
[6:14] by the time we got to Athens it had
[6:17] slowed down we went to the emergency
[6:18] room there and the doctor said well I
[6:20] don't want to disturb it because maybe
[6:23] it's sealed off now whatever is going on
[6:26] so they told me to go on home if it
[6:28] started up again come back well we went
[6:30] home about I guess it's about 1 or 2:00
[6:34] in the morning I woke up got up to go to
[6:37] the bathroom while I was in the bathroom
[6:40] it broke loose big time all over again
[6:43] just gushing so Dean you know gets up
[6:46] and we go head back to Athens Regional
[6:49] we get to Athens
[6:50] Regional they take me in they take that
[6:53] balloon out of my head then they put two
[6:56] in there up in there and they put one up
[6:58] in here all the way weon there and then
[7:00] another one and they inflate them
[7:02] separately and they inflated it so bad
[7:05] that they thought it had damaged my head
[7:08] that my nose would never be normal again
[7:10] they had to blow it up so and uh so
[7:14] anyway by that time it was like 6 or 7
[7:17] o'clock in the morning and they wanted
[7:19] me to see an ENT not just the emergency
[7:21] room doctor so they made arrangements
[7:22] for us to leave the hospital go across
[7:25] the street to an
[7:27] ENT so we got over there and he didn't
[7:30] want to of course disturb those two
[7:31] balloons but he was real concerned about
[7:33] them inflating them so large it was
[7:36] still seeping blood but it had stopped
[7:39] enough that he did not want to bother
[7:41] him so anyway when he finished examining
[7:44] me then we were walking out which was
[7:47] only maybe as far from here not even to
[7:49] the double doors back there and uh I was
[7:53] standing there and I told Dean I said
[7:54] Dean I said I feel strange I said I'm
[7:58] going to lean up here against the wall
[7:59] wall for a
[8:01] moment last thing I remember and I went
[8:04] out and he caught me before I hit the
[8:07] floor and as I was there on the floor I
[8:11] remember nothing except when I woke up I
[8:13] don't know exactly how long I was out um
[8:17] but it's just like a space in time now I
[8:20] don't remember anything about that I
[8:23] remember when I woke up and first thing
[8:26] I saw was Dean he was standing there and
[8:29] um
[8:30] then they the doctor had called an
[8:32] ambulance and Dean it said that the
[8:33] doctor was trying to get a pulse in my
[8:35] neck that he was screaming and holler
[8:37] called the EMTs but I know that I had
[8:41] left this world I have that space and I
[8:44] I I don't remember anything about it but
[8:47] I remember waking up and opening up my
[8:49] eyes and I saw my beloved one there
[8:52] standing over me and he prayed over me
[8:55] and I truly believe that's why I'm here
[8:58] today because he he took initiative and
[9:01] he said Lord he knew that that was the
[9:03] only help that we had and he went to the
[9:07] Lord for me and that's why I'm here
[9:20] today I'm sorry uh I just felt like I'll
[9:24] make this quick I was one of the other
[9:26] people that had been raised from the
[9:28] dead that's right
[9:30] uh as y'all know uh had some heart
[9:34] issues in my life one night I got up and
[9:37] I walked in the bathroom it 2:30 in the
[9:40] morning and the last thing I remembered
[9:45] was I was trying to breathe and it felt
[9:48] like somebody grabbed my heart when it
[9:50] contracted and locked it and it wouldn't
[9:54] wouldn't open back up and the last thing
[9:57] I remembered I was trying to take breath
[10:00] in but it was being driven out of me and
[10:01] I just H
[10:03] and that's the last thing I remembered
[10:05] and I'd always thought that maybe I'd
[10:08] have a heart attack one day and I said
[10:09] well if I did when I go down I'd try
[10:13] like a cattle with a stun gun I just
[10:15] went out busted my lip open on the
[10:17] vanity in the bathroom that's the last
[10:19] thing and it felt like when that locked
[10:21] up it felt like something shot up and
[10:23] blew the top of my head
[10:25] off I'm convinced my heart was locked
[10:27] and it wasn't beaten
[10:29] amen that's right Margaret my wife heard
[10:32] it and she came into the bathroom she
[10:34] said she called to me she said no motion
[10:37] she reached down rolled me back rolled
[10:39] me over she said whes on my eyes I saw
[10:42] she could see my pupils were rolled up
[10:44] in my head and she said Gary nothing and
[10:48] she said she wrapped her arms around me
[10:50] and said Lord Jesus help him and she
[10:52] said Gary my eyes roll back in my head I
[10:55] set up and went what happened I'm

[21:34] come Open the Eyes of My Heart
[21:38] Lord we got one more
[21:40] testimony where you at sister
[21:48] Anna well you know I've just waited too
[21:52] long to come up and praise the Lord for
[21:54] what he's done for me but one thing I'm
[21:57] sure of right now
[22:00] if I don't testify I may not be here
[22:03] next week okay because of the goodness
[22:06] of God that he brought me through this
[22:08] problem with my heart to start with and
[22:12] never knowing anything was really wrong
[22:14] and to me I'm just a person that just
[22:18] goes right at things a mile a minute and
[22:21] say forget it I'm going I'm doing this
[22:23] I'm doing this I'm doing this but anyway
[22:26] it came to
[22:27] where I I didn't have much strength I
[22:30] didn't have much energy and I knew
[22:32] something was wrong but I came to
[22:34] brother Dale and I told him I said
[22:37] Brother Sam they're trying to tell me
[22:38] something's wrong with my heart and I
[22:39] said I don't believe it I said I just
[22:42] don't believe it so when I went in and
[22:45] they did the
[22:46] caiz I expected them to maybe put a
[22:49] stint in send me home well when I got
[22:51] there they said you're not going
[22:53] anywhere so I needed a triple
[22:57] bypass um
[22:59] anyway I said well I was on drugs anyway
[23:01] I didn't know what what I was telling
[23:03] them
[23:04] anyway but I went ahead and had it done
[23:07] so when I come out and I was in ICU I'm
[23:11] going to tell you what all I can tell
[23:14] you
[23:15] people is the
[23:17] wonderful goodness of God because I
[23:21] didn't have to come out of that you know
[23:23] God could have just took me on with him
[23:27] right then and there but he didn't and I
[23:30] came into that ICU the most
[23:33] wonderfullest people there to take care
[23:36] of me when I got into the
[23:39] room it w it was all so funny in a lot
[23:42] of
[23:43] respects because I was drugged up and
[23:46] you know you know tell them what you say
[23:47] and what you do you know
[23:50] um and I lose my thoughts when I want to
[23:53] say something and that that's one bad
[23:55] thing but God has just been
[23:58] so good that he would bring me out of
[24:02] that but I do remember this one thing
[24:04] they had to give me a a unit of blood
[24:07] and so I was sitting up in the chair
[24:09] before when they were trying to warm it
[24:11] up and get it ready and I sat there and
[24:13] I told the little girl I said let me
[24:16] have that before you hook it up and put
[24:19] it in me and so I took it and I was
[24:22] rubbing it in my hands and I said father
[24:24] God I just plead the blood of Jesus over
[24:28] this Blood I said if there's anything
[24:31] there wrong with it Lord I said you just
[24:33] cleanse it before it comes into me and
[24:36] then she took it and put it back up on
[24:38] the rack and put it in me and I said I

[30:15] Christ's name I pray amen amen I want to
[30:19] turn over to uh uh Matthew the 24th
[30:23] chapter the 15th through the 18th verse
[30:27] amen
[30:29] and I want to speak a little bit about
[30:31] uh the sermon brother bam preached
[30:32] called the anointed ones at the end time
[30:35] but you know I want to take it in a
[30:36] little different
[30:38] avenue he talked about the anointed ones
[30:40] at the end time and he really emphasized
[30:43] how the denominations in the world has
[30:46] has gotten anointed to take the people
[30:48] away from the
[30:50] word but I recognize that in that title
[30:53] anointed ones at the end time there are
[30:56] true anointed Glory and the true
[30:58] anointed is the bride of Christ that'll
[31:01] come into His into his presence and
[31:03] that'll become Anointed with his Spirit
[31:06] Anointed with the Holy Ghost which we
[31:08] all claim we got and then produce
[31:12] exactly that book of Acts that that was
[31:15] to come after the first anointing of
[31:17] that holy spirit amen so we want to talk
[31:20] about these things and I recognize that
[31:23] uh that uh uh I just been hearing those
[31:26] testimonies he's doing that amen he's
[31:30] just doing that for us amen we're so
[31:32] grateful amen Matthew
[31:36] 24 15th verse onto the uh 28th
[31:42] verse then ye therefore shall see the
[31:46] abomination of desolation spoken of by
[31:49] Daniel the Prophet standing in the Holy
[31:52] place whosoever readeth let him
[31:55] understand now I don't know brother has
[31:58] been to Israel right and you saw the
[32:00] mosque of Omar there and all that so
[32:03] that's that's there right now amen uh
[32:06] hasn't been taken
[32:07] down uh Temple has not been rebuilt but
[32:11] we recognize that we're at the season
[32:14] and the time when the gospel will go
[32:16] back to the Jews and this gen spile
[32:18] dispensation will be over but it's over
[32:22] as the bride is returned back to into
[32:24] the presence of almighty God or into the
[32:26] wedding suppers amen and that's when the
[32:29] bride has made herself ready we're here
[32:31] we're here in that we can say this day
[32:34] those scriptures are being fulfilled
[32:37] amen so let let let us okay the 16th
[32:40] verse then let let them which are in
[32:44] Judea flee unto the mountains now we
[32:47] remember that this was when Rome took
[32:49] over Jerusalem let them which are in J
[32:51] in Judea flee into the mountains let
[32:53] them which are on the hill housetops
[32:57] come
[32:58] not down to take the things out of the H
[33:01] out of his house neither let them which
[33:04] which is in the field uh return back to
[33:09] take the his his clothes and who and woe
[33:14] unto them that are with ch child and
[33:18] them that which give suck in those
[33:21] days but pray that ye your flight be not
[33:25] in the winter neither in the Sabbath day
[33:28] for then shall Great Tribulation such
[33:31] as such was not since the beginning of
[33:35] the beginning of the world till this
[33:38] time nor ever shall be and except those
[33:42] days should be shortened there shall be
[33:44] no flesh saved but for the elect sake
[33:49] those days shall be shortened remember
[33:52] that's when Titus took over Jerusalem
[33:54] and that has uh that that that that's a
[33:57] a bygone time an event that has happened
[34:00] back in the past but now we move on to
[34:04] uh uh the rest of the of the scripture
[34:07] there now we're looking at Matthew 24 to
[34:10] the 28th verse Okay then if if any man
[34:14] shall say unto you Lo here is Christ or
[34:19] there or there believe it not for there
[34:24] shall be false Christ and false prophets
[34:27] and they shall shall show
[34:29] great signs and wonders in so much that
[34:33] if it were possible they should deceive
[34:35] the very
[34:37] elect Belo uh behold I have told you
[34:41] before wherefore if ye say unto if they
[34:45] say unto you he is in the desert go not
[34:50] forth behold he is in a secret chamber
[34:53] believe it not for as the lightning
[34:57] cometh out of the East and shineth unto
[34:59] the West so shall also the coming of the
[35:02] son of man be for
[35:05] whosoever wheresoever the carcass is
[35:08] there shall the Eagles be gathered
[35:10] together
[35:12] amen now we realize you can be be
[35:16] seated we realize as we look at the at
[35:20] the anointed ones here that he's talking
[35:22] about at the end time and they're
[35:23] telling you uh may call you to go out to
[35:25] the Wilderness to follow a message or a
[35:28] Ministry while like Jimmy Jones maybe uh
[35:31] was telling his people or to go out to
[35:34] Guyana or or like the others who who
[35:37] might say well he's in this secret
[35:38] Chambers or or come to our church he's
[35:41] only in here you know nobody else has
[35:43] got him they're trying to tell you you
[35:45] know if you recognize the word of God
[35:48] tells you that uh Christ doesn't isn't
[35:50] going to present himself in that way
[35:53] he's going to present himself out in the
[35:55] open like the lightning shineth from the
[35:57] East and goes over to the West it's not
[36:00] done in secret right you know uh if you
[36:03] start looking at the message of hour it
[36:05] was not done in secret amen exactly uh
[36:09] presidents and and and and and and and
[36:12] and and great men knew about the knew
[36:14] about the moving of this word of God but
[36:17] we caught up in our denominations never
[36:19] knew it really happened never knew that
[36:22] God's presence has come on the scene and
[36:24] in our day and age I was what uh
[36:29] maybe let's see I was born in
[36:33] 57 so I had a few years that brother
[36:37] Brandon was on the scene you know during
[36:40] my my lifetime and yet most of us never
[36:45] really were in those meetings we were
[36:48] never seeing the presence of the Holy
[36:50] Ghost du The Works he was doing you know
[36:53] when uh when I I was I I I've been uh
[36:57] going through all the prayer lines and
[37:00] as I'm listening through the prayer
[37:01] lines I'm seeing brother brandham speak
[37:04] to somebody and tell them about the
[37:06] secrets and intenses of their heart and
[37:08] speaking the very details of how their
[37:11] sickness has come about how it's going
[37:13] to and how it's going to go away when
[37:15] the Holy Spirit comes by to tell him and
[37:17] then he turns around and
[37:19] says did did I whatever I said was it
[37:22] true you know he didn't even remember
[37:25] what he just finished saying and you
[37:28] start to wonder well what is it and then
[37:30] I I recognize it was Jesus Christ using
[37:34] his lips using his thinking to say the
[37:37] things he was saying to where he
[37:39] couldn't even remember what was being
[37:41] said right so you start to recognize
[37:45] then is wh what are we saying that
[37:48] brother Brandon was an anointed one in
[37:52] this end
[37:53] time but now uh can we say that that's
[37:57] the the only thing there is can we say
[38:00] that's the only message that's been
[38:01] brought in our day and age that that
[38:03] only brother brandham had the Holy Ghost
[38:06] like that or does it come to a time when
[38:09] he said that we're supposed to have the
[38:12] very same spirit that raised Christ Jes
[38:16] like the song you're just saying that
[38:17] raised Christ Jesus from the dead dwells
[38:20] in you when it dwells in you it'll
[38:23] Quicken your mortal bodies but not only
[38:26] that it'll use your body to identify to
[38:31] a Dying World of a living Christ The
[38:35] Living Christ that lives in you and the
[38:37] living Christ is still still doing his
[38:39] work in this day and age right amen so
[38:42] when we start to look at the anointed
[38:45] the anointed ones at the end time of
[38:48] course we know of the false teachers we
[38:51] know of the what the denomination has
[38:53] tried to portray and present to you and
[38:56] they're coming to A place where there
[38:58] like like brother uh Dale was mentioning
[39:01] where they will show signs and
[39:03] wonders where they will receive
[39:07] power you say holy ghost power they'll
[39:10] Channel holy ghost power to do miracles
[39:15] to present to you a false
[39:18] Doctrine and the anointed ones at the
[39:21] end time that's what they've done
[39:22] throughout all ages jambers and jambers
[39:25] weren't throwing out those snakes under
[39:29] witchcraft they were using the power of
[39:32] God
[39:33] Amen they were producing the very same
[39:36] things Moses was
[39:38] doing but under a false teaching right
[39:42] right amen balum balum came by he was
[39:47] okay uh uh giving the right
[39:50] sacrifices the right the the the the
[39:53] right the the uh clean clean sacri IES
[39:57] the right he was doing they were doing
[39:59] everything according to the word of God
[40:02] to present a false
[40:04] teaching and and and knowing the
[40:07] underlying things about this message
[40:11] about the message of Moses about the
[40:13] message of coming from the of The Exodus
[40:16] knowing the very right things and
[40:18] knowing what the people were called to
[40:21] he teaches baac yeah to this is how
[40:24] you'll defeat Israel he taught them look
[40:28] just get your women to go out with them
[40:30] men right exactly get intermingle the
[40:34] world into your into your into your into
[40:38] the church into the into the called out
[40:41] ones intermingle the world into it and
[40:44] you'll defeat them and they
[40:46] did and they did so where are we
[40:49] standing in this day and age if we want
[40:52] to intermingle the world into what we
[40:56] know as a message of this hour we'll
[40:59] find the same problems we'll start to
[41:03] lack in our faith the way they lacked in
[41:05] their faith you know uh uh uh we we
[41:09] recognize that that that ever since
[41:11] since the days of Noah or or before the
[41:14] days of Noah when the sons of God saw
[41:16] that the that the that the world was
[41:19] fair the daughters of of man were
[41:22] fair that was that was what it what it
[41:24] was intermingling and getting in getting
[41:27] in amongst
[41:29] unbelieving starting to unbelieve
[41:32] yourself you know the brother said go go
[41:35] look at that believe the
[41:37] sign you know uh you know I I looked a
[41:41] little bit of it and I said I wouldn't
[41:44] waste my time that's right I wouldn't
[41:47] waste my time listening to what they got
[41:49] to say about what I know is a Vindicated
[41:53] prophet of God of this hour cuz they
[41:56] don't got nothing nothing to say I mean
[41:59] they wouldn't say it to his face cuz the
[42:01] angel of God was standing right there
[42:03] Chicago look at what Chicago was in
[42:05] Chicago when when when when when when
[42:08] the prophet of God stood there and says
[42:12] you had it out for me you guys want to
[42:15] call me out on the Trinity on these
[42:17] things he says now bring your Bible and
[42:20] stand right here and disprove what God
[42:23] has revealed this the serpent seed and
[42:25] all this show br your Bible and stand
[42:28] right here and and try and dispute or
[42:30] disprove anything that I've said that is
[42:32] right in the word of God not one of them
[42:35] got up why because they knew for a fact
[42:39] that the angel of the Lord was standing
[42:40] there and he'd have smot them
[42:43] dead see so where is it we're looking at
[42:46] a day and age when they dare to speak
[42:50] now they dared to call brother brandham
[42:53] I mean they dared to to come back and
[42:55] say that he had a lustful spirit over
[42:57] Marilyn Monro and when when when when
[43:01] you
[43:02] recognize you recognize that almighty
[43:06] God was working in the message of this
[43:09] hour vindicating the word of God for
[43:12] this hour to bring a bride to a
[43:13] rapturing faith right and you want to
[43:16] just disprove any of the things that God
[43:18] has said in this day and age to bring
[43:20] you
[43:21] there if you're going to believe that
[43:23] stuff well you know they're going to
[43:25] they're going you may as well well go
[43:27] join the Catholics that's correct amen
[43:29] it's the same am I mean uh uh I mean you
[43:34] can just go ahead and go go to any
[43:36] Dogma so what is it anointed anointed
[43:40] ones at the end time falsely anointed
[43:43] what are we looking at what's coming
[43:46] look at what what what's coming on the
[43:48] scene now coming on the scene we
[43:52] recognize that is there has to be a
[43:55] falling away before the coming of the
[43:58] Lord and it's not a I mean if if if we
[44:02] look at a fall way we're not going to
[44:04] all if if if anybody's going to fall
[44:06] away from this message it's not to go
[44:08] join the
[44:09] denominations the denominations don't
[44:11] have anything
[44:13] right but to lose faith in the very God
[44:18] that's doing the work in your day and
[44:20] hour would or or or let you just lean
[44:24] over a little bit towards the world and
[44:26] the things of the world
[44:27] rather than staying with the truth what
[44:29] God's revealing to you in your
[44:31] day amen recognizing that hey now maybe
[44:35] I can't have faith you know maybe I
[44:38] maybe I can I'll have to go the way of
[44:40] the doctors and believe that the
[44:42] Cancer's going to overtake me you know
[44:45] lose the
[44:46] faith right see this message to bring
[44:49] back the faith that was once delivered
[44:52] to the
[44:53] Saints what's the faith that was once
[44:56] delivered to S go to to Hebrews 11 right
[44:59] I mean Hebrews 11 the whole
[45:02] thing excuse me in Hebrews 11 the whole
[45:06] thing it's goes to telling you what
[45:08] people were built out of in those days
[45:11] what they suffered in those days to
[45:13] stand for God's word for their
[45:17] hour for your hour what are you standing
[45:20] for amen and and what what is this what
[45:25] do we look at signs and wonders in so
[45:28] much that if it were possible they would
[45:31] deceive the very elect Matthew
[45:35] 5
[45:37] uh uh 4-7 I mean four four and five
[45:41] Matthew 4
[45:43] 5 four and five I think it
[45:49] is
[45:52] amen Matthew
[45:55] 5 oh excuse me 4 4 Matthew
[46:03] 5:45 that ye may that ye may be the
[46:06] children of your father which is in
[46:09] heaven for he for he maketh the son to
[46:13] rise on the evil and on the good and
[46:17] sendeth the rain on the just and the
[46:20] unjust now when when the rain when the
[46:23] when now now look when we when we look
[46:25] at the rain coming
[46:28] we look at we look at at at at that
[46:30] Vision that brother brandham had at the
[46:32] at the um at The Greens Mill and there
[46:36] at The Greens Mill he turned over he
[46:38] turned over to to the scripture in in
[46:40] Hebrews where this where the rain cometh
[46:43] on the just and the unjust and he sees
[46:45] cuz he had that question of how is it
[46:47] that there's a man filled with the Holy
[46:50] Ghost that's committing adultery yeah
[46:54] and and and and and still prophesying
[46:57] and prophesying truth and there's a man
[47:00] that is truly filled with the holy
[47:04] ghost prophesying from the Holy Ghost
[47:08] and interpreting and tongues tongues
[47:10] interpreting back and forth and and and
[47:12] it being Vindicated he could tell by his
[47:15] his his by by by what God had given him
[47:18] as a gift he could tell it was a true
[47:21] prophecy and he says well how how is it
[47:24] that this man he says I thought I was
[47:26] amongst
[47:27] and then I start thinking I'm amongst
[47:29] Devils because the the man had a had had
[47:33] the wrong kind of life
[47:35] right and this scripture came up and
[47:39] said it it it comes it's it's the power
[47:43] of the Holy Ghost comes down to
[47:46] anoint in an age in a day and age and
[47:49] it'll anoint the good and the
[47:52] evil now you see why are the people that
[47:58] are preaching these falsehoods getting
[48:01] such a
[48:02] following that's right because there's a
[48:05] certain
[48:06] time because there's a certain season as
[48:10] the Bride Comes to a rapturing faith as
[48:14] the brides coming to the point where
[48:16] they got to uh H uh maybe maybe they'll
[48:20] go to the uh you could
[48:22] say I've been having a few dreams and
[48:25] they've been bothering me pretty much
[48:26] because I've been dreaming that I'm I'm
[48:29] I'm in Hitler's concentration
[48:31] camps and I'm fearing for my wife
[48:34] fearing for her good and realizing that
[48:38] and and then as I'm going through this
[48:40] and and and they're they're they're
[48:42] they're like um I don't know what
[48:44] they're doing they're like unloading Us
[48:45] From a Train sending us into into
[48:48] something or or or or or or or into into
[48:52] a gas chamber or something and I'm
[48:54] saying well I I'm I'm fearing for her
[48:57] she's gotten pulled away from me I'm
[48:59] fearing for her and then something comes
[49:03] rising up in me and says this bride of
[49:06] this day and age won't go down like the
[49:10] first one they won't go to the Lion's
[49:13] dence like the first ones say they'll
[49:16] take their stand for the word of God for
[49:18] their day and they'll believe by
[49:21] faith and then I started
[49:24] saying those bullets have no power over
[49:29] me I started I started I say th those
[49:33] those you know these these soldiers have
[49:35] no power over
[49:37] me and just as I was saying that I woke
[49:41] up from the dream I said my gosh what I
[49:45] fear and then I started realizing you
[49:47] know what we're in a day and age you
[49:51] guys all saw the uh or or have heard
[49:53] that the pope is already trying to
[49:55] preach or coming in to on a video to
[49:59] Pentecostal people right oh yeah right
[50:02] can't remember what the name of that
[50:03] Minister was but okay he's he's trying
[50:07] to gather
[50:09] in Gather in his interest was John Paul
[50:14] Pope John Paul two popes before had a
[50:23] vastedge all the denominations
[50:26] this second one had the same interest
[50:30] and he came and apologized to All
[50:33] America for what the priests had done to
[50:35] the to to people and all this stuff and
[50:38] he said then the Catholic Church will
[50:42] recompense and oh everybody was so happy
[50:45] about that now this one's coming in to
[50:48] the Pentecostal churches and saying
[50:51] we're all one we've all made mistakes in
[50:55] our past but we're all under God and
[50:58] we're all one and the people are just
[51:00] swallowing Hook Line and Sinker why
[51:03] because there's they have no word of God
[51:06] showing what the real underlying right
[51:11] reasoning for the whole thing is right
[51:14] and they they they say oh oh everybody
[51:17] says oh sure you're welcome here we're
[51:19] welcome there and on on and on well you
[51:22] know where it's coming from because it's
[51:25] it's come time
[51:27] has come time for the Beast to exercise
[51:30] her power right and gain the confidence
[51:35] of the false prophet that's correct and
[51:37] then after the false prophet well he's
[51:39] going to have the power that the Beast
[51:42] had in the original to put the pressure
[51:45] on the true bride of Christ or the false
[51:48] or or even the the what is called The
[51:51] Remnant right that that will be here as
[51:54] we look at the Book of Revelation so
[51:56] we're standing here and we look so where
[52:00] I just went to the scripture where was I
[52:03] uh Matthew
[52:05] 5 okay now let's go over to uh Hebrews
[52:10] 6
[52:14] 1-8 Hebrews 6
[52:18] 1-8 hallelujah how many appreciate the
[52:21] Lord yes sir amen how many believe that
[52:23] we're standing in a day and hour that
[52:25] this bride will prove that well this
[52:28] bride will will find herself ready amen
[52:31] we're looking at a day and hour uh
[52:33] Hebrews 6
[52:35] 1-8 okay therefore leaving the
[52:39] principles of the doctrines of of the
[52:41] doctrine of Christ remember it says
[52:43] Doctrine not doctrines doctrine of
[52:46] Christ not
[52:47] christs the doctrine of Christ letting
[52:51] let us go unto Perfection not laying
[52:54] again the foundation of repentance rep
[52:56] and and uh repentance
[53:02] from wait Foundation of
[53:08] repentance of from dead works and and of
[53:12] Faith towards
[53:14] God for the of the doctrines of baptism
[53:19] and of laying on of hands and of the
[53:22] resurrection of the dead and eternal
[53:25] judgment and all all these things we
[53:27] will we we do for God if God permits
[53:33] for for it is impossible for those who
[53:37] were once enlightened and have tasted of
[53:40] the Heavenly gift not gifts of the
[53:43] Heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[53:46] the Holy Ghost and having uh having
[53:51] taste tasted of the good word of God and
[53:54] the powers of the world to come
[53:57] if they were to fall away to renew them
[54:01] again unto repentance seeing They
[54:05] Crucified to themselves the Son of God
[54:08] aresh and put him to an open shame for
[54:11] the Earth which drinketh up the rain and
[54:15] cometh upon the rain that cometh upon it
[54:18] and beareth forth herbs meat for them
[54:22] who for whom it was dressed receive a
[54:24] blessing of God but for them which
[54:29] beareth thorns and and Briars is
[54:32] rejected and nigh unto cursing whose end
[54:36] is to be burned so whose end is to be
[54:40] burned but beloved we are not we are
[54:43] persuaded that that we are
[54:48] persuaded better things for you and the
[54:52] things that
[54:53] are um accompanied
[54:57] y accompanied salvations through
[55:01] through though we thus speak though we
[55:06] thus speak so we recognize that those
[55:11] you know almighty God has brought us to
[55:14] a place where as the word of God has
[55:17] been
[55:18] administered and the Holy Spirit has
[55:21] been freely given to the bride of Christ
[55:24] for this day and age
[55:27] to whoever wants the Holy Ghost has an
[55:31] opportunity to go before God and ask him
[55:35] and he'll give him the Holy Ghost to
[55:37] turn
[55:38] away to to turn away from what God's
[55:41] revealed in this day and hour the truth
[55:43] that God's given to our to us as as
[55:46] Believers would cause us to just uh uh
[55:50] we we we we it's it's it's like the like
[55:54] like if God's watering and watering and
[55:58] watering the garden and all it wants to
[56:01] do is produce thorns and
[56:03] thistles why would he take the time to
[56:06] dress the garden anymore he'll turn
[56:09] around and set it a
[56:11] fire amen and start start all over again
[56:15] repow it Whatever It Takes no reason no
[56:19] reason to work so hard on it and it's
[56:22] comes the same thing when God has spoken
[56:25] to us us of this Vindicated truth that
[56:29] God's given us in this day and age when
[56:32] he's he's he's he's he he he raises the
[56:36] Sun up brings the water in he the and
[56:40] and only the weeds want to
[56:42] grow and what he's trying to dress the
[56:45] herbs don't have don't want to don't
[56:48] want
[56:48] to produce they don't want to produce
[56:52] fruit worthy of repentance where's
[56:54] what's happening
[56:56] says you
[56:58] know you know when I was looking at the
[57:01] at
[57:05] the looking at what what what what it
[57:10] took what does it take for
[57:16] example something has to die so we can
[57:19] live right you know some of us say well
[57:22] I'm going to become a vegetarian I'm
[57:25] just I'm just not going to eat no more
[57:27] no more animals cuz I love animals so
[57:28] much I'm just not going to eat
[57:32] animals but that fruit has to die that
[57:36] that that that that herb has to die for
[57:39] you to live so you say well I'll become
[57:42] a vegan I won't eat any animal products
[57:44] I won't eat eat any any any milk I won't
[57:47] eat any any Meats I won't eat nothing
[57:49] like that still you have to eat
[57:52] something or you'll
[57:53] die so what what do we look looking at
[57:56] we're looking at in
[57:58] spiritually the Lord had to give his
[58:01] life amen to send down his holy spirit
[58:05] to come and anoint the bride of Christ
[58:08] for this day and hour to bring her to a
[58:10] place he's not doing it in vain he wants
[58:14] to bring your faith up to receive what
[58:17] he's promised for your day and
[58:19] hour for the bride has made herself
[58:22] ready what are we looking at the
[58:24] anointed ones we're anointed Ed for an
[58:27] hour and an hour's come upon us there's
[58:31] an hour that's come upon us that's to
[58:33] bring us to a revealed word for this
[58:36] hour to bring you to a rapturing faith
[58:40] to bring you to a place where you'll say
[58:41] look I I I can't just sit around and and
[58:45] and take everything the devil's trying
[58:46] to throw at me right right I'm going to
[58:49] take God's word and I'm going to believe
[58:51] God's word I'm going to take him at his
[58:54] word because he said it not me he said
[58:57] he gave me that promise I can believe
[59:00] that
[59:01] promise because I I've come to the place
[59:04] where I know who I am I know I'm the
[59:07] anointed one for this hour to receive
[59:11] his Holy Spirit and believe him and take
[59:13] him at his word amen well we we know
[59:17] that you know as jambers and jambers
[59:19] withstood Moses we know that that that
[59:22] that they they they they came against
[59:24] the true Vindicated ones for the
[59:26] power let's go over to Hebrews I got
[59:30] to Hebrews the 11th
[59:34] chapter and let's start at the first
[59:36] verse because I'm just going to touch at
[59:37] the first verse and then go to the last
[59:40] verse on Hebrews 11
[59:43] okay for faith is the substance of
[59:46] things hoped for the evidence of Things
[59:49] Not Seen for by by it the elders
[59:52] obtained a good report through faith we
[59:56] we understand that the worlds were
[59:59] formed by the word of God so that things
[1:00:04] which are seen were
[1:00:07] made of things which do not appear right
[1:00:11] Y what do you mean God made all these
[1:00:15] all that we know of everything that's in
[1:00:17] existence that man has been able to peer
[1:00:20] into space and see everything that's
[1:00:23] vastly out there
[1:00:26] you know they were showing the one of
[1:00:28] the satellites we work on satellite on
[1:00:31] on uh nuclear we work on nuclear
[1:00:34] fuels and in these nuclear fuels we have
[1:00:37] to put these little things heat sources
[1:00:39] and stuff on these satellites that are
[1:00:41] going to go way out of the
[1:00:44] atmosphere okay uh and you can look them
[1:00:46] up uh it's uh uh on those satellites
[1:00:50] that are going to take pictures of
[1:00:51] Saturn and so forth like that uh I think
[1:00:54] that was called uh I can't remember the
[1:00:56] name of the of Cassini the Cassini robot
[1:00:59] the Cassini uh uh the Cassini uh Mission
[1:01:04] we I I was there building uh putting
[1:01:07] together or sending off all these heat
[1:01:09] sources and we we actually compiled up
[1:01:12] and made generators out of nuclear fuel
[1:01:15] to go up there and it gets way away from
[1:01:17] the Sun so they can't use solar power to
[1:01:19] to power these satellites but they told
[1:01:22] it as it was dying out there in space it
[1:01:24] was getting way away past Pluto past the
[1:01:27] last last uh Stars they told it to turn
[1:01:31] its cameras and take its last picture of
[1:01:34] Earth and it turned around and it saw
[1:01:37] where Earth should be and took a picture
[1:01:40] of it and it was just a little speck in
[1:01:44] a huge beam of
[1:01:45] sunlight way out there in
[1:01:49] space and it just kind of makes you
[1:01:52] realize how small we really are exactly
[1:01:56] but then when you start looking at the
[1:01:58] vastness of everything there is this
[1:02:01] scripture here tells you it was all made
[1:02:03] of something that's not there he didn't
[1:02:07] start with anything it's not like you
[1:02:09] all sisters making a baking a cake where
[1:02:11] you have to start with flour and and add
[1:02:13] some re add some the different things to
[1:02:16] bake a cake and make it come out the way
[1:02:18] it did no he started with
[1:02:22] nothing it was all through faith he
[1:02:25] produced produced it all out there GL he
[1:02:28] produced everything there is amen all
[1:02:32] through
[1:02:33] faith and then it goes on if you read
[1:02:36] Hebrews it tells you that Abel offered
[1:02:38] unto God a more excellent sacrifice
[1:02:41] Enoch walked with God and went off with
[1:02:43] God Noah while he built the ark and he
[1:02:46] he did it through faith because God had
[1:02:48] revealed to him Abraham stood there and
[1:02:51] he took God's word and and received the
[1:02:54] promised son you look at Isaac
[1:02:56] that he he he he he lived with the
[1:02:59] Patriarchs and all that and and did the
[1:03:01] things he did all through a call of God
[1:03:04] you look at Moses how he brought the
[1:03:06] children out in The Exodus and all all
[1:03:08] through a call of God you look at at at
[1:03:11] at all of Israel uh and and and and of
[1:03:15] course you speak of Rahab and and all
[1:03:18] the the fathers of the faith and then we
[1:03:21] go to the end of the chapter Faith
[1:03:23] chapter and this is what I want to refer
[1:03:25] to yeah one little place in this
[1:03:27] scripture that really triggers me
[1:03:31] because we're looking at fathers of the
[1:03:33] faith whom the world was not worthy of
[1:03:36] and they and these having not and these
[1:03:40] having not
[1:03:42] obtained having obtained a good report
[1:03:45] through faith received not the promise
[1:03:50] for God having provided some better
[1:03:53] things for us God having provided some
[1:03:57] better things for us that they all these
[1:04:00] fathers of the faith brother brandom
[1:04:04] laying in the grave right now they amen
[1:04:07] without us yes sir should not be made
[1:04:11] perfect you got a calling here you got a
[1:04:16] purpose here you've got to come to a
[1:04:19] place you got you've got to stand on
[1:04:23] what God has revealed in this day and
[1:04:25] age to stand by faith and produce
[1:04:30] something produce
[1:04:32] something you know I was looking at the
[1:04:35] call of
[1:04:36] Moses his
[1:04:39] calling and and I was reading through it
[1:04:42] you know kind of like you know how you
[1:04:44] can take a scripture and let's go down
[1:04:46] into Exodus I want I'm getting way off
[1:04:49] my my subject but it it it it it kind of
[1:04:53] triggers me because it's interesting
[1:04:55] thing how let's go to
[1:04:58] Exodus and it's an interesting
[1:05:01] thing how Moses was getting
[1:05:06] Called Moses was standing before the
[1:05:08] burning bush and God was talking to
[1:05:16] him and it kind of triggers that hey
[1:05:20] just as God is calling Moses he's
[1:05:22] calling
[1:05:23] me so okay
[1:05:26] uh Moses the little uh subtitle that
[1:05:29] says Moses before the burning bush uh
[1:05:33] and it's in uh Exodus the 3rd
[1:05:41] Chapter okay in the uh the midst of the
[1:05:43] burning bush Okay okay this is the way
[1:05:46] God's talking to Moses on the sixth
[1:05:50] verse Exodus 3:6 moreover he said I now
[1:05:56] this is God speaking the word I a
[1:05:58] personal pronoun I am the god of your
[1:06:02] fathers okay and then he mentions who is
[1:06:05] uh of Abraham and Isaac and
[1:06:08] Jacob Moses hid his face from God and
[1:06:12] then and then the Lord continues saying
[1:06:14] I have I have surely seen the
[1:06:18] afflictions of my people I know then we
[1:06:21] drop down to the seventh verse middle of
[1:06:24] seventh verse I know their sorrows I am
[1:06:28] come down to deliver them this is the
[1:06:31] eighth verse
[1:06:34] uh the ninth verse he says I have also
[1:06:38] seen the oppression wherein the
[1:06:40] Egyptians oppressed them the 10th verse
[1:06:43] I will send and I will send thee okay so
[1:06:49] God saying I see the afflictions I've
[1:06:51] seen what they I remember my promises I
[1:06:54] do all these things but now now I'm
[1:06:56] sending you
[1:06:58] amen you know
[1:07:00] what it's the same
[1:07:03] thing God is sending you
[1:07:07] now the message has Glory been put down
[1:07:11] already it's on magnetic tapes Hebrews I
[1:07:15] mean excuse me uh uh uh the
[1:07:20] uh Revelations 10 said that in the day
[1:07:25] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[1:07:28] he shall begin with to sound the
[1:07:30] mysteries of God should be finished it's
[1:07:32] been put down on Magnetic Tape Brethren

[1:08:01] produce it has to produce it's no
[1:08:05] longer it's it's no longer I I remember
[1:08:09] these things I remember what I've done
[1:08:11] I've seen their oppression I've seen
[1:08:13] what they're doing but now I'm sending
[1:08:15] you right amen what's he sending you to
