just come and speak to our hearts and let us understand what you would have to be said unto us and lord in doing that then come down and heal the sick deliver of those lord that have problems and then lord come on the scene and save souls and bring everything into being we love you and we thank you father we committed to you now in jesus name amen maybe we'll get off these two scriptures one of these days psalms 118 verse 19 open to me the gates of righteousness i will go into them and i will praise the lord this gate of the lord into which the righteous shall enter remember jesus is that the way the truth the life the gate and all the thing i will praise thee for thou has heard me not become my salvation the stone which the builders refuse is become the headstone of the corner now we want to get onto that a little bit the headstone of the corner all right this is the lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes this is the day which the lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it save now beseech thee oh lord oh lord i beseech thee sin now prosperity they should be he that cometh in the name of the lord we have blessed you out of the house of the lord now turn over to zechariah now remember what we said there he said he's the one that the builders refuse is become the headstone of the corner now that's a little different than our thinking a lot of times so we'll have to get to that scripture in a few minutes all right zechariah 4 and the angel that talked with me me came again and waked me as a man that is waking out of his fleet and he said unto me what's his thou and i said i have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold with a bowl up on the top of it and his seven lamps there on and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by it one up on the right side of the bowl and the other up on the left side and i answered and spake to that to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and i said no my lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the lord now hang on to that see he's explaining what he's shown him the word of the lord which would be the bride of the old testament one set of candlesticks revelation says and the bride of the new testament because there's two sets in revelations 11 and 4 then he answered and speaking to me saying this is the word of the lord unto jerubal saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who art though great mountain before is removable thy shall become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shouting's crying grace grace unto it moreover the word of the lord coming to me saying the hands of aruba will have laid the foundation this house and his hands shall also finish it and i shall know that the lord of hosts has sent me unto you for whoever despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of jerubal with those seven which are the eyes of the lord which run to and fro through the whole earth now the seven eyes is what over in the book of revelation the seven eyes seven golden candlesticks all the same thing right right then answered i and said unto him what are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candles taken up on the left side there and i answered again and said unto him what be these two olive branches which brought the two golden pipes which through excuse me the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves and he answered and said answered me and said knowest thou not what these be and i said no my lord then said he these are the two anointed ones that stand below beside by the lord of the whole earth you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now to not back up a lot but to back up and review and i ask you that uh missed sunday to please listen to those services because in that i placed in there something that i was concerned about and been unconcerned about um for 20 30 years or more and that was that in zechariah it listed one candlestick two olive trees the book of revelations it says two candlesticks two olive trees and uh then we know that it's dealing with the end time because zerubbabel would represent the end time messenger that would bring the message in the end time and he would bring forth as we read there the headstone crying grace grace unto it now we'll get back to that in a minute but i want to back up and just just say a few words and and make sure you follow me see as i said in revelation in zechariah these two anointed ones they stand by the lord of the earth but over in the book of revelations it says revelation 11 4 i think three or four says they stand before me so there's a difference in it all right now then what bothered me was how could i get through there and and be able to hold it together to where that i could understand what was being meant in each position along the way you know and then to be able to come out with a finality of the book of revelations and and in doing that we tried to we spent quite a time speaking on these things and i told you that in matthew 17 then is the only place that you find moses and elijah standing by the lord jesus all right because there they were standing by the lord jesus in other words matthew 17 verse 3 they were talking with him brother branham i gave it to you where they had already entered into their theophany and they were able to talk to the lord jesus and tell him uh things and see people would get the idea well how could they tell him something well how could uh brother brown's little daughter that was 18 months old when she died be able to tell him one day that what was taking place is because that theophany situation which is the word all right so don't get tied up into that with questions about something just take it for what it is all right see then we looked at matthew 17 and that's looking at matthew 17 i gave you the pro quotes were and most everybody uses matthew 17 as to be where the message of adoption comes from of the hear ye him you know moses and elijah and the lord jesus and then to hear ye him see of that scripture so it's basically used by people as adoption and that is correct but it must be placed correctly then and that's what i was trying to do see because brother branham said matthew 17 was actually the second coming because matthew 16 he said that jesus says there'll be some standing here that won't see death until they see me coming into my kingdom all right and brother random said john was the one that went right up in chapter 17 to the minor transfiguration and actually saw moses and elijah and that's exactly the order of his second coming now people take that all over to israel now there's a second coming to the bride all right so who come to the end time bride to bring the message i thought we believed that malachi 4 was to turn the hearts of the children you know to the faith of the fathers and things like that and then turn us backwards and forth i thought we believed it was the end time message i think well i didn't start staying verse where zechariah saw exactly the two anointed ones all right the two anointed ones are representation of the two olive trees they're not olive trees they're two prophets but they're in representation of the two olive trees you know that's what it's represented as because that's where the oil comes from to be able to burn the candle right it was from the olive trees good to see sister jones back there with us she's not a visitor but she she gets recognized she's she's a senior citizen she gets recognized okay but now see then looking at it we see that's exactly what brother branham says it is and he uses it he says now i want to use it in another way but i want you to see this is the lineup of the scriptures that is actually the second coming and he said that was what they were doing was discussing in other words with jesus what was going to take place his crucifixion et cetera and all and his coming they were talking with him it says there in matthew 17 3. all right now then we look at it and we see that that's exactly the order of the second coming that was what i couldn't catch he said well now you just quoted all the quotes about it yeah you can quote all the quotes you want to but if it ain't revealed right you know you got a line up but if it's not revealed see then you're just as bad off as if you haven't even read other than the fact that you do have the letter in the field you have at least planted the seed but you understand what i'm saying the second the order of the second coming of jesus christ is what god would send us a lie to the prophet right before the coming of the dreadful day of the lord and the dreadful day of the lord is not the the rapture the dreadful day of the lord it's the tribulation and going on that way all right but he would he promised that he would send us a elijah during malachi 4. and the order of us the coming of the lord see then it ties together that elijah comes you know the fourth time because remember the spirit of elijah comes five times okay you got elijah elisha got a double portion right okay elisha go read your bible he said what would you have for me to get he said i want a double portion of your spirit he said okay in other words it's a rough thing but if you if you want that it's yours for you if you're there when it goes and remember elijah done four miracles elisha done eight all right so he got a double portion all right then john the baptist according to malachi 3 would be the third coming of elijah all right and he turned up the hearts of the children he would be the one that would be speaking of in malachi 4 but you take luke 1 17 and it shows you exactly that john the baptist was in the spirit and power of elish which is elijah but see that was the third time all right see in the end time we're promised according to malachi 4 that god would send us someone with the spirit of elijah not the person of elijah but the spirit of elijah to take over an individual and the spirit of elijah is the spirit of the lord jesus christ amen all right now but it's in the prophetic form all right so that would be the fourth in this day bringing the number of restoration back into view we'll see then in the tribulation it will be elijah and moses okay because that way that'll be the fifth coming of elijah making the five times making exactly what god promised would take place here in the end time but now if you understand what i'm getting at go if you want to read it in matthew 17 right after that that you're reading there of the hearing hymn and and they're saying to jesus but we thought the lies was to come watch him he said a lie shall come future tense and restore all things he said when i say unto you that notice is capitalized there that elijah that you're talking about has already come which would and they understood the scripture said if you're reading it there then he spoke of john the baptist so it specifically stated that's why when john they asked him said are you alive he said no because he would have been saying he was all five times manifested they said to brother rather you're elijah he said no john may ask him that he's no i'm the voice of one truck crying in the wilderness which was isaiah 40 about 42 in there to fulfill the scripture right but what i'm trying to get you to see is that there in the mount of transfiguration is standing moses and elijah exactly the order of the second coming because elijah has to come and restore the word to us all right then you can go over to the tribulation and pick up moses brother adam i gave you the quote daniel 70 weeks he sent the spirit of elijah off of the gentile church now i didn't make that quote you argue with brother branham right he said the spirit of elijah off the gentile church would go to israel now brother adam wanted to go to israel he was headed that way he got to cairo egypt and god stopped him yet he had already spoken that they would only receive a prophet you see he thought it that would work in some way things could get worked out but god said nope not the time yet said the iniquity of the amorites is not full all right so he came back to preaching to the gentiles because see those two prophets that go to israel brother random said would be two jews there won't be a gentile and a jew and be two jews now you say well elijah didn't have no uh lineage or anything of that of the order will evidently must have a pretty good one because god used it but anyhow you want to argue the point about it i'll just make the point when it ends up he won't use brother brown and said he'll use two jews to bring the message but now what i tried to get you to see was that the old and the new testament brother branham said was the two olive trees so now you just said it was the two prophets that's exactly right yeah i think both cases is right yeah because remember where does the where does the candlestick olive oil come from it comes from them two out trees which you've got a prophet for the old testament and a prophet for the new testament how much more would you want not that brother adam was a prophet in the old testament no the three times had taken place in the old testament he was a new testament prophet to catch the revelation of all things right you see then as it come down we can see that they are actually standing one beside the other and that is the order i gave you the quotes that brother brown said that's the order of his second coming all right now the order be dawning on you a little bit what i preached that the second coming of jesus christ the bright coming of christ coming out of the church started on the day of pentecost and that's been his coming it's not our coming right martin luther was not martin luther martin luther was god made manifest for the portion for what it was at the time right sure he used a man but god was the one to bring it that's why zechariah said it's not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the lord he said this is the word of the lord right then he goes over and asked him about the two candlesticks he said these are two the two anointed one what who brings the word prophets right well is it there amos three and six i believe it is where he said i'll do nothing but reveal it to this prophets so we have to have a prophet to come in the end time we don't make bread around nothing god made him what he is you don't hear me up here preaching every week to try to prove to you brother brown was a prophet if you don't been around here a while and don't believe that you're in bad shape you sure have done a lot of sleeping and i still got that pepper in there if anybody wants it to to stay awake with it tonight but now listen i want to try to get to a point but did you notice in psalms i read it over and over and over this makes about 17 times i guess the word said he's the headstone of the corner right well now i'd rather dale i don't understand that but i can draw it i can see the cornerstone and i can see the headstone i can tell you all about the cornerstone you know and i can tell you about the headstone and i'm thinking that it's the same stone but different positions are different doings but why did one did the song to star saved it he's the headstone of the corner right right he had a reason he didn't say it's a headstone and says this any other god can talk the way he wants to he said zerubbabel would bring forth the headstone and brother around and said see there jerubal didn't bring the cornerstone because it had already been laid he said he just like removable there just cleaned off and brought it back to restoration but now what the headstone i gave you a quote number one on your notes there to where that brother around said on standing in the gap i'll give you this many times but he said in the church it's the cornerstone in the full church it's the headstone right look at the things it's just underlying scene you'll see what i'm talking about all right now we know that ephesians 2 and 20 says that we're built upon the foundations of apostles and prophets jesus christ being the chief corner stone chief cornerstone then the early church had the cornerstone which is the revealed word right the early church had the cornerstone because we're building a foundation apostles and prophets all right but the psalmist says see whereas in the new testament it's speaking of the builders refusing it and it becoming the the head of the corner we'll get to it in a minute but the psalmist said the headstone of the corner now the art to me is where brother branham got that the cornerstone and the headstone is the same stone right now he's got it in the bottle right so of course the organization has taught it that way too because you know we could read but what did he have all right now watch get the point and then we'll get down to something i want to say in just a minute acts 4 11 says that he's become the head of the corner right the head of the corner psalmist says he's the head stone of the corner ephesians 5 and 23 sees even as christ is the head of the church now here's what we want to deal with for just a minute the cornerstone is christ you agree christ is the revealed word right the headstone is christ the revealed word so it would be the same stone truly but according to what is being made manifest but just remember now he's the head of the church today we had to wait until the end time get a headstone that's what i hear people people preach they want to talk something about something in the end time that wasn't down through there no he was the head of the church right yeah ephesians says that now he's not the headstone of the entire body because the entire body wasn't there when that was being spoken that's why i gave you the quote where brother man said in the church he's the cornerstone in the full church he's a hedge tongue because he become the headstone of the corner why because he's the head of the church right here's our head which is the reveal word we're supposed to be the body and what is he supposed to be come on brother gary dogs we get dogs and cats to get horses and no they don't do that well i'm glad you thought of it like that dogs would get dogs cats to get cats horses would get horses in other words if you don't get nothing that's out of the message to not remember the body and the head must be the same material right because i could have brought all these quotes but i'm trying to get away from doing so much of that now because if you don't understand what the prophet said you'll miss this one but he was talking about how that that if your head is flesh and your foot is concrete he said there's no way to get the message to the feet to make it move so the body of christ has always been no matter what age they were in was the word of god for that age you agree amen because that's your seven golden candlesticks right that's the spirit of seven spirits of god which ain't seven spiritual goddess took is god in seven manifestations now in doing that then he was the head of the church back there we've never been left without a head well i can't understand that because i thought the headstone would be the head that's in the full church you think he's not our head now who was lutheran wesley them magnitude you see one of the preachers in this message they'll come up and see there's something wrong and they'll just say ah them people didn't have nothing then people didn't have nothing back there it's alpha and omega and nothing in between well that's a quote yeah but then they don't quote the others where he said he's out from the mega and everything in between just remember the same oil that was burning in number one candlestick was burning in number two number three number four number five number six and number seven and it wasn't that it got weaker down that was a drawing that was made by the the the angel of the lord with the showing what had happened about the word but see if jesus christ then is our head then he is truly as i as the song is said he is then the headstone of the corner right the corner was one thing and they had another he's the head of the church the body and where do we get to that in a minute brother said he's the head of the church which is redeemed to bring the message in the last days right but you see listen to what i'm trying to say the word of god that was revealed in the book of acts of jesus christ he is and will always be the head of the church right the headstone didn't come to bring you another revelation of jesus christ different from the original it come to bring it to you to unfold or unveil it for our day i gave you the quotes on the message of grace where brother branham was talking about there on number two of your notes how that uh end time messenger would sweep off the foundation and he would bring forth the headstone but brother adam never taught anything different than what paul and him told he stood right there on what they taught and when he went beyond the curtain of time he said they said to him you'll have to be judged he said will the apostles have to be judged and they said yes he says then i don't have to worry because i preach just will they be accepted and he said they said yes he said well then i don't have to worry he said god only preached what they preached and we're coming down to the end time to see what their what it is and i believe and i've told you many many years ago that i believe the opening of those seven seals is the headstone to the church that's what i've always believed but it's the opening of the revealing of it not just because you read the book right that's right it's when it's revealed to you like it was or me like it was revealed to him then brother random come up and say what he said how many gods do they have back there he said just one he says how many gods have we got down here he said just one see but do you understand now where we can move on that he is the headstone of the church right even at the faith of the fathers he is that headstone right you said but now the headstone wouldn't all right that's what they rejected they rejected the headstone but he come to the bride as the cornerstone right to be the head of the church if you don't understand that please please ask me something about it now here's something that i'm trying to bring you to if you're reading number two down on your notes you're seeing the prophet talking about that the headstone will come crying grace grace now can the cornerstone be teaching legalism and the headstone grace is that what you think do you think brother random finally come to straighten out the scriptures and tell us the real scriptures he read between the lines he didn't come straight out of the scriptures i didn't they didn't need straightening out he stood on the scriptures and god vindicated he was standing on our scripture but you see then to understand it we must see one point as i say in there a moment ago can the body brother gary be one thing and the head be another now if the headstone and you're to be able to follow that easily if the headstone is revealed word then what would be the body of christ well i just want to speak see you got it different now that's right you're making it something different well in a way i guess you could say it like that you're making it something different the head body has to be the same material we'll read it in a minute if not what have you got foot of a bar head of a line what do you got the bride can't be one word or something different and he'll be the word right right and we claim to have the birth of the word now i want to get one point to you you don't have to turn there because we've been through it enough but if you want to turn you go ahead while we're talking i want to prove something in the scripture by the scripture in isaiah 61 the psalmist was writing the writer isaiah and he went through you know the spirit of the lord is upon me because he had anointed me to preach the gospel and et cetera coming through and he went on into bringing judgment when jesus came over in luke 7 4 4 and 18 he quoted a height of isaiah 61. he said the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel he stopped why because that was what was pertaining to him being there at that time now i want to ask you a simple question because this means more than you think is this end time people do they house the second height of isaiah 61 where it speaks of judgment do we have that or do we have the first height which speaks of grace now listen i got a little sense all right don't worry about it i know you turned down this message you got judgment but if you turn down the message of martin luther you was judged already if you turned down the the message of paul you was judged already it's not that you have to go to a white throne that's just the fact that he's going to show no partiality and take everybody there you see people say this is a judgment message oh we preach hard we preach judgment we preach women's dress and hair and clothes and oh everybody just hates us because we we preach that judgment well now a moment ago you was following me so see if you still do that the body and the head can't be any different material now i gave you some quotes from brother branham to show that that it can't be a different material if the head is the word the body is the word what kind of a message do we have in the end time well brother dale we got the second height which is judgment well why would your prophet spend so much time talking number three on your notes paragraph 46-56 of the message of grace and talk about how that the headstone would come crying grace grace now if the headstone according to zechariah comes crying grace grace then this message is not a judgment message the two witnesses carry a judgment message to israel sure i know where the quotes are this message rejected is judgment judgment is declared in the land because the prophet of god preached the message what their they crucified him and called an indictment against all the organized religions and us independence you better go read that message or hear it we're all under an indictment of whether or not we're going to follow the word now if the body is word and the head is work it won't have any trouble right but if the body is part word and the head is forward what do we got so we don't we know definitely that the head is not part word right right there's no need to dealing with a head being part word ignoramus is in the message you want to do everything but that's all right their day will be counted unto them but you see the body must be the same as the head right the body can't be one thing and hit another so if brother branham was right when he was saying that about the message of grace and he goes down to the next one which is paragraph 104 of adoption when he says my whole makeup is grace see the headstone will not come crying law law works doings zechariah even saw that under the time of works and doings he would not even say that because he knew that that would not be it was revealed to him that it would be grace grace now remember one thing in the bible if god ever says anything two times you better look at what he's talking about when he said verily verily i say unto you you better hang on to that and say why is he double stating himself because god don't use vain repetitions he's telling you that because the whole message is grace i gave it to you in jehovah jireh number five on your notes where the prophet of god said the coming of headstone crying grace grace are crying grace unto the lord this is not a message of judgment unless you turn it down amen jesus message was a message of grace because salvation was prevalent right or there right for them to receive as long as salvation is here it's not a judgment message that's why people don't realize what they're preaching see they're preaching judgment judgment judge this is judgment message what and not realizing they're already saying we're in the tribulation or somewhere they're already saying redemption is over this is a message of grace not disgrace now brother brown says and i gave it to you where he said now grace straightened out not disgrace listening to him today on the token message he said you know it's nothing about what you do he said because if you keep on doing you prove you're lost that's as blunt as anybody can be but see that's fast forwarded you know you don't read that you kind of edit that out and you only read what you want well brother dale that's just because you come up to the baptist because the baptist was the message of grace brother random told you that grace was the oldest doctrine do you want that quote grace is the oldest doctrine that ever was do you need that quote you know when he said grace started before the foundation of the world when jesus christ stood as a lamb slain grace is the oldest message in the bible but you turn it down and you're automatically judged but remember the tribulation is the wrath of god poured out that's why the bride does not go through the tribulation because the tribulation is a wrath of god poured out we are in a pre-tribulation look around the world as i told you the other day where i was reading about that chunk of ice that's floated off it's four times the big the size of manhattan up there which is probably bigger than a lot of states we got like rhode island or something up in there that chunk of eyes would be bigger and said when it gets out into the shipping line you're going to have some more titanics but you see look titanic's ain't gonna bring things on us that we need but if i was you i would pay close attention now this may be me it may have been what the lord showed me so that's up to you you decide to have that's right i'm now no problem but do you know that obama okay for them to put that mosque oh now he's backpedaling he's wanting to get out of what he said he says i've only defended the constitution but he doesn't open his mouth he said because we have the right of religious freedom in america oh my god now i'm just asking you a simple question because i don't believe that obama in the office is going to put the bride to rapture right i don't believe that adolf hitler would be there to do it you know raise him and put him back that's not it there's got to be a religious persecution right right all right wouldn't that be the start of it because if they tell them they can't have it right they're going to rebel and say why can't we have it right and then they're going to crack down on everybody and say you can't do this you can't do that you can't do this you can't do that it's going to give them a right to do those times i ain't saying the lord spoke to anybody i'm just saying there's one thing for sure who's in the white house ain't going to put us in rapture right the economy is not going to put us in the rapture might put us in a place of desperation right yeah but not interaction right there's got to be a religious persecution come from somewhere right it's already in writing now that you can't use a hate word right we were told here that as a pastor i could use the word of gay but as the congregations you can't use it now whether that was right or not i don't know and i don't really care right you say well they're listening okay they've been listening all these years they come in here book bugs years ago probably worries about it i want them to know i want the world to know right where i stand in jesus christ amen who's worried but the head can't be one material and the body being another one now watch what i'm saying because if the head was one material and the body the other it wouldn't do any good for the head to cry grace grace right you wouldn't do any good to cry grace grace if it was two different materials you're dealing with but you see our message has got to be grace that's what i want to get to but around him i gave it to you 117 sign of the of this time 63 11 13 that's number six on your notes he said the head and body they got to be the same material see now if the message of the headstone is grace what will the body be say is that simple enough if the headstone is grace grace what will the body be saying right well that means you just let them get by anything up there brother damn i'm not quite now i'll put this church against any church in this message as far as the people being lined up and we're not lined up but i don't see any of the lining up in all these churches that just keep hollering dress and hiring this and that the other and preaching i don't see any different come on well i'll just stay with where we're at because the word can be the head if we preach the word at least one thing about it it can be revealed amen but if it's not preached it can't be removed that's right where it comes so it's according what you're eating them now here's what i want to read to you because this is bringing the point that i want to bring look at number seven on your notes let's see what your prophet had to say i quoted it while ago let's read number six while you're turning getting it do it okay the sign of this times it's 63 11 13 and that's the same thing that constitutes the new birth water blood spirit the elements that came from his body is what makes his body see it come from his it come from his body is the materials that takes to to make his bright because adam had his bride taken from his body right rib take another side of adam okay christ has his bride taken from the body that was not that where it was at on calvary was not the bride removed from the body because when they pierced his side your prophet said the water and the blood run out he said that was releasing of the bride and when christ died there were three elements that came from his body water blood spirit justification through believing water sanctification through the blood and baptism of the holy spirit and this last great step that must come into the perfection that the holy spirit has to live in that church so perfectly it'll make the head and the body unite together right see see that's the body he is the head in the body right now remember what i said while i go the psalmist in psalms said that he's the headstone of the corner right the only difference between the headstone of the corner and the headstone to the body is what just more word right amen right but now look what your prophet went on to say number seven on your notes christ of mr god revealed 63 728 and the kingdom of god is within you said the bible jesus the kingdom we are not a denomination we belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is the word of god made spirit and life in our own life amen bringing to pass every promise in this day as it did in that day when the word and god was one amen and the word and god is one in his church today right making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message in the last day and be taken up from the dead in the resurrection to go back and to restore again as adam and eve in the beginning of garden of eden the threefold mystery of god now read what your prophet said the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message well brought it down brother branham already brought the message okay but he's the one that said this well he goofed up there well all right you'll talk to him about it and when you're saying he goofed up or he didn't mean to say that or whatever then you're saying the body in the head's not the same material okay go ahead play your little games but your prophet said that the head and body would unite in the end time to bring the message come on what do you mean i mean just one thing for sure brother branham brought the message we believe it come on without him bringing the message we wouldn't have a message that's right but when that message is in the bride come on preach and unite with her in the bride remember cornerstone in the church headstone in the full church remember right brother what are you expecting to happen i expect god to unite with this bride and that she'll have the life's message because what is it 340 church age book watch let's make sure we get it right now under her messenger she will be the final voice to the final age it was not as i've always tried to tell you joshua that brought down the walls of jericho that's right it was the word that he delivered to the people i believe and they became the word and went and turned and stood and looked at the wall and as they were looking at the wall then their voices what brought the wall down right when they said what joshua said that's right that's all i've ever preached at the lice trump the scripture says for the trumpet shall sign that's not two trumpets no more than there's a two body a body and a head it's a different material it's all the same right amen same material right headship in the body unites to bring the message all right now what was the message of the cornerstone the revealed word of god for the day that they were living you agree the revealed word of god for the day that we're living that's the cornerstone then what will be the headstone it would be the message and if the headstone is crying grace grace you mean the headstones crying grace but when it gets on us it's quick and quick crying grace is startling judgment now i don't understand that i'm sorry thank you i appreciate that i don't understand that that way i just can't see it see when the headstone unites for the body it's going to bring its own message come on now folks this ain't something new what year was it brother gary 82 or 83 which one would go back and listen to those seals and i preached back in 82 and 83 and you'll hear these same things being said that the head and body would unite to bring the message brother branham brought the message right but you know what he was he was just like it was there in the book of acts or at the ending up in the old testament matthew mark luke john one of the fours covers it mark for for certain that when he raised from the dead there was an angel there to tell them people that he is risen that's right right he's not here he's risen we've preached two thousand years off of a resin resurrected risen lord jesus christ well what would be the headstone message i preached it sunday afternoon that's why i want you to listen to those that didn't hear i want you to listen there but most of you know what i've already said on it but the headstone says he's here right he's not coming he's here tie it back to just a minute that's why it covers the two in mount of transfiguration which is adoption and your prophet preached it at adoption amen but he told you that the real order of the scripture was the second coming of jesus christ so we wouldn't tell any wrong what is the second coming of jesus christ in the bride coming of christ coming out of the church the head will unite with the body now hammy remembers this quote you will never see god any more visible among you and your prophet said he would become visible among us and raise a dead and go into rapture he'll never be no more visible than he is through the headstone uniting with the body of christ that's right that's when he becomes visceral right you say knowledge signs and wonders what let's see there's where it goes you think your great computer's running good i've never preached nothing but signs and wonders you're looking at signs and wonders right rebecca what happened to that kidney stone blessing when she went into the process of it being busted to annihilate it you know what they couldn't find it hallelujah you know what they sent her home because they couldn't find it right brother mark what happened the other day when he was driving down the road you said to me now and i'm going to state it like you said you said you was running between 75 and 80 which that means just 10 miles an hour old speed limit i'm just playing yeah all right but you know what happened tire run off the car and him going that fight whole tire not just a rim not the whole rim wheel now went sailing out on the guardrail and yet the car just coasted to a complete stop on the side road now you tell me god's not here too late folks that's the god i preached over when i first saw him i've always tried to preach him as the revealed word to you and i to get you to see the revealed word to get you to see christ living among us because i've always believed what that prophet said the head body would unite to bring the message what's the message of the end time right he is here amen what else you want to talk about oh this great thing here and one of these days that obama's going to be and he ain't the right president because god be warming in the white house so it'll be maybe palin or any place or not it'd be her or hillary clinton or something it's got to be this way it's gotta be that way i thought it had to be the revealed word amen i didn't know who's in the white house anything to do with the rapture and brother branham said that in the final hours hanging on calvary more of the old testament was fulfilled than all of the time of the old testament in the final hours of calvary do you know right now if a couple of bullets flew kind of in the way to some of these guys you know who would be president right hillary clinton because all you got to do is take out all the guys above and that last one's a president bless him when that happens four we'll be ready we'll be ready to be the same material the word made flesh from the tree right right that's what your prophet said on restoration of bribery number 11 on your nose amen statue of a perfect man you remember how you're talking about her page 38 he says it's got to blend in with the same material it's vulcanized too you can't eyes metal and rubber won't work it's got to be the same material if he was the word we've got to be the word well all i all i just i just want to be a christian and just just this you know just be a christian well my sister julie brought in there a while ago about oh balak you know what baelik was saying balaam you go down there and curse him because i want the lord capital no rt balaam called him the lord and yet he wanted to curse israel and he called god the lord i mean where are we at everybody that says lord lord is not going to make it it's only those who the word is revealed to amen right what is your head brother dale there's no one headed i want no more than one thing that's right and that's just keep on getting the revelation from that headstone right right that one that in the middle of the night sometimes will just wake you up and give you something just speak to you see we're looking at it as some kind of a great big something got to happen out there this got to come down that's got to come down and all these planes this way in that way you go to the fourth seal and cover armageddon and show me or brother branham spoke of one shot being fired under that foreseeable go ahead but he calls it forces is coming down together around jerusalem and you know what he called them protestants and catholics gathering around jerusalem where we at right now we're sitting gathered around jerusalem russia's on one side china on the other one we're on the other what about it folks the prophet said the bride and the headstone would unite and the message would come it's a message of grace disgrace grace grace grace god god grace grace god praise grace that is greater than all our sins singing to him grace grace grace god what is your makeup brother random his grace now there wasn't a man in the world that has preached as strong against sin as that man has preached right but yet he said my whole makeup is grace he said grace is not if i scratch your back you'll scratch mine he said grace is i'll scratch your back whether you scratch mine or not grace what about it this message is not judgment i hope you caught that it's grace because the headstone of cry grace grace unto it unto what he's coming down hollering grace grace because we're going up our grace grace grace in its correct order is the most wonderful thing that could ever be preached and the most hardest thing for a human body to try in the mind point of bringing it to hold it together because it looked like that you're running it off it looked like it you're running it off and saying it's okay to do this okay to do that no i've tried to explain to you salvation is a gift of god you do not do anything to get it you just receive it but once you receive it it brings all forms of rules and regulations with it you say well that ain't great sin you're not gonna die and go to hell because of some little something you do but if you don't want to get rid of that then if we don't want to get rid of those things then they will eat us alive and they will destroy us what we got brother 6 12 spiral you might have a name you see grace wouldn't that one dwight movie right out in the streets and sin do you know grace and the person said grace him he said the grace of god that covered all sin one of my friends when you thank martin luther saw when he said to josh shall live by faith my grace i want to use the grace of god you we condemn that under the blood of the lord jesus christ lay your hands upon our sister believe in you that my grace our sister is here because that's the grace of almighty heart we love you and we thank you in jesus name well let's see you might get something tell me what it is i thought it was supposed to be so simple until an illiterate person could understand it he said you can't see me if you want to see god read the word he is here joshua out there needed time he didn't stop to pray brother said he knew he'd pray through before the world you know what happened show me one person in the bible that never thought of god if not being personal believe it the psalmist would say they pierce my hands and my feet i could not pay i needed someone to wash my sins away and now i sing a brand new song amazing grace jesus my soul and set me free i'm glad that jesus did all of us history in jesus i think this is to see remember honor the church now don't be talking about i needed someone to wash my sins away
