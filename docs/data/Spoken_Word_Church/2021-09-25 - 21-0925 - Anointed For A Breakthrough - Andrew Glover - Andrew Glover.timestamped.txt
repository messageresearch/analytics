[38:15] is more of him a man not

[38:26] afternoon amen if you have your bibles
[38:28] while you're standing with us today
[38:30] we'll go
[38:30] straight to the word we want to look in
[38:32] the book of mark
[38:33] the fifth chapter
[38:35] given brother joseph our scriptures back
[38:37] there but i've just added this one here
[38:39] so you all
[38:41] forgive me this morning but in the book
[38:43] of mark the fifth chapter
[38:45] we want to look and we also want to look
[38:46] in the book of luke the 16th chapter
[38:49] and we want to say it sure is an honor
[38:51] and a privilege to be here with you all
[38:52] once again and we sure thank brother
[38:54] wade and the church here for the
[38:55] invitation to come and to minister to
[38:58] you today
[38:59] amen and we just want to look here in
[39:00] the book of mark the fifth chapter
[39:03] and i want to look in the 21st verse
[39:06] it's a very very familiar reading
[39:09] in mark the fifth chapter
[39:12] the 25th or the 21st verse
[39:14] the bible says when jesus was passed
[39:16] over again by ship
[39:18] and to the other side much people
[39:20] gathered unto him
[39:21] and he was unto the sea
[39:24] and behold there cometh one of the
[39:26] the synagogue jairus by name
[39:29] and when he saw him he fell at his feet
[39:32] and it sought him greatly saying my
[39:34] little daughter lieth at the point of
[39:36] death
[39:37] i pray thee come and lay thy hands on
[39:39] her that she may be healed and shall
[39:41] live
[39:42] and jesus went with him and much people
[39:44] followed him and thronged him now jesus
[39:47] is on his way somewhere and here is is
[39:50] interrupted by a lady it says in a
[39:52] certain woman which had an issue of
[39:54] blood for 12 years think about this for
[39:57] 12 years
[39:59] and had suffered many things of many
[40:00] physicians and it's been all that she
[40:02] had
[40:03] and was nothing bettered but rather grew
[40:06] worse
[40:07] and when she had heard of jesus now
[40:09] notice she heard of him
[40:11] she came in the press behind him
[40:13] and touched his garment
[40:15] for she said if i may touch but his
[40:17] clothes
[40:18] i shall be whole i i love this because
[40:20] no matter how long you've had the
[40:22] condition there's still a possibility
[40:24] for change
[40:25] and straightway the fountain of her
[40:27] blood was dried up and she felt in her
[40:29] body
[40:30] that she was healed of that plague and
[40:32] jesus immediately knowing in himself
[40:34] that virtue had gone out of him
[40:36] turned him about in the press and said
[40:38] who touched my clothes
[40:40] and his disciples said unto him thou
[40:42] seest the multitude thronging me and
[40:45] says who touched me and he looked around
[40:47] to see her and had done this thing
[40:50] but the woman fearing and trembled now
[40:52] let's just sit like this this was
[40:54] needless fear
[40:55] she didn't need this fear this woman
[40:58] fearing and trembling knowing what was
[41:00] done in her she came and fell down
[41:02] before him and told him all the truth
[41:04] and he said unto her daughter
[41:06] thy faith hath made thee whole
[41:08] go in peace
[41:10] and be whole of thy plague
[41:12] thy faith hath made thee whole
[41:14] go in peace and be whole of thy plague
[41:17] also in the book of luke the 16th
[41:19] chapter
[41:20] the book of luke the 16th chapter
[41:22] i want to read a verse there
[41:25] amen you love the lord this morning or
[41:27] this afternoon luke
[41:29] the 16th chapter
[41:31] and the 16th verse jesus here
[41:33] is speaking and he's just actually
[41:35] reproved the pharisees
[41:37] and in the 16th verse he says now
[41:40] the law and the prophets were until john
[41:43] and since that time the kingdom of god
[41:45] is preached
[41:47] and every man presseth
[41:49] into it let's read this verse together
[41:52] the law and the prophets were until john
[41:55] and since that time the kingdom of god
[41:58] is preached and every man presseth into
[42:01] it would you would you mind reading one
[42:03] more place with me hebrews 11. i know
[42:06] every bible believer here this morning
[42:08] could read this by heart but in hebrews
[42:11] 11
[42:12] i want to look at the first verse
[42:14] hebrews 11
[42:17] and verse 1. paul here speaking about
[42:18] the heroes of faith
[42:21] and the nature and the fruits of faith
[42:23] he says here in hebrews 11 and verse 1
[42:26] it says now faith is a substance of
[42:28] things hoped for it's the evidence of
[42:30] things not seen
[42:32] for by it the elders obtained a good
[42:35] report
[42:36] and through faith we understand
[42:38] that the worlds were framed by the word
[42:40] of god so that things which are seen
[42:43] were not made of things which do appear
[42:46] amen we ask the lord this
[42:50] as we just borrow our hearts together
[42:51] here this morning heavenly father lord
[42:54] as your believers have gathered here
[42:56] today
[42:57] lord as these young people stand before
[42:59] me this morning this congregation today
[43:01] lord
[43:02] lord i feel inadequate to stand here
[43:04] lord
[43:05] father i have no abilities of my own to
[43:07] offer no personality lord but i believe
[43:10] that this message that you've seen in
[43:12] this generation lord was not just sent
[43:14] to the elders or to the preachers or to
[43:16] the or the officers of the church but it
[43:18] was sent to the young people and lord i
[43:21] believe this morning if we can get
[43:22] ourselves out of the way that we can
[43:24] receive something of supernatural value
[43:26] from your word now father i invite you
[43:29] this morning to come take preeminence of
[43:31] both speaker and hearer and lord may you
[43:34] drive out every evil spirit oh god may
[43:36] you bind the hand of the enemy lord may
[43:39] liberty come into this building this
[43:40] this day lord father if there would be
[43:42] sickness among us lord may you heal them
[43:45] if there would be bondage lord may you
[43:47] set them free
[43:51] i pray oh god this morning you would
[43:52] drive it from the midst of the
[43:54] congregation lord may
[43:58] be sure to give you all the praise all
[44:00] the honor and all the glory for it's in
[44:02] the wonderful name of our lord and

[44:20] help with the lord uh here from these
[44:22] scriptures this morning amen for just a
[44:24] few moments i would like to speak to you
[44:26] if i would title this thought today i
[44:28] want to talk to you for a few moments on
[44:30] anointed for a breakthrough
[44:32] anointed for a breakthrough i believe
[44:35] amen this morning that we are not
[44:37] gathered here just as church members i
[44:40] don't believe we're gathered here just
[44:41] as people fulfilling religious duties or
[44:44] doing things uh maybe of a religious
[44:46] nature amen but i believe we're here
[44:48] today as believers and i believe that
[44:50] god has called us he has ordained us
[44:53] amen he has chosen us he has elected us
[44:56] amen he's actually called us from before
[44:58] the foundation of the world amen to the
[45:00] places that we are today amen as i began
[45:03] to look at this here in mark the fifth
[45:05] chapter amen you know the story very
[45:07] well of the woman with the issue of
[45:09] blood and you know that how that she had
[45:11] suffered these things for the bible says
[45:13] for 12 years she had been plagued and
[45:15] she had been to doctors she had been to
[45:17] physicians she had been all over the
[45:19] place and been trying to receive help
[45:22] but she was nothing better amen but she
[45:24] only grew worse and we find that at some
[45:27] point in her life or at some time amen
[45:29] amen she heard of a man named jesus she
[45:32] heard amen that there was a healer there
[45:34] was a deliverer amen and the bible
[45:36] actually says that she heard of jesus
[45:38] and when she heard of him it put her
[45:40] into action and the bible says that she
[45:42] came in the press behind and she touched
[45:45] the hem of his garment now we could all
[45:47] say it this way she was perseverant
[45:50] right amen she was perseverant now you
[45:52] know the prophet of god is going to
[45:54] preach a message called amen
[45:56] perseverance right he says now this
[45:58] morning we want to talk on faith he says
[46:00] now my subject this morning is
[46:02] perseverance he said for perseverance
[46:05] means to be persistent amen to make a
[46:08] goal so it's not just to be casual amen
[46:11] it's not just to be drifting or floating
[46:13] or wondering amen but it's to have a
[46:15] target right it's to have a vision is to
[46:17] have something that you're aiming for
[46:19] and another place he said man that's
[46:21] ever amounted to anything
[46:23] at any time through any age has been men
[46:27] who believed in god they had faith in
[46:29] god and they stood against the enemy on
[46:32] every side and was perseverant because
[46:35] they believed in god think about that he
[46:37] meant a man that is ever amounted to
[46:39] anything he meant at any time through
[46:42] any age has been men who believed in god
[46:45] and had faith in god amen and stood
[46:48] against the enemy on every side he meant
[46:50] and was perseverant because they
[46:52] believed in god he said now i believe
[46:55] every christian amen should be very
[46:58] perseverant think about that amen i
[47:00] believe every christian should be very
[47:03] perseverant amen he's not saying to be
[47:05] casual he's not saying to be lukewarm
[47:08] he's not saying to be just a church
[47:09] member but he's saying have a drive
[47:11] about you amen amen have something
[47:13] pushing you have something motivating
[47:15] you amen i believe every christian
[47:18] should be very perseverant amen amen
[47:20] brother i don't know what's happened in
[47:21] my ear but it's changed since the song
[47:23] service if you could put it back the way
[47:24] it was that'd be great amen in luke the
[47:26] 16th chapter amen in the 16th verse
[47:29] jesus here is actually speaking he's not
[47:31] speaking about being casual he's
[47:33] speaking about being persevered he said
[47:36] the law and the prophets were until john
[47:38] and since that time the kingdom of god
[47:40] is preached now somebody say preached
[47:43] amen the kingdom of god is preached and
[47:46] every man presseth into it look at what
[47:48] this word presseth means it means to
[47:50] suffer violence it means to use force it
[47:53] means to apply force it means to inflict
[47:56] violence upon now here he's saying amen
[47:58] if you're going to come in the kingdom
[48:00] of god he meant at some point or another
[48:02] you're going to have to use some
[48:03] violence amen you're going to have to
[48:05] use some force you're going to have to
[48:06] push your way amen and look at matthew
[48:08] 11 12 he says from the days of john the
[48:11] baptist until now somebody say until now
[48:14] amen until now the kingdom of heaven
[48:17] suffereth violence amen but the violent
[48:20] take it by force isn't that amazing amen
[48:22] that the lord jesus is speaking about
[48:24] the kingdom he's speaking about people
[48:26] possessing the kingdom at the same time
[48:29] he's speaking about people becoming
[48:30] violent telling them now who are we
[48:32] becoming violent against are we becoming
[48:34] violent against our brother violent
[48:36] against our sister the prophet said i'm
[48:38] not trying to be rough but you cannot
[48:40] baby devil see amen you've got to let
[48:43] them know who is boss he said and we are
[48:46] boss now amen amen because jesus is here
[48:49] amen our big brother our big brother of
[48:51] redemption is here amen so the prophet
[48:54] is saying you're going to have to apply
[48:55] some force amen against the devil you're
[48:58] going to have to use some violence
[49:00] against the devil amen you can't just
[49:02] get casual and lay down and say well
[49:04] amen if i'm to receive the holy ghost
[49:06] then maybe some preacher will come
[49:07] through sometime amen and i'll hear the
[49:09] right quotes or read the right scripture
[49:11] amen but you've got to get desperate
[49:13] amen amen you've got to get
[49:15] and think about this amen the prophet
[49:17] preaches the message the token and
[49:19] follows it that night with a sermon
[49:21] called desperation he said seek
[49:23] desperation when thou seekest me amen
[49:25] with all thy heart then i'll hear you he
[49:28] meant he said amen see the law and the
[49:30] prophets were until john amen and since
[49:33] the kingdom of heaven's been preached
[49:35] and man press into it amen you don't
[49:38] just stand around and say pick me up by
[49:40] the collar lord and push me in but you
[49:42] press into it he said you get desperate
[49:45] it's between life and death amen amen if
[49:48] you want the holy ghost get desperate
[49:49] amen if you want deliverance hey men get
[49:52] desperate now amen if it's okay i'm just
[49:54] going to preach it for a minute amen
[49:55] because i think we're getting a little
[49:57] too casual he meant about serving god i
[49:59] think we're getting a little too casual
[50:01] amen about this message i think if
[50:03] there's ever been a time amen for a
[50:05] group of young people to raise up he
[50:07] meant under the anointing and the
[50:08] authority that this message has been
[50:10] delivered in i think it's now amen amen
[50:13] if there's ever been a young woman amen
[50:15] to really get persevered about the
[50:17] things of god i believe you are the
[50:19] young ladies amen if there's ever been
[50:21] young men that get on fire ignore the
[50:23] fire the holy ghost of this message you
[50:25] are the young men to do it you say well
[50:27] brother andrew there's an age coming
[50:29] there is no more ages coming amen we are
[50:31] in the final age we've got the final
[50:33] message amen we're living in the final
[50:35] hours amen if there's ever been a time
[50:37] to do something for god now's the time
[50:39] to do it amen now's the time to get
[50:42] desperate brother said see it's between
[50:44] life and death
[50:47] it's between life and death now think
[50:49] about this amen then where is that
[50:51] desire coming from in your heart he said
[50:53] when you seek me with all thy heart amen
[50:56] then i'll hear you amen the prophet said
[50:58] see that is not an unrighteous desire
[51:01] that is a righteous desire amen how many
[51:03] come here today to this service with a
[51:05] desire in your heart amen you one of you
[51:08] came amen two of you three of you amen
[51:11] how many came here today with a desire
[51:13] in your heart maybe maybe a healing or
[51:15] maybe maybe a deliverance or maybe an
[51:17] answer from the lord amen do you realize
[51:19] that that devil that you're fighting did
[51:21] not put that desire in your heart amen
[51:24] if you've got a desire to receive
[51:25] something from god amen that did not
[51:28] come from the devil amen it did not come
[51:30] from hell amen but that desire came from
[51:33] almighty god amen the prophet said see
[51:35] when i say this amen i want to be dead
[51:37] earnest with you he said when we when we
[51:39] when he speaks to me i can just say what
[51:42] he showed me he said whether it's good
[51:44] or bad i have to say it and sometimes
[51:47] it's not pleasant to tell people these
[51:49] things he said but yet i'm just just
[51:51] duty-bound amen to tell people the evil
[51:54] things that will befall them as i am
[51:56] duty-bound to tell them the good things
[51:58] that will befall them amen do you
[52:00] realize that when a prophet stood before
[52:02] the congregation he was not in control
[52:05] of his own voice he was not in control
[52:07] of his thoughts amen he was surrendered
[52:09] to a higher power than what he was
[52:11] saying was not coming from his office or
[52:14] coming from his church or coming from
[52:16] some school what he was saying was
[52:17] coming from god himself amen and the
[52:20] faker prophet would stand there amen now
[52:22] how many believes that brother branham
[52:23] was a prophet amen let's let's drive
[52:26] that devil out of the building for a
[52:27] minute we believe that william branham
[52:29] was a vindicated prophet of this age he
[52:32] meant with the message of malachi 4 that
[52:34] would turn our hearts back to the faith
[52:36] of the fathers we we believe that right
[52:38] amen then let's say it this way he was a
[52:41] vindicated prophet now amen you realize
[52:43] that when a prophet stands amen before a
[52:46] congregation he's looking at them but
[52:48] he's also seen in another realm like
[52:50] like i could be looking at you amen but
[52:53] a prophet would be looking at you but he
[52:54] would be looking at something in another
[52:56] realm that's why he would say i see you
[52:58] with a heart trouble or i see you with
[53:00] the nervousness so i see you with some
[53:02] you were bit by a dog as a child and
[53:04] that thing has followed you all amen he
[53:06] was looking in another dimension amen
[53:08] then he would come back and say hey man
[53:10] i see a black streak and it's going from
[53:12] one to another while it's a cancer he
[53:14] said see i see it there and you're free
[53:16] of that cancer and people would rejoice
[53:19] because they were healed he would say
[53:21] now that devil's exposed there and
[53:22] you're healed that see he was seeing
[53:24] things in another dimension and he was
[53:26] coming back down to the church and he
[53:28] was telling them what he was seeing in
[53:31] another dimension amen how many believes
[53:33] that a prophet sees the negative in
[53:35] another dimension we believe that amen
[53:37] then if we can believe he sees the
[53:38] negative in another dimension then this
[53:41] morning i want to talk to you about what
[53:43] he saw in the positive
[53:45] is that okay in a message show us the
[53:48] father it'll suffice paragraph 13 amen
[53:51] it's right before he reads the scripture
[53:52] and if you're not really even paying
[53:54] attention you'll read right over it he
[53:56] said now don't doubt just have faith to
[53:58] believe he said and i believe god's
[54:01] going to give us a breakthrough tonight
[54:04] i believe it's on the audience and then
[54:07] think about that i believe that god is
[54:09] going to give us a breakthrough tonight
[54:12] i believe it's on the audience amen then
[54:15] just as he could see depression he meant
[54:18] an anxiety and all kinds of demon
[54:20] spirits upon the audience i believe a
[54:22] prophet could see a breakthrough upon
[54:24] the audience and he said i believe it's
[54:26] going to happen tonight amen now how was
[54:28] the prophet speaking the prophet was
[54:30] speaking by the word of faith amen he
[54:33] was speaking by the word of faith in the
[54:36] book of romans the 10th chapter and the
[54:38] eighth verse the bible says it like this
[54:40] but what saith it amen the word is nigh
[54:43] thee it is even in thy mouth in the
[54:46] heart he said that is the word of faith
[54:49] which we preach amen that is the word of
[54:52] faith which we preach amen look what
[54:54] that word preach means it means to
[54:56] publish it means to proclaim openly
[54:59] something which has been done think
[55:02] about that it means to stand before a
[55:05] congregation to stand before a group of
[55:07] people and to boldly amen and strongly
[55:10] proclaim amen something has been done
[55:13] with the intent that if it's been done
[55:16] before it'll be done again oh god what
[55:19] are you saying preacher i'm saying amen
[55:22] that the word has delivered a young
[55:23] person before and i stand here this
[55:26] morning to say if the word did it before
[55:29] the word will do it again amen the word
[55:32] has healed the young people before if
[55:34] the word did it before the word will do
[55:36] it again amen the word of god has never
[55:39] failed in the mouths of believing
[55:41] christians amen now let me just go and
[55:43] let you a little secret okay amen i'm
[55:45] going to preach amen and if i've got to
[55:47] do the preaching and the amen it'll take
[55:49] twice as long to get out of here okay
[55:51] amen so if you want to get out of here
[55:53] quicker help me amen amen somebody is
[55:56] going to believe what they're hearing
[55:57] preached amen somebody is going to
[55:59] receive amen the word of faith amen i
[56:03] find it amazing that jesus himself stood
[56:06] and he said i must preach think about
[56:07] this i must preach the kingdom of god
[56:11] amen to other cities for therefore am i
[56:13] seen the prophet said i must preach the
[56:15] truth regardless of how it hurts
[56:19] i must preach the truth regardless of
[56:22] how it hurts amen or what it hurts he's
[56:26] telling you we must preach the word amen
[56:29] somebody say preach the word
[56:32] we must preach the word i think it's
[56:34] amazing when paul was writing to timothy
[56:36] there he says it like this preach the
[56:38] word amen be instant in season and out
[56:40] of season you reprove you rebuke exhort
[56:44] with all longsuffering and doctrine for
[56:46] the time will come when they will not
[56:49] endure sound doctrine amen the prophet
[56:51] said i want my friends both here and out
[56:53] in the lands where these tapes will go
[56:55] the reason i have took the stand i have
[56:57] for the word is this very reason preach
[57:01] the word amen that's the reason i would
[57:03] not talia with any of these creeds
[57:06] any of these denominations because i've
[57:08] been commissioned of god to stay with
[57:11] the word
[57:12] now if anybody else wants to do anything
[57:14] else that's up to them but he's saying
[57:17] my commission is stay with the word amen
[57:20] preach the word amen what are you saying
[57:22] i'm saying liberty comes by the word
[57:25] amen anybody want deliverance today
[57:27] it'll come by the word anybody want
[57:29] freedom today it'll come by the word
[57:32] anybody want
[57:33] victory today it'll come by the word
[57:35] that's why the prophet said we must stay
[57:38] with the word amen the prophet said see
[57:41] a few years ago in the holy ghost before
[57:43] it came he said the church began to get
[57:45] formal back in the days of methodist he
[57:47] said and you people cried to god amen
[57:49] for deliverance and god sent down the
[57:52] baptism of the spirit now since then
[57:55] people has been liberated amen from
[57:58] their sins by receiving the baptism of
[58:00] the holy ghost is that right he said now
[58:03] those who do not believe in it amen they
[58:06] cannot receive it amen you've got to
[58:08] believe in it therefore listen to this
[58:11] therefore he sent anointed preachers to
[58:14] preach the word and you received it
[58:18] amen he sent anointed preachers he meant
[58:21] to preach the word and you received it
[58:24] amen then god sent his word amen by
[58:27] anointed preachers amen the prophet will
[58:29] take time to show you how amen that when
[58:32] a person is preparing their chickens
[58:34] amen for the brooding house seem anybody
[58:36] here got chickens
[58:37] if you've got chickens you know what a
[58:38] prophet is talking about he said they're
[58:40] preparing them for that brooding house

[58:44] regulation of the heat in order for them
[58:47] to hatch he said see now in it don't you

[58:54] relate to amen he talks about putting
[58:56] chickens in a brewing house and placing
[58:58] them just right so the eggs will hatch

[59:05] he has sent anointed preachers he
[59:06] anoints preachers amen they're sent out
[59:09] to bring the word to put the eggs in the
[59:11] right position he said then he sent this
[59:14] same word and anchors it out there and
[59:16] then comes over and hovers it by the
[59:18] holy ghost he says until that word
[59:21] becomes life amen until that word

[59:27] the devils in hell amen could not keep
[59:30] it out of there amen no sir whatever the

[1:07:58] word it brought down the blood veil he

[1:08:21] aside when you see the blood amen when
[1:08:24] you see the blood come down amen is
[1:08:26] there anybody here this morning want to
[1:08:28] go to a place where there is no devil
[1:08:32] anybody want to go to a place where

[1:08:53] tell you what the prophet said he said
[1:08:55] while the word is being preached a blood
[1:08:57] veil is coming down he said and by faith
[1:09:00] you go through that blood veil he said
[1:09:02] and you're behind the blood and the
[1:09:04] devil amen can't even get to you because
[1:09:07] you're behind the blood and if he did
[1:09:09] get to you he'd have to come to the
[1:09:11] blood himself
[1:09:14] come on young people there's a place we

[1:09:54] of god made manifest when you hear that
[1:09:58] god done it for somebody else it
[1:10:00] increases your faith to believe if he
[1:10:03] did it for somebody else he can do it

[1:10:23] tense his word made manifest he's hid
[1:10:26] himself in human veil in his church
[1:10:29] revealing himself by your faith he meant
[1:10:31] in my faith coming together making the
[1:10:34] unit of god he said i can do nothing
[1:10:36] without you you can do nothing without
[1:10:39] me neither could do neither could do
[1:10:41] anything without god amen so together it

[1:14:16] i have given myself amen to study what a
[1:14:19] prophet said and if i'm going to feel a
[1:14:21] pulpit i'm going to say what a prophet
[1:14:23] said therefore there's no question on
[1:14:25] whether we can believe it or not if a
[1:14:27] prophet said it amen somebody's going to
[1:14:30] preach it and somebody's going to
[1:14:32] believe it
[1:14:34] see amen were they writing an example
[1:14:36] how many knows there was a girl in the
[1:14:37] bible named hannah
[1:14:39] the bible says
[1:14:40] you know there's a girl there named
[1:14:41] hannah
[1:14:42] right hannah was a barren woman she had
[1:14:44] never had a child the bible says she was
[1:14:47] bearing a reproach for being a barren
[1:14:50] woman the prophet of god said one day
[1:14:52] she got in her house and she got to read
[1:14:54] the scrolls
[1:14:55] and she received a revelation from god
[1:14:58] you're going to have a baby now brother
[1:15:00] wade here's what's amazing to me but let
[1:15:02] me say when hannah received that
[1:15:03] revelation you're going to have a baby
[1:15:06] he said she automatically went to church
[1:15:12] she automatically went to church
[1:15:15] so whatever revelation hannah got didn't
[1:15:18] keep her out of church it brought her to
[1:15:21] church
[1:15:23] whatever revelation she received didn't
[1:15:26] keep her away from the church it didn't
[1:15:28] elevate her above the church her
[1:15:30] revelation actually brought her to the
[1:15:32] church the prophet said she come in the
[1:15:34] church now watch this he said she
[1:15:36] interrupted the service
[1:15:38] he said she come in and she was
[1:15:40] screaming she was shouting she was
[1:15:43] rejoicing and she ran down to the altar
[1:15:45] and he says the minister eli the priest
[1:15:48] amen came out of the study and he walked
[1:15:50] up to her and he said how long will you
[1:15:52] be drunk on strong drink she said i'm
[1:15:54] not drunk she said god met me this
[1:15:57] morning and said hannah you're going to
[1:15:59] receive a child and you're going to give
[1:16:00] birth to a child and i'm going to remove
[1:16:03] the reproach over your life that you've
[1:16:05] been carrying all these years and she
[1:16:07] said eli all i know is something clicked
[1:16:10] on the inside of my soul i pushed
[1:16:12] through criticism i pushed through
[1:16:13] unbelievers to get here amen and the
[1:16:15] prophet of god said eli looked at her
[1:16:17] you know what eli was he was the
[1:16:19] preacher he was the anointed preacher he
[1:16:22] looked at her and said that's thus saith
[1:16:24] the lord he said she went on and
[1:16:26] announced with god's blessings
[1:16:28] now and i preached to you for a second
[1:16:31] she had to go through the hall of
[1:16:32] critics to get there
[1:16:35] she had to walk through the hall of
[1:16:37] critics she had to walk amen through
[1:16:39] people saying there's that barren woman
[1:16:41] there's that barren child that barred
[1:16:43] woman never had a child amen but she
[1:16:45] kept on going and she kept on pressing
[1:16:48] amen now let me show you something amen

[1:16:57] went to church brother zach amen with
[1:16:59] that kind of faith should god not have
[1:17:01] come down and give her a child right
[1:17:03] there and she come out of the building
[1:17:05] carrying the child but the prophet said
[1:17:07] that god made her wait nine months
[1:17:10] he made her wait nine months that that
[1:17:13] child could come to full maturity listen
[1:17:15] friends as a sign to show you amen are

[1:18:07] the word of god and she received the
[1:18:10] word of faith in her womb that

[1:21:06] believe the word it's the word of faith
[1:21:09] see the prophet said what time is this
[1:21:11] this is adoption time when the bible
[1:21:14] would say that as many as are led by the
[1:21:17] spirit of god they are what
[1:21:20] they are the sons of god
[1:21:22] he says for ye have not received the
[1:21:25] spirit of bondage somebody say the
[1:21:26] spirit of bondage
[1:21:28] the spirit of bondage again to fear but
[1:21:31] ye have received the spirit of adoption
[1:21:35] somebody say the spirit of adoption
[1:21:37] the spirit of adoption amen whereby we
[1:21:41] cry amen in that amazing we don't nod
[1:21:44] and we don't give a thumbs up amen amen
[1:21:46] but we actually cry we actually get
[1:21:48] vocal we actually open our mouth amen we
[1:21:50] cry how about our father amen do you
[1:21:52] realize what's happening there is a
[1:21:54] pentecostal age amen and the prophet
[1:21:56] said it this way he said by sensations
[1:21:59] and emotions is where pentecost missed
[1:22:01] it they went by who was speaking in
[1:22:03] tongues now now hey man you should be
[1:22:05] there this is the youth service i know
[1:22:06] but i'm preaching some stability if
[1:22:08] that's okay amen we don't go by feelings
[1:22:10] we don't go by sensations that's where
[1:22:13] pentecost missed it amen one day if they
[1:22:15] were shouting they were saved and the
[1:22:16] next day if they were in the mulley
[1:22:18] grubs they were lost amen but this
[1:22:20] message has brought us to an adoption
[1:22:22] faith which is without the spirit of
[1:22:24] bondage again to fear amen let me let me
[1:22:27] you oh god
[1:22:29] can i preach for a minute amen people
[1:22:31] tell me all the time they say well this

[1:22:36] scriptures i said well how come you
[1:22:38] can't read

[1:22:53] get away from this fear and scare you
[1:22:55] don't know who you are you're not going
[1:22:58] to be but now you are the sons of god

[1:25:44] oh glory to god listen friends we have
[1:25:47] got a message we have got books we have
[1:25:50] got tapes amen but may i say thank god
[1:25:52] for sending holy ghost-filled preachers
[1:25:54] who will stand behind the pulpits and
[1:25:57] will refer to what a prophet said to
[1:26:00] confirm the word of faith in our heart
[1:26:02] that when we see the holy ghost moving
[1:26:04] we can say the waters are troubled it's
[1:26:07] time to step in when we see the shaking
[1:26:10] in the mulberry bush and the angels
[1:26:12] flowing out of the benches of heaven we
[1:26:14] know it's time to go to war
[1:26:17] glory god has sent a spirit with
[1:26:20] anointed preachers with an anointed word
[1:26:22] to lead us and guide us into all truth
[1:26:26] now the prophet said this can i have a
[1:26:27] few more minutes
[1:26:29] the prophet said see he said the power
[1:26:31] that will raise us up is right in us now
[1:26:37] if you've got a shadow
[1:26:39] of the power of god in you you've got
[1:26:42] power to speak a world into existence
[1:26:47] and go live a private life on it
[1:26:51] if you can what believe it
[1:26:54] then whatever god somebody say whatever
[1:26:57] god
[1:26:58] will lead
[1:27:00] your soul
[1:27:01] to believe
[1:27:03] that is yours
[1:27:05] whatever god will lead your soul to
[1:27:08] believe that is yours what did zachariah
[1:27:11] say he said not by might
[1:27:14] nor by power
[1:27:15] but by my spirit saith the lord then
[1:27:18] what happens the word remember it's in
[1:27:21] it's in wisdom versus faith he said the
[1:27:23] word was already sown in the disciples
[1:27:27] the word was already sown him he said
[1:27:29] then what happened he said he sent his
[1:27:31] spirit he meant to energize the word he
[1:27:35] said the water of the word of faith
[1:27:37] energizes the word of god and makes it
[1:27:40] work see then there is an energy coming
[1:27:42] in the church amen it's not energizer
[1:27:44] bunny amen it's not it's not five hour
[1:27:47] energy it's not red bull it's not
[1:27:49] monsters amen it's a holy ghost energy
[1:27:52] it's a holy ghost energy flowing in the
[1:27:54] church energizing your heart energizing
[1:27:57] your soul come on church energizing you
[1:28:00] to raise your hands energizing you to
[1:28:02] sing energizing you to clap you all know
[1:28:05] as well as i know there's times you've
[1:28:06] come in here you didn't even feel like
[1:28:08] being here but before you left you left
[1:28:11] with a blessing you know why because
[1:28:13] there was an energy of the holy ghost
[1:28:15] amen flowing through the church that was
[1:28:17] energizing your innermost being to
[1:28:20] believe god is still god and his word is
[1:28:22] still true and his power is still here
[1:28:25] are you hearing me amen and when that
[1:28:27] energy comes in the church problem says
[1:28:29] when you really realize that god has
[1:28:32] revealed to you the truth of the thing
[1:28:34] there's nothing in the world going to
[1:28:36] defeat you in it you're absolutely
[1:28:38] somebody say you're absolutely
[1:28:41] say i am absolutely
[1:28:43] brother says you're absolutely
[1:28:45] undefeatable
[1:28:48] not you
[1:28:49] but god that's in you amen see not
[1:28:52] christ not the body he said but this the
[1:28:55] word that was in him not mary but the
[1:28:58] word that was born from her then the
[1:29:01] prophet said you become the word as you
[1:29:04] receive the word when you really realize

[1:31:42] that's been sown in you and there's a
[1:31:44] spirit here amen to energize the word
[1:31:48] that was sown in you
[1:31:50] oh glory to god i may be persecuted so
[1:31:53] was mary but you know what my prophet
[1:31:55] said he said when jesus christ when was
[1:31:58] christ jesus he was being formed and
[1:32:00] married that's when the persecution set
[1:32:02] in
[1:32:04] come on
[1:32:05] when that woman was getting the closest
[1:32:07] to the hell of his garment that's when
[1:32:08] the persecution set in and when christ
[1:32:11] jesus was being formed in the womb of
[1:32:14] mary he said that's when the persecution
[1:32:16] set in but can i tell you what amen i'm
[1:32:19] gonna i'm gonna take the breaks off and
[1:32:20] preach here for a second amen if that's
[1:32:22] okay amen mary broke through
[1:32:25] he meant she was anointed to break
[1:32:26] through you know why because she was
[1:32:28] carrying
[1:32:30] mary was carrying the breakthrough
[1:32:33] hello
[1:32:34] mary was carrying the breakthrough what
[1:32:37] is the breakthrough the breakthrough is
[1:32:39] the word
[1:32:40] the breakthrough's not a shout the
[1:32:42] breakthrough is not a dance we do those
[1:32:44] things when we do break through amen but
[1:32:46] the breakthrough is the word which
[1:32:48] scatters the devil that a son of god
[1:32:51] amen can believe the word concerning
[1:32:53] them
[1:32:55] glory to god
[1:32:57] are you hearing me church
[1:33:00] we are going to break through
[1:33:02] we are anointed to break through what
[1:33:04] are we we are believers
[1:33:06] we are believers we believe the word of
[1:33:09] promise then what does the word of faith
[1:33:11] and the word of promise say vermont says
[1:33:12] now listen to this he says now care all
[1:33:15] this message how many cares for all the
[1:33:17] message
[1:33:19] you want it all
[1:33:20] 47 to 65.
[1:33:23] three pulls
[1:33:24] seven seals
[1:33:26] seven
[1:33:26] you want it all
[1:33:28] theophany
[1:33:31] he said carry all this message and when
[1:33:34] you listen to the tape even maybe i'll
[1:33:36] be gone someday when the lord is
[1:33:39] finished with me here on the earth and
[1:33:40] you'll refer back to this
[1:33:43] listen to my voice what i'm telling you
[1:33:46] if he takes me before his coming you
[1:33:49] just remember i spoke to you in the name
[1:33:53] of the lord by the word of the lord
[1:33:56] if he takes me before his coming you
[1:33:59] refer back to what's said on them tapes
[1:34:02] under my voice it's been said
[1:34:06] can i have some liberty in the name of
[1:34:08] the lord by the word of the lord and the
[1:34:11] prophet said see what is it it is
[1:34:13] vindicated words in other words brother
[1:34:15] wade what you hear on them tapes it's
[1:34:19] okay to repeat
[1:34:20] what you hear a prophet say it's okay to
[1:34:23] say and a prophecy of a breakthrough
[1:34:26] amen was vindicated words then when i
[1:34:28] heard a prophet say don't doubt just
[1:34:31] have faith and believe i believe there's
[1:34:34] a breakthrough going to happen tonight
[1:34:36] it's on the audience i didn't receive
[1:34:38] that as passing comments i didn't
[1:34:40] receive that as the words of inspiration
[1:34:42] of a man i received that as a prophetic
[1:34:45] word that somebody is going to be in
[1:34:48] laodicea under all kinds of pressure
[1:34:51] under all kinds of fears under all kinds
[1:34:53] of anxieties but they're going to break
[1:34:55] through it they're going to break
[1:34:57] through it because the word
[1:35:02] the word is in them the spirit is
[1:35:05] energizing the word
[1:35:07] oh god what did peter say he said
[1:35:10] there's an entrance somebody say
[1:35:11] entrance
[1:35:13] there's an entrance
[1:35:14] which shall be ministered unto you he
[1:35:16] says abundantly
[1:35:18] into the everlasting kingdom of our lord
[1:35:20] and savior jesus christ then what are we
[1:35:22] doing here we are entering into the
[1:35:25] influence of another kingdom
[1:35:28] what did jesus say in the model prayer
[1:35:30] he says thy kingdom come
[1:35:32] the kingdom of heaven is preached thy
[1:35:34] kingdom come thy will be done in the
[1:35:38] earth
[1:35:39] as it is in heaven are you hearing me
[1:35:42] amen thy will be done on earth
[1:35:45] as it is in heaven then what that tells
[1:35:47] me is is there's a kingdom people on the
[1:35:50] earth who is manifesting the kingdom of
[1:35:53] heaven on earth now
[1:35:58] what is his will
[1:36:00] his will is his word see then he said
[1:36:02] thy word thy will thy will be done thy
[1:36:05] word be done on earth as it is in heaven
[1:36:10] now
[1:36:11] as i try to land this this bow in 777
[1:36:17] there's one of two things going to
[1:36:18] happen to you in this age
[1:36:20] are you hearing me
[1:36:22] there's one of two things going to
[1:36:23] happen you're either
[1:36:26] going to have a breakthrough
[1:36:28] or you're going to have a breakdown
[1:36:32] you're either going to have a
[1:36:33] breakthrough
[1:36:34] or you're going to have a breakdown what
[1:36:36] brother andrew there's not that big of a
[1:36:38] difference there is a difference
[1:36:39] see a breakdown listen what a breakdown
[1:36:41] is a breakdown
[1:36:43] is a mechanical failure
[1:36:48] mechanical
[1:36:51] are you with me
[1:36:52] a mechanical failure a failure of
[1:36:55] relationship or system
[1:36:58] but watch this
[1:37:00] but a breakthrough so in other words you
[1:37:02] can have all the mechanics
[1:37:04] and still have a breakdown
[1:37:07] but but a breakthrough i love this is a
[1:37:10] sudden
[1:37:11] dramatic
[1:37:12] important discovery or development
[1:37:16] it is an instance of achieving success
[1:37:19] in a particular sphere or activity what
[1:37:22] does the word sphere mean it means
[1:37:25] domain it means realm or kingdom so
[1:37:28] peter said a entrance
[1:37:30] into the everlasting kingdom shall be
[1:37:32] preached unto you
[1:37:34] and ye shall enter in
[1:37:36] are you hearing me amen the problem of
[1:37:38] god listen i want you to hear this the
[1:37:40] problem of god standing in the
[1:37:41] discernment line he says almighty god
[1:37:43] author of life and gave her of every
[1:37:44] good gift send thy blessings upon this
[1:37:46] woman and heal her thou art here lord
[1:37:49] and this devil knows his time has come
[1:37:55] the devil knows his time has come to
[1:37:59] this woman he says entering into this
[1:38:03] fear of faith here
[1:38:05] to this woman entering this fear of
[1:38:07] faith here he knows he's got to lose he
[1:38:11] cannot hold her any longer
[1:38:14] well may i in closing may i tell the
[1:38:16] devil amen in this church service this
[1:38:18] afternoon
[1:38:20] upon these young people satan you've got
[1:38:22] to turn loose you can't hold them any
[1:38:25] longer you've tried but your power is
[1:38:27] defeated you've tried to hold on you've
[1:38:30] tried to bind them but the spirit of a
[1:38:32] breakthrough is flowing through the
[1:38:34] church there's an energy coming we're
[1:38:37] going to break through
[1:38:40] you're entering this fear of faith here
[1:38:42] he knows he's going to lose he cannot
[1:38:44] hold her any longer listen thou deaf
[1:38:47] spirit come out of her in the name of
[1:38:49] jesus christ i charge thee to lead the
[1:38:52] woman now watch this can you hear me
[1:38:55] he says do you hear me amen now notice
[1:38:58] this this was in the ear that's been
[1:39:01] deaf all the time do you realize this
[1:39:03] woman was standing there amen healed
[1:39:06] before oh god
[1:39:08] before she come in the prayer line she
[1:39:11] was already healed you say she was
[1:39:14] already healed brother zach then why
[1:39:15] didn't she come up with a good ear
[1:39:17] because there was a spirit hanging over
[1:39:19] her that would not let her fully go out
[1:39:21] yonder and believe she was healed there
[1:39:23] was a spirit i'm closing there was a
[1:39:25] spirit clamping that nerve there was a
[1:39:27] spirit shutting off her ear amen from
[1:39:30] here and what she should hear but she
[1:39:32] was already healed
[1:39:35] are you hearing me so when she stood
[1:39:37] before a prophet it was her opportunity
[1:39:40] for a breakthrough it was her
[1:39:42] opportunity to break through that spirit
[1:39:45] and go out yonder and fully believe the
[1:39:48] god that made the promise was their
[1:39:50] present to confirm the promise he says
[1:39:53] do you hear me
[1:39:54] can you hear me this was in the ear
[1:39:56] that's been death all the time do you
[1:39:58] hear me he says say
[1:40:00] a
[1:40:01] man
[1:40:03] why did he choose the word hallelujah
[1:40:05] why did he choose the word why did he
[1:40:07] choose the word thanksgiving why did he
[1:40:09] choose the word glory he chose the word
[1:40:11] amen because what does amen mean it
[1:40:14] means it's finished it means it's over
[1:40:17] it means it's settled it means jesus
[1:40:19] christ himself is the amen
[1:40:24] do you hear me
[1:40:26] do you hear me say amen i love this and
[1:40:29] you know what the sister says amen
[1:40:33] amen now it's not just a preacher who
[1:40:35] was sent with faith commissioned to
[1:40:37] preach the word of faith stand there
[1:40:39] saying amen he's a healer amen he's a
[1:40:41] deliverer amen he's a great physician
[1:40:43] but now her faith is contacted in
[1:40:46] another realm and now it's no longer
[1:40:49] just him saying it it's now her saying
[1:40:51] it i am healed do you hear me say amen i
[1:40:55] love this say i love the lord she says i
[1:40:58] love the lord say praise the lord she
[1:41:00] says praise the lord say jesus loves me
[1:41:03] jesus loves me say amen amen
[1:41:08] oh
[1:41:09] god y'all probably think i'm a crazy
[1:41:11] fanatic and that's all right amen i'm a
[1:41:13] fanatic for jesus amen i think we ought
[1:41:15] to have some life in this message i
[1:41:17] think if a woman that's been deaf her
[1:41:19] whole life amen can stand in the
[1:41:21] presence of a prophet and receive her
[1:41:24] healing then what about the church of
[1:41:26] the living god this morning are you
[1:41:28] hearing me amen i'll tell you what that
[1:41:30] devil's been doing he's been trying to
[1:41:31] cut off your hearing he's been trying to
[1:41:33] cut off your hearing what does the bible
[1:41:35] say amen he that has an ear let him hear
[1:41:38] what the spirit of god saith unto the
[1:41:40] churches and you know what when you hear
[1:41:42] something you can only repeat what you
[1:41:44] hear
[1:41:46] you know why you ain't living no more
[1:41:48] victory because the devil's cut off your
[1:41:49] hearing you ain't hearing no more but if
[1:41:52] that nerve if that nerve can come open
[1:41:54] to begin to hear the word again and you
[1:41:57] hear a preacher say you are victorious
[1:41:59] then you'll say i am victorious if you
[1:42:02] can hear a preacher say you are an
[1:42:03] overcomer then you'll say i am an
[1:42:05] overcomer are you hearing me what's
[1:42:08] happening the devil has lost his hold
[1:42:11] over you
[1:42:15] you broke through
[1:42:17] you broke through
[1:42:18] you broke through
[1:42:20] into a realm
[1:42:22] with god
[1:42:23] we're all things
[1:42:25] somebody say all things
[1:42:27] all things
[1:42:29] are possible
[1:42:31] the prophet says it this way
[1:42:33] he says if you can break through
[1:42:35] that prayer
[1:42:36] a faith breaks through
[1:42:40] he says see what it is how many knows
[1:42:42] daniel prayed 21 days
[1:42:45] the problem god said
[1:42:47] but the lord heard him the first time
[1:42:52] now watch this
[1:42:53] the angel says the prince let me let me
[1:42:57] just i'm i'm i'm closing right here
[1:42:59] then he said unto me fear not daniel
[1:43:02] for from the first day somebody say the
[1:43:03] first day
[1:43:05] thou did it set thy heart
[1:43:07] to understand
[1:43:08] and to chasten thyself before thy god
[1:43:10] thy words
[1:43:12] were heard
[1:43:15] and i
[1:43:16] come
[1:43:17] for
[1:43:18] thy words
[1:43:20] but the prince of the kingdom of persia
[1:43:22] which withstood me one in 20 days
[1:43:25] but lo michael
[1:43:27] one of the chief
[1:43:28] princes
[1:43:29] came to help me
[1:43:31] and i remained there with the kings of
[1:43:35] persia
[1:43:36] he said listen i heard you
[1:43:40] i heard you the first time you prayed
[1:43:43] i heard you the first time you asked but
[1:43:45] i was withstood but i didn't give up and
[1:43:48] daniel did you didn't give up you prayed
[1:43:51] 21 days
[1:43:52] i fought 21. okay
[1:43:54] i stood there because i knew there was a
[1:43:56] breakthrough coming that's what the
[1:43:58] prophet says if the blessings placed on
[1:44:01] you
[1:44:01] hold steal
[1:44:04] if the blessings placed on you how many
[1:44:06] will raise your hand and say the
[1:44:07] blessings been placed on me
[1:44:09] if the blessing has been placed on your
[1:44:11] blander the blessing had been placed on
[1:44:12] me go read revelation 1 3 unto him that
[1:44:15] heareth and readeth there is a blessing
[1:44:18] if you just hear this prophecy and read
[1:44:20] this prophecy there's a blessing placed
[1:44:22] upon you sometimes it's days before it
[1:44:24] can get to you daniel prayed one time
[1:44:27] and the angel didn't get there for 21
[1:44:29] days is that right he said i've seen the
[1:44:31] time where men and women would wait for
[1:44:33] weeks but the first thing you know
[1:44:36] here we go
[1:44:37] all at once it happened
[1:44:41] all at once it happened the angel
[1:44:44] passing through
[1:44:46] the neighborhood
[1:44:49] what are you saying
[1:44:51] i'm saying don't give up
[1:44:54] you're anointed
[1:44:56] to break through
[1:45:00] you're anointed
[1:45:02] to believe
[1:45:04] are you hearing me
[1:45:06] you know god still moves
[1:45:09] you believe that
[1:45:11] you believe god still moves
[1:45:14] no matter how long you've been carrying
[1:45:16] something
[1:45:17] in a matter of a moment
[1:45:19] while the words being preached
[1:45:22] you can be delivered
[1:45:24] from that thing
[1:45:26] forever
[1:45:30] back in april first night of our spring
[1:45:32] tent meetings here i was ministering
[1:45:34] wednesday night i didn't know there was
[1:45:35] a woman there who had been in a car
[1:45:36] wreck 20 years before that before that
[1:45:38] time
[1:45:40] 20 years brother bob she'd been in a car
[1:45:41] wreck she'd been carrying a fear of that
[1:45:44] car wreck for 20 years
[1:45:48] 20 years she'd been carried
[1:45:50] on the first night of that meeting while
[1:45:52] i was minister on the the attraction
[1:45:54] what is the attraction
[1:45:55] something's drawn you to it
[1:45:57] the spirit of god dropped down right
[1:45:58] there on the first night of that meeting
[1:46:00] and delivered that woman of that fear
[1:46:02] she'd been carrying for 20 years
[1:46:05] are you hearing me
[1:46:07] he's still the god of breakthroughs
[1:46:10] he still comes through
[1:46:12] you love him this evening
[1:46:14] let our musicians come
[1:46:22] listen church
[1:46:24] we're not looking for the mechanics
[1:46:26] he says we're looking for the dynamics
[1:46:28] of it
[1:46:29] he said we've got the mechanics of the
[1:46:31] religious of the bible so bottle eyes
[1:46:33] he says it looks like a great big 16 or
[1:46:35] 35 coach train sitting out here on a
[1:46:37] track
[1:46:38] he says but if you haven't got any steam
[1:46:40] in it
[1:46:40] it takes the dynamics
[1:46:43] somebody say dynamics
[1:46:46] to perform
[1:46:47] with the mechanics
[1:46:50] in desperations he says then at the end
[1:46:52] of the message you see the attraction

[1:46:55] spirit

[1:47:03] a man
[1:47:04] it's not a preacher
[1:47:06] it's not a certain congregation it's the
[1:47:08] holy spirit showing the same thing it
[1:47:10] did when it was embodied in the body of
[1:47:12] jesus christ he says now notice him turn
[1:47:15] a corner now it's embodied in the body
[1:47:19] of his bride

[1:47:33] right
[1:47:33] he had the armor he had the so he had
[1:47:35] everything
[1:47:36] but when goliath laid out his boast
[1:47:38] saul's armor broke down in the pressure
[1:47:40] of goliath's boast
[1:47:43] but david's dynamic experience
[1:47:47] stood there and said i've seen a bear
[1:47:48] come down i've seen a lion come down
[1:47:52] this uncircumcised philistine will come

[1:48:10] to be here i'd rather be somewhere else
[1:48:13] and you're thinking all these thoughts
[1:48:15] let me just let you on a little secret
[1:48:17] god hears all the thoughts you're
[1:48:18] thinking
[1:48:21] can i share a little testimony with you
[1:48:23] back in 2018 we was out at brother mike
[1:48:26] walls doing a youth camp there
[1:48:28] it was on the the second night of that
[1:48:30] meeting
[1:48:30] it was outside under a shed
[1:48:32] and we was preaching and preaching the
[1:48:34] way we was having a good service you
[1:48:35] know how he's preaching preaching and
[1:48:37] there was liberty but all of a sudden a
[1:48:39] storm coming in when the storm come in
[1:48:41] it started lightening and thundering and
[1:48:42] pouring rain i mean rain was just poor
[1:48:44] and thankfully we was under a tent or
[1:48:46] under a shed
[1:48:47] and they they the a lightning struck hit
[1:48:50] and it went i mean when it hit i mean it
[1:48:52] was like it lit up the sky
[1:48:55] i was almost ready through the
[1:48:55] microphone
[1:48:57] so i thought if it strikes this
[1:48:59] microphone this got to have somewhere to
[1:49:00] go
[1:49:04] when i did the lightning struck and the
[1:49:06] power went out in the building i mean
[1:49:07] went totally out and god's my witness my
[1:49:09] wife was here when that happened that
[1:49:12] place went into an uproar i mean they
[1:49:14] were shouting they were screaming i
[1:49:16] looked back brother mike brother michael
[1:49:17] was just weep and he was just just
[1:49:19] rejoicing shaking the power of god and
[1:49:21] in the back of my mind i'm thinking how
[1:49:23] in the world did this happen
[1:49:25] how was i standing here
[1:49:26] preaching the power goes out and the
[1:49:28] service goes to another level
[1:49:30] well brother when i did i i thought the
[1:49:33] power was out so the powers out the mic
[1:49:34] ain't going to work
[1:49:36] when i did i heard this
[1:49:39] there's no light
[1:49:41] everything's pitch black but the
[1:49:43] microphone's still working
[1:49:46] i grabbed that microphone up i said god
[1:49:48] is still god
[1:49:50] his word is still i mean and the place
[1:49:52] went into another level priests
[1:49:54] man i'm talking about it was wide open
[1:49:56] preaching then
[1:49:57] i it was actually fun preaching then i
[1:49:59] mean it was just damn
[1:50:00] you know demons flying devils flying i
[1:50:02] mean the power of god roll it was a good
[1:50:05] meeting
[1:50:05] but i left there thinking and we and we
[1:50:07] saw mighty things happen but i left
[1:50:09] there thinking why did the power go out
[1:50:12] that service go another level i pick up
[1:50:14] the microphone and go to the we didn't
[1:50:16] stage these acts
[1:50:17] we didn't get out and plan this how did
[1:50:19] this happen and for years i've carried
[1:50:21] that in my mind of what happened until
[1:50:24] the other day
[1:50:25] i was back up there preaching that youth
[1:50:26] camp a few weeks ago and i got on the
[1:50:28] golf cart with a brother and he said
