thankful for my pastor that's right I had a note here I was reading that he said something once I wrote it down five five different times and it was the word doubly and I haven't spelled it right yet and I don't know if it's in the dictionary but he said one time was doubly something about doubly and I wrote it trying to figure out how to spell that one but amen I just appreciate the word appreciate my pastor I love you change up service Open the Eyes of My Heart Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see you I want to be sing through me amen Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see you see you and lifted up shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love we sing Holy Holy Holy sing it and it I am LIF up shining in the light of your glory for your power and love is we sing holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy ho I want to see amen and amen I want to see you yes sir good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn to Isaiah 61 Isaiah 61 and acts 7 be basically the same reading but I want to show it like from the Old Testament and then coming over you know and if we can in what we're talking about I hope you enjoyed this morning I enjoyed bringing it and I pray that you you'll just it home and study it like I said if I was you I would try to get the message on the uh countdown and the uh present stage of my Ministry and listen to those over and over to uh to try to get a understanding because he explains a lot of the things and it saves me a lot of trouble and time to break it down now we got the one of the quotes back up here today but Joe was so particular on this U series until he spelled alter wrong this morning so he went back and and recopied it where he could get the word alter in the correct way but uh you know we're trying our best and they're doing their best to get everything in So Perfect an order and I told them I said don't worry about it that's that's no problem but he wanted to change it so he went back and spent his time changing it remember the Bible study 6:00 Saturday general questions we just maybe there'll be someone this maybe there'll be some some thoughts and everything and I did mess up this morning I was saying brother Wade and I went down and prayed for for brother Fred Hooper about a month ago but it was Brother Dean and I so you know just a slip in your human brain a cat Cranium C you know but just pray for us the Lord would bless us and keep all things in way and remember the family there brother Fred Hooper that has passed away and and you know just remember that okay Isa Isaiah 66 and then we'll go to the book of Acts 7 our precious Lord and our savior Our Redeemer our all in all and Jesus is your name thank you for that name thank you for everything Lord and we pray that you'd help us and guide us we realize realization that there is nothing in any of us that is worthy of anything whatsoever we are we're really not even worthy of being destroyed because there's nothing our in US worth doing it would take something to destroy us with and we're not worth that but yet you took us and you made us your children we thank you we love you and we appreciate it now just come and speak to our hearts and lives and those that'll hear the tapes and all we pray that you would just give understanding ears that we may all see you forgive our sins lead us guide us by thy Grace in Jesus name amen amen that's right Isaiah got warm up here so I get rid of my coat early I hope the put it on down if we can or whatever some's Fanning or something that was always that way but Isaiah 66 I just wanted to read this from the Old Testament then bring it over to the New Testament and try to pick up in to what we want to say so Isaiah 66 what does it say thus sayith the Lord the heaven is my throne and the Earth is my foot stol where is the house that ye build unto me and where is the place of my rest now we get over see Peter picked it up and carries it on a little bit so let's go over to acts 7 we'll start reading verse 40 4748 but Solomon built him a house how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol what house will you build me sayith the Lord or what is the place of my rest look at the next one hath not my hand made all these things you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now Heaven is his Earth Is His foottoo what place could mankind build for almighty God to come down and dwell with us how beautiful a place would you try to make they have made great shrines and things around the world to their gods great multibillion dollar buildings uh you know things that are Beyond almost looking uh real and doing but yet spending it and overlaying a lot of it with gold and and doing all kind of things because they're wanting to in some way I guess you'd call it appease their God but he said Heaven's my Throne Earth is my foot stool right now that would be a pretty good sign fell right cuz as Heaven goes as far as Heaven goes and it keeps on going you know and Earth would be your foot stool that would be you know I'm just saying that's how big my God is I don't think we can exalt him exal exalt exal him I want to exalt him and to try to bring him into the place of where that what I believe I see about him I want you to see that now we talk about this morning without backing up and and spending time with it uh we were talking about the dimensions and we live in the third dimension we live in light you know light and matter and uh we think this is a real place but then we find out about the fourth dimension that even demons travel in those diens itions and uh it would be like the Witch of indor the Prophet if you'll listen to the tapes I gave you you'll hear him explaining those things how that you know that uh that which of Endor was capable of entering into a position that she could actually enter the fourth dimension and actually bring Samuel out of that Dimension visible enough to and and and things that could be done you know through those dimension and my point has been trying to get you to see what that those dimensions are the higher we go the greater the uh the uh the more real it is we we're we're trying to hang here you know we try to hang in this world right but yet science has carried us so fast through space until you know we've entered other dimensions and things Einstein said in the fourth dimension that you could take a ball and pass it through another ball at such a greater speed that it would actually go through and never disto disturb any of the molecules of that ball none whatsoever you know and and you know those things you say they're not uh they're not capable of doing it uh I've never been able to do it but there's people that can take a straw and hold a straw and an IR potato if you if you had never seen it you wouldn't believe it take that straw and work it backwards and forth and hit that potato and the straw will go through the potato up you're in Gainsville when uh the tornado struck Gainesville in 36 they found pine needles sticking through railroad tracks y That's how fast it would mooving see and see that's what we are we're just in a dimensional barrier and things are keeping us from being able to do and some people will never because they can't believe and they'll never be able to to enter into uh other dimensions and think about things but that's the one thing that when we get back to Earth We're still up in heaven now all right when we get back down to earth we will talk about how the soul of an individual is super natural thing right all right and try to bring out those things to see that even the the soul of a sinner look what we've done look in my time in in in 71 years we went from a horse and buggy that's right yep to an astronaut and it just no limits as to what they're doing you read the other day about now that they're they're putting humanoid which is not what we called them in the old days the old days they talked about humanoids and and they were going to take the parts of a man and put him together and parts of a machine put him together and they've been able to do pretty good at that cuz they got people that can run and do things but they've got a humanoid now that can actually think out things and go into outer space and be able to make calculations and do all kind of things because it's a robot that's made for those things they actually call it a humanoid because it is cap capable of making decisions you say well is it a soul no it's not making decisions they give it 10 to make and it can make one of the 10 it's not thinking it's this this don't work that work this don't work it's got to match with one of them all the way around somewhere but you know we're in a supersonic y time and life but yet we're trying to study the dimensions to see how that each one gets greater and greater and greater and greater until we finally will one day return back to where we came from and which is heaven and I sold you this morning and I believe that a dimension signifies a limitation yeah a dimension signifies a limitation life like matter you know life like time whatever you want to call them it's a limitation M cuz it's a dimension see then in in doing that one day though all of these Dimensions will be incorporated and it'll come back to Eternity because heaven has no Dimension there's not a dimension of Heaven that's that's the one I'm talking about now and now listen get it out of your mind what I get out of your mind what I'm not talking about the Bible says the Heaven and Earth will pass away and brother brandom calls Heaven the first Millennium calls the first Heaven first the Millennium we'll get to all of those signs so don't get tied up into all of when I'm talking about heaven now I'm talking about past all Dimensions I'm not talking about even the seventh Dimension that where God is at the time right amen those are just for times and beings and purposes I am talking in all of my thoughts I've been have been keeping telling telling you ever service we are back in eternity we are not we haven't come down to our son rainb both we haven't come down the the to any Dimension yet we're just talking about Dimensions we're still talking about eternal life right that's what I'm trying to get you to see eternal life has no beginning and no ending am how can you put it in a dimension right and it's not it's not the number seven that's why your Dimensions ends with seven that's right but then eternity is an eight so then get into the future home message and study what the prophet is saying over and over and how the Holy Ghost fell on the eighth day how that Jesus was circumcised the eth day how all the things that took place and all of being the Eighth Day are eternity amen all right see because there there are great things there to be able to look at but I've tried to get you to see that that things are real and we talked about the fourth dimension and and demons traveling and and talked about cancer being a fourth dimensional disease he said all diseases are fourth dimensional all right that's why you can't kill them out you can't uh uh eradicate them uh you can you know what what is it that turns into it um um you had measles measles or which one was it that turns into these dreaded diseases today you know and you know chicken pot it turns into dreaded diseases today see they thought they eradicated it they eradicated it back as I said the cancer can be brought back down to the place to below 880,000 whatever the are of it they call it but you can never take it out of the body CU it's a demon only God could drive it out of the body now he can do that I believe in that amen but that's you know we've got to keep in there so we keep going to more or less going into more tangible and I want you to look at this drawing we were giving this morning because brother Joe and him we worked for hours up and down trying to get this to where uh you know I'm so pleased to have these is is doing it but they almost had to make their own computer programs to to be able to do some of these things and sister Esther was back there a while ago talking about Joe's doing what he done and she said I you doing something nice I said you didn't think your brother could do that did well I know I couldn't because a lot of the overlay all the things you're looking at is colorful overlays and it's not just bring it down see to me I'm just okay here make this he said well I've got to make it into this program I got to make it into this program I got to put it into this program I got to bring it into this program here we've got you know brother Anderson brother Bob sitting here out in the audience now that they can tell you A lot of that stuff is it it just took hours to be able to move this around to be able to get what we wanted to make it look in the correct order but I want you to look at something and we'll get back to it later on a whole lot more look very carefully into what is said to the souls under the altar in other words the sixth Dimension if you look in there you'll see trees you see grace now when brother randam went beyond the curtain time what did he see well he just didn't see nothing now he said people come running over the hills he said beautiful is not a word Immaculate what was the words he used he said there there nothing to it he said it's far beyond that right we know what it was real right you know those people was real right you know he could feel them right he could touch them he said now come on right that even women that you could feel and said you know what I mean yeah he said but all the sex glands was gone and there was no problems with hugging the women right see but it's real that's why I had him to put it like that with trees and things and put an altar in there because the Soul's under the altar crying how long the the sixth Dimension all right then look at the sixth going on into the seventh and then look over to the left hand side and you'll see the River of Life coming down because it can run all the way down into the sixth Dimension cuz it can run down all where man is that's cuz the sixth Dimension is the Christian remember but look up above and see heaven and you see trees and and and and we have to use clouds but clouds signify in this Dimension a a wrong act or a destructiveness because there was no clouds in the sky but yet we use them for this and I don't see anything wrong with it today you know to be able to one of these days lay down in the in in the the beauty of Eternity and see the clouds going across and see the trees and the mountains and climb Mount Everest man never even lose your breath and you know just uh you know what's uh why can't we think right what's wrong is brother Dale just a a a intellectual giant of some form you're looking at the most stupid thing there is when it comes to anything that's not that God doesn't relate to me but yet think about it heaven is real amen eternal life is real M right it's not a zap of electricity that you feel right or drops are falling and I'm not against you saying that that's what happened to you but that's not eternal life eternal life is a person right and he's the person of eternal life dwelling in you you can't explain that right how can you explain as I keep saying there 7 billion people in the world God could give everybody in the world a baptism of the Holy Ghost today you believe it right and that wouldn't make him no less right but everybody would have the person of Jesus Christ that's right one of these days we'll connect that together but you see then you get up into and if you'll notice the light is called Heaven of Heavens Heaven of Heavens see we only just take the word Heaven if you get the other one and then we'll start reading a few things but it's just more or less the next one got is more more or less you know brings it down to basically zeroing in on the seventh dimension in heaven cuz I want it in your mind to tie it all together and just to look at things and now let's read some things that the Bible says about these Heaven of Heavens Heaven of Heavens let's just pull that up brother Richard get on there the scriptures all right look at it look at the many times that it's mention I mean directly this way because you can line up other words I did just a couple but look Deuteronomy 10 and 14 says behold the Heaven and the heaven of Heavens is the Lord's thy God the Earth also with all that therein is First Kings 8:27 but will God indeed dwell on the earth behold the heaven and Heaven of Heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house that I have builded that's right we know that's coming down to like Solomon and 2 chonicles 2:6 but who is able to build him a house seeing the heaven and Heaven of Heavens cannot contain him who am I then that I should build him an house save only to burn sacrifice before him then that UN 2 Chronicles 6:18 but will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth behold Heaven and the heaven of Heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house which I have built Nehemiah 96 thou even Thou Art Lord notice capital letter alone thou H has made Heaven the heaven of Heavens with all their host and the Earth and all things that are therein the Seas and all that is therein and thou preservest them all the host of Heaven worship thee Psalms 68 and33 to him that rideth upon the heavens of Heavens now notice the other would say heaven and then Heaven of Heavens all right now it's coming down to what to the plural to him that ride up upon the heavens of Heavens which were of old Lo he do send out his voice in that a mighty voice Psalms 148 and four Praise Him ye heavens of Heaven and you Waters that be above the heavens I see two with plurals even all right Psalms 115 15 and 16 you are the Blessed of the Lord which made Heaven and Earth the heaven even the heavens are the Lords but the Earth hath he given to the Children of Men that's right all right yes sir now we're going to find out one of these days when we get started back this away you're going to see that this Earth wound up belonging to the devil and being his domain that's why we have trouble that's why I don't want to stay in this third dimension right I certainly don't want the fourth but we've got to deal with a lot of things all right now the point I want to make of the message as I said these heavens of heavens we don't have to do away with anything that's right we can just look how more positive it becomes as we're turning back to where we should have stayed heaven to me is a real place amen we wonder you know make the statement what is God to you you remember I've asked that for what 40 years maybe what is God to you what do you think he is just floating around like a glob and there was nowh for him to float because there was nothing for him to float in you know cuz there was no molecules no iron no atoms no nothing see Heaven is so much Above This atmosphere as we want to call it this life until you don't need gas mask you know you don't need uh oxygen tents and I know it's carnal and forgive me for using carnality but any of you that ever saw the movies of Superman you've seen him come from a another planet which they were they had reached a superior race of people that was interplanetary travels everything was taking place and they' reached all of that and Superman when he came to Earth that's why he had his abilities now I'm just giving you the natural forgive me but brother brandham did run around and pull this hang out of the tree and go hard like tars but you know sometimes you can learn from what you see you know and and if you'll incorporate it but visualize something of so far above how would it be if we could some way take life like it is today take it back 6,000 years to where there was no uh death sorrow heartaches troubles wouldn't that be a beautiful place wouldn't it be something if we could go back to the Garden of Eden can't you think in your mind like that but see we're not going backwards we're going forward if we went backwards we'd have trouble but think about the Garden of Eden where that the animals are there and they you know and they there's cheetah his brother ROM would say and said you know there's nothing wrong no no harm no wrongs no problems wouldn't that be a wonderful place well we're going to a place that that was created from y yep come on we'll get that we'll bring it over bring it into existence bring it up we're going to a place that that was created from but you see we're trying to get something to reality right yeah for you to think real is your God real or is he just a thought of your mind well I don't really know where brother random know what God looked like Jesus are you know might not have looked like uh Hoffman's well he never said that that was exactly what he did identically look like part he just said it's the best that he'd seen right but you see we want to argue over some situation and be in our dumb stupidity of living in this dimensional forms we're in trying to comprehend an eternal God that's it amen that can just move through space and do what he wants to if you don't get nothing out of the message today and you can do go ahead and make me anything you want to but I'm trying my best to get you to see that God is real eternal life is real it's not just a thought it's not a concept it's not a good feeling it's not a good desire a good idea right eternal life is eternal life which is almighty God Heaven is just as real right as Jesus Christ is real because we're still up in heaven now we haven't even started bringing you down to the Earth to talk about things we're still up in heaven step there with me to where he could see something you brother Dale but you sound like you're talking about a civilization existing before this I'm not talking about human civilization right right and we're not even got to the human civilization on Earth to get away from it I'm talking about the civilization that was the civilization of all civilizations yep which would be almighty God and then do you think that God is just floating around we'll get down and cover some scriptures as we condescend and eventually like I said there's a throne that develop is there in the seventh Dimension and the people are under the throne you know under the Sixth Dimension are under the throne a throne you know that somewhere in those dimensions and they have to be under the seventh there we will find a place called a white Throne judgment we will find a seat sitting there mhm according to Bible That's Right read your Bible read the book of Revelations let said this morning read five four and five and through there and see that in that doing John is describing a lot of the things that he sees when he saw him somewhere right amen yes sir that's right there'll be a judgment seat and then one one day from that judgment seat will announce an announcement listen enter ye into the joys of the Lord now which way is the person going from there right there will be people giving eternal life at the white Throne judgment right right and the Bible says enter ye into the joys of the Lord prepared for you before the foundation of the world are we still in the Bible right so there'll be people that are given eternal life that will be able to walk into eternity that's right they're not going to be held in Dimensions right that's right it won't work heaven is real that's right we'll get into it and see that Jesus comes writing back in Revelations 19 with his bride on white horses out of Heaven y right yep we'll see that there's a future home that comes down out of Heaven we'll see that there's water that they didn't consider it in Genesis that there's water that was above the heavens in other words up in heaven and there was water under the firmament down on earth right the Bible says it y that's right but what are we looking at well you're just confusing me brother Dale well now I'm as sorry as I can be I don't see how more simpler that that I could bring anything down cuz we're taking scientific and we're taking the prophet's message and we're dropping down and just simply talking because I don't have the voice to be able to preach so I just have to talk to you be like so said there by his wife she was doing pretty good this morning listening to the tapes until I got down into talking about some of these things and she jumped up and wanted to turn the thing off you know why I probably got to bothering her about me talking about TV and how that your clothes and the things you're wearing and all your garments is going right through here and God sees all of that and you're not hiding anything from anybody take your picture do what you want to slide them under the covers they're not hid am but how real is heaven to you brother random what about these heavens of Heavens what do you have to say about it all right let's start on number one on your notes what about it brother Brandon accepting God's provided way at the end time 1963 115 paragraph 35 and he's telling about the the Christian businessmen writing and saying that that what the vision brother randam had seen beyond the curtain of time and they wrote it exactly like he said it and he said he was pleased for that and see then they questioned him he said well you know Heaven is made for human beings there's no such a thing as Horses in heaven Heaven well I said I answered him back I said brother I never said I was in heaven it wasn't he under the Sixth Dimension right we read that this morning he was in the sixth Dimension I was asking where Jesus was see I never said I was in heaven I was asking where Jesus was he was still Beyond I said but if you it might help you but if it might help you a little The Book of Revelation it says when Jesus left the heavens of Heavens he was riding a white horse and all the host of heaven was following him on white horses see so that was coming from Heaven of Heavens so your Prophet knows about heavens of Heavens is heaven real brother random we would see Jesus I've give you this before 1957 number two on your notes 5:15 paragraph e56 he's talking to somebody you know in pray line or something and he said that's how we don't have to guess anymore he said heaven is real Christ is real He's Alive Tonight now not just because he made that quote out of there he was standing there Discerning out things and praying for the sick to prove that Jesus was real and proven that heaven was real your brought your Prophet brought it right here cuz he could stand here in one dimension and see somebody else and call her name and said you live at so and so street so and so and so and so even till you heard the story and he told somebody where they lived at and these people they knew them and they run around where they at and they said well run around and missed out didn't he what do you mean yeah he told you you that certain address where you live said don't live there he said I moved that's right that's the point I'm trying to get you to see if Christ is real that could discern out thing heaven is real all right going down things that are to be 1965 1205 paragraph 42 and I do not think that heaven is a place that my mother used to tell me about I believe that the church has grown from that to think it used to be a hundred years ago or two I think the old-timers used to think that everybody everyone that died went up to heaven and had a harp and and sit up there on the clouds and and played a harp now they know that there was a place called heaven now they know that there was a place called heaven but but they if that be so all the musicians would have it on us you see and I wouldn't like that I can't play music cuz I I clap off mess up I can't see but watch what he said they'd have it on us you see but it it isn't that kind of a place it isn't playing Harps at all I believe don't believe the Bible teaches that but that was a conception that we had before the fullness of the word come into existence are you reading or the opening of The Seven Seals that's promised to us in this age that we then understand now he wasn't totally putting it just on where he went right even though that was great but we didn't get to goire with him we could believe he went and come back but he's putting it in the scriptures about heaven and it being real I believe that heaven is a real place just the same as this place is a real place see for God started us in our spiritual growth here in growth in this place and I believe that heaven is a place just as real as this where we don't set up there for eternity and just set on the cloud we don't just strum our heart for all all from here ever but we're going to a real place where we're going to do things where we're going to live we're going to work a lot of people don't like that word we're going to enjoy we're going to live we're going to life to real eternal life we're going to a heaven a paradise just like Adam and Eve worked and lived and Aid and enjoyed in the Garden of Eden before sin came in we're on our road right back there again right right back the first Adam through sin taking us out the second Adam through righteousness brings us back in again justifies us and brings us back in now remember what I brought out the other day to say time the prophet said we are in here and said we were horse and buggy and he said then we went to automobile and he said then we went to airplanes and he said then we went to astronauts interplanetary travel is a type of like the Rapture the things going into the moon was a type y of of the Rapture all right so listen to what he's saying countdown 19 in 6299 the morning service paragraph 111 it's the same thing in this day of atonement we have to come in the same way come by the same way by the same message by the same Christ by the same power that they received on the day of Pentecost the same way it has been all the time the same one because it's the same door and how do we get into this body by the door and Jesus is the door to this body so we come in and are born into the kingdom of God through the door Jesus Christ and now the door is just about to close at the lady ofan Li countdown and the church is fixing to take its orbit above all tribulations all everything and soar its way into the heavens of Heavens carrying the church to the bosom of God Heaven of heavens put it R what do you think about it number five accepting God's provided way at the end time 63 11:15 paragraph 35 this is another repeat almost but it's a little bit different and they said well Heaven is made for humans and there's so no such things as Horses in heaven well I said I answered him back I said brother I never said I was in heaven I was asking where Jesus was and he was beyond and this may be a total repeat cuz sometimes I do it but if it might help you to a little the book of re The Book of Revelation that says when Jesus left the heavens he was riding a white horse and all the host of heaven was following him on white horses see that was coming from heavens of Heavens I think that is a total repeat all right next one Spirit of Truth 63 11 1118 paragraph 67 the man said there's no such thing as Horses in heaven brother brandom heaven was made for human beings not horses well I thought well usually do you see anyone like that you have to explain everything they're just trying to pick something see you can't explain God anyhow you got to just believe him but it might comfort him I said brother I never said I was in heaven in the vision I asked for Jesus and they said he was still Beyond here I was in a state like Paradise but that it might help you the Bible said in the Book of Revelations that Jesus came from the heavens of Heavens writing on a white horse and all the host of Heavens was following him upon white horses so there must be some up there in the heaven of Heaven heavens of Heaven he PR it back there where did he go and what took place Be not Afraid not to 63 606 paragraph 209 there they was just like we are today but you know what he hadn't really left them you the Bible said that he climbed up one of the Hill highest hills there was in the country so he could watch them and that's what he did when he left us at Calvary he he he when when he They Crucified him he never left us he didn't climb the highest hill but he climbed Calvary and kept on climbing past the moon stars Plumb on into the heavens of Heavens how are you go further you can see and he got so high till he has to look down on Heaven the Bible says yeah he weigh up in the heaven of Heaven ascended on high go up a far till you can't you look back down to see Heaven yet we don't believe Heaven's real oh it's just a dimensional just a mighty conqueror 1956 401 the morning service paragraph 54 when a high priest when a man has finished his work he sits down when I quit preaching I sit down but not until I quit preaching when you're working when you're working when you sit down your work is finished Jesus sat down at the right hand of glory and when he seen his first martyr listen dying for the cause of Christ the resurrected Lord Jesus brushed back the skies he must raised from his throne to give a special welcome to little Steven to bring him home there he is raised from the dead his domain reaches from eternity to Eternity he is far above every Angel every principality everything there is in heaven why his Heavens his throne is far above the heavens of Heaven God raised him up right think on these things and just read them we're talking about something real is the point living dying buried Rising coming 1959 329 the s Service Rising he justified freely forever oh no one can never can never know can never think of that great day when he rose up and the angel saw it in the heavens of Heavens the Angels sang the Praises of God and rejoiced while the Old Testament Saints in Paradise shouted Hallelujah raising he justified the heaven shook the Earth shook Paradise Shook and Hell shook when that great voice come forth up from the grave he arose Rising he justified freely forever amen you understand understand what I'm getting at everything's under his command amen he controls everything images of Christ 1959 525 the e37 oh Lord God the creator of Heaven and Earth who brought again the Lord Jesus from the dead brought him from by him by the quickening spirit of the Eternal God brought up that body that you dwelt in and has raised it up to the throne of Heaven he come to the lowest that there was in the earth The Prostitute and become the lowest servant went to the lowest city dwelt with the lest people raised the lest raised the lowest name and become the poorest of all the poor even to Nature the birds had nest and the foxes had dens but the son of man had not a place to let his head and yet that quickening Spirit who honored that true servant that made himself a servant that we might have an example to go by it raised him up from the pits of Hell brought him by the grave and brought that body out and set it in heaven in the heavens of Heavens until he's exalted so high till he has to look down to see the heavens and give him a name that's above every name in heaven and in Earth do you understand what I'm saying yes the heavens of Heavens now where did Jesus take those Old Testament Saints you may argue with me on Dimensions or thoughts for a minute but that's it's all right I just have to speak what I believe we know that the prophet couldn't go into the seventh Dimension right all right because that would be dealing with immortality which means eternal life in human flesh so he could not Ascend there where did those Old Testament Saints Go did they raise in Mortal bodies or did they raise in theophany did they raise in some form other than total immortality because I'll remind you right if you're saying that Roose is in total immortality I'll remind you some statements brother Brandon said one day he said Adam would reach over and get Eve and said eve would reach over and get abble and able to get Seth right and said the resurrection would come right it does not say that all the Old Testament Saints came up with Jesus in the in his resurrection it only says some came up with him where did they go and what happened to them now if you make it mortal bodies you're going to have to take them into at least the seventh Dimension with Mortal bodies because Jesus could dwell there and and you got a problem because why couldn't brother brandom go higher than an Old Testament Saint right you're going to have to think maybe their bodies didn't come out of the Grave I know click computers just went to running but brother Dale brother Brandon said that that Abraham said we better get out of here we might be recognized there's quite a few hundred years between the time of Abraham and the Ascension that was brought up and Abraham the man they didn't have cameras to take pictures they didn't know what Abraham looked like it wouldn't have been that they would have been standing there looking and saying here's Abraham and SAR how would they know I just talk sensual M but cus being the high priest and a man subject to the spirit of God are any of those priests right subject to the spirit of God and the world of spiritual points and they saw something moving around they might have been able by their spiritual eye not a natural eye but by a spiritual eye been able to comprehend something was taking place and Abraham says we better get out of here we're being recognized not by Abraham and Sarah but by a spiritual condition those people were spiritual people back there The Witch of indor could call up the spirit of Samuel and she was a garbage can right but she had a gift see we get over on this side over here we're going to finally get round to preach on where the Prophet said gifts and callings the Bible and the prophet said are without repentance and you know gifts and callings are predestinated eternally now I listen I'll show you how technical brother R is in the same paragraph he says the nine spiritual gifts are not predestinated eternally that's how technical brother Rand is the nine spiritual gifts are not predestinated eternally sure but he said the fivefold ministry the gifts I ordained thee Jeremiah Prophet before the world ever begun we're going to break away from some of our sugar tit doctrines to look at something and see it in reality but wherever they went and whatever they done I like the scriptures don't you let's go to Psalms 24 and7 just for a few moments I told you I'm not trying to disprove this about dementia this about that I'm trying to show us in the Bible eternal life and eternal life is a person amen this is where the psalmist strikes it look what he says Psalm 24: 7 through 10 lift up you gate you lift up up your heads or you Gates and be lifted up you Everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in get on the mighty conqueror on this the countdown the mighty conqueror the two different messages count down the mighty conqueror two different ones get on them and listen brother brand actually paraphrased it like he said there was a sound come back from inside and said who is this king of glory said the Lord strong and mighty the Lord Mighty in battle lift up your heads or your Gates even lift them up the Everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the lord of host he is the king of glory now when those Old Testament this is the resurrection of Old Testament Saints now this is not a bride Resurrection this is not anything else the Old Testament Resurrection Saints all right where did they go to brother brandom what happened all right number 11 on you notes paragraph 45 demonology 53 1112 they're getting trickers on man boy they getting fast Bob done told him he going to have to replace him because he was two two splits of a second off while ago he said you have to replace Richard cuz he's getting slow 2/10 of a second or something you had him down good listen here he is with the Old Testament Saints and I can hear them hollering lift up you ever lasting Gates and be ye lifted up and let the king of glory come in I hear the angel say what was that lift up you Everlasting Gates and be you lifted up and let the king of glory come in I hear the angels hollering who is this king of glory the lord of hosts Mighty in battle he is the king of Glory Hallelujah I can see Gabriel walking out there with his chest stro back press the button open come come the gates down through the streets this a beautiful place went Jesus Victorious with the Old Testament Saints right down through the streets Hallelujah Victory walked right up in the presence of the father listen and said father here they are they all died in faith looking to this time Hallelujah I hear him say Well done my son climb up here and sit down on my right hand till make all your enemy your foot sto oh Hallelujah keep on reading God perfecting his church paragraphs e72 1954 1204 I can see him marching as the Angelic bands beating and play and the Angels Sing Hal hosana here come the Old Testament Saints and walked up through the streets excuse me come on and Jesus walked get through the streets right up in the front of the father he said father these are those that died in good faith well done my son climb up here on my throne and sit down in my right right hand till I make every make every enemy your foot to for one of these days I'm going down to Birmington New York cuz that's where he's preaching at amen there he is the Great Mighty conqueror sitting at the right hand of the Majesty of God tonight in his presence making the intercession upon anybody here that will dare to take him by faith and God will send the Holy Ghost down to seal the kingdom what are you talking about I'm talking about a real place right I'm talking about a place somewhere up there that the Saints would be able to run down through that Jesus could run down through there with him down the streets and he could go right up before the father you say oh you sound like a trinitarian go right up before the father and the father would say Well done climb up on the throne here now and sit down beside of me I'll make your enemies your foot to one day that's right somewhere in those Realms that we looked at a sixth to seventh Dimension and total eternity comes a position and existence but there's still got to be another Journey because there got to be a journey of mankind the bride of Christ there got to be a journey of these mortal bodies that will go up through those reals be Chang the moment the twinkling an eye yep and turn out to be Eternal in an eternal heaven so how's your Heaven is it getting a little bit more tangible right a little bit more than thinking that Elohim means self-existing so he just floting around we're going to get down to find out that he could have had billions of years of living with the angels before man or anything else was ever created that's F in heaven right cuz you better remember sin didn't originate on Earth that's right sin originated in heaven amen it's according to the prophet according to the Bible and there was a battle according to to Revelations 12 I believe it just right in there Michael and his angels is what I've always tried to tell you that fell the devil he just ain't never figured all this out yet is what I tried to tell you he believed he was the anointed Sher right right-hand man of God nobody between him and God that's right y and he was standing there one day and just out stepped Michel and Satan say where did he come from it's supposed to be him and me and I still see him and I see another is this getting close to a trinity now that was God in another form right that's right that was the fell Satan couldn't handle it wasn't a battle up there that they was fighting each other we'll find out that along about that time that Michael just speaks a world into existence and when Satan gets all upset and everything's going on and he can't handle it he's finally exposed what he's doing he says to the outer Darkness Michael just speaks the word in a way Satan has to go down to this world that's right y because this is Satan's domain that's right right that's why it started in darkness without form and void cuz Michael is Christ right right right he's not an Angel that's right he's call that in the Bible but he's not an angel Christ number 13 which is the mighty conqueror e27 1958 329 as they hollered back to them who is this king of glory the Old Testament Saints screamed the Lord of hosts Mighty in battle you know the scriptures the great Angel Gabriel must have pray press the button those great big doors folded back right under the arch of The Old Rugged Cross went Jesus and the soldiers of the Old Testament cuz remember Jesus died once for all on the cross was once for all okay so that's what he's saying right under the arch of The Old Rugged Cross went Jesus and the soldiers of the Old Testament right down through the streets of Jerusalem they went in with angels singing and screaming what a welcome home right down through to the great white Throne now we're picking up a great white throne and he said father these are those that believed on you I've conquered both death hell and the grave and I can hear the father say sit on my right sit on my Throne right sit on my throne here son until I made the LI enemy thy foot to and Jesus climbed up at the right hand of the god of Heaven on his throne on high there he stands tonight a few hours ago he said Till The Mighty conqueror paragraph 31 586 10 I know that they said when Hitler conquered France and that he stood at the arch of the tribe where German soldiers by the endless miles marched through in the plains black disguise they were all there to celebrate their Hitler's great coming into France how they brought Stalin into Germany but oh brother when the church brought Jesus in that day lift up the Everlasting Gates and be you lifted up and let the king of glory come in and the angel said who is this king of glory and the Old Testament Saints cried back the Lord of hosts Mighty in battle the great conqueror he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men the Bible said he did e32 the mighty conqueror is still reading and you talk about a welcome home as the Angels over them great Pearly Gates as they swung open and Jesus right down through the streets of Glory with the Old Testament Saints behind him singing all hail the power Jesus there and he come up in the front of the father's throne and father said father here they are they were Faithful over a few he said get up here son and sit down on the right hand until I make all thy folds thy foot stool there he stands tonight it is I Be not Afraid 196 329 paragraph e23 and he climbed to the ra ramparts of Glory went on in above the moon and stars in his resurrection the prophet said when he got so high up there that maybe him and the Old Testament Saints on the road up why I can see the Angels looking over the gate and they screamed out in there the Old Testament Saints said lift up ye Everlasting Gates and be ye lifted up and let the king of glory come in and the angels beyond the gates said who is this king of glory that's coming in The Lord of hosts Mighty in battle they pressed the button the big Gates flew open and Jesus and the Old Testament Saints marched down the street conquerors oh my up to the throne of God and said here they are father stand on my right hand till I make all the enemies your foot to and today sets all in power and glory and watching over it just like the old eagle you see what I'm talking about Beyond us is a reality Beyond us is more real than the existence we live in controlled by the Holy Spirit places that you and I can go and see around the land are beautiful been to the Grand Canyon and just stand up there on the top and look down for miles just straight down and think them tell me that there was a river wash that out I'm just too old to believe it but ROM said all that happened in the Ice Age big chunks of ice just come down through there and cut out all them States made all them things I just couldn't never believe that that water just running there done but beautiful places that we can go beautiful places that you can go just sit down in a refreshing and you know what I mean you just like you just don't want to leave it it's a beautiful place but the greatest of all of that there nothing compared to what you and I have in store Paul that went to the third heaven he said I can't even tell you what I saw right he said I have not seen ear hath not heard what has entered what is there waiting on us right a heaven amen that one day all Dimensions will be done away past may I use it in the way I want to use it all of these Dimensions will pass away not be annihilated right they will change in form and pass away the world will still be here sure all of those things will still be here yes brother BR said go out down through there be that in the Millennium for 500 years years or something said the sisters just looking at the flowers just walking along just a millennium he said Here Comes cheetah and they just just pet it why cuz Satan's bound that's right just clean out those Dimensions don't destroy them just clean them out wash them up it was made for a purpose they serve their purpose Y and they can be incorporated into whatever God is don't try to annihilate anything well I want hell not be done away with it will be cuz death and hell will be cast into the Lake of Fire right the prophet said not only will it be a physical burning he said but it'll be a spiritual burning to burn up all the demons all the powers and existence but heaven is real amen we came from there now you believe it's back there no that's people I've taught you don't go that way now somebody on the new listen in don't you got to go backwards now because Brother D ain't got time to explain it I don't believe in little people running around like a Mormon doctrine of pre-existence cuz even in the heaven existence when he was Elohim is not like what I've tried to bring to you that he'll step over into another dimension another form another way word form then we begun to come into view not as little people standing around in the do but I thought we believe we were the body of Christ a body of Christ don't have 18 s the other day some guy was SE over there Got U two extra toes and two extra fingers so they call him number 24 you know cuz and my cting stops
