church service now you have your Bibles turn into the book of First John I told sister Brenda downstairs I said and uh somebody else was standing there brother Donnie I think it was um you know Jesus I could make this sermon the the title verily verily our brother random said if God said something twice you better listen to him well Daddy asked me to preach a couple days ago you know so I got to thinking and and he was we were talking about what I was going to preach in Saint Augustine so I want you to preach on the appearing in the coming well something struck me at work Friday morning so you're going to hear this morning's sermon all over again he didn't know that but that's okay God did so maybe somebody didn't get it this morning maybe you'll get it in a simpler way maybe this afternoon okay so if I say some of the same things just forgive me um it's what I had wrote down and I'm not going to change it because God didn't change it all right first John 2 let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for the day thank you Lord for the opportunity to be here behind this sacred desk with no father that we are speaking to the best of the best the last but the greatest people to live on the face of the Earth father we pray that you just come Among Us now in a special way heal all the sick be with the ones that are sin sick Lord the ones that are backslid Lord the ones that are dilatory the ones Lord that as our brother was preaching this morning that that needs to awake you out of History father we pray that you would just come Among Us uh through your profit you told us one time that Jesus they even take he'd even take second seed or third seed or fourth whatever you asked if Simon was asking him to come to the to the party there and Jesus just took the back seat father you said you would but father we want you to take preeminence today you take the front seat and you be the author and finisher of the Faith Lord of the people that are here we pray Lord now that all the things we've spoken Lord the announcements that each one Lord will be your anointing will be on each one father as we go and Lord try to serve you through the ministry of feeding the children but Lord save their soul father give them spiritual food that they may take it back with them Lord and may it nurture them and and raise them up in the admonition of you Lord just be with us thank you for getting Mom back here Lord and just bless her just take care of us I know you have and you will if we stay in your word father just bless it now keep us safe in Jesus name amen first John 2 verse 28 and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming all right second Timothy one just turn back just a little bit second Timothy one excuse me verse 10. verse 9. who have saved us and called us with a holy calling everybody got it second Timothy one who has saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works thank the Lord but according to his own purpose and Grace which has given us in Christ Jesus before the world began but it but that's nice to know Paul's saying that's nice to know that we were thought of before the foundation of the world but it's now made manifest in other words he's brought it down to present by the appearing all right of Our Savior Jesus Christ who has abolished death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel you may be seated in the Lord and his Blessing to the reading of the word thank you each one for being here good to see sister Regina if we had all these half timers and part-timers if y'all all come to church services we'd have enough people to have church and I'm not talking to Regina like that I'm talking to everybody right I just like to see everybody back somebody said something the other day and I said if the people that were just backsled and didn't come to church would all come here we'd have a crowd and the one that had left and and I know you know pray for brother Robbie he's trying to come back I prayed that boy for a long time that the Lord's gonna have to get him out get it just like he did me got to get him in a way to where he can't get out he did me sister and he got me in a way where I couldn't get out and I couldn't depend on my natural family to get me out I had to depend on my heavenly family when you depend on your heavenly family then that's the whole that's the whole deal you call for the heavenly father you're a natural father can help you so far but he can't help you in the way that your heavenly father can help you so we thank the Lord for uh everybody being him we love to see people here but today we're going to speak on his appearing Reveals His coming his appearing Reveals His coming all right because now brother Dale's been preaching on how the appearing and the coming is two different things and that's exactly the truth but also we see that if we take that same appearing it has something to do with his coming because without the appearing he's not going to come right without the appearing because remember appearing is what something you can see is something visible without his appearing we're not going to understand his coming right because you and I are just humans we have a we have a um a brain that we don't use most of the time and what part we do use is most the time wrong right or mine is anyway but that word appears there in in first John I love the little John's he was real um um real adamant about seeing God because he just got back from the Isle of Patmos and and he was being a pastor to the church there at Ephesus and he's saying just love everyone and and looking for the appearing and and just watch John as his attitude is is he just wants everybody to be saved but that part of appearing we saw that and you still probably got the quotes that brother Dale gave me I didn't bring any with me like that for that I just brought some little tidbits and you're gonna find out this sermon came from a most peculiar place in the Bible um I was uh yesterday I guess it was the day before I was sitting reading um brother Branham was preaching in 1956 he was preaching about the the um meanest man in the city and it was Simon that had invited Jesus to a feast and we know what happened with Mary and alibabaster box and all that well that just to me that shows the appearing and the coming and two groups of people there the woman that was a real Fame and the Pharisees that were supposed to be this religious group they saw him he appeared at the home but they missed his coming all right but now that woman type of the church that woman that was so deep and dark in sin she got the appearing and the coming because she typed us and we'll get to it in just a minute but that word there appear means to make known and if you look in some of those um things that that gave you the the quotes if you'll look up the one that says apocalypso which means Revelation right right and that is actually the Book of Revelations is actually in the original it is called the Apocalypse it's actually apocalypse the revelation of Jesus Christ are the apocalypse so the appearing means the revealing are to become visible visible to show be manifested to be this is what I like to be plainly recognized see now he could be recognized in many ways but to be plainly recognized and this end time is the only time I believe he was plainly recognized right right plainly Vindicated and then the one of them is up to nomia where you get the word Optometry which is what you go see the optometrist the eye doctor our vision when when Elijah and Moses appeared on the mount Transfiguration in the Bible that word appeared is which is vision what you see now keep these two words in mind keep this phrase in mind during the whole the whole sermon we must have revelation before manifestation right that's right we must have revelation before manifestation or we must have appearing before coming right right all right now brother Branham said in the Bible it spoke of Jesus's coming since the Book of Genesis right you say how do you get that all right look it's the way the way God appeared in the Old Testament was revealing part of his coming right because remember he comes three times he came first time to redeem us right right then to get us right and then come back with us right all right now he came in the Book of Genesis he was trying to reveal himself right if Eve would have waited for the program of God to take effect God would have come right there to those people in the way he wanted to in people right not in animals not indoors or or you know things of the world he wanted to come in people but when he did what she did that didn't stop the plan of God that actually made the plan of God more manifest right right and actually to me it made it more simple it made it more simple to see that how God wanted us all saved we had a choice and he is predestinating because of that choice and he sees the end from the beginning right so he's going to make the end be the same as the beginning like we read this morning in Bible study and Sunday school class that the word God the word God in the beginning is the same word as God in Revelations 22 that same God is spelled the same capitalization and everything that has come from the beginning he says I'm Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end well when it said in the beginning God made Heaven and the Earth is the same God but what's he done he's brought it right together but in between that is a journey that's one of it we can take the appearing and let it reveal is coming because it can be a Journey Through Time to show you and I who us no God right amen all right now but he appeared to many remember the Bible says after his resurrection they saw him but did they get the Revelation I don't think so I don't think so but now let's keep this in the back of your mind Satan can impersonate the appearing right yeah amen but he cannot impersonate the coming right when it's to you the reason I said that is we're going to read in Thessalonians where he said he's going to come down as an angel of Light and deceive he's coming same c-o-m-i-n-g is the same one that talks about Jesus talks about the Antichrist coming all right so be careful let's just don't say this Parsi is just God's presence you take that and run it all the way through the Bible and it does it says the same thing about the Antichrist he's coming as an angel of life right to deceive you right and if you hadn't caught the coming of Jesus Christ you're going to get that coming that's right okay everybody understand that that's okay but Satan can impersonate the period appearing because what is that that's a sense we see to our eyes but now let's look in the Old Testament let's start with Cain you know you know me and the way I do things I try to start in Genesis and try to end up in Revelation so in the Book of Genesis you see Cain what did Cain what did he put all of his emphasis on revelation appearance appearance what did Satan want more than Michael he wanted a kingdom that appeared better yeah than Michaels so there started in heaven dropped right down on Earth what did King do King started building an altar just like Abel but what he wanted to put on it was something that looked good to the eye that was beautiful it was enticing that he thought he could draw God to him look at Abel Abel got a revelation of something and it's very important what that Revelation is right because it's going to hold from the beginning to the end right and that's blood right amen glory that's the blood Cain did not get a revelation of the blood right he saw the appearance oh this is going to look good mom and dad are really going to enjoy this God you you're gonna have to accept my sacrifice because I have put all the potatoes in the right place I've got the right color he was a Master Gardener I'm sure he had all the flowers arranged over here the blue ones over here the red ones over here the pink one's over here I bet it looked beautiful walk in the Roman Catholic Church you'll see that same thing that Cain did the same things the same devil Same Spirit that was in Cain just came down in the Catholic church and they put the brightest the most beautiful colors and they have everything what appearance they want that Pope to appear right they want him to appear with the Rings and all the signals and all those things but what did Abel get he got a revelation of the coming of Jesus Christ right because he did it through the blood it had to be a lamb sacrifice it had to be something dirty not dirty as far as what we know but you understand it doesn't look clean it did not look good so it wasn't the appearing you got it right it wasn't appearing it was a revelation of what had happened right and what was going to bring them back into the garden right with a blood right now we know that was the substitutionary blood right let's go and get that mixed up but it spoke of something right that it would be blood all the way down and blood was what was going to put us back into the Garden of Eden right all right non-appearance that's what the Catholic Church things they think they're going to get back into heaven because everything looks so good everything's so beautiful everything's in order everything's so nice all the colors are all you know they're just beautiful Stephen John on the Isle of Patmos had to stop and admire it he was a boarding in Christian he stopped and admired that that now so we see that Abel saw he saw past the appearing right to the coming amen amen all right because the first comment has to be blood this last coming's gonna have to be blessed or this coming not the last but to this coming right right and then read Revelations 19 he comes back riding with us in the Millennium on a white horse with white on his thank you blood right on his vesture all right Joyce the blood we'll never you and I will never forget the blood right we may forget all the appearances and all the things like that but you'll never forget the blood of Jesus Christ is what's going to put us into Glory all right now God appeared to Abraham in a form that he could see but now remember God became visible to Abraham right but that's not the same visible God that you and I see right man he said now you're talking about two guards no you're remember let's look at this the eye thing look at look look Abraham saw Melchizedek all right Glory we don't worship Melchizedek we worship what Melchizedek become right right we know but what was that that was a journey of Jesus Christ coming down so that he could walk in human flesh and it not Shock us folks I believe the whole if you just if you just asked me to sum up the message of the hour the whole Bible the whole Plan of Redemption is God did this whole thing to make it so simple that an illiterate person that can't even read or write that will believe in him he'll put them in the Kingdom of Glory come on you can talk about seals and clings and vials and trumpets and Dana 70 weeks that's okay and that's needed right but when it comes down to where the rubber meets the road is is you have to believe in that blood and an illiterate person you can tell him about Jesus Christ and what he did for him and he God can birth him in the Kingdom all right so let's don't make this thing too high well we can't see it are too low but we don't have to see it but he appeared spoke of his company right right amen Abraham meeting God in human flesh spoke of what would happen when God would come literally in his first coming and his second coming right right and his third coming is going to be God in human flesh with what a bunch of little gods in human flesh all right but it's one true Living God right all right everybody okay Shake Yourself and wake up a little bit but in all the Old Testament the reason that God was above us in the Old Testament is he couldn't come down into the individual because of that substitutionary blood right was just pushing send back to when he would come the first time right but it all was in part we know in part we prophesy in part but that which is what perfect has come all right that which is in part will be done away well that's what happened in it from the Old Testament to the New Testament and now that happened you and I in this end time that which is perfect to come that which is in part you don't do away with a seven Church ages you don't do away with all the Old Testament but it's done away because why you don't see that anymore you see you and I right that's what I want you to see his appearing he appeared like brother down said he can appear to the Baptist the Methodist the Pentecostals and without a new birth they will miss his coming right that's right he's only going to come and get one special group of people that's right that's who he's coming for amen all right and I just want to lay something in here just for a little I want you to think about this and I don't we're in a mixed crowd but the world has picked up on a lot of these things about the coming as far as God coming and and like Dad said it's a uniting come on and send it like brother Gerald is an invisible Union right it's God coming to his bride right right okay now I know we're in a mixed audience but there's a lot of things you can say about that that the world that which is worldly junk but it does mean something that God is coming to a group of people right he's coming to be intimate with a group of people hey amen not just to appear come on the appearing is nice come on but the coming see appearing is like brother Gerald said you can appear at my front door and come in but you're not going in the bedroom with me all right only my wife goes into that park right all right so he's trying to become intimate to get us out of the the the the kitchen and the and the living room hey living room is a wonderful place to sit and talk me and brother Donnie we can talk for hours and hours and hours about God and about uh guns and about hunting and whatever you know but when it comes about 10 o'clock at my house you need to go home that's right amen I told a group of people I'm not a group but a husband and wife one time when I was getting up real early going to work I told a group of people I said that was at the house I said look I said y'all sit up and talk to each other all night I said just lock the door when you leave but I'm going to bed and I think they left shortly thereafter but but you understand what I'm saying amen and entertain plenty of people in your in your living room right but you better not entertain but one person in that bedroom all right understand Jesus Christ has come to do one thing and that's to take a bride for himself right not another but for himself but he appeared to Abraham let me get finished I wasn't going to be I'm just going to be a little short today but in the Old Testament it was God above us even to sit down and Moses said he talked lit to ear face to face with God Moses never saw God like you and I are going to see God Amen right right because Moses wasn't a born-again Christian I don't understand why these people in the in the message well I do I do it's then they don't have a background they're not taught right okay all right that's the true Brother Gary I I'm sorry it's the truth uh I believe Dad tried to tell him that and The Minister's meeting kind of trying to do it kind of subtly instead of just coming right out and telling them he was trying to suddenly telling them said look if we don't get these virtues right how are you going to get them right we got to bring these virtues into US make them manifest before we can bring them to you right amen so that you can make it manifest right some of the brothers were saying hey why are people or you know why aren't our people still are stuck what Daddy was saying he'd said well you're stuck foreign thank God for a pastor right it's not stuck all right and you know what there's got to be somebody to pull off that gift that's right so don't think yourself yourself no lower you had to pull to get it out that's right okay so we may be the we may be the out scour of the message but who cares blessing all right but in Moses Moses saw him he appeared the Bible says and many times the Bible says God appeared remember God appeared to the people in The Burning to Moses in the burning bush but now did Moses see God he saw him for his time but he did not see the fullness of God he did not see God manifest in blood we're talking about blood here we got to get blood on the scene all right even melchizedek's blood even the blood that was going through melchizedek's veins was not the blood that saved me and you only the blood of that virgin born son of God Amen the one that was born and he was a son of can die for your sins if he wasn't a Kinsman he cannot take your place Melchizedek was not our Kinsmen now president was showing God and his journey down to man but he spoke that body in spoke that body out and that body is not my sacrifice today laying on the altar that's right all right not taking anything away from Melchizedek because there's a wonderful thing that Melchizedek did coming to the believer of that day right but a greater than Melchizedek is here amen whatever Melchizedek did a greater than he is here today right amen because we had a man come that had the blood of almighty God sinless took on our sin so that we can be sinless right and now it's in you and I right amen right he appeared to Daniel as the angel ain't showing that he that he judged but showing that he would appear to someone in the Old Testament but not be a coming hang on remember the first coming we got to get blood here there was no blood of God in the Old Testament right right that's why there was no Born Again believer in the Old Testament the Old Testament except Adam was imparted eternal life God created him right gave him eternal life the prophet said blasphemus name but in the Old Testament that's why the substitutionary blood couldn't save people because it was a blood of an animal right not the blood of a Kinsmen right once that Beast line was done away with there's no connection with man and an animal again right see while that Beast was there you could come all the way up through Creative Evolution right catch a beast and then catch a person he could either he could either uh procreate with the with a human or procreate with the animal but when God did away with that and put that division in there no more animal blood was going to take away sin it could push it back right but it couldn't take it away right all right but still though Abel had that revelation of the coming of God that God was going to have to come in blood right right to give his blood right to come back and bleed on you and I which is the bleeding word of God but now look all the prophets of the Old Testament spoke of his coming first coming but they only got the appearing the vision the sign the seeing everybody understand that it was the first coming he came in human flesh it had to be the blood of God all Prophet spoke of this that's why God was above us that's why Brother Gary God couldn't get in US he was above us in the Old Testament but when he came and gave his blood gave his life he could dwell in US right right and then come back and get us because of what he did right when he came here to redeem us that's right right I hope you see that because I want that dwell in your mind because it's going to help you know more and more as as we go forth I was just going to ride a couple of pages and I had to stop almost three pages of notes that that I got especially like off the sermon this morning but now listen think about this his first coming when he came as a baby when he came as Jesus Christ his first coming Vindicated that he did appear to all those Old Testament Saints do you understand that if he had not come like they said they would have all been Liars yeah and they would have missed his appearance right but they came down and as he appeared to each one Isaiah Ezekiel all those down through there Daniel Moses he was appearing to him showing a part of his self but he couldn't come into the person right because of that substitutionary blood was keeping with a buffer all right but when he came in human flesh that Vindicated the Old Testament right that Vindicated when he come on the scene that Vindicated right you're going to see that because then whatever made him vindicate with the prophets said in the Old Testament guess what in his second coming if he don't come the way that he's supposed to in the Bible that we missed the appearing in the coming both right right everybody understand that it is as the Old Testament prophesied and he comes down and he appeared Hebrews 10 and 5. in the volume of the book is written of me what the Torah all the things that were written in the Old Testament right and the volume of that book was written that they were preparing a body right for God to dwell in amen amen and then God said hey I'm going to vindicate that because I'm going to do exactly what they said because that's me that said it right right right right this Bible cannot be fallible it must be infallible right now the person that that that's trying to reveal itself wrote it right so it's got to be perfect amen if this ain't perfect I'm gonna hold on to this right well this is going to get us somewhere amen but he hid in all those many forms but there was no Union in the Old Testament between God and man right he would anoint that's right and then it would come off right he would anoint Moses and and they would have to Veil his face he was so close amen so close to God to what Moses spoke was what God was thinking right Moses just spoke but yet when that anointing came off Moses he could kill an Egyptian he could Smite a rock see what the Holy Ghost he wouldn't have Smith The Rock that's right he would have done what God said he spoke to the rocks say but he didn't do that there had to be a denomination set up you say boy denomination well that's what Cain did yeah right denominations they get his appearing people yeah and let me let me get a little closer if you're not born again this morning afternoon that's right you just see the appearance that's right you just the carnival amen the bright lights and you know what's wrong everybody going around the ferris wheel having a good time right but until you get in that Ferris wheel you're just an onlooker come on brother you're not a participant come on Amen so you're just looking from afar off that's right and you're gonna miss his coming just like the rest of the people you said oh I'm right in the coming of the Lord this is the coming of the Lord I'm right in it but I don't want to ride that ride come on I don't think I'm gonna go in there and get a ticket for that that'd be too hard no oh my you gotta take it off people that's right but now God is with us now he was above us he was with us when he appeared in coming forth from a virgin the appearing all those appearances down through the Old Testament remember what the word appearing means reveal make known make manifest all right and now you can see too even in the New Testament and don't get me wrong I I followed the line and I may take another line on that later on but I think it was Jude or one of them said at the appearing well see the appearing in the coming is now to come together there used to be an appearing all right and a comment all right and a journey in between I'm just what I'm going through now but in the end time now the appearing and the coming is together right because when he appears we appear with him right see so let's just don't stay with a peer that appears bad and coming is good in the end time the appearing in the coming comes together all right you see God and he is God Amen I'm pointing to brother Danny I have no problem with that right I know it's hard for you to believe I'm talking to Joyce best therapist Danny ever had absolutely but even when God himself appeared on Earth it was hid even his first coming right everything that the Old Testament spoke of he walked right out and said here I am and they did not believe it that's right because they missed the appearing part right all right now see if you can swallow this the first coming was in a process and he'd come up to the River Jordan and he'd come up to a place to where God said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell all right all right and now after that he began preaching right right but what did he preach on did he preach on his coming first here are the one coming the second coming remember brother Adam said he preached 90 of his sermon was when the son of man when the son of well the son of man was standing there right but they weren't getting it right they weren't getting it that's right so he was prophesying of a group coming right oh I was thinking about this the other day people don't understand the little stories that brother Branham tells he comes up to the questions and answers on the seals and remember he starts talking about God and simplicity again he starts talking about he said through this building is people right he said angels he said but it's like a radio and in a radio especially back then not now back then your radio had a little crystal in it a diamond I'll give you a little story true story I don't know what it is now it may be electronically fixed but in your dial when you come across to a place Aaron can probably tell you about it there was a crystal diamond and it was cut a certain way and that picked up that megahertz or that sound wave and it transferred it into your speakers and that's that's why you got 55 am 55 you got am 750 you got 680 you got 1280 you got 1100 on the FM side what that's the megahertz that that that that that dial is set up to to receive now that's what brother Brown was explaining but right before that he said he said from you and you're not going to get it right right remember he started telling him he starts home he said it's not for you he said he said just go on live a good simple Christian life then he goes right into the to the dial and I thought well praise God what brother Brandon was saying is he said there's nobody sitting there that day that was in tune with what he was saying but there was a group of people coming and I'm one of that group amen that God could dial it in yes and he cut me the right way 40 years later it may have been sister Brenda but he dialed that dial and each one of us picked up amen amen the receptor right right that's what he was telling him people he wasn't just talking about a radio station right he was talking about that God was a was appearing through that building and through that little Prophet but they were missing it because they didn't have the right crystal he didn't say anyone born again he said they didn't have the right receptor to pick it up but you know what if you and I get it in the end time he was talking about me and you sorry we had the right we have the right receptor to pick it up now but his ministry spoke of his second coming more than his first coming why because the prophets had already told about it first coming right he didn't have to dwell sure he would say something about Moses but who who was he talking to Pharisees right he said Moses in your law says right yearbook go read what Moses said about me yeah man yeah but he also spoke of the second coming but this is where I got this this part that I was you know looking at the other day at work and because God appeared to the Pharisees now here's the coming of first coming of Jesus Christ God in human flesh he's on Earth and he's doing a job he's sowing the seed of the of the Kingdom right he was the son of man who saw the seed so in the seed sowing the word sowing you and I aren't showing the word so that you and I can grow and nurture but he walks up to a group of Pharisees one day and Simon one of the Pharisees was having a gathering and he asked Jesus to come but the reason he asked Jesus to come was was to ridicule him not to make him known right now the greatest religious group Simon was a well read uh I got the book back in the back I can't remember the name of it but it was uh the unwelcome Christ I believe it was 1956 is where I'm reading from but just read that because brother Brown he's a greater Storyteller than I am he's the greatest Storyteller that ever lived he can make you think like you were sitting right there with him and he was telling the story he said Simon come up he was having a gathering and asked Jesus to come and he said if you invite Jesus he'll come he'll appear right but what you do with him when he gets there that's it that makes the difference amen so it's what you do because Simon could have invited invited him in Brother Richard and he could have invited him in and they would have put that oil on his face they would have put they would have put the uh they would have set him down and washed his dirty feet brother Brown goes through all that and talks about the the dung of the cows and the horses being on his feet and how that it was a soothing thing for them to take and wash your feet and put the oil you know the the the um olive oil all over you you know and get you to smell good and then invite you in with a kiss and a hug and you were welcome he said then he said man if you did that to me in so many words he said if you did that to me and sister Trudy said make yourself at home she better not mean it if she I mean she better not say it she doesn't mean it all right because I'm gonna go kick my shoes off and I'm gonna go sit on her chair and I might put my feet on the coffee table if you tell me to make myself at home I'm going to the last one they said that you know that's what brother Brown was explaining said well Simon should have welcomed Jesus and said just make your sense at home but yet he didn't do any of that here's the key he wanted to see Jesus at his house appearance right a draw he thought he could get a bunch of people there to ridicule and to make fun of Jesus and there was Jesus with dirty feet remember said he'd come in through the back and one of the foot washed flunkies thought he was a foot wash funky and nobody watched Jesus's feet nobody done the things that they were supposed to do for him you know and take the dirt off of his neck but here was a woman and thank God that woman had many problems that woman had many husbands she had many denominational ideas but when she saw Jesus saying now the appearing to her was different than the appearing to Simon and it was in the same setting in the same house right wasn't anything different it was apparent to the eye so what did she do she saw a man she said brother Brown said she she thought back in her mind back two weeks ago three weeks ago a month ago she said I was going through Jerusalem and said he was there and Healing The Sick raising the Dead blind eyes could see and said he was so compassionate and said come unto me all ye that labored heavy ladies and she said oh I couldn't come to him said I was way back in the crowd said I was scared to come to him said but something now has drawn me to him Glory the Deep call to the Deep there was something in that woman she didn't see the appearing like the Pharisees saw the appearing same way with the world today people you can sit right here today and God can appear to you and you can say Amen to everything I say but unless his second coming is here you'll be just like those Pharisees it'll be Jesus with dirty feet all over again but she goes and she does something real strange she's used to the trade that she's in she's used to the men giving her gifts she was a prostitute right she was used to the men giving her gifts right right she was used to taking money from the men them you know giving over to her and and the draw was from the man to her but this man never drew like any other man Drew before the whole situation was turned around she goes and gets her money and she says oh I know he'll know where I got this money from see people that your life to God doesn't matter if you'll do like she did right take everything he said she took everything she had and she went to that man and she bought that alabaster box of ointment she didn't just keep it and go put it back up and use it during a good time right said she took it to Jesus right and got down on her hands and knees and washed the feet of the creator and Simon was standing right there beside of her and he missed the whole thing but see that was the bride coming to the bridegroom right because he looked at her and he said all your sins which me have now been forgiven that's all of us people that's all of us right she got the coming right Pharisees got the appearing and they're gonna have to appear one more time in front of it right you and I that's why I say our the appearing and the coming to you and I are going to have to come together all right because we don't go to a white Throne judgment and have to appear before God again right but everybody that missed his coming they just saw us appearing are going to have to appear before him one more time and they're gonna have to give an account of what they did when they saw him the first time but you and I that are born again that overlaps because he's got to reveal before he makes Manchester manifest right does it reveals it makes it manifest all right now carry on just for a few minutes but here we see her washing his feet her giving everything she had she was submitting herself right she was doing something totally out of character and that's the same way with you and I Our Lives we do something totally out of character when God comes to us and calls us her washing showed that there was more than just the appearing of a man right sitting on a bench because there was none of those Pharisees even though if she would have went up and confessed her sins to those Pharisees neither one of them could have looked at her brother Colin said your sins which are many are now forgiven right so she met the very one that she needed to me and then he had come in a type he had come to get her don't you think Jesus knew why he was in that spot he come to get that bride that woman he come to get her he knew Simon would would turn him down but he went and sat down in that seat knowing that she was coming same way you know we looked at the the armor Meat Packing Story now that young nice looking guy from Chicago he didn't just appear to the watch Girl he appeared to the three sisters right then he revealed himself to the wash woman and there was something about her that he liked right the other three thought well he surely he's going to come and get me but the only reason that that man came back was to get her Gloria she got to coming the other three sisters got the appearance right in the same house let's don't let that happen to us people let's do not let that happen to us but listen to this here's a little something to remember your attitude toward his appearing brings his coming amen your attitude toward his appearing brings his coming because you got to bring him on the same he's got to come here right for us to go there right right that's what's happened he appears just like after the resurrection he appeared to 500 Bible says he appeared to over 500 brethren now why didn't those 500 go to the upper room I'm gonna tell you something sister Trudy if you were dead and I knew you were dead and three days later you come and peered back I'd go to your house he couldn't get me out right but the Bible said he appeared to over 500 people brethren so I went Sinners right Brethren right right they got his appearing Believers that's what he said 500 Believers Brethren people that believe right but they got caught up in the appearing amen and they didn't go to the upper room and get his contact amen okay that's the way you and I people that same way people from a mess those two brothers that's right walking down that road right they said the Bible said he appeared in a different form right well the only different form he could be was he was younger than they knew him yeah exactly he was just younger that's right he died looking like this yeah but he rose and there's not a picture of him of what he looks like when he rose because he's just a young kid young boy but that's what happened the the two from a mass but what happened they got to a place and they walked in and they sat down with him he appeared to him but when he got down there he done something that he had done in his first coming I believe he broke the bread and another piece popped back on it and they said there's God again the Creator and he vanished her lips don't miss the coming of the Lord now first Peter 1. let's read and then we'll finish up here and and I may just stop it and pick it up a little bit later sometimes you know you try to come to everybody wants to come to a climax or what they call in the Opera Crescendo or the you know the high note but sometimes you can't but sometimes I just want you to chew over this and then we'll talk about a little bit later that's just the way I am I don't you know and evangelists are good at that they're real good at bringing you you know like brother Jewell said you up and out down you know but I I'm just not built that way First Peter 1 verse 7. that's the trial of your faith being much more precious than a goal that perishes they'll be trying with fire now this is this is the 120. this is this is uh after after Calvary after the 120 after the upper room this is the in Us Part remember above us with us and now we're going to talk a few minutes about in us all right First Peter 1 verse 7 that the trial of your faith being much more precious than a goal that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing and even the even the uh Schofield if you had a Schofield Bible it says Revelation that word appearing is translated into the word revealing our revelation at the revealing of Jesus Christ everybody see that's why that's why I said you have to watch these things they're deceiving Satan can slip in and he can he can show the world that oh when Jesus appears we're going and Jesus appears in the cloud brother Brown said you missed it come on people the Bible says he'll appear in the clouds the Eastern Sky how many people have you heard tell you that especially denominational people I'll be glad when that Eastern Sky parks and he walks down through there and I'm gonna go Amazing Grace how sweet to sound the same grits like me because I want to tell them yes that's not the coming you want to say that's right amen that's not the one you want to be in because this one is a secret coming at the appearing but what the sadness is people read that right there and they read a bunch of these verses that I have in scripture they might have and they're like oh man when Jesus appears well see they miss it they missed that appearing here so they're going to miss this coming like I said if you disappearing right you're going to see us coming all right now who was it whom having not seen you love and whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your soul now what is Peter telling us Peter is saying he's gone from us in a visible form where I walked with him on the shores of Galilee because if he's not saying that then let's go to John 14. John 14 then either John 14 is wrong or Peter is wrong if that's the way we take it yeah because Peter just said you don't you know you're not don't see him anymore but what Saint John 14 say which is the believer's promised land right John 14 16 says and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth and that's ongoing seeth him not they're not going to see him neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world see if me no more right visible visible they're not going to visibly see that Jesus that walked the shores of Galilee that's what Peter was talking about but Peter goes on and says I have a more sure word of Prophecy because now he's inside of me the one that talked to me is now in me that's what he's Jesus is saying here r one of the two is wrong because watch he had a little while in the world says me no more but ye see me I will appear to you Vision sight words whatever but I'm going to appear to you because why because I live you shall live also at that day the prophet said this day ye shall know that I am in my father I wish I had three cuts I am in my father he and me can't get that down in there and I and you ask how you're gonna see me right you're not going to see me separated until we get home amen now he was hidden Church ages buy this right here but ye see me now how many of us have literally seen that man and that ain't gonna be that man that's gonna be a younger man if you literally see that person you're not going to because you're his body right if he comes to this Earth with his body he breaks the word you and I are his body right he would have two bodies come on but when we come back with him we'll have a body like his glorious body we'll all be just like this right here right but yet you're going to see this right blessing it's a revelation let's turn the second Thessalonians mm-hmm two I'm sorry first Thessalonians let's read it first let's start with that I'll tell you what go to Second Thessalonians we got a minute let's read that we got time to read it because down through the church ages what happened there was a lot of loose ends the prophet said and God was hidden inside of his people but yet Satan was right there as Dad said this morning he was right there with him weaving his own weaving a web of deception to where that you couldn't tell God from the Devil right because they just he deceived them right right but now look in Thessalonians for the ministry of iniquity that's already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way and then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth what the word and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming right even him who's coming now this is the devil's coming even him who's coming is after the workings of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceivable deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie right them who's them the church body the church out there not the bride the church right now let's go to first Thessalonians because he comes down and everybody people from the from from the time Jesus left everybody's been looking for it they look for him in here in this they look for him in this and then they read the Bible just like I told you it says oh when he appears in them clouds we'll see him that's what the Bible says but if you get that appearing wrong you're going to get the coming wrong right because the devil wants you to believe that that's just coming oh did he get you off just one word remember amen he can be just as truthful as he can be but twist it one word right oh yeah let's look for his appearing like in the denominations that you know even in some of the Baptists they they show that uh and I think everybody seen the movie left behind then the movie left behind at the beginning of the movie the Raptor takes place and then there's a group of people on in the movie that get saved yeah and then the Antichrist showed up right and I told somebody I said oh man said you see that Antichrist show up in the end of the movie I said no I saw him in the first of the Moon amen because if he can get you deceived to where you say well if I don't make the rapture I can get saved in the tribulation too now that's what they think that's right so he's got him he's got him yeah he's got him whooped they see another appearing they don't see the appearing in the coming together right right to us but right here we had a prophet read this scripture I just baptized my time or sprinkled it verse 13 but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that you saw not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also went sleeping Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord so where did Paul get it from from the word of the Lord amen that we which are alive and remain unto the coming and coming of the Lord shall not prevent or hinder them which are asleep glory for the Lord himself the day I know I'm getting in your sermon a few weeks from now but I'm sorry for the Lord himself shall descend right right from heaven now all these years the denominations have said we're going somewhere to get God we're going to heaven we're going here we're going to see him in the clouds right three which one of the three amen but to me if you get a revelation his appearing shows where he is amen if you get a revelation his appearing will show exactly where he is and is and he'll he'll show you where you are now listen to this this is something I picked up right here listen to this for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout voice of the Archangel Trump of God and the dead Christ shall rise first and that's going to happen well we under yeah it's all going to happen at one time that's when the Eastern sky is going to break and that's when we're going to see the appearing of Jesus Christ that's what the devil wants you to believe the people this has already happened right this is already been fulfilled right here man it's not coming right it's here amen he's coming is here all right because when you know if you shouted and nobody heard it wouldn't do any good right and if someone vote with a voice and nobody heard it it wouldn't do any good right and somebody blew a trumpet ain't nobody heard it wouldn't do you any good right right so here's my whole point somebody must have been here to hear the shout Glory somebody must have been here to hear the voice somebody must have been here to hear the trumpet because it's not see that's the revelation of this whole scripture because you got to have somebody here to hear these things not in heaven right here right because that's where brother Brown said Jesus does all three of these as at his descending descending where right in the woods to a building to a car to the Moon where there's nobody and me and you amen you had to hear it and let it become a part of you amen the appearing God appeared to you one day in a form of a little prophet and he spoke and you heard it and you received it now a lot of people miss it because they look at brother Brown being the appearing right right that's the truth but a true Prophet I love brother Jess at his uh in Oklahoma where he said at his desk he's got a picture right here what he done was he took the the picture of brother Brown I'm indicting that you know you know when he says I ain't diet this generation he's pointing like this brother Jeff's took that picture and put that picture of him pointing but then he's got the the cloud and he said a true prophet of Christ I'm in and he's got the profit pointing not the Jesus Christ and that's a wonderful out every time I sit there I almost cry but then we which are alive and remain she'll be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so she only ever be with the Lord wherefore this word right here got to me the other day so I looked it up wherefore Comfort one another with these words Now look up the word comfort in the Greek and it translates to allowed call allowed call amen we think well for Comfort Comfort to us is Comfort Pro sister truly she's getting so old you just set up front Okay no the translation of that word Comfort is to call aloud so wherefore call aloud to one another with these words you gotta confess it before you can possess it let's stay he's now appear Ed parasito are they so much people amen you and I are his last appearing on this Earth that's why I said the appearing reveals the coming the appearing of you on Earth to get born again see this message and let God take you up through that statue of perfect man that is the coming of the Lord the way he wanted it amen amen he didn't want it in the prophets he didn't want it and the people in the Old Testament he wanted it in you and I he didn't want it just in a trumpet he wanted somebody to hear that trumpet he wanted somebody to hear that voice brother Danny he wanted somebody to see that shout to hear and then what do you want to do he wants you to shout it you know sometimes brother dick I know you look up words sometimes words is kind of and I looked at that word and I thought wherefore Comfort one another with these words and only in this day we can do that right but to call aloud to one another glory in other words don't keep it silent confess it and then possess it appearing Reveals His coming Glory I see God and this is this coming this is the coming of Lord Brothers again it's not nowhere else I'm not I'm not saying geographically to people on the table wherever I'm not saying Lula is the only place I'm saying in this message reveal amen this message made known and lived and made Manifest this is the coming of the Lord this is the shout and the voice and the trumpet this is all three together and when you see it he can appear in all kinds of forms and if he appears in the form that's not right you'll see the Antichrist amen that's what we had to do in the end time right we had to identify that Antichrist see what his work was and see how he was deceiving the people with a trinity and the father-son Holy Ghost and all these other things he was deceiving the people Born Again people he was deceiving them to believe that lie right but in the end time a little Prophet caught the appearing of God brought it to you and I and showed that it was this coming amen the appearing and the coming in this day is the same he's going to come and he's going to take us out of here and you and I when he appears once you're born again I wish you could believe this once you're born again he can't appear anywhere else show me somewhere you can appear if he's not appearing in you thank you I mean from the birth from from the New Birth he's appearing and coming and that is it I mean if you and your wife were one are you and your husband or one there's no separating right you see me thank God you see the characteristics and my wife's a lot of times are not mine but in a perfect world where Jesus Christ is perfect he takes on our sins and he says you're perfect too we don't see the little fallacies and all things that go on when we're when we get uh when we get older and can't see good I'm here good yeah but you know what though that's that's that's the type of God and us he don't see if he saw our fallacies he'd have to kill us but he don't that's why the appearing in the coming has to be together in this end time the appearing in the coming has to be together the appearing reveals is coming right let's bow ahead just a second the heavenly father we pray Lord that what was said today that you would just help it Lord just sink down in the hearts of the people father forgive us if we said anything that was wrong Lord or anything that was not not Lord pleasing to you I pray father that you would help us to take these little nuggets Lord and take them home and and Lord just stir them around in our heart father and and wait for the the bigger nuggets to come Lord from the pastor and Lord's hearing your Prophet preach and we can put these things Lord together and see that that you're coming is not as far off you're not out there where we have to go try to find you but you're nice Lord right here even the word of faith that we preach by the Forgiveness of our sins Lord and help us may you heal the sick Save The Lost in Jesus name I pray amen let's sing a song worship for a minute me too we're camping

you love his word you love his words you gotta love me because I'm in it all right now listen Wednesday brother Burley may be preaching for us Wednesday night so come and support him he he called me and said that he was coming and that some of his church members may be coming with him because they're calling off service because it's a big work to to for that camp for 125 kids plus they'll probably be about 50 adults there counselors and you know people that bring the children and all and and US there'll be you know several of us will be there but um remember that keep us in your prayers um I got to stay on them downstairs just for a second a testimony week um um Thursday morning we uh one of the owners or a couple of the owners came in and said that we were going to have a meeting with one of our customers that we get some product from and they were in so many words they were telling us that they they were their perception was that the customer was coming to to get rid of The Safaris you know and we're not doing any more product for them anymore because they had went down we went from like 400 000 pounds of product down to 100 000 pounds of product but anyway that's neither here nor there but the story is that that's what we were preparing for but we had picked up another few accounts from another place that was going to up our volume about 500 000 pounds a week and so we weren't worried about that seven loads leaving and that customer leaving because we were going to make it up double you know and so but you know I told the Lord Thursday before I went to sleep I said I just I don't like this roller coaster ride I just don't like this we are when we don't have none of this we're about to go bankrupt we're about to hire 300 people you know and I said Lauren I said you know and I never said Lord just do anything I just said Lord I'm just tired of this and I went off to sleep well about three o'clock Thursday morning popped right up out of the bed and I got thinking about that and I just said Lord I said at 99 day I said it's in your hands and he said go to sleep that's all he said go to sleep so I went to sleep next morning when I walked in the door this guy walks in and I could look at his face and I knew that he wasn't here to fire us they were there to give us 15 more loads which is 600 000 pounds of product more 150 people to hire tomorrow all right it's not we got to work seven days a week probably 60 or 70 hours huh a week there or maybe longer but that's okay but just you know I just didn't like that up and down stuff you know and Terrence knows in the chicken business it's like that it's up and down up and down but I said Lord I don't wanna I don't feel that way and they just like this piece Came Upon me you know just go sleep and as soon as that man walked through the door I could see in his face then he wasn't there to fire us he was there to give us more and he sure did and we're opening the second plant back up so uh just pray for us because this is the worst week it could have ever happened in the whole year this week was the worst week for it to happen because I'm going to have to leave Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday to go over to the youth camp and one of the owners said I couldn't go but I'm I'm not taking that I'm gonna believe that I can go because I I want to go um and I told one of the one of the guys I said look this is just like me preaching this is a Ministry for me I said and it is it's a Ministry I minister to the kids because I can't get up in front of the kids and minister to them but I can Minister what I know through you know feeding the kids and and you know talking to them and all that so just pray that that everything will go okay I mean you know God's in control but I want to read you this right here just for a second before we go and this is nothing to me but I want to try to do this maybe if Daddy will allow me see God bless you brother this is from um a sister in India said I'm keeping a watch on the side of spoken word I've enjoyed all the videos including 70 weeks you know the 70 weeks that we did here future home versus a millennium which is what we're doing down in the same school class I had to re-watch the Justified to glorify to keep Pace with what you were riding on the board as it was not very visible but I couldn't make it out I saw Pastor Dale's video as well the student the studies and sermons are such a blessing this is one Ministry that I can rely on taught me a lot and made Christ very simple Amen to justify the glorified was first preached somewhere else and daddy asked me to do it here she wants to part of the sermon that I did before so what I may do is as I was telling brother um Joe that uh if y'all bear with me and we may do it again and video it with that instead of when we videoed it over here it had a glare and you couldn't see anything on the board and that's nothing you know to me and I just like I tell you many times before I always tell the Lord I said just Lord forget me just that one person just have one person in this building or on the Internet sometimes we forget about the internet but he'll just have one person yeah you know I I don't want to go you know be some um worldwide nobody I like being right here with you guys but something like that just keeps you it makes you makes you want to get up and go to work tomorrow you know sometimes but I think we may do it again if the Lord if the Lord is uh good to us and and the pastor will give us time maybe we'll do it again and we'll do it with that camera which gets her a lot better reception and that way some of you as sister Johnny give me a big old poster board and said would you draw that I said I couldn't draw it save my life now and then Joe said well why don't you just get up here and draw it and I'll kind of impose it over the sermon that you preached I said that ain't gonna work either so I may just do it over again and may if that's okay with you guys we'll go over it again and and uh and I I just want to help people I don't care a thing about any getting anything for myself I really don't I just want to help somebody so
