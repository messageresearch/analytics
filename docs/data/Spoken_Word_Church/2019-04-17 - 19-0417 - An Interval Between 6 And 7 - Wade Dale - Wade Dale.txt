so there is something to losing weight okay all right tonight we're going to speak just for this is Wednesday night and we're just going to have a little Sunday School class and this one is entitled an interval between 6 & 7 we talked about this before but an interval between 6 & 7 this is after the six seals I hope you enjoyed the the six heal just kept opening to me I just but I just had to I had to put a stop to it maybe we'll lap back over when we get into the Seventh Seal but this will not be the sixth seal part 12 it's actually an interval and it will not be part of the sixth seal so you might want to take that off of there sometimes when you post it online but there's always something that goes on between N and interval and we'll get into some of that tonight and we'll just kind of talk and we'll go and actually get into the Bible so I've got part of it up here so you can read it but I was looking for a scripture to fit this and this scripture came to mind yeah they got it up so we'll pray and then then we'll read the scripture I hope you get something out of this tonight tell me father would pray tonight Lord that you would be with us in a special way Lord is Wednesday night all the cares of the world of a rough Monday and infused in now we are Wednesday here in the middle of service middle of the week for a service we pray this you just rejuvenate us Lord give us fresh revelation Lord let it not be just a meeting of minds let it not be that we just had to come to church just because it was Wednesday night but all we came to hear from you by the way after you forgive us of our sins Lord bless the ones that are sick among us the ones that are sick that are not with us Lord that you would bless them Lord and take care of them we know as as this part of the season that being allergy season and people are fighting those colds with pray Lord that you would just turn that back Lord and may they all be able to breathe and and and always we pray Lord for the missionaries on the foreign fields we ask you to give them fruit for their labor father lets each one now leave her brother dictum are especially Lord as he goes for the procedure that they're going to do Lord just guide the hand of the doctor be with us Lord as we travel this weekend Lord it's going to be a busy weekend with the Good Friday coming up and us honor of course we honor your resurrection every every Sunday but this is a side part we set aside Lord to honor the resurrection father we pray that you'd be with us now and bless us take care of us in Jesus name we pray amen so watch this right here that I come upon this and because we remember and we'll we'll see what an interval is because an interval is a gap or a space we'll read that in a minute and Joshua rose early in the morning now let me set this up for you this is when Moses has already died this is in Joshua 3 Moses is dead Joshua's the one that's going to take them over into the Promised Land so this is right before they go into the Promised Land right at the edge right at the river all right and Joshua rose early in the morning and they removed from chittim and came to Jordan he and all the children of Israel and lodged there before they passed over and it came to pass after three days there's your three that the officers went through the host and they commanded the people saying when you see the Ark of the Covenant now what is the Ark of the Covenant the Word of God all right it was a it was a box that looks like this box up here but it was the Word of God it contained the Word of God and he came to pass after three days that the officers went through the host and they commanded the people saying when you see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God and the priests the Levites bearing it preachers then you shall remove from your place and go after it all right get up and go in other words yet there shall be a space between you and it about two thousand cubits by measure come not near into it that you may know the way by which you must go for ye have not passed this way heretofore there's my key but let's continue reading because it's part of it too for you have not passed this way in other words leave a gap or a space because you've not traveled this way before if you get too close you may mess something up let's just give it a space or an interval of time here and Joshua said unto the people sanctify yourself we just got through the sixth seal sanctification sanctify yourself for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you he's gonna change your body and Joshua speaking to the priest saying the preachers take up the Ark of the Covenant and Passover before the people and they took up the Ark of the Covenant and went before the people now watch and the Lord said unto Joshua this day will I begin to magnify vena Joshua the type of the Holy Ghost amen that's the type of the Holy Ghost in the end time is Joshua this day will I magnify begin to magnify then the sight of all is that they may know that as I was with Moses so I will be with thee you may be seated in the Lord as a blessing to the reading world as I was with Moses so shall I be with thee in other words Moses da servant is dead the prophets gone he's off the scene so Joshua a type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost is going to take Israel into the Promised Land but he tells them as they get toward Jordan that you need to stand back or leave a space or a gap or an interval between the word and yourself you say well that doesn't that sounds strange it doesn't strange if he's never been that way before because the Levites were the one that we're carrying the art they had been that way before cuz they were out there in the water remember the Bible you keep reading when the priest stuck their foot in the water the waters parted until everybody passed over and then when the ark when the ark and when the heel of the priests come out of the Jordan it come back together hey man so Westway we're gonna go we're not going over here without a preacher and the Word of God you men and all right Louise where do we say he's in the back oh they need some help back there today so they got about six people back there it's kind of crowded yeah they got the light on now they're gonna all right so Joshua this is what I want you to see is that one where it says you have not passed this way heretofore now when we get into the Seventh Seal we're going to see tonight that there was a space between several things that happen between a six and a seven so here we are on the sixth seal and we're looking to the seventh seal and you say oh by the way we've been there before we've never been this close and been there before we've had the seventh seal preached many many times and many many brother Dale preach them in the 80s this is all the way through the seventh seal sixty-two sermons you ought to listen to amen and then but now we've come up to 2019 we're fifty-five years away from since the Prophet showed up there been a gap there's been an interval between when the profit went off the scene and when you and I are finally going to realize that we're gonna have to do the crossing over it's not going to be Moses coming back and doing all the work and crossing us over no it's the preachers with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Word of God that's gonna part Jordan and get us out of here I thought the Bible says is Ephesians said for the perfecting of the Saints he give us apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists so now let's look at this quote here and look at some of these intervals what's wrong not to be not to be but about an hour maybe pull up where it says interval there we go the word interval means the period of time between two events you have an event on this side and you have an event on this side it's the part in between and the words that are corresponding with this are a pause a gap a space remember that word space seven seals says what silence in heaven for the space of a half an hour all right pause gap space a rest because what happened to Israel when they come up to the Jordan for three days they rested sanctify yourself in other words the other part of the scripture says don't even go into your wife you need to be ready to go sanctified and ready to go across it also means breach we know brother brand preached a breach between the church ages and the seals all right it is also an interlude which means you know what an interlude is between plays when they start getting you know they have like scene number one if they have to bring everybody off the stage and put new equipment up they have an interlude they play that music that puts you to sleep right this music will shouldn't put us to sleep and man this music should wake us up because then that interval a lot of things are going on you might think sitting there looking at the curtain that there's nothing going on but behind that curtain come on people behind that curtain they're moving equipment they're bringing people in they're bringing the actors in there they're they're getting everything ready for that final act all right no preaching all right so now look let's look at the first gap or interval with Matthew 24:29 now we know this is the sixth seal all right this is Matthew 24:29 I want you though to have your Bible go to your Bible because we're gonna read this you don't have to but you just you will I would like for you to on the other ones immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the Sun be darkened moon shall not give her light now remember this is the sixth seal Jesus preached six seals Amen all right something to be darker the moon giver it won't give her light the stars shall fall from heaven we read that in what in revelations six all right for the sixth seal and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory and he shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other and they learn a parable of the fig tree now remember the sixth seal stops right here I read you the quote in just a minute the sixth seal stops here he immediately goes to a parable of the fig tree now I want you to put this in the back of your mind everywhere you see an interval or a gap the Holy Ghost is filling that gap all right there's the holy ghost is doing something to fill that gap you don't believe that watch this right remember faith is not an add you add to your faith one two three four five six an interval before the seventh seal before the headstone comes all right so the Holy Ghost is what's going to have to fill that gap in and that's what he's been doing for all these years it's been the Holy Ghost through ministers and through brothers and through all the ones that are there the Holy Ghost fill people that are what trying to get the people ready we're trying to get to Jordan we're trying to cross over it'd be you know it wouldn't have been very good if Joshua just would have just got to Jordan and said look your brother Ryan said we can't cross over no he had a commission his commission was to go into the promised land so he got everything ready and he had an interval there that he had to fill in because they had not went that way before no you and I have not went the way of the body changed before we have not this is new ground that we're trying to cover this is very new ground that we're trying to cover this is not a new revelation but it's new ground that we're trying to cover and then so right here we see end of heaven to the other that's the end of the sixth seal now learn a parable of the fig tree when the branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves you know that summer is not now what is the fig tree it's Israel what is God going to do he's going to save a hundred and forty-four thousand by the Holy Ghost he's gonna save that fig tree right there at that sixth seal we already said that because remember the six Hills with tribulation seal that's ones 144,000 will be brought out is during that six seal learn a parable then he goes all the way down so likewise when you shall see all these things know that it is new even at the doors verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only now listen this is Jesus talking everybody with me this is Jesus still preaching but that's not the Seventh Seal he preached six seals and now he's expounding on Israel but as of the days of Noah were now remember what were the days of Noah think about this the days of Noah is still a mystery to man the hundred and twenty years Noah preached was a space that no one believed what he was talking about yet it was God Almighty trying to get the people listened they'd never been that way before Noah said it's gonna rain and flood the earth the scientists said there's no water up here unbelievable it was an unbelievable 120 year message only eight people believed it out of millions why because science said and my quote book said that there's no rain up there Noah said I don't care this is the message I was given to preach you better get ready because God's gonna destroy this earth with water well as it was in the days of Noah so shall also the coming of the Son of man be that's now this is a mystery like I was talking about Sunday might we're a mystery to people we're a mystery we're not normal some of us more than others but I want to be I want to be God's not not normal but as the days of Noah were what the unbelievable message that was an unbelievable the whole world did not believe Noah except eight people seven and him I hope he believed what he was talking about well he preached it for 120 years so shall also the coming of the Son of man be so listen let me make this a little stronger most people in this message are not going to understand the message of the son of man boy everybody's quiet but you've never been this way before you've been taught hair dress and do this and don't do that and do this and don't do that God sent a prophet heal the sick raise the dead that wasn't a message of Noah the message of Noah was you better get ready because God is going to rain fire in our day on this earth and then that's the message we're preaching escape not the water escape the atomic explosion that's coming up amen where's the days that there were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage what same way today until the very day that Noah entered the Ark now remember he entered the Ark and God shut the door same way with you and I and man it's gonna be God to shut the door then shall two be in the field once you'll be taking one left two women shall be grinding at the mill once you'll be taking you know them will have watch therefore for you know not you've not been this way before for no not one hour your Lord doth come that Alright say Amen all right let's read the next clue let's read the quote there we're we're brother Branham expound on this in the seventh cell won't step down here that okay I'm gonna stayin I'm not gonna stay in front you go to shouting just let me know I'll move couldn't you remember this morning bringing these things up and watching tonight bringing them up and you find out when he gets to the Seventh Seal she cuts off just Jesus Christ is speaking himself told of the end time we just read that Matthew 24 and when he got told all six seals when he got to the seventh he stopped he stopped now remember he kept talking about the fig tree but the 6a it was over with because there's not anything spoke you know watch we're going to speak here now on the seventh chapter just a minute kind of bridge it between interval sixth and seventh seal because that's the only material we have to go on right now is this between the sixth and seventh seal is the calling out of Israel in other words the Holy Ghost is on the same okay bye all right with that say man because Jesus was the seventh seal he couldn't preach anything about the seventh seal that's why the seventh seal silence it's him it's a person that's what we're looking for we're looking for a person we're not looking for a piece of paper we're looking for a person God living in you like we were talking about let me let me just make that I have some comments on this I'm gonna read them again brother Brown said in Patmos vision what happens when to omnipotence meet when God and man comes together to run impotent something's got to shake yeah you don't have these clothes you you got it from like Sunday whose whatsoever you'd say with that creative power of omnipotence of God knowing that he's promised it and he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out younger and brings things to pass that's what we're looking at that's what we're looking at we're looking at the power going out and creating things limbs can be restored all these different things we can we can look forward to but you know I read a commentary this week and it made a lot of sense God is not omnipotent to the degree that he's all-powerful period come on yeah thanks Frieda seats come on Brother come on brother remember he wants everybody to be safe now an all-powerful we would think would just say I'm will save everybody but he can't go past this word he's omnipotent as far as his word goes because he would that all be saving them does not stand a person will lose all these people no he wished that everybody would be saved so being all-powerful I'd save everybody but he's not because his word says they certain things you got to do remember there's promises that he made and being omnipotent he has to be omnipotent toward his word will show to you you're not all-powerful in the sense that you can do anything you want to you're all powerful because the word gives you that gives you that responsibility whatsoever you say to that creative power of omnipotence of God that's where you get it from so that's why brother Brown said power without character is sought Anik you have that power but you if you have that power and you don't have the character you can do a lot of damage look at Elijah now I sure didn't have the new birth but look at Eli sure God honored that prophet so much till he got mad one day call to she-bears date 42 children that was power without character he said well that satanic without look God didn't kill them babies but he honored that prophets word because he put that prophet in the position same way your brother branham he put but now remember he put brother Branham in that same position remember the two kids making love in them he had power to turn them dead he said what remember the Holy Ghost said whatever you say what did he say I forgive you I forgive you he had that power but he had character to go along with it and he said I forgive you for that amen what an example we had all right now look let's pull this bait now let's go so we see Jesus preached six sealed say right there when Jesus preached six seals and then he started talking about the parable the fig tree well he was the seventh seal so there's nothing else to to come that's all there's this just it's just Christ alright but now what about if it's Christ in you the hope of glory then does that not make you part of the seal now look revelation 6 and there in your Bible revelation 6 we just finished this but watch and I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake Sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when he's shaken of a mighty wind and heaven departed as a scroll when it rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of their place and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich man - chief captains mighty men and every bondman ever Freeman hid themselves I need some oxygen hid themselves in the dens and interrupts of mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us with the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb was a great day of wrath has come who shall be able to stand now that's the end of the sixth seal in revelations chapter 6 right that's six seals with Revelation chapter 6 now Revelation 7:1 begins like this and after these things there's a gap you don't pick the seventh seal up until revelations 8:1 think about 8:1 he put the seventh seal in the eighth chapter something in there but now he the six seals and then revelation seven he entered Jax this right here and after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds that the wind should not blow and every mill that's Wars blowing the earth nor on the sea nor any tree and I saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal the Living God and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea saying hurt not the earth nor the sea till we have sealed the servants now brother branham watch that servants that's not us that's not us so the sixth seal when you see revelation seven it goes right back to Israel to that 144,000 by the baptism of the Holy Ghost is going to receive a seal till we have sealed the servants we're not servant we're bride Israel its servants so look out with continuity the Bible six seals gap interval and now I said I've heard the number of them which were sealed you're gonna this is going to prove it and they were sealed 144,000 of all the tribes of the children of Israel then I didn't put all that there's a whole bunch of the chapter down through there but now go to the next one the next thing is revelations 8:1 and we had opened the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven about the space of a half an hour because remember let me interject this let me let me interject this in just for a minute when we come to a sixth seal sanctification Christ has to come on the scene it makes him come on the scene in us when Israel gets their sixth seal sanctification the Bible says according to Daniel that Christ comes and fights for Israel he shows up on the scene to Israel through to witness is not not Berta not physically but remember they preach him so much till they say where did you get the scars and the wounds and all those things right and he said in the house of my friends all right so after six seals Christ always shows up but he shows up in the form of the holy ghost in that interval and they all right without hope was not born you some of you some of you could just be a statue but you know what if this don't stir your soul yeah spoons fell out your bow or your shovels fell out of your ditch or whatever we thrown about I like shovel cuz it's bigger okay anyhow and we had opened the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven about space for half an hour nothing nothing went on but it is in Revelations 8:1 now let's read what the Prophet says when the seventh seal now we notice we notice this being just one verse here we'd like to do something just a little bit before here if you notice we skip the seventh chapter now this is on this this is on the seventh seal alright he's preaching the seventh seal if you know it good thank you if you notice we skip the seventh chapter the sixth chapter ends up the sixth sixth seal but between the sixth seal and the seventh seal there something takes place and how lovely that's placed just at its right place between six and seven chapter now if you notice in the seventh chapter we notice between the sixth and seventh there's an interval an interval between the sixth and seventh chapter of the Book of Revelations and it's between the sixth and seventh seal that this interval is given notice we want to notice this very important that we noticed this little time alright this little time was a time that Israel's brought in but now you and I still you got to remember well this has nothing to do with us we're gone no let me tell you something right now you're in an interval you are in a space of time that we are between time and time shall be no longer we're standing at revelations 10 1 through 7 we're standing in that place or that gap right now it's been 55 years since the Prophet left the same something's got to happen amen Noah preached 120 years we're almost halfway there from 120 you got 55 years since the Prophet left I mean come on people we should already Howard you believe five years ago amen all right we okay let's go the next quote still on the Seventh Seal now if you notice in the seventh chapter we noticed between the sixth and seventh there's an interval an interval between the sixth and seventh chapter of the Book of Revelations and it's between the sixth and seventh seal that's this interval is given now we want to notice this this is a redo but I'll add to this part down here very important that we noticed this little time now and we notice this interval now between the sixth and seventh chapter now the seventh chapter of Revelation reveals a happening it's not here just for nothing it's not put in between this for that none of this is put in between anything we're gonna look where brother round did some things and stopped and then did some thing we're gonna stay still in the Bible you got the trumpets you got the vowels all uc6 there's a gap in seven all right but something did happen in that gap all right mm-hmm it's here for a purpose here for a purpose and it's a revelation that reveals something what that the Holy Ghost is on it the scene more prevalent than any other time because we've squeezed him into a gap and then if you let water just flow down a big wide stream you know you go to the Chattahoochee River down below Atlanta and that thing's about 300 feet wide and it just looks like this but when you go up here where we're fishing huh and it's about this wide going through them rocks it's a rushing mighty water and then so that's what we've come to why because it's been squeezed in you and I have this is the place we've been squeezed in this is the gap we're either gonna cross over or we're gonna stay on this side now how mysterious and how mathematical it fits right in the scripture exactly you believe in God's mathematics if you don't you're sure lost in the you'll sure get lost in the word if you start putting a four or six or something besides just a mathematical word running an order you'll sure have and you're seeing a count picking grass on top of a tree somewhere your shirt you'll certainly run out because God does not his whole word does not run completely in mathematics it does run completely in mathematics sorry yes sir perfect the most perfect there's no other literature written like it like it's so perfect in mathematics now the eighth chapter only reveals the scene I want you to keep that in your mind it reveals the scene of the seventh seal remember I was talking about acts of a play you got one Act one Church age then the curtain falls then yeah they take that equipment off when they bring another piece of equipment in then they had open the thing there's an interval all right well you and I are in the interval we're not between the six and seven Church age but we're between standing in the seventh church age and eternity now look nothing where nothing else is revealed nothing is not revealed in the seventh seal now has nothing to do with the seventh chapter revelations it's the revealing of the seventh seal is perfectly mute and we're gonna get into that when we get into the Seventh Seal if I only had time I'll try in a few places to show you all the way back from Genesis this seventh chapter of this Seventh Seal is spoke up from the very beginning in Genesis those seals moved right up if you've never heard that sermon preached you need to listen to one brother Dale preaches on the seals in the book of Genesis because I'll guarantee you it takes you right back to the first of Genesis and put so seals right in order and man because what the seals are the Word of God folks it's not something that's not written amen so now you got six seals then you've got an interval where you bring Israel in then you got the seventh seal now you and I are not here in time when that let me slow down a minute we are not here in time when that happens we've been through this and through this we twelve sermon we're not here when 144,000 are saved when nine 44,000 are saved we are not here we are over in another dimension at the wedding supper while God brings tribulation on the earth they men while he does his three-part thing he what he purchased the he purchased the 144,000 he purchased the foolish virgin and he purchased the earth because then we're gone then we come back onto the earth for the Millennium thereby got that say man all right we've had we've been talking about the whole thing the six seals the Tribulation Period we are not here during that time but you and I are under now a sixth seal purging of what's in you we're all under that we got us to have a sixth seal purging the most the greatest purging there ever was that'll purge your old self out and what you'll stand is a 20-year old person and all the older ones said and all the younger ones said maybe that's why God let us get older that we'd appreciate the body changed a lot more and then at 20 years old you're just gonna be twenty years old but if you're 79 and close behind way in front district leader back there in the back she acts like she's 20 already out walk any of us I'm promise you that but we have a scene here at the eighth chapter brings the seventh ceiling we're gonna get to talking that but there is an interval a gap between the sixth seal and the Seventh Seal thereby all right with that all right now let's go and move on - I just want kind of hit the highlights no maybe we'll hit it again so we don't not so long tonight now let's go and move to the trumpets now pull these up for you but I've got them in my Bible and I saw this a long time ago and I marked it all in the Bible and you can mark it in if you want to revelations chapter 9 now remember all trumpets sound under the sixth seal so those trumpets listen to me watch look at me all trumpets sound on the sixth seal that is to Israel they get you and I have the Feast of the trumpets but they are under one two three four five six seven trumpets all right and the seven trumpets are as the seven seals are to us right amen everybody got that time we read your quote in a minute where brother Brown said their Seventh Seal in ours I mean their seventh trumpet and our seventh seal same thing all right and we're going to read it so here we got revelations 9 verse 13 because remember listen hold on just second I forgot to bring this into wrote myself a note and a lobster nope but remember God dealt with Israel in the Old Testament right God dealt with Israel in the Old Testament let me see if I'm fine my my scripture here and Isaiah 54 6 listen to list it's not up here but you just listen Isaiah 54 6 through 8 I just found this a few minutes ago I wanted something else to tie this together and while I'm talking if they want to bring it up see if you can find it brother Anderson Isaiah 54 6 I want you to read this now remember God put everything he had on Israel in the Old Testament then he had to put him away there was an interval of 7 Church ages before he started dealing with Israel again and then so see if he can put that up I was there 54 6 but the Lord have called thee as a woman Forsaken and grieved in spirit and a wife of youth when thou was refused saith the Lord Isaiah 54 7-4 a small moment gap interval space of time for a small interval how about forsaken thee but with great mercy will I gather thee in a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee saith the Lord thy Redeemer and man that's what a bit I was looking for because God he didn't forget him but he said I forsaken thee for a small moment what he forsaken them at the cross they forsake him first forsook him first right he had to put her away in marriage Gentile bride but he didn't forget Israel he can't they can't be his wife again but he can't forsake them but with great mercy will I gather they watch what's he doing nice gathering them in so there was an interval between Christ on the cross and when we get out of here there's a gap of time in there that God's not dealing with Israel God's not dealing with there's one else a nation individuals yes nation no he will not deal with it was an end of it of the nation till we leave then what's he gonna do he's gonna show up at the end of that sick sale he's gonna show up and fight for Israel that's what the Bible says that all right somebody you're looking a little cross-eyed study your Bible but that's the truth as I'm reading it from the Bible okay argue with it wrote it I'm just reading it so the trumpets let's go back to the trumpets now revelations now because all the trumpets are to Israel one two three four five six seven and the sixth angel sounded I just put took a piece of this to save for time and the sixth angel sounded and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God saying to the sixth angel the sixth trumpet which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are bound in the river Euphrates there's your war Winsor war he's loosing all the war well I like the six seal if the sixth seal and the six trumpets the same thing if the six seals the tribulation and the purging of Israel so with the six angel that blowed the trumpet loose four angels which are bound in the river Euphrates and then so now you would say now the next thing what happened would be is the seventh angel would sound no there's an interval and what is that interval I hope you know this one revelations 10 and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow upon his head and his face was it were son Peters pillars of fire we know all that's it happened in Revelations 10 there in that interval between 6 and 7 there's a prophet interjected in there amen revelations 10 7 and in the days of the voice of the seventh angel now that's not the seventh angel they blow the trumpet no no no no no because he's going to show up a little bit later but this is the special revelations 10:1 because listen we say well you say well brother way this is all to the bride remember we're not here that's the Israel they're gonna get a mighty angel they're gonna get Christ he's gonna come down you don't believe that go to the Book of Daniel the Book of Daniel it tells the same man plus one for the wind one foot on sea and he swears by time time and a half because they get a time time times and a dividing of times let me read that right amen same man though same angel they don't get a different Christ then we get when Christ comes back to them he comes back as the mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow upon his head and you remember all those things happen so now remember during that interval God sends something but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God to be finished that's what turns them that's what turns them to the mighty angel that's what turns us to the mighty angel they man not brother branham's the mighty angel because remember John takes the bulk from that mighty angel he doesn't take the book from the set of church age messenger huh I'll prove it to you you just keep reading John took the book from that mighty angel and brother bran said who is that only Christ could that be and you see how God hid that because you know what if I was writing the Bible that'd be a big a but God hid it in simplicity and made it a little a and it took a little profit in the end time to say that's Christ because he's got the same characteristics as over in Revelation chapter 1 so he could put them right together alright so they're in Revelations 10 there's an interjection between the sixth trumpet and the seventh trumpet Christ comes and brings a message to me and you but Christ also comes and takes the message to Israel amen because look revelations 1116 and the seventh angel sounded now this is not brother Branham this is not the seventh messenger this is the seventh angel sounded the trumpet and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ and he shall reign forever and ever and the four and twenty elders which set before God on their seats fell upon their faces and worshipped God saying we give thee thanks O Lord God Almighty who art and wast and art to come now that's the son of man because thou has taken to thee thy great power and have reign the prophet of God said to seventh seal and the seventh trumpet it's the same thing that's what Israel gets the seven seals what we get we get Christ but we get the same thing listen when the seventh seal has been open to you the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ and he shall reign forever and ever what through you and four and twenty elders which set before God on their seats what's the twenty-four elders twelve apostles twelve patriarchs that's everybody in the Bible twelve in the Old Testament twelve and a new alright so you got the whole Bible standing there which sat before God on their seats fell upon their faces and worshipped God saying we give thee thanks O Lord God Almighty which art and wast and art to come because thou has taken to thee thy great power and that's rain and then they're okay with that say man so the revelations 9 was the sixth trumpet revelations Tim was interjected where Christ comes by the Holy Ghost through a prophet brings us a message by the Holy Ghost brings the message to Israel through two prophets and then that sounds because look folks this is millennium this is the millennium all the world powers are done away with in that interval the Battle of Armageddon all the forces are gone then when we come back in the Millennium this is what's going to happen the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord he's going to sell on his throne as the son of David and rule and reign over the whole world but you know what hidden in simplicity and hidden in between the lines in a love letter is you and I hey man that's where the love letter is we can read that all day if you don't have a revelation of who you are you'll think that's talking about somebody else but it's talking about you and me I told you folks you and I are the mystery of this whole thing Satan can't believe that that's us hidden in there somewhere and simplicity no by all rights Amen all right let's read number four we're doing good I'll be out of here in a minute now Feast of the trumpets now you'll have to really we're gonna slow down here just a second because brother branham brings out some things in the Feast of the trumpets people said he made a lot of mistakes but he did not you just not listening to what he said I said you I mean us we're just not listening to what he said there were three stages of it as I said now what's he talking about he's talking about Church ages yeah I'm sorry they talk about the church ages the martyrs the age of the martyr for it then the stage of the reformers who Luther and Wesley come up to Pentecost and now now the calling out time that's what it is now now brother Browns message called out a group of people amen and when finished at Laodicean age according to revelations 10 the mystery of all the Bible would be no to the bride not one person to the bride is that right congregation says all right revelations 10 listen close now huh huh bride called out by the word Christ himself calling out the bride making plain Hebrews 13:8 that he's the same yesterday today and forever the I am does the same is the same he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also why do you tie that in huh Luke 22 or Luke 17 30 and also Malachi 4 Hebrews 4 and 12 whoa all these scriptures this promise this is to be between the sixth and seventh seal and the sixth and seventh trumpet neighs exactly right so that's how I just proved it to you he's calling out of people but through the message that goes to the two prophets of number five Elijah they're gonna call out a group of people all right and you know what they're gonna say Hebrews 13:8 you got to remember listen just for one second those people in Israel right now do not read now they may read the New Testament as they commentary but they don't think that's the Word of God right the Orthodox Jew now they can tell you everything it says in the Torah and all the old prophets but now this New Testament thing but what's God's going to turn them from what God turned you from an old message to a new message memory turn to hearts heart other children look back to the Pentecostal father's pentecost feast now remember you and i listen you and i have been celebrating since the day of pentecost we've already been through this and we'll go through one more time the day of pentecost fell 8030 we have been under a Pentecostal feast from then until now but now you'll also hear brother Branham tell you that we're under the feast of what Tabernacles because that is the last feast of the ingathering were you set in a booth okay all right everybody get that all right chewing a little bit Pentecost feast finishes at the period of the seventh trumpet for the next is the coming the seventh seal for the next is the mystery of the coming of Christ all right Pentecost feast finishes at the period of the seventh trumpet for the next is the coming the seventh seal for the next is comes remember what is the seventh seal look we'll read it the seventh seal to come to the Lord the end of all things the end to the struggling the world will read all these ends that it's the end up but the seven seals are coming of Christ six seals finishes Redemption seventh seal brings you back to earth we'll read that in a minute all right I think I got it or a male lifted the seventh seal for the next is to the mystery of the coming of rocks now what's the mystery of the coming across you you're the mystery of the coming Christ everybody's looking for Christ to come through the clouds I talked to a guy listen hi he stood right in front of me he said I'll be so glad when God flirts the eastern sky and he just comes walking right down on this earth I looked at him and I said I won't call his name I said according to my Bible you missed it you don't want to be here when that coming is told the whole world's gonna see I go back to the thief and the night that's when he's gonna come and get us he's gonna get us as the thief in the night we're not gonna see apart these from Sky come walking down through if we do that we've missed it but if that happens we're with him for the next is a mystery of the caisson he will not leave his bride she's always with him and also the trumpet is sound for the Jews God's gonna sound the trumpet to the Jews while they're on earth get the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right between the six and seven then the seventh is that we're gonna all be in the Millennium right I just read that their sixth trumpet is sound and when it does it makes known to them the reveal son of God now what is their sixth trumpet same as the sixth seal tribulation period to the world but the sounding of that trumpet is through two prophets to reveal Christ to the 144,000 thereby all right with that all right there are six trumpet is sound and when it does it makes known to them the revealed Son of God see they don't get a revelation of son of man they get a revelation son of God because that's what was a revelation down through the seven church ages except for right there at the very end where brother Dale has been preaching right here we get what you and our garden human flesh and the word was made flesh and what among listen I wouldn't be preaching in front of you people if I didn't know the word wasn't fleshing somebody it would be a mute point moot point it would be definitely silence sometimes it's that way anyway it makes notes on them the reveal son of God one half-hour of space he brings that so close to that seventh seal remember all trumpets sound on this sixth seal the sixth seal finishes the mystery the sixth seal when it breaks to us redemption is over you'll get a body change because seven is going to step on the scene and when the seventh seal steps on the scene it's that mighty angel its Christ and he's not a second person he's you she is him I said the seventh seal is a person I didn't tell you it was yet not yet the sixth seal finishes the mystery the sixth trumpet when it sounds to Israel it's finished their mystery okay under the sixth seal just before the seventh is open now there's where a lot of people get the quote that the Seventh Seal hadn't open yet well then we just do away with Christ okay remember God does it reveals it and then makes it manifest you got to go through those three things does it reveals it makes it manifest you know what he does it he opened it when the Prophet opened it that night on the seventh seal he opened the seal does it it took 55 years for somebody to get it reveals it and then those people are going to make it manifest I'll promise you it will not be thus saith the Lord it will be you say to the mountain it will be you say to the squirrel you say to the porkchop you say to the drink you need you say to the gas in the gas can but remember power with characters fit to rule you'll know what to do with it when he comes we get these seals right people and then we're in position for that thing to break Joshua had to get Israel together if you'll continue reading Joshua three and four and up two and three and four he had to get those people together get him ready and then he said let them priests going out a little bit further because y'all never been this way before let then in other words let them preachers go out there and get it and then fill that gap in hey man we had a prophet in the end time he went right to that future home he went right to that future home preached us right to the future home but he had to go off the scene you know why because we kept looking to him not to Christ just where it is because remember it's not one person this is not a one person message it used to be it's not anymore it's a Brydon message amen where was a number four that number four yes all right let's go to number five continuation feast of the trumpets oh god how can we say this to make the people see it now brother Branham has got a revelation he's fixing to tell people but you don't know how to say it that's what he just said Oh God how can we say this to make the people see it it's between this sixth trumpet and the sixth trumpet and sixth trumpet and the seventh seal sounds at the same time I just told you that six trumpeting the sixth seal same thing and between the sixth trumpet and the seventh trumpet there's a prophet that appears before the Gentiles that's revelations 10 we just I just told you that all right to call the people back to the original Pentecostal doctrine and the to witness of revelations 11 appear to the Jews same gap that's why I said revelations 10 is not only to us if to Israel they get a message that turns our heart back to call the people back to the original Pentecostal doctrine so what's the two witnesses going to do same thing they're gonna turn back to say hey you missed it at Pentecost right the Jews missed it as a nation at Pentecost and those two witnesses of revelations eleven appeared to the Jews to send them to Jesus while the church is being taken up all of them profits what one prophet to us two prophets to Israel the word of the Lord cannot be broken it won't be a denomination do you see it read in your book here and see if that between the 6th and 7th trumpet isn't interjected in there let the Jews being called out between the 6th and 7th played now he might he made a mistake that's not at the plague that's the 6th and 7th trumpet we come over to that 144,000 because that's where they were called out from which was between that do you remember between the 6 the 5th seal in the 6th seal he stops between the 6th and he's like me he's trying to get in hurry between the 6th and the 7th seal there was a calling out remember when we stopped at the 6th seal that was a fig tree all right when we stopped at the 6th seal two prophets come on the scene in Revelations calling out 144,000 you remember that now there is where these trumpets come in right here say in persecution and horses loosed on them remember brother Branham thought he needed to preach all seven trumpets remember he was going to he said we'll get a building we're gonna try to do it he said now I know why he said cuz God spoke to me and said you preached them already supernaturally in the sixth seal and they're not even to us except for spiritual application they're to the Jews because the the trumpets have always been to the Jews they've always gathered under their trumpet but you and I get a message everybody with that say man that goodwill okay we got an instrument in that interval is a gap a space but something's going on during that time today let's go to the bowels revelation 16 we'll be done in just second revelation 16 verse 12 through 17 and the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates and the water thereof was dried up that the way of the kings of the East must be prepared that's the six vial stop and I saw three nine three unclean spirits like frogs come out you and I would think that was a continuous reading but I'm a reed where brother Bram stopped it because this is the this is the interval between the sixth angel poured out this vial and the seventh angel and I saw three unclean spirits like frogs you know what brother Brown would read what he said that was come out of the mouth you said brother that brother down what's this got to do with Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost revealed who those were there was a revelation how in the world meeting you read I saw three unclean spirits like frogs how in the world would we know that was a water baptism in the name of the Father Son Holy go our Trinitarian or Trinitarian frog it took a prophet because you stopped the sixth angel poured out his vial and I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the Beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet for they are the spirits of devils now hmm we're all home folks here if there was a denominational person sitting in here today they've never read that like we read it never have they read that's their Trinitarian doctrine hey man never have they read that and don't try to convert them by reading that at first let them read it for they are the spirits of Devil's working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world this whole world is deceived by the water baptism and by the Trinity this whole world is deceived and if you and I don't believe that you're God and not another person you're deceived Wow why would you not want we lived all this time while we fought all these battles to not know that God's here doing the work but he's doing it through us a man for they're the spirits of Devil's working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the Battle of that great day of God Almighty we know what that is behold I come as a thief now here it is this behold I come as a thief blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame and he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon now remember between the sixth seal sixth trumpet and the seventh seal on the seventh trumpet there's tribulation right six seals tribulation then it just pours right over into a battle well that's the same thing with the vowels it's it's going from six flowing around and what is the Battle of it's the Battle of that old doctrine I'll read it to you and to gather them together in a place called Hebrew tongue Armageddon there's your interval then and the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air and there came a great voice out of the Temple of Heaven from the throne saying it is done it is finished it is over it is the end it is the seventh seal it has been reproduced Christ has been reproduced on this earth and then so there's your gap now let's read what brother Brown said about that northern ones at the end time now notice here's something real quick while we're ending with our talk me too now notice revelation 16 13 to 14 if you want to put that down I don't have time maybe to go to it I want you to be sure and see it now notice this is sounding between the sixth and seventh vial he's going to show us what happened in the interval now we'll close out just in a minute if you can just bear a few minutes longer closing out now know revelation 16:13 2:14 between the 6th and 7th pile three unclean spirits like frogs did you notice that went out of the mouths of someone now notice quickly are you ready say man a trinity of spirits in Trinitarians were going trying to slide down in the seat because who was he talking to 90% of them were Trinitarians and this was in jeffersonville so they were there too you know now denominational brother sit still just a minute don't get up and walk out of the room back there on this radio telephone hookup don't turn your tape recorder off that still just a minute listen you're born of God you will roll on the a Trinity of frogs a frog is an animal that always looks backward it never looks where he's going he looks where he's come from see don't you see where was trinitarianism born remember three unclean spirits individual spirits are you getting it congregation says notice they look back to the Nicene Council where the Trinity doctrine was born out not in the Bible there's no such a thing they look back to the Nicene council it and i see a room where the trinity was born notice where they came from notice and the Trinity of frogs came out of an old Trinity gave birth to a new trinity their mother what had come out of a Trinity the Dragons see the beast and the false prophet a trinity knew and if you don't be careful you're gonna get caught in that interval and you're gonna make a trinity your God Almighty and human flesh that makes you one with God not one with three I could say something a lot stronger but I'm not going to we can't interject somebody else in there either it's you and Christ alone and that's it the man don't make a new Trinity look what it is it's false but when there were these frogs come out when did it notice they was there all the time but it wasn't manifested until between the 6th and 7th file just before the seals open to revealing amen that all right the Holy Ghost had to come on the scene through a prophet and reveal in that interval what that doctrine is that's what I'm saying to you tonight in that interval that we're in right now all false doctrine has to be done away with doesn't matter what you think what I think all false doctrine has to be done away with you cannot take a body change until you get all false doctrine out of the way all right just for a few things right here and then we'll then we'll close go to the next little I kind of pulled these up if you ever thought of this brother branham preaches individual church ages he preaches one two three four five six now this is not the book the church age book this is the actual messages he preaches to the sixth church age and he has an interval he stops and preaches what 10 virgins and the hundred and forty four thousand I thought that's when they were called right now not between the six seven church age but the Secret Service seal they're called out now but but he stopped preached ten virgins then the next night he preached this one not this one not in this one not now what do you do with the sixth seal come down preach one two three four five six had questions and answers then that night he preached the Seventh Seal there was an interval and right in this interval let me tell you something about in this interval right here he found out a lot of things he found out then people wasn't getting what he's doing about you're not getting it it's not for you go on as you are live a good simple Christian life it's already gone from you that's why there was a brother called me and dad was talking about it that's why on this seventh seal remember and I'm not saying this with no disrespect to brother Branham but he really was trying to fill out something remember he preached the seventh sealing and he went back and retyped it the next day somebody all know that he preached the seventh with senior book he preached the seventh seal preached the whole entire thing then you look down at the bottom and they put this little thing in says brother Branham the next day had the brothers come back into a motel room right brother leg you know you remember that and come back into the motel room and he reap reached a section of the Seventh Seal he wasn't satisfied with it or he wasn't to reap reached it again amen why but I'll tell you why because he got off frustrated because nobody was paying attention to it he was a human but how can you not be a human and think that none of the congregation of six seven eight hundred people sitting in front of him was getting anything he said the whole week even in the sixth seal he said I was hoping and waiting for someone to stand up and say I see it and they haven't done it why because when he come to questions and answers he said oh I want his questions on the seals all he got was should women wear pants to bed pajamas two or three times about the Trinity two or three times about water baptism should we do this and are you gonna have a healing service there was only about two questions of the whole thing about the seals and they weren't anything very deep so he knew then when he come to them questions he read them that night he read them that night he'd come in that next morning then we sit he stood there he said he's going from you and you know what I do I believe that angel told him that because how could brother Branham say how could brother Branham say it's gone from you it's not for you unless he had a revelation that it wasn't for them so he preached the seventh so he preached the seals and and nobody got it you and I are gonna get it cuz you and I have the right crystal we have the right receptor to get it we've had fifty five years of honing this thing down to where we can get it but in that we're in that interval my folks my brother's my sisters we're in an interval we're in a gap or a space what we've never been before we've never been this close to the coming of the Lord never been this close to a revelation of the seventh seal and what it is they just not let my people they made the seventh seal polygamy amen they've made it seven thunders they made it two Lords they made it two souls they made it everything in the world except Christ in you the hope of glory the simplest revelation you'll ever get will be have a foundation of a city seals that we've been preaching for over a year on now tried to break it down the best I know how to break it down even more than brother Dale not higher than him no way but broke it down a little bit longer more than sixty two sermons that's for sure but tried to break it down so that now that we've come to this place and Joshua's getting ready to take us over the Holy Ghost is getting ready to say hey we've been around this mountain long enough it's time to what go on and do what we said we're gonna do everybody everybody get in one place Joshua get in one place put the ark what what he just would do Joshua did exactly exactly what he should have done he put the word first he put the word first then he said stand back about a thousand meters because you've never been this way before but as they walk you keep walking with them and then now you've been that way before and then when you get into the Promised Land it's not such a strange thing because you and I when you got the new Burke you've got part of the Promised Land but remember when Joshua puts them in the Promised Land they didn't just lay back get in the hammock and start eating grapes they fought for every inch of ground but they won all them Heights they fought every ight and they got their position you and I gotta fight for every position we got to fight every itthere is Jeb besides have us here times and websites Lula's and that's right and brando mites we got to fight all that because it's Christ in you the hope of glory here won't be any other way it won't be a famous preacher gonna stand up and tell you something you've never heard before no now you say well yeah you've said some things I've never heard before well you know what if you disbelieve them you better start praying if you believe them they've already they've laid dormant in there you've read them sister Julie she's not here tonight but she told me she said there's no telling how many times I've read that sermons where he talks about to omnipotence cuz ones in the Patmos vision we've read the church age book 500 times okay 400 but we read the church age book all of our life how many times did you read that where brother Browne said in the pomace vision when to omnipotence meet but what it is listen how many times we read the Bible and you go today out of chapter really how many times you read the Bible and go I just read that last week or not how many times you had a preacher come up and read your quote or read your script you go I just read that last week you know what there's a time and a place for everything to be revealed it's not gonna be revealed all at one time God's not going dumping on us because we can't take it but he's gonna give you a little bit and you know what he's gonna hold that for a little while so that you'll get this part around it and then he's gonna open it up and you're gonna take that and you're gonna keep eating it in because John ate the whole book he didn't leave two or three pages out he ate the whole book he ate it like that old brother said from cover to cover let's stand our feet god bless you we're in an interval and it's not an interval but we're sitting around not doing nothing no gods won't list the cross over and I believe we put the word first I believe we put the word first and even in that interval because the word goes remember God's always in motion God's always moving and the people that got left behind us the people that quit moving musicians come on the people that quit moving listen Luther had a message Wesley had a message the Baptist had a message that's reading this other day but what happened was they cabbage down in other words stopped if you don't know that southern word cabbage down they stopped and said this is it and then God said no it's not come come come come follow me mm-hm cuz that's what would have happened if you take the Ark of the Covenant with the priests here stands Joshua top of the Holy Ghost he's their leader and he said okay follow that arc and a couple of and a couple of tribes go I think we're gonna go this way see that's what we've been you were not following the word with that well that looks better cuz it looks more shallow over that way oh I said shallow didn't it that looks like it I didn't mean that really didn't that shallow over there let's go over there cuz it's easy we don't have to think so much no I think I remember one time when the Bible number when the guy walked out in the water to his knees then he got to his loins then he got to his chest and then it was water to swim in that's the water I want to be cuz you know what God's not gonna let you drown I promise you that amen you love the Lord but we're in that interval we're in that gap or that space of time that we're right at the verge of the seventh seal becoming open to it and not just preaching the seventh seal but it's kind of come open to you a personal something a personal revelation every seal first seal second seal third fourth fifth and six should be a like we were talking Sunday justification sanctification and baptism Holy Ghost just in a higher form roll with God rolling on God rolling on bringing it more and more let's sing a song let's worship just a minute blessed assurance Jesus is mine oh what a foretaste of glory divine

through all that he's he's the high priest that's been touched by the feeling of our infirmities well my infirmity is a grave that's the big infirmity you know you can say I feel bad but hey you're most of us all of us are heading toward the grave we're born to die until what until we come to place we've never been before not a new thought or some new doctrine or some new idea don't get that in your head it's not that it's something we've already just like I read when to omnipotence meet how many times that we read that in the message and just read right over the top of it but he's talking about two all-powerful beings meet together listen before the fall when God got together with Adam talk about all-powerful tell me what Adam couldn't do except create but now listen once we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost once we come to the great third Pole let there be let there be let there be we had a little profit in the end time he'd give us some training he trained us you show that was just for brother branham disagree he didn't leave and take everything with him he left and give us everything that we needed to get us out of here and it's right here it lies in these books and tapes what brother Branham said we just got to get in them dig them out and then not bring our own revelation but bring a true revelation from God and that'll change our body it won't be something you gotta scrub you update fifteen showers you got to change and put something no it's all gonna come from inside it's what you pack in God's gonna quicken what you packed in that's what he'll do listen God can't quicken something you don't have inside but he will quicken what you've held inside of you so you got to here remember faith doesn't come by preaching they doesn't come by speaking faith comes by hearing but somebody's got to speak and you hear I told them the other day I told y'all I somebody told me that the Bible said this in a different way but I came up with the phrase that that it is a heart it's hard to learn with your mouth open and I told brother rush that and he said that's somewhere in the Bible and he looked it up and he said biddings act like that but it's somewhere somewhere in the Old Testament he they talked about that but yeah it's hard to learn with your mouth open two ears one mouth somebody's got to be the one in my somebody got to be the one who stands up here because you know what that's what the Bible said the Bible said for the perfecting of me and you we need a fivefold ministry and I believe we've got a good one take care this weekend there's gonna be a lot of traffic on the road you may be traveling we're gonna be traveling but if you're here this is your church home you come here expecting a resurrection on Sunday we'll be back Monday lord willing and just keep us in your prayers so all minds clear let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for this time period that we have just to bring a few things Lord for your people that they may as John did chew on this and digest it and let it become part of them father we're standing truly at an interval we're standing at a place we've never been before and we pray Lord that we'll meet the challenge you've give us the equipment you give us the whole armour of God you sent a little prophet to give us 1,100 sermons that come straight from you and Lord I believe now it's been distributed out to a fivefold ministry and they're bringing it to the people and if we can bring it Lord clear and unadulterated Lord they will be a body change it will happen because it's already been spoken probably just be with us take care of us on the highways on the way home be with each one father until we meet again name of Jesus Christ we pray these things remember brother dick
