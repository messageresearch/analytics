good morning God bless you each one say happy Mother's Day to all the moms this morning and so um got called upon to do the Sunday School lesson this morning so before we uh before we start let's just pray Heavenly Father we thank you for this day Lord we thank you for all your blessings on us and we just pray this morning Lord Jesus that we look unto you for all things this morning we just pray that you bless the Sunday School lesson Lord bless the ones Sunday school lessons downstairs bless brother Bob he brings the word this morning Lord Jesus Lord we just pray that we commit ourselves to you Lord draw closer to you Lord we would just want to be what you'd have us be Lord we thank you for all things we commit all things in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen so this morning I the blessings of a mother and uh Proverbs 1 got two scripture readings here Proverbs 1 7-9 says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction my son hear the instruction of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother for they shall be an ornament of Grace upon thy head and chains about thy neck and Proverbs 6:20 says my son keep thy father's commandment and forsake not the law of thy mother bind them continually upon thine heart and tie them about thine neck when thou goest it shall lead thee when thou sleepest it shall keep thee when thou awest it shall talk with thee for the Commandment is a lamp and the light and the law is light and reproofs of instructions are the way of life um so um I've been uh doing a little studying on on this and looking at some different things and there was a Sunday uh a teacher she had a group of uh second graders and she was teaching on on magnets and what they what they're used for and U sometime after that she had a she had they had the class had a test and she included one of the a question on the test and it said my full name has six letters the first one is m i pick up things what am I they said when she when the children turned in the tests and she checked almost half of them had answered mother and so I thought that was really good that you know because Mom's do so much for us and you know they help us out so much and um I was wanting to you know I was looking in the scripture I was trying to find something that you know to from the scripture and I I've been reading different ones and I've been uh just in my personal reading I've been reading in the Book of Proverbs quite a bit and uh I just i' had come across these and you know it says the the fear of the Lord is the beginning of of knowledge and you know God told us to honor our fathers and our mothers you know he said he said hear the instructions and forsake not the law of thy mother and it says and it shall be an ornament of Grace upon thy head and chains about thy neck and in Proverbs it tells us it said tie those about thy neck and I was looking at that and you know it talks about the uh ornament of Grace upon your head and see those are things that not just as in Proverbs where it talks about uh bind them continually upon your heart not just on the N word but when it talks about it being an ornament of Grace upon your head or chains about thy neck or binding them about your neck I was uh doing a little reading and you know it's those things are not just things that we take inwardly but it's things that are expressed outwardly and those things so it's not just things that um we we hold in our heart but it's things that we've learned and things that we've been instructed in that we ought to express and we should show those things and you know um I always tell everybody that you know I I look so much like my my dad and so many things um I I can see my dad but then you know uh people will tell me how much I'm like my mom I guess I have a a sense of humor and and different things and certain expressions and things that come from my mom and uh and somebody said that I have a uh the ability or the uh uh the uh I do it very often uh I always always make list out for everything you know I like to write everything down and my mom's got lists for lists because you know of of things that she writes down because she keeps up with everything but you know it's one of the things like you can't argue with her about uh points because you know she's got a list of everything that's been wrote down so uh she can she's got she's got evidence because she's got it in in black and white so um but you know that's way sometimes it it keeps it's a way of keeping up with things of knowing what's what needs to be done and what you you know keeping up with dates and different things like that because people well I'll just remember that well you won't and sometimes you you don't you don't remember those things and and uh I think it was Einstein that said pale linkk was better than good memory and so you know those things we we get from our our uh from our parents but you know that's one thing I always remember about mom she always had she had always had a list for everything and so th those things that that you've been taught you know write those things down but it's like um here where he was talking about forsake not the law of thy mother the things that you've learned from your parents and you know the one thing that I I think about my mom I never you know people always talk about ministers being Papa called Mama sent you know I can say I wasn't like that and so many times in my life when when I want to do something I always told everybody that my mom should have been a lawyer because I mean she always come up with all kinds of uh Arguments for or against something and it was always you know why or why not well my mom she she could build a case on why it should be or what because whatever she believed in she believed in and she build a case for her and you know and so there's a you know instead of um having somebody just try to push you into something I appreciate that she stood there and she was like you got to make this decision for yourself are you sure are you sure and sometimes I think that's really helped me be the person that I am today because I don't mind standing on my on two feet because it's not just having somebody hand you everything right because you know you start out with a mom and you know they feed you and they clothe you but you know there's there's uh milestones in your life there's certain levels that you've got to reach in life and you know one of the first things they try to do is teach you how to walk well you know you can't carry a child forever you've got to get to the point where they've got to put their feet on the ground and you know you got to let them and it's like all you can do is protect them and watch over them but you the rest of the time they got to do it on their own they got to learn how to pull up on their own you can't do do that for them they've got to learn how to balance on their own now you can hold their hand but they got to put their feet on the floor and they got to be able to walk on their own and there's some there's a time when you you go through that you know you got to turn them loose because they got to learn how to walk on their own and you just stand there and you're close by and you're just watching them just trying but they've got but they've got to turn loose and go on their own and all through all through life it it's the same it's the same thing we got to come to the place as they as they grow up you they've got to experience things on their own I mean and it's the same thing it's a turning loose and you just got to set up parameters for them to be in but they've got to be able to walk and all the other things you know you try to teach them right from wrong and even even just common courtesy and manners everything that's taught you you know you have to reinforce those things and just show them and I was I was when the boys were little you know you go back to things that happen in in your life experiences that you've had and you know it's just like you get to a certain age and and and Adam he's got really always had real bad allergies and you know it was all the time blowing his nose and everything like that it's like well listen you know you get to a point where somebody don't have to tell you go blow your nose you know because you know it's like well Mama blows your nose all the time cuz you know you're running around and she's trying to catch you come here so I blow your nose but then there's a time you know it's like somebody shouldn't have to tell you to do that you should be able to do that on your own Hey listen you know and then you know uh you know some children levite um they uh they you don't realize it but but they think they wear their cleanex and it's like it's like no no listen we we have handkerchiefs we have tissues we have things that you don't have to do that you know but I mean it goes there's a whole process of things that you have to learn but you know Mom pushes you in that way and you know and so you know you think about all the things that you you go through in life and and you know it's not just not just I know this morning we we talk about just our our moms as the ones that birthed us and raised us but you know there's a lot of women that you know I I I sometimes they don't think they get the recognition they ought to right just just because you don't birth the child that doesn't mean that this day is not yours and you know one of the things is uh when when you look at not not just the because in and just even in the um definition of the word it doesn't just necessarily mean women that birth children but it's a female parent somebody that fits into that category there's a lot of grandmothers that fit in that category there's a lot of aunts that fit in that category because you know that's that's the one female per uh lady there's a woman in your life that really had an impact on you growing up and you know some people you know they they lose their they lose their their biological mothers at an early age but there's somebody that's always been there to help raise you to help support you and you know even even as the as the Apostle Paul tells us in the scripture you know we should honor the older women as mothers and the younger women as sisters and you know I've always and I've always said and I always say this a lotone when I always talk about our church I tell them I've got a lot I've got a lot of moms here I feel I feel like I've got a lot of moms here and you know because over the over the 20s something years I've been here I feel like I've had a lot of moms that have really um tried to be very supportive of me and uh maybe give instruction too but you know it's it's a blessing that that you know so not only it just just a a female parent or somebody in that parenting role but somebody that had that was older had a or someone that was in Authority School teachers Sunday school teachers there's different ones that fit in that category that have that same motherly role and and and so this morning I I want to thank all the sisters and don't discount what you've done what God's called you to do because you know there's there's no there's no big eyes or little 's and um I want to I want to get to a few things that this morning if I if time holds but uh time's Moving on but uh you know I think about uh the uh the old the elderly uh sisters or somebody somebody that uh even the word mother talks about even the origin or the source of something somebody that's come and really helped you start out in a certain way or do the different things and it's not just but any kind of uh lady that's really helped you in your life your Sunday school teachers I know people that have talked about even even people that are uh piano teachers and different things like that have really had an impact in their life that uh you sew seeds into that into that person's life and many years later they still remember what that person's done for you and and not so I I think about all of those things and the the affection and and things that have been from different different sisters different women in your life that have really been a a blessing to you and you know I think today is a day not just think our biological moms but for all of those those ladies those sisters that have that have labored in whatever kind of way to be a blessing to you I I think we honor them today also and uh I was I was doing a little research and on this topic and uh just want to share a few things with you that uh I thought was uh really interesting U of all if you take all languages in all the all the world if you take every language and the first 23 words that are written in any language of any any so as far back as scientist and archaeologists or whoever linguist have studied all throughout the world one of the first 23 words that are written anywhere that we know of any known language one of those words is mother and I thought that was pretty amazing that and even when you go back and you start looking at the U atmology of words and you start tracing back how all these words uh fit together in the beginning and the root words and and you know even uh you go back and start looking at you go back to the Greek and the Hebrew and and Latin and and all these different ones and even you know uh just like Spanish you know being uh MRE being mother and mother and you know a lot of different uh languages mom is pretty close to being together because if you look how it goes back but uh I was reading and and this man was talking about the uh atmology of words when you start tracing it back to seeing how all this ties together and he said when you go and you start looking at the structure of words and he talks about mothers and the impact that they have in our lives and build and he's like if you follow this back far enough you'll find that we have two words that I thought was really interesting the first one is the word matter when you go back to because in science you know matter is what everything consists of so when you go back look at atams and all this it's matter and and so the root when you when you trace it back the root for the word matter goes back is tied to the same root that mother comes from because it all ties together because everything that we have comes from our mom she brings us she's our origin she's what brings us in and it all ties back together so the word matter as far as science the building blocks of all things are tied back to that same word but also the word material the material also goes back to that same route and I thought that was really interesting how all of that ties together because you know what what matters is what our moms teach us but and the and the M material so everything that we have are the building blocks of Our Lives come from our mom and it also when you look at the root word of that it all comes from the same word and even even when you go back even further into some of the other ones uh even the root word from the word Sans from the Sanskrit language um which is ma it me means to make and I thought that was really interesting because you know what that's where our moms are the ones that bring us into this and they're the ones that bring us life and they're the ones that show us what matters and they're the ones that give us the building block they give us the things that we need to be successful in life what matters is our moms and what matters in our lives are the things that our moms teach us and I thank God for mine that you know all of those things is brother uh brother Ryan my mind went blank but I was thinking about brother Brian talking about the Fifth Gospel you know we have we have the Bible but the first preacher that you have the first one that's going to teach you about God is your mother and here she is to teach you these things to bring you up in and admonition of God and to bring you to the place that you ought to come to not just in the in the natural and and showing you the things that you need naturally but the things that you need spiritually to bring you to the place that you need to be equipped because you know as as someone says if you if you uh if you get your child into Harvard but they don't make it to Heaven you failed because you know if we could if we just equip them just just for the natural world just to be successful here but if they're not successful if they don't get to the place spiritually that they need to be if that then you know what we we failed because I would much I would much rather my children know Jesus Christ in the power of his resurrection than to have all the money in the world that's right because you know what H what profit is a man if he gains the whole world and loses his own soul that's right and what will a man give in exchange for It soul and so it's really important to see those things what we need in this world and we see here in in Proverbs 31 you know it talks about the virtuous woman and her price it says her price is far above rubies and I'm not going I'm not going to get into that this morning but you know you you think about all the things that she done all the work that she put in and in the Scripture it says that her children rise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praiseth her all the things that she all the labor that she puts in and all the things that she done and the example and all of the service all the things that talks about there in Proverbs that that a woman does that a mom puts in all the work that she puts in and God calls her blessed and you know I can say that I am blessed this morning I've been really blessed and I before before I finish this morning you know you you look and brother randam says here in the message letting off the pressure he said we serve God in the category that we're put in and it comes back just the same and you know God brother br here and he's speaking of um there's a couple of people I want to look at but this morning you know when I was reading and and thinking about I always think about sister Ford I don't know if y'all remember Lloyd Ford was a was a friend of brother Brams and his his mom uh was Sister Ford and he called her mother Ford and you know he says you know he he said um when she passed away you know Lloyd come to brother randam and wanted her wanted him to do her funeral and and he says you know here is little mother forward as we know her and he said she washed my little dirty face when I was a little kid many times said they was as poor as as poor could be and he she was born a female a lovely girl but you know and all the things you know said talking about helping the neighbors and all kind of stuff the the testimony that she had but he said above all that he said I had the privilege one time of seeing that seed German gerz by by the Holy Spirit she was bornn again of the spirit of God he said now we're going to plant her in a little bit in the ground and it was talking about he said how can we intelligent say that she will not rise again and I always I always think about every time I hear that you know of of the testimony what kind of testimony we could live and always think about her and her testimony you know just just a poor lady there in the church and everything but you know she had a real impact on brother random and the other lady I always think of when when I think about Mother's Day and there's a lot of moms but you know I the one person that always stands out to me is uh Abraham Lincoln's stepmom her name was Sarah Bush Lincoln and we'll have the musicians come y'all y'all can come on but uh I always think about her you know he lost his he lost his birth mom when he was 9 years old and his stepmom she she she came into his life when he 10 years old but she was a very spiritual lady and she's the one that really saw that God had his had his hand upon Abraham Lincoln God had a calling in his life to do something great you know she would really encouraged him to study even though his dad just wanted him to be a worker like you know he worked on the farm and he worked on other Farms because he made money but there was a thing that she really instilled in him was the uh the Bible and Pilgrim's Progress you know she really had and she really encouraged him to study and and seek God because God had had a calling in his life and you know it's I always think about her because sometimes we think you know we we don't realize what the power impact that we have in people's lives and just because you're a stepmom or whatever doesn't mean that you are not meaningful you won't have an impact on people brother BR says he says he said your mother he said if you want to do anything for her he said do it 365 days a year he said go to her house and offer prayer and live for God that's the thing to do and bring up your children and when your children come up they'll call you blessed after you've passed on Beyond the Veil that's the real Spirit of motherhood and the real Spirit of Mother's Day Mother's Day is 365 days a year and so I I thank the Lord for all the all the blessings that I've I've received and not just from my mom but all the other sisters that have been a blessing to me and that's what I want to be I want you know because I want to I want to be an example that their their labor their hard work everything then we can show them what the example that they've taught us and so I want to thank each one of you this morning all the sisters it's been a it's been a a wonderful thing and we may not say it all the time but y'all certainly mean a lot to us amen and we could we couldn't do it without you but I appreciate each one of you God bless you
