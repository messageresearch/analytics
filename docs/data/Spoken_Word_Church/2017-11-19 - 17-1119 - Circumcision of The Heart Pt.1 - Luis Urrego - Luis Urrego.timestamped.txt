[0:05] okay good morning everybody
[0:13] don't wear your boots not gonna go
[0:15] anywhere you know it'll stay right there
[0:18] on those warmers justice uh but just
[0:20] let's warm our heart with the word just
[0:22] one concentrate on the word any man
[0:25] that's more important
[0:27] praise the Lord this morning we want to
[0:31] talk about a about circumcision of the
[0:33] heart this for the butter sneezed and I
[0:37] think carefully that's my sister
[0:39] Barbara's husband right if I got twenty
[0:46] long ball
[0:57] good we're fine I got one yeah we don't
[1:00] work no i got sterling all right all
[1:11] right listen we're going to talk about
[1:12] circumcision of the heart and we all
[1:15] know how important god instituted
[1:17] circumcision and back in the old
[1:21] testament not necessarily as that's
[1:26] something that we have to do now
[1:28] although it is still practice especially
[1:32] amongst the jews but the whole thing
[1:37] that god was boiling down to is that is
[1:41] that out he was more concerned about the
[1:47] heart than anything else and of course
[1:50] he could not get that through to the
[1:52] people of the Old Testament because the
[1:54] people of the Old Testament they were
[1:57] more like the people they're aware were
[2:00] like physical people's so they needed
[2:02] more fleshly physical type numb and they
[2:05] were they're a rough rough rough people
[2:07] back then you know and so you'd have to
[2:10] deal with them in this way so we're
[2:11] gonna kind of go through this and of
[2:13] course we're not going to get done we're
[2:15] gonna try to get done with what I have
[2:16] here but there's gonna be a part two
[2:18] because there's lots involved in this
[2:21] topic and though now you start studying
[2:23] in and it just leads to one thing to
[2:25] another one think there another
[2:26] somewhere so you're blessed sorry I'll
[2:32] get her stuff so circumcision of the
[2:34] heart
[2:35] what is circumcision and what does it
[2:37] mean to be spiritually circumcised
[2:41] they meant now in Colossians chapter 2
[2:45] verse 8 through 14 says this beware lest
[2:49] any man spoil you through philosophy and
[2:51] vain deceit after the tradition of men
[2:54] after the rudiments of the world and not
[2:56] after Christ for in him dwelleth all the
[3:00] fullness of the Godhead bodily and
[3:03] that's Jesus Christ right in ye and ye
[3:07] are complete in him I like that how Paul
[3:09] says that you are completely not that
[3:13] you will be and at this very moment it
[3:15] might not seem like it made me steal
[3:18] stumbling and fall in and in there but
[3:20] you are complete the Bible says I want
[3:22] to confess what the word says emigrate
[3:24] and you are complete in him which is the
[3:26] head of all principality and power verse
[3:29] 11 in whom also ye are circumcised with
[3:34] the circumcision made without hands
[3:36] that's right amen so this is not
[3:39] something visible in putting off the
[3:42] body of the sins of the flesh by the
[3:45] circumcision of Christ so it's talking
[3:48] about two circumcisions here a physical
[3:50] circumcision and the circumcision of
[3:51] Christ I've been buried with him in
[3:54] Baptism wherein also ye are risen with
[3:58] him through the faith of the operation
[4:01] of God who had raised him from the dead
[4:04] and you being dead in your sins and the
[4:07] SIRT uncircumcision of your flesh in it
[4:10] have he quickened together with him
[4:13] having forgiven you all trespasses so
[4:16] Paul here is telling us that before we
[4:19] come to Christ we were uncircumcised in
[4:21] the flesh spiritually all right all
[4:26] right you could good I mean you could go
[4:28] out here and do whatever you wanted to
[4:29] and now feel not one remorse of
[4:32] not one thing go out here smoke
[4:34] cigarettes drink hangout perrales do
[4:37] whatever and I didn't feel not one thing
[4:39] about nothing bothered me in my heart
[4:40] but once once Christ come and I and I
[4:44] saw and the law in I've been reading in
[4:46] Romans the book of Romans my wife and
[4:48] I've been reading the book of Romans and
[4:50] how Paul lays that out up there and
[4:52] speaking about circumcision and how the
[4:55] knowledge of the law allowed me to have
[4:58] knowledge of what was wrong in my life
[5:00] you see what I'm saying in other words
[5:02] the knowledge of the word because
[5:04] without all of us have when we come to
[5:06] this world we have a conscience you know
[5:10] some people know that there are certain
[5:12] things that are wrong and and some
[5:14] certain things that are not wrong but
[5:17] but that wasn't really settled until
[5:20] Christ's payment of body my holy spirit
[5:22] huns and the bonds in your heart
[5:24] amen praise the Lord verse 14 says
[5:27] blotting out the handwriting of
[5:28] Ordinances that was against us which was
[5:30] contrary which was contrary to us and
[5:33] took it out of the way nailing it to his
[5:36] cross amen
[5:38] I like that yeah that means it was dead
[5:41] am ia man lately praise the Lord so the
[5:45] word circumcision at me it comes from
[5:48] the Latin word means sequence CCO and I
[5:50] can say that because it's from the left
[5:55] see the boom sees you maybe I can't
[6:02] speak let a lot of things are they say
[6:04] Latin I'd say so
[6:06] spending garage from day one huh I'm
[6:09] tingling not that one it's hard yeah I
[6:13] think that that's right sounds like it's
[6:16] only down here in the south yeah c'est
[6:19] comme si Co comes from circum meaning
[6:23] around and cadet meaning to cut a mint
[6:27] so we are all adults here and we know
[6:30] what happens in circumcision by hand
[6:31] limit on the eighth day this was
[6:34] practiced by the Jews they cut the
[6:36] foreskin of the little baby representing
[6:39] something which we were going to get to
[6:40] in just a moment and of course to this
[6:42] day they still practice it now not all
[6:44] the countries it's it's required to for
[6:47] you to search inside your child but but
[6:50] in some countries state they just do it
[6:52] and then praise God
[6:57] now in the 12 13th and 15th chapters of
[7:01] Genesis God had made the following of
[7:05] unconditional promises to Abraham and if
[7:09] you read if you read those chapters up
[7:11] you'll see everything more things in
[7:13] detail but this is kind of break down
[7:15] that his descendants would be more
[7:17] numerous than the stars in the sky and
[7:20] that his seat would be as the dust of
[7:22] the earth the dust of the earth the
[7:27] Bible said not not the dust of what for
[7:29] civic life but the dust of the earth
[7:30] amen yes it's amazing that through his
[7:34] descendants all the nations would be
[7:36] blessed right and that Abraham's people
[7:41] would be given a great land to occupy
[7:43] and that all who bless them would in
[7:45] turn be blessed of course those who
[7:47] cursed them for the curse and mentally
[7:49] praised God and God gave Abraham the
[7:54] these unconditional promises first and
[7:57] then later in Genesis 17 God changes his
[8:00] name from Abram to Abraham and gives him
[8:03] the sign that he was going to keep those
[8:06] promises in verse 11 so he gives him
[8:09] these unconditional promises first and
[8:12] when God gives a promise he don't break
[8:14] those Broncos right but he but he then
[8:17] he gives Abraham a sign to show that he
[8:21] was going to keep these these promises
[8:23] he was so we read here in Genesis 17 I
[8:26] want you to just read with me he says
[8:28] this is my covenant which ye shall keep
[8:30] between me and you and thy seed after
[8:34] thee so see he was expecting for this
[8:36] covenant to be kept after the seed of
[8:39] Abraham as well right
[8:41] remember thinking in your mind that this
[8:44] is a key thing in God this is all people
[8:47] he was more relating to the spiritual
[8:49] aspect of it but of course he had to
[8:51] start physical right and then you can go
[8:54] with a lot in that amen but uh but so
[8:59] just continue reading here every man
[9:00] child among you shall be circumcised
[9:02] that's the word of the Lord right
[9:05] and ye shall circumcise verse 11 ye
[9:07] shall circumcise the flesh of your
[9:09] foreskin and there shall be a token
[9:11] meaning a sign right of the Covenant
[9:15] betwixt me and you I would love for God
[9:19] to be talk talking to me like that this
[9:21] is a covenant between me and you Abraham
[9:24] doesn't come to between me and you
[9:25] sister cannot come between you me and
[9:28] you brother wait in the restaurant
[9:29] descended on for just right verse 12 and
[9:42] he that is eight days old shall be
[9:45] circumcised among you every man child in
[9:48] your generations he that is born in the
[9:51] house or bought with money of any
[9:53] stranger which is not of thy seat so in
[9:56] other words people who would wanted to
[9:58] join or walk with the people of Israel
[10:00] at that time they had to be circumcised
[10:03] for mob because this was a sign that
[10:04] differentiated them from the rest of the
[10:07] people right he that is born in thy
[10:10] house and he that is bought with my
[10:11] money must needs be circumcised you see
[10:15] how the Bible words that and my covenant
[10:18] shall be in your flesh for an
[10:21] everlasting covenant now if you know if
[10:23] you see underline that because the word
[10:26] everlasting doesn't mean eternal that's
[10:28] right there's a temper there is a
[10:30] temporary time amen
[10:33] so I'm just wondering this is me
[10:36] thinking I'm just wondering if God's
[10:37] thinking this is only gonna be for
[10:39] temporary start again it's not gonna be
[10:42] in the flesh and him over later on it's
[10:43] gonna come into the heart praise God now
[10:45] that's the ever that's the eternal
[10:47] colour
[10:48] a memory and the uncircumcised man child
[10:51] whose flesh of his fortune isn't the
[10:54] foreskin is not circumcised
[10:56] look I said that soul shall be cut off
[10:59] from his people he had broken my
[11:01] covenant so to me is I'm reading this I
[11:05] don't know about you but I'm reading
[11:06] also the spiritual aspect of it as well
[11:08] amen God referring to the soul amen
[11:11] yes at the same time he's dealing with
[11:14] physical and aspect of it as well so God
[11:18] he was going to keep his covenant to
[11:20] Abraham with no strings attached
[11:22] and he used circumcision as a sign amen
[11:27] now it was important to God to
[11:29] physically show forth the promise he had
[11:32] made to Abraham why because he wanted it
[11:35] to be visible he wanted it to be shown
[11:37] he wanted it to - for them also who had
[11:41] the circumcision applied to them to see
[11:43] hey especially a male hey I'm part of
[11:48] I'm part of God's name I'm taking I'm
[11:50] part of this covenant amen hey cuz I see
[11:53] it myself and then if anybody else wants
[11:55] to know hey - oh man that's and that's
[12:04] the reason why he instituted instituted
[12:06] circumcision as a sign now God still
[12:10] shows forth signs in order to confirm
[12:12] the promises he has made to us in his
[12:14] word such promises far today are
[12:16] included but not limited to the
[12:18] vindication of Malachi 4:2 us okay men
[12:21] I'm just giving some examples here the
[12:23] cloud in Arizona sign of the opening
[12:25] when God pillow program to go preach the
[12:28] seven seals is there God was going to
[12:30] open that but most importantly God given
[12:34] us the holy go game amen
[12:36] thus that's so that's the promise that
[12:43] God will fulfill if you do your part but
[12:46] I know if you do your part he'll do this
[12:50] and that's just that's just as simple as
[12:53] that he meant but what did jesus said
[12:56] jesus said give the Holy Ghost to them
[12:59] that obey Him my truck alright Emma do
[13:04] so Abraham he had to believe upon that
[13:09] sign of circumcision before he he could
[13:12] act upon it right he had to actually and
[13:16] if you read the background of Abraham I
[13:19] mean he's here
[13:20] God's talking to Abraham and can you
[13:22] imagine Abraham you know got a man that
[13:25] a person that he cannot even see which
[13:27] later on he see he's telling him to
[13:28] leave his country I only have to do all
[13:31] these different things and he has to
[13:33] have faith that that voice is leading
[13:35] him in the right direction that's uh
[13:39] that's that's faith saying amen but
[13:43] Abraham he couldn't believe on that sign
[13:45] or he until of that sinusoid position
[13:48] and to uh you have to believe upon it
[13:51] first in order for him to act on it
[13:53] mercy and that's the same thing with you
[13:55] and me you know when it comes to
[13:57] salvation you have to believe on the
[13:59] Lord Jesus Christ amen and then God can
[14:02] do his his part you see you have to feel
[14:04] I believe on the Lord then God can fill
[14:07] you with the Holy Spirit amen amen
[14:09] so in Abraham believing that son and
[14:12] obey nahee was believing the word that
[14:14] God had made him back to Genesis 12 and
[14:16] 15 same thing with us today and in order
[14:20] for us to benefit from having our heart
[14:22] circumcised by the Holy Ghost we must we
[14:25] must have faith in the promises of God
[14:27] through his word
[14:29] because you can't believe the word of
[14:31] first on the unless is presented to you
[14:34] then you can act upon it until it's
[14:36] presented to you it hurts you seniors
[14:38] and I like I put Ephesians chapter 1
[14:41] because it I like this it ties in with
[14:43] it says verse 13 and whom ye also
[14:46] trusted after that ye heard the word of
[14:49] truth
[14:50] so you trusted in that word of right
[14:53] amen and it was after that ye heard the
[14:56] word of truth is it's when you trusted
[14:58] in the driver because I mean you can't
[15:00] believe on something unless you hear the
[15:05] gospel of your salvation in whom also
[15:08] after that ye believed you were sealed
[15:12] with that Holy Spirit of promise again
[15:14] let's look back at Abraham it wasn't
[15:17] until he believed God that's why he's
[15:20] considered such a great man in Hebrews
[15:22] it talks about him how his faith was
[15:24] great him and all that because he
[15:26] believed God amen he believed God when
[15:30] nervous all he was was just hearing God
[15:32] but yet he still believed him amen and
[15:35] all we have today is the word you know
[15:38] jesus said that jesus said blessed are
[15:42] your eyes amen but I said blessed are
[15:45] you who believed in them and then have
[15:47] something physical to be presented to
[15:49] you see I wasn't there in brother Browns
[15:51] meetings I wasn't there in those in
[15:53] those healing campaigns and those things
[15:55] those physical things amen but you're
[15:58] more blessed that you believe now even
[16:00] though you weren't in there that's right
[16:02] you're more black sighted and so he when
[16:04] Jesus told Thomas he said Thomas blessed
[16:07] are those who believe and did not even
[16:10] see did not even require physical
[16:13] physical contact or anything like that
[16:17] you see a lot of people we think that we
[16:20] have to feel something you know when I
[16:21] can
[16:22] when I came to the message it wasn't
[16:23] like this in the Baptist Church when I
[16:26] was in the Baptist Church you know it it
[16:28] was just you accept the Lord Jesus
[16:30] Christ as your Lord and Savior and and
[16:32] the Bible said it so you believe it and
[16:34] you go on
[16:35] that's almost a up almost a little bit
[16:37] more faith than we do here in the
[16:38] message we think we have to feel
[16:40] something and we have to run and shout
[16:42] in order for us to think that we
[16:44] received something from the service so
[16:46] when I came into the message and then I
[16:47] started hearing the preaching and things
[16:51] like that I felt like I had to get up
[16:53] and shout and run all over the place and
[16:56] do things like that I don't for me to
[16:57] get something but later on God revealed
[17:00] to me men it's not all those things are
[17:04] great there's nothing wrong with them
[17:05] anyway you know if you you know if God
[17:08] deals with you in that way praise the
[17:10] Lord
[17:10] but some of us God God doesn't deal with
[17:14] us in in the same way you know someone
[17:16] was a little bit more quiet more
[17:17] reserved but doesn't mean God's not
[17:20] speaking in your heart it doesn't mean
[17:22] that the word is not having an effect in
[17:24] your life and that you're not changing
[17:26] from day to day and that's right
[17:27] praise God so it's easy for those who
[17:31] who are to be critical those who are a
[17:34] little bit more Pentecostal to be
[17:35] critical of those are a little bit more
[17:36] quiet right right and then those that
[17:38] are more quiet you'll be critical of
[17:40] those they're a little bit more
[17:41] Pentecostal after Satan right there has
[17:43] to be a balance we have to respect one
[17:46] another and respect how the Lord wants
[17:48] to deal with especially in the services
[17:50] they met here praise God because God
[17:53] deals with us in different ways as long
[17:55] as the word is being fulfilled and as
[17:57] long as the word is changing you from
[17:59] day to day amen you were sealed with
[18:03] that Holy Spirit of promise verse 14
[18:05] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[18:07] by the way speaking about the
[18:09] inheritance their brother team humans
[18:11] amen which was awesome until the
[18:14] redemption of the purchased possession
[18:17] of it amen so this circumcision that God
[18:21] gave to Abraham was was just the earnest
[18:27] in other words of what the real
[18:29] circumcision of that God was really
[18:32] to get to amen in other words it was the
[18:34] down payment right that's right
[18:36] same thing with us amen the the earnest
[18:38] of our inheritance the Holy Ghost that
[18:40] we received is just the earnest for just
[18:44] the downpayment of the full full
[18:48] Redemption and it meant to our bodies
[18:49] they managed right oh praise God this is
[18:51] just one little part that's it one
[18:53] little one little part but it's glorious
[18:55] even I mean just to be able to have this
[18:58] part a minute just this little part can
[19:00] you imagine when we get that body
[19:02] changing having that full Redemption it
[19:05] says until the redemption of the
[19:06] purchased possession payment
[19:08] got priced up for you and me yes
[19:10] whenever the purchased possession part
[19:12] yes you promised this amen the full
[19:15] redemption praise God unto the praise of
[19:17] his glory praise the Lord Amen now
[19:23] brother Branham says here he says and if
[19:26] he has never circumsized you yet by the
[19:28] Holy Ghost he hasn't received your faith
[19:31] yet that's right that is the
[19:34] circumcision of the heart and spirit God
[19:38] gives the Holy Ghost as a confirmation
[19:40] that he has received your faith now if
[19:44] you stop believing in scrum bling I'm
[19:47] not sure if that was a typo in the
[19:49] message or if he actually said that bit
[19:51] of it will just go too strongly around
[19:54] not scrambling eggs and scrambling
[19:57] around and just believe God God will
[20:01] circumcise that heart is his promise
[20:04] even ahead and that cuts off all
[20:07] unbelief circumcised is the world and
[20:10] all unbelief away from you and then you
[20:13] stand the word alone jesus said if ye
[20:17] abide in me and my word in you then ask
[20:19] what you will it'll be given to you
[20:21] that's what's the matter with the church
[20:23] today it's under emotion it's under
[20:26] education it's under Creed no wonder its
[20:29] mother down see
[20:31] so we need a circumcision to cut the
[20:33] whole thing away come back to God and
[20:36] His Word and believe it the way it's
[20:39] wrote there that's how Abraham did was
[20:42] believe exactly what God said and acted
[20:45] upon that it's wrote there and don't
[20:47] argue with it just stay with it
[20:51] God made a promise God keeps his promise
[20:53] he can't do nothing else but keep his
[20:55] promise and remain God amen so if the
[20:59] word says it we can put our we can bank
[21:02] we can bank on it amen that God's going
[21:04] to fulfill that it in that room now the
[21:08] Rite of circumcision was continued in
[21:11] the time of Moses it was made part of
[21:13] the law of Moses several hundred years
[21:15] later when God gave instruction
[21:17] concerning the birth of a male and we
[21:19] see that in Leviticus 1213 where it says
[21:21] and in the eighth day the flesh of his
[21:24] foreskin shall be circumcised they meant
[21:27] letting us know that God never changed
[21:31] this mind about his word while he had
[21:33] told Abraham maybe 100 years before or
[21:36] several hundred years before he was
[21:38] still getting the children that his
[21:41] people they meant to continue practicing
[21:43] the same thing right you know this was
[21:45] still physical right amen
[21:48] this and so that God does not change my
[21:53] advice but since he told Abraham that
[21:54] this was the Covenant that he was making
[21:56] with his seed also we just read that
[21:58] just a moment ago so just because you're
[22:01] under a new administration or messenger
[22:03] God's Word did not change concerning
[22:05] certain Sarah now in our day brother
[22:10] Brandon - our messenger for our day he
[22:13] didn't come to give us a new Bible
[22:16] everything that brother Branham preached
[22:18] was already landlord amen he was was
[22:21] restoring you that there was eaten know
[22:23] that right
[22:24] nothing new there's not a new thing for
[22:26] women to have long hair there was not a
[22:28] new thing for us to go to church and
[22:31] knowledge you know just different things
[22:32] that brother Branham had to constantly
[22:34] preaching it to the Pentecostal babies
[22:37] at the time right none of that was new
[22:39] it was just restoring back they meant
[22:41] nothing had changed what moment Moses
[22:44] came on the scene the word still remain
[22:46] the same nothing look nothing has
[22:48] changed God's Word still remains the
[22:50] same favorite and there our day is not
[22:52] physical circumcision right it's
[22:53] spiritual circumcision they God is
[22:56] looking for him and the Holy Ghost is
[22:58] they received it back in the day of
[22:59] Pentecost as the same Holy Ghost that we
[23:01] received today and it's got to come the
[23:04] same way a minute praise the Lord make
[23:07] me a different way no better time
[23:08] there's no there's no modern new birth
[23:11] there are no change in the door when you
[23:13] receive your new birth no there isn't
[23:15] the church it's out you know and even in
[23:17] some message ranks just because you
[23:22] believe the message or because you
[23:23] believe that God sent a prophet you know
[23:26] that that has nothing to do with you
[23:28] being a Christian the press writers for
[23:30] a man a sinner out here could believe
[23:33] God sent a prophet at us day but that
[23:35] doesn't mean that he's in the message or
[23:37] that he's he's Christ dwelling in him
[23:40] and they cried in and he's dwelling in
[23:41] Christ that was right no
[23:47] and we see later that the children of
[23:49] Israel wandered around the wilderness
[23:50] for 40 years after they had come out of
[23:52] Egypt now I don't want to get too much
[23:55] into this because this is leading to
[23:57] what I want to preach about on Tuesday
[23:59] but though I want to look at something
[24:02] here a quick the problem was that they
[24:04] came out of Egypt but Egypt have not
[24:07] come out of saraswathi's right right
[24:09] they thought they thought that they were
[24:12] ready to leave but when they faced the
[24:17] hardships of the out there in the
[24:20] wilderness I'm ready to go back to eat
[24:23] and garlic and onion stays good this man
[24:28] that doesn't taste like anything but God
[24:31] was raining it down automatically on
[24:33] autopilot nobody was pushing a button or
[24:36] nothing God has given them food and God
[24:38] says okay there they're crying for me
[24:41] God sends quails God sends water
[24:44] provides water for them all these things
[24:46] on autopilot just the way we have it
[24:49] today that's right and we still complain
[24:51] that's right that's right we still
[24:54] complain right yeah we could push
[24:56] buttons and we can we can our cars now
[24:59] start with buttons in there right and we
[25:02] still think about that so at some point
[25:10] in the journey this practice of
[25:12] circumcision was stopped and God was
[25:17] concerned about this and so we're gonna
[25:19] see what happens in the days of Joshua
[25:21] under that new administrator a bad new
[25:23] messenger today meant see God never
[25:26] changed his mind about his work the
[25:27] people were the one that changed my way
[25:29] and so we're gonna read this here real
[25:31] quick almost tell me how one minute no
[25:35] way
[25:37] let's reach out Joshua chapter 5 let's
[25:41] pay attention that is what what what's
[25:42] what's this it says and it came to pass
[25:45] when all the kings of that of the
[25:48] amorite switch were on the side of
[25:49] Jordan West were now this is after the
[25:52] the children of Israel had crossed and
[25:54] Amen to the promised land
[25:55] come on well they were already in the
[25:57] promised land I don't want to get too
[25:59] far in this because I'm there all right
[26:02] and there's so many things tied in to us
[26:05] I'm not good name which were on the side
[26:08] of Jordan westward and all the kings of
[26:10] the Canaanites which were by the sea
[26:11] heard that the Lord had dried up the
[26:14] waters of Jordan from before the
[26:16] children of Israel until we were passed
[26:19] over that their heart melted neither was
[26:23] their spirit in them any more because of
[26:24] the children of Israel so the people
[26:26] around them were scared that's right
[26:27] because God had opened up this river for
[26:31] them and and at that time it was
[26:33] believed it was flooded out of the bus
[26:35] yeah it was flooded and there was no way
[26:38] that people could cross all these all
[26:40] these people could cross and they
[26:42] crossed on dry ground
[26:43] not not not wet ground not muddy ground
[26:47] the Bible says dry a man let's see all
[26:52] right and then verse 2 at that time the
[26:55] Lord said unto Joshua this is after they
[26:57] crossed over me make these sharp knives
[26:59] and circumcise again the children of
[27:02] Israel the second time - so here there
[27:05] at the promised land and God said you
[27:08] know they probably felt like we've made
[27:10] it we're here we've crossed over but God
[27:12] said no there's something else you got
[27:14] to do circumcision the second time and
[27:21] Joshua made him sharp knives and
[27:23] circumcise the children of Israel at the
[27:25] heel of the foreskins and this is the
[27:28] cause why Joshua did circumcise listen
[27:30] to this all the people that came out of
[27:33] Egypt that were males even all the men
[27:36] aboard died in the wilderness by the way
[27:39] after they came out
[27:40] Egypt thinking about that as a typhoon
[27:42] our day now all the people that came out
[27:45] were circumcised came out of Egypt but
[27:48] all the people that were born in the
[27:50] wilderness by the way as they came forth
[27:52] out of Egypt then they had not
[27:54] circumcised them yet they had a crossed
[27:56] over to the drugs to the promised right
[27:58] for the children of Israel walked 40
[28:01] years in the wilderness till all the
[28:03] people that were men of war which came
[28:05] out of Egypt were consumed in other
[28:08] words dead because they obeyed not the
[28:10] voice of the Lord unto whom the Lord
[28:12] swear swear up that he would not show
[28:15] them the land including Moses which the
[28:17] Lord swear unto their fathers that he
[28:20] would give us a land that floweth with
[28:22] milk and honey and their children whom
[28:25] he raised up in their stead damn
[28:28] Joshua circumcised for they were
[28:30] uncircumcised because they had not
[28:32] circumcise them by the way and it came
[28:35] to pass when they had done circumcise
[28:37] and all the people that they avoid in
[28:38] their places in the camp till they were
[28:40] whole and the Lord said unto Joshua this
[28:42] day have I rolled away the reproach of
[28:44] Egypt from off of you wherefore the name
[28:47] of the place is called Gilgal on may
[28:48] this day now I don't want to get too
[28:51] much into detail with this but I want to
[28:53] talk about this on Tuesday Lord will and
[28:55] glad you can see that even under this
[28:58] new administration God had not changed
[29:00] his mind about the word of Noah bodies
[29:02] more than he had given to Abraham and
[29:04] hundreds of years before that same thing
[29:07] with Moses and here comes this new
[29:09] messenger
[29:10] dr. Joshua was Joshua types the Holy
[29:12] Spirit in our thing God has not changed
[29:14] his mind about physical circumcision at
[29:17] that time and neither has the Holy
[29:19] Spirit changed his mind about spiritual
[29:21] circumcision in our day that's right
[29:22] amen
[29:23] and so though people had to be willing
[29:28] to be able to be circumcised by Joshua
[29:30] these children on the Joshua could just
[29:32] okay God said God said the circumcised
[29:36] but the people had to receive and
[29:38] believe that God had spoke to Joshua and
[29:42] Stephen accept that and they offer
[29:43] themselves as a sacrifice and I win baby
[29:49] now they were waiting when a year ago
[29:51] absolutely now you also think about
[29:53] Abraham and Abraham was God told Abraham
[29:56] to circumcise himself and he was 99
[29:58] years old all right think about it
[30:02] brother
[30:05] that's it I should go up and you know
[30:08] what happened they walk new after you're
[30:12] circumcised you won't get absolutely no
[30:15] that but it is the foreskin and said
[30:41] you're a bloody husband - she wasn't
[30:43] talking British either yeah I think she
[30:53] was willing more to practice that more
[30:54] than Moses was enough time because most
[30:57] of us that was in such a hurry I've got
[30:59] to go free the people from the Lord
[31:00] that's right and he forgetting that the
[31:02] word of the Lord was still that was
[31:04] still part of the word of Lord a man so
[31:06] a man well it's just good let's go out
[31:08] we'll continue this next text on the
[31:10] girl
