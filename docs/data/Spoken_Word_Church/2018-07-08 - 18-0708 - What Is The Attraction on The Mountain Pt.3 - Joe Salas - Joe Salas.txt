something so the real of scriptures but what I do so I hope you had a good week the one way to find the Statue of Liberty and a lot of people that want to see this especially if it can see it because they turn them back so this world is so we didn't get on the umbrella and we went to the nursing home and we thought we didn't do anything don't worry it came on us start shaking it the people's hands one day they say you know thank you for coming you really blessed me with God's work that's the word to use like that she knows about the minister that's what we talk so like I say you think you think you go somewhere any of that you know you have a new service could be one person today I want to continue my thought of mountains so I'll turn a finish to that to start something new but we're gonna sell they named everything mountains you know Stone Mountain Ridge Mountain actually over here in Jefferson this is the street name say we're climbing a mountain see God God is drawing us up we're not being pushed by by anyone so it's our daily walk you know see we're not all I'm saying level everybody's in that different level you know but we were saying by His grace and foremothers so if your son or daughter of God no matter which road you decide to take he'll he'll get you there okay you've got your boat ready let's go to exit x2 this chapter three and we'll read 1 through 15 but I got you guys I got all right here in this book Exodus 3 chapter 3 and the start of it first one through 15 [Applause] now Moses kept the clock jetrel Hispano the priests immediately made human priests so whatever the Moses wanted to do he would not push him or do what he let him do whatever whatever mostly wanted to do and he meant to fall to the back side of the desert and came to the mountain of God even to a barrel and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and they find my father out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush farm with fire and the bush was not consumed and mother said I will not turn outside and see this great sight why the bush is not burning and when the North so that he turn aside to see God called him God called him I haven't messed with the butcher said Moses Moses and he said Here I am and he said growing up hither put up thy shoes from my feet for the place where the standard is holy ground moreover he said I am the God of the father the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God and the Lord said I had surely seen the affliction of my people to which I need you and have heard their cry because the reason of their taskmasters for northern sorrows and I come down to deliver them out of a Hanna Egyptian stick to bring them up out of the land into a good man and order into the land flowing with milk and honey unto the priests of the Canaanites and hypnotize MRIs and all the dictates now therefore we go Vic are the children of immigrants is come unto me I have also seen the oppression were the Egyptians oppress them come now therefore now the same being to parody them and bring forth my people but Israel out of Egypt and Moses said unto God Who am I that I should go unto Pharaoh and that I should bring for the children for it for the children of Israel out of Egypt and he said certainly I will be mean I show this should be a token of to be that have sandy point that has brought for the people either you should serve God upon this mountain we should serve God upon this mountain the mountain they were climbing and Moses said I've developed before when I commented children Israel I said unto them the god of your father's has sent me unto you and they shall said to me what is his name what shall stand to them and God said unto Moses I am that I am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel I am hath sent me unto you and God said moreover unto Moses thus shalt thou say unto children Israel day nor that your father the God of Abraham the god and Jacob sent sent me unto you this is my name forever and this is my memorial unto all generation like I said before Moses father-in-law was a priest he then I pushed Moses into whatever you know it it's your daily walk do you a God Exodus 4:18 and most of my night and return to generous father mom said unto him let me go are Tralee and returned unto my brethren which I need to and see whether they be alive and gentle said up to Moses go in peace amen let's go to Exodus 19 three and four chapter xix three and multi went up and to God and the Lord called him a lot of the mountain saying does not shalt say unto the house of Jacob I tell the children of Israel you have seen what I did until Egyptians and how I bore you on eagle's wings and I brought you unto myself this sounds the 1:03 let's start with first one to 22 and then I'll read the first when you go to read the second one I need less than or to hold my soul and then I within me bless His Holy Name forgive all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases which says by that month with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the Eagles dessicated righteousness [Music] you mean all these ways unto Moses he's excellent to the children of Israel demerit older than gracious name amazing that mercy he will not always shy even keep peace anger forever for as the headlight is high above the earth so is bringing this mercy toward them that fear him and as far as the east is from the west so far has he removed our transgressions from us like a father pities his children so the Lord pities them they fear Him as for man his days are as crass as a flower of the field so he pours but the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them they fear him and his right side up to its children the Lord had prepared his tawny heaven and his keys words let's see the Lord only the horse you ministers of if that do displeasure the Lord always works not a place of instant I wrote a little people one time

approach the eagle is a sign of freedom strength immortality and authority man has reproduced an image of the evil and point and the skills and play the evil is a heavenly birth so what are we worried good we're not chicken you can fly see part of the under I know the other part the chicken is the verb justify evil who is but is it is an earthbound creature he can fluff and claw but it can scarcely get his feet off the ground and Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ but they were mention our sins and you shall receive that gift of the Holy Ghost program said chicken denominational one day a father out west put an Eagles in the chicken we did have it was one they fun is picking paint a of a solo the chicken or picked on him because they
