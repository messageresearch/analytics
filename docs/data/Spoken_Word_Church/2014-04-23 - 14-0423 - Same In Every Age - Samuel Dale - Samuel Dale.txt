if you've got anything to say to himself we'll see you outside don't don't stand in here and talk it's not good for the next service coming on and to do you know and we do everything in decently in

visitor because she's been here before so we count everybody here when you come one time you visit her two times you're part of us so we're just doing that Hebrews 13 8 if I'm missing any announcements I generally always miss something but let's pray father we thank you for this day in your love and your grace unto us thank you for all things and you said you gave them to us freely so we thank you and we just ask you to help in God each and every one of us now as we talk about you for a little bit and Lord as we try to honor you and your love and your grace unto us and father Just

and we ask you to do that again today Lord and just have your way with all of us we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen and we're going to read from Hebrews 13 you know everybody reads Hebrews 13 8. and uh you know talks about Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and and I've heard that preached um before you have two by people that uh didn't even believe in one true and living God well you know how can he be Hebrews 13 8. same yesterday today and forever if you've got a trinities or thoughts in your mind that's you know how can you do it because it would he wouldn't be correct it wouldn't be but they missed the other parts of it let's go to verse 5. let your conversation which means your manner of life that doesn't mean you're just you're talking but remember you're talking in your manner of Life what you're living your conversation the way you live and your mannerism you know and you're doing all right let your conversation let your manner of Life your your talking your doings be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have for he has said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee so don't worry about the future don't worry about doing just live day by day and just let everything be right right verse 6 so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what men shall do unto me see then if if I distrust him and and don't worry about it that don't mean you don't save and put up for a rainy day you should but don't worry about those things see why because your Lord will be your your helper now look what it says remember them which have the rule over you that rule is not a rod of iron rule what is it he explains what it is remember them with how the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God see that's what rules over you is the word of God not man and Mankind and his doings it's the word of God so remember that remember his manner of conversation all right remember then which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith father watch now considering the end of their conversation watch the end of what anybody's trying to bring now watch the end of his conversation is supposed to be what Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever but he that curieth about be not cared about with divers and strange doctrines where it is a good thing that the heart be established with Grace not with Meats which have not profited them that have been occupied their end you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word as I said last Sunday you know we had a lot of company and a baby dedication and had a good time doing it Brother Anderson and them live through it and they made it and uh but we tried to make a just a message part to where it would relate to everybody and trying to preach about how did he says there in Malachi 3 says I am the Lord and I changed not all right now if the Old Testament would end up as I was saying with Malachi being the last book of the Old Testament and he covers it I am the Lord and I change not right all right then when we get over it to say in last week we get over the Book of Revelations which ends the New Testament part and he talks about I am and all that who he is and and all of that then we read Hebrews 13 8 it says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now remember Jesus was not humanly speaking back in the Old Testament that's understandable all right but that's why Paul is using the word Jesus Christ was back there Christ was in all the scriptures all right and then Jesus being the the name of God so then you can put Jesus Christ and see he could say Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today and no matter how long it would continue in life forever that he's the same any change is not but do we believe that he realized that they took that as we'll get to it in a little bit and they took that scripture at nicaea and they you know brought it down to a trinitarian Doctrine a concept of three gods Our God in three persons Blessed Trinity and how could it be Hebrews 13 8. now if you've got three Gods you've got three persons you've got three persons you got three Gods what whatever you've got so think about it if he's the same yesterday today and forever all right how can you in any point or thought conceive any idea of him being God here but not the same here and not the same here you know yesterday today and forever all right and if he changes where could you depend on it who's going to tell us where the changes are well see that's what man's tried to do they've tried to say well God changed here and God changed her and we are the people that will let you know we're changed that well if he said that he doesn't change and we say he does change now who are we where has mankind got any right or thought to uh change any of the word of God well we got it we got more Revelation now more revelation of what like I told you that man that worked there that time that I was talking to him about water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he said yeah that's right they baptized that way back there I thought well I'm going to run into somebody at least maybe he knows a little bit about the truth I said in other words you believe they they baptized in Bible times in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said yeah I said well what about now he said oh he said he said we baptized father son Holy Ghost now because we got a better revelation and said they were trinitarians back there but said we understand now I thought I always understood the Jews to be one true and living God I didn't know that was dark but see that's what somebody had told the man right somebody had told him that and he quoted that some preacher had preached it we baptized father son Holy Ghost now because we've got a deeper Revelation a revelation of what how does a revelation change anything that's written in the word of God and then who do we go for to get that Revelation that was what I was trying to bring out Sunday but I want us to go in a in a thought in it this morning and maybe this afternoon to to think about it and to think about how this statement would be so outstanding as I said then we took verse 6 to talk about it that remember them which are the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God now it's only the word of God that has rule over you mankind can't rule see that's what we think well we think the pastor is this we think I'm actually the shepherd that's true but I'm actually a servant and I don't rule Over You by lordship with rule by honor and respect and all but any Pastor is supposed to rule by the word that they bring all right so you consider their conversation you consider it a revelation consider what they're saying and see if it fits in the word of God I heard this morning about a certain brother that and I thought well that's a good point a certain brother that we all would know of in the message that he went and told his church that he wanted to take a couple weeks vacation and he kind of got off on telling how bad brother Branham was and how wrong he was so the church just told him said well why don't you just take off and don't come back I thought hey maybe somebody is waking up you know that you know so you consider what a person is saying you consider what they're teaching you see that away then you can depend upon it and consider it to her that it doesn't change we're in the times I said last week we're in a time of changing everything's changing right and some is good all right but when you talk about the word of God and you talk about a change who tells you where the change is at who is the one that would have the thought of the change and when to change all right see then Here Comes Paul being the one that would be used to write the basics of the New Testament until it's even in the scholarly terms it's called the paulinian Bible because that basically Paul is the writer of the New Testament scriptures you know more than anyone else and in all of his writings but yet he was the one that said Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever all right see then we should look at that and consider that he was the one that would have so much Authority until there in Galatians I believe it's 1 8 where he said if anybody come and preach anything contrary to what he'd preached let them be accursed now we quote him as saying what we want him to say you know but do we quote him as the truth was talking to a or what he was or what he is just Barbara's husband one day there and and he uh say oh I believe the Bible that's what you do he said yeah yeah I believe the Bible I thought for a minute I said in other words you believe what you want to you don't believe it's authentic do you well I don't believe in all he is I said well in other words you believe it's part authentic and you're the one to tell me what the authentic party is you know he kind of laughed at me because we get along real good but my point was where does it change and if it does change who knows the change who is the one that does the right to to change it you know I've always had trouble with the evolution Theory of how that do you you you should start off from a pollywog to a frog well who started to pollywog but you know I still have trouble even if the story was right that if we evolve down and come down to a monkey I agree we act like them but we still haven't turned back towards them you know and uh but see we're changing but God can't change you mean a God that would create mankind a God that would would create the world that he would know ever Nat that would ever bat its eyes or or whatever it would do be an omniscient and he'd know before the world all the things and if he doesn't then he's not God and see you take that Trinity concept and he said well the father knows so much the son knows so much and and the Holy Ghost knows so much and see you get it all confused and and understanding but think about it if he's the same yesterday today and forever all you got to do is find what he said 50 years ago they'd pull your toenails out and bleed your unit of blood when you're sick you think the doctors would agree to that today now there were some things that that would work right I mean because your your body as the redoing of the blood would bring forth and this nurse is sitting here that would tell you that would work in some cases but you got a guy with pneumonia and he's running 102 or three temperature and he's dying and then you're going to bleed him but we wouldn't agree with that today right because that would be contrary the we would agree today that here's people that are down so low we need to give them some blood me but yet see God is not that away the god I talk about the God I believe in you can follow him all the way through the Bible all the way through Jesus Christ the flesh coming on down and all the way through the Holy Ghost in our time and believing the word see then you don't have to worry about it you can make it to be where you can really understand him and that's a marvelous thing because as I said now if he changes who's got the right to tell you where it's at and who are we going to depend on what are we going to do but see I'm going to stay with the word to realize he can't change then if he can't change then I better watch and not try to change any of it myself I better follow that idea all right but I want to get a point to you today of an unchanging God and get it to you in a way to worth it you would would help us to understand the day and the hour that we're living now for some 45 years I've been preaching and when I started out preaching the first sermon I preached 1969 was that the Bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man on Earth reading it from the prophet bringing it from the message back there and showing that she would be the fullness of the godhead bodily that she would be the son of man but now we see everybody then say Oh no brother branham's the son of man no we don't agree with that brother random wasn't this other man the Lord Jesus Christ is the son of man but Iran was a prophet that God used which would be called a son of man see in the Old Testament it would say son of man prophesied and and God would speak through them you know and those prophets would say thus saith the Lord because it was God speaking through them to the people all right that's wonderful but it never made any of them almighty God none of those prophets would ever accept worship and even Jesus when he was on Earth at times they would try to worship Him and he'd accept it you watch the scripture read Matthew Mark Luke and John but then at other times when they would try to worship Him each time he said don't worship me because he could he knew what they were worshiping amen he knew they were worshiping the wrong thing even though they stood to say unless you believe that I am he you'll die in your sins but yet he wasn't putting himself he would say I and my father are one or he wasn't making himself greater in any form he was just trying to show who he was and what was going on but you think about it if he's the same yesterday today and forever then he would be the same in the law right the Old Testament he would be the same in flesh upon the Earth and being that he couldn't be something contrary to those Old Testament scriptures he said I come to do my father's will not his own all right see because that way he was not a taking any credit he said I do what the father shows me all right he said well that that means there's two of them well where's the other one out there if that's two of them so you take one scripture where he says unless you believe that I am he you'll die in your sins and then you say and Jesus said have I been so long with you Philip you didn't know me so if you've seen me you've seen the father all right but then just because he turned around and talk about a father who do you talk about who do you talk about I mean I'm sorry that's just the way I do things I'm just blunt playing I know but who do you pray to amen do you pray to the one inside of you or do you pray to the god of Heaven when it would have to be the same person but yeah we just don't turn around well I'm praying well I hadn't heard your words I'm talking to one inside of me yeah no see we recognize a father we recognize the Holy Spirit we recognize all of those the workings of the Lord because we have learned the truth of what it is God can change his form and appear in many different ways right but yet it's the same God all right see it was Christ back there that was the writing of the word all right come on it was Christ the writer one who's writing the word but yet as we were bringing out last week James says that Jesus Christ created all things no no no the father created well see where are you at in the word right you got somebody's concept instead of studying the Bible for yourself all right see then you don't believe in to be Hebrews 13 8. you believe in to be changing all right now come on down to where we're at we're not talking about organized religion that's out there we're talking about where Lula's at that all right I've tried for 45 years to preach one true and living God I tried to preach that used to sign yesterday today and forever and have held that thought all the way through no matter what all of these doctrines has come out well brother there you've always been right let's just put it plain who's been able to come tell me I was wrong you don't like that kind of talking do you but is it the truth I'm going to swallow your pride I don't have any because I give him the honor and glory for it all but after all of the doctrines and ideas of the message then they just don't come in here right why because they know we take a stand and like I said while ago praise God for that church if I get off of this message and start declaring how wrong the Bible is and how wrong this is and how wrong that you need to get rid of me right you need to get that out of there because there's got to be something wrong with it but when you can stand and say for 45 years these doctrines has not been able to impregnate us to the point and I've studied them all because I'm concerned about it and if nothing else I've studied it where I could talk to you about it and tell you where it was wrong at right because that was my job if I'm to rule over you and it's by the word that I bring then I need to know right all right and I don't come up here and say so and so say unless I heard that I've been always been killed at point you know that I've heard the people myself or whatever but yet we don't want people we don't want a preacher who can stand and say for 45 years I preach the same thing we'd rather have somebody that's been in this Doctrine and in that Doctrine and gone into that Doctrine and followed after this and run after all the chimney tales of the message and been in all the dates and the times and the seasons and the predictions and we'd rather have somebody doing that now somebody that can say for 45 years I've preached one time you know what that is to try to get you and I to a place that they can be a change of these bodies now where is it going to come from well the bus is going to pull up one of these days we're going to crawl on get out of here well I hope the bus hurry UPS because if not we're going to be in the nursing home or in the funeral home yeah well would you see church people don't want somebody that can stand and say show me where I'm wrong or if you get that challenge out on the internet show me where I'm wrong well you don't listen no I ain't gonna listen to silly I ain't got time to listen to silly stuff but you come and show me where that I'm off the message but see we don't want that because that's sarcasm well you know I mean my wife you know would be really I don't think she would would beat me over the head with a frying pan but if I come in the kitchen and started telling her how to cook she would let me know real quick that she's been at it ever since she's 12 years old because most of you know it 16 years old or about 15. she cooked me a meal invited me down and we were eating and I told her in front of her mother I said Miss cash you cook this supper because she can't cook it she said I'll let you know I didn't cook it well wouldn't it be something me coming there now what you need to do is you need to do this you need to do that you need to cook it this way how would you sisters like that right I mean you'd be tickled to death wouldn't you for your husband to come in and tell you no no no no no no no don't get off of it you'd say I've been at this all of my life and I've learned how to cook well I've been trying to preach one true and living God for 45 years and trying to get a church to realize who they are well there's anything wrong with me telling you that's what I've been huh any problems no but you see we don't get into the message and I told my wife I said and I know it'll take two services today at least or three or more on what I'm trying to get you to see but I want you to see one thing I've never de-christianized anybody I've never said anybody left the word when they left Lula you know because that's their business but I'm one that has never been one to try to run after people that has left because I didn't run after you to get you here right you came with your own accord well it's not my duty because somebody don't show up for a few services for me to go run them down to see what's wrong according to the Bible it says call for the elders if you're sick it didn't save the elders call you find out if you're sick I'm sorry I'm just not a pastor I guess he wants your lovey-dovey condo priest to call you and pet you well I'm sorry you know I'm just I'm not made that away I didn't get you in and I'm not going to beg you to come back but now if somebody leaves and they want to come and explain to me why they're leaving one brother that left you know back in quite a while ago he he told me he said I'll never do nothing to hinder in your church in any way do we go home in our life because he got home after a while you know what he said he said if anybody in Lulu wants to know why I left Lula let him call me and I'll tell them you know what one of these days I get them time I'm going to call him and ask him why he left you know go that's what he said he said if they want to know let them call me well I want to know because the day that I he left I said show me where I'm out the word well we'll go down to some quotes after a while or this afternoon you know that brother Brown said if your pastor is not preaching Hebrews 13 8 the same he said get away from me well now how can I be setting dates one week I'm preaching false doctrine of next week and running all over the country and doing all kinds of things and then says Hebrews 13 8. but you see church we don't look at things in the correct order and I pray that God will give me the understanding to express to you what I've tried to do because I've never de-christianized anybody for not believing what I believe you know my favorite saying is I don't make my wife believe what I believe I don't try to do that I don't try to get my kids to believe what I believe I don't get the grandkids to believe what I believe the great grandkids they're going to have their own salvation I try to preach when I believe you know I try to do that and I'm glad to talk to them about why did I believe it you know but I'm not trying to convince nobody because I can't do it I can't make you see the truth God knocked Paul down on the road to Damascus right it wasn't Peter or some of them out there knocking him off the horse getting him to listen God knocked him down see we need a revelation more than anything right when Revelation has to come from God's word well like I said we've been teaching stature perfect man Brother Moore was teaching it there in 1972 into 71 coming up and I asked a simple question I said how do we get these virtues about 1980 the Lord revealed to me how these virtues would come into being it would be through the opening of the word only through the opening of the word can these things come into being right God is not going to just open up our heads sister Gail and just pour things in Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God well then how can we hear without a preacher and how can he be preached unless what he'd be sinned well but you see I've tried to get you to understand and not de-christianize people because they don't believe what we believe you know why because one day you didn't believe what we believe you know what one day I didn't believe what we believe all right all right and we call it growth development brother Claude doesn't like progressive revelation because he said Progressive is not a good word finally the other day he'll hear that and he'll lie he admitted he said you got a right to say what you're saying about progressives the way you explain it you know because I believe that as little Sarah you know wouldn't it be something if the baby's born and then it is okay we got the baby put it in the bedroom we'll go back and see it in a couple of years from now you say that's silly is that the way we think in Christianity well you just get people saved well that's good that's wonderful but you know what you got to feed the baby you got to change his diaper you got to take it to the doctor you got to do all kind of things why cause you're raising the baby that's the way I look at Christianity I look at Christianity as a constant growth development because in the Old Testament when they had the man of falling which is an example of the word of God right when the Manna would fall they would try to hold some of that over till the next day and it was rotten on them they had to go out each day and gather that manna and fix it and eat it God is the type of the word of God that's why Jesus said I'm the bread that came down in the wilderness he wasn't no body back there it was the word that he was right all right see and that's why we burned the communion bread once it's dedicated and all we we burn it why because we're not trying to hold over all of those are examples and understanding but see I believe in in partial realization to perfect realization I believe that as a baby eats and grows you don't really don't think little Cyrus okay yesterday we was and we was drinking some um Jews that she'd give us and I looked over at Little Saver and I said boy would be good just in your old timers would understand but your new model stuff don't that you just say stick your finger in there and stick it in the baby's mouth oh that's unclean well you know we lived how many of you how many of you with your kids chewed their food for them a little bit before you gave it to him oh that's unsanitary we lived right you know but you see Church you don't give a stake we talk about that to a little baby you wait until it grows up when God does that in his word he doesn't expect us to know everything but he expects us after a while to begin to know a little bit I mean 45 years that we've been studying the word of God and some longer than that and especially internet people listening we ought to know a little bit about it you know see studying the Bible all of her life we ought to at least be coming somewhere do we get a a little concept of what it's talking about but you see church I've always tried to get you to see that there's people at different levels there's people at different levels in God everybody's not responsible everybody here today is not responsible for the same level of what we talk about you're responsible for your part and your part may be a greater level than mine I don't have no problem with that but you're responsible for your part I'm responsible for my part we're all responsible for growth development will growth development comes by eating right babies grow by eating all right and see in doing that we we don't consider things Peter said one day of Paul he said Paul says things hard to be understood and watch what he said he said in some wrestle you know in other words wrestle what he's what he's teaching to their own destruction he said why who's Paul think he is you may not got to listen to Paul well he said if you teach anything contrary to what I'm teaching he needs to let you be accursed now that was what he had to say about it well see we want Paul for what we won't hear right but we don't want the correction you know the Corinthians we don't want that we want the Bible for what we want as a beautiful picture oh yeah I believe that but now I don't believe what Paul's saying over here well now where does that right come from or do you understand what I'm getting at and then we'll get on to the point see because I believe that you you've got a lot of people in the world seven billion as they can record right now somewhere close to me even more you know out of that there's a lot of what we call Christian people and that's where people thinks that we're against the Baptist the Methodist the Presbyterian the Pentecostals the Catholics and the I'm not against anybody no well because they're people you know what you know whether we like it or not we all come off the same tree you know might be a lot of different branches but we're still off the same tree and no matter where black white yellow green brown or whatever it is we can all give each other a blood transfusion so we do have enough connections to be able to that I don't don't try to take blood from a dog it'll kill you you know because it's the wrong family all right see we can give each other blood transfusion because we're off of One Tree and see God then what I love about him when I was listening one day and I heard a prophet say because it always bothered me when I was back there in the Baptist I used to think about it we were missionary minded and to a degree and tried to help and uh you know I think about people in a foreign country or something that had never heard about Jesus Christ and I thought oh God what'll happen to that person well then one side would pull us up one preacher would be through and he said y'all are doing a good job giving you money and so y'all can't go so you know you're sending somebody else well that'd make you feel good you know then the other guy come in the next time and he'd say you need to be going you need to be a missionary you need to go and preach the gospel well that'd make you feel bad right you don't go with your human see both of them would be telling truth when I was listening one day and I heard the prophet he said that there'll be a heathen in the millennium and he said they'll be judged according to how they lived according to their own tribal laws and whatever the words you would use for that you know but their own tribal laws and things they'd be judged by he said here we are in America he said it'd be hard to go across the country in the choirs of America to find a half a dozen virgin women but he said you go to Africa the darkest of all continents where they don't even know right or left hand or don't even and don't even have clothes on there he said and they have to have a urgency test before they can marry and said if they don't pass the test they kill them he said what would happen in America he said there wouldn't be enough funeral homes to take care of all the dead but yet we call them heathen they don't know about Jesus they're heathen we yet they live a whole lot better life you say well it's only for fear okay praise the Lord you know I minded my mom one thing called I loved her but another thing I feared her amen I told you about it I told you about her whipping my brother with a metal ring off of a wooden barrel and ringing about that wide she stretch it out and with my brother when he was 18 years old because he said he's going to leave home she said go on but don't leave mats go in the house and sit down do you cool off then you can leave because you knew if he got in the house he wouldn't do it he said I'm leaving she just got that thing I can see her now stretched it out she wrapped him about twice of that thing he says if you'll leave me alone I'll go back in the house all right it might be fear of a tribe to keep it but it should be Christian fear right we're going to claim to be Christians there would be a Christian fear not afraid of being lost not afraid of a God that would would whip us or whatever don't teach your kids about a bad God come on be minor woman enough to give him a whooping oh but we can't do that now before I say we've fouled up you tell them kids about Jesus Christ but don't tell him he hates them don't even tell them God don't like for you to do that give him a weapon and tell them to stop it and I can't stand it you get in the store when there's a kid more they just fall on the floor start kicking and slobbering all over the place and crying I know what would have happened if I'd have done that and I know what happened when one of them done that I didn't have to whip them Nanny took care of him she believed in that if you you're going to spoil the child he's part of the rod but listen Church what am I talking about oh God that judges Everybody by their heart not by some Book of Rules even the Bible oh they're going to be judged by that Bible we're standing one day at my mother-in-law's house and a guy next door is cutting his grass on Sunday this lady standing there and said he's going to die and go to hell for that I thought man in the world how in the world could I ever talk to her about I mean God's gonna die and go to hell because he's cutting his grass on Sunday and we're going to get down in a little bit or maybe this afternoon we brought around talked about Eve and how that Eve's original sin was what oh now you can call it everything you want to but what was the original sin he said she didn't believe Hebrews 13 8. tonight wasn't written back dire God was back there and she didn't believe him to be the same to keep his words when he said the day you eat thereof that day you'll die she didn't believe it what is the biggest sin there is in the world that you could think of or to have you write it down on a piece of paper what is the biggest sin you could think of that guy up there that took a gun and killed how many kids was it in that school how many would write that down or Adolf Hitler that sent a world of war and millions was killed are here in the United States of a civil war that claimed more Americans than any War has ever done because of Americans on both sides blowing their legs off in their arms and their things and no medicine to do what would be your thought of the biggest sin could ever be a woman that would have bought a baby a person that would rob a bank or kill somebody we know all those things are bad that person they were talking about this morning to rape that 80 year old woman my Lord when there's so many women out there that's begging for a man what kind of what would be the greatest sin you could think of for Eve to disbelieve Hebrews 13 8. sin is unbelief drank and gambling smoking killing people blowing the world apart oh that's just attributes it's caused by the original sin when we get down to that then we always talk about what there is no little sin and it's no big sin right oh see any sin and I got just a little bit unbelief but these other people got plenty more well that makes you worse than they are because you know you only you got just a little bit you just trapped your own self see by saying I know I got a little bit of sin but these other people's got a whole lot more well you're not going to heaven whether or not or that man asked us the other day we were sitting up there eating with digging sister Gail and the guy came by and he said you know what are you going to how are you going to get to heaven brother dick thought he said how you gonna get to hell he said I said you got to be born again well I guess he'd never heard that because you know probably a Baptist I'm not saying nothing he would probably mean and saved that was his word you know be saved he probably never heard the word born again so remember it probably didn't think about enjoy just passed it kind of you know like I maybe don't understand what you're talking about wonderful guy nice guy right but you see I believe the only way to heaven is Jesus Christ you know what then that heathen that has never heard of Jesus Christ but yet bringing it down the way God looks at it that he gave him laws and rituals to follow and as he got that he will be judged by that so that is the word of God just as much as it is the King James version that we talk about of the Bible they won't be judged by whether Jesus Christ come into their life to save them but they'll be judged by their own actions and reactions what a wonderful God he doesn't demand all right but now when we move up into levels then demands come we preached it that and it's true that there is no thing about salvation is of the lord we believe that Jonah 2 and 9 it's wonderful and if you can't do nothing to get saved amen we believe that it's the grace of Jesus Christ but once you get born again and you claim Jesus Christ is living in you thank you now you've got some conditions I don't believe in Salvation with a condition right and I don't believe if you're truly born again you can never be lost but that's not the Baptist concept the urge is once saved always saved let me be true if it's truly saved if you truly have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your birth then you can't be lost right but it didn't don't put us just well I know that man I know I know he's been a bad guy all his life but he went to church when he was a kid see we want to put him in heaven because of some reason nobody's putting hell anymore have you heard a preacher lately get up and preach at that first land in front of them's gone to hell I always got some little reason well they painted the church they played the parking lot they gave two dollars an offering place oh that's well and good he said brother what are you talking about say I believe in a just honest true God that will judge everybody according to what you've heard that way he won't judge everybody that hasn't heard the truth by Earth Our Truth he'll judge him by what truth they have now we're not talking about being the bride of Christ because we've been through that we know the story when we're talking about a born-again Believer as being a person who has received the baptism of the Holy Ghost like they did on death Pentecost or we believe in that and we believe that is to be the bride of Christ but what about the foolish virgins and the different people who have never heard what are you going to do about the Old Testament people that never heard about Jesus Christ come on but they witnessed the Christ as the pillar of fire the one who led the children of Israel they witnessed Christ as he was there in doing all of those things and we'll be judged according to that so get what I'm saying where I can back up and do it I believe a born-again experience puts you a place to where you're in the body of Christ and that's what Jesus was talking about it's when he said unless you be born again you cannot see you cannot understand the kingdom speaking to the most religious person in the world Amen the most honorable respectable Nicodemus the teacher the Bible called him but yet he couldn't understand when Jesus would speak of the new birth he said well all he had to do was believe that's good old Baptist thoughts and all the Nicodemus had to do is believe what do you mean he put his life on the line for his job everything was on the line if they found him there he would have been high priest no longer everybody was right teacher he put everything on the line to get to talk to Jesus see we look at the world and we think about well what about it well I look at it too and I ask you what about the world what is all this world going to be judged by it's got to be judged by something called as a human being so then the judgment is going to be up on an individual basis that we be judged according to what we've heard and what we walk in he said well brother Dale what do you think I believe that you must be born again to do that you must be justified by Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ and asking him to forgive your sins and you know what when he does forgive you you'll never answer for them they're gone those won't meet your judgment you may for a lot more but that won't because that's gone because he's honest and are just God when you say father forgive me he says okay I forgive you I believe in sanctification which is a deeper work or talk which is really not a word because there's no work of the Salvation of God it's a deeper deeper different talk and that sanctification sets you aside cleanses you corrects your life in doing but I wish you would think about it a little here's one person sitting here he said well I don't do the things I used to do here's another person I don't do the things I used to do but I don't do what that person is doing now see you've become judge instead of listening to the heart of the individual trying to get down to simple terminologies for us to think about something and we're going to talk about Hebrews 13 8 we've got to be able to put him in the word right right you know there's people that have asked God to forgive them and he's forgive them sure you know there'll be people in heaven that are not as we call it born again here because you got your foolish virgins you've got all of your other groups now how are you going to get them there I like to see that well you just don't understand when they're good to the bride well praise the Lord but a lot of them didn't never know the bride laughs amen I'm trying to get you to see Hebrews 13 8 like you've never seen it before and then you'll see why for 45 years and some of you have been here for 40. and you'll know and understand what I've been doing I've been trying my best to get you and I to a place to see Jesus Christ for our own selves yeah not to see him as a group collectively but to have our own personal experience then all together around the world the bride of Christ can be the fullness of the godhead bodily she can beat the son of man all together but not one person but a random couldn't be the fullness but a random couldn't be the sort of man brother random wooden almighty God come on we don't believe in the junk we believe the truth but think about it see we're constantly judging people by our own bushel of apples as we call it right that's a old saying amongst us Southern you know don't judge my bush on apples by your rotten apple now you know what happens to that you you take a bushel of apples the whole time someone's old enough to raise some potatoes and you you take potatoes and you put them up and and you you fix them and and they're wonderful to eat later but yet you put a rotten one in there and it not only rottens that rotten wrong out it rottens everything around it so that's what he's talking about an apple you know you put a barrel of Apple together you put one rotten apple in the middle of it it's going to run the whole barrel for long so don't judge right people by what you think let God be the judge in other words we bring to people will judge them right the life we live the mannerism as we read in Hebrews the way we live and I will judge the world you sisters wearing a dress out will judge the world why because the world out there don't believe in wiring them like that so they're going to have to change the sign down at the restroom yeah you know right you know we sent symbols up to the outer space back a long time ago in you know back then the women had dresses long hair and clothes on and the men had pants and shirts and things you know their hair cut off and we put them in these little cubicles and send them to outer space just in case there's somebody out there well what if it come down now what if those people come down well we sent them 40 years ago right come on you see what I'm talking about don't you you see how we're deteriorating and falling apart they were losing all femininity and masculinity until now you can't tell who's who but then you got the women walking around right come on why is it in your you're in the day now when all women wants to operation house would it be nice you know to make everything look bigger well I thought the man spoke out of the chest yeah you're Taylor go ahead at least your life later how do you remember it and make a good point but listen how is God going to judge seven billion people that are alive today and the comparison of how many trillions of trillions of trillions that have been in the world how's he going to judge him and how is he going to judge the trillions of them that was before Jesus Christ right see we've got the ideas and it is because Jesus Christ paid for the sins of those back there as well as over here that's why he held out his arms they were stretched out to where it would take the old and the new and he would stand between law and Grace yeah we just think about Grace a major statement there the other weekend here and a brother asked me later about it he said I explained it he said God I'm bad to just say things and thank you supposed to understand and I'm sorry I'm just getting old and that's but yet you ought to understand but listen is the world going to be judged by your ideas or is it going to be judged by the word of God so we find in the word of God that there's people going to be in heaven that are not as we say born again that are not in the times of Jesus Christ never heard the gospel right well I'm a firm believer brother Dale you got to be born again but I agree with you we need to be now we'd have to determine what you mean by burned again that's why people can't read brother Branham and follow him he said you say you accept Jesus Christ as your savior he said then you have eternal life they can't handle themselves or he could say like adoption I can prove that you're born again and then baptized into the body and I'll wrote around his message we'll get to that more this afternoon so we put a they put everybody gets in a category we look at them today as we see Baptists here at Methodist here at Presbyterian here Pentecost was here and you say why are you putting them out like that because each one of those groups believe you must belong to their group right now they don't make it that you've got to belong to us to be saved you know they're kind of getting away from that but back in my day if if you as a Baptist you you didn't go to a Methodist Church you know and I've tried to tell you about the Baptists if people don't believe it but you're going to try it no matter how many times you've been baptized father son Holy Ghost if you'll be baptized 40 times when you go to the Baptist Church you're going to get baptized one more time because they're not going to let you come in their Fellowship until you're baptized in their Fellowship you can go from a Baptist to a Methodist Church they don't require you to get be re-baptized but you go from any church to a Baptist you're going to be baptized again if you don't believe it go ask them let's see Church God has a way of getting a lot of people to heaven he's a wonderful God he's a loving God see hell was made for the devil and his angels wasn't made for people right we go to hell we go over the blood of Jesus Christ but can you understand and not look at everybody that tries to make everybody in your cubicle you're you're a little tall your idea your concept of something you know yourself people will tell you in a heartbeat most everybody especially young converts if you don't believe this message you're gonna die and go to hell well now I won't run around them for that and we talk about he was a prophet I want you to read where he says that you see church I'm trying to get you and I to see one thing break down off of our intellectual talks and Concepts and get down to true Christianity there's going to be people in heaven that never didn't even know about Jesus Christ and there's going to be maybe a lot of us in hell that's been our whole life serving what we thought was him but you know there won't be no Escape at that day there won't be no changing run around made an outstanding statement one day he said you can call him Jesus Jesus and worship the devil right what about it don't judge everybody I've never done it but yet for 45 years I've tried to progressively ever what you want to call that word growing in Grace and knowledge amen knowing that everything and I said well I preach everything to you I start off at a partial realization any doctrinal issue that I bring I start at the lowest I can bring it of a partial realization of that and going to the Heights and the greater depths of all things because I said how do we get these virtues well I just need them I got to have them so I got them Like Richard when he came down he said I never heard nobody say that they was required I said I didn't say that brother random did he said they're required but you see we want to base Christianity Upon Our Own concept instead of thinking about the rest of the world that's why you've never seen me ridiculed denominations do nothing one brother Brown said the problem was he said I'm not against the people he said I'm against the system right what is the system doctrines ideas of mankind as to some way to be saved well you don't want us to be good I think that's a moral obligation as a human being is to be good whether you're born again or whether you're a Hindu to who Do's or whatever you are if everybody in the world had a sensible partner listen to their inward being of a moral con you know moral part of them of their soul they wouldn't be so much killing around the world but see how much are we killing if you don't believe the way I believe you're out yeah well you know what if God now I make this statement I won't call the name because I've tried to get away from them because I've made some statements people told me they said I didn't say that so I'm going to try to get away from saying who said it but this brother one day said he was talking about him and said brother random said brother he said from word that person is down there to you something converted he said that person's low and you're higher what he said from where you are to where I am he said did a whole lot of higher depth what he said from where he is to where I am is a whole lot higher depth you see we think that Well everybody's got to believe this message go to heaven because that's what we've been taught you know they ever doctrines there is and been taught by some mankind or now woman kind because they got the women in the pulpits now but listen Church what does it mean how is everybody going to get to heaven what's what's going to heaven me and my wife and Joe and his wife and that's four no more is that right why have you got 969 different denominations right the Baptist wants everybody to be Baptist and that's just wants everybody to be mad the Presbyterian wants everybody to be president during the Catholic wants everybody to be Catholic right the brand of mine said we're among they want everybody to be brown much then you got this group that believes this Doctrine and this group believes that Doctrine and if you don't believe that Doctrine you're lost I told the brother when he's going to Jeffersonville one time years ago I said you're going to run into some fun you get up prayer he didn't know what I meant they got there he got out walked down through there and this person come on said no paraphrase it could have been a long time but said you believe right around was God first thing the person said I mean but you know what that man believed brother was God well he's going to die and go to hell believe in that what's the difference in that and your thoughts Two Souls Two Lords seven Thunder virtues proves et cetera et cetera et cetera come on let's get off of all that let's let's get down to Lula ochs okay you know Lula ice you know that's where we live you know a lot of people now introduce us as Lula ice because I've said that so much what do we think what is your idea of of a salvation what is your idea of an ending of all things what is your idea of what's going to cause a Rapture to come in Lula Georgia I've told you my idea I've told you what I believe we talk about a change of the body there is no change of the body outside the reveal word of God it's this message revealed to you and I that will walk off this Earth in that message but we're all going to be at the same level we're not responsible for the same level our education limits us to this to that the other education brother doesn't want to do with salvation come on it has something to do with your human abilities maybe to express what you believe or whatever but it still has that but are we all on the same level when the Bible said I'm God and I change not and he says Hebrews 13 8 said he's the same yesterday today and forever come on you Justin think about it what is your concept of Christianity or your thoughts and you'll see why that people don't want this message why because it's been made a book of rules it's been made of human cons cious of someone we first came in this message years ago it was all around Gainesville and I'm not throwing off on nobody because I don't told you where I stand but you could say brown them out and they'd say oh that's bunch of people looking around and come back the tent and go across country that was the concept that people had there was a concept of the world at least the Badness you said what about the right well they believe in going to heaven they believe you need to be born again but what is the Lula ice and what is the the people that believe well it's got to be this it's got to be that's got to be this got to be that what if God don't take it exactly the way we judge it you don't think I have a right to think I didn't say you didn't have a right to think I said we if we're going to think we're supposed to think of Hebrews 13 8. that he's the same yesterday today and forever and to treat everybody that away and to look at everybody with that understanding but you know what most people do they look the witness in the Bible there when two of them was praying one on one side said Lord I thank you I fast and I pray and I do these things and said Lord I'm not like that fella over there on the other side of the praying I do this and I do that we know he's telling the truth he didn't do it right sure or he'd have been lying and he wouldn't lie before God so he was telling the truth he didn't do anything but on the other side was water man said Lord just forgive me now which one do we want to be he said well you sound like that you don't believe in being good I don't believe in being good I believe in being born again I believe in letting Jesus Christ come and live in our hearts and our soul and then that's the goodness of anything is Christ Living in US and then how much stronger do I believe that we must find the word of the hour that you and I are living and walk in that word because that's what I've been preaching 45 years what to try to get people to see we have to become the message living in you and I not just talk about it not as a book of rules or doing but a revelation of Jesus Christ to see Christ Living in our hearts and lives but you see we've got our own concept like I tell you about the man up in Canada that time that God spoke to his heart when he's riding down the road and there's a prostitute walking down the street what would you do and how would you judge that he pulled over to the window rolled it down and said how much is the cost for your time she tells him the cost he gives her the money she gets in the car he said I don't want your body I want to talk to you about your soul God spoke to me to try to talk to you about your soul you know what she got born again my wife and wife would look for me seeing me riding around with a prostitute I asked my wife a question many years ago I said honey I didn't live a good life like you did and I'm sorry she said I don't understand how you can look and see people that you were in life with I said don't a question I want to ask you I said if that person come to church started Living For Christ could you put your arms around them and say I love you in Christ because now we're sisters she said yes I saw like a no four questions no more thoughts you see she had the right attitude let's stand what do we got anybody have a need the altar's open we're going in the name of Jesus Christ we send his prayer cloth our sister Lord she's tired today weary we ask you to just take that away from him when her brother gets home let everything be well and all done we love you in Jesus name anybody else see one day you'll see that all I've tried to bring Jesus Christ to you to get you to want Christ to live in your heart and be a Christian Lord Jesus you've heard our sister an unspoken request we just lay hands up on her believing that you'll take care of all things we love you and we thank you made it to you now in Jesus name anybody else see do you know Jesus Christ you really know him are you just a religious Pharisee I know spirit's still here a judgment Spirit of people looking down your nose at somebody else or do you have Jesus Christ you know that salvation eternal life is the only thing really you want to give away he said give it away no you can't just the way of saying it we try our best to give salvation to people but how do we do it what's your manner of conversation watch their life Paul was saying whoever rule over you watch their life what's your doings see if the end of their conversation is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever make me ever maybe that's why some of our kids don't want this message some maybe that's why grandkids or something don't want this message come on I've challenged you how many of you never went home and say kids grandkids or what I'm sorry for the life I live forgive me you ever done that no I've done the best I could do you lying hypocrite just remember somebody else is looking down make me ever true think about him my heart our sister said their daughters come on her mind today we pray that you would go there and touch and whatever it be whatever the trouble is that you take care of it so we believe you father and we love you in Jesus name amen amen anybody else before we go mold me just saying that to one another as you're leaving to think about the service this afternoon and remember what I said somebody stops want to talk to you and we'll talk outside you say praise the Lord I love you God bless you but don't get in a conversation because it'll it messes up all right if you're dismissed change my heart father just be with everybody take care of everybody Lord let your love be with us in Jesus name
