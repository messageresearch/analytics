[0:00] that's correct
[0:06] all right
[0:10] we're going to read finish reading some
[0:13] that we were reading last week on
[0:14] brotherly kindness
[0:16] together
[0:35] good afternoon
[0:38] hello
[0:42] there we go all right you gotta know yep
[0:45] okay
[0:48] let's get back to Statue of a perfect
[0:51] man
[0:52] and let's read this
[0:54] and then make some comments on it
[0:56] because we we gotta mold this from
[0:59] brotherly kindness right up into and
[1:02] next week try to try to go over that
[1:05] green
[1:06] I didn't want to get maybe it was the
[1:08] Lord not letting me get the dream until
[1:09] you got to get to the very part where it
[1:12] says holy spirit because that brother
[1:14] Ram said that was the honey so you gotta
[1:16] understand what the honey is
[1:19] to understand what that Holy Spirit is
[1:21] right here
[1:22] not a different Holy Ghost than you
[1:24] receive right right not a different one
[1:27] but it is a different manifestation of
[1:29] that Holy Spirit this puts you in the
[1:31] body this didn't put you in the body
[1:35] you're in the body here you're not
[1:37] putting the body twice right right
[1:38] you're putting a body down here at Faith
[1:41] you're a Christian you're a Believer
[1:42] you're you're born again you're bride
[1:45] all right but God don't want you to stay
[1:47] baby this is baby down here this is baby
[1:49] faith this is not Babyface this is
[1:52] mature faith
[1:54] right this is God working in Paul Peter
[1:58] James if you want to see what you want
[2:00] to see what the real acts of the holy
[2:01] spirit is it's supposed to be in the end
[2:03] time go to the book of Acts and see what
[2:06] the faith of the fathers which is right
[2:07] here
[2:08] the faith of the promise which was Paul
[2:10] Irene called
[2:12] Peter James Paul all the all the
[2:14] disciples and the apostles that were
[2:16] living in that first church action all
[2:17] right so that's the characteristics of
[2:20] what we have to get to and it's like
[2:22] brother Brown you know we we went back
[2:24] and he showed that that the true Act of
[2:28] Brotherly kindness was there in the book
[2:29] of Acts when everybody sold everything
[2:31] gave it to one head and then they
[2:34] distributed it and there was no
[2:35] grumbling because the only two that
[2:37] grumbled died
[2:40] okay I don't know since so far the only
[2:42] two that grumbled about the whole
[2:43] situation they died
[2:45] so God got rid of them in a hurry
[2:49] God may not physically kill us now but
[2:51] definitely
[2:53] people are spiritually dying which is
[2:55] worse
[2:56] then sexually let's add the Bible saying
[2:59] here adding Brotherly Love brotherly
[3:01] kindness and that's a good one right
[3:03] here the six seven all right adding
[3:05] brotherly kindness all right when we get
[3:07] to that brotherly kindness put yourself
[3:08] in this place
[3:10] on the matter now you're saying my
[3:13] brother sinned against me said Peter
[3:14] shall I forgive him he said seven times
[3:16] a day
[3:17] Jesus said 70 times seven all right
[3:21] 490 times yeah
[3:25] seven times what's good
[3:27] but not that one it's
[3:30] 490 times
[3:33] probably kindness now you see it for
[3:34] Brothers All Out Of Tune don't be
[3:37] impatient with it I remember what we
[3:38] said excuse me last Sunday
[3:40] brotherly kindness to me brings in all
[3:44] the virtues because you've come invited
[3:47] that one more time we'll throw this
[3:48] thing
[3:49] oh that's temperature
[3:51] I just want to see if somebody
[3:56] but brotherly kind of spreads an all
[3:58] together patient hey everything because
[4:00] it culminates right here is where the
[4:02] ceiling in is going to be of the virtues
[4:05] all right so you come up to brotherly
[4:07] kindness you better have all these
[4:09] working because somewhere down in here
[4:11] you're going to know whether you got
[4:12] brotherly kindness or not or I mean up
[4:14] here you're going to know what you got
[4:15] brother kinds because of what's what he
[4:17] says right here someone said not long
[4:19] ago how can you believe these things you
[4:21] do and still go the Assembly of God in
[4:22] one it's all the rest
[4:24] then put see brotherly kindness see see
[4:27] hoping someday patient with him
[4:30] temperate knowledge to understand what
[4:33] he believed remembers in his heart
[4:34] virtue he's named pretty much all the
[4:37] virtues below that
[4:40] having faith that someday God will bring
[4:42] him in
[4:43] okay
[4:45] brother Reynolds and brotherly kindness
[4:47] and he's tapped on the chalkboard
[4:49] all right
[4:57] see that he goes back and then he jumps
[4:59] right in and says next thing he says add
[5:00] charity the Capstone
[5:04] he's talking about the why not get into
[5:06] the
[5:07] uh brother Dale's been speaking of Enoch
[5:11] been the Zodiac coming and Enoch was a
[5:14] pyramid
[5:17] come out to Pyramid Navy
[5:19] of course when he drew the picture he
[5:21] had to put when he drew that picture he
[5:24] had to put
[5:27] something behind it to show that pyramid
[5:29] was something to deal with and then he
[5:31] talks about the dollar and he talks
[5:32] about the pyramid like they said there
[5:34] is a pyramid teaching that's totally off
[5:37] the wall but there is parts of that
[5:38] pyramid that was if Enoch built that
[5:41] pyramid according to the Bible
[5:45] then they are something about the stones
[5:47] there is something about the the the
[5:49] placing of the rooms and the seven steps
[5:52] and the three chambers and the upside
[5:54] down there's all something to do with
[5:56] that but it's all in a type of me and
[5:58] you it was it was not a reality God
[6:00] didn't want to live in a pyramid right
[6:03] but he did there wasn't enough word and
[6:06] actually there wasn't enough that any of
[6:07] us weren't there
[6:09] you'll make that manifest so we're here
[6:12] now looking back and we can see the
[6:14] pyramid teaching
[6:16] and we say that is it's okay it's all
[6:20] right to study it and look at it I
[6:22] really enjoyed that brother Clark did an
[6:24] in-depth study on it and he showed that
[6:26] that pyramid you know it looks all
[6:28] Jagged but when it was first built it
[6:31] was built with the stones and then there
[6:33] was casing stones that were polished and
[6:36] they were put on the outside of that
[6:38] pyramid so the pyramid was slick and
[6:40] when the sun come up it radiated the
[6:42] sunlight out and it supposedly you could
[6:45] see it for two three hundred miles all
[6:47] right there's no Shadow either that's it
[6:49] that's amazing that it was
[6:51] geographically put where there was no
[6:53] Shadow to me I don't I don't know I
[6:56] don't see I can't see how that happened
[6:57] with the sun coming up and the thing
[6:59] would be sticking up like this there's
[7:00] got to be something but you have to go
[7:02] about what they say but the thing that
[7:04] got me was is there's exactly 144
[7:09] 000 that man from that number familiar
[7:11] there's exactly 144
[7:14] 000 casing stones
[7:16] in that pyramid
[7:18] and they were tore off during the years
[7:20] and dispersed in all over the world well
[7:23] guess what same thing with the Jews
[7:26] they were dispersed all out there's 144
[7:30] 000 going to come back and they're not a
[7:32] total part of this pyramid but they do
[7:34] get the Holy Ghost
[7:35] okay
[7:37] they do get the Holy Ghost I mean they
[7:38] don't have to come up the pyramid like
[7:40] we do but they do get the Holy Ghost the
[7:42] same holy ghost that we get all right so
[7:44] that was kind of strange but it wasn't
[7:47] strange knowing that 144 000 is going to
[7:50] be saved and that all that 144 000
[7:52] casing Stones were done away with and to
[7:55] keep to bring the pyramid back you're
[7:57] gonna have to bring them 144 000 back so
[7:59] that's good
[8:03] all right let's go on up a little bit
[8:04] further
[8:05] you don't like the pyramid now look I
[8:08] got 328.
[8:10] sorry it's hot in here but
[8:13] nobody thought of it now in the building
[8:16] the virtue of building this Monument
[8:17] building this stature now remember it's
[8:20] not a statue
[8:23] little words mean things it's not a
[8:25] statue a statue is you can't move a
[8:29] statue a statue has no virtue noise
[8:31] temper so statue is just a statue but a
[8:34] stature is high or growth development
[8:36] and you read your Bible your Bible will
[8:39] tell you
[8:41] stature of a perfect man okay building
[8:44] this Monument building this stature
[8:46] Scene It starts off with the foundation
[8:48] stone Faith virtue and all this temp for
[8:50] the face of Godless public kindness now
[8:52] what does it do then you're waiting for
[8:56] the headstone which is love for God is
[8:58] love and he controls and he is the
[9:00] strength of every one of these things
[9:01] that's right yes sir
[9:03] right in here right in here see I got in
[9:05] between all these Works in here little
[9:08] waves now in the original chart and we
[9:10] had one a long time ago I don't know if
[9:11] Daddy still got one or not but in the
[9:13] original chart there is waves coming
[9:15] right down through here brother Brown
[9:17] Road in the original chart there's waves
[9:19] coming up there
[9:20] okay now what he explained was he said
[9:23] the holy ghost coming down through
[9:25] Christ seeing holy spirit so what it
[9:28] comes to is you bring now the holy
[9:30] spirit is above all this welding this
[9:32] together
[9:33] building a what a perfect church for the
[9:36] Capstone and cap at all so the church is
[9:37] going to be perfect before the cap comes
[9:39] on the cap doesn't come on to make it
[9:42] perfect the cat comes on to make it
[9:45] complete right right everybody
[9:46] understand that the cap comes on to make
[9:49] it complete not to make it perfect
[9:51] being perfect is when this comes right
[9:53] here and it takes and if there's any
[9:56] cracks it's silver
[9:58] okay so I mean we still may have we
[10:00] still got a problem even with a Capstone
[10:02] you got a problem
[10:04] yeah about complete and all right watch
[10:09] this right here the holy spirit is above
[10:11] all this welding This Together building
[10:12] a perfect church for the Capstone to cap
[10:16] it off so it's got to be a perfect
[10:19] Church show the Capstone can come on
[10:21] because the Capstone is perfection that
[10:25] is Jesus Christ himself
[10:27] okay that's that's what we mean that's
[10:30] what the world has missed and it's only
[10:32] happened two times in history and I
[10:35] believe that we've got you know we've
[10:36] got to all come to that if we're going
[10:38] to come to the body change but brother
[10:40] Brown and Lord Jesus Christ were the two
[10:43] greatest examples of being a perfect man
[10:46] and then that Capstone coming down on
[10:48] top of it which is adoption this is not
[10:51] adoption from here to here this is
[10:54] adoption
[10:56] got it The Headstone is adoption not all
[11:00] these others sure there's a lot of times
[11:02] you can be heard God will expect you to
[11:05] do things he will say this is my beloved
[11:08] Son in whom I'm pleased as well but he
[11:10] will not say here you him until that
[11:12] Divine love
[11:14] or perfect love
[11:17] comes down on that perfect church or
[11:19] perfect person
[11:21] um not a good little brother brown but
[11:23] it
[11:26] was in last week brother Brandon okay if
[11:29] brother Brandon came to that Capstone
[11:31] why did he not take a body chain because
[11:34] he was a prophet of the age and the
[11:37] prophet of the age he prophesied himself
[11:41] brother Brown said they can't be two of
[11:43] us here at the same time
[11:45] so guess what
[11:46] brother Brown I'm wanting God but God is
[11:49] God
[11:51] so he prophesied his own death he knew
[11:53] that he knew I believe he knew it a
[11:55] while he was going to have to leave yeah
[11:57] the reason he had to leave is because of
[12:00] that
[12:01] because God said I'll not share my glory
[12:03] with nobody I'm going to come and campus
[12:04] they want no there wasn't no two or
[12:06] three jesuses on the earth at one time
[12:08] and all there was one Jesus
[12:10] he was the prophet he was the man he
[12:13] that wasn't no other savior there wasn't
[12:15] no other Redeemer he's the only one
[12:17] and brother Branham understood that
[12:19] headship and he said okay I'm here
[12:22] because remember
[12:23] listen to what the angel said on the
[12:26] river the angel said on the river your
[12:29] message will forerun he didn't say you
[12:32] will he never says you will forerun he
[12:35] says your message will forerun the
[12:37] second coming of Jesus Christ so brother
[12:39] random knew I don't believe he knew
[12:41] there on the river but as he got older
[12:43] in his in his walk with God he knew that
[12:46] there was a point in time that he was a
[12:47] prophet so he prophesied things and
[12:50] those who prophesy must die because
[12:52] they're prophesying of someone to come
[12:54] all right
[12:56] because the great one came then me and
[12:59] you have to come
[13:01] we weren't there
[13:02] The Headstone can't come down on a total
[13:05] body like we were talking about last
[13:06] night until everybody comes to their
[13:08] place
[13:09] okay everybody's wanting to find the
[13:12] last one
[13:13] well the last one may be sitting in a
[13:15] church for 10 years and not be born
[13:17] again but all of a sudden when that
[13:19] brother or sister gets born again it's
[13:21] done
[13:22] because you can walk in sanctification
[13:24] for you know years years and years and
[13:26] years okay everybody got that
[13:29] so brother Branham came to adoption
[13:32] because I believe that's the only way
[13:34] the seals could break because Jesus
[13:35] preached the seals they broke he
[13:37] preached six seals they broke to them to
[13:39] him not no one else
[13:41] then you had brother Brown come and when
[13:43] he came
[13:44] the seals were broke to him when he went
[13:46] out to Arizona now the seals went broke
[13:48] to him out there
[13:49] but God identified where he was
[13:54] when he said in other words this is my
[13:57] beloved Son in whom I pleased to dwell
[13:59] hear ye him because he told Brother
[14:01] around me he said go back to
[14:02] Jeffersonville it'll be revealed to you
[14:04] those seals see they didn't reveal him
[14:06] nothing to him out in Arizona right that
[14:08] was just a scene
[14:10] that was just a scene those angels
[14:13] didn't tell him nothing listen those
[14:14] angels couldn't tell him anything
[14:16] everybody wants to think that the
[14:18] seventh one was him and the sixth one
[14:20] was was Luther Western none of them
[14:23] people knew a thing about even brother
[14:25] Brown from that point back didn't know
[14:27] one thing about the seal
[14:29] right I said not one thing
[14:32] and I meant when I called the book
[14:34] closed
[14:35] sure you could look to a glass Darkly
[14:37] you could see and prophesy of something
[14:39] to come but that bug was in the hands of
[14:42] the original owner not William Brown
[14:44] right right it was in God's hands and
[14:47] the only one who could open the book
[14:48] brother Brown said the only one who can
[14:49] open the book is a lamb okay
[14:52] but we know the lamb was in brother
[14:54] Branham just like the Lambs in you
[14:57] okay the Lamb's in you the same as it
[14:58] was in brother Reynolds but he fulfilled
[15:00] an office
[15:02] an office that was fulfilled that
[15:05] that you know he said he changed my life
[15:06] and it did because I see that then he
[15:09] saw I see that he saw that was when his
[15:12] message really started and he tells you
[15:14] many times he said it's not in the Years
[15:16] this is years of preparation
[15:18] that's right yeah everybody say that
[15:21] this is this is a year from from the
[15:23] Holy Spirit down to Faith that is the
[15:26] 2000 year preparation from when Jesus
[15:29] the Capstone was here he was the
[15:31] Capstone but remember he can't cap the
[15:34] church because you and I weren't there
[15:37] he's got to have that end time bribe
[15:39] that's why I said that that Abram can
[15:42] live all the way up through here I hope
[15:43] some you got that maybe we want to do it
[15:44] again because I some of you didn't
[15:46] understand just thought it was a good
[15:47] story but Abram
[15:49] Abram come up through here Abram walked
[15:53] through justification sanctification
[15:54] Matthew in the morning he told Abram to
[15:56] walk before me and be thou perfect
[15:58] that's right did you know
[16:00] not Abraham he said Abram walk before me
[16:03] and be perfect
[16:04] when he got his name changes when
[16:06] everything honed down
[16:08] to where Abraham knew what was going to
[16:12] happen who it was going to be by and
[16:14] when
[16:15] because remember God said I'll visit you
[16:18] according to the time of life so he knew
[16:19] according to the time of the cycle of
[16:21] the woman in the time of the nine-month
[16:24] pregnancy he knew within that nine
[16:25] months he was fixing to produce that
[16:27] child and he was going to produce it to
[16:29] Sarah so he had it wasn't
[16:32] it went and follow us on Holy Ghost uh
[16:36] baptism it wasn't you know eternal hell
[16:38] you see what I'm saying
[16:40] Abram may have been caught up in a lot
[16:42] of that but Abraham was not Abraham
[16:45] finally knew okay I'm going to have this
[16:47] child by Sarah promised child
[16:50] and my name's been changed to Abraham so
[16:53] I'm a different person something's going
[16:55] to happen because at 99 I can't do it
[16:59] so he knew at the point and that's why I
[17:03] believe brother Branham he he comes on
[17:04] the spoken words Original season which
[17:06] is pretty simple what 62. and he says
[17:10] the pure unadulterated word struck the
[17:12] Earth
[17:14] he thought
[17:16] it had from their back
[17:19] the period but the message because
[17:22] remember the Holy Ghost said pick up
[17:23] your pen and write as of yeah Malachi
[17:26] Force he broke around thought he'd
[17:27] already fulfilled those and he preached
[17:29] the seals as he thought he preached he
[17:31] preached took the Loose Ends and tied
[17:33] them all together no eternal hell water
[17:35] baptism what happened in the garden all
[17:37] the doctrines that we that we continue
[17:39] to go you know we over and over we talk
[17:41] about
[17:42] but see that's just years of preparation
[17:46] listen that just got the church
[17:50] back to where Paul was
[17:53] you understand that that just got the
[17:55] church it had fell away so much through
[17:58] the church ages right here Church ages
[18:00] it had been eaten so much to the church
[18:02] ages of man's ideas Mass doctrine that
[18:05] brother Brown remember the Alpha and
[18:07] Omega He restored the faith of the
[18:09] fathers which was in the first church
[18:12] but that wasn't brother Brown's message
[18:14] but he had to bring that message
[18:16] so that this
[18:20] welding this together he had to build a
[18:23] perfect Church it didn't mind if it was
[18:25] only one that was him
[18:26] he had to build a perfect church and so
[18:29] the Capstone could come on top of it
[18:31] brother Brown at that point
[18:34] if he preached a wild horse rider was
[18:36] the Holy Ghost that was error God
[18:38] corrected it and from then on it was
[18:40] pure everybody got that right
[18:44] so he came to bring the pure message the
[18:46] perfect message
[18:47] and a lot of people they don't they they
[18:49] they they they're wrong when they do
[18:52] this when they say oh 47 to 63 he was so
[18:55] wrong can't believe him but after 63. no
[18:58] sure we had levels of understanding from
[19:01] 47 to 63. that was he was growing in
[19:04] Grace and now it's just like you and I
[19:05] do
[19:06] but when you come to 1963 sure God
[19:09] sharpened that pencil of that Prophet
[19:11] because you come up to here
[19:15] and brother Brown says okay I was this
[19:17] was wrong I was thinking this I was
[19:19] thinking that all during that seals that
[19:21] week what God was doing God was just
[19:23] remember
[19:25] Michelangelo when he got when he got to
[19:28] Moses he wasn't finished when he got
[19:30] finished
[19:31] he still had to polish it because there
[19:33] were some rough edges on it right right
[19:35] you still have to when you build
[19:37] anything build cabinets or anything you
[19:39] build these cabinets
[19:40] you put them out and you say well that's
[19:42] done no you got to sand them
[19:44] Barney some paint them so the finishing
[19:46] touches have not been put on the body
[19:52] brother Branham come his message from 47
[19:54] to 63 did bring
[19:58] a stature yes
[20:01] to here yes right
[20:04] that's what it brought it brought back
[20:06] the faith of the fathers remember
[20:08] Malachi 4 says restore the heart
[20:11] of the children to the fathers in other
[20:14] words the children The Babylon
[20:15] Pentecostal baby children 1906 Isuzu
[20:19] Street he brought that group of people
[20:22] well he didn't bring back I'm not coming
[20:24] individuals I'm talking about they
[20:25] probably want nobody understood what he
[20:27] said but it was for you and I
[20:30] that had come out of Pentecost our
[20:32] Baptist our Methodist or whatever you
[20:34] want to say we had to come out come into
[20:35] this message and then from 47 to 63 is
[20:38] your foundation but it's not just a
[20:40] foundation right this is the building
[20:43] that's right
[20:47] they only want a perfect church for the
[20:49] Capstone to cap it off
[20:52] once it done again it's manifested to
[20:54] seven churches and seven Church
[20:57] Messengers started back here where was
[20:59] the church first founded
[21:01] Paul first aid Ephesians 8. second a
[21:05] Smyrna virtue irenius the great man who
[21:07] held the gospel call and he goes through
[21:09] all of them
[21:11] didn't come in brotherly kind and stood
[21:13] the layout of sin and we believe the
[21:15] great message of the second hearing of
[21:16] Elijah in the last day
[21:18] shall sweep the land
[21:20] all right now watch look right here
[21:25] that's a paradox
[21:28] because
[21:29] laodicea means people's rights
[21:32] layout of seal means totally opposite
[21:34] from anything brotherly kindness is
[21:37] Broly kindness is gone in this age
[21:39] people listen but but not for a group of
[21:42] people that's in this age that has the
[21:43] new birth that's trying to live the best
[21:46] they can and trying to live a Godly life
[21:49] it is probably kindness in the loudest
[21:52] CMH but
[21:54] but the rest of the world is mayonnaise
[21:57] no brother kind
[21:59] so what it does it enhances more if you
[22:01] have brotherly kindness it shows more
[22:04] got it everybody got it shows more
[22:07] you know if you were living in an age
[22:09] that everybody was sweet and loving you
[22:11] know you just lived you couldn't shine
[22:13] you couldn't overcome that's what I was
[22:15] thinking about something last night
[22:16] maybe coming home from
[22:19] um
[22:20] Bible study
[22:24] it's
[22:25] it's an awesome time to live
[22:28] yes it is it's an awesome time but it's
[22:30] but it's one of the worst it's the worst
[22:32] time to to try to be a Christian but
[22:35] remember
[22:37] he that overcometh
[22:43] overcome what
[22:46] but you got to overcome it doesn't
[22:48] matter you put whatever in it cause your
[22:49] battle ain't my battle and my battle
[22:51] ain't sure about a battle but it's like
[22:53] I was telling Jim when people start
[22:56] getting sick I'm honest I'm sorry when
[22:59] people start getting sick I let
[23:00] backslide what's the first thing you do
[23:03] what's the first thing you do you all
[23:06] y'all done you quit Church
[23:08] you quit coming
[23:11] that's totally opposite in what you
[23:13] should be doing right
[23:15] totally opposite
[23:17] but see the devil wants it to be that
[23:19] way
[23:20] now sometimes we're sick and we can't
[23:22] help but I know that but what about our
[23:25] spiritual life
[23:27] people disappear for a month or two
[23:30] why
[23:34] they backside
[23:38] when it should be
[23:40] see that's not overcoming unless they
[23:42] come back
[23:44] that's not overcoming that means they
[23:46] never had anything to start with
[23:48] right
[23:49] if they leave and don't come back they
[23:51] didn't have it that's right okay they
[23:54] didn't have what they thought they had
[23:55] okay
[23:58] but then in the Bible talks about he
[24:01] that overcometh
[24:03] to get here on time on Sunday is an
[24:07] overcoming
[24:09] staying at home just because you gotta
[24:12] you know your cat's got diarrhea
[24:19] where's the overcoming part
[24:22] now I can read in the scripture where it
[24:24] says he that overcometh it's like a
[24:25] situation happened just the other day
[24:27] and the Bible says that if you can't
[24:30] take correction you're a pastor child
[24:33] now he doesn't say
[24:35] if you take correction I mean if you
[24:38] don't take correction because you
[24:39] believe he was right then all these
[24:41] stipulations the Bible says
[24:43] you don't take correction you're a
[24:45] master job period and don't say well if
[24:47] you feel good that day or even as
[24:50] brother random I don't know if it's in
[24:51] here but I know he's got there's one
[24:53] quote where he says even if you're
[24:54] spoken ill toward
[24:58] but if it's for correction
[25:00] and you don't take it your master child
[25:02] what I mean there's no stipulation if
[25:03] you don't take correction you're not a
[25:05] child of God period right period there's
[25:09] no stipulation of well I felt good that
[25:12] day or or John was you know John was
[25:15] feeling good and not feeling bad and
[25:18] and he corrected me and I got mad and
[25:21] stayed away from church or stayed home
[25:23] or whatever you know put your situation
[25:25] in there but you got to overcome that
[25:27] the Overcomer is the one that's going to
[25:29] win because the Bible says the last
[25:34] overcoming there's remember the Bible
[25:37] says there's I mean you see preachers
[25:39] say the seven overcoming
[25:41] because there is seven churches they're
[25:43] heated overcoming but there's eight
[25:45] overcoming
[25:47] go to Revelations 21 or 22. it says he
[25:51] that overcometh shall receive all things
[25:56] you have to overcome there yeah this is
[25:58] coming these right here is like
[26:01] um
[26:02] Monique of them's dad said one time he
[26:04] said these are Trials of life
[26:08] that's what Trials of life is going to
[26:11] perfect this right here
[26:13] I mean how are you going to have a
[26:14] Temperance if nobody mad at you
[26:17] how you gonna have patience if
[26:19] everybody's on time and everybody no you
[26:21] got to have an overcoming there's an
[26:23] overcoming part to this that's true he's
[26:25] an overcomer it gets all these promises
[26:27] it doesn't say the one that that slacker
[26:30] Slackers don't get don't get overcoming
[26:33] okay what I was just saying
[26:37] when we get sticky and get offended
[26:40] instead to me it's when we haven't been
[26:43] praying and reading our Bible like you
[26:45] know when you do a lot of that you just
[26:47] things just roll off you it takes care a
[26:50] lot of them it sure does so whose fault
[26:52] is it it goes right back
[26:55] even though you spoke guilty
[26:58] how do you react back to that because if
[27:01] that person speaks ill to you he's going
[27:03] to have to give an account for speaking
[27:05] ill to you but he's like Daddy said
[27:06] though if the guy tells you the truth
[27:08] because people that you know that this
[27:09] is my whole point
[27:11] as long as as long as brother Dale's
[27:13] talking about everybody else's problem
[27:15] I'm fine
[27:17] but when he starts talking about my
[27:18] problems then he's the one that's got a
[27:20] bad attitude you know when he talks
[27:22] about y'all
[27:24] y'all say that's wonderful man preaching
[27:27] brother God bless your heart just preach
[27:28] it just just learn that thing out but
[27:30] when he starts talking about me I go
[27:32] live he that
[27:33] he's doing that in a bad attitude you
[27:36] know
[27:37] hello is anybody human in this room yeah
[27:49] I told sister Glenn we were talking
[27:50] about it today she said it's about being
[27:52] sweet I said I've never been sweet so
[27:54] I'm consistent
[27:55] consistent I'm just gonna stay this way
[27:57] I'm consistent I'd rather have somebody
[28:00] consistent than being up and down
[28:03] I think it's a Christian you you if
[28:06] you're an overcomer if somebody talks to
[28:09] you and in a bad tone
[28:12] and you know you take it as correction
[28:14] it doesn't really offend you your
[28:16] feelings could be hurt you realize why
[28:20] am I doing it right
[28:23] that's like brother Dale you know he he
[28:25] every sermon to me is a correction
[28:27] sermon because we're sheep we need to be
[28:30] correct here now it may not be so much
[28:33] as one person but
[28:36] we all need to be more diligent praying
[28:39] and reading our Bible Well if he says
[28:42] well if he says that then we shouldn't
[28:43] all get offended right we should say
[28:45] uh-huh that's right you know because you
[28:48] know that's what your problem is that's
[28:50] right like I said Freda said if you
[28:52] don't read your Bible and don't study
[28:53] and you know what has happened to me I
[28:55] know what's happened to you that's right
[28:56] you lapse in time and let something get
[28:58] in your way and you don't read or study
[29:00] for a week or two hello for a week or
[29:02] two we've all done it let every life get
[29:05] in the way all the time the attitude
[29:08] comes afterwards right bad ones mostly
[29:12] we get a bad attitude why because we
[29:14] haven't stayed inside that little
[29:18] uh we haven't said the right Comfort do
[29:21] I yeah the right dog that's correct amen
[29:24] bro that's right all right go ahead Amen
[29:26] brother okay so we'll stop right here
[29:29] we'll start here
[29:32] oh absolutely just see how you yeah how
[29:35] you react that's right so who's so who's
[29:39] the winner the one that reacts the right
[29:40] way yeah to see how you react
[29:44] now that's pretty something if God
[29:47] allows somebody to say something to you
[29:50] now whose Perfection is that for yours
[29:52] not the person that says it it's for
[29:55] your Perfection all right let's go
[30:00] we might get number 12
