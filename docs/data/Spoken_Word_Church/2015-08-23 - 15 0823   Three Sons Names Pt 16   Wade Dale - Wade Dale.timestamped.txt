[0:00] we got we got not starting down here oh
[0:04] I have kind of figured out a little bit
[0:07] now to deal with kind of work on this
[0:09] thing right there so let's see if we
[0:11] pull for close-up I'm going to read you
[0:13] some clothes the profit now I looked up
[0:17] the other day because I wanted I want to
[0:20] make sure you understand I'm not just
[0:22] saying that Jesus was the son of God to
[0:26] the church agent whether Brown said it
[0:27] several times so let's see I gotta
[0:30] figure out how to get back to this dumb
[0:38] here we go i've been i've been playing a
[0:42] little building community alright so
[0:45] this is 1965 large events made clear by
[0:47] prophecy now remember if i see that
[0:51] we're going to review a little bit but
[0:53] once it's remember he comes in three
[0:55] sons name he came first in the nameless
[0:57] on a man Jesus when he come on earth all
[0:59] right he never called himself to some
[1:01] God all right so Peter did not tell him
[1:05] who it was I who the son of man was he
[1:07] going to lose another god was he missed
[1:09] that revelation you know that see he
[1:12] came in the Son of Man profit jehovah
[1:14] himself to father called you're my soul
[1:16] man prophet of the son of man now he
[1:19] comes after the bed penticoff he came
[1:22] back in the form of the Holy Ghost
[1:24] supernatural now he's some guy Curtis
[1:29] right now he saw God he's not son of man
[1:32] I'm sure now he is now to us but through
[1:34] the church age he was what and for my
[1:37] holy go day of Pentecost that's when the
[1:39] turkey has begun right he come back in
[1:42] the form of the Holy Ghost supernatural
[1:43] spirit now he's son of god in the
[1:46] Millennium he'll be so David said on the
[1:48] throne of David art so you see where
[1:50] he's going to all right now let's go
[1:52] back read the next one
[1:59] proving his word the proper God said
[2:01] then he served his office & Son of Man
[2:04] service office son man then he served
[2:07] his office now I saw God God is the
[2:12] spirit and when now he served through
[2:14] the church ages as son of god so there's
[2:18] your son of God revelation on this rock
[2:21] Peter I'll build my church whatnot
[2:22] revelation so mad revelation the Sun God
[2:25] God in spirit form and the Holy Ghost
[2:28] coming back on the believer now in the
[2:32] Millennium he'll be son of David losing
[2:33] teeth Boeing Field he'll be the heir to
[2:35] the throne some of David's oh man some
[2:37] God something David and it's the same
[2:39] man all the time alright so it's not a
[2:42] different person but it's the same man
[2:44] all the time
[2:52] now let's go to proving his worth you
[2:59] just keep saying again that's the same
[3:01] thing he served his office now son of
[3:04] God God's the spirit and when now he
[3:06] served through the church ages as some
[3:09] guy nights least he's that he's and he's
[3:12] put a lot of the Son of God no one had
[3:15] to settle man revelation when Jesus
[3:17] Christ left this earth he took that
[3:19] revelation with them of the Sun lamp yet
[3:23] the seals he took that revelation
[3:27] winning he was the headstone the hex
[3:29] know what was rejected but when he was a
[3:31] projected at left all right because even
[3:34] Peter I mean even Paul writing in the
[3:38] old town New Testament he never
[3:40] mentioned much about the son of man all
[3:46] right let's read this if the church will
[3:48] come through justification do Luthor
[3:49] sanctification wesley driven baptism of
[3:53] the holy ghost and the Pentecostal then
[3:54] go right on into the perfection of the
[3:59] son of man all right so who was perfect
[4:03] Jesus Christ my brother Ron Spencer said
[4:06] the other night I really enjoyed that he
[4:07] said he said when he come before Pilate
[4:10] he said the devil was standing right
[4:13] there and he said when Pilate said I
[4:16] find no fault with you the devil if he
[4:20] would have anything against Jesus
[4:21] neither brought it up right there no
[4:23] earthly pilot he was focusing pilot and
[4:25] felt there was nothing all right so he's
[4:27] the perfect one all right but look
[4:30] through the profession into the
[4:32] profession of the Son of Man now it's
[4:35] not the son of man goes into profession
[4:37] right you and I go into perfection the
[4:40] Son of Man is perfected all right all
[4:43] right I'll and profane
[4:45] son of man took the body change the son
[4:47] of man is in the glorified condition
[4:48] he's the only man that was born of a
[4:50] woman okay who you talked to you can say
[4:55] any for whatever they don't Matt Barber
[4:57] one ever come to this earth live died
[5:01] rose and now he's worth my buddy right
[5:05] nobody nobody there's no one he didn't
[5:10] even do that Lodge didn't do that and
[5:12] then Jesus Christ Yolo was born a woman
[5:15] lived on earth is a man died hmm died
[5:19] rose up again now sure Hey look Lazarus
[5:23] born of a woman lived his life died rose
[5:26] again died got it all these people have
[5:31] been raised from the dead even the
[5:32] runarounds ministry I'm sure that wolf
[5:33] was think about the other than little
[5:34] boy in felon that was raised from the
[5:36] day absolutely America but you know what
[5:39] probably 70 years later he died and his
[5:42] body is still his body is still laying
[5:46] in the ground somewhere Jesus there's
[5:49] only one ft 10 what the Bible says only
[5:53] one empty tomb the only one that's reach
[5:55] a more immortality that means you were
[5:59] more one time and now you're in more see
[6:03] angels are just immoral they're not even
[6:05] really a more vigorous dieter could
[6:08] they're created creatures into eternity
[6:10] they never work more along they became
[6:12] in more they stay the same but there's
[6:14] only one that became what see we're
[6:16] mortal now we die like I said the other
[6:21] day we plant them in corruption raise
[6:23] them in incorruption all right Jesus
[6:26] died in corruption it was heading toward
[6:29] corruption right he wasn't corrupted but
[6:31] it was heading toward corruption it was
[6:33] beginning to break down but God raised
[6:36] him up because he did wouldn't suffer my
[6:38] Holy One to see corruption right when he
[6:41] raised him up glorified condition
[6:43] there's only one person in a glorified
[6:45] body right
[6:45] Jesus Christ no one else because he had
[6:50] to conquer that that's our scrap done
[6:53] that's right sí allí doing them they
[6:56] didn't conquer bad there and I really
[6:59] all right it's damned her brother Graham
[7:00] didn't understand much he just knows one
[7:02] thing for sure that that's why Elijah
[7:03] not too man Elijah but a lot just coming
[7:07] to the Jews listen the Jews no man
[7:15] brother Brown would have walked over
[7:16] there and showed them that side of them
[7:18] aside and knew they would have perceived
[7:21] that he was that Elijah the rapture
[7:23] would have took place and the Jews would
[7:25] have went home and I heard 44,000 we've
[7:27] been left all dead and all but that's
[7:28] not the way the Bible said that's why
[7:30] brother Graham couldn't go over that he
[7:32] can show that sound on sun because their
[7:34] eyes are still blinded my brother Dale
[7:36] we've been talking about but everybody
[7:38] understands so far some man some God so
[7:44] David just keep reading a few more
[7:46] because I want you to really should
[7:50] really see this
[8:04] I want to the unveiling of guard now
[8:06] read that the good one to read if you
[8:07] want to understand Oh throughout here
[8:13] very got 68 he can't pursue the Prophet
[8:16] know what he just explained what the
[8:18] Prophet was subtle man is the profit
[8:20] that's why I Ezekiel that's why I'm
[8:22] Jeremiah he say son of man problems not
[8:24] son of man props up son of man is a
[8:26] prophet all right now he came versus the
[8:30] Prophet they crucified his own crucified
[8:33] he came as the son of man then after the
[8:36] Holy Spirit came he was then the son of
[8:41] God God is a spirit he was the Holy
[8:43] Spirit some God he lived through the
[8:46] church ages a son of God alright but now
[8:51] remember what he keeps going went wrong
[8:54] he keeps going now in the Millennium
[8:57] he'll be so today they said on the small
[8:59] of his father David he's son David he
[9:01] says he's assigned David now not now
[9:03] that's when he was explaining when he
[9:05] was a son of David Wright and remember
[9:07] between the Son of God in the lab see
[9:09] interchange and put him out alright i'm
[9:13] standing at the door knock and they put
[9:15] him out they put him out and in Luke he
[9:18] said he would be revealed again and
[9:20] subtle and the Prophet fulfilling the
[9:21] rest of it that's why a lot of people
[9:23] call brother brown ones Deeks on a man
[9:25] because he was the problem he was the
[9:28] property that had signs of what so man
[9:30] hat but he wasn't these other men who
[9:32] was a son of men revealing the true
[9:34] prophet that was here the skechers type
[9:37] perfectly together shuttle and son of
[9:39] god son David what was it saying all the
[9:41] time just changes form in market he came
[9:45] a son a man the Prophet done exactly he
[9:47] was that woman and all her sin she
[9:49] recognized him he should we know the
[9:52] Messiah's coming when she called the
[9:53] Christ that's what he'll did you
[9:55] recognize okay okay then we got
[10:03] do I him for the Reformers they include
[10:07] the Wesleyan all down through them then
[10:09] we find out that they got it sold
[10:10] bundled up just like the Israelites did
[10:13] so when he does appear in the last days
[10:15] now he's don't like the first coming
[10:16] israel became so bundled up in their
[10:19] cribs and dogmas and ideas to Jesus they
[10:22] rejected but same thing that that's why
[10:26] brother around haggling diet this
[10:28] generation for the second crucifixion
[10:29] Jesus Christ they crucified not him they
[10:32] crucified the effects of the word all
[10:33] right till when he does appear in the
[10:36] last days in the Pentecost ways as the
[10:39] Holy Spirit they rejected it they did
[10:42] the same thing is we did and what does
[10:44] he do now return that son of man so in
[10:49] between writing between because brother
[10:53] God says three sons name course we know
[10:55] that he was son gone before everything
[10:57] started alright but he said son of man
[10:59] that's when Jesus come in for names came
[11:01] here son of man Sun God through the
[11:05] church agencytoday but brother branham
[11:08] is showing us now and later on in his
[11:10] ministry he understood what was going on
[11:12] and he put right in at the end time
[11:15] because that was his message right to
[11:20] restore all things that allowed you
[11:21] remember how to restore all things not
[11:24] just all things okay bring the head back
[11:29] that's what the Son of Man is doing now
[11:31] the Son of Man ministry is that ministry
[11:34] that no one understood Jesus for that
[11:37] three and a half years sure they got
[11:39] born again they got healing they got all
[11:41] the great things signs and wonders even
[11:45] the only of the word to a degree right
[11:48] Luther have a opening of the word for
[11:50] the great lastly had open the work to
[11:52] the Pentecostal time though they were
[11:54] degree but they were trying to tear him
[11:57] now now the headstones not print area
[12:04] hey stone not trapped Aaron the ex-cons
[12:06] not a false doctrine now you can have a
[12:10] little bit of false doctrine coming up
[12:11] here you sure you can that's wild at the
[12:16] head had to come that's why that
[12:19] everybody from here downs got to go by
[12:20] the grain because they can't get this
[12:22] thing out of the way they can't overcome
[12:26] this thing right here this is the
[12:28] problem Jesus overcame this thing right
[12:31] here son of man overcame because he was
[12:34] one he was God Almighty human flesh well
[12:37] what you and I got to realize that we
[12:39] are the same thing in portion as he was
[12:43] in the folder you know what's that we
[12:46] are in a portion we have to be the same
[12:49] spoon of ocean water chemicals what is
[12:54] that you say well you know you give us a
[12:56] little art and you put it under a
[12:57] microscope or you do kill him for work
[12:59] good you said have salt magnesium you
[13:02] said well this had to come from the
[13:03] ocean these are your chemicals these are
[13:09] your chemical Jesus had all these
[13:10] chemicals in its fullness he didn't have
[13:13] to battle over this heat he called you
[13:16] his friend and use done turn him in you
[13:18] know no malice no no no anger he's a
[13:22] lawyer no he wasn't angry he never lady
[13:24] he got mad at you down he never was
[13:26] angry right but he had the bonus of this
[13:30] this is our character we become up for a
[13:34] long time it is also our minimal this
[13:38] identifies where we come from
[13:43] your phone call you pour it in there you
[13:45] go that's got some fluid in it I didn't
[13:50] come from the ocean I come from the
[13:52] sewage pit all right but you put a
[13:57] little chlorine brother Browns the
[13:58] chlorine they glow chlorine and clean
[14:02] you up don't you put that red in that
[14:04] chlorine and it just does away with it
[14:06] same thing with our sins and the blood
[14:07] of Jesus Christ just doesn't alright so
[14:10] that's there's your chemical if you want
[14:12] to know what part if you want to know
[14:14] where you come from there's your genetic
[14:16] makeup right there same thing with a
[14:19] spoonful so we got to have these these
[14:21] have to be working in our life before
[14:23] that comes everybody goes well we
[14:25] understand the seals that we don't
[14:27] understand Daniel sending weeks and some
[14:29] of that end of the period or the
[14:33] teaching of the statute perfect plan
[14:35] well they got it reverse no they just
[14:37] think they know what they're coming all
[14:39] they're doing is quoting what's allowed
[14:40] see it right now true revelation but you
[14:44] got to start here and go up to there and
[14:46] you got to have the Holy Ghost ceiling
[14:48] you in then he brings you the word
[14:50] always bringing the word all up do hair
[14:52] they brought on the word i'll do seven
[14:55] church ages but right at the end time to
[14:57] forward that eli go back to Matthews
[15:00] everything daddy Lyons to come and
[15:02] restore hollow all things what back to
[15:05] that three and a half of your son of man
[15:07] ministry okay what
[15:16] I've been thinking about Peter exactly I
[15:20] wonder exactly working soon he thought
[15:22] Jesus was I mean when he said thou art
[15:26] the Christ the store thought that's what
[15:28] we didn't have the revelation of man
[15:36] well no one thing here to help holy
[15:39] ghost at that time that's why he said
[15:41] flesh and blood that reveal to you what
[15:43] is flesh and blood none of my
[15:46] inspiration blood he's a flesh-and-blood
[15:48] have revealed this to you but my father
[15:49] which is in heaven in other words in
[15:51] other words it was what was inside they
[15:54] can understand he was different they
[15:56] even called him the Creator they knew
[15:58] that creator lived in that lamb but they
[16:00] could not connect that that was the
[16:02] flesh of God I don't think they would
[16:05] have told him it said you're the flesh
[16:07] of God now let's see your son of God
[16:09] what would be another form coming down
[16:11] Peter Peter said let's make greet our
[16:15] apples look at the devil the devil is
[16:18] into everything he was on that mountain
[16:21] with him he said let's make a
[16:23] Trinitarian doctrine out of this program
[16:25] right here three Peter Jesus kept
[16:30] telling Peter get behind me Satan can
[16:32] you say was talking to Peter and give me
[16:33] one don't you think God knew exactly
[16:36] where the devil will happen the whole
[16:37] time computer said let's make three
[16:40] Tabernacles but brother let me tell you
[16:42] something when Jesus told Peter said
[16:44] after your converting strengthen the
[16:48] Brethren in other words after your
[16:49] converted you're gonna have a different
[16:50] doctrine then you got right now and now
[16:53] you can strengthen the brother I don't
[16:55] even want you to talk about nobody
[16:56] that's one so I
[16:56] hope those can't really help you know
[16:59] they talk about stuff they don't have if
[17:01] they don't have the life in size they
[17:03] can't give it to somebody else right the
[17:05] seal out has to come to the body and
[17:07] then that's why I believe we got a lot
[17:09] of preachers in this message and yes I'm
[17:11] don't say it on the internet we got a
[17:12] lot of preachers in this message it's
[17:13] not morning in it free to message me
[17:19] they you know they get a good outline
[17:21] and make a good speech but and if
[17:26] they're not born again absolutely their
[17:29] ship their followers are not going to be
[17:31] born yet don't remember you can't go any
[17:34] faster that's right that's why you get a
[17:37] lot of false doctrine also all right let
[17:40] me get one more
[17:45] there are people around
[17:52] did on the 1815 says the Lord your God
[17:55] to raise a prophet like it under me and
[17:57] so that scripture cannot be broken he
[17:59] had to come in son of man alright so
[18:01] that's the prophet now that was for his
[18:04] age when he was here on her not a man
[18:06] right then excuse me then when he died
[18:10] rose ascended and sitting back the holy
[18:13] spirit that was the Sun God God and they
[18:16] speared him through the church ages it's
[18:18] been good some God everybody got that
[18:21] same n ma'am so there he is he is he was
[18:25] the son of man on earth when he died he
[18:28] resurrected and came back on the day of
[18:30] Pentecost when Peter was filled with the
[18:32] Holy Ghost that was the son of God
[18:34] speaking I called the son of man in
[18:37] heaven what did what did Phillip say not
[18:45] a man standing on right hand of God what
[18:46] he see some jesus he saw a man is his
[18:50] spirit he saw the man all right the end
[18:54] of millennium it's not a David but
[18:57] that's what in the end time folks that's
[18:58] what that's what our I hold purpose we
[19:04] missed the whole purpose of being here
[19:08] the whole purpose of being here is to
[19:13] reveal some way
[19:24] well now this is the statue of a perfect
[19:26] man brother ground reads God having
[19:29] providing some everything for us Hebrews
[19:31] 11 40 that day without us shall not be
[19:34] made perfect you get it these people who
[19:38] died in here I believe he's showing
[19:41] right here are waiting on us so this
[19:45] church has got to come to perfection in
[19:48] order to bring the resurrection so who
[19:52] resurrected so I God don't need a
[19:58] resurrection all right so a man needs to
[20:01] be resurrected out of the grave the Son
[20:03] of God never died the son of man and I
[20:06] right son of God King died but the son
[20:11] of man in the form he was living in at
[20:13] the time he was flesh and that flesh
[20:17] died so that's why he died some man rode
[20:23] son of God coming back now run around in
[20:28] it he said well he he rose he was in
[20:30] flesh listen brother branham's putting
[20:32] all that together one he's not coming to
[20:34] 40 or 50 days and he just walked on the
[20:36] earth he stopped because remember that
[20:38] was really honestly nothing went on
[20:41] during that Jesus would have here come
[20:43] they go fishing they never really
[20:45] understood I mean they never close
[20:46] what's in them you know finally realized
[20:49] who he was after a little one but that
[20:51] 40 or 50 days they really nothing
[20:53] happened but right there at the end when
[20:55] he ascended he ascended for a purpose he
[20:59] ascended for a purpose to come back
[21:01] remember the Angels Daniels were
[21:04] standing this in this same Jesus
[21:06] samjeeza till you see go up in this
[21:09] cloud today is going to come right back
[21:11] down in the sand cloud that's the Sun
[21:14] man being risen again because remember
[21:16] I've always said when Brennan random and
[21:20] dining us us we were better than he had
[21:23] died of us
[21:24] hi babe right because we killed Jesus
[21:27] Christ now we killed youth across that
[21:28] putting my great so the son of man had
[21:31] to be risen again from the dead there's
[21:33] Matthew 17 made fulfill when he was
[21:37] risen again do what not a person a
[21:41] message it was a message not a person it
[21:45] was draw a person he had to come through
[21:47] a prophet khurana brother Graham says a
[21:49] son of man revealing this other man they
[21:51] said a man revealingly son man revealing
[21:54] what those seven seals are seven unknown
[21:57] Thunder that would what put the head and
[22:00] body together oh Jesus has had a body
[22:03] off through seven churches the body of
[22:05] Christ but remember they never had
[22:08] headship like we have this now they
[22:11] never understood headship you can't have
[22:12] on hex yet less you understand who he
[22:14] loves if Jesus was to ask me now who do
[22:20] you say that I the Son of Man I like
[22:22] that it I could I could in my own way
[22:26] you understand me I could at least make
[22:30] it a little excited you know I really
[22:33] hate I could because of the revelation
[22:34] that we've had open but now Luther if he
[22:37] asked Luke or the same thing as Peter he
[22:40] would tell the same thing Peter said now
[22:43] work the Christ you are Jesus Christ the
[22:46] Son of the Living God that's all the
[22:49] revelation beeping okay so
[22:54] you set your aperture Caroline when some
[22:55] people want to perfection through these
[22:58] were trees weekend when you do that up
[23:00] to a certain point because perfection
[23:02] still have to come to us thats related
[23:05] well you have to be ready ok you have to
[23:09] make the bride has made herself ready
[23:10] for the head in the body of your night
[23:13] now if you come to adoption the head and
[23:15] body is already you know brother Brad
[23:20] with the head and the body was already
[23:21] United when brother animals here this
[23:23] headstone came down that's what happened
[23:25] to that cloud out in Arizona that's why
[23:27] I believe happened this same Jesus who
[23:30] you saw go up in a cloud he's going to
[23:34] come back in a cloud now wait a minute
[23:36] the Bible says I am rob said that's not
[23:39] that clever because he's going to come
[23:41] back in a mystery right right the
[23:44] mystery of the seven seals the mystery
[23:46] of the Seven Thunder he's coming back in
[23:48] a mystery they going to miss that one
[23:50] well I had a guy tell me one time he
[23:53] said I can't wait to look Eastern's
[23:55] gospel you know the Bible says the sky
[23:56] lid opening that's why all the graves of
[23:59] turn with the headstone for DS you know
[24:02] that check every grades don't in the
[24:04] world that believe in Christianity the
[24:07] headstones turned four days because
[24:09] that's where he's supposed to come and
[24:11] the resurrection come come he don't come
[24:13] out the east eastern gates Jerusalem you
[24:17] look all these headstone no I him any
[24:19] grave you see there everyone turned
[24:21] unless it's just some awesome but
[24:23] they're all term for these so they
[24:25] believe that's what's going to help the
[24:26] rhetoric I guess I lost my call coco
[24:32] milk cloud a cloud so the clown had to
[24:36] come from the West but remember what did
[24:40] they tell him they didn't he didn't get
[24:44] the revelation out with they said go
[24:48] back east
[24:51] that's where the Sun rises in need he's
[24:54] basically I've had people tell me oh he
[24:57] got the revelation out there he said
[25:01] three or four times he said they didn't
[25:03] all they don't told me to go back these
[25:05] and it would be revealed to you and then
[25:07] even during the seals he said I was
[25:08] sitting in a room that mission woods and
[25:11] all them sitting in the neighbors steady
[25:13] and he came in giving the revelation of
[25:16] the sea I mean he kept telling me every
[25:17] day every day then they want to get you
[25:20] know there's a piece of something that
[25:21] they want to really got Arizona they
[25:23] want to give him his dinner something
[25:24] where they know the seven seals will
[25:27] reveal East yes as the type shown that
[25:32] he come he's resurrecting again brother
[25:35] branham went back out east dude you're
[25:37] gentle simbel to what to resurrect Jesus
[25:40] again and not informed I've been in
[25:43] Revelation he come back alleys gave us
[25:46] the revelation and guess what when Jesus
[25:50] raised nobody understood it right forty
[25:53] days Peter's going fishing they're going
[25:55] over here that I mean I like you I'm
[25:57] telling you if if Danny was to die and I
[26:01] see him preach his funeral they closed
[26:03] that casket they put him in the grave in
[26:05] three days later he comes up north
[26:07] tonight you will know fishing tomorrow
[26:10] now look I wouldn't say no but I think
[26:15] I'll go walmart
[26:20] I'd be breathing the same air he
[26:23] breathing I wouldn't because the
[26:26] revelation that I have now now they
[26:27] didn't have a revelation he appeared to
[26:30] him and they're like oh because I wake
[26:32] up I didn't go back work right yeah ways
[26:37] that 500 brethren stall him and only 120
[26:41] later in the upper room I will simone de
[26:43] libras in there didn't have to see him
[26:45] alive and it had seemed I haven't seen
[26:47] foot integrate right right him him come
[26:51] back in there as well whoa lookie
[26:53] program after the sealed open everybody
[26:57] rejected he preached the thousands
[27:01] before 63 he preached to 20 in a trailer
[27:05] I preached the rapture message in the
[27:06] trailer out Arizona for 25 or 30 people
[27:10] after he preached the resurrection the
[27:14] greatest message the seals the greats
[27:16] message they'll hit ever since Jesus
[27:17] Christ and people rejected worse than
[27:21] than than male and he said he said that
[27:23] I'll be rejected what what Jesus demand
[27:27] but listen it didn't stop what he died
[27:29] though the continuation of the
[27:32] revelation was actually for me and you
[27:34] today because if you're reading
[27:35] questions and answers he says going
[27:37] through you what stay in your revelation
[27:41] stay in your revelation you're under
[27:43] that old Pentecostal late you stay this
[27:45] is all you got to understand that's
[27:47] really what he was telling this is all
[27:49] you're going to understand and you're
[27:51] ending up lunch down a lot of it but
[27:54] you're born again ma would you like not
[27:57] but the ones are going to catch this
[28:00] that's not going to hold them anymore
[28:02] he's already died already raised raised
[28:03] already went to all that so what we're
[28:05] doing is we're walking right into the
[28:07] change so let's go we'll finish this
