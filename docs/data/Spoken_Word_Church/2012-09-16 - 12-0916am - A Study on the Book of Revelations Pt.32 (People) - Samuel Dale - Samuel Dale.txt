unto us thank you for the hour that we're living upon the earth and the time that we have to be able to Fellowship together one with another and just come and speak to our hearts this morning and

problems just let everything be okay we love you and we thank you Father have your way now as we read your word and you come and speak to us in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 now the Lord willing and said the Lord willing next Sunday we're going to be we're going to take the uh way that kind of like we've done the Daniel 70 weeks uh up at the uh ministers meeting and it is on the internet if you want to download it you can see the the presentation that we made there and has been requested we do it here so we're going to try to to do that so the Lord willing next Sunday uh I'll take the morning service and kind of present the part and then Wade can take the evening service to to be able to present his part that way we can approach it a little different by having a different amount of time we were kind of limited there but it worked out real good I thought and so just remember that amen Revelations 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he said and signified it by his Angel and to his servant John who by a record of the word of God and the testim of the testimony of Jesus Christ Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein amen for the time is at hand what is it time to understand is at hand let's go over to chapter 6 all right we read 1 through one and two from the last Parts we've been on and now let's go to verse three and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see and there went out another power that was red and power went out another horse that was red and power was given unto him that set there on to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been doing this in the series and we came up through uh chapter 5 and saw that it was actually the opening of the seals and things but that is to showing that what would go to Israel because we believe that you know the seals is to Israel amen the Revelation is to the bride right you say yeah but brother Dale we we get the seals well you better be careful talking about getting the seals because the first seal is the man of sin sitting in the temple of God showing himself to be as God right so I wouldn't want to be there when it happens because that's when he's incarnate will get back in the minute in the form of the Beast amen well see then that would put you in bad shape right I certainly wouldn't want to be there with the uh killings of Armageddon the different things and I certainly wouldn't want to be there on the six seal and then we totally be left out in the fifth that that be in the souls Under The Altar and I certainly don't want to be uh left out of this do you amen so then I know that's a a way of people thinking because it's always just been that way uh that people just say uh the seals we understand the seals uh that's the white horse rider well now uh that would be revealing Satan yeah and the Bible is not revealing Satan it is revealing Jesus Christ we just read here in Genesis I mean in Revelations one one it's the revelation of Jesus Christ right we've been over this over this and over with it for you for 40 years trying to get you to understand because see there's no such thing as a revelation of the devil that's right there's a revelation of Jesus Christ he would have to be something to be revealed right right right and he's not anything he he's a demon power he's a he's a Spirit he's all the things but see the Bible is revealing Jesus Christ and I know people will get that and they say boy you really are messed up because we see that's what it we believe we who what gives you any right to believe anything other than what God says that's right you say well who gives you the right I don't have none I just forfeited mine and have tried my best to be able to yield to him to make him speak through me through all of these years and I haven't changed in 40 years so I don't think you'll need to worry about changing anymore you know we just forget it done too old to change you know I'm not trying to run for president so I don't have to worry about a change that's what got him in our lifesty I don't know what's going to get who in this time but we ain't worried about it because it's like I told him one time in fellowship meeting I said you want me to tell you who's going to be president and they said they were just looking you know I said we you want me to even give you thus sayith the Lord everybody just drawing back I said the Bible said I take out Kings and not put in Kings the one that we need in the White House is going to get in the white house that's right they ain't worried about it and if I knew who was the one would be able to take us down to bring a bride to a point to where that she would be concerned and I was a casting vote of the finality I'd go cast it in a hurry you know to to get this thing underway amen because you know we we co along here long enough we fought it around horb and all this you know 40 years they did and just kept going around and around finally one day they said let's go across we need to get out of here all right but see it's not the revealing of the Antichrist right it's the revealing of Jesus Christ Through the Bible and then that will make known who the Antichrist who the the devil is that's right oh we know who the devil is he's the god with the horns that's pretty good no yeah he's the guy that used to sit in all of our souls and if you're not born again today he's still sitting there that's right and even after the Born Again experience he's the guy that can still work on the body and spirit that's right I've never seen the devil look in the mirror in the morning that's right and say good morning devil oh no I'm a Christian that's right that's where the deceiving part is at of what he has done and how he's been able to do it right until we get to the point that you know that we we look at him as like something the Bible says he's like a man laying in a ditch right what are you going to do with a drunk laying in the ditch you afraid of him who the devil you have to be careful you know he's powerful he can only do what God lets him do right so then I'm not afraid of him like what brother Al he's not here when he said the other day he said he in there doing something praying or something said the devil C he said Bo devil said sister an's in the other room what loud enough she heard him then boo devil well that's what we ought to do keeping and drive him off right and all you got to do is Boo devil well the best way to boo devil is not to say boo but say Jesus Jesus Jesus that's the boo that I use I don't go around Boo and holler at I just say Jesus take care of this thing Lord come on the scene and take care of everything cuz I can't do it all right let's get down into what we're talking about now see then we saw from the messages we preached on the first SE the first part of there the white horse rider that we saw that that was the Antichrist right and we saw that John talked about in his little John's when after he come back from P patas you know that he talked about an antichrist but see Paul and them they they never said the word Antichrist Paul called it Grievous wolves stuff like that you know all right he would call it many different things and even look forward to seeing the point that when it would come to that there'd be a man of sin to sit in the temple of God shown himself to be as God am sure but yet he still didn't see what John saw right amen because even John was not able to express that when he came back from patmas himself because when the seals were broke they were broken under John and he saw a white horse and a rider their own and he saw that he had a bow and no arrows and and he saw that a crown was given unto him all right now then he goes on to the next that we just read and he saw a red horse and he saw one that begin to kill and do different things and take peace from the earth well John in still now I quoted these over and over to you so I thought well I better get them and read them cuz somebody out there may you may you believe it maybe but somebody else may not well I don't really know brother around the city so I pulled up a couple of things about John admiring this so go ahead brother Anderson and and pull it up and let's read it and look what your Prophet had to say about it see we think that the devil is so thing and like I said some great big monster walking across the Earth like a king kong you know my D know he's going to bow down to me no no it's got to be a religious Society Amen to get you to bow down even uh Hitler was not trying to get him to bow down and and make him God he was just wanting to Ru rule everybody he wouldn't saying you got to bow down and kiss my toe and you got to do this or whatever no he wasn't a religious he was political and he was governmental but not religious right now if you don't get nothing out of the message today get one thing how easily it is to be deceived amen that's right yes sir mhm how easy it is to be deceived we've been told all of our life but this is your right hand well by whose standards a horse is measured not by inches or feet a horse is measured by hands right well some of you have very small hands and you measure a horse by that and then you compare it to brother Arline they used to have them some finger so long until you know i' hated for him to slap me on the face because they would come all the way around the back of my head and hit the other side well now whose hands according to brother Arline then you measure the horse it just be a Shipman Pony but according to some of our hands it might be a great big old tall horse you said well that's no just getting the point of the cross how easily it is to be deceived right that's right and think we're right now we are not against any church of any form right now Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostals Catholics or anything we're not against that we're against the system that caused that to come into being that's right to where churches separate from one another because of doctrines but not because it we're against the people see we we came from there all right and and you know me I don't preach out dire right I preach the deception is in here right where you and I are at cuz what's out there is no concern right see we have wonderful friends and people that are you know out there yeah like I told you the boy called me the other day and left a message and I used to I worked with him for many many years at dville and he said he was going to be baptized and wanted me to come and he then he called me back and told me he left the message we're still talking on the answer machine but anyhow he said he couldn't get it done there was something came up a death in the church but he wanted me to know that he was going to get baptized he also said he was sorry about the way he had talked about me and things as we work together at G Motors I thought that's a great thing am this world is full of good people but when you're deceived you're deceived now that's the Simplicity that I'm trying to get it to each and every one of us we studied the Bible for many years didn't we before we heard of this message yes and we're deceived by understanding or thinking that the Bible was teaching that there was three gods or God in three persons Blessed Trinity and wish wor by those things as being what the Bible had to say right but then we found out that wasn't what it was saying that's right see you know what we were we were deceived Now Eve in the garden in the Garden of Eden Eve was deceived the Bible say right amen she thought she was right right definitely Adam was not deceived the Bible said he he knew what was going on right amen but she was deceived by Satan through the Beast to talk to her right and things and it got into her mentality and it deceived her I've always told you what I believe about that I believe that she actually was thinking that she was bringing forth the promise of God cuz later she said I've gotten a man from the Lord but how deceiving can you be Amen to cause a whole world to come into a chaos what you believe right amen my brother bless God Brother D I'm not deceived well it's kind of like what they say and it's not a joke but they say if you go down to an insane in institution and they'll ask you some questions and they say are you crazy and you say no they said put him over here in s we'll talk to him later if he say well you crazy and they said we are I probably am a little bit they said well put them over there we can help that person go I mean you know we ought to realize that we've all been deceived all right now then you come into this message and look at the doctrines that are flinging oh Lord that's right and did some of you believe those doctrines and where you came from and the things you were in right so what about it how easy it is to be deceived now John sees this situation on patmas he sees a church system so go ahead brother and pull it back up I get to read on it but look what he sees this taken spoken words original SE paragraph 20 The Prostitute of Revelation 17 was a church yep and you know that the Catholic Church admits these things are their Church the mystery the the the the the Babylon coming over and the the things and they admit it you see we Protestants oh no I can't be deceived no we already are right but look what he says the prostitute of Revelation 17 was a church John had ad ired her because of her of her beauty what she was she was a beautiful thing but yet in her was found the blood of every sa of Jesus Christ had been murdered in her yeah what about a deception amen what about a deception that you could think he was right and you kill people y you know you know know that scripture it's scriptural amen let's read it M 21 now now didn't Jesus say there come a time they would kill you thinking they were doing God a service that's right that it's Bible do you need it it's in the scripture it's in the gospels right that Jesus said they'll kill you thinking they're doing God a service right mhm now how far could you be mentality in your mind right so low that you could kill somebody Y and say well I was doing it for your benefit come on Church yep but yet congregation says amen amen maybe a lot of you didn't they did right and they're sincere about that they're not Hypocrites that's right I they believe that right they're taught that m i mean Jesus said they'll kill you and we'll read it in a minute where the Catholic Church under St hippo I believe was his name started to killing and killed 68 million Protestants right you know what they was using the scripture do it say it's better to make people serve God by force than not than to not serve him at all that was what they used right and they backed it up with scriptures of course they were Twisted right but what do we think I don't think there's anybody in the world wants to kill me but there's probably a lot of people that say well you know he is messed up a lot of things so we're better off without him you know yeah but that's all right but look at the prophet he said and their sin he about it amen he said they're not Hypocrites a hypocrite is somebody's not sincere right no Hypocrites what does is what well that's what's you're saying come on what about killing people believing we're right right MH yep wasn't it the Methodist that put John Smith or who who was him back there they put a man to death it was it Luther one of them put in death because of believe in the word no now those are good people I just explained that that's right amen it's bad to say but you know hell is going to be full of good people amen how would you do if you were back in the Dark Ages they would take a cross and then tie you to a you know a cross and or whatever pile sticks around you and get ready to burn you and hold a cross up in front of you you realize a situation I'm talking about yes that here's the group of people that's putting these people to death that they're over here praying let's all pray that this man will get converted before we burn him yeah yeah come on you're talking about religious people right right amen and they're praying that's right not Hypocrites they're praying and they're thinking if we can get that man converted from believing yeah in what what was the argument what was the things back there you don't ever think about it get Fox's book of Martyrs and read it that's right and here's a priest standing with a cross and you're tied to a tree and if it's to burn it deny that God you believe in you look back up and say what do you mean so sir would you explain to me what you mean you deny that God you believe in and you say well don't you believe Jesus Christ died for our sins MH yes I believe it I believe he died for our sins what are you killing me for because you don't believe the Virgin Mary died for your sins yeah amen right come on but get the picture draw it out in your mind y That's right two people looking at each other and both of them claiming to be Christians right right and one of them would be like polycarp it was told to him that when they come to kill him he requested time cooked them a meal let him sit down and eat and pray for 2 hours right for the people that had come to take him in well you know what when they sit down to eat he give them a meal right well can't you just see the old priest that walks in or whatever he is Will okay we'll eat you meal PRI says hold a minute God sa a blessing and he prays over the food and sanctifies it in the name of Jesus Christ like come on Church wasn't that what happened yes but see they had come up with the idea that it was better to make you serve God yes and to kill you if you wouldn't do it and even using the scriptures right to back up what they were doing look at the next reing the first seal paragra 328 but now he said he wanted it see they wanted it listen so it give them a strong delusion is that the Bible he knew they wanted it and Paul said they would give him a strong delusion God would to believe a lie and be damned by the lie that you believe righten cuz he knew they wanted it that's right remember the prostitute of Revelation 17 she is a mystery yep a mystery is something that you do not understand you understand it's no longer mystery is that sensible right something you don't understand is a mystery yes right so now Revelation 17 is a mystery right it's even call M babblin in your Bible mother of harlots y see then when you look at it you can't see what it is if you do it's not a mystery right right right come on and John admired her just like this man look to wait till we get here and watch him watching this White Horse but you notice he was what happened was this that he admired her with her great admiration married her with great Mar admired her with great admiration but the mystery was that she drank the blood of the martyrs that's right a beautiful church that there decked in purple and gold and she had a cup in her hand all the filter this of her fornication now John admired this you know the thing that I'm talking about is so much a mystery until everybody in the world yep come on but the Lord Jesus Christ was deceived by that mystery amen even the one you claim to be your Prophet amen we'll read it in a minute what did he say he said I'd have made a horrible mistake if the Holy Spirit hadn't corrected me see he used to teach that the white horse rider was the Holy Ghost what he found out it was the Antichrist amen he said later said I've been around this all the time and didn't know exactly what it was I know people out there you ain't going to like that that's all right you you deal with studying the prophet's message what about the greatest Prophet that has ever been on the earth outside the Lord Jesus Christ was deceived by the church system now come on folks let be sensible right he knew they was wrong in this and wrong in that and wrong in this one and wrong in that one right don't be foolish in you're thinking he knew that the Baptist had wrong the Methodist had wrong they they taught a trinity they they baptized father son Holy Ghost right right they believe hell was eternal and the serpent seed was eaten apple he knew all that was wrong right but yet that Antichrist was so close to Jesus Christ yep until the world was deceived amen and so was a prophet until 1963 when that first seal broke to him and you and I are still deceived by it I don't care how much you can quote amen until that seal is revealed to you and I amen that's why I drive it so hard to say we get the revelation of the seal that's right we don't get the literal happening under those things that's right amen we look back and see that that I doing the other day going all the way back to Genesis right amen going back to the garden and Eve being deceived who was doing that Satan amen you agree sir watch when he getting down in a little bit he instilled into a man named Cain he got eased mind and took her into adultery right he got into a man named Cain and don't you think they talked about what they were doing sure and G probably ridiculed AEL y able was just laying where taking care of the Sheep was out there working like crazy any of you ever put out a garden that's what he was doing he was digging out all of the rock getting out everything right and making a beautiful place for a garden and raising those things that he brought for his own offering and he was making fun of Abel and he said AB what you going to do tomorrow we got to give a sacrifice you know and said I'll have mine Cain worked yourself to death sweated like everything they come a day for the sacrifice Cain laid all of his out able went over in the flock and got a lamb come back might not at that time had a knife know that was probably later on when the steel to be able to be molded and made into metal he took a rock the prophet said and cut that animal stro can't you just see came why you murderer what do you mean you're in trouble with God cuz you killed an animal an innocent one look what I've got laying out God comes down and accepts Abel's offering Y and rejects Cain Cain had already got it from a deed to a Doctrine to a rule of life he turned around and killed a y yes and when we get over in the second seal you'll see then the killing started back there right The Killing didn't start at not see right amen that's right that's what I'm trying to tie together for you to get you to see it those seals go all the way back to Genesis and comes down through and we see it by Revelation and then when it goes to Israel the man of sin was in the temple of God showing himself to be as God Satan incarnate again is the Beast amen started with the beast in the garden and wind up with a beast in Revelation that's right yes sir well we better not be here when that happens amen amen the prophet said when that Antichrist started riding he said he rode down through and said he got off the White Horse he got on the red horse he rode the red horse a while he got off the red horse and got on to the Black Horse he got off the Black Horse and got on to the hail horse he said he rode that horse into eternity now I give you the direct quote I got it in the notes here now not meaning that the devil's going to ride into eternity that's right you know better than that yeah right that's right that's right amen it just means it's going right up to where eternity start right right you can't ride that Antichrist into eternity you'd have to give him eternal life right that's what we don't look at see that white horse is still riding y right amen that white horse didn't stop back there and the red one start the White Horse just keeps going the red ones R White it just keeps going the black one has gone and if and it just keeps going right the pale one finishes up y right you can't ride him into eternity he must be saying unto eternity right that white horse don't stop folks right that white horse is that Antichrist teaching that's in these people of the the message yeah amen and I don't mind admitting in you and I that's right let's get rid of brother that's what I'm trying to do amen right mhm that's what I'm spending my whole life trying to get it out of you and me you and me right only the reveal word amen can destroy the effects of Satan upon you am he's still right amen you still think you're right MH Eve thought she was right she never show me any word she ever repented come on I don't care what you think she done in the garden if it was eating an apple or a p a pomegranate or BL old nose she ain't never repented of it the Catholic Church killed 68 Million by their own record oh yes we I guess we might have messed up why didn't they dig up the bones of those priests and throw them in the river to show a repentance cuz they did do that at certain times Jonah arc when they finally found out she was a Christian right they dug up the bones and which meant symbolically that those people were lost right right well who's the six who's the people that killed the 68 million right why don't they admit all them laws no they're not going to do it right I I guess we was wrong and we we we apologize yeah well waiting a chance to start killing again right brother amen you know that they got to the place that they could go in and pay before they sinned right what was his name something called her the hun I believe it's his name was hun but he killed over a th000 people in one night well see he's okay cuz he do got forgiven yeah well that's deception ain't it well come on have you been to a funeral lately everybody's going to heaven like brother Steven Wilson says they going to do away with hell cuz ain't nobody going there I'm not against that I'm not saying it wrong I'm just saying it right if that person is born again they're going to heaven if they're not I don't care what good works how many times you paid the parking lot or painted the church right or how much money you put in the offering plate that's I heard one time about years ago and the said man that got pretty bad I saw him put $2 an offering plate one time more that put him in heaven what's the difference in that in paying the Purgatory come on you know it's right to pay them out of purgatory right this L Pope was so good he made a Whistle Stop L Pope was so great a guy he made a whistle sto in hell yeah go they believe everybody going to hell Purgatory what you want to call D made a Whistle Stop he just slowed down and rode through and they done prayed him out out yeah I kind of like what the person said one time and it's giv money to pay them to the priest to pay them pray them out of hell you know Purgatory they said we got him all out but one foot people tell F said he was a pretty good athlete he can walk without it leave his foot we done pay all we pay you say those things are silly believe right we say that's silly but what little concept do you have that's right Amen Brother D I believe brother R was a prophet that gives you PL excuse me that gives you front row in hell right you don't like that or know right that reserves your front row seat called first El Li Li first so you get a front row seat in hell for believ in the prophet Welly there's a lot of Internet went out that that's all right I didn't ask you to listen I'm just trying to preach the truth but you see if you're born again that's it that took me out of hell and give me a front row seat in heaven right amen if you're born again that way then I can believe a prophet cuz my Bible says no man can call Jesus the Christ right other than by the holy ghost that was in him not because he believed a prophet that's right right if you got the Holy Ghost you will believe the prophet there's no problems with it if we don't then we'll argue over ideas and thoughts amen okay doing pretty good now let's just make sure that we understand something follow a little point but I know this is reviewing but you know sometimes reviewing helps sir some of these quotes we've already given but sometimes it's good to give them amen that's good and to just see what the real truth of it is that's right to find that where or not whether or not we are received amen this is like I've tried to explain to you people say well understand one God water baptism no eternal hell serpent seeds seals Thunders plags this I don't understand Daniel 7 weeks that's right well now I've always made it plain to you mhm I believe one God has got to be revealed to you just exactly like Daniel said weeks has to be revealed that's right that's right serpent seed has to be revealed to you just exactly like one God has to be revealed how many of you remember when you first started reading even the prophet's message about one God and that Old Devil says Welly he believes in God in three person listen at it he said let's stand address the third person of the trinity well he BL a three God seei how many of you argued about the revelation of one God when you first heard it right come on let's go a little deeper how many of you went to the water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ when you first heard about the one God see that's where people don't like me you don't like me cuz I've heard people right here say boy when I first seen it I've done it and I remember it took me about 6 months to get you baptized and it certainly wasn't dry weather no Creek to baptize in right is because you didn't want it done because you didn't believe it when I first seen it man when I first seen I done it 5 years or something I got an office come sit down in it and I'll explain all them messages I preached and you frowned and Grom and went all and told everybody else how wrong I was Brother D missed it right here see I'm just honest I saw the one God because that's a bad this Doctrine brother Mo blowed me away on that one where he said it's a person it's a personality personality is an individual individ person your Trinity like anybody else I said don't believe that no more that didn't mean I understood everything I just knew that the man had took the scriptures and demoted me totally out of the way but it took me about 6 months to get baptized Oh you mean you're honest enough to admit it yeah sure it is how long it take you you know that I had to preach a good bit here one time on one little fact that a lot of people in this church would baptize in the name of Jesus Christ but it was baptized under regeneration that's under a denominational Doctrine and then some finally come and said I believe I need to get baptized again I said thank you toall because if you were baptized believing it was under regeneration right how deceiving are you that's right I'm not carnal I'm not funny but if all it takes is for you to baptize anybody I'll meet you on Lake laner this afternoon we won't have an evening service but everybody that come by that Lake will go in that water one way or the other you know that ain't going to save them no that's right if that's all it takes right see church trying to get us to see how easy it is to be deceived amen mama told me this mama told me this well Glory but was mama right right see we're in the with a computer now you can't argue mama said it right right you just run it in the computer and you can find out if mama said it or if it was Mama's idea about what brother R said right right you see how easy it is to be deceived right amen yes that's right you believe a lie the Bible says and be down by it in vain the scripture says you worship me teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men right you remember the story that brother Brandon was telling about the Jew that he was talking to and the old Jew couldn't get nothing over on brother brand because he trapped him with the scripture showing and asking him the question of who do you believe the Messiah will be and he said it' be God mhm so the man finally went up said that man Jesus said he was a thief but see what would most of us have ever come up with somebody told you Jesus was a thief what would you say well where was he a Fai no preach said he went through the corn field yeah and took corn little around said hold it sir you're own scripture says that it's lawful for you to go through a man's corn field and eat your field it said you can't put none in the stack and take it with you that's Bible that's how the poor folks was taken care of back then right you know right but how easy it is to be deceived what do we think about it pull up number one brother let's get started on we'll go a little while anyway taking for the first seal paragraph 266 you've heard this one before but that's what mankind thought but around thought it he thought that the white horse rider was the Holy Spirit that went forth in the early ages with his little arrow you know little bow and a little arrow shooting like cupid remember had a bow in his hand which meant like cupid he shot the arrows of love into the hearts of the people the love of God and he conquered that's what mankind used to believe that's what he believed the one horse rider was cuz he had a bow now that sounds very good you know why cuz that's the way he used to believe a little different form Maybe mhm right yep come on no sir that it wasn't what does mean righteous we realize that that b means righteous the teachers taught it what they teach that it was the Holy Spirit conquering in the first age but my revelation of it by the holy spirit is not that way now a revelation is going to straighten out a false Doctrine yes right that's the only way of false Doctrine can be straightened out yes is by Revelation right that's right now he's talking about the world religious system well trained people this church that John admired and little old Prophet with a seventh grade education and my Revelation not right there other words God has revealed something to me I'm going to tell you what he's revealed to me but my revelation of it is by the holy spirit is not that way my Revelation by the holy spirit is Christ and the Holy Spirit is the selfs same person see only in a different form so here stands Christ the lamb we know and he was the lamb we know he was the lamb he's standing here with the books in his hand and there goes the white horse rider see so it wasn't the Holy Spirit right amen now to a trinitarian what does it matter how many persons or personalities have you got y right they have riding all over the place FL don't matter to them but Dar stands a prophet with a revelation that the Holy Ghost In Christ is the selfs same person and out goes a white horse rider and I ask you to read the seal book there the first seal and see how many times he called him a he or a him or a guy or a person riding off y I ain't asking for no raise of hands for how many ready CU there probably be very few but you know all about it yes I know I'm hateful right if we was in school and I gave you that to read and you didn't read it you got a goose EG that's right that's right all right that's that's what I told you about then when we was going to that ministers meeting I said there'll probably be 30 people there and at least 10 out of them has never even read a book and you know that some of them admitted they had never seen a drawing that brother Brandon made on the 70 weeks never seen one yet waai now was wrong yeah we wrong because it's what I believe well you remember what happened in the garden you remember the prophet making a statement one day that Cain said to God y That's not in the Bible but this is the prophet translating what was happening Cain said to God he said I've done all I'm going to do take it or leave it he said and God left it right how horrible could a person be right to tell God that had told you what to do they said if you'll do like your brother you'll be accepted yep right that have not seen life at the door he had an opportunity right there amen amen amen but instead he said God you take it or leave it I'm not doing anything else now how many of you have said or heard people say the Baptist is good enough for Mama or Daddy it's good enough for me y That's My Mama died a Baptist I'm going to be a Baptist you ever heard that sure come on what's the difference right in the deception amen but listen church I know when I preach the way I preach it and I want you to listen but why can't you thank God for what he's reveal to you right for one time just sit down and think God look what you've done for me do that for somebody else instead of thinking brother Dale is such a hateful person to preach against churches and people don't you love him for what he showed you that's right I didn't choose this I didn't choose to be what I am I don't like to be hard and preach I love people I want to help them but I can't help what he reveals to me that's right am I to apologize for what God reveals no sir see because you don't hear me say things like other people say and I'm not against it that's between that person and God if my mother and my daddy was a born again Christian for the time they live they'll be there in the bride amen but if they wasn't they won't be there that's right I've always been honest with you if they weren't born again they won't be there maybe God will give him eternal life for bringing me that's just a great thing to be the bride of Christ amen amen sure in my heart I hurt to try to help people and talk to them and see them just turn it down you know that's right I want to see people believe in it amen that's right look what the next one look what he says on the next one paragraph 190 the second seal now first he become an antichrist now he couldn't be Antichrist only in spirit that's where F started out remember the other day we're talking when he first started out it was just a spirit didn't he become an antichrist look and that Spirit took a man that taught the same things that that Antichrist Spirit was was doing listen then he became a false prophet to the Antichrist Spirit now look at the next one I didn't say it what about a man in an organization shot yourself he said I don't know what you think about it but all right see what's he saying an antichrist Spirit working upon you right but if you become one with that Spirit you'll stay in an organized religion amen that's right or you'll come in this message and cause Havoc or how however you say it chaos to teach your Doctrine yep right right see an antichrist Spirit you can't Crown a spirit right right it's just the spirit it was first the spirit to came but then it become a Doctrine right a prophet to a system came become a prophet to his false Doctrine sure then Cain become incarnate with it Y and says take it or leave it I'm a pope you remember how we brought that out but you know what he became he became a beast yep and Rose up and killed his own blood brother yep and then when God come checking on Abel he said am I My Brother's Keeper mhm God turns to send him out of the land Y and look how hateful arrogant a man is he said God you can't send me out there he wasn't crying down on his knees and everything he said you can't send me out there they'll kill me remember the Bible y but the Bible said God put a mark on Cain what they wouldn't kill him that's right now did he stamping no he didn't make him black that ain't is yeah that's right blue or green what was the mark he put on it he told Adam and Eve and all the descendants to leave came alone because if not why didn't Adam ring the old boy's neck that's right right he killed his own his son why didn't he kill him y God told Adam to leave him alone that was the mark not a mark That's Blackness or cuz it is look at around in here if it's Darkness I ain't going out in the sun no more but every time I get out the sun I get turning dark lby Grace she look at me sometimes look at my arm put her arm up there see how de seeing right see first he was Antichrist y then he took a man now if he didn't first become incarnate with himself no he took a man the man be to be a prophet sure teaching a false Doctrine yep follow that all the way through the Bible amen right follow that up until get over there with Moses sometimes and there stood Moses telling them people what to do was it Dayan and coral you take too much upon yourself we're spiritual just like you we've heard from God we've seen Visions we've had all the things you've had and we're spiritual Moses said let's see yeah I want on God side just come over here yep 250 preachers with censors in their hand C off the altar golden bowet had it in Earth swalled him up the next day read your Bible the next day the people came to Moses and said you kill the people of God he would have turned around and said open that Earth up and swallow the rest of them right but no he would have done that had it not been for what Christ and Moses that's right that's correct oh you're goody goody I'm not too goody goody I would have been ready to kill the rest of the rasal you say Oh no you're supposed to be born again no I'm human too maybe I need a lot more Christ Moses God wouldn't come over him either right right you see where all of that's coming down to there yes what we what we see is the Finish y that's the message if I get thatone I'll finish it Wednesday when we're over here looking at the finish of anytime right right the remembrance got to have a beginning Amen brother said them seals begin in Genesis he said every doctor every been begun in Genesis that's right yes and worked its way down through that's right wa we get over to the killing and then you can follow it real good right Cain killed Abel then they started killing each other right over religious matters every war war that we've ever had was over religious matters may have been called governmental and all like that politics but had religion behind it what is it today islamics and what they're religious right they're serving the a of God Y and they're dying in a holy war that guarantees them a trip to Heaven sound pretty religious don't it yeah we don't do that I hope we don't I hope you don't say this cuz you believe it's messing you get a free trip to have yeah come on my kids ain't never been Dred out neither's the church been Dred out so not by me all right let's get this last little part cuz this is what we were on the other day read this last one paragraph 160 Maybe the next two where we get all of the wording together all and I want you to notice the four of them notice the off Mark of the four of the spiritual mathematics God is St see father son Holy Ghost this is forward now Satan comes in four so God has to counteract him and they for combat Beast right because they four beast of the Antichrist the White Horse the red horse the black horse The Pale Horse so God has to counteract that right it was four stages of your bug the canor pal worm Locust and caterpillar the Jo spoke of that ate it down so then God has to come back with justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost Incarnate Word amen right but see it's correct way of doing things is father son holy cost amen right God is fre this is four about the Antichrist he's in four here first Antichrist why that's the first SE second false prophet red third VI of heavens and earth and Purgatory black fourth the Beast Pale Horse Satan being kicked out of heaven you got to be kicked out of heaven before he can become the Beast amen right I love that yep he's up right right now the Bible says accusing the brethren but he's going to be kicked out see we're going to have a spiritual Army again amen not a physical arm again we're going to have a spiritual one in our lives and we're not getting out of here these seals didn't apply to us in every form but they don't they've done been open for us right Jesus preached six seals in Matthew 24 that's right amen and was the saath himself amen MH so then what is it the four stages what Antichrist false prophet vior of Heaven and Earth which makes him what a pope right a pope see the Antichrist didn't kill nobody Spirits don't kill people right false prophet that moved on the scene with it number two he just started that Doctrine first I seeing counil was not over one God or three it was over whether Jesus was God or a light substance and reenan Creed that come from it that stat said in her own Creed Jesus is the substance of God but the idea of the doctrine had done been planted into the man people's mind and brother said to bride or not have went to n right you can say well they left out Bo they didn't get to see yes they brought brother said they brought back with them you don't read enough to read them things bless God I believe it I believe the true bride couldn't go to nille then you're making your prophet lie cuz he said they did go on forget it you believe the doctrine y you go where the doctrine come from yep because the first was an antichrist second was a prophet false prophet to a false word by 606 the pope had done come into to you 3:25 ad they was beginning to move into that realm y by 606 they had done change to water baptism they had done set the pope into view and he started killing the people because he's become an incarnate false prophet and remember when what we read one ago your Prophet said they were not Hypocrites they believe what they were doing was what God told them to do right that's right the Bible says that it'll come to a time that what is it father will be against son son against father mother against this mother-in-law against that all kind of things why because people believe they're right right what stage are you and I in I'll quit right what stage are we in not to change the title brother Joe race out that second seal and this put people this what people on there cuz that's what we are how easy is it to be deceived amen oh but I can't be deceived what people quote that from Brother they don't never go over there and find the one where he said frankly it get them messed up that's right and if he didn't cut the work short I'm quoting him he said there'd be no flesh saved oh but that means on over there I don't believe it I know the bride cannot be deceived and take them to hell that's right that's right but what do you think has taken all the people to the Grave right when Martin Luther the great man the preacher just shall live by faith in God ring down through Glory with that yet he turned around and said the Jews ought to be killed that they were Antichrist right why because he was not a prophet he was under the man and he couldn't come forth with the last day message right you see Church how easy is it for us to be deceived amen right like I told you I went to preach for a brother one time and I thought he believed the message I preached simple little message i k p Bap and the Holy Ghost and I encourage people with a simple statement I've always made to you how many you ever heard this statement I'd rather go through life seeking God for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and come to the end of the road and find out I've got it than to go through life thinking I got it wind up in the road and find out I don't have it how many times ever made that statement probably about 8,432 you know or 31 but I preached a simple little message a brother got mad at me another brother told me that that brother's mad at you I went to his house when I found out he was mad at me I said what are you mad about you come here and preached in my church that I had my people build on the word and said you got him to seeking God I said brother I apologize for preaching in your church something you didn't believe I thought you were a Pentecostal that believed in justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost I apologize for preaching something you don't believe but I will never apologize for getting people to seek God I will never do that amen I want you to se God until you know that's right that you you know come on that you know what's right right that you know God lives right you know that there is a God that's real yes not a mythology not a thought in your mind but to know that he's real am and you know what he's so real he'll talk to you he'll just fellowship with you if you'll let him amen you'll come right down and talk to you right in the middle of the night what's the matter you don't believe in the kind of God no God only speaks to the prophet well it's like some of them said one time that I was a prophet and I withstood it from the pull pit and said I am not a prophet in the fivefold ministry they would say when I was going up said I was a prophet in the fivefold ministry I said no that's wrong I am not a prophet in the fful ministry I said well the word comes to you my Prophet said the word comes to the spirit fi so then if you'll take it that we're all prophets in the body of Christ I'll go along with you if you're saying we're all prophets in the body because this is a prophetic age that we're living in then I'll go along with you 100% I don't have the ministry of a prophet if you going to make me anything make me a teacher leave it alone why because God is here to deal in your heart and your life I loved it years ago when I read where the Propet said when the prophets come and it took a long time to study that now but you see on the day of Pentecost on the zeusa street the Holy Ghost came back brother R said in a great prophet to every Born Again believer on ausus Street had the baptism of the Holy Ghost the great prophet the Holy Spirit ever born again believer today has within you the prophet of God am but this is the prophetic Agee amen but that way we just don't build up nobody you said well why don't you tell the truth I'm trying my best to tell the truth I'm just part of the body of Christ you get to looking at me as a prophet you'll try to get me to discern out things in your life and tell you different things that won't work cuz I don't have a gift sure God has spoke to me well I a witness she told me last night B my head Sara she punched me what's the matter I tried to tell her but I couldn't I saw something sure that's fine but you can do the same pain if you just yield yourself to God and believe him he wants to deal with you the same as he does everybody else I don't make nothing out of any of us he makes a great God Among Us Amen to reveal itself the hour that we living understand how easy is it to be deceived all we got to do is believe Satan's life brother said believe Satan's life is what serve Satan what he said go ahead brother 139 spir book anybody have a need open I'm rejoicing I for the hand of God all my life I see and the
