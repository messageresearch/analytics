[0:00] morning God bless you it's good to be
[0:02] here with
[0:03] you if you have your Bibles let's turn
[0:05] to James chapter
[0:07] 2 verse
[0:20] 21 if we could just bow our heads father

[0:36] touch every body touch every need Lord
[0:38] and Reveal Your word to us help us get
[0:40] closer to you Lord and get a Fuller and
[0:42] and more developed revelation of who you
[0:44] are in the person name of Jesus Christ I
[0:45] pray amen amen amen so James chapter 2:
[0:52] 21 was not Abraham Our Father justified
[0:56] by works when he had offered Isaac his
[0:59] son upon the altar if we could let's
[1:02] turn to Genesis CH
[1:17] 22 22:1
[1:21] 15 and talks about the sacrifice that AB
[1:25] Abraham made and he says and the angel
[1:27] of the
[1:28] Lord this is after you know he he went
[1:31] in faith to sacrifice his son and then
[1:33] the Lord provided a lamb and this is
[1:36] this is the the after effects of that in
[1:39] verse 15 and the angel of the Lord
[1:40] called unto Abraham Out of Heaven the
[1:42] second time and said by myself have I
[1:44] sworn sayeth the Lord for because thou
[1:46] Hast done this thing and has not
[1:48] withheld thy son thine only son that in
[1:51] blessing I Will Bless thee and in
[1:54] multiplying I will multiply thy seed as
[1:56] the stars of the heaven and as the sand
[1:59] which is upon this Seashore and thy seed
[2:01] shall possess the Gate of his
[2:03] enemies and in thy seed shall all
[2:05] nations of the earth be blessed because
[2:08] thou Hast obeyed my voice so I've kind
[2:12] of been teaching uh James to my students
[2:14] and and this is part of James is is a
[2:16] very I feel is a very demanding book it
[2:19] it Demands a lot from you you know it it
[2:21] builds on your faith but it all says we
[2:23] can't just have faith you must also have
[2:25] works and and with those works you know
[2:27] he's saying that's in James is talking
[2:29] about Abraham and how he was justified
[2:31] by works when he offered his son to be
[2:34] sacrificed and as the scripture says you
[2:36] know it is it was because Abraham obeyed
[2:39] is why God blessed him and and so there
[2:41] so we can see there there's a causal
[2:43] relationship between obedience and
[2:45] blessings and because that that
[2:47] obedience you know that that's where
[2:50] that's where the blessings came from so
[2:51] if you're looking for something in your
[2:53] life to correct if you're wondering you
[2:54] know what's going on why why am I you
[2:57] know may sometimes you get short
[2:58] tempered or sometimes you get upet about
[3:00] things maybe you need to look in the
[3:02] word and see if you're really obeying
[3:03] the scriptures maybe you need to analyze
[3:05] and examine your life and see if that
[3:07] obedience to the word is there because
[3:09] if you're out of obedience then you will
[3:12] suffer the consequences you will stray
[3:14] further and you're going to notice it in
[3:15] your life at work in your home you're
[3:17] going to notice those things but there's
[3:19] a causal relationship between obedience
[3:21] and blessings and it's good to remember
[3:23] that you go back to James chapter 2
[3:26] verse 22
[3:31] see is thou how Faith wrought with his
[3:34] works and by his works with was Faith
[3:37] made perfect so Faith can't be made
[3:40] perfect without works you know we have
[3:42] to have both faiths and works we can
[3:44] believe and we can say you know God
[3:46] knows my heart and and God sees the
[3:48] hearts of man but the heart your heart
[3:50] will be expressed on the outside that's
[3:51] why we say that inside man is going to
[3:53] work its way out and you're going to
[3:55] display those at just not going to
[3:56] you're not going to you know hide your
[3:57] light under a bushel but it's going to
[3:59] shine and people are going to see it and
[4:00] it's not going to be something that's
[4:01] hidden or you're not not not a secret
[4:04] Christian but it's going to be something
[4:06] that that everyone knows that everyone
[4:07] can see through your life through the
[4:08] way you speak through the things things
[4:09] you say through the things you don't say
[4:11] through the places you don't go the
[4:13] things you do they're going to they're
[4:14] going to be able to tell what what type
[4:16] of life you're
[4:17] living in verse 23 and the scripture was
[4:21] fulfilled which saith Abraham believed
[4:23] God and it was imputed unto him for
[4:25] righteousness and he was called the
[4:27] friend of God now that's a wonderful
[4:30] thing to be called a friend of God so
[4:33] when we look at like so a lot of you
[4:36] know sometimes people think that the
[4:37] Bible is a book of rules it's dos and
[4:39] don'ts and then and they're lacking that
[4:41] that relationship with God they're
[4:43] lacking that friendship with God to be
[4:45] considered a friend of God and it's it's
[4:46] not just about do this or do that but
[4:49] it's truly about knowing who God is and
[4:52] and if everyone just get the desire to
[4:54] know who God is and know what God wants
[4:57] and to consider what God wants in your
[4:59] life consider what God considers
[5:01] righteous you know sometimes we just go
[5:02] through our lives and we we think things
[5:04] are supposed to be done a certain way
[5:05] based on how we were raised or the
[5:07] country we grew up in or or or different
[5:09] things like that but if we consider what
[5:11] does God think about this and we get a
[5:14] lot further and we we we tribute a lot
[5:16] nicer to each other for
[5:18] sure um verse
[5:21] 24 ye seen then how that by works man is
[5:26] Justified and not by faith only likewise
[5:29] also so was not Rahab the Harlot
[5:31] justified by works when she had received
[5:32] the messengers and had sent them out
[5:35] another
[5:37] way
[5:39] and it's such an interesting thing that
[5:41] cuz you know sometimes people try to get
[5:43] very legalistic
[5:45] and in the dos and don'ts but we see
[5:47] that Rahab when when she she hid the
[5:50] spies that was illegal that was against
[5:53] the law and then she lied to the spies
[5:55] lied to the people who were looking for
[5:56] them and told them to go away now we
[5:58] don't believe in lying but God we know
[6:00] that God under is understanding God he
[6:02] understands context he understands you
[6:05] know what Rahab did there was not of
[6:07] evil thing but it it was actually good
[6:09] and it was for the service of Israel so
[6:11] that they could you know get an
[6:12] advantage against the amalekites who
[6:14] were seeking to destroy them so so God
[6:17] understands the context and he
[6:19] understands that you know when there are
[6:21] these rules when the law is there but we
[6:23] have to look at the Spirit of the law to
[6:24] see what what the law is actually there
[6:26] for you know and Jesus that's why Jesus
[6:28] when was here he said you know uh man
[6:30] wasn't made for the Sabbath the Sabbath
[6:32] was made for man so it's not that you
[6:34] know I mean and and he healed someone on
[6:36] the Sabbath and they just thought oh how
[6:38] could you do this on the Sabbath you
[6:39] know and and he's like well man isn't
[6:41] made for the Sabbath the Sabbath is made
[6:43] to serve man it's not that man is is
[6:45] just to be fod for the Sabbath and that
[6:48] you know if someone has a need we just
[6:49] let it go under the table because you
[6:52] know we need to uphold the laws and
[6:53] traditions but it's truly that God is
[6:55] trying to help people God loves people
[6:57] and he he wants to heal people he wants
[6:58] to to those needs and he understands you
[7:01] know if there's something like if
[7:03] someone's sick and they can't make it to
[7:05] church or or something's going on in
[7:06] someone's life he understands those
[7:08] things it's not just about the law the
[7:09] law the law but it's truly God has an
[7:12] understanding and that's why even though
[7:14] we see when Rahab even even technically
[7:16] she did something that was illegal and
[7:18] she lied that actually saved her and her
[7:21] family cuz God understands that he's not
[7:23] an unfeeling uncompromising he he
[7:26] understands context he understands
[7:28] different situations that's why he know
[7:30] that's why he knows that if if you're
[7:32] cow stuck in a ditch he's not going to
[7:34] strike you down for that he understands
[7:36] the context behind those things and and
[7:38] it's and sometimes people tend to forget
[7:41] that you know and they just kind of
[7:42] enforce the law enforce the law but
[7:44] there's there's feeling behind the law
[7:45] there's love behind the law the the
[7:47] reason why the law was made was to serve
[7:49] man not not that man should serve the
[7:51] law and and just be unfeeling and not
[7:53] care if someone has a need or or
[7:56] something they're going through to to
[7:57] always be mindful of those things
[8:00] and verse 26 for the body without the
[8:03] spirit is dead so faith without works is
[8:07] dead
[8:08] also and we'll go on to chapter 3 verse
[8:13] one my brethren be not many Masters
[8:16] knowing that we shall receive the
[8:19] greater
[8:20] condemnation so master in this context
[8:23] uh more so means a teacher and and this
[8:27] idea that that John is talking about
[8:29] that you know those who are Masters
[8:31] those who are teachers those who are or
[8:33] perhaps a leader or have a position in
[8:35] the church they shall receive the
[8:37] greater condemnation because there's a
[8:38] greater responsibility on these people
[8:40] this this idea is is collo colloquially
[8:44] expressed as with great power comes
[8:47] great responsibility many people have
[8:48] heard that phrase but that's kind of
[8:50] maybe a modern uh interpretation of it
[8:53] but it's it's those who have a more
[8:56] power you know need to wield that power
[8:57] correctly because we know that power
[8:59] power apart from character is satanic so
[9:02] when when someone is given a position a
[9:04] role in the church or a role in anywhere
[9:06] they need to have a certain Integrity or
[9:08] character about them to so that they can
[9:10] reinforce the law or or whatever their
[9:13] their their job is in accordance with
[9:16] you know what God wants in accordance
[9:18] with righteousness essentially yes
[9:21] because you must have character in order
[9:23] to wield power and and you'll be more
[9:25] responsible for for what the things you
[9:26] say and the things you do if you have a
[9:29] position if you've been given authority
[9:30] over people and and unlike you know in
[9:33] the world it seems like the higher up
[9:34] you go in power the more people you're
[9:37] in charge of and the more people you
[9:38] have to kind of you know point and they
[9:41] have to go a certain way but in the
[9:43] Christian hierarchy the more the higher
[9:45] up you go the more of a servant you are
[9:46] even Jesus said you know the greatest
[9:48] among you will be your servant you know
[9:50] and there's things that maybe uh we
[9:52] could do that maybe brother Wade
[9:54] couldn't do he couldn't just go go
[9:55] somewhere and not tell us where he's
[9:56] going or and then we come to church and
[9:58] we don't know where our Pastor is and
[10:00] where everyone's looking around and
[10:01] everyone's kind of getting uh you know
[10:03] flustered or hot and they're wondering
[10:05] what's going on where's you know he he
[10:07] has to tell us these things he has to
[10:09] you know he has to be here at church or
[10:11] if he's not here he has to tell somebody
[10:12] and communicate with us or if someone's
[10:15] you know needing some type of counseling
[10:17] or help and the scripture says that you
[10:19] can go to wise counsel and he has to
[10:20] kind of be there for those needs and
[10:22] there's certain duties that he has to
[10:23] fulfill that maybe a regular
[10:25] congregation member wouldn't have to
[10:26] fulfill they can just go home and or
[10:28] they can just go another the church and
[10:29] not tell anybody but brother way can't
[10:31] just up and leave one day and say well
[10:32] I'm going to this church and y'all have
[10:34] fun over here but no he he has to
[10:36] communicate these things and and and and
[10:38] it's a it's a service that has to be
[10:40] done Hey Brother the way it's a service
[10:44] it really is it really is a service uh
[10:46] to us and to the congregation and and to
[10:49] any congregation that a pastor might
[10:51] reside over or any Deacon or Minister
[10:53] you know there there is a service being
[10:55] done there in the same way that Jesus
[10:57] you know the the epitome of of anything
[11:00] we could think of was a servant and he
[11:02] he submitted himself and he he died upon
[11:04] a
[11:06] cross
[11:09] and and it's also important to know that
[11:11] Masters or teachers you know they they
[11:14] they receive the greater condemnation
[11:16] but it doesn't mean that other people
[11:17] don't have a a Ministry you know and
[11:19] that's that's kind of what people kind
[11:21] of get into this trap where like they
[11:22] kind of want they want a position they
[11:23] want to do something they want to have
[11:25] some type of influence you know and
[11:29] they kind of seek that position out
[11:30] because they they want that and and well
[11:32] first off that's the wrong attitude to
[11:34] have going into that position but also
[11:37] it's not that if you're not a master or
[11:39] a teacher of some sort that you're not
[11:41] important or valuable or have a Ministry
[11:44] you know cuz and that's where brother
[11:45] brandom the brothers can pull up that
[11:47] quote brother Bram talks about this and
[11:50] how go he goes over the Catholic church
[11:52] and how they kind of say the lady
[11:54] doesn't have anything to say or the
[11:55] people you know don't have a Ministry
[11:57] but he talks about how God is an
[11:58] individual ual God and he can give his
[12:00] Spirit individually to different people
[12:02] and maybe someone who never preaches or
[12:04] never gets off find the pulpit can just
[12:06] say something to you that could that
[12:07] could bless your life and it could just
[12:10] it could change your life and they might
[12:11] never ever preach but you'll know what
[12:13] they did for you and God God will use
[12:15] them in that way and the brothers could
[12:17] pull up the
[12:26] quote yes that's why no man can ever
[12:28] come along and say the holy man is a
[12:31] pope or the holy man is a bishop or
[12:33] priest the holy man is Christ the holy
[12:37] spirit in us how dare the hierarchy
[12:39] declare the leoty has no word to say
[12:42] each one has something to say each has a
[12:43] work each has a Ministry the Holy Ghost
[12:46] came at Pentecost and separated himself
[12:49] on
[12:51] each he separated he separated himself
[12:54] on each that it might be fulfilled
[12:56] whereof Christ said at the day you shall
[12:59] know that I am in my father and ye in me
[13:01] and I in you John 14:20 The Great I Am
[13:04] the almighty God has come as a spirit to
[13:06] fill his true church he has a right to
[13:08] move anywhere he wants to and upon
[13:10] anybody he wants to we don't make any
[13:13] holy men amongst us but the whole true
[13:15] Congregation of the Lord Is Holy because
[13:18] of the presence of the Holy Spirit it is
[13:21] he the holy spirit that is Holy not the
[13:24] congregation
[13:26] itself you know and and and it's such a
[13:29] a powerful quote and and and sometimes
[13:31] we can see some of those that's maybe
[13:33] one of the bigger issues in in this
[13:35] message perhaps is that some people try
[13:36] to deify brother brandom and make him a
[13:39] holy man and they lift his name and
[13:41] that's why you sometimes when you go to
[13:42] some places like uh Indiana or Arizona
[13:45] there sometimes there's some strange
[13:47] things going on because people think
[13:48] that those places are special because
[13:51] the prophet lived there and oh there
[13:53] there's something special about this
[13:54] place because you know he was here but
[13:57] Holiness is not about the place or the
[13:59] person but it's about the spirit it's
[14:01] wherever the spirit resides is where
[14:02] it's holy cuz this this is just a
[14:04] building but when we get Believers here
[14:06] when we know people who who understand
[14:07] the message who have a desire for God
[14:09] and we gather and and we and we come
[14:12] looking to praise God looking to to
[14:13] glean something from the Lord to see
[14:15] what the God would have for us to do in
[14:17] our lives that then then it brings his
[14:19] Spirit Here and Now becomes holy that
[14:21] that that's where the anointing comes
[14:22] from you know I mean we we could all go
[14:25] to Israel and we could stand where Jesus
[14:26] stood and it wouldn't get us any closer
[14:28] you know to his spirit and to who he is
[14:31] any closer of an understanding it
[14:33] wouldn't make us any Holier you know
[14:35] we're not you know Muslims who have to
[14:36] take a trip to the Mecca in once in
[14:38] their life just to to to fulfill that
[14:40] scripture or or or the Quran but we we
[14:43] understand that God can come to us
[14:45] wherever we go you know if we have God
[14:47] living in us then he'll he'll go
[14:48] wherever we go he'll go with us and he
[14:50] won't forsake us that's right so that's
[14:52] when the that that's where the Holiness
[14:54] comes from it's not from any any work or
[14:56] action or or or place or person but it's
[14:59] the spirit that dwells just same with
[15:00] Pentecost there's nothing special about
[15:02] the upper room but when the right Mighty
[15:04] rushing wind came through then there was
[15:05] something special about it and there's
[15:07] something special about those
[15:09] people so and and you just think about
[15:11] the burning bush you know when Moses was
[15:12] just he was just taking care of sheep
[15:15] and you know 30 minutes ago it was a
[15:17] bush but then the Holy Spirit comes down
[15:19] and then there's a fire and then but the
[15:21] bush isn't consumed and then he speaks
[15:23] to Moses through that bush but before
[15:26] that it was just a bush but when the
[15:27] angel of the Lord be came then it was
[15:29] Holy Ground And it to take off his shoes
[15:32] but there's nothing different about the
[15:34] dirt it was just the spirit that was
[15:35] there so don't get obsessed with a
[15:38] church or a person or a place it's just
[15:41] dirt but if the spirit could come down
[15:44] then we have that's where the power is
[15:45] so we're always looking for that Spirit
[15:47] not looking for any anything fancy not
[15:50] looking to be entertained but simply
[15:51] looking for the spirit of the Lord to be
[15:54] where we
[15:55] are and you brother Brandon you know
[15:58] emphasized
[16:00] how he emphasized how anytime he was he
[16:04] was on the pulpit he was looking for the
[16:05] guidance of the spirit and especially in
[16:07] prayer lines you would see he was he
[16:10] would he would kind of wait and and he
[16:11] would say things like well just put your
[16:14] head down or you know be reverent and
[16:17] just you know how many believes how many
[16:19] believes the Lord is true and then and
[16:20] he just kind of say things like that and
[16:22] he's kind of he's kind of stalling and
[16:24] and and one time he addresses that
[16:26] comment and he says brother BR you might
[16:28] say said uh congregation like you might
[16:30] say I'm stalling and you'd be absolutely
[16:32] right cuz I'm waiting for the spirit I'm
[16:34] waiting for this without the spirit I'm
[16:36] completely helpless is what he said
[16:38] right and he he's he's waiting and he's
[16:40] kind of just taking his time and doesn't
[16:43] want to you know just jump into it you
[16:45] know cuz he he did that before where he
[16:47] tried to jump ahead of a
[16:48] vision and he tried to well this baby's
[16:51] going to get healed and I saw it in the
[16:52] vision but the vision it wasn't quite
[16:54] what he saw in the vision so he just
[16:56] tries to well I'll just pray for it now
[16:58] and and it'll get
[16:59] taken care of and it doesn't happen
[17:01] because you can't jump ahead of the
[17:02] vision he has to completely helpless
[17:04] without the spirit of the Lord so he he
[17:07] and he was always very cautious and very
[17:10] he he always approached it with
[17:11] trepidation and and humbleness and said
[17:14] well just just bow your heads and just
[17:16] hum that softly and you know we're
[17:18] waiting on the spirit and and he would
[17:20] and then when the spirit would anoint
[17:21] him then he could say oh you I saw you
[17:23] with a red shirt over there and you're
[17:25] praying for your mother and oh I saw you
[17:27] doing this and then and then he could
[17:28] discern those things of the spirit and
[17:31] and and see discern the things in the
[17:33] people's hearts When the Spirit came and
[17:35] aided him but it was never him himself
[17:37] he always gave credit to Christ and he
[17:39] was always waiting on the spirit of the
[17:40] Lord and if he was completely helpless
[17:42] by the spirit of the Lord then none of
[17:44] us are any different you know especially
[17:45] if he's the prophet then we all have to
[17:47] to wait and be gentle and and and and be
[17:50] humble and be be cautious of that timid
[17:53] Holy Spirit and make sure that we're not
[17:55] doing anything that would you know force
[17:57] it away or even when we come to church
[17:58] and make sure that you know maybe our
[18:00] phones are off and we're not we're not
[18:02] getting distracted by things outside of
[18:03] the world but we're really trying to
[18:04] focus in and enter into the service and
[18:07] not thinking about you know as humans oh
[18:09] we're so hungry or we're so we're so
[18:11] tired I didn't get enough sleep last
[18:12] night but just just try to enter into
[18:14] the service and truly try to catch the
[18:17] spirit of the Lord because when two or
[18:18] three are gathered his spirit is here so
[18:21] you have to you have to discern and you
[18:23] have to enter in you know it's going to
[18:25] be that spirit that that comes in and
[18:27] you you have to enter into that spirit
[18:29] cuz it's here it's by scripture it's
[18:31] here amen so if you don't feel
[18:33] it be reverent amen and wait for it and
[18:38] try to try to enter
[18:39] in now James
[18:44] 3:2 for in many things we offend all If
[18:47] any man offend not in word the same as
[18:50] per perfect man and able also to Bridle
[18:53] the whole body behold we put bits on the
[18:56] horse's mouths that they obey us we turn
[18:59] about their whole body behold also the
[19:01] ships which though they be so great are
[19:04] driven of fierce winds yet are they
[19:06] turned about with a very small Helm
[19:09] whatsoever the governor
[19:11] listeth even so the tongue is a little
[19:14] member and boasteth great things behold
[19:17] how great a ma a matter a little fire
[19:20] kindleth so James has been talking about
[19:24] Works he's been talking about you know
[19:27] not just saying you believe something
[19:28] something but actually confessing it and
[19:31] and actually professing it with your
[19:33] actions and the things that you do and
[19:35] now he's he's speaking on maybe as he
[19:39] would say the maybe the hardest thing to
[19:40] tame you know he later on says that no
[19:43] man can tame the tongue so he's saying
[19:46] that if you can Bridle your tongue and
[19:48] you can be perfect in your words then
[19:49] you can be perfect and it's really that
[19:52] simple but it's not it's easier said
[19:55] than done I suppose but it's for all of
[19:58] us to to watch the things we say and and
[20:00] he gives the
[20:01] example uh I love the examples he uses
[20:04] in this book he he talks about how a
[20:07] ship and and this this gigantic ship but
[20:10] this small Rudder determines where the
[20:12] ship goes and it can take the ship
[20:14] anywhere it wants to if there's just
[20:16] just a tiny Rudder the the part of the
[20:19] ship that actually determines the
[20:20] direction of the ship is not the largest
[20:23] part of the ship and we might think we
[20:25] might see the whole boat we might see
[20:26] the big thing but what's really what
[20:29] really holds the power is just that
[20:31] small Rudder and that's why that's why
[20:33] if you can just get to the controls you
[20:35] can just take control of the whole ship
[20:37] even your car it's just a little
[20:39] steering wheel that controls your entire
[20:41] car if you can get to that steering
[20:42] wheel you can control the entire car and
[20:45] the same is with your tongue if you can
[20:46] get to your tongue if you can tame your
[20:48] tongue if you can Bridle your tongue you
[20:51] can you can take control of your whole
[20:52] spiritual life and you can it'll really
[20:54] change your life we know the power of
[20:56] words we know we know that God uses
[20:59] that he speaks things into existence and
[21:00] that his you know his thoughts aren't
[21:01] like our thoughts and when he speaks you
[21:03] know it is it is so it's not that it's
[21:05] not a matter of opinion it's not a
[21:07] matter of you know what somebody thinks
[21:09] but when God speaks it is
[21:11] truth and he even talks about
[21:16] how he talks about the ship again at the
[21:19] helm but it goes where whatever the
[21:21] governor listeth now you think of the
[21:22] power of perhaps someone of of a
[21:25] political office a prime minister a
[21:26] president a dictator whatever the case
[21:28] may be that the entire nation could
[21:32] gather around one man and if he says
[21:34] something the whole country is a war if
[21:37] he says something you know the whole
[21:39] country goes to invade another one or or
[21:41] whatever he says and and it's just the
[21:44] Power of One Man's Tongue you know if if
[21:45] the nuclear bombs drop it's going to be
[21:47] the decisions of a a small group of men
[21:51] so it's the same with our tongue the the
[21:53] power and the destruction and and all
[21:56] the things that that could transpire
[21:58] transpire could be a result of us not
[22:02] being able to control our tongues so
[22:05] that that's that's the power that a
[22:06] tongue holds and that's why the Bible
[22:08] says it's better to to do and not vow
[22:11] than if you were to vow and not do so if
[22:13] you're if you're unsure about something
[22:14] no just don't make any commitments don't
[22:16] put your foot down on anything but just
[22:19] maybe sometimes just be patient or say
[22:21] well I'm not sure and then you know it's
[22:22] better to say I'm not sure and then be
[22:23] able to do it than to say you're going
[22:25] to do it and then not show up for it is
[22:27] what the scripture has said
[22:29] CU once you made a vow you can't undo
[22:31] the vow you know and the same is true of
[22:33] anything you say you know people get
[22:35] into arguments you know you can't you
[22:37] can't you can apologize but you can't
[22:39] you can't take those words back you know
[22:41] that's why it's good to be slow to wrath
[22:43] and slow to
[22:44] speak and sometimes maybe if you're
[22:46] upset you know just go for a walk or or
[22:48] do something else but you know I mean
[22:51] Wars have started over words
[22:53] relationships are ended over words you
[22:55] know
[22:56] people families are torn apart over
[22:59] words and people get upset they get hot
[23:01] they get emotional and they say things
[23:03] they don't mean and even if you don't
[23:05] mean it you know the consequences will
[23:07] still be
[23:09] there so go for a
[23:12] walk
[23:15] Amen in
[23:17] verse
[23:19] six and the tongue is a fire a world of
[23:21] iniquity so the tongue among our members
[23:24] that it defileth the whole body and sth
[23:26] on fire the course of the nature
[23:29] and it is set on fire of hell for every
[23:31] kind of Beast of birds and of serpents
[23:34] and of things in the sea is tamed and
[23:38] hath been tamed of mankind but the
[23:40] tongue can no man tame it is an unruly
[23:43] evil full of deadly
[23:45] poison therewith we bless God even the
[23:48] father and therewith curse We Men which
[23:51] are made after the similitude of God out
[23:54] of the same mouth proceedeth blessing
[23:56] and cursing my brethren these things
[23:59] ought not so to
[24:00] be
[24:02] so just talking here on the perhaps The
[24:05] Duality of Man and and James talks about
[24:08] this a lot I mean he's talking about
[24:09] faith faith and works so of course he
[24:10] going to have to talk about the duality
[24:12] of man and he talks about earlier in
[24:14] chapter one he says the double-minded
[24:15] man is unstable in all his ways and all
[24:18] these different things where where you
[24:20] know and even I mean even in Romans you
[24:22] know it's talking about how you're
[24:24] trying to do right but your flesh is
[24:25] Waring against you and all these things
[24:28] and and and now James is talking about
[24:29] how the tame is so it's an unruly evil
[24:32] and it's so hard to tame and and we
[24:34] shouldn't you know curse and bless out
[24:36] of the same mouth but yet we do and
[24:39] that's why we need the grace of God and
[24:40] we need we need his guidance we need his
[24:42] help on
[24:43] everything but we need that's why we
[24:45] need to Bridle our tongues because you
[24:46] know when we come here to praise the
[24:48] lord we can't then go out and then you
[24:51] know say things we shouldn't say or
[24:52] curse or or swear or those different
[24:54] things or even just say hateful words
[24:56] towards one another about somebody else
[24:59] but everything that should come out of
[25:01] our tongue should be holy it should be
[25:03] yay yay or NE neigh it should not be no
[25:06] confusion or or any of anything things
[25:08] like that in verse 11 do a fountain send
[25:12] forth at the same place Sweet Water and
[25:14] bitter can the Fig Tree my brethren bear
[25:17] allive berries either of Vine fig so can
[25:20] no Fountain both yield salt water and
[25:22] fresh water and I love that example the
[25:24] Bible uses of of the vines and the figs
[25:26] and and and and we know where the random
[25:28] uses the cuab barel and and and the
[25:31] seeds and those examples where you know
[25:33] what's put in the ground you'll know
[25:35] what it is when it grows up and it and
[25:38] brings forth fruit so if we're to be
[25:40] Christians if we're to have this Faith
[25:41] you know we can't be respected of
[25:43] persons we can't we can't be giving a
[25:45] contradiction we you can't put a a grape
[25:47] seed in the ground and then you know
[25:50] apples grow up that's not it's not how
[25:51] it going to work if if that life is in
[25:53] you it's just going to produce that
[25:55] exact thing so we can't we can't have
[25:57] fresh water and salt water we can't
[25:59] those things can't mix so we have to
[26:02] purify ourselves and read the scriptures
[26:04] and and obey God and seek that that that
[26:06] friendship with God that Abraham had and
[26:09] to seek those blessings through
[26:10] obedience and through the the the
[26:13] genuine desire to follow his word that
[26:16] comes from the heart of men and in verse
[26:21] 14 but if you have bitter
[26:24] envying or verse 13 sorry
[26:29] who was a wise man and endued with
[26:31] knowledge among you let him shoot out of
[26:33] a good conversation his works with
[26:35] weekness of wisdom but if you have
[26:37] bitter envying and strife in your hearts
[26:39] Glory not and lie not against the
[26:43] truth this wisdom this wisdom descendeth
[26:47] not from above but is Earthly sensual
[26:50] devilish for where envying and strife is
[26:52] there is confusion and every evil work
[26:56] so he's once again speaking here against
[26:57] people who maybe they they feel like
[27:00] they have more knowledge or or wisdom
[27:01] than somebody and and they they try to
[27:05] use that to to exalt themselves or or
[27:07] give themselves a position or or even so
[27:10] as in verse one we're saying you know be
[27:12] not many Masters because we shouldn't
[27:14] all be Masters we shouldn't all be
[27:15] teachers but but some people he's kind
[27:18] of going back to that idea that that
[27:19] wisdom there's a certain way that wisdom
[27:22] expresses itself and it's not in a
[27:24] selfish or boastful way the same way
[27:26] that the uh the greatest should be the
[27:28] servant but some but as he talks about
[27:30] Jesus talked about you know there are
[27:31] some people who just seek that title
[27:33] they seek that representation that they
[27:35] want to be called Master they want to be
[27:36] called Rabbi and James is touching on
[27:38] that idea where people who who who have
[27:41] they might have a form of wisdom but the
[27:43] way they express it would be wrong and
[27:46] that's why he says it descendeth not
[27:48] from above it is Earthly sensual and
[27:49] devilish and that's why brother brandom
[27:51] said that apart from character apart
[27:53] from character power is is
[27:56] satanic and 17 but the wisdom that is
[27:59] from above is first pure then Peaceable
[28:02] gentle and easy to be entreated full of
[28:05] mercy and good fruits without partiality
[28:08] and without hypocrisy and the fruit of
[28:11] righteousness is sown in peace of them
[28:13] that make peace God bless you
[28:18] [Applause]
