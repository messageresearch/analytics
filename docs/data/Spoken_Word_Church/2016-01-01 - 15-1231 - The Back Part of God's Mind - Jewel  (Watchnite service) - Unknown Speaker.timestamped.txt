[1:26] I know we all have unspoken requests.

[1:45] love and grace for you and for what all
[1:48] you've done for us this year. And we're
[1:51] looking forward to a new year. And all
[1:54] things then will be made new one day.

[38:50] you know. Praise God.
[38:56] Yeah, it's good when she can come and
[38:58] just been like I told you I told him the
[39:01] other night they said, "Brother Jo, how
[39:03] you feeling?" And I tell myself, I feel
[39:05] real broke.
[39:08] I'm talking about broke.
[39:12] I mean them grandkids. I got nine
[39:13] grandkids.
[39:16] This Christmas, man. I wish they going
[39:18] to do away with the holiday. Do away
[39:19] with Christmas,
[39:23] man. You know, I mean, it's been been
[39:25] right there. What? Man, I'm trying to
[39:27] come up with a some kind of remedy, you
[39:29] know. I don't know what to come up with.
[39:31] I got two daughters or granddaughters
[39:33] and they born one born the 9th of
[39:35] January and one born the 10th of Jan uh
[39:38] no the 9th of March and one born the
[39:40] 10th of March and I'm trying to come up
[39:42] with some kind of things I could buy I
[39:44] told my wife what I'm going to do I'm
[39:46] going to buy the one that's born the 9th
[39:47] the gift and then the next day she get a
[39:50] present
[39:54] [Laughter]
[39:58] just a thought.
[40:01] Praise God. You have them kind of
[40:02] thoughts, they don't really work. I come
[40:05] up with a thought a while back several
[40:07] years ago now. I said, "I need to get my
[40:09] wife something for anniversary." And
[40:11] that's I'm going to get my wife
[40:12] something for anniversary. I don't have
[40:13] to buy her nothing for anniversary the
[40:15] rest of our marriage.
[40:17] I brought her a trophy
[40:21] and I handed it to her. She said, "I
[40:24] don't want this dumb trophy. What you
[40:25] want me to do with it?" I said, "Look
[40:27] on. I don't care what's on it. I don't
[40:29] want it.
[40:32] I thought every anniversary she can go
[40:34] look the world's greatest wife.
[40:39] It don't work in reality.
[40:41] If you're thinking that, it don't work.
[40:44] It just was a good thought I had. But
[40:47] thank God. You know one thing about God
[40:48] thoughts, they do work.
[40:51] What God thought about us is that what
[40:53] really count.
[40:53] That's right.
[40:54] So, I'm going to let you stand one more
[40:56] time. I'm just going to read a few
[40:57] scriptures here.
[41:00] Two scriptures.
[41:02] Okay.
[41:04] And I want to read uh Romans 8
[41:08] and verse 28. You know that is one
[41:11] scripture I no doubt been read. No doubt
[41:13] people read it everywhere. But then I
[41:15] said, do we really catch what it means?
[41:18] Because we think it's everything work
[41:20] together for the good. You lose a loved
[41:22] one, somebody get killed or some major
[41:25] act, something happened. First thing you
[41:27] got to do, we question how can this be
[41:29] the will of God,
[41:30] right?
[41:31] But God got everything in his to
[41:33] control.
[41:34] So Romans 8 verse 28,
[41:37] Paul speaks here.
[41:40] And y'all wouldn't mind. I guess it'll
[41:42] help my eyes a little bit.
[41:44] Now, I'm one thing about when you get
[41:45] older, if you like it when something
[41:47] like this is
[41:48] size got some good points,
[41:49] right?
[41:50] Amen. Amen. sis some good boys. He said,
[41:52] "And we know all things work together
[41:55] for the good to them that love God."
[41:58] To them who are the call according to
[42:02] his purpose.
[42:04] So now we looking at this here. You say,
[42:06] "But I I thought it going to work this
[42:08] way." But you looking at your purpose,
[42:10] but we talking about his purpose
[42:12] tonight.
[42:14] Uh, Revelation
[42:16] one
[42:20] to be uh working for his purpose. We got
[42:22] to see him in the light of Revelation 1
[42:25] verse 8.
[42:26] Hallelujah. It's working for his
[42:28] everything working together for the
[42:29] good. That mean that we got to he got to
[42:32] know all things. So now he say I am the
[42:35] alpha
[42:36] and omega
[42:38] the beginning and the end.
[42:40] How can God miss it? How can we be when
[42:44] it when it's happen to us? How can we
[42:46] say it ain't working out? He said, "I
[42:48] know the beginning and the end,
[42:51] said the Lord, which is which was and
[42:54] which is to come, the Almighty." Let us
[42:56] pray.
[42:58] My gracious father,
[43:00] help me one more time
[43:03] to yield my mind, my body, my spirit, my
[43:07] soul to you, God. Father, just help me,
[43:09] Lord, to get out of the way. Father, I
[43:11] trust God that you break all tightness
[43:13] of this day. Father, we all human and we
[43:16] all in our bodies. But God, I trust God
[43:18] that you break every tide spirit that
[43:20] would try to uh come upon us, oh God,
[43:22] tonight. Father God, give us strength
[43:25] now. I commit my whole body and soul
[43:27] spirit to you in Jesus Christ's name.
[43:29] Amen.
[43:30] God bless you. You may be seated one
[43:32] moment. Thank the Lord
[43:34] for the reading of the mind uh the
[43:35] reading of the word of God tonight. H we
[43:38] want to thank God this evening that we
[43:40] realize that all things work together
[43:43] for the good of them that love God
[43:45] called according to his purpose. In
[43:47] other words, I want to take a dog a
[43:49] thought from there on the back part of
[43:51] God mind. Amen.
[43:53] Everybody talk about I want to talk
[43:54] about what did God think about you.
[43:57] Hallelujah. I want to go back in when
[43:59] God before there was a star before there
[44:02] was a molecule. I knew God had something
[44:04] in his mind.
[44:05] He had a bride in his mind. He didn't
[44:08] wear s before I start I like to read one
[44:11] quote to start off with Christ the
[44:14] mystery of God revealed.
[44:15] Amen.
[44:16] He didn't want to look at the back part
[44:17] of God in mind for a minute.
[44:19] Exactly.
[44:20] Hallelujah. He said now God's secret
[44:24] mystery.
[44:26] He got it up here now.
[44:28] God's secret mystery he had before the
[44:30] what?
[44:31] World began.
[44:32] Before the what?
[44:33] World began.
[44:34] Hallelujah. God. You think it ain't no
[44:36] mistake in God.
[44:37] How do you say, "Brother Jo, I failed."
[44:39] God knew where you fell down. God knew
[44:42] where you got up. He knew you before the
[44:44] world ever began.
[44:46] He said, "Now, in the back part of God
[44:48] mind, there was something that he was
[44:52] was trying to trying and was going to
[44:56] achieve and he had a motive in doing
[45:00] it in order to let himself be what?
[45:04] Because first there was not there was
[45:07] not even a a scar a a a moon a star a
[45:12] molecule at Adam or molecule or
[45:15] anything. He was what
[45:18] and but but exactly was not God at that
[45:22] time
[45:23] because God is the object of worship and
[45:26] there was nothing to worship him.
[45:28] So in his great what
[45:31] he wanted those what to do what?
[45:35] And in him was what?
[45:37] In him was what?
[45:39] In him was what?
[45:40] In him was to be a savior. In him was to
[45:44] be a what?
[45:45] Hallelujah. I say he got it all in one
[45:47] big package.
[45:48] Hallelujah. You say, "I need a healer."
[45:50] He's a healer already.
[45:52] He was a healer before you ever existed
[45:54] because that was his attributes. Right.
[45:57] And all these great attributes that we
[46:00] that we see already expressed, they were
[46:03] what?
[46:04] So we want to talk on the back part of
[46:07] God mind. Hallelujah. In the word in the
[46:09] word people say, "Well, brother Joel, I
[46:11] want to I want to talk a few minute
[46:13] before we start." I look I be getting a
[46:15] lot of people base that revelation on.
[46:17] Brother Joel, I know I was called.
[46:20] You better know more than that
[46:22] because calling on me. is I know God
[46:26] called me. Hallelujah. Don't base your
[46:27] revelation on your call. You better base
[46:30] your revelation. God chose you.
[46:32] Cuz many are called but few are chosen.
[46:35] I show you in the way. You said,
[46:36] "Brother Joy, what I'm trying to say
[46:39] before the world ever begin, God knew
[46:41] who you was."
[46:43] Hallelujah. You said, "Brother Joy, I I
[46:46] made up my mind." No, you didn't make up
[46:47] your mind.
[46:48] Hallelujah. God knew what was in you
[46:51] before you ever existed. Right.
[46:53] So, you know what? Romans Romans 9 and
[46:56] verse 11-13.
[47:00] Romans 9 11 through 13. Watch out. Paul
[47:03] eating this up here.
[47:05] Anyway, he's speaking in here because
[47:07] you thinking when I brother, how did I
[47:10] get in God? What made me what? What part
[47:12] of me that was in God? The part that was
[47:14] in God that God had you in part of his
[47:17] word before the world ever began. You
[47:20] didn't just didn't come to I'm going to
[47:22] make myself the word. You always were
[47:24] part of God word and God is expressing
[47:27] himself
[47:28] in you right now.
[47:30] Amen.
[47:30] He said for he for the church is not
[47:33] being yet what
[47:35] neither have done any what?
[47:38] Come on.
[47:39] Right.
[47:39] How did God do this? He ain't done no
[47:41] good of evil.
[47:42] Hallelujah. He said done any good or
[47:44] evil. That the purpose of God according
[47:46] to election might what? Amen.
[47:49] Not of works,
[47:50] but of him that what?
[47:52] For it was said unto her, the elder
[47:55] shall serve the what?
[47:57] And it is written.
[47:58] Jacob I have what?
[48:01] For Esau I have hated.
[48:03] How can God make a decision and neither
[48:06] boy was born? Because God knew what was
[48:08] in the word
[48:09] and the word and the seed
[48:11] and God knew what he put in the seeds.
[48:13] That's right. Amen.
[48:16] How should we begin to look here? So I
[48:18] begin to think on this look here on call
[48:21] me and chosen. How many people I want to
[48:23] be chosen of God? How that why brother
[48:25] man preaches a message choosing of a
[48:27] bride
[48:28] somebody that you got in your mind a
[48:31] praying for
[48:32] somebody that's in the back part of your
[48:34] mind that going to be my wife. I'm going
[48:36] to choose her. That that that ain't she
[48:38] looking you are looking for her. Right.
[48:40] All right.
[48:41] Hallelujah. So choosing I look at the
[48:44] revelation tell us here in the word God
[48:47] word we not just only called
[48:49] but we are in other word but we are also
[48:52] called and chosen in the way he said him
[48:55] he said they who was with him are called
[48:59] and chosen and faithful.
[49:02] Right. And also it also Paul said in
[49:05] Ephesians Ephesians 1 verse4 according
[49:08] he as he has what
[49:10] chosen us
[49:12] in him before the foundation of the
[49:14] world that we shall be holy and without
[49:17] blame with our blame before him in love.
[49:20] So he talking about chosen I do not
[49:22] mistakes God have talked about I have
[49:25] chose you
[49:26] Paul you cannot blasphe the holy ghost.
[49:29] No,
[49:30] I say Paul cannot blasphe the Holy
[49:32] Ghost. And then you done enough to
[49:34] blasphe the Holy Ghost. He should have
[49:35] went to hell.
[49:37] But God chose Paul.
[49:38] He said, "You are a chosen vessel to
[49:40] me."
[49:41] I knew God called him and chose him.
[49:44] You know, thank God he looked at us that
[49:46] way
[49:47] cuz we all been in bad shape.
[49:50] But God had a purpose in the back part
[49:52] of his mind.
[49:53] So now I'm going to begin to look at
[49:55] order to understand. Let's just try to
[49:57] break this down in my I just have to do
[50:00] it the way God showed me.
[50:02] So we want to look here. Let's just go
[50:04] and look at the back part of God mind.
[50:06] Let us go to Genesis 1.
[50:09] Genesis 1 and we're going to read verse
[50:12] one.
[50:14] There god everything that God did.
[50:17] Genesis 1 and verse one. Let's just look
[50:21] at this simple scripture here. It didn't
[50:23] start off with everything. just started
[50:25] off with a simple expression
[50:27] of God.
[50:28] You think about it start off boom with
[50:30] lightning and fireworks.
[50:32] It started off with a thought express.
[50:34] It say in the beginning
[50:37] God created
[50:39] the what
[50:41] and the earth.
[50:42] If you notice it was in the beginning.
[50:45] So if it had a beginning it got to have
[50:48] an ending somewhere.
[50:49] Let me show you that word God made. He
[50:52] when we see the earth, why did God
[50:54] create the earth? Hey, he had a a plan
[50:57] in his mind.
[50:58] And in the earth, your body was in the
[51:00] earth. My body was in the earth. God
[51:02] body was in the earth
[51:04] and he created earth
[51:05] because God was going to put skin on
[51:07] himself.
[51:08] The whole revelation is that God was
[51:10] going to put skin on him.
[51:12] Hallelujah. So in the beginning, God
[51:13] created the heaven and the earth because
[51:15] God knew one day he got to have a body
[51:18] to express love. I had to express I mean
[51:21] to express a healer to express a savior
[51:24] he could not a word he had to to be a
[51:26] healer he had to come in that way to
[51:28] fully express that attribute he had a
[51:31] good skin on himself
[51:33] so here he was
[51:34] amen
[51:34] so we look at here in the beginning God
[51:37] created the heavens and the earth
[51:40] right
[51:40] in other words so he had to have
[51:42] something that could actually he would
[51:44] create himself
[51:46] so he could so he can die
[51:48] because in the in the supernatural realm
[51:50] of God couldn't die.
[51:51] If he stayed in the form of God, he
[51:53] couldn't die. But he put a beginning on
[51:55] it. So that body come out with the
[51:58] beginning of the creation of God.
[52:00] So God can go to the cross.
[52:02] Amen.
[52:03] Hallelujah.
[52:05] Yes, sir.
[52:05] So look at here. Let take it here a
[52:08] little step for. So God had this plan in
[52:11] his mind. He wasn't going to lose. He
[52:13] was not going to It looked like
[52:15] everything was going. It looked like
[52:16] everything was out of control. But God
[52:19] got it all in control.
[52:22] He said, "What you going through
[52:23] tonight, God got it all in control.
[52:26] Whatever come your way, I God will make
[52:28] it work out
[52:30] according to his purpose."
[52:32] How do you say, "Brother, what God
[52:33] doing?" He's working on you.
[52:35] He's working on me.
[52:37] It might not be what I might not be what
[52:39] I ought to be, but one thing I know I'm
[52:41] not what I used to be. Because God is
[52:44] working on us.
[52:45] You're exactly right. Hallelujah.
[52:47] Thank you, Lord.
[52:48] He goes and says here, I want to be
[52:50] here. God had a purpose. Let look at his
[52:53] purpose here.
[52:54] He says here in the message of
[52:59] h I think Joe sweat Phoenix, Arizona.
[53:05] He'll pull it up out. Amen. Amen.
[53:08] Amen. I'm sweating. I'm sweating these
[53:11] things out.
[53:13] Sweating words out.
[53:15] That's good. Let me find my place here
[53:17] now. Okay, let me Yeah, here I am. Right
[53:20] here. He said, "Now, Adam was in the
[53:22] Garden of Eden
[53:24] when he first sinned,
[53:26] God had a way of redemption."
[53:29] Amen.
[53:30] For, you know, in other words, Adam
[53:32] wouldn't do any Adam couldn't save
[53:33] himself.
[53:34] Some people say, "Brother Joel,
[53:36] hallelujah. Adam went out and he saved
[53:37] Eve." Adam need redemption for himself.
[53:40] Adam couldn't save her. He needed
[53:42] redemption for himself. Adam to touch
[53:44] her back pulling her pulling himself
[53:47] into sin. But God cannot destroy Adam
[53:50] because Adam was part of God
[53:53] and Eve was part of him.
[53:55] So it says he say God had a way of
[53:59] redemption for him right right quick.
[54:02] Just as soon as he sinned,
[54:05] God made a way
[54:07] of redemption. Before Adam could ever
[54:09] approach back to fellowship with the
[54:12] father, God had to slay an innocent lamb
[54:17] or sheep and make him a clo to to go
[54:21] around him
[54:22] because Adam thought he could cover
[54:24] himself.
[54:25] And we think today I can cover myself by
[54:27] reading quotes.
[54:29] You can't cover yourself only by the
[54:31] blood.
[54:32] You're not saved by quote. You are saved
[54:34] by the blood of Jesus Christ. When the
[54:36] word become flesh in you, it's the
[54:38] blood.
[54:40] Hallelujah.
[54:42] How about you too far out there? You
[54:43] know how
[54:44] you got to call me crazy. My way would
[54:45] call me crazy.
[54:47] I thank God I feel this way.
[54:51] Yeah. In other words, you know, we don't
[54:53] need we don't need marijuana to get
[54:55] happy.
[54:56] We don't need wine to get happy.
[54:58] Hallelujah. You know, they they had a
[55:00] thing come out of years ago around the
[55:01] message. Drink a little wine till you
[55:02] feel stimulated. After you get a little
[55:05] revelation, you going to feel
[55:06] stimulated.
[55:07] Hallelujah. He going to take you into
[55:09] another dimension.
[55:10] How do you see God in another realm?
[55:13] Honey, it will stimulate your
[55:15] because it says here, hallelujah. Clothe
[55:19] around him. Throw and throw out
[55:22] the wagon carpet
[55:24] for Adam to walk back
[55:26] on the carpet of redemption.
[55:28] Amen.
[55:29] To come into his presence again. Amen.
[55:31] God always had a plan of redemption
[55:34] and that has been through the what?
[55:37] I don't know what people do. They done
[55:39] took the blood out of the message.
[55:40] How people could have went back to the
[55:42] thing and I can make it myself.
[55:43] Hallelujah. You can make it yourself.
[55:44] You don't need the blood.
[55:46] Hallelujah. If you could do it yourself,
[55:48] you don't need the blood. Honey, your
[55:49] body is unredeemed. Your body is not the
[55:52] good enough to approach God. But down in
[55:54] that soul where the word is, that's what
[55:56] God's looking at.
[55:58] He's not looking at your body. He
[55:59] looking at the word that's in you.
[56:02] That's right. Thank you.
[56:04] You know what I'm saying here? He says
[56:05] here, he says, "And that through the
[56:08] blood, ever since the very beginning,
[56:12] dawn of time."
[56:13] Yes, sir.
[56:14] See, that body could die.
[56:16] Cuz in the beginning when God created
[56:19] when Adam was first created, hallelu,
[56:21] Adam did not have time in his body.
[56:24] But when Adam sinned,
[56:26] in that day, he became a time creature.
[56:28] How he became a time creature.
[56:30] Hallelujah. Now, Adam got baldheaded.
[56:34] But then he didn't have to worry about
[56:35] his afro.
[56:38] It never got gray. It stayed black. He
[56:41] kept scr Why? Because in in the before
[56:44] Adam before there was a fail, Adam never
[56:46] had this in his body. But as soon as
[56:49] Adam fell,
[56:50] that day you eat the time you eat there,
[56:54] that time you die.
[56:56] Adam became a time creature. Right.
[56:57] Right.
[56:59] Exactly. Right.
[57:00] He says here in the in the dawn of time
[57:04] he preceded his mind of God. Before the
[57:07] world come into existence, God had a way
[57:10] already planned.
[57:11] Before the world was at you can see why
[57:14] brother B go back and take the scripture
[57:16] say how before how in the world there
[57:18] was a lamb that was slain before the
[57:21] foundation of the world. How God had a
[57:23] plan. He had a purpose in the back part
[57:25] of his mind. He said, "I'm going to save
[57:27] my bride." The devil going to think he
[57:29] got her because time going to come in.
[57:31] But I want to tell you what, I'm going
[57:33] to come down in time and I'm going to
[57:35] destroy time and time shall be no more
[57:38] with the revelation. Hallelujah.
[57:41] Amen.
[57:42] Hallelujah.
[57:44] Praise God. So we go here. So let's go
[57:46] deal with the time element. So you if
[57:49] you notice here, when Adam fell, Adam
[57:52] did try to cover himself.
[57:54] I mean, they made him a little cloth
[57:56] cover and a fig leaf
[57:57] and he walked out in the presence of
[57:59] God.
[58:00] And that wasn't enough to cover him.
[58:03] Hallelujah. Know where he was just a
[58:04] as he was if he didn't have that
[58:06] fig leaf right
[58:07] because God didn't call fig leaf to
[58:09] cover you.
[58:10] Hallelujah. I want to tell you people
[58:12] today. You say, "Well, I'm a
[58:13] vegetarianist. I don't believe in eating
[58:15] meat."
[58:16] I'm sorry for you missing something.
[58:21] You can now if you I'm not going to hurt
[58:23] your feeling but if you're a vegetarian
[58:25] you can't believe you don't believe the
[58:26] same message I'm kind of eagles you ever
[58:29] seen a vegetarian eagle
[58:33] eagle is a meat eater
[58:35] they take blood and take something to
[58:37] die with blood in it
[58:39] I know vegetables die we live by dead
[58:42] substance
[58:43] I want to tell you what Jesus said every
[58:45] time he raised somebody up from the sea
[58:48] he never go say go get them them
[58:49] turnups.
[58:50] He said, "Go get him some meat."
[58:52] Hallelujah. In other words, he want to
[58:54] be scra.
[58:59] So he find here.
[59:01] So they they they he tried to cover
[59:03] himself. But God had a purpose.
[59:07] Amen.
[59:07] Now, I want you to notice this.
[59:11] God could not
[59:13] he could not come down and take sin
[59:17] after the order we was born in.
[59:19] That's right.
[59:20] To do this, God would if God would have
[59:24] come the way that we come, he would had
[59:27] to come through sensation.
[59:29] But God had to come through revelation,
[59:32] the spoken word.
[59:34] Hallelujah. Had to be the thought of God
[59:36] expressed. If God would have come the
[59:38] way you come, he would have had to come
[59:40] through sensation.
[59:41] Right?
[59:42] So you find here. So he had to make a
[59:44] way.
[59:45] Remember the he had to come legal,
[59:47] right?
[59:48] You know what? You know where it had to
[59:49] be a legal interest,
[59:50] right?
[59:51] You know Jesus tell you I stand at the
[59:53] door if you know he stands at the door.
[59:56] Hallelujah. Because the door is a legal
[59:58] interest
[59:58] into a house.
[1:00:00] Hallelu door is a legal interest. I
[1:00:02] don't care who it is,
[1:00:03] right?
[1:00:04] I don't care if it's my son.
[1:00:05] Yeah. I'm in that kitchen going through
[1:00:07] my window.
[1:00:09] We going to have problems with that
[1:00:12] because my window is not the legal
[1:00:14] entrance into my house.
[1:00:16] If you want something, come through the
[1:00:17] door.
[1:00:18] If God come to the earth, he got to come
[1:00:20] through the door.
[1:00:23] I am the door to the shephold.
[1:00:26] I'm not the winner of the door.
[1:00:29] Exactly right.
[1:00:31] Amen.
[1:00:31] The legal interest.
[1:00:33] So he had to make it legal.
[1:00:34] That's right. So now what we got in
[1:00:36] here? Everything that was born
[1:00:40] after at after Eve and Adam in other
[1:00:43] word took and brought life bought new
[1:00:45] life a life upon the earth. Excuse me.
[1:00:48] What did they do? Everything come
[1:00:50] through
[1:00:51] a desire
[1:00:53] a shire really
[1:00:54] which is sensation.
[1:00:56] But if God use that plan then God can't
[1:00:58] be a perfect lamb.
[1:00:59] Hallelujah. Couldn't be a perfect lamb.
[1:01:01] All right.
[1:01:01] Because why Job disqualify him being a
[1:01:04] burn lamb
[1:01:05] because Job said a man that's born of a
[1:01:07] woman
[1:01:08] is a few days and a lot of trouble.
[1:01:10] He's a liar from the beginning.
[1:01:13] It's nothing in him that's right. But
[1:01:15] God had to be born without lies.
[1:01:18] Eve brought life through dies.
[1:01:20] Adam brought life through a lie. We born
[1:01:23] in the world shaped in iniquity.
[1:01:25] Right.
[1:01:26] You say, "Well, I ain't never told a
[1:01:27] lie." You need to repent right now.
[1:01:32] Amen.
[1:01:34] So God, what did he made a legal
[1:01:36] interest? So what he says, the woman's
[1:01:39] seed
[1:01:40] shall bruise the head of the serpent.
[1:01:42] Right?
[1:01:44] It won't happen cuz a woman ain't got a
[1:01:47] seed.
[1:01:47] Right?
[1:01:48] So if he prophesy a woman's seed, he was
[1:01:51] speaking him a body
[1:01:52] that would come through the spoken word
[1:01:55] that would take on the seed of the woman
[1:01:57] and would bruise the head of the
[1:01:58] servant. He was speaking his body into
[1:02:00] existence.
[1:02:01] God was expressing his thought. How the
[1:02:04] woman's seed
[1:02:06] had stood that day on Calvary.
[1:02:08] Take this day to finish.
[1:02:11] It is finished.
[1:02:12] Her seed bruise the head of the servant.
[1:02:15] How they show you here that what God is
[1:02:17] show. So now the prophets catches the
[1:02:20] inspiration.
[1:02:21] Do you realize every prophet in the Old
[1:02:23] Testament was only prophesying?
[1:02:26] Yep.
[1:02:27] God with skin on it. Right.
[1:02:29] Hallelujah. That's all he missed. That
[1:02:30] was the whole message.
[1:02:32] God was going to take on skin through
[1:02:34] the prophets speaking the word or they
[1:02:37] reaction to the word. It was expressing
[1:02:39] the seed of God, the woman's seed.
[1:02:43] I begin to look at these things here. I
[1:02:45] thought about Abraham.
[1:02:48] When he chose Abraham, it ain't because
[1:02:50] Abraham was a good person,
[1:02:51] right?
[1:02:52] It ain't because Abraham was such a
[1:02:54] lived in a good morally home,
[1:02:55] right? He lived down there with a bunch
[1:02:57] of elders.
[1:02:58] He lived down there with a bunch of
[1:03:00] worship all kind of gods.
[1:03:02] But God called him
[1:03:04] and chose him.
[1:03:07] That why Satan couldn't separate
[1:03:08] Abraham.
[1:03:09] And even though Abraham made many
[1:03:11] mistakes,
[1:03:12] Abraham made all kind of mistakes. He
[1:03:14] lied it up. But when Paul saw his
[1:03:16] commentary, Paul said he staggering not.
[1:03:19] What was God looking at the seed with
[1:03:21] the word that was in Abraham?
[1:03:23] Amen. Exactly. That's right. All right.
[1:03:26] That's right.
[1:03:26] See, God called Abraham out.
[1:03:28] Here go Abraham coming out.
[1:03:30] Here he coming out in his old age. Well,
[1:03:33] you know, he was up in guess 65 or
[1:03:35] whatever he was at that time. God called
[1:03:37] him out.
[1:03:38] Told him, "Go to the land. I'm going to
[1:03:39] show you and I'm going to give you a
[1:03:41] son. I'm going to give you a seed."
[1:03:43] Abraham, God waited till his body died.
[1:03:47] God waited till his body died.
[1:03:50] Cuz you know, God didn't want no human.
[1:03:52] If we could reason it out, it wouldn't
[1:03:54] be supernatural.
[1:03:56] But if your body dead
[1:03:58] Yeah. Come on now.
[1:04:00] You have a baby.
[1:04:01] Yeah.
[1:04:01] We know that's supernatural.
[1:04:05] Hallelujah.
[1:04:06] That's right.
[1:04:06] I'm preaching a while back and I was
[1:04:08] preaching on you know some people that
[1:04:10] was getting pregnant. I preached just a
[1:04:12] little girl the other day met them a
[1:04:14] while back in a church and brother come
[1:04:16] said will you preach for me brother? I
[1:04:17] said I don't mind preaching for his he
[1:04:19] was standing. I said you married he said
[1:04:20] I've been married for 15 years. I said,
[1:04:22] "Got any children?" And his wife dropped
[1:04:24] her head. I said, "Oh my God."
[1:04:27] I said, "The woman is ain't got no
[1:04:29] children,
[1:04:29] right?"
[1:04:30] And I said, "Brother," I said, "You like
[1:04:31] to have a baby?" He said, "Well,
[1:04:32] brother," he said, "We done tried that."
[1:04:35] He said, "Brother," he said, "We
[1:04:36] accepting that this, you know, that's
[1:04:38] the way it got to be." And I said,
[1:04:39] "Brother," I said, "I don't accept that
[1:04:41] to tell her to stand beside you."
[1:04:42] Right?
[1:04:43] I said, "You believe God?" He said, I
[1:04:45] said, "Don't accept that. Let her
[1:04:47] believe that God going to get a prayer."
[1:04:48] I said, "God, release her wound so she
[1:04:50] can receive a seed, straighten his seed
[1:04:51] so he can head over prayer for them.
[1:04:53] That way, soon as she go home, she get
[1:04:55] pregnant."
[1:04:56] Amen.
[1:04:56] He said, "Brother Joe, what happened?"
[1:04:57] She had the baby just two days ago.
[1:05:00] I just God is still the same God
[1:05:02] yesterday, the day of
[1:05:06] man. I was telling that testimony a 75
[1:05:09] year old woman and a man get up.
[1:05:12] I didn't My wife said, "Bro, you d you
[1:05:14] hear what she said?" I said, "No, I
[1:05:16] thought you didn't. I thought I didn't
[1:05:18] know what to say. She said, "I want a
[1:05:20] baby, too."
[1:05:24] I didn't know what to think. I thought
[1:05:26] maybe she was I just I gladly didn't
[1:05:28] know that. I said, "Lord, get this woman
[1:05:30] a body change."
[1:05:34] Cuz I feel like if she going to have a
[1:05:36] baby in her head, she going to need a
[1:05:37] body change.
[1:05:39] My wife say, "Why you pray for a body
[1:05:41] change?" I said, "But for her to have a
[1:05:43] baby, everybody been even older than
[1:05:44] that. to have a baby at the head. They
[1:05:46] were going to need a body change.
[1:05:49] The body change.
[1:05:52] So it didn't work. So it went but here
[1:05:54] it was. Here go Abraham. Abraham body
[1:05:56] died.
[1:05:58] Sarah body dried up.
[1:06:00] So why was he doing this? Because he
[1:06:02] wanted to show you that the sea was
[1:06:04] going to come through the smoke of
[1:06:05] words.
[1:06:06] The sea was going to come when
[1:06:08] everything is dead. When they say the
[1:06:10] bride can't make it in his head. They
[1:06:11] say there's too many a demon in his
[1:06:13] head. Honey, in the periest times you'll
[1:06:15] come, the bride will have the body of
[1:06:17] Christ.
[1:06:18] You ain't overcoming by yourself. You
[1:06:20] overcome by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:06:22] Hallelujah. In this wicked age.
[1:06:26] Hallelujah.
[1:06:26] Amen.
[1:06:28] Praise God.
[1:06:33] Amen. So he go here says here, so now
[1:06:36] Abraham and Sarah, so now it was time
[1:06:38] for the promise to come. So God had to
[1:06:42] come down to confirm the covenant. To
[1:06:44] confirm that covenant he made with
[1:06:45] Abraham.
[1:06:46] That's right.
[1:06:46] Hallelujah. He want to confirm that
[1:06:47] covenant.
[1:06:48] And to confirm that covenant, God had to
[1:06:51] have skin on him,
[1:06:52] right? Amen.
[1:06:53] God had to be behind a veil,
[1:06:55] right?
[1:06:55] He could have done it, but he wanted the
[1:06:57] last day promise be of God standing on
[1:07:00] earth,
[1:07:01] right?
[1:07:02] With skin on him.
[1:07:04] So God himself, he said, "It's time for
[1:07:05] me to make this come to pass."
[1:07:07] So God went down in his earth.
[1:07:10] You remember he say in the beginning
[1:07:12] God created the heavens and the earth.
[1:07:15] So God said I need to use my earth
[1:07:17] so I can make me a body to come down. So
[1:07:20] God took 16 elements out of his earth
[1:07:22] and he blowed himself and when Abraham
[1:07:24] looked up three men was coming.
[1:07:26] Hallelujah. And three men were coming to
[1:07:28] Abraham and Abraham recognized God. He
[1:07:30] recognized his Lord. He bowed himself
[1:07:33] say my Lord. He had one revelation. It
[1:07:36] don't take much to be changed. One
[1:07:38] faith, one baptism, and one love. Hold
[1:07:41] on to that.
[1:07:42] That same revelation that healed you,
[1:07:45] that same revelation that saved you when
[1:07:47] you were there, that same revelation,
[1:07:49] it'll change your body if you hold on to
[1:07:50] it.
[1:07:53] So, Abraham, come down there. He said,
[1:07:56] "My Lord." Lot saw him. He said, "My
[1:07:58] Lord."
[1:08:00] He didn't even understand the Godhead at
[1:08:01] all.
[1:08:02] Hallelujah. For even the rapture to take
[1:08:04] place, you got to have a revelation of
[1:08:05] Godhead. That's right.
[1:08:06] How you going to know what you're
[1:08:07] worshiping? Yeah.
[1:08:08] You see a God with two heads, you got a
[1:08:09] freak.
[1:08:11] Amen.
[1:08:12] Right.
[1:08:12] But he he's recognized the one God.
[1:08:16] And what did he tell Abraham? Standing
[1:08:18] with skin on it.
[1:08:19] I come to visit you.
[1:08:20] Yeah.
[1:08:21] To the time according to life.
[1:08:25] You and Sarah going to have a baby.
[1:08:27] It was too supernatural for Sarah.
[1:08:31] Come on, man. The woman was old.
[1:08:33] What you think she was going to do?
[1:08:35] This is not happening. Yeah,
[1:08:37] this is not happening. Hallelujah. Why?
[1:08:39] Because she was looking at her purpose.
[1:08:42] But God ain't looking at our purpose.
[1:08:44] He looking at what he said about us. I
[1:08:46] God said we shall overcome. We shall
[1:08:49] overcome. I don't care how we feel about
[1:08:50] it. You will overcome this age.
[1:08:55] So, so he says to Sarah, you going to
[1:08:58] have a baby.
[1:08:59] In other words, Abraham Sarah, Sarah
[1:09:01] laugh. God said, why is your she now?
[1:09:04] She's up. She's don't realize this was
[1:09:07] not a laugh.
[1:09:09] It was just in her heart.
[1:09:11] That's right.
[1:09:12] You know, sometime we got to watch what
[1:09:13] we do.
[1:09:14] Cuz it's a word in you reflects
[1:09:16] right
[1:09:17] how the attribute in you, you know, we
[1:09:18] got to be subject to the the mind of
[1:09:21] God.
[1:09:21] Cuz every time you say something, you
[1:09:23] writing part of the Bible,
[1:09:24] right?
[1:09:24] Every time ever thought that we have his
[1:09:26] writing part of the Bible. So she here
[1:09:28] go here go she laugh in her heart.
[1:09:30] Hallelujah. She lied to Holy. Why didn't
[1:09:32] Sarah lie?
[1:09:33] Said, "I didn't lie, but you did."
[1:09:35] Why God didn't kill her? Because she's
[1:09:37] part of the covenant.
[1:09:38] Abraham already was under the
[1:09:40] circumcision
[1:09:41] and she was circumcised with Abraham
[1:09:42] under the covenant through Sarah womb.
[1:09:46] Through Sarah womb, that where the baby
[1:09:48] going to go, not
[1:09:50] tell what Abraham already had a son.
[1:09:54] And he he produced a son.
[1:09:56] So Abraham didn't have a problem. Right.
[1:09:59] You know, we ought to preach in this
[1:10:01] message. I ain't going to call the
[1:10:02] country he's from. He married three
[1:10:04] wives cuz none of them couldn't get
[1:10:06] pregnant.
[1:10:07] Come to find out, he's the problem.
[1:10:14] He putting them away. You can't have my
[1:10:16] baby get. She didn't get him. I ain't
[1:10:18] got nothing. He still ain't got n.
[1:10:22] He ain't Come on, damn
[1:10:28] ain't the problem.
[1:10:31] But you know that's it.
[1:10:33] We can see that Abraham was not the
[1:10:34] problem.
[1:10:35] Sarah couldn't produce.
[1:10:37] She had a dead wound
[1:10:39] and it had dried up.
[1:10:41] But the woman seed was going to come
[1:10:43] through prophecy, not by sensation.
[1:10:45] Right. Right.
[1:10:46] And you know what I'm saying to make
[1:10:47] that promise cut back when after she was
[1:10:49] dead, God had to bring her back to life
[1:10:51] so she could receive the seed.
[1:10:53] He going to have so here Abraham was
[1:10:55] here. He was Abraham had Ishmael.
[1:10:58] God never recognized Ishmael.
[1:11:00] Right.
[1:11:01] God. Okay. You say, "Well, I was born in
[1:11:04] the me." Hallelujah. Hey, brother
[1:11:05] Brandon was my first cousin. So what?
[1:11:08] Hallelujah. My daddy was a mess preacher
[1:11:10] for yours. So what?
[1:11:11] Hallelujah. God is not doing it. God
[1:11:13] ain't got grand churches. All right.
[1:11:15] Hallelujah. You know why God would have
[1:11:16] grandchildren? Because God has
[1:11:18] grandchildren. We'll be a bunch of small
[1:11:19] brats.
[1:11:22] [Applause]
[1:11:25] Hallelujah.
[1:11:27] Yeah. Me and my daughter having a little
[1:11:28] fuss right now over this grandchild
[1:11:31] stuff.
[1:11:32] Daddy, why do the grandkids get to clam
[1:11:34] on the couch?
[1:11:36] Why do the grandkids get to go in the
[1:11:38] refrigerator? There's nothing said about
[1:11:39] it. You don't do nothing no more. You do
[1:11:42] you need a ch You need to warp them.
[1:11:43] Daddy
[1:11:46] ain't my job.
[1:11:52] I don't raise you. You got to do that
[1:11:53] now.
[1:11:55] Hey man mean you know they them grand
[1:11:57] boy. A mean my when they tell my
[1:11:59] grandson said grandpa going to get you.
[1:12:00] They said we want grandpa to whoop us.
[1:12:07] You wouldn't say that if you had a
[1:12:09] daddy. You oh mama get me.
[1:12:11] But now the ego got so relaxed they said
[1:12:13] we want dad we want grandpa.
[1:12:14] Yeah.
[1:12:17] I guess the lion doesn't roared out.
[1:12:23] Yep. And why God ain't got grand
[1:12:26] cuz God don't want to depend on him
[1:12:27] handinessing this and hand that. He want
[1:12:29] us to walk by faith.
[1:12:30] Hallelujah. God say hallelujah. You
[1:12:32] might not get it when you want it but
[1:12:34] you can hold on to the promise of God
[1:12:35] until it come to pass. You want God
[1:12:38] perfect will not permiss it. Right.
[1:12:40] Right.
[1:12:40] So you go to here, he had Ishmael.
[1:12:42] Ishmael was not Abraham's son.
[1:12:44] Right.
[1:12:45] Ishmael was Abram's son.
[1:12:47] But God had to have a only begotten son.
[1:12:49] How did the promise going to come
[1:12:50] through only begotten son? How? So he
[1:12:53] said, "Here you go. Abraham has has
[1:12:55] produced the child when they was in
[1:12:57] there all day like hund."
[1:12:59] Y.
[1:13:00] So here they was come up with a child.
[1:13:02] Y
[1:13:03] and then God let Abraham fall. He loved
[1:13:07] it as
[1:13:08] so much.
[1:13:11] He said, "Why he loved him so much?" You
[1:13:12] had a child. You was 100 years old. You
[1:13:14] gonna love him, too.
[1:13:16] So, you going to say, "Lord, I know this
[1:13:18] was a miracle."
[1:13:19] He let brother Sam
[1:13:22] and his wife, they get a baby right now,
[1:13:25] it going to be one of these other boys
[1:13:28] sat down
[1:13:30] to way going to be daddy. That's all he
[1:13:33] do. Baby that boy.
[1:13:37] Mama, every time we go down there, she
[1:13:38] got him sitting on the L. We didn't do
[1:13:39] that. And boy, if you going to do I can
[1:13:41] see right now. Way, we ain't going to
[1:13:42] get nothing.
[1:13:46] [Applause]
[1:13:48] You think that? You think they going to
[1:13:49] get something in the W? They might get a
[1:13:51] little something, but everything be that
[1:13:54] boy sitting there you way. Look at him
[1:13:55] think, boy, if I could just beat you one
[1:13:57] time.
[1:14:01] Oh yes. Abraham loved that son with that
[1:14:03] kind of love.
[1:14:04] That's right. Hallelujah. Bible. The
[1:14:06] Bible say Abraham loved him.
[1:14:08] Hallelujah. So he says here Abraham had
[1:14:10] gave 12 years
[1:14:12] of love.
[1:14:14] God had to test him
[1:14:16] and give him a Gethsemane test.
[1:14:19] Something that was real hard.
[1:14:21] Had sometimes God had to give you a
[1:14:23] Gethsemane test.
[1:14:25] Something you thought you couldn't
[1:14:26] overcome.
[1:14:27] But God want to see do you love him
[1:14:29] more than you love everything else.
[1:14:32] So after Abraham got better. He
[1:14:33] said,"Abraham,
[1:14:36] I want you to offer your only
[1:14:38] begotten
[1:14:39] right
[1:14:40] son." Right?
[1:14:41] We know that Abraham had another son.
[1:14:43] No, Abraham didn't.
[1:14:44] Right?
[1:14:44] That was under the old nature.
[1:14:46] That was under his first union.
[1:14:48] But when he got born again, his old man
[1:14:50] was done away with.
[1:14:51] God only saw one son. Hallelujah. You
[1:14:54] said, "Brother, but I done this." God
[1:14:56] don't see that. God sees you after you
[1:14:57] come to your new birth and recognize the
[1:14:59] word inside of you have been quickened
[1:15:01] to this love to a new experience
[1:15:05] till he goes he says here he says so
[1:15:08] Abraham God says now I'm going to test
[1:15:12] him
[1:15:13] I'm going to give him a
[1:15:14] Gethsemane
[1:15:15] experience
[1:15:17] Jesus the hardest battle was in
[1:15:18] Gethsemane
[1:15:20] Abraham had the battle
[1:15:21] God said offer your only begotten son
[1:15:24] Amen.
[1:15:26] You think
[1:15:27] what this was like
[1:15:29] for Abraham to say, "Lord,
[1:15:32] whatever your will is,
[1:15:34] I'll be willing to do."
[1:15:36] That would have been a hard channel.
[1:15:37] That been hard for me. Any man would
[1:15:39] have a hard battle offering his son.
[1:15:41] Amen.
[1:15:41] Especially you had this child at 100
[1:15:43] years old.
[1:15:45] Come on. You can see now Brother Sam get
[1:15:47] up there to have this baby and he's
[1:15:49] waking up in the morning and his wife
[1:15:51] standing at the door. What you going to
[1:15:52] doing, Sam? Well, God told me, "No, no,
[1:15:54] no.
[1:15:56] God ain't told you to kill my son."
[1:15:59] I know. But you better find another way
[1:16:01] out this door
[1:16:03] cuz it going to be a devil. It going to
[1:16:04] be one of the biggest fight he ever had
[1:16:06] in his house.
[1:16:07] Abraham got up early
[1:16:10] for Sarah got out of bed
[1:16:12] cuz Sarah wouldn't have been going
[1:16:13] along. If a represent a girl, right,
[1:16:17] walked in front of a 30 on six rifle
[1:16:20] to show mother love for a child, right?
[1:16:23] Everything you do like this, man. We
[1:16:24] just now come out of pig hunt and they
[1:16:26] told me to say when them pigs got babies
[1:16:28] that they they'll charge you.
[1:16:30] We went out of pig hunt and all of a
[1:16:32] sudden my buddy was standing there and
[1:16:33] this pig this little pigs all around and
[1:16:35] all of a sudden this wild boy were
[1:16:36] running straight to it and he had a spur
[1:16:40] and he said he let him get right there
[1:16:42] and he just said I said man
[1:16:45] and they said brother Joe why you didn't
[1:16:47] do it? I said Tin was a white man.
[1:16:58] No, I'm not going to do that. That what
[1:17:01] they made 306 for.
[1:17:03] I'm going to shoot that joker man
[1:17:06] standing there with a spirit man. He run
[1:17:08] at me. No sir. I'm not ready for that
[1:17:11] yet. I'm not mentally prepared. But here
[1:17:13] we are.
[1:17:14] Here we are. Here. Abraham had offered
[1:17:16] his son to God.
[1:17:19] And God said, "Abraham, I want you to do
[1:17:20] it." Abraham went with faith.
[1:17:24] So with God under him, he was
[1:17:25] expressing,
[1:17:26] right?
[1:17:27] The word that was inside of him,
[1:17:29] not the word. What word was it? It was
[1:17:31] God writing his own Bible.
[1:17:33] So Abraham got up early in the morning.
[1:17:36] They go up there to worship on this
[1:17:37] mountain here. Here they I think it was
[1:17:39] mountain uh Mariah if I'm correct which
[1:17:43] mean God provided place. Hallelujah. He
[1:17:46] was going to God provided place of
[1:17:47] worship. Here go by three days off he
[1:17:50] goes through the desert.
[1:17:51] Yeah
[1:17:51] to fight demons
[1:17:53] to fight spirits that's trying to say
[1:17:55] you can turn around.
[1:17:56] Abraham had to keep walking against
[1:17:57] human. He had to keep walking against
[1:17:59] what? Human uh his own human reason. He
[1:18:02] said I'm going with God. God said how
[1:18:04] did the offer as I'm not gonna let
[1:18:05] nothing turn me around. Ah, God tell me
[1:18:07] I'm going to make it and I'm not going
[1:18:08] to let nobody stop me. I'm going to keep
[1:18:10] walking. I'm going to keep fighting. If
[1:18:12] I fall down, I'm going to get back up
[1:18:14] and I'm going to keep pressing on
[1:18:15] because God said at the end of the day,
[1:18:18] I will make it.
[1:18:19] Hallelujah.
[1:18:20] So, you got to be He gets there to the
[1:18:23] mountain. Watch Abraham faith. He tells
[1:18:26] him,
[1:18:27] "You deacons just stay right here."
[1:18:31] Mean the lad going to go in and worship
[1:18:33] and we will return.
[1:18:35] What was he looking at? He was looking
[1:18:36] at resurrection
[1:18:37] because he knew if he killed Liza that
[1:18:40] God had to raise him up
[1:18:42] to fulfill a promise that he made and
[1:18:44] God cannot lie.
[1:18:46] Abraham was standing on faith.
[1:18:49] Amen.
[1:18:49] That's right.
[1:18:50] And the lad get he says to his father
[1:18:54] been he' been raised in the message. He
[1:18:56] went to church all his life.
[1:18:57] He says to his father, "I see the wood.
[1:19:01] Yep.
[1:19:01] I see the knife.
[1:19:03] I see the fire. Yeah.
[1:19:04] But where is the lamb?
[1:19:07] What is the sacrifice?
[1:19:09] Abraham said something.
[1:19:11] It seemed like it was just,
[1:19:13] you know, inspiration. Come on, Abraham.
[1:19:15] And he just say these simple words.
[1:19:17] God will
[1:19:19] provide for himself.
[1:19:21] A sacrifice.
[1:19:22] What was he doing? He was picking up
[1:19:24] Genesis 1.
[1:19:26] The woman's seed was prophecy.
[1:19:28] It was a supernatural act. God will
[1:19:31] create a ram
[1:19:33] for this offering right here.
[1:19:35] Hallelujah. He was speaking the word the
[1:19:37] woman's seed
[1:19:39] and he goes up there and he know the
[1:19:40] story. He goes to kill the son and the
[1:19:42] and the thunders broke.
[1:19:45] The thunders he heard the voice of God.
[1:19:47] Abraham, Abraham, don't hurt your son. I
[1:19:50] know that you love me now. You are
[1:19:52] blessed.
[1:19:53] And he found out that Abraham will obey
[1:19:55] every word of God. He was blessed.
[1:19:57] Right. Right.
[1:19:59] You don't need nobody send you a
[1:20:00] handkerchief.
[1:20:02] Right.
[1:20:02] Send me a handkerchief and you're going
[1:20:04] to get $15,000 tomorrow.
[1:20:07] Lord have mercy.
[1:20:09] People's dumb enough to believe that.
[1:20:12] Hallelujah. I got $15,000. Oh, wait till
[1:20:15] my wait till my boat come in. Hope it
[1:20:17] come in before tribulation.
[1:20:21] You pay your tithe and offer God to
[1:20:23] bless you.
[1:20:24] We don't need no quack preachers to tell
[1:20:26] God going to bless us. and we in another
[1:20:28] way. But here Abraham was,
[1:20:31] I looked at the scripture. What if
[1:20:33] Abraham would have decided when he got
[1:20:36] to the mountain, I can't do this, Lord,
[1:20:40] this is too much.
[1:20:42] And I believe all the years, God, but
[1:20:43] I'm telling right here at the end of
[1:20:45] this mountain, I refuse to kill my son.
[1:20:48] What would happen?
[1:20:49] Right?
[1:20:49] I'm going to tell you what would happen
[1:20:51] if Abraham would not have offered as it.
[1:20:53] There would not been a scripture read
[1:20:55] that people preach on every day or
[1:20:57] everywhere you go. St. John 3:16. God so
[1:21:00] loved the world that he gave his only
[1:21:02] begotten son. Abraham was expressing
[1:21:04] that scripture. God was writing his own
[1:21:06] Bible.
[1:21:07] Amen.
[1:21:08] He had to go. He could not back out
[1:21:10] because God was writing his Bible.
[1:21:13] In other words, that's all these prophet
[1:21:15] was doing. They was writing the word.
[1:21:17] Hallelujah. Give me a few more minutes.
[1:21:19] Hallelujah. It goes it says here then we
[1:21:22] find Deuteronomy how Moses raised up
[1:21:24] Moses your Lord thy God shall raise up a
[1:21:26] prophet like unto me.
[1:21:27] Amen.
[1:21:28] Moses was not a was a not an angel. He
[1:21:32] was a man.
[1:21:32] Right.
[1:21:33] Right. Right.
[1:21:34] And if we going to be like Moses got to
[1:21:35] be a man.
[1:21:36] Hallelujah. That word show you. We
[1:21:37] realize here. But the woman's seed.
[1:21:41] Let do this. Look at him real quick. The
[1:21:43] seed is what God concerned about.
[1:21:45] Right. Right. You said, "Brother Joel,
[1:21:47] see because every seed that God put in
[1:21:50] the earth, he knew which one." He knew
[1:21:53] what was in the seed
[1:21:54] so he could make a law in the word.
[1:21:56] Every seed will bring forth after his
[1:21:59] kind.
[1:22:00] So God planted a seed in your heart and
[1:22:03] clothed it around the earth. When the
[1:22:05] earth is quickened,
[1:22:07] God sees going to come up.
[1:22:08] Because God know his own attributes of
[1:22:10] the seeds.
[1:22:10] Amen.
[1:22:11] Hallelujah. So it doesn't worry you say
[1:22:12] well brother Jewel it don't worry if God
[1:22:14] what if I ain't got a seed then you'll
[1:22:16] be just like Solomon Gamar
[1:22:17] right
[1:22:18] he said if he would not have left us a
[1:22:20] seed we all would have been in the same
[1:22:22] shape the world in today
[1:22:24] the reason you not in that shape is by a
[1:22:27] seed
[1:22:27] right
[1:22:28] hallelujah God left your seed the word
[1:22:31] hal we going to look here now let us
[1:22:33] take this so he go here you remember he
[1:22:36] had to have these things that take place
[1:22:38] because now he's prophesy if you notice
[1:22:41] Do you realize here
[1:22:43] when he made the tabernacle in the
[1:22:45] wilderness?
[1:22:46] You remember he built the tabernacle, he
[1:22:48] put all these these symbols and
[1:22:50] everything here.
[1:22:52] These things were put in a divine order,
[1:22:55] right?
[1:22:56] After the they saw it in heaven,
[1:22:57] right?
[1:22:58] It had to be everything had to be laid
[1:22:59] out,
[1:22:59] right?
[1:23:00] And that priest, he went in that he put
[1:23:03] them bells and he put his robe on. He
[1:23:05] washed whatever he had to do. And when
[1:23:06] he got ready to go behind the veil,
[1:23:08] those bells was ringing. Holy, holy,
[1:23:11] holy unto the Lord. Holy, holy. What if
[1:23:13] them bells quit ringing?
[1:23:16] They drugg him out.
[1:23:18] Something was hid that he didn't make
[1:23:20] right.
[1:23:21] In other words, if one of those vessels,
[1:23:23] if those preachers did not put one of
[1:23:25] those vessel, maybe that vessel would
[1:23:26] have been right here for been in a
[1:23:28] certain way and that priest set it over
[1:23:30] here. If he put it out of order soon as
[1:23:32] he walked in, he would have dropped
[1:23:34] dead.
[1:23:34] Why? Because that temple or that veil,
[1:23:37] that tabernacle in the weather, it was a
[1:23:39] type of the body of Christ that could
[1:23:41] not be one bone broken.
[1:23:42] It had to be everything in order.
[1:23:45] Everything had to be in divine order.
[1:23:47] Glory.
[1:23:51] So here it is. So David sang David sang
[1:23:55] a song and he gets into inspiration
[1:23:58] cuz now he's sang with a song probably
[1:24:01] didn't even make sense at the time he
[1:24:02] sung it. Yeah.
[1:24:04] Probably people say, "What do you mean
[1:24:06] my bones stirred me?"
[1:24:07] Yeah.
[1:24:08] What was he doing? He was prophesying.
[1:24:10] That God had skin on it.
[1:24:13] My bones stirred me.
[1:24:14] Hallelujah. Oh, God. He was singing the
[1:24:16] song and what was he doing? He was
[1:24:18] singing that God was in a motor. God had
[1:24:20] skin on it.
[1:24:21] When Thomas saw him,
[1:24:23] they presumed it was a spirit.
[1:24:25] Right.
[1:24:26] They thought it was a spirit.
[1:24:28] Thomas, put your hand in my side.
[1:24:31] Right. Does a spirit have flesh and
[1:24:32] bone?
[1:24:33] He was testifying that song that David
[1:24:35] had sung. I am standing here with skin
[1:24:38] on me. Hallelujah. So God put skin on
[1:24:40] himself. Hallelujah. That was then we
[1:24:42] find here. Then we find here now all
[1:24:44] these types were bringing God to the
[1:24:46] earth.
[1:24:46] Yep.
[1:24:47] But we had to have anywhere he could
[1:24:49] have when he come to the earth when we
[1:24:51] saw him in the mind of God. He our lamb
[1:24:53] was slain.
[1:24:54] Yeah.
[1:24:55] When God used the word lamb
[1:24:58] that mean it got skin on it. That's
[1:25:00] right. That's right.
[1:25:01] And when you use the word lamb,
[1:25:03] it's got skin on it.
[1:25:05] Cuz when he used the word for the Holy
[1:25:07] Ghost, it's a dull.
[1:25:09] It types the spirit.
[1:25:11] But when he used lamb, it speaks of
[1:25:12] incarnated God.
[1:25:14] So here he was. He's standing here. He
[1:25:16] needed a type because now he needed to
[1:25:18] be kin folks of the human race.
[1:25:20] He needed to he need to be kinful. He
[1:25:22] need to have he need to be he had to
[1:25:24] have flesh and blood like me and you.
[1:25:25] Hallelujah. He had to be able to feel
[1:25:27] what sin was. He had to be able to feel
[1:25:28] what evil thoughts were. He had to be
[1:25:30] able to feel the things.
[1:25:33] How could he feel it except God put skin
[1:25:35] on himself?
[1:25:36] So, but he had to have a type,
[1:25:38] right?
[1:25:39] So, you have a have a legal interest,
[1:25:42] right?
[1:25:43] So, it was number one man to bring a
[1:25:44] legal interest to God.
[1:25:46] It was one man in the Bible he used to
[1:25:48] fulfill a legal interest for God to
[1:25:51] come.
[1:25:52] And you say, "What that man?" Boaz. How
[1:25:54] you Boaz was a man
[1:25:56] that he come and he was just playing God
[1:25:58] and Boaz, you know the story how how
[1:26:00] Naomi and Ruth, they was up there, how
[1:26:02] the judgment hit him and it drove him
[1:26:04] back. But there was a new kinsman,
[1:26:07] right?
[1:26:07] That was just a powerful boys,
[1:26:09] right?
[1:26:11] Yeah.
[1:26:11] He had the law,
[1:26:12] right?
[1:26:13] He was a law man.
[1:26:15] But we need a man of grace.
[1:26:17] Hallelujah. Because he had some problems
[1:26:19] there. We need the grace. We didn't need
[1:26:21] the law.
[1:26:22] But he had the power. Yes.
[1:26:24] That he could have redeemed Nomi and
[1:26:26] Ruth.
[1:26:27] Right.
[1:26:27] But what it did is because
[1:26:29] Ruth was a moronite.
[1:26:31] He refused to redeem her.
[1:26:33] Exactly. Right.
[1:26:34] But boy, I do it.
[1:26:36] I redeem her.
[1:26:38] The type of Boaz.
[1:26:40] I don't care what kindred, tongue, and
[1:26:41] nation. I will redeem them.
[1:26:44] Just like that. What would he do when he
[1:26:46] went down to the woman at the well? It
[1:26:47] was Boaz. Right.
[1:26:49] This woman right here was not going to
[1:26:51] be accepted
[1:26:52] under the Jewish religion.
[1:26:54] She was a she was a half Jew and a half
[1:26:57] Samaritan for they understand she was
[1:26:59] just a dog.
[1:27:01] That's right.
[1:27:02] They was not going to redeem her.
[1:27:03] N
[1:27:04] but Boaz came.
[1:27:06] Woman go get you.
[1:27:08] Hallelujah. I have no other. Hallelujah.
[1:27:10] You have five you got. When I perceive
[1:27:12] that the Messiah come he's on him. What?
[1:27:14] He redeemed her.
[1:27:16] Hallelujah. We need other boys.
[1:27:18] Amen.
[1:27:21] So he had to be he had to be that type.
[1:27:23] Why? You know, because there had to be a
[1:27:25] kingdom redeemer.
[1:27:26] That why John was preaching Revelation
[1:27:28] five.
[1:27:28] He saw a lamb.
[1:27:29] Amen.
[1:27:30] A lamb.
[1:27:31] Boy, was bringing that type to pass.
[1:27:33] He saw a lamb stepped out of eternity.
[1:27:37] Took the book.
[1:27:38] The prophet say he was bleeding. A
[1:27:40] spirit don't bleed.
[1:27:42] A spirit don't bleed.
[1:27:44] But when he come out eternity, he was
[1:27:46] already bleeding. The word was already
[1:27:48] bleeding for you.
[1:27:49] Hallelujah. Every time you accept the
[1:27:51] word, you are covered by the blood.
[1:27:55] G.
[1:27:55] I'm getting ready to parachute now.
[1:27:58] Hallelujah.
[1:28:00] In Revelation 5, weep not John.
[1:28:04] John was weeping.
[1:28:05] Yes, sir.
[1:28:06] Because the law required a kinsman,
[1:28:08] right?
[1:28:09] And he recognized,
[1:28:10] amen,
[1:28:10] there got to be a boy
[1:28:12] after the order of that. Amen. So the
[1:28:15] angel in said, "John,
[1:28:17] look in heaven.
[1:28:19] Look in heaven.
[1:28:21] Find me a man
[1:28:22] that's worthy to take the book,
[1:28:24] right?
[1:28:24] And to claim the bride."
[1:28:27] Where did they take the book and claim
[1:28:28] you and I?
[1:28:29] Hallelujah. John say he looked in the
[1:28:33] heavens,
[1:28:33] right?
[1:28:35] Some good men went up there.
[1:28:36] But they was not good enough.
[1:28:39] John looked underneath the earth.
[1:28:40] Uh-huh.
[1:28:41] Good men was in the earth,
[1:28:43] but they couldn't do it.
[1:28:44] Exactly.
[1:28:45] Because they all was born like me and
[1:28:46] you.
[1:28:47] Hallelu. They was all born like I was.
[1:28:50] Hallelujah. John was weeping because he
[1:28:51] realized this is it. Hallelujah. Ain't
[1:28:54] no man good enough to do it. You said
[1:28:55] what? What you trying to say? What that
[1:28:57] leave brother Brandon? He was there too.
[1:28:59] But he was not worthy to take the book.
[1:29:01] Exactly.
[1:29:02] But he said we've not done John.
[1:29:04] Hallelujah. This is not a man. But the
[1:29:06] line of the tribe of Judah has
[1:29:09] prevailed. He said when he turned the
[1:29:11] Lord, God was stepping out eternity. He
[1:29:13] had skin on it.
[1:29:15] The word became flesh.
[1:29:17] Fulfilling St. John 1:14.
[1:29:20] Glory.
[1:29:22] Hallelujah.
[1:29:24] Oh, praise God.
[1:29:26] And you know why we needed this kinsman?
[1:29:30] We needed this redeemer. Because without
[1:29:33] him, there were some promises that was
[1:29:36] made
[1:29:37] that the Levitical priesthood could not
[1:29:40] accept.
[1:29:42] And I'm going to deal with that for a
[1:29:43] few minutes.
[1:29:44] There was some things that were promised
[1:29:46] was made
[1:29:47] that the Levitical priesthood could not
[1:29:49] redeem.
[1:29:50] Amen.
[1:29:51] And one of them was when Gentile
[1:29:54] wanted this war. Gentile had made a
[1:29:57] covenant with Israel. If I fight, I can
[1:29:59] have an inheritance. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:30:01] You said what the problem was? Gentile
[1:30:03] were born by a prostitute.
[1:30:05] He was an illegitimate basket son.
[1:30:08] You think Israel, the law, we're going
[1:30:11] to let Gentile come in and be saved.
[1:30:13] That's out of it.
[1:30:15] But the the covenant was made.
[1:30:20] I gentlemen,
[1:30:21] right?
[1:30:22] That what they told me when I first come
[1:30:23] to the message.
[1:30:25] I don't even think you going to be
[1:30:26] saved.
[1:30:27] Well, I didn't tell me that. But when I
[1:30:29] got in that old minister meeting, they
[1:30:30] got through whooping me up. I was about
[1:30:31] ready to quit.
[1:30:33] Wy wy w.
[1:30:36] I mean, I went in like this and come out
[1:30:38] like this.
[1:30:40] Cuz I was way put this thing. I don't
[1:30:42] even see how gentleman child could even
[1:30:45] be saved.
[1:30:47] I didn't want to tell them I was in that
[1:30:48] shape.
[1:30:50] I didn't want to tell him I didn't know
[1:30:51] this. My mama did me the same way the
[1:30:53] gentile did. I I didn't want to get up
[1:30:55] and say I'm that man. I just stayed
[1:30:58] quiet
[1:30:58] and I took a beating too.
[1:31:00] But Hallelujah.
[1:31:02] I thank God for grace.
[1:31:04] Hallelujah.
[1:31:05] [Applause]
[1:31:09] So you know what he needed? We needed a
[1:31:10] boy.
[1:31:12] We I needed somebody. Hallelujah. I
[1:31:14] needed somebody that would not use the
[1:31:17] Levitical order.
[1:31:18] That why the book of Hebrews, he raised
[1:31:20] up on a candidate order.
[1:31:23] He raised up a new order.
[1:31:24] All right. So you can save Jeff.
[1:31:27] In the heroes of faith, you find Jeff in
[1:31:29] the book of Hebrews 11.
[1:31:32] He made it.
[1:31:33] He didn't make it under Levitical law.
[1:31:34] He made it under the priesthood of the
[1:31:36] masses priesthood. Hallelujah. God
[1:31:38] raising up a massel priesthood because
[1:31:40] we all desire to go to hell. We all was
[1:31:42] in this way. We all come to the world.
[1:31:44] We was all messed up. But God raised up
[1:31:46] a meadel priesthood.
[1:31:48] Hallelujah. We can come in not by works
[1:31:50] but by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:31:52] Thank you, Lord. Bye, buddy.
[1:31:55] Hallelujah.
[1:31:56] Hallelujah.
[1:31:58] Y
[1:32:00] my helicopter running out of gas.
[1:32:04] Amen.
[1:32:04] One more hour.
[1:32:05] Oh no. Praise God. But here we are.
[1:32:09] Everything that God knew was putting God
[1:32:12] in skin.
[1:32:13] That's right. Yeah.
[1:32:14] The virgin birth put him in skin.
[1:32:16] Right. Amen.
[1:32:17] Hallelu. That's all it was. God was
[1:32:18] coming in his skin. Now he was taken
[1:32:19] from Genesis 1. That prophecy of the
[1:32:22] woman seed now became the virgin birth.
[1:32:25] Hallelujah. It was what was he doing? He
[1:32:27] It here go that prophecy way back in
[1:32:29] Genesis. The woman seed became the
[1:32:31] virgin birth.
[1:32:32] Right.
[1:32:32] It produced the woman seed.
[1:32:34] Right. Amen. Exactly. Right.
[1:32:36] It had to be a lamb.
[1:32:37] Amen.
[1:32:38] See, you know, sometime we think God was
[1:32:40] Mary was done wrong and it looked like
[1:32:43] she was done wrong. But how could we
[1:32:45] quote the scripture everything work
[1:32:46] together for the good
[1:32:48] to them that love God,
[1:32:49] right? are called according to his
[1:32:51] purpose and we don't see his purpose. It
[1:32:52] looked like Mary was done wrong. It
[1:32:55] looked like God didn't watch over Mary.
[1:32:57] It didn't like God didn't watch over
[1:32:58] Joseph because by the time she got ready
[1:32:59] to have this baby
[1:33:01] Yeah.
[1:33:01] All these hard necked stiff people
[1:33:04] probably they heard that Mary was
[1:33:05] pregnant anyway.
[1:33:07] For some reason they didn't let him have
[1:33:09] no room.
[1:33:09] That's right.
[1:33:10] You know how people feel today,
[1:33:12] especially in this legalist around the
[1:33:13] message. She ain't coming to my house.
[1:33:15] Yeah.
[1:33:16] But you know a man, a real gentleman.
[1:33:18] All right.
[1:33:19] And even tonight, if you somewhere a
[1:33:21] pregnant lady come to your house,
[1:33:23] she knock on your door. She says, "Sir,
[1:33:24] I need help. I'm about ready to have
[1:33:26] going to I might deliver a baby, but I'm
[1:33:29] calling somebody."
[1:33:31] I'm going to say, "You come on here and
[1:33:32] sit down and make yourself at home until
[1:33:34] I get in here and find use some help."
[1:33:36] I mean, that's just the way a man that's
[1:33:37] way a good gentleman would think.
[1:33:40] But the Bible said
[1:33:42] there was no room for them.
[1:33:44] That's right. In the end,
[1:33:47] Paul, Mary, and Joseph
[1:33:49] walking away rejected. Hallelujah.
[1:33:52] Rejected. Curing a child of God in her
[1:33:55] womb. Here she's rejected by these hard
[1:33:57] stiff neck people. Probably heard all
[1:33:59] kind of heresies against her and
[1:34:00] everything. I don't want that
[1:34:02] illegitimate child born in my house.
[1:34:04] Hallelu. You know, cuz they were saying
[1:34:06] that Mary got pregnant by Roman soldier
[1:34:08] that history says.
[1:34:09] So here they were. They probably had and
[1:34:11] they rejected Mary. But I want to let
[1:34:14] you know they was not rejecting Mary.
[1:34:16] God was fulfilling the scripture. Mary
[1:34:18] had to go to a stable in order for
[1:34:20] Christ to be a lamb. He had to be born
[1:34:22] there.
[1:34:25] Hallelujah. Lamb ain't born in a motel.
[1:34:27] A born in a house.
[1:34:28] He's born in a stable in a manual.
[1:34:31] Hallelujah. It was him. God was
[1:34:32] fulfilling. He was he was leading her
[1:34:34] all the time. Even though our human life
[1:34:37] could not cover her in, but it was his
[1:34:38] purpose.
[1:34:39] Exactly. Right.
[1:34:40] Right. Yes, sir. Like I said, John the
[1:34:42] Baptist had to be a He could not have
[1:34:44] been a priest.
[1:34:45] John the Baptist should have been a
[1:34:47] priest.
[1:34:48] He should have went down the same
[1:34:50] lineage that his father went down.
[1:34:52] His father Zachariah was a priest.
[1:34:54] He should have been able to look back to
[1:34:56] his great-grandfather and his
[1:34:58] great-grandfather all the way back to
[1:34:59] Abraham. They said, "Abraham, our
[1:35:01] father, you know, they knew who it was.
[1:35:04] They knew that lineage right there. They
[1:35:06] knew my grandfather, this grandfather,
[1:35:07] and this grandfather and this
[1:35:08] grandfather was
[1:35:10] I probably can't make it to past my
[1:35:12] first one.
[1:35:14] But the preacher could prove by the
[1:35:16] genealogy who they are,
[1:35:18] right?
[1:35:18] The Bible say except the righteous
[1:35:20] exceed the righteous of a Pharisee, it's
[1:35:22] impossible,
[1:35:23] right?
[1:35:23] Cuz everything is laid out in the
[1:35:25] natural
[1:35:26] is in order,
[1:35:27] right?
[1:35:28] But God ain't looking at the the the the
[1:35:30] seed of the flesh, Abraham.
[1:35:32] He was looking at the prophecy of
[1:35:33] Abraham. Yes sir.
[1:35:34] If you go find read the book of Galia
[1:35:36] Galatians he was not talking about the
[1:35:39] seed and the seed singularly.
[1:35:41] Hallelujah. In other words, so here so
[1:35:43] here here it was. Here go the prophecy
[1:35:46] was about the seed
[1:35:48] it going to come in the flesh. It was
[1:35:50] made in flesh.
[1:35:51] So now John the Baptist being a he
[1:35:54] should have been a priest.
[1:35:56] But when God purposes working something
[1:35:57] out
[1:35:58] God ain't looking at well what happened.
[1:36:00] God looking at a purpose.
[1:36:02] And John the Baptist cannot be a priest.
[1:36:05] So order for John the Baptist not be a
[1:36:06] priest, let me be mean, they had to
[1:36:08] raise up and kill Zachariah. And when
[1:36:09] they killed Zachariah, John run to the
[1:36:12] wilderness so he could be trained to be
[1:36:14] a prophet, not a priest.
[1:36:16] So when he come out of the wilderness,
[1:36:17] he had thus said the Lord. I am the one
[1:36:20] cried in the wilderness.
[1:36:22] It would prophecy. He made clear by your
[1:36:23] hands.
[1:36:24] So he goes in here,
[1:36:25] right? I'm getting ready to use this
[1:36:27] last few comment about clothes now cuz
[1:36:30] I'm in overdrive. I don't want to crash
[1:36:33] my plane, my helicopter.
[1:36:37] But anybody got you ain't landing a
[1:36:39] helicopter like you can a plane. When it
[1:36:42] run out of fuel, you might as well say
[1:36:43] to the L.
[1:36:46] But here we are. So here he was. It was
[1:36:49] time for all the proposition to make
[1:36:51] everything was fulfilled.
[1:36:53] Christ was the very
[1:36:57] fulfillment of all the prophecies
[1:36:59] of the Old Testament.
[1:37:01] He was the very So now he had to go you
[1:37:04] why I say we forget about what the cross
[1:37:06] did.
[1:37:06] Right.
[1:37:07] All right.
[1:37:07] Not that we preach the message but we
[1:37:09] forget about the cross.
[1:37:10] Right.
[1:37:10] The message is the cross. Right. Right.
[1:37:12] Paul said, "I claim to know nothing
[1:37:14] among you but Jesus Christ
[1:37:17] and him crucified."
[1:37:19] Because outside of him going to the
[1:37:20] cross
[1:37:22] and dying, it would be impossible for us
[1:37:24] to become sons of God.
[1:37:26] But once he died, he sent back the
[1:37:29] anointing to quicken that word that was
[1:37:31] in you.
[1:37:32] It took the sunlight,
[1:37:34] the rising of the sun to make it come
[1:37:36] out.
[1:37:38] Let me say this here.
[1:37:40] But God had some He had a had a guy on
[1:37:44] the cross. You know the story
[1:37:46] said, "Remember me when you come into
[1:37:47] your kingdom."
[1:37:49] Hallel
[1:37:52] to say that I fit that part, too. But
[1:37:53] here we are.
[1:37:55] Right.
[1:37:56] We're no good for nothing.
[1:37:57] And you said, "Well, brother, I went
[1:37:59] that way." Hey, I'm going to tell you
[1:38:00] what. I don't We looking at natural
[1:38:02] genealogy.
[1:38:03] I'm talking about the spiritual
[1:38:04] genealogy now. The natural I was going
[1:38:06] Tell you what, it was not it was not
[1:38:08] nothing in the natural I done.
[1:38:10] Hallelujah. But it's by his grace.
[1:38:12] It's by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:38:14] He looked through the here go this old
[1:38:15] here go this thief
[1:38:18] that was recognized Jesus was still in
[1:38:20] the Old Testament.
[1:38:23] Amen. Y'all ever thought about that?
[1:38:24] This thief on the cross was still in the
[1:38:26] Old Testament.
[1:38:27] Hallelujah. He where the Holy Ghost
[1:38:28] wasn't even given yet.
[1:38:30] So here he was still trapped in the Old
[1:38:32] Testament. But he bleed a lamb. Look on
[1:38:34] that lamb on the cross. Hallelujah. He
[1:38:37] took the brazen serpent
[1:38:39] and he looked cuz he was bit by death
[1:38:41] and he was getting ready to die and he
[1:38:43] says to him
[1:38:44] that's good
[1:38:45] remember me
[1:38:47] he recognized
[1:38:48] glory
[1:38:49] him on the cross
[1:38:51] and look on that remember in the
[1:38:52] wilderness they looked at that servant
[1:38:54] they live how he looked to Christ
[1:38:56] all the sins of the world was on him
[1:38:59] that brass servant was taken to judgment
[1:39:01] and he looks to him
[1:39:03] and he says to him when you come into
[1:39:06] your kingdom.
[1:39:08] Remember me.
[1:39:09] Amen.
[1:39:10] Jesus turns around and says,
[1:39:12] "This day
[1:39:15] this day
[1:39:17] you will be with me
[1:39:19] in paradise."
[1:39:21] He did not redeem him because of good
[1:39:24] works.
[1:39:25] He redeemed him because he had faith in
[1:39:27] atonement.
[1:39:28] Hallelujah.
[1:39:28] That was shed for him.
[1:39:30] He didn't redeem him because he went to
[1:39:31] church and was a good boy. He redeemed
[1:39:34] him because he recognized the blood.
[1:39:36] And the prophet said when Christ looked
[1:39:38] through his own blood,
[1:39:40] right?
[1:39:41] Red through red.
[1:39:43] And the blood run across his eyes, he
[1:39:45] saw it white as snow.
[1:39:46] He said, "This day you'll be with me."
[1:39:49] Cuz he had to be perfect to get there.
[1:39:51] And only thing that can make it perfect
[1:39:53] is God looked through his own blood.
[1:39:55] Amen.
[1:39:56] Now then he This is it. My last brief
[1:39:59] comments.
[1:40:01] This ain't normal.
[1:40:03] Hallelujah.
[1:40:04] But here we are. Last few comments. He
[1:40:08] went down. He conquered everything he
[1:40:09] said he going to do.
[1:40:11] He come up with the keys of death and
[1:40:12] hell.
[1:40:14] Keys.
[1:40:15] Everything that you got in your life. He
[1:40:16] said, "I got the power to unlock it."
[1:40:18] Hallelujah. If you fighting depression,
[1:40:19] he said, "I can lock und everything,
[1:40:22] every power you got, I got the key. I
[1:40:25] can unlock it."
[1:40:26] Hallelujah.
[1:40:28] God got the keys to do it.
[1:40:29] Amen.
[1:40:30] So what did he come up? He unlocked
[1:40:31] every day. Now he steps out on the road
[1:40:33] demos.

[1:40:42] he goes down to the he goes down to
[1:40:45] Emmas.
[1:40:46] And when he get down to Emmas, if you
[1:40:49] know the story here, here go two men.
[1:40:52] Couple of his disciples walking down the
[1:40:54] road
[1:40:55] trapped in the Old Testament.
[1:40:57] Wowy wy woo.

[1:41:09] Oh, God. Man, they done my Jesus so
[1:41:12] wrong. Oh, God. Look at But all they
[1:41:15] could remember
[1:41:17] is the Old Testament.
[1:41:18] That's right.
[1:41:19] The Old Testament is all they had in
[1:41:21] their mind

[1:42:11] Okay. Let pray. Step beside this young
[1:42:12] man.
[1:42:16] All right. I want you to notice what
[1:42:17] they were looking at.
[1:42:19] Here they was going from the road to
[1:42:20] Emmas. Yes, sir.
[1:42:22] They were still in the Old Testament.
[1:42:24] That's what they remember this old
[1:42:25] Jesus.
[1:42:27] Oh, how he looks so tied and he was so
[1:42:29] wore out.
[1:42:32] This old Jesus.
[1:42:36] And you know they just hold it. If you
[1:42:38] had a body to come back to earth in
[1:42:40] God gave you the choice to come back to
[1:42:42] an earth.
[1:42:43] Which one of them bodies you think you
[1:42:49] I had to come back to the earth. I'm
[1:42:50] going after this one
[1:42:51] cuz I already seen how that one got up.
[1:42:54] Oh no.
[1:42:56] That's right.
[1:42:57] This is what the New Testament Jesus,
[1:43:00] they never saw him in the New Testament.
[1:43:02] They could only go back to the Old
[1:43:04] Testament. He was this way. But in the
[1:43:06] New Testament,
[1:43:07] they cannot recognize the new body.
[1:43:10] God bless you.
[1:43:12] Hallelujah. God bless you.
[1:43:13] That when they did not recognize, they
[1:43:15] had not recognized the opening of the
[1:43:17] word.
[1:43:18] The New Testament brought new bodies.
[1:43:23] Hallelujah. That's right.
[1:43:24] Musicians come back.
[1:43:26] Yes, Lord.
[1:43:28] Come on now, musician. Hallelujah.
[1:43:32] Praise God.
[1:43:33] Amen.
[1:43:34] Amen.
[1:43:36] Man, Praise God.
[1:43:39] And that was that your wife is sitting
[1:43:40] beside you.
[1:43:41] Yes, sir.
[1:43:41] Well, you still look good to her cuz her
[1:43:43] eyes getting dim.
[1:43:46] Yes.
[1:43:50] Praise God. Amen.
[1:43:53] She probably say, "Oh, he's so happy."
[1:44:00] I can't say too much, but I'm going to
[1:44:02] tell you what people, we don't want to
[1:44:05] live under this Old Testament of death,
[1:44:07] right?
[1:44:08] I'm looking under the New Testament.
[1:44:10] I'm looking for the resurrection and
[1:44:11] life,
[1:44:12] a kind of death. And the Old Testament
[1:44:15] may die as a death boy and ghost out.
[1:44:18] But the New Testament
[1:44:19] brought a resurrection of the body
[1:44:22] acquainting power. He's in the same
[1:44:24] spirit that raised Christ from the dead.
[1:44:26] In the New Testament,
[1:44:29] oh boy, we going to come back young
[1:44:30] again.
[1:44:31] I tell you what, that little spot right
[1:44:32] there going to have an afro. Y'all see,
[1:44:36] I've been trying to hide that spot for
[1:44:38] years.
[1:44:40] It
[1:44:40] getting harder and harder to hide it.
[1:44:42] That's right.
[1:44:43] I mean, it ain't nothing funny about,
[1:44:45] you know,
[1:44:46] hallelujah. But one thing about you, I
[1:44:49] wish I could have a young body with the
[1:44:50] wisdom I got now.
[1:44:52] I would have a lot of money.
[1:44:57] I wouldn't been buying stereo systems
[1:45:00] and all the stupid stuff
[1:45:02] that young guys go through.
[1:45:04] Hello. But by God grace, I thank God
[1:45:06] that he brought us to the New Testament.
[1:45:09] That's right. Thank you, Lord. I thank
[1:45:11] him that he brought us to the New
[1:45:12] Testament.
[1:45:14] Amen.
[1:45:17] I'd like to sing that song we open up
[1:45:19] with. Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[1:45:21] Amen.
[1:45:22] Just sing that one more time. Y'all know
[1:45:23] that song real good. Who was the song?
[1:45:26] I ain't know. Well, he'll sing it for
[1:45:28] me. Sra,
[1:45:29] open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[1:45:33] Open the eyes of my heart.
[1:45:35] Open the eyes of my heart.
[1:45:37] Oh, I want
[1:45:41] I want to see you right now. Oh yes. I
[1:45:44] want to see.
[1:45:47] Oh, hallelujah. Do it now, Lord.
[1:45:50] Open the eyes of my heart.
[1:45:53] Oh, open, Lord.
[1:45:55] Open the eyes of my heart.
[1:45:58] Oh, I want to see you right now, Lord.
[1:46:02] Oh, hallelujah. I want to see you, Lord.
[1:46:04] I want to see you. I want to see in the
[1:46:08] New Testament. Lord,
[1:46:10] [Music]
[1:46:14] come on. I'm going to see in the New
[1:46:16] Testament.
[1:46:18] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:46:21] [Music]
[1:46:24] We say holy, holy, glory.
[1:46:29] And we say what? I live.
[1:46:33] Oh yes Lord.
[1:46:35] Shining in the light of your glory.
[1:46:38] Oh hallelujah. Yes, Lord. Oh, your power
[1:46:44] we sing. Holy, holy, holy. Oh yes,
[1:46:49] Jesus.
[1:46:53] Holy, holy, holy. Hallelujah. All I have
[1:46:58] [Music]
[1:47:06] I want to see.
[1:47:10] Let me say this. If somebody hadn't
[1:47:13] really eyes been open to see Jesus,
[1:47:16] if you're still looking for something
[1:47:17] physical to take place,
[1:47:19] the reason the people is looking for
[1:47:21] brother Brandon to come back and open
[1:47:23] the seven seals in a corporal body and
[1:47:26] he going to come back and he going to do
[1:47:27] this, they hadn't even seen the waiting
[1:47:29] of the word.
[1:47:29] That's right.
[1:47:30] Because when Christ is not coming back
[1:47:32] that way to the bride, he's coming back
[1:47:33] in a revelation form
[1:47:35] as he reveals himself and as you receive
[1:47:38] the word, how do you become the word?
[1:47:40] Hallelujah. The word be preach but the
[1:47:42] vessel. Everybody got their mind trapped
[1:47:44] on the vessel.
[1:47:45] If I can find the vessel,
[1:47:48] if I can find the vessel,
[1:47:50] it ain't the vessel. Cuz when the seals
[1:47:52] were broke, it was seven thunders that
[1:47:53] uttered.
[1:47:54] And when the seven thunders uttered, he
[1:47:55] said, "Write them not
[1:47:57] because he did not want to point us to
[1:47:58] the vessel."
[1:48:00] It was not the vessel we've been looking
[1:48:01] for. That's right.
[1:48:02] He said, "But in the day
[1:48:05] of the voice
[1:48:06] of the seventh angel,
[1:48:08] when he shall begin the sound,
[1:48:10] the mysteries of God shall be finished."
[1:48:13] Why? He didn't want us to see the vessel
[1:48:15] because the last move of God was going
[1:48:16] to be in the five ministry.
[1:48:18] Hallelujah. Where the last the final
[1:48:20] voice
[1:48:21] the voice of many waters
[1:48:24] God through the seven churches standing
[1:48:26] now that in the midst of the seven
[1:48:28] churches it going to be God speaking
[1:48:30] through his body now. Glory.
[1:48:31] Hallelujah. You are the voice of God.
[1:48:34] The final voice
[1:48:36] will be in his bride body.
[1:48:38] That why he not point us to a vessel.
[1:48:40] Jesus didn't want us to have competence
[1:48:42] in a vessel.
[1:48:44] When the woman saw him at the well, I
[1:48:46] mean the woman went to the grave to
[1:48:47] anoint him.
[1:48:49] Her eyes was looking into the Old
[1:48:51] Testament.
[1:48:52] She want to go to that grave.
[1:48:55] See that Old Testament body
[1:48:57] and pour oil all over it and anoint him.
[1:49:00] But God said, "Nah, that Old Testament
[1:49:03] done been anointed."
[1:49:04] Hallelujah. It's fulfilled in me now.
[1:49:06] Hallelujah. Show me what here. She was
[1:49:08] looking for that body and all of a
[1:49:09] sudden she began to walk away.
[1:49:11] Hallelujah. But he didn't make himself
[1:49:12] known by the body. He said, "My she
[1:49:15] would hear my voice."
[1:49:16] He s the word
[1:49:18] and called her by name,
[1:49:20] Mary.
[1:49:21] And the seals broke.
[1:49:23] And she knew the vessel.
[1:49:26] But the voice is what brings us back to
[1:49:28] the word. In the day of the voice of the
[1:49:30] seven angels,
[1:49:31] when it shall begin the sound, all the
[1:49:34] mysteries of God shall be fitted. And
[1:49:36] how you going to visit up?
[1:49:38] Mrs. Muhammad Ali did not fight for the
[1:49:41] title.
[1:49:43] No, she didn't.
[1:49:44] She didn't really fight for the title.
[1:49:45] She didn't do nothing.
[1:49:47] All she did when he come in, hand me
[1:49:50] that check, buddy.
[1:49:52] H We didn't fight for this title.
[1:49:54] That's right.
[1:49:54] But when God conquered death, grave in
[1:49:56] hell, he gave us the check. Right.
[1:49:58] All you got to do is cash your bribe.
[1:50:00] The check it in your hand.
[1:50:01] The devil brought ripped them and I
[1:50:04] spoil all principality is in your head.
[1:50:08] But what looking at a check don't get
[1:50:09] you in no money in the bank.
[1:50:12] I got a big check.
[1:50:14] I'm going to put this on the wall.
[1:50:16] If I get a big check, I ain't putting it
[1:50:17] on the wall.
[1:50:19] Wall ain't where you go in the bank.
[1:50:22] If you want something God, you got to
[1:50:23] cash it in. If you need healing, you
[1:50:26] need to cash it in. If you ain't got
[1:50:27] enough faith, you need to cash it in.
[1:50:29] If you need something from God,
[1:50:31] open your eyes as brother Sam come back.
[1:50:34] Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[1:50:36] May God bless you tonight.
[1:50:38] How long I've been a long time.
[1:50:39] Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[1:50:42] Oh yes.
[1:50:43] Open the eyes of my heart.
[1:50:47] I want to see.
[1:50:50] Oh, hallelujah.

[1:53:09] you cuz that was it was wonderful. Now
[1:53:12] we've had a great time. We go down, we

[1:53:17] hunting when we're together. So, we just
[1:53:19] sit around, count, and have a good time

[1:53:56] That's something
[1:54:10] right there.
[1:54:54] I don't know.
[1:55:08] No one knew how alone I was feeling
[1:55:15] and the emptiness I tried so hard to
[1:55:20] hide.
[1:55:22] Though I laughed and said my life was
[1:55:26] fine without you.
[1:55:30] I was covering up the secret tears I
[1:55:35] cried.
[1:55:37] Then one day someone told me of your
[1:55:41] mercy
[1:55:44] and the love you showed on a hill called
[1:55:48] Calvary.
[1:55:51] There you died and purchased my
[1:55:56] redemption.
[1:55:59] When you broke since far and set my
[1:56:02] spirit free,
[1:56:06] I
[1:56:10] love me.
[1:56:13] I
[1:56:17] you
[1:56:20] through your preious
[1:56:22] blood I found
[1:56:27] and my sins are washed where all washed
[1:56:32] away. All my sins are washed away.
[1:56:40] Yes, it's true. There have been days
[1:56:43] when I have failed you,
[1:56:47] Lord. You know the many times I've gone
[1:56:51] astray.
[1:56:54] But I've learned your love is stronger
[1:56:58] than my weakness.
[1:57:01] And your ear is open every time I pray.
[1:57:08] No one else has ever cared for me like
[1:57:13] you, Lord.
[1:57:15] Other friends can never be as close to
[1:57:20] me.
[1:57:22] I'm not afraid to face the problems of
[1:57:26] tomorrow.
[1:57:29] Knowing you are everything I'll ever
[1:57:33] need.

[2:20:19] his eyes saying, "Tell me this isn't
[2:20:24] so."
[2:20:27] There was no one in heaven and no one on
[2:20:32] earth
[2:20:34] worthy to open the scroll.
[2:20:40] But one of the elders said, "John, don't
[2:20:44] you cry. It's all a part of the plan."

[2:24:33] and u it uh but I I'll read her
[2:24:37] testimony and then I'll I'll what she
[2:24:40] wrote um she wrote it in Tagalog which
[2:24:42] is the Filipino language and her oldest
[2:24:45] daughter she translated into English. So
[2:24:48] um here's the here's the testimony says
[2:24:51] this morning I would like to praise and
[2:24:53] thank our Lord Jesus. He is worthy to be
[2:24:56] praised and thanked for his greatness
[2:24:58] and faithfulness to his word.
[2:25:01] He's a God that never changes. He is
[2:25:03] Jesus Christ yesterday, today, and
[2:25:06] forever. How he healed Dan is still how
[2:25:09] he heals now. Praise his holy name.
[2:25:11] Amen.
[2:25:12] Amen.
[2:25:13] On December 5th, 2014,
[2:25:16] I was at the hospital to remove a tumor
[2:25:19] that was found in my bladder. The biopsy
[2:25:22] results showed that it was bladder
[2:25:23] cancer. When I found out about this, I
[2:25:27] wasn't worried because I know that I
[2:25:29] have the Lord who would heal me.
[2:25:31] I had faith in him and because he is the
[2:25:34] great physician, I left it all up to
[2:25:36] him. Let me say, let me say just add
[2:25:38] this in there. She throughout this whole
[2:25:42] time did not seem like she was having
[2:25:44] cancer. She didn't act like it. She
[2:25:46] would uh I tell you it's her she has a
[2:25:50] woman of great faith. Amen.
[2:25:51] She just didn't act like it. She didn't
[2:25:53] even act worried. She just put it all in
[2:25:55] God's hands. Amen.
[2:25:58] She continues here. I had to go for
[2:25:59] chemotherapy for over 4 months and I
[2:26:03] thank the Lord Jesus for giving me the
[2:26:05] strength to overcome this trial that
[2:26:07] came into my life.
[2:26:08] I know that he would not give me a trial
[2:26:11] that I cannot overcome.
[2:26:13] Because of the strong faith I have in
[2:26:15] him, I was able to bear the hardship
[2:26:17] during those chemotherapy treatments.
[2:26:20] The chemo did not affect me negatively
[2:26:23] and he has continued to give me
[2:26:25] strength.
[2:26:27] And if she lost any hair, it was very
[2:26:29] minimal. I mean, as you can see, she
[2:26:31] still has almost all her hair. God
[2:26:33] really kept her throughout the whole
[2:26:35] through all those treatments. Four
[2:26:36] months of chemotherapy.
[2:26:39] Amen.
[2:26:40] The cheers who performed the operation
[2:26:43] and it was successful.
[2:26:45] I praise him with all of my heart and
[2:26:47] soul. I know that he has already healed
[2:26:50] me at the cross of Calvary. He has
[2:26:53] already taken all my sickness and he has
[2:26:55] taken them for his own self. By his
[2:26:58] stripes and wounds, I am healed.
[2:27:01] Praise his holy name. I continue to hold
[2:27:04] on to his word which gives life to all
[2:27:07] that believe in him. I believe that
[2:27:09] whatsoever I ask to the father in the
[2:27:12] name of Jesus will be granted unto me.
[2:27:14] Amen.

[2:29:08] I've just come into a valley.
[2:29:14] One like I've never been before.
[2:29:18] I keep searching for a way out. Seems
[2:29:23] like padlocks are on the door.
[2:29:28] Oh, there must be another sunrise,
[2:29:32] another sunset that I see.
[2:29:37] God will make this trial a blessing.

[2:31:55] valley.

[2:32:01] And it's good to see the sunshine
[2:32:06] and to taste sweet victory.

[2:32:40] There's no need to get discouraged.
[2:32:45] There's no need to talk defeat.
[2:32:50] God will make this trial a blessing.
[2:32:54] And the whole wide world will see
[2:33:14] Glory.
[2:33:24] Let's see. A warrior of faith.
[2:33:26] Take God as his word.
[2:33:29] That's all he wants, isn't it?
[2:33:32] Somebody just take him at his word and
[2:33:35] believe it. Amen.

[2:34:15] [Music]
[2:34:23] As we draw this year to a close, I just
[2:34:28] want to say a little something.
[2:34:30] If you haven't expressed
[2:34:33] your gratitude to brother and sister
[2:34:36] Dale for that awesomeness and you know
[2:34:39] what I'm talking about so we don't have
[2:34:40] to air our laundry on the internet.
[2:34:44] Um it's not too late.
[2:34:46] I know I was highly blessed. I'm just
[2:34:50] saying.
[2:34:52] Which leads us to this song.
[2:34:54] And brother Louise preached on it the
[2:34:56] other week here
[2:34:58] about not taking things for granted and
[2:35:00] living the life
[2:35:02] stature of a perfect man.
[2:35:06] [Music]
[2:35:14] [Applause]
[2:35:27] As the time is drawing near
[2:35:32] that our Lord will soon appear.
[2:35:37] May we check out
[2:35:40] our lives.
[2:35:42] Keep them pure and spotless white.
[2:35:48] Daily striving

[2:35:56] just like they getting rid of the small
[2:36:00] things
[2:36:01] we find. It's those little foxes that's
[2:36:06] fall.
[2:36:08] Lord, we're asking,
[2:36:11] we're praying,
[2:36:13] help us become
[2:36:15] the stature of a perfect man.
[2:36:21] [Music]
[2:36:28] We need faith,
[2:36:31] dear Lord.
[2:36:33] It comes by hearing
[2:36:36] your word.
[2:36:38] Next is virtue,
[2:36:41] strength, and power to give to others in
[2:36:46] this evil hour.
[2:36:48] Knowledge to judge the right from wrong.
[2:36:53] Temperance to handle our temper and
[2:36:57] tongue.
[2:36:58] patience to wait till God's own time.
[2:37:03] Godliness like you, we want to be found.
[2:37:08] Brotherly kindness,
[2:37:11] Lord, help us. Apply it all
[2:37:16] that comes your perfect love.
[2:37:21] [Music]
[2:37:28] Love suffers
[2:37:31] long.
[2:37:33] Love protects when your brother is
[2:37:36] wrong.
[2:37:38] Love's not easily
[2:37:41] provoked.
[2:37:43] When evil about you is spoke.
[2:37:47] Love is patient and love is kind.
[2:37:52] Love reaches out when someone falls.
[2:37:57] Love covers a multitude
[2:38:00] of sin. And love will make us this
[2:38:04] battle win.
[2:38:06] Lord, we're asking,
[2:38:09] we're praying,
[2:38:11] help us become
[2:38:14] that stature of a perfect man.
[2:38:24] Lord, we're asking,

[2:39:05] No. I thought we were going to get
[2:39:07] somebody to help you.
[2:39:23] I didn't plan to sing this one. This is
[2:39:25] at Esther's request.
[2:40:14] I was there when the spirit came.
[2:40:19] Felt his power and I praise his name.
[2:40:23] I was there when the spirit
[2:40:26] came.
[2:40:30] [Music]
[2:40:31] Felt the fire falling from above.
[2:40:35] Oh, the wondrous goodness of his love.
[2:40:39] I was there when the spirit
[2:40:42] came.
[2:40:45] [Music]
[2:40:47] Oh, holy father,
[2:40:50] just let thy goodness rain.
[2:40:55] Feed me Lord Jesus
[2:40:58] in the spirit once again.
[2:41:03] If you've never felt his purpose, then
[2:41:07] you had better go repent again.
[2:41:11] I was there when the spirit
[2:41:14] came.
[2:41:16] [Music]
[2:41:19] Like the day of Pentecost,
[2:41:23] the disciples in the spirit were lost.
[2:41:27] They were there when the spirit
[2:41:30] came.
[2:41:33] [Applause]
[2:41:35] Like a mighty rushing roll of wind,
[2:41:39] souls were saved in Christ the same as
[2:41:41] then.
[2:41:43] I was there when the spirit
[2:41:46] came.
[2:41:51] Oh holy father,
[2:41:54] just let thy goodness rain.
[2:41:59] Feed me, Lord Jesus,
[2:42:02] in the spirit once again.
[2:42:07] If you've never felt his cupers, then
[2:42:11] you had better go repent again.
[2:42:15] I was there when the spirit
[2:42:18] came.
[2:42:20] [Music]
[2:42:24] [Applause]
[2:42:35] We'll we'll sing this one in Swahili,

[2:47:36] Is there something in your heart
[2:47:40] between you and the Lord?
[2:47:44] Are you drifting
[2:47:47] apart?
[2:47:49] Not as close anymore.

[2:49:02] Lay it at the cross and take the hammer
[2:49:06] in your hand.
[2:49:10] Nail it to the cross.

[2:51:00] He's getting it. May I give a little
[2:51:01] testimony for him while he's coming?
[2:51:08] He was out fishing one day and him and
[2:51:10] his brother
[2:51:13] and he had uh boots on and things, you
[2:51:16] know, like working concrete and stuff.
[2:51:19] He fell out of the boat and turned it
[2:51:21] over. That's right.
[2:51:22] Him and his brother. those boots and
[2:51:25] things pulled him down.
[2:51:28] And uh
[2:51:30] the boat was turned over. His brother
[2:51:31] went had to get the boat back up, turn
[2:51:33] it back over and do everything. And
[2:51:36] he'll tell you all he knew was just
[2:51:38] raise his hands and he had the rod and
[2:51:40] reel in his hand. He was that far
[2:51:43] underwater till it just stuck barely.
[2:51:45] The man had to hunt him in the water
[2:51:48] and got a hold of him and pulled him up.
[2:51:50] No telling how long. They don't know for
[2:51:52] sure because he had to get in the boat
[2:51:54] and get it back, ride it up, do
[2:51:55] everything. And him still underwater.
[2:51:59] But God was there.
[2:52:01] He's still God. Come on.

[2:52:46] This old house
[2:52:49] that I'm living in
[2:52:52] is in need
[2:52:54] of repair.
[2:52:58] The windows
[2:53:01] and the shadows
[2:53:04] are letting in the cold air.
[2:53:11] I say
[2:53:14] going to fix them
[2:53:17] when I
[2:53:19] get some time.
[2:53:23] But all I'm getting lately
[2:53:29] is leaving
[2:53:31] on my mind.
[2:53:35] Lately, all I got is a leaping
[2:53:40] on my mind.
[2:53:47] Seems it's what I think about
[2:53:55] most of the time
[2:54:00] soon
[2:54:02] and very soon
[2:54:05] I'll leave my troubles

[2:54:35] place to live. Yes. But lately,
[2:54:41] I can't get excited
[2:54:45] about the world and what it can give.
[2:54:50] You see, I could care less
[2:54:54] if I could buy it all
[2:54:57] for solitary.
[2:55:03] You see, what good would a world do me?
[2:55:09] with leaving
[2:55:11] on my mind.
[2:55:15] Lately, all I got is leaving on my mind.

[2:57:34] that my parents, my family is of course
[2:57:36] not believers, and they think that I've
[2:57:38] been brainwashed. I wish I could be. I
[2:57:40] really do. But, you know, I I talked to
[2:57:43] my mom today. She's down at my sisters
[2:57:45] and she says, "What are you doing?" I
[2:57:47] said, "We're getting ready to go to
[2:57:48] church." "What time you leaving? 5 6:00.
[2:57:51] Won't get home till after 1:00, 2:00 in
[2:57:53] the morning." I said, "Well, yeah, but
[2:57:55] you know, there's no place I'd rather
[2:57:57] be. I mean,
[2:57:59] I come and I work sometimes and I work
[2:58:01] too long and get a bad attitude and I I
[2:58:04] ask you to forgive me for that, but
[2:58:06] there's just nowhere I'd rather be than
[2:58:07] with each one of you guys. Every one of
[2:58:09] you."
[2:58:10] Amen.
[2:58:12] Amen. You can't sing when you crying.

[2:58:29] Not like that.
[2:58:31] Wait till we're finished.
[2:58:37] Some seek for wealth down here. Some
[2:58:40] seek for fame.
[2:58:42] I don't care if no one even knows my
[2:58:46] name. I feel like a stranger here. Soon
[2:58:50] I'll be gone. Nothing can hold me here.
[2:58:55] I'm headed home. Well, nothing can hold
[2:59:00] me here. I'm headed home. Heavenly gates
[2:59:05] are near. It won't be long till I'm
[2:59:08] walking on streets of gold. Singing
[2:59:12] around God's throne. Nothing can hold me
[2:59:15] here. I'm headed home. If I should die
[2:59:20] down here before that trumpet sounds, if
[2:59:24] they lay my body in that cold, cold
[2:59:27] ground, don't need to weep for me. Don't
[2:59:31] sing me no sad song. Heaven can hold me
[2:59:35] here. I'm headed home. Well, nothing can
[2:59:40] hold me here. I'm headed home.
[2:59:44] Heavenly gates are near. It won't be
[2:59:48] long till I'm walking. All streets are
[2:59:51] gold. Singing around God's throne.
[2:59:54] Nothing can hold me here. I'm headed

[3:00:49] [Music]
[3:00:55] I like these old songs. We I know that
[3:00:57] brother Larry and and Sister Jeannie
[3:00:59] remember the naps. They were all good
[3:01:01] friends and we uh I used to enjoy them
[3:01:03] singing this song and and um we're going
[3:01:06] to try to sing it.
[3:01:16] Try.
[3:01:20] [Music]
[3:01:26] A woman one time.

[3:01:34] A woman one time
[3:01:39] tried many positions,
[3:01:44] but rather grew worse in the Bible,
[3:01:47] we're told.
[3:01:51] Till one day she heard
[3:01:55] and came unto Jesus.
[3:01:58] [Music]
[3:02:00] If I could but touch him, I know I'd be
[3:02:03] home.
[3:02:06] If I could but touch
[3:02:11] the h of his garment.
[3:02:15] If I could but
[3:02:20] one part of his road,
[3:02:24] I know I'd be healed.
[3:02:28] My sins are forgiven.
[3:02:33] If I could touch him, I know I'd be
[3:02:37] whole.

[3:02:44] by the wayside begging
[3:02:48] with no one to help him along the way
[3:02:55] till Jesus came by
[3:03:00] and heard his sacry.
[3:03:02] [Music]
[3:03:04] He touched his blind eyes and he healed
[3:03:07] him that day.
[3:03:11] If I could baptize
[3:03:15] the hem of his garment.
[3:03:20] If I could bize
[3:03:24] some part of his own,
[3:03:28] I know I'd be healed.
[3:03:33] My sins are forgiven.
[3:03:37] If I could but touch him, I know I
[3:03:40] behold. Sing it with us like this now.

[3:22:09] mighty and tall. He said, "I've come in
[3:22:13] the name of the Lord. I know that mighty
[3:22:17] man did fall." Yes, he'll deliver me in
[3:22:22] my time of need. like those Hebrew
[3:22:26] children from that fire he freed and he
[3:22:29] fed 5,000 with two fishes and bread. And

[3:30:20] can find anything. Amen.
[3:30:30] He can find anything.
[3:30:33] He can find anything. Brother Al, you
[3:30:35] got one for us.
[3:31:01] I have a testimony I want to share, too.
[3:31:03] I haven't even told him.
[3:31:06] While back in and Rebecca went to
[3:31:08] Memphis,
[3:31:10] they were going to go in our car.
[3:31:13] Put it up to your mouth.
[3:31:14] We had had it in the shop.
[3:31:17] and it had a noise under the hood and
[3:31:19] they did not take it.
[3:31:22] I had looked at the front tires and the
[3:31:24] best I could tell they were fine.
[3:31:27] When Anna got back from Memphis,
[3:31:31] we took the car and it had a pipe that
[3:31:34] was loose and was making a funny racket
[3:31:35] under the hood. We had just had it
[3:31:38] worked on.
[3:31:39] She took it back to the guy and in the
[3:31:41] process of him putting that pipe back,
[3:31:43] he noticed that the tires were
[3:31:45] completely worn out on the inside. If
[3:31:48] they'd headed for Memphis in that in
[3:31:49] that station wagon, those tires would
[3:31:52] have blown.
[3:31:54] You think God's not looking out for you?
[3:31:57] Think again. Get you a microphone. You
[3:32:00] ain't getting out of this.
[3:32:03] We are going to attempt to sing you a
[3:32:06] song that was number one in gospel music
[3:32:11] in 1974.
[3:32:14] How Great.
[3:32:16] How Great Thou Art.
[3:32:18] How Great Thou Art was number one in
[3:32:21] gospel music in 1974.
[3:32:24] I said that was a few years after
[3:32:25] brother Brham, but that's probably how
[3:32:27] it made it up there because it was
[3:32:29] popular with him.
[3:32:32] Okay,

[3:44:48] Okay. Sister Barbara,
[3:44:50] come on.
[3:44:53] Hallelujah.
[3:44:54] Coming.
[3:44:55] Going back to line.
[3:45:22] I have a little testimony to go with
[3:45:24] this song. This is an old song, but when
[3:45:27] my children were little, sometimes
[3:45:29] they'd wake up at night, you know, after
[3:45:32] having a bad dream. And um I would tell
[3:45:35] them, I said, "You know what you do when
[3:45:37] you have a bad dream like that and
[3:45:38] you're afraid?" And they said, "What?"
[3:45:40] And they said, "You sing." And they
[3:45:41] looked at me like I was crazy. You know,
[3:45:44] you sing. I said, "Yeah, you start
[3:45:46] praising the Lord." I said, "The bad
[3:45:48] dreams will go away." So we used to sing
[3:45:50] this victory in Jesus.
[3:45:57] I heard an old old story. How a savior
[3:46:02] came from glory.
[3:46:06] How he gave his life on Calvary.
[3:46:09] Oh yes.
[3:46:10] To save a rich like me.
[3:46:14] I heard about his groaning
[3:46:19] of his precious blood
[3:46:22] atoning
[3:46:24] and I repented
[3:46:27] of my sins and won the victory.
[3:46:33] Oh, victory
[3:46:35] in Jesus
[3:46:38] my savior
[3:46:40] forever.
[3:46:42] He saw me
[3:46:45] and he bought me with his redeeing
[3:46:50] blood.
[3:46:52] He loved me.
[3:46:54] I moved here and all my love is due
[3:47:00] here. He plunged me to victory
[3:47:06] beneath the cleansing flood.
[3:47:11] I heard about his healing
[3:47:16] of his cleansing power revealing
[3:47:21] how he made the lame to walk again.
[3:47:25] And he caused the blind to see.
[3:47:30] And then I cried, "Dear Jesus,
[3:47:35] come and heal my broken
[3:47:38] spirit."
[3:47:40] And somehow Jesus came and brought to me
[3:47:45] the victory.
[3:47:49] Oh, victory
[3:47:51] in Jesus
[3:47:54] my savior
[3:47:56] forever.
[3:47:59] He sought me
[3:48:01] anybody
[3:48:03] with his redeeing
[3:48:06] blood.
[3:48:08] He loved me and I knew him and all my
[3:48:14] love is due to him. He plunged me to
[3:48:21] victory
[3:48:23] beneath the cleansing fire.
[3:48:27] I heard about the manure
[3:48:32] he has built for me in glory.
[3:48:37] I heard about the streets of gold beyond
[3:48:42] the crystal sea
[3:48:47] about the angels
[3:48:49] singing
[3:48:51] and the old redemption
[3:48:54] story.
[3:48:56] And some sweet day I'll sing up there
[3:49:00] the song of victory.
[3:49:04] [Music]
[3:49:06] Victory
[3:49:08] in Jesus
[3:49:10] my savior
[3:49:12] forever.
[3:49:15] He saw me and he bought me with his
[3:49:21] redeeing
[3:49:22] blood.
[3:49:25] of the air. I live here and all my love
[3:49:31] is to you.
[3:49:34] Touch me to victory.
[3:49:38] We need the cleansing.
[3:49:42] [Music]

[3:51:01] heart
[3:51:03] are just power.
[3:51:05] They're not mine at all.
[3:51:09] Jesus only let me use them to brighten
[3:51:15] my life. So remind me

[3:52:04] God's son.
[3:52:07] I'm not worthy
[3:52:09] of the scars in his hand.
[3:52:14] Yet he turns the world to Calvary
[3:52:19] to die and I stand why he loves me.

[3:54:31] minutes. Come on, brother Chris. Brother
[3:54:34] Luis.
[3:54:36] I can't pronounce his last name. That's
[3:54:38] why I called her sister Luis.
[3:54:41] I can't pronounce Urego.
[3:54:44] I get it wrong.
[3:54:45] You roll your Rs.
[3:54:46] I don't have no RS in my reggo.
[3:54:48] Rego.
[3:54:52] God bless you all. Um, I wanted to sing
[3:54:55] a song real quick and uh I don't know if
[3:54:57] you all have heard that song uh called
[3:54:59] uh I can feel his holy spirit is a
[3:55:02] southern gospel song. Brother Aaron, you
[3:55:04] might know it. It's goes in the same
[3:55:06] beat as the song brother Aaron I don't
[3:55:07] know I don't know keys and things like
[3:55:09] that but the first song he sung it kind
[3:55:12] of goes like that.
[3:55:16] So that's that's all I know.
[3:55:20] I'll just start singing. But
[3:55:23] uh just right before I sing this, I just
[3:55:25] wanted to uh let everybody know that um
[3:55:28] today, just 10 minutes right before the
[3:55:31] day ends. Today, me and my wife, we have
[3:55:34] our 10th year anniversary. And uh so
[3:55:39] I um
[3:55:42] I just wanted to thank God for for
[3:55:45] giving me a good wife,
[3:55:47] for giving me a a wife that stood by my
[3:55:49] side even when I've made dumb mistakes.
[3:55:52] And uh every day, yes, she's still
[3:55:56] patient with me as I'm going through
[3:55:59] this growing process and aging process
[3:56:02] and widening process as well.
[3:56:05] So, but I I I just appreciate her and I
[3:56:08] thank the Lord for her and uh y'all just
[3:56:10] pray for us. Amen.
[3:56:12] Uh that the Lord would just give us 10
[3:56:14] 10 more, you know.
[3:56:15] And uh we we were looking at the at what
[3:56:18] the different stages of years of of
[3:56:20] marriage you you've been. And apparently
[3:56:23] 10 is is 10. So I didn't want to give
[3:56:27] her a tinfoil, you know, or anything
[3:56:30] like that as a gift. Although she could
[3:56:32] use it in the kitchen.
[3:56:34] But uh anyways, hopefully we'll be able
[3:56:36] to get to that 50 if Lord if the Lord
[3:56:39] terries at that golden that golden Amen.
[3:56:42] get to the point where brother Dale and
[3:56:44] sister Peggy are at. Amen.
[3:56:46] Amen. Praise God. We're going to try to
[3:56:49] attempt this song. Uh you know, when I
[3:56:51] first came into the message, I I I I
[3:56:53] heard a lot of Southern gospel songs,
[3:56:56] and I'm the type of guy I like to sing
[3:56:58] different types of songs. And uh so a
[3:57:01] Latino singing a southern gospel song
[3:57:04] that doesn't seem right. But I like
[3:57:06] southern gospel music. My wife doesn't
[3:57:08] really care much for it, but
[3:57:11] I like the mckameies and all that, you
[3:57:13] know. So So
[3:57:16] brother brother Dick said I'm a redneck.
[3:57:21] I am from way down south.
[3:57:25] Amen. Let's we we'll try to sing this
[3:57:27] song.
[3:57:29] Jesus said it is expected
[3:57:34] [Music]
[3:57:35] for me to go away.
[3:57:40] But I'll send you another comforter
[3:57:46] to guide you from day to day.
[3:57:51] Though they tear
[3:57:53] at Jerusalem
[3:57:56] for power from on high
[3:58:01] and that spirit
[3:58:04] that they receive within my heart
[3:58:09] abides,
[3:58:11] oh I can feel his holy spirit.
[3:58:16] It's a dwelling deep brea within.
[3:58:21] Well, sometimes it feels so tent
[3:58:26] and sometimes like a mighty rushing
[3:58:29] wind.
[3:58:31] But the spirit
[3:58:33] that there is Jesus
[3:58:36] from dead in the grave.
[3:58:41] He will raise his old body might up and
[3:58:47] take me home someday.
[3:58:51] Well, they laid him in an empty tomb and
[3:58:57] they rolled back a stone on the door.
[3:59:01] They put soldiers
[3:59:04] there to guard it. Oh, they thought
[3:59:07] they'd run away with my Lord.
[3:59:11] But on that third day, the stone was
[3:59:15] roll away. And he came forth from the
[3:59:20] grave.
[3:59:22] And that spirit that raised my Jesus up
[3:59:27] will take me home someday.
[3:59:31] Oh, I can feel it. Holy Spirit
[3:59:37] are really
[3:59:42] sometimes
[3:59:44] feel so
[3:59:47] and sometimes I cannot rushing
[3:59:51] but spirit
[3:59:54] that raised my Jesus up from
[3:59:59] the grave.
[4:00:02] They will raise this. Oh my
[4:00:07] take
[4:00:12] [Applause]
[4:00:18] back a stone at the door.
[4:00:22] They put solders
[4:00:24] there to guard it. Only they got away
[4:00:29] with my Lord.
[4:00:31] But the rain the snow was roll away he
[4:00:37] gave from the grave
[4:00:41] in spirit
[4:00:44] and raised my Jesus
[4:00:47] will take us home.
[4:00:51] All I can feel is his holy spirit
[4:00:59] brea
[4:01:02] sometimes
[4:01:04] feel so gentle
[4:01:07] and sometimes like rushing wind
[4:01:11] but that's his spirit
[4:01:14] that raised my Jesus up from me in the
[4:01:20] grave.
[4:01:22] It will raise this
[4:01:25] mighty uplome.
[4:01:30] It will raise this. It will raise this
[4:01:35] mighty
[4:01:36] uplome.
[4:01:43] [Music]
[4:01:55] [Applause]
[4:02:00] I love good music. I think God does
[4:02:12] [Music]
[4:02:13] Heat. Heat.
[4:02:35] [Music]
[4:02:40] I love my music.
[4:02:43] Music always go,
[4:02:45] [Music]
[4:02:47] but there's always a victory in it.
[4:02:55] [Music]
[4:03:01] Amen. And amen. Amen. And amen.
[4:03:05] Amen.
[4:03:08] You had a good night.
[4:03:11] I enjoyed it. Really enjoyed the
[4:03:13] the ministry.
[4:03:16] I believe it.
[4:03:17] I believe brother Forny believes it.
[4:03:21] So that's, you know, you just pray for
[4:03:23] them. They'll be going back home
[4:03:24] tomorrow and you know, having a good
[4:03:28] time in the Lord as much as we can while
[4:03:30] we're here.
[4:03:31] Amen. we get over there, we'll just be
[4:03:33] getting started here and having it. Then
[4:03:35] we can do a good time in the Lord,
[4:03:37] right?
[4:03:38] Appreciate all of the mu, the singing,
[4:03:40] the the the testimonies,
[4:03:43] everything. To me, it's been a wonderful
[4:03:45] year.
[4:03:46] It's a great time to think about how
[4:03:49] that, you know, you and I are the ones
[4:03:54] that know the truth.
[4:03:56] Amen. Glory. Amen. Yes,
[4:03:57] sir.
[4:03:59] And the truth shall set you free. Amen.
[4:04:02] It's just a
[4:04:03] have to get my glasses.
[4:04:05] It's it's a wonderful thing to be able
[4:04:09] to say
[4:04:12] we have the prophet said the
[4:04:16] perfect interpretation
[4:04:20] and he said with divine vindication.
[4:04:22] Amen.
[4:04:23] Amen.
[4:04:23] That's right. God vindicated the word
[4:04:27] and it's interpreted to us by way of the
[4:04:30] prophet messenger.
[4:04:31] We thank God for that
[4:04:33] because it was ordained for you and I.
[4:04:36] Yes, sir.
[4:04:37] And why can't we believe what we are?
[4:04:40] Amen.
[4:04:41] And what God has done, he's chosen this
[4:04:43] people for last.
[4:04:45] No. We never thought years ago that we'd
[4:04:47] be here
[4:04:48] at this time.
[4:04:50] But yet, that didn't change anything in
[4:04:52] God's word. No.
[4:04:54] Cuz he knew all about it.
[4:04:56] He knew right where we'd be and right
[4:04:58] where we're at.
[4:04:59] He knows exactly how long it's going to
[4:05:01] be, what it's going to be.
[4:05:02] And who's worried
[4:05:04] cuz it ain't up to me anyway.
[4:05:07] Amen. Let's just read our scripture. Go
[4:05:09] right into the communion and just let
[4:05:12] the world out there now have their time
[4:05:15] and we just simply take a little time to
[4:05:19] just sit back and relax a little bit.
[4:05:22] You know, communion is really
[4:05:26] talking, fellowshipping,
[4:05:28] right?
[4:05:29] You know, it's brought down to the
[4:05:31] physical part in what Jesus done because
[4:05:35] it's to show you what it is and why
[4:05:38] we're rejoicing and what it's all about
[4:05:41] the
[4:05:42] but it's really just the communication.
[4:05:44] Amen. Right.
[4:05:45] And why can't we do that? We've seen
[4:05:46] people healed
[4:05:48] by taking communion. Right. Sure.
[4:05:51] Yes, sir.
[4:05:52] You know,
[4:05:53] because it's what your mind is and what
[4:05:55] you're thinking about.
[4:05:57] Amen.
[4:05:58] So, let's just go into this. Lord Jesus,
[4:06:01] we thank you for this day that we've had
[4:06:05] an opportunity.
[4:06:06] Thank you for the message that our
[4:06:08] brother brought unto us. We pray you'd
[4:06:10] give him comfort in his body and
[4:06:13] strength, Lord, and everything. Just
[4:06:14] take care of him. And Father, we thank
[4:06:17] you for all of the singing, the
[4:06:19] testimonies, the worships, the the glory
[4:06:22] that it all be given to you, Lord, and
[4:06:25] to your honor. And Father, we ask you to
[4:06:29] just forgive our sins as we come to this
[4:06:32] part of taking communion. None of us are
[4:06:34] worthy, Lord. We know that and realize
[4:06:36] it. But yet, if we just depend upon you
[4:06:39] to take care of it, then all is made
[4:06:42] well and
[4:06:44] we don't have to worry about it. We
[4:06:46] thank you for knowing the truth and then
[4:06:49] letting that truth set us free. Thank
[4:06:52] you for giving us another year, another
[4:06:55] opportunity, another time that we could
[4:06:58] hear your word and walk in the light of
[4:07:01] your grace and love. We love you. We
[4:07:04] thank you. Father, guide us now as we
[4:07:07] partake of this as you broke for us and
[4:07:10] gave to us
[4:07:12] and showing what it was all about. We
[4:07:14] thank you in Jesus name.
[4:07:21] For I have received of the Lord that
[4:07:23] which also I delivered unto you. But the
[4:07:25] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[4:07:27] was betrayed took bread and when he had
[4:07:30] given thanks, he broke it and said,
[4:07:33] "Take, eat. This is my body which is
[4:07:35] broken for you. This do in remembrance
[4:07:38] of me. After the same manner also he
[4:07:41] took the cup when he had sucked, saying,
[4:07:43] "This cup is the new testament in my
[4:07:45] blood. This do ye as often as you drink
[4:07:48] it in remembrance of me. For as often as
[4:07:52] you eat this bread and drink this cup,
[4:07:54] you do chew the Lord's death till he
[4:07:56] come." That's right.
[4:07:57] Wherefore, whosoever shall eat of eat
[4:07:59] this bread and drink this cup of the
[4:08:02] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[4:08:04] body and blood of the Lord. But let a
[4:08:06] man examine himself, and so let him eat
[4:08:08] of that bread and drink of that cup. For
[4:08:11] he that eateth and drinkkeeth
[4:08:13] unworthily, eateth and drinkkeeth
[4:08:14] damnation to himself, not discerning the
[4:08:17] Lord's body. For this cause many are
[4:08:20] weak and sickly among you, and many
[4:08:21] sleep.
[4:08:23] For if we would judge ourselves, we
[4:08:25] should not be judged. Now, this this
[4:08:28] part of the scripture right here is one
[4:08:29] of my favorites. But when we are judged,
[4:08:34] we do wrong. We're judged for doing
[4:08:36] wrong. Look,
[4:08:40] we're chasened of the Lord. Why? That we
[4:08:44] should not be condemned with the world.
[4:08:47] Amen.
[4:08:47] Wherefore, my brethren, when you come
[4:08:49] together to eat, t one for another, and
[4:08:51] if any man hunger, let him eat at home,
[4:08:54] that you come not together under
[4:08:56] condemnation, and the rest will I set in
[4:08:58] order when I come.
[4:09:01] What a wonderful thing to be able to
[4:09:05] know,
[4:09:06] not argue over what it's this way or
[4:09:08] that way or what it is, but to know
[4:09:12] what the communion is all about.
[4:09:13] Amen. Right, brother?
[4:09:15] We know it's not the the body. We know
[4:09:17] it's not the blood.
[4:09:20] But really in actuality, it is greater
[4:09:24] because body and blood won't do what the
[4:09:28] communion will allow you to enter into a
[4:09:31] place
[4:09:32] to be to where that you know you could
[4:09:34] understand a lot of things. You notice
[4:09:37] even why wasn't that why was it Paul was
[4:09:41] chosen to write this Corinthians? Why is
[4:09:44] it that none of the apostles that were
[4:09:47] with the Lord Jesus
[4:09:49] spoke of the communion?
[4:09:52] The greatest John, the Luke's or
[4:09:54] whatever, they never spoke of the
[4:09:56] communion.
[4:09:58] Paul was chosen because he could take
[4:10:02] the Old Testament
[4:10:04] and he could follow that Old Testament
[4:10:07] through
[4:10:08] and he could go right back to that
[4:10:09] unleaven bread. He could go to all of
[4:10:12] those things.
[4:10:14] And then he could come right down
[4:10:18] to where it's laying in front of us.
[4:10:20] Amen.
[4:10:22] Amen.
[4:10:23] Amen.
[4:10:26] Father, we thank you for this bread
[4:10:27] that's been made for this purpose
[4:10:29] tonight. Lord, we just praise your great
[4:10:32] name. We know this is not your body.
[4:10:35] We know it's not words or letters. It is
[4:10:39] bread that is made in a representation.
[4:10:42] What a representation it is in glory for
[4:10:45] to know that when we get there at the
[4:10:47] marriage supper it won't be
[4:10:51] stakes and things Lord it'll be the
[4:10:54] communion
[4:10:55] we'll really understand being all about
[4:10:57] it
[4:10:58] we ask you to sanctify this bread and
[4:11:01] sanctify the partakers because this
[4:11:03] bread is thy word made manifest and we
[4:11:07] love you and thank you in Jesus
[4:11:19] never take the communion. And I don't
[4:11:22] think about
[4:11:24] those people back there
[4:11:27] as they were getting ready to leave out
[4:11:28] of Egypt.
[4:11:31] They were taking it eating their last
[4:11:33] meal,
[4:11:34] getting ready to go.
[4:11:37] Everything was just right.
[4:11:40] It had to be perfect,
[4:11:43] laid in order.
[4:11:46] Then they'd be able to go out of the
[4:11:48] land.
[4:11:50] You just think about it. They're out
[4:11:51] there now blowing off and hollering and
[4:11:53] screaming. Mhm.
[4:11:55] We're just simply taking a little time
[4:11:57] to be sincere before the Lord and thank
[4:12:00] him for all that he's done for us in
[4:12:05] this past year.
[4:12:07] They're screaming and hollering about
[4:12:10] the devil and his works and rejoicing
[4:12:13] over his equipment and doings. And we're
[4:12:17] just simply
[4:12:19] saying, "Well, thank you, Lord.
[4:12:21] Just let us humbly think about
[4:12:26] these things
[4:12:28] that we would not, you know, just be
[4:12:30] something haphazardly,
[4:12:34] but that everything that would be said
[4:12:36] or done
[4:12:39] be for the glory of the Lord.
[4:12:43] Father, we thank you for this wine. It's
[4:12:44] went through the process. It's an
[4:12:46] example of your blood that was shed for
[4:12:48] each one of us. We just thank you. It's
[4:12:51] aged and as it ages, it gets better and
[4:12:54] better. Just like you, Lord. We ask you
[4:12:57] to sanctify the wine, Lord. The bread as
[4:13:01] we take the bread and then we drink a
[4:13:03] little bit of wine and tomorrow this
[4:13:05] will be blood cells in our body because
[4:13:08] of what we're eating and doing. But
[4:13:10] mainly, Lord, let it be cells within our
[4:13:13] human elements of life to make us raise
[4:13:16] and glorify you. sanctify the wine and
[4:13:20] the partakers in Jesus name.
[4:13:30] Come morning
[4:13:32] I'll walk
[4:13:34] by the river.
[4:13:38] I'll rest near the ever
[4:13:43] dream tree.
[4:13:46] out
[4:13:49] my cross
[4:13:51] through the midnight.
[4:13:55] Come morning, there's glory
[4:14:00] for me.
[4:14:03] Sometimes I'm despised
[4:14:07] and rejected
[4:14:10] and I question,
[4:14:13] "Oh, Father,
[4:14:15] how long
[4:14:18] then I take one more look
[4:14:23] at Mount Calvary,
[4:14:27] and it gives me the strength to go Oh,
[4:14:33] no wonder we can sing it. Come morning,
[4:14:36] some morning between 6:00 and 9, right?
[4:14:40] By the river,
[4:14:43] I'll rest
[4:14:46] the ever
[4:14:48] green tree.
[4:14:52] I'll carry
[4:14:54] my cross
[4:14:56] through the midnight.
[4:15:00] I'm mourning.
[4:15:03] There's glory
[4:15:05] for me.
[4:15:07] You said, "Well, brother D, why do y'all
[4:15:08] sing while you're doing the communion?"
[4:15:12] I thought we were to make Mary in our
[4:15:14] hearts and rejoice about everything,
[4:15:16] no matter what it be or whatever we
[4:15:18] doing. And why can't we be happy about
[4:15:21] it and and rejoice and sing and glory? I
[4:15:26] remember when we were there in Israel
[4:15:27] and they told us that there were certain
[4:15:29] psalms that they sang as they entered
[4:15:34] into coming up the steps coming into the
[4:15:37] outer court you know part of the temple
[4:15:39] and there were certain songs that they
[4:15:41] sang
[4:15:44] why can't we be joyous in our heart and
[4:15:46] re you know and glorify God and sing and
[4:15:49] making melody
[4:15:51] from our lips
[4:15:53] and praising him for all that he's done
[4:15:56] for us. Right.
[4:15:58] Come morning,
[4:16:01] I'll walk
[4:16:03] by the river.
[4:16:07] I'll rest
[4:16:09] the ever green tree.
[4:16:15] I'll carry
[4:16:17] my cross
[4:16:19] through the midnight.
[4:16:23] I'm mourning.
[4:16:25] There's glory
[4:16:28] for me.
[4:16:30] Amen. And amen.
[4:16:35] Make sure everybody's
[4:16:38] got the communion.
[4:16:50] You think there's not too much to
[4:16:51] communion, but
[4:16:54] there a whole there's a whole lot to the
[4:16:56] truth.
[4:16:57] I love the truth. Don't you? Yes, sir.
[4:17:10] Let's all partake together.
[4:17:25] Make sure you tell brother Forny how
[4:17:27] much you appreciate him, Sister Forny,
[4:17:30] coming with him and fellowshipping
[4:17:32] together and and all. And we just pray
[4:17:36] that the Lord would bless and guide each
[4:17:38] one of us and keep us. Now, we're going
[4:17:40] downstairs. We have plenty of food. So,
[4:17:42] you're welcome. Everybody's welcome to
[4:17:44] stay and eat and fellowship together for
[4:17:47] a little while and and all and just have
[4:17:50] a good time. We say to you, not just a
[4:17:54] happy new year.
[4:17:56] I'm looking forward
[4:17:58] to this year
[4:18:01] to this day to this. I look forward to
[4:18:03] every hour. Billy Graham said, he said,
[4:18:07] let's see, maybe now if I misquote it,
[4:18:09] but I know he said, I raise every
[4:18:10] morning looking for him to come.
[4:18:13] It seemed like he might have said, "I go
[4:18:14] to bed looking for him to come." But I
[4:18:16] know he said, "Raise
[4:18:17] every morning looking for him."
[4:18:20] Amen.
[4:18:20] And to see him. Well, if he's that away,
[4:18:22] I think we ought to be happier to do it.
[4:18:25] All right. You're dismissed. Father, be
[4:18:27] with us. Go with us now as we eat a
[4:18:29] natural part of a meal. While the world
[4:18:32] is rejoicing, we don't have to go out
[4:18:34] and be a part of them. We just
[4:18:36] fellowship together and have a good time
[4:18:38] in you. We love you and we thank you in
[4:18:40] Jesus name.
[4:18:42] Amen.
[4:18:43] Now remember, Bible study is the second
[4:18:46] Saturday in January, not the first one
[4:18:51] on this. All right.
