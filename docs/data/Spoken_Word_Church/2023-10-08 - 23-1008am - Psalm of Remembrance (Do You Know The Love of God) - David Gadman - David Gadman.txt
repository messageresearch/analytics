that I didn't have a coat that matched my pants amen but you know so but anyway you know we always take it off or whatever but hey how many loves him this morning amen amen if you have your BBL first John the 4th chapter we want to look at something real try not to hold you too long and amen just try to man they got no clock in here do they yeah right there oh okay there it is 1052 I'll holler at all right holler at me my wife usually goes like this you know that means you know cut it cut it short you know she's standing back there I'll have to ride home with her so but hey amen but we appreciate I know one time you know I said something that preach say said you afraid of your wife or something this been years ago and I said amen it just it just fell out well I didn't think she heard me on the way home she said hey why'd you say that you know so anyway we appreciate the Lord amen appreciate God's people 1 John 4:16 and it says it like this and we have known and believe the love that God hath to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word you may be seated amen I like to take for a little thought this morning amen just a real simple preacher amen a a Psalm of remembrance and for a theme do you know the love of God do you know the love of God now if it'd be all right I want to read that again out the amplifi it says and we know understand recognize are conscious of by observation we've observed it and by experience and believe a here to and put Faith in and rely on the love God cherishes for us God is love and he who dwelleth and continues in God dwells and continues in him amen so do you know the love of God brother s it like this on a a message have faith in God 1954 he said brother sister he said that's what the world needs today it's a more love of God Amen I believe that this morning amen he said that's what the world's hungry for today it's more love of God hey I I you know I say like this and this ain't in my notes but this will be free amen and it just like this I believe you know that we all go through things we all go through situ situations and sometimes we don't know you know what others go through until maybe God allows us to go through something and then we realize that hey every one of us have problems every one of us have have desires every one of us make mistakes every one of us have issues amen and we are to pray for one another and love one another amen I think sometimes God allows us to go through things so we'll know how to feel for one another amen I believe we need more love for one another amen hallelujah I think they was talking that brother white said he's been going through the statue of a perfect man you know I believe had there was one that came to maturity in our day showing us that there was going to be more come the same way is that right amen so I believe we need that love that God has that we need love more love for one another Hallelujah that we can pray for one another Hallelujah I want it so much amen hey I've been told that when the prophet was in in Old Mexico and that blind guy came through the line he said he he said he entered into compassion into love he said he put his shoulders to see if his coat would fit him I believe brother R would have gave him his coat put his foot beside him said he was barefooted to see maybe if his shoes would fit I can give him his shoes what about me and you oh God help us this morning amen oh we need to enter in and feel for one another amen we all got loved ones that are lost amen and the only way they're going to see God it's through me and you amen we had the Bible says we are written Epistles there's that book again read of all men wonder what they read when when they read our lives I hope they read Christ amen he said that's what the world's hungry for today it's more love of God he said if we show a little more love to one another little more love towards God how much better are churches and individuals and how much better we'd be if we just love one another amen if we love one another then we can can love God for God is love if we love one another he said amen then we can love God for God is love amen oh let me talk about for just a little moment about the Christian experience amen amen cuz I believe how cuz it said we we learn these things by observation and by experience amen we have to experience something in order to tell somebody something amen so let's just talk now if you were to ask the so-called Christian and you say well brother d boy you say so-called Christian cuz everybody that says you're a Christian is not a Christian this morning everybody says you're a bride's not bride amen everybody says there a Believer is not a Believer this morning amen so if you'd ask a so-called Christian about his experience of the love of God his answer would raise doubts you may think well I I really don't know if he really loves God or not or or he would show reluctance about his experience in other words he would kind of you would think well I don't know if he's really experienced what he's talking about amen he said his experience of the love of God but he said if you'd ask a real true born again Christian his experience of the love of God just just say in one statement his answer joyfully he would say and I say joyously because you know what Joy amen the love of God is the joy of the Lord is our strength let me say it like this we are to be the most happiest people if you've heard that statement before we are to be the most happiest people in the world but ha happy it know it comes from a word that means ha or happen in other words in order for you to be happy something has to happen brother Wade shakes your hand and you're happy they say they sing your favorite song and you're happy the preacher don't step on your toes and you're happy yeah but joy comes from a different Source all together it comes from the Creator itself amen and if the pastor don't shake your hand if you don't get the raise on the job you still got joy and the joy of the Lord is our strength hallelujah amen so joyy he would say I W say nothing about myself but I will speak in the honor of God and I'm sweetly constrained to affirm that I have known and have believe the love that God have for me I believe he's got love for us amen listen again 1963 standing in the Gap they was talking about predestination and things like that someone said some time ago said well if I believe a thing like that would I ever turn on the steam I'd paint the town red I'd go to Every d Hall I get so drunk and everything because why you're already secured in Christ what difference does it make now listen what he said the prophet I said that shows you haven't got it oh Hallelujah see if the love of God on ever struck your heart in the tenderness of Jesus Christ oh I hope this morning that that's what it to do this morning the love of God has strike our heart in the tenderness of Jesus Christ Hallelujah in the tenderness of Jesus Christ you would be so in love with him the world would be dead as your sin oh that's what I wanted to be this I want to be so in love with him this morning amen another statement I ain't got it written down here but I'll just paraphrase it brother Bram said on unite time and sign oh I love this one he said the church and so as in the church as we call ourselves the church the Bride As we call ourselves the bride and the bridegroom they're so unignited and coming together amen that there there's such a love amongst them that you don't have to beg people to pray you don't have to beg them to worship you don't have to beg them to do what's right they're so in love with him till there's nothing else oh God help us this morning to get it so in love with you this morning that there's nothing else oh my there's nothing else he said the world would be dead is your sin that's how you know you have the Holy Spirit not because you could scream shout we could do all those things speak uh uh tongues or whatever it is but when he be but when sin becomes dead and you're alive in Jesus Christ he said oh of God how rich how pure see still talking about the Christian experience amen see we all we all have trials each and every one of us have trials this morning if we'd go around the room we'd probably say oh I just been going through the greatest battle of my life go around the room and we find out see I said it like this before you're either in a trial or a battle either coming out of a battle or fixing to go into a battle that's right brother amen there's no there's no two three ways around it either in one coming out of one or fixing to go into one right and me and you all have trials what made I think brother uh uh Wade said this last night he said whatever like you talked about brother Ryan what may bother him may not bother me and what bothers me may not bother him and you may think my my that's so pilly Brother David hey that's so that's so childish but hey you just don't understand sometimes amen and and you don't know how people you know there let me just back up this ain't in my notes but hey there was one God one time that come to church where we used to go to church at years ago and and and nobody wanted to sit by him they thought he was kind of strange kind of different and he acted kind of different he acted kind of strange but I'm like Paul Harvey this is the rest of the story what made him act that way he was riding in the back of a pickup trying to hold down a mattress and the wind got up under that mattress and blew it out and him with it he hit his head on the pavement and that's why he acted that way so see and until you know the rest of the story sometimes that makes a whole lot of difference when you when you know the rest of the story amen so hey we sometimes we don't know why is that bothering her why is that bothering him but you might not know the rest of the story you might not know what they've been through oh but we all have trials we all have bad yes sir amen oh but it's just as true that we're delivered out of them all what of the Bible says many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivers out of them all amen we have Corruptions every one of us there's no good thing that dwth any of us amen we all have Corruptions and no this for a fact but it is true that we have an all sufficient savior amen man who overcomes those Corruptions amen if he's living in us we can overcome them and he enables us to put Satan under our foot amen amen he's enable me and you this morning to put the devil under our feet this morning amen thank God he's under our feet this morning amen we don't have to play second field to the devil amen we can tell him he's a liar to morning hey man you're a liar I'm Healed I'm delivered I'm an overcomer I'm a winner amen hallelujah it's wrong to deny still talking about the Christian experience it's wrong to deny that we've been through despondency what's that mean we feel like we're worthless feel like we're useless you don't have to raise your hand hands but I'm I wonder if I'm talking to someone this morning that feels like you've been through despondency feel like nobody cares oh but I'm telling you there's a God that cares this morning amen you've been through despondency feel like nobody cares you're no good you're useless you're worthless it's wrong to that we've all been through those things hey who am I who cares what why Lord why me Lord yeah been through despondency thought we was worthless thought we was no good but you know what you ought been you're somebody this morning he was worth dying for amen hallelujah if he'd have been the only one he'd have went to Calvary for you yeah amen so it's wrong to deny that we've been through despondency that crept along through the valley of humiliation a lot of us maybe has went through the valley of humiliation amen oh but we can say we've been through them through them but not remained in them Hallelujah he's a God he promised us that he wouldn't see us around it over it under it but he see us through our trials he see us through our battles I tell you what this morning I come to tell you that he'll see you through your despondency amen he'll see you through your battles he'll see you through your trials he'll see you through the valy of humiliation right we can say we've been through them but we've not remained in them we've not left our bones to be bleached in the burning son nor our bodies to the prey of the devil hallelujah oh I'm still talking about the Christian experience amen hallelujah oh we've been some Sorrows I remember when hey y'all facing sorrow right here you

how and they live like that they live like it was going to be just the next moment oh I wish we could be living like that this amen you know what if we could just live like that again amen we'd be careful what we say to one another we'd be careful how we act toward one another oh God we'd be careful what we thought we say God help me Lord let me not than that let me not say that Lord amen hey

and believe the love that God has toward us another thing this love is it's undeserved absolutely amen we don't deserve it with tears in our eyes we can say we're undeserving of God's love just think about it for a moment there's nothing in us to cause it our testimony is that God has loved us and we're sure of it because there's nothing in Us by Nature the scripture says in our flesh dwelleth no good thing what was in our old book there was nothing about it that he should love that's right we was against God am didn't have no thoughts of God we were Gentiles as the prophet said with clubs on

Lord I was this I was that we could go around I was this but yet he's forgiven me Hallelujah let me read this to you brother say the Mighty God unveiled 1964 we noticed another thing in the Old Testament said I have the scripture here in Exodus that the old Badger skins what did it do it hid the glory of God from the people the badger skins even people couldn't see it because it was a skin that held it the glory of God was behind the skin and now the glory of God is behind your skin that makes me want to shout amen the glory of God is behind your skin that's right he said and the Traditions don't see it it's inside the veil where his word is or was amen again the same message what's on the inside of that skin back there the old Badger skins which there was no Beauty we should desire it and when it was made flesh and dwelt Among Us it was still no Beauty we should desire it and now the same thing is today there's nothing in a manner woman that can be desired it's what's behind there that's what it is it's what's behind there well he said that fell I know he used to be a drunker he used to do this I don't care what he used to do what's hid behind that skin what is behind there what counts that's what the people is blinded that skin blinds people see all brother Wade used to do this sister June used to do this but what about now amen oh brother B said they want to talk about somebody well he he's a fanatic he went too far but what about those that didn't go far enough right I just want to stay right down the middle of the road amen hey what was he used to do yeah he used to but what is he now amen what is he now see he says it's the skins that blind he said that's what counts a skin that blinds me see they they I remember when that woman used to I know what she used to but what about now them skins that was once on the badger but now it's hiding the glory to God got it housed behind it it was on a animal but now it's housing the glory of God and so your skin be changed tonight to be made a housing Place amen right Hallelujah God dwelling in humanity a hous and place that's what I wanted to be do you know the love of God you know let me say it like this and then I got one more then I got a story then we'll get out of here I remember I preached this several years back I preached at our church on a Wednesday night somebody had invited me to go preach for him and we was going to leave the next day and take a few days early because my wife always wanted to go see the builtmore in ashon North Carolina and so I said okay so so I said well I got got to go preach up here said I tell you what we'll just take a few days and we'll go and I'll take up there you wanted to see it and so we'll go and so she was working at the day at daycare there

made a way that we can come too someday because I live you live also he said oh no wonder when men catch that Vision there's never been a man man could explain it they even tried to explain it losing their mind the great song oh love of God how rich and pure have fathomless and strong that last verse I believe the first verse is if we would ink the ocean F and where the sky the parchment made yes sir you know where that was found written on the insane wall and insane institution no man can never explain that love of God oh it can never be told what did for us my how could we place one Merit out there it's his grace from beginning to end I was lost undone and helpless no good nothing about it and he by his grace came and saved us oh my that's his that's my Lord that's his love that's his
