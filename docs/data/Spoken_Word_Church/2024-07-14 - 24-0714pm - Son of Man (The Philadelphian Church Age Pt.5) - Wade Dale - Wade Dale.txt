that we want the people to to continue on and rise up above all these things that bother us Lord and continue on with you father I pray that you'd bless us now take care of the sick be with those Lord that are not here with us we ask these things in Jesus name amen amen let's read Revelations 1:10 I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last what thou seest write in a book and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia Ephesus smrna pergamus thra Sardis Philadelphia is where we're in now and Lea and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and be turned I saw seven golden candlesticks let me ask you a question did anybody ever heard an audible voice and know that it was God you don't have to raise your hand but just think about it I mean we have this inward voice that speaks to us you know sometimes we call it a conscience sometimes it's the devil CU if he tells you something and it goes wrong it ain't God that's but you get that little still Small Voice that says hey don't do that or hey do this God don't have to do that folk he does it CU he loves you he does it cuz he knows you're going to make a mistake if you don't do it his way remember God's knows are the best yeses you'll ever get right so John saw that heard a voice that spake with him and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one likened the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about to PPS with a golden girdle Revelations 3 verse 7 to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write these things sayith he that is Holy he that is true he that ha the key of David openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth I Know Thy Works behold I have set before thee an Open Door and no man can shut it for thou Hast a little strength and Hast kept my word and Hast not denied my name behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan which say they are Jews and are not but do lie behold I will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved thee we'll continue on a little bit later we'll cover that in a little bit you may be seated Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word amen now as we see in the chart we know that that we're in the church age of 1 2 3 4 5 6 and that would be the Philadelphia age from 1750 to 1906 John Wesley came remember now John Wesley comes each messenger comes at the end of the previous age all right you see that there Luther come at the end of col the end of Columbus time to bring his message Wesley come at the end of Luther to bring his message he he brought it in the 1700s and passed away in the 1700s and then there's 1800s and 1900s that They carried on the message of John Wesley so we know that these ages lap over now remember though you and I as the bride in the end time we get all of the blessings and we get all of the curses all right so we get all of them you read that Revelations 1 2 and 3 that's us that's to the bride now we caught up in Revelations 4:1 and then we know that's to the Jews and we'll cover that when we cover some of the major doctrines of that that brother Brandon preached in and the L toy for the Church age so the church is a dominating female we know that we know that we do not that's why and and I was thinking about this yesterday brother brandham he was not against women that were right I had a minister asked me one time actually one that's not in the message anymore he said why did Brother Ram call women dogmate I said brother I said if you're not born again you're dogmate we're worthless if you're not born again you're worthless just Canon F brother didn't brother say Canon F just go right back to ashes just go right back to gases and you're no more so we all are but he was talking about a vile woman cuz he knew a vile woman would take you further remember what he said he said there' be more people in hell because of looking at a pretty woman and lusting after than the would any bar room in the whole country amen well you like it if you want to or not but we we got to do that with the church too we got to understand that we are the bride God has instilled in us to be not the head but part of the head and we got to understand too that that I was talking to to brother Chris yesterday or day before yesterday and you got to remember one thing once we get into this message of of the L of sin message with brother brandham that is The Headstone message someone ask us where is The Headstone it's in the bride it is the bride okay but he has instilled that upon us us that we're going to be the fullness of the godhead bodily we're going to be instilled with all these great things that the Lord Jesus himself is was who the son of man so now where is that son of man it's inside of you in human flesh so that makes you the Bride of Jesus Christ and part of The Headstone yes because remember man and woman is one God and man are one not two one but we know our position we know our place we're all feminist in the body of Christ we not want to user authority over the Lord Jesus you'll never make it and that's what happened in these Church ages they arship their authority over God and his word so that makes you what anti- word or anti- Christ all right so be careful with that let's not let's not Ur up authority over anybody let's be under the headship of Jesus Christ let's be under the headship of the message and accept that you sisters praise God you don't have to preach and you're not required what we're required to do amen you're not to be a doorstep or a door mat and you're not supposed to stay barefoot and pregnant all the time I know that's all what people said all the time but you have a job to do okay there is a fine line there you do have a job to do you know what the greatest job you can have is support your husband or your brothers or your ministry or your church support just really simple you don't have to study for a 4H hour message like I did today but you still need to study you still need to read your Bible you still need to be able to say Amen you still need to be able to know what you said when you say Amen there's a big difference there but that's your that's us and then we're to be submissive to the Lord and then he tells us what to do and we just do it he saids this is your responsibility you do it well what happened in the church ages when the ministry the true Ministry was loosed and it went out in power there was an opposition behind it there was another Ministry loosed that wanted to what Satan's what Satan want to do he don't want he wants to be above God he wants to be as God remember sitting in the temple but he wants to be God that's what gets him all the time you know like I said before I can just see God out in the middle of nowhere and he created Satan first so it was just him and him him and Satan or him and Lucifer right and then the Angels but now Lucifer had a position right he was the worship Angel he was perfect that's what the Bible says what God Said I made you perfect but he said I created you perfect God is not a Creator creation he's a Creator absolutely Satan is a creation and here goes God he says Let There Be and outo something out of nothing just goes and the devil being anointed and being a worship Angel he's like can I do that can I do that can I do that he said no stay in your place I'll do the creating you do the anointing and you do the worshiping and you you just anoint good anointing what I'm doing and then he'll make something else he go oh let let me do that let me do that what H what happened was the Bible says iniquity was found in his what in his heart what was iniquity knowing to do better or not doing it knowing he shouldn't do it he wanted to he wanted to so he goes to his angels and he says Hey I want to tell you something I think I can do a better job than that guy can and he sold them out you think boy that's kind of stupid no he sold a bunch of them out cuz he was smooth and Slick all right so that's who we've got to deal with when there's a Ministry loosed there's got to be opposition behind it remember what brother Brown said he said when the healing campaign hit the road he said hear everybody come in oil in the hand they started praying for the sick they started doing all the prayer lines and all these things right he said carnal impersonators right cuz they had oil in their hands and all this stuff and if they would have just stayed simple brother Brown stayed simple he didn't try to complicate it he had a Healing Ministry and that was it at that time and everybody wanted to you know like brother Brown said he said you know your man's got the ball and you trying to tackle him well are we trying to do the same thing are we trying to just but are we trying to say oh brother Don's got the ball and I don't want him to have it I want to have it we're on the same team that'd be kind of funny to be watching the football game and watch the guy at quarterback throw the ball to the receiver and his own man tackle him and The Field's wide open well that's what we're doing we need to be careful really careful cuz there's opposition there's two Ministries that was loosed right that was the real and the opposing Force now remember they getting closer together though as we come to the end time cuz his anointing as I was saying yet this morning at end of the service Satan is watching us and being religious he comes to our services and he's listening and he's seeing that we're coming to a Perfection that he can't attain to but listen he can pervert what we're coming to cuz remember when we leave this place guess what Satan is going to Incarnate a man and that's going to be God God of this evil age that's going to be the god of the people there's going to be signs wonders Miracles Fire coming out of his mouth maybe not so much fire but we know what it is it's words and he can actually do things brother R said Satan can pass out Supernatural gifts that's right so there'll be a lot of Supernatural going on and the whole world's going to just fall for it just like with this thing that happened yesterday there's a somebody sent a a message on uh one of the social media and had a had a an angel thank God it was a man but had an angel hovering over Trump standing at the podium you know and and knocking the bullets out of the way you just wait this world is waiting for somebody to get them out of this and they'll get their Superman I don't know if it's going to be Donald Trump but they going to get him out of from somewhere that's the world's looking for that and it's just like brother Mike said and it it's true Constantine was the world Superman everybody loved him man they he put church and state together he did all this he was the biggest deceiver there ever was brother B said that's where they made their fatal mistake was when church and state came together when Jezebel and Ahab married each other so that what we think is going to be really nice it may be our downfall it may be what carries this thing really I mean forward you talk about if Trump would have died yesterday there'd have been a civil war there' hadd been people shooting people it almost happened at the White House four years ago amen I know that's politics but just be careful just watch let's not get caught up in the in the let's not get caught up in the um glamour it's all run by the devil every man doesn't matter if it's Biden or Trump or whoever it is it's all run by the devil they are not born again Christians but they can profess they are as Constantine did he said I'm doing this for what for God I'm doing this to get the religion back together to get us all one well that's the devil but I will restore sayeth the Lord and we are part of that that's what I'm trying to get to we are the restoration process toward the very end where that seed that went in the ground who died there 2,000 years ago who died the son of man God can't die the Son of God can't die the son of man died so he went into the ground come back into the Son of God dispensation but brother B said right at the end that son of man is going to the full seed grain is going to come back in power and I just truly believe it it's got to be it's going to be and you and I if we want to be a part of it we've got to go I just say go you want you go just go we got to go so the first three ages had the pure word of God the fourth one in the ground now not that they didn't have the word of God they didn't have all the word of God neither did Luther or Wesley they didn't have all the word of God put together but in the end time today the words should be back together and putting the word back together puts a word back in power to know that we have to go through justification we have to go through sanctification we have to know that we're born again it's not just where this great seed and we always just was and just one day it popped open and here I am no it's a process it's a birth a birth it's never changed the Bible's never changed Jesus said you must be born again and you know it was so real to Nicodemus though he went back to the Natural side and said must I go back in my mother's womb what and come back out water blood and life Jesus said no you got to be born from above by water blood and life justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost so we know who went in the ground we know the son of man went in the ground there what went in the ground here at Nia was a portion of that but it's continued on to where now you got the full grain with me and you over on this side because these guys were reformers brother randam couldn't come as a reformer now he stood on their platform because they did start the reformation and they did start part of the restoration is everybody with me on that brother B didn't fully just come on the scene and restore everything no the just shall live by faith was restored by Luther he had a message the just the the sanctification process John Wesley the Pentecost with the gifts speaking in tongues bringing the gift brother R said the Holy Ghost came himself to give the gifts back to the church then brother rham comes and brings the word of God pure and unadulterated and now that's what we're living in now yes all right so they were we were not reformed remember what I said about reformed they can reform you but if you're once alcoholic you'll always be one in AA and all the different things but we believe in what we believe in restoration restoring back to where you never did that in the first place am I listen to Brother Richard the other day when he preached our ordination service he said that man is here to take us back across that Chasm to put us back in the Garden of Eden remember brother Ram said three-fold purpose all God was he poured into Christ all Christ into who the church take her back to the Garden of Eden now if he takes her back to the Garden of Eden before there was a fall that's where you and I need to be standing at and that's what this message did it takes us back to what that Genesis 1 126 man had there not been a fall we realize now yes I realize now I always was eternal I always was with God or I never was he can't change his mind but I had to come here to receive it when I come through the my mother's womb I was lost when I came through a natural womb you were lost no hope done you didn't have God in you nowhere cuz God won't dwell in an unclean vessel now he listen he followed you all your life he follows you all your life yeah I believe there's an angel hovered over you if you're a born again Christian brother B said we got Angel and then some of us it's plural well I'm one of them so brother John they got Round the Clock shifts on me and I've always thought you know one brother BR said one wormwood could destroy the whole world with water I need one to kind around me to destroy all them demons at one time oh we don't believe in angels oh we don't believe in spirit oh okay well good Baptist listen I believe there's a battle going on all the time we just can't see it the Devil Wants You Dead every second of your day and especially when you get a revelation that he can't get I told y all that the other week that's the difference in Satan and us we are created what I'm looking at right now but in the image of God in Genesis 1 that was before the devil the devil can't get eternal life so when you get eternal life in your soul Satan it's hard for him to realize he can't get in there anymore and it makes him mad am he's the author of being mad that's right but we got to start in the process so the last three Church Ages which would be we need to get a church ages one like that so we can I keep looking for one and there's not one popping up over here anywhere you know what what I just showed the church ages so the last three ages completes the birth that we are that we realize every by brother br's saying that for us he's not saying that for those other people they're gone they're dead he's saying it for live people this ministry is for live people absolutely so we're alive now so we got to be justified and he shows and looks back to Martin Luther and he says the just shall live by faith you got to have faith to know that this right here that God eradicates by faith in what Christ did at the cross the sins of your past nature do you really believe that if you don't then and there is got to be a time where you got to believe it you can't get born again without believing that God has eradicated not hid or covered eradicated and he can't even find them anymore Satan can't find them anymore God can't even find them anymore cuz he set up a place if he's a Creator Bob he going to have a place he created that sea he created that sea of forgetfulness just so he could throw your sins in it and he can't even get to it what sins you talking about see he gets that all the time the devil says can't you see that he's like I just hear their voice saying forgive me Lord amen I hear the voice saying Lord I'm sorry I did that I'll try not to do it again Lord forgive me they like well I saw him do it he said I didn't so who's the most righteous God's the most righteous Satan's a liar God knows that that's right he pull over nothing over on on the Lord no sir so being justified freely by his grace through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus whom God has set forth as a perpetuation through faith in his blood not cow's blood or horses blood or or the blood of bulls and goats and all those different things that what covered if you look in the Bible that word means Capo there's a there's a covering but it's still there this is your sin it covered the sins of those people in the Old Testament until Jesus Christ come and then that blood left and then the blood of Jesus Christ covered all that everybody with me now you got your sins that you started with and you come down through here time and you ask God to truly forgive you of your past guess what gone not covered Hallelujah not maybe no he's the just and the justifier he's the only one that can clean us up listen don't try to clean yourself up that's right ask God to clean you up we're not strong enough even born again people we're not strong enough all together to be able to fight the devil brother R said we're not even a match for it but we do have somebody an advocate a high priest that's already went in for us I know this is simple salvation but some needs it we need to get born again and we need to do it right we need to be justified and know that we're Justified Sanctified and know that we're Sanctified and then get the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul not just a covering but in your soul to burn the old you out to make you a new creature in Christ or a new creation only God can create Satan can cover that and pervert it but he never can he couldn't create it God created ever soul that ever was on the face of this Earth past and present but what does he do he gives us a choice a willing person as we read this morning somebody willing to give up Abraham you're 99 years old he said God I know it he said I'm done I give up I've been trying to do this thing for you I've been trying to do this thing for you and God said Abraham that's where you should have started at but remember he knows we're human and we try to help God let go and let God okay now that doesn't mean go sit down in your chair and a week later you're still sitting there no remember what I said about getting a job you pray to get a job why a't you got a job well I'm just waiting on God to you know knock on the door and and and already filled my application out a willing person willing to get up and go out and get a job God will bless you if you'll do it right all right so he says de to declare whom the God has set a perpetuation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed that's justification everybody with me all right let's don't get lost through here therefore we conclude now Paul concludes us brings this whole matter up that a man is justified by faith without the Deeds of the law there is no law going to save you right but remember you are under the law until you're born again yes you are a do and don't person until you're born again cuz remember if you go to the white Throne judgment and you're not born again you going to be judged by what you do amen the Bible says your works I don't want to go anywhere Brother Gary by my works I want if I stand in his righteousness no though he's already been to the Judgment seat praise the Lord he's already been to that judgment seat and I've got to realize I was in him when he went there when he resurrected I resurrected when he said captivity captive that was me he did it for me you got to say he did it for you but he did it for me I needed it I needed that Advocate I needed a perpetuation yes listen I didn't need let me put it this right I didn't need somebody just to cover what I did I needed somebody that could eradicate and like I said before even forget what I did that's who I need cuz if your one sin is remembered you're in trouble oh yes that's why brother Bram comes to the end of his Road he says I'm looking at the what sinless come on sinless bride of Jesus Christ sinless the Bible says without spot or wrinkle that's here do we believe that though do we believe that do we believe that we are in the right Camp you got to believe you're in the right Camp even though people fall away you got a couple of friends that passed away brother Dale and different ones brother edin different ones are falling you know going to the other side but like I said before that they had lived their whole Natural Life to get to that point that's what you and I need to remember that we think too much of life sometimes well I'll say Amen too you said it brother brother D said come on it is we're stuck to this world too much we got too and me included we got too much of I need to and and if I don't and and world yeah world I thought Jesus said if you love the world and the things of the world the love of the father is not even in you I don't love this world but you know what God did he did like what brother Bob said he's put us in a place to where we got to suffer a little bit to hate this place what if right now we were all changed back to 20 years old in this cursed world that we live in that ain't even right you know what ain't right I think I was talking to the lady at at the we were talking about old age and I thought you know what Methuselah was right about the middle Church age he was born and he's 900 years old now see that how see see how that'll make your brain work can you imagine that I mean we even In Our Lifetime dad's lifetime he went from a horse in a buggy to to flying in an airplane and Astronaut much less you take 900 years back there wasn't even United States back then the 1400s all the I mean you're going back and you're going man thank God we don't live long is what I'm trying to say thank God we don't have 400 years to live but praise God we're going to have an eternity to live and we got to get through this one first why did he put us down here to prove he's God AB that's the whole thing to prove he's God he put us right here and he said Satan watch him watch him have you considered my servant job Satan wasn't even looking at him but brother brandham I believe when he come I believe God said hey have you considered my servant William brandham oh you got a hedge built around him he said okay I'll take it off okay I'll take his wife I'll take his baby I'll make him commit suicide if I can and he would have if he could have that's right but God didn't allow it I want to say today have you considered my bride right yes sir why would he say anything else he's proud of us he's proud of who we are even as much as garbage as we are in he's proud of us he's proud you don't you love your wife all the time that maybe sometimes you don't like her I'm saying both husband and wife right say praise the Lord right Ain there times that you really just don't want to be around your wife well I'm going to get in trouble anyway you don't even you don't even want her to cook you anything I got SP at J one time I I don't even know I don't want that well pray for me I mean I just see all y'all laughing and smiling like it ain't never happened to me well let's get back on the let's go here but that's the way God is though God's a loving God he loves us anyway you love your wife anyway you make up all it's all good you make you make back up I hope but remember God don't change he loved you to begin with and he can't unlo you that's I can't un love my wife I just can't when she's gone a couple of days I cry in the corner with my thumb stuck in my mouth my deepest darkest Secrets have just been let go I tell them people at work I said my wife has left me for an older man again I said I want to be just I won't be able to eat nothing and they're all just rolling their eyes they're going yeah she went and visit your Dad she'll be back in a little while go to McDonald's so you can't get no can't get no sympathy from nobody but God does love us he can't UNL us absolutely we have our bad days we have our horrible days right but God never leaves you or forsakes you never by no means does he now listen he will withdraw himself from you so that you can pout a little bit he did with the even did with the prophet remember brother R said you owe me an answer God he said God let me stew for three months three months before he gave me an answer listen God will answer you when he wants to we don't he doesn't owe us an answer we owe him one ourself but you think what God did he loved us so much he sent us a prophet in the end time he gave us a message that nobody else has he gave us a message that's got all the power that God ever put into a group of people he's put it into his bride in the end time and I believe I'm looking at her amen amen the Bride of Jesus Christ the best of the best hallu battle hardened veterans somebody's been through something the angel of the church in Lea these things sayth he that is Holy he that's true he that ha the key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth I Know Thy Works be I have set before thee what an open door and no man can shut it for thou Hast a little strength and Hast kept my word and not denied my name we know it started in 1750 now remember Martin Luther was I mean John Wesley was born in the early 1700s and died 80 years later so he wasn't in the last half of the church age but the people carried it on but I'm going to read you something in just a minute what he said or maybe I took it out but he said I the only the the scared Martin Luther he knew what he knew just shall live by faith so you come over here to John Wesley his his his senses of the of the scriptures and and the spirit was broadened but what he feared he didn't fear death he feared that after he died that they would set up a denomination around his teachings and that's exactly what they did right I'm going skip some of this stuff and get down to here you remember what John Wesley I was talking about the other day when he went to Georgia to Savannah with James oakle Thorp to convert to Indians he was goinging over here to show him Jesus Christ and he absolutely got ripped apart Charles got in trouble in in Florida and he got in trouble he got in trouble with the Indians and he says right he returned to England crying I went to America to convert the Indians but oh who shall convert me he knew he didn't have then what he thought he had I pray to God that we do the same thing that we get to a place that we realize that either we do or we don't have what we need to have amen if we don't we can do something about it if we don't and we don't do anything about it then God forbid we're in horrible shape but if you realize like look at this man he's lived his whole life in the ministry he's heading on a mission trip to convert someone to Christianity thinks he's got it sees a group called The moravians who were living a cleaner life than he was they were having problems on the ship the moravians Just prayed and thank the Lord he saw something that he didn't have and you know who orchestrated that don't you God himself orchestrated that but remember what happened to John Wesley is he realized it in his walk in life he realized he didn't have what he thought he had and remember when he came over and said that remember John his brother Charles said he he berated him said John you've got the Holy Ghost how many of you heard that before oh you've got the Holy Ghost you you you do missionary work you sit in a message Church you listen to tapes you read books come on Charles was mad at him but after a while Charles got converted too so this is what he said right here he once remarked that he did not fear that the name of Methodist would leave the Earth but that the spirit might take its flight and boy we know it has man they were all over the YouTube pride week was all in the Methodist churches they had their gay flags all over in the Methodist churches that were United now the ones that are around here are not in it all right but they still part of a system John Wesley would absolutely roll over in his grave if he saw what what he started and what it produced I want to ask you a question if brother Brandon would have come back and do the same would he do the same thing would he do the same thing yes he would yes he would all these people sitting at home listening to tapes all these people doing this that brother R taught against I'm going to preach anyway brother Brown never told us we need to sit home and listen to tapes never he said and listen like I said before his word does not supersede the Bible the Bible tells us that it takes a fivefold Ministry to perfect us he didn't say it took William brandom to do it it said it took a five-fold Ministry that caught the message as John Heard a Voice and turned what did he see he couldn't interpret it but praise God me and you can interpret that when we hear that voice we can turn and we can see the son of man in a group of people yes in the end time amen today yes sir that's right we don't have to guess we know where God is we know what he's doing yes sir I hope you open your eyes and realize that you're a part of it and did the angel of the church and lay out to see he that is true has the Key of David openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openest now watch what brother Ram says it does not mean true in just a sense that it's opposite to false it expresses the perfect realization of an IDE idea has contrasted with its partial realization as I pronounced this morning you got shadows and you got the real listen this is not a shadow this is real this is not a shadow of the son of man this is the son of man walking on back back on Earth again in two feet I believe that just with all my heart I believe that if I don't make it I hope y'all do but I believe it with all my heart that God is walking on two feet somewhere on this Earth in a group of people and he will manifest what he said he will manifest we can sit today and we can pray until 6 o' in the morning that the sun's not going to come up Sun's going to come right up why because brother Louise said God said so but God but God said the sun's going to shine then we we know what the talk about the Mana what is true versus false Jesus said I'm the True Vine so there must be a false Vine but the True Vine is the one that brings forth what true or good fruit or as I said before the tuning fork is the is the what would you call it sister Astra it would be the it'd be the the dividing it would be whatever it is if it's going to be a c you got to go to that tuning Fort and hit it and that's C that's whatever your sounds are that's your um a constant everything has to come to a constant so what the word of God is a constant right this is what we have to come back to like I said before it doesn't matter what you bring if it doesn't match this it's not right that's right if you hit that symbol and it's supposed to be C and it comes up D there's something wrong so we have to have a standard that's what I'm trying to say we have to have a standard we have to have have a Mark that we go back to and have a standard I got some um I weigh my arrows that I shoot with and I've got this little bitty um scale that that is in grains cuz you you you weigh Arrows by grains and I've got this thing that says 15 Point whatever grains and that's my standard that's what I calibrate my scale with because I mean I'm talking about micr grains like 001 is what I'm trying to get it to so I put that thing on there and I hit the button and if it goes to zero that's exactly or 15.2 something grain that's what it is that's my standard same way with the word of God the that word of God is a standard that's why we need to read our Bible as much or more than we read message books I'm gonna tell you something if you can't prove these major doctrines by the Bible yourself and not say brother brandham said I heard a message preacher not too long well it's been about 10 or 15 years ago he said I'm nothing but a message parakeet I thought you're lost cuz a parakeet only says what the next person says and you know what if you walk in and teach that parakeet something else it's going to say that too I am not a message parakeet you're not either amen we get the essence of the message and we preach it to you the way God provided I believe through a prophet messenger along with the Bible but this is our standard this is our set weight that's what it we put it on that scale this is what it is right here all right everything else is false but this and we know the message is not false so if you think something contrary is contrary to the to the Bible then whose problem is it yours it's yours and mine that we don't have a teacher that can teach us how to get back to this right here I'm not you know what I'm not throwing away I read mess well read messages all the time I don't listen tape cuz I fall asleep but I can read I can read but what about reading this get back to the good old Bible and then you can see one God out of the Bible yes well explain one God there brother Donnie when now brother brandham said now how you going to get somebody to even talk to you when you say that name but you'll say let's go into the Bible and let's look in the first let's look at the first here in in Exodus 20 let's see it says oh behold oh Israel the Lord thy God is one God abely that's right uh I and my father are one uh the Lord God is our healer Redeemer savior he's not seven different things he's seven different names for one person or seven different compound names of Jehovah can you do that without saying brother random said then you've got the true essence of the message cuz you know what's ringing in the back of your head what brother randam said that's where we got it we heard the voice of that angel as John heard that voice we heard the voice and then the voice turned us to the Bible and then the Bible says this this this and this and we say that ain't nothing but the truth but be able to explain it to your neighbor number one live in front of your neighbor first H then be able to explain to him right I don't know where that came from but let's go he had the Key of David now it says in Isaiah 22:22 and the key of the House of David will I lay upon his shoulder now brother R is explaining that we if we talk about a key we think we got it in our hand brother John and we go over here and we open the door right but now the Bible tells us a little bit something different to that it means in the Old Testament thank God for a prophet that could take us back to the old Testament what the Key of David signified at that time is a mere shadow that time his time which is now fulfilled in Jesus standing in the midst of the lampstands it has to do with our Lord after his resurrection and not his Earthly pilgrimage all right is everybody with me but what does this key signify the answer lies in the position of the key it's not when it goes in the door it's not worn around his neck it's not in his hand it is not placed in the hands of other men or the verse could not be saying that he alone has the use of that key for he alone opens and shuts and no man has that right but Jesus himself isn't that right but where is that key it's on his shoulder but what the shoulder have to do with that read Isaiah 9:6 and the government shall be upon his shoulder but what does this mean the answer is this the phrase government upon his shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony oh it's bringing more light now it's coming from the wedding ceremony of the East when the bride has been committed to the groom she takes off her veil and places it over the groom's shoulder signifying that not only is she under his Dominion that's what we were talking about dominating female that she has transferred her rights to him do we have any rights nope we get them all up we have no rights at all the only thing we have the rights is in here oh we got a Bill of Rights we got all these rights and we got these things that we can do and can't do but what about this right here back to our standard now watch that she has transferred her rights to him in other words that's why sisters you lose your name you lose your maiden name because you're not a Thomas anymore you have give that right up to someone else which is her husband but now remember though once she transfers that responsibility to him it's your responsibility to take care of her amen all you Brothers it's your responsibility to take care of your wife remember brother Brian said she won't have to give an account for you but you'll have to give an account for her wow you know why because of that because of what I just said a dominating female is over or strips herself above the headship of the man and he'll have to give an account for that that she has transferred a right to him that he is the head but also look that he Bears the responsibility and the care that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility and that beloved is the Key of David God being Sovereign he formed You by Divine decree exactly who would be his bride amen now that I agree with I agree 100% he knew who she was he took care of her made sure you got here CU he had a piece of him waiting on you he decreed Genesis 1: 126 I'm going to have a bride and she's going to have dominion she's going to have power she's going to be she is him yes she did not choose him I'm sorry he forew by Divine decree exactly who would be in his bride he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not come on her own he died for her he washed her in his own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him and him alone she is wholly committed to him and he accepts the obligation do we really do that or do we really try to figure things out oursel hello somebody she's wholly committed to him and he accepts the obligation didn't Jesus say in the scripture cast your burdens on somebody else cast your burdens on yourself I ain't helping you no he said cast your burdens on me why cuz you're my wife cast your burdens on me he is her head for Christ is the head of his church as Sarah called Abraham Lord even so the bride is happy that he is her Lord he speaks and she obeys for that is her Delight do you really Delight in being bride or do you really just fall asleep in the church service but have men heeded this truth now watch have they esteemed his person who alone has full sovereignty and authority over his church I say no because of the dominating female thing for in every age the church has been governed by hierarchy a priesthood an Apostolic succession closing the door of mercy and Grace To whom it will and instead of assuming the love and responsibility of the church it has with mercenary lust prayed upon her and destroyed her the clergy lived the luxury while the poor Church fed on the husk of abuse and not one age did any different each bound itself to organization and put the government upon men and committed the church to that government wow the the next scripture says he that openeth and no man shth and shutteth and no man openeth now the great missionary age Brotherly Love was the age of missions and what I telling you sanctification what's God doing he's sending he's sending the message today and all during the world in out into the world to do what to sanctify a church sanctify by the washing of the water of the word what are we preaching the water of the word we're preaching the word so that that water can wash you it wasn't happening in every nation but God opened a door to the greatest missionary age you had all brother R tries to name a few he doesn't even get close to naming all of them all the great people that's went out uh the Livingston and different people like that that went all over the world and preached the gospel why to get a people ready so that God can speak to them in the next step and what happened they denied it some took it some denied it now the great missionary age brotherly love the age of missions let me just name to you some of the Great Men he just wrote some of the names down John Wesley George Whitfield Charles fny Dwight Moody William KY the great missionary that went to India in 177 3 David Livingston to South Africa see all these some of those great men I got names of plenty of them here great men that lived in that brotherly love the black man the white man the brown man the yellow man all walls were broken down and these men went out into the mission Fields Brotherly Love stretching out a hand to All Nations everywhere and it was opened up to them that they could go another Open Door age because they couldn't before that they couldn't have done it the papacy of Rome in other words what had it so crushed wouldn't let them travel wouldn't let them do these or they either got there first and injected their Doctrine in but God was going to make sure that his gospel got out he's going to send them the papacy of Rome and so forth had it also closed up till they couldn't go but in that age the door was open cuz he said it was an Open Door age they opened up many doors during that age the doors to the gospel the doors to the mission field the door back to Christ and everything was opened up during that age and you can see what they did the Brethren done a great job out of it see we give all those names out like that and we say well they wouldn't like brother Bram no but you know what they'll have converts in glory that will be bride because they had a message for their hour now they weren't prophets remember they could be reformers still they reformed the people back but they didn't it wasn't a prophet to restore everything back there had to be just one of them right right one for for every age everybody all right with that so I said the corn grew and after a while it got a tassel on it and that tassel looked B down to the leaf and said ha you ain't got nothing you old former lutherans see I I'm the breed of the great missionary time the wind blowed and the little tassels fell off like that and dropped down that's Wesley sanctification that was the greatest missionary age we've ever had has been the wesleyian church and during the time of Wesley even exceeds this age the westle and church age it was a missionary age and it scattered what did it do it scattered it brother rown said the seed is not air with the Shu I want you to watch this we'll close right here cuz we got to cover this notice see how close it looks Matthew said 24:24 the two spirits in the last days the church Spirit of the church people see how he rewarded that the church Spirit not God Spirit the church Spirit of the church people and the bride Spirit of the Bride people makes some different would be so close together till it would deceive the very elect if it was possible that's how close look how it's come through the stalk now notice we're going to type something here Luther in the church age of bringing forth the bride seed was the same in spirit just one little grain of seed Luther stood out on it in other words the two shoots that was justification by faith he was the very type of Hagar the stalk now remember what was Hagar she's a Bond woman she was not the one the promised son was to come through but God allowed her to bring forth ishma and ishma was a wild child we know that but God blessed him and some of them will be there but some of the radicals will not but some of them will be there but that was Hagar that was what the Wild Child the that was the that was the uh remember the seed is what God's looking for right but the plants got to be there before the seed can come so he's not going to do away with the plant but the plant the stock is not the promised son Hagar did not produce the promised Sun she was part of the economy but she didn't produce the promised Sun notice Westley was a type of Sarah the Philadelphia and the age of love that brought forth the tassel that in Wesley's age there was more missionaries than any other age we've seen the great missionary age of John Wesley's time so now it's coming better because Sarah was the true one but it's heading toward more the tle excuse me it's heading toward more the seed now through Sarah shall thy seed be Sarah wasn't a seed she received seed and brought forth a child all right but Pentecost represented Mary all right why the shouting good time watch the last stage of it now she has not the seed it looked like it but it wasn't it it was a carrier or something that what something that protected the seed listen between Martin Luther John Wesley between John Wesley and brother R's message lay out of CN age there had to be a Pentecostal age to bring those gifts back to show that something was coming that was the grain it looked like the grain but it wasn't the grain you and I are the grain cuz what was the grain the grain was the son of man the stock wasn't the son of man had the life of the son of man in it but it was not the son of man the son of man is the wheat the plant The Germ but Pentecost represented Mary Mary the last age of it now she was not the seed yet the life of the seed was in her all right but it didn't mature hadn't m matured yet right I feel very religious it hadn't matured yet it was there but it wasn't matured in other words the life was going through it but brother John he called for seed he didn't call for stalk he didn't call for tassel he didn't call for green leaves he didn't call for a covering he called for that grain to be just exactly you can't plant the husk and it come up you can't take the stalk and stick it in the ground it'll die it's not going to come to seed but you let it come to seed take it out dry it out get the husk off of it take it back plant it in the ground it'll bring you the same thing again and that's what you and I we have come to seed time so it is with our Pentecostal age that we're living in there has to got to come forth a word of God that's inner or undenominational outside of the Realms of that denomination real quick let's look at sanctification just for a minute because this is what this is what this age represented it was cleaned up what Luther was not dirty but Luther was not totally clean he still had denominational doctrines and all the other things right he was pretty much a rascal CU he he caused a war and he caused several hundred people to die and all that stuff God just God listen you say well that was bad we were worse we weren't living under the word of God we were living out from under the word of God we were doing what we wanted to do but he cleaned us up and set us aside for use our purpose and then I told you the glass about representing the glass now watch this is what sanctification is look as a process now remember what I said this morning justification is not a process everybody with me on that justification is not a process it's a it's an event that happens that God takes your sins away Cuts them off that's what brother B said chops off now when you chop something off it's separated from what it was attached to so your sins were separated done away with an act of justification but an act of sanctification means becoming more holy through time and it just makes sense we're not all clean at the same time we all got our demons that we fight for years or months or even days and then sometimes God will take them away right then but remember don't question God he may leave something on you like Bob was talking about he may leave something on you to try you to see what you'll do about it he knows what you'll do about it but you don't like a child growing up into adulthood Christians become more Sanctified over time 1 Peter 2:2 this means that Christians should expect to make progress to grow and become we ought to try this become more loving kind and humble and self-controlled over their life John 17:17 sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is the truth questions and answers 1959 the Holy Spirit what you're believing unto eternal life now watch this watch this right here the holy spirit's what you are believing unto eternal life but when the Holy Spirit comes it is eternal life Shake Yourself just a minute we'll be done five minutes it is eternal life are you believing too or you got it you got to realize that you're believing unto you're begotten of the spirit at sanctification cuz remember God won't dwell in an unclean vessel so he's got to clean you up so that he can deal with you amen you're begotten of the spirit at sanctification but never born of the spirit until the Holy Ghost comes in that's correct a baby's got life in the womb of a mother little muscles are quivering now remember that's not human life hello that's not human life that's like he said nature life that the muscles are twitching but it's not a person yet that's right a baby's got life in the womb of the mother little muscles are quivering it's a life but it's a different life when it breathes the breath of life into its nostrils it's different amen my dear methis Brethren Pilgrim Holiness nazarine the baptism of the Holy Ghost is different from sanctification that's right sanctification is the cleansing which is preparation of life but when the Holy Ghost comes in it is life preparation is cleaning the vessel that's what John Wesley's message did it clean the vessels up so God can use them more so that God can pour out his holy spirit on a group of people that could speak in tongues that could heal the sick raise the dead have all the signs and wonders he had to clean the church up listen he had to clean you up too amen huj preparation is cleaning the vessel I'm looking at vessels today that's the vessel God's looking at the Holy Ghost is filling of the vessel all right sanctification is cleaning the vessel the Holy Ghost is filling the vessel sanctification means cleans and set aside for service the holy spirit is put is put it in service you are the vessel that God cleaned up how can I overcome last quote First under justification water baptism second under the new birth look look how look how he words that second under the new birth of Wesley now it ain't the new birth of you sanctification is not the new birth in this time God's moved up everybody with me second under the new birth of Wesley sanctification which cleanses and thirdly under the baptism of the Holy Spirit putting that Sanctified vessel into service the word sanctify means a compound Greek word which means clean and set aside for service set aside for service now the Holy Spirit puts it in service and we'll notice when the unclean Spirit has gone out from a man he walks in dry places that's exactly what the church has done watch what he says Baptist methodists those who believed in sanctification then Jesus said the unclean spirit that went out returns back to this church body okay words this this is God wording this for us you know that don't you it's not brother bradam this is God wording it for us so that we could read it right today 2024 God knew we'd read this quote and that's how he put it that's how he was written that was spoke you don't believe that do you you don't believe God had that you don't believe God had that message so so much to where he spoke it to where 50 years or 60 years later he knew we'd use it in our sermon to bring a point the unclean spirit that went out returned turns back to this church body and finds the house garnished swept clean living Pure Clean lives all right but then if that house isn't filled occupied then he comes in with seven other evil demons worse than he was in the last stage of this place place it's seven times worse than it was at the first place they had been better to stay Lutheran than it would be to receive that light and fail to follow it so will the Pentecostal see you know what I mean the house is garnished what happened then when the enemy that went out under sanctification now watch was that was washed out all right remember that in Luke unclean Spirit goes out house is swept and garnished I mean cleaned up every corner returned back and found the house not filled with the Holy Spirit now the state of the church is joined with the league of churches the World Council of churches and it's a state now that connects it with Roman Catholicism and all the rest and now it's seven times worse as it was when it come out of Lutheranism that's where man takes it that's where man takes it not God God's got a program sir and that program is not going to be altered it's not going to be changed but you know what that plan is that plan is he saw somebody receive that plan and become that plan he saw somebody that would say hey that ain't nothing but the truth and quit looking over here and start looking over here quit looking at our own self quit looking at church quit looking at church look at self work on self that's where man takes it but not God cuz God's fixing to take it from the Methodist and he's fixing and to give it over to the Pentecostals then we know what the Pentecostal done with it they cabbage down on this gift is it and God moved right on God moved through every Church age he moved on and on and on let's stand to our feet you love the Lord he's good and his Mercy endures forever are you a filled vessel today have you been filled up I know some of you is fed up cuz sometimes I get that way but you got to be filled up when you get fed up get sick and tired of being sick and tired get sick and tired of that Samson going around and around but you know one day Samson realized he was getting stronger again because his hair was growing he knew he was in a place that was the only place that God wanted him to get his strength back and I'm like what one preacher said one time he said you see how deceived they were they were standing there watching him and mocking him and his hair every day was getting longer and they never realized it they thought they thought his ability was in his no it was in that hair that was growing I if I'd have been there I barara I'd shave it every day but what did God do he hid it in the Simplicity of just watching that old man with no eyes not old man young man with no eyes pushing it well we got him now yeah we got him now and you know what Samson like brother R said one day Samson reached back he said oh they got it coming cuz you're hiding yourself in Simplicity God you're going to give me my strength back Samson stood that one day and he said One More Time Lord just one more give me one more chance to write my wrongs and I'll take down more Philistines than I ever did in my entire life and one day they let him number two they let him off that wheel they should have left him in that wheel one day the old got boy that was that was there he said lean me up against that post he didn't know which post it was but I believe by Revelation he realized that was the two pillars that held the whole place up if you're God L he'll take you where you need to go whether you're blind or not amen he said lean me up against that post son he leaned up against that post and like I said he reached back and he went oh I think it's long enough now I feel the power of God back again he said just lean me up against that other one he lean said I'm kind of tired he leaned him up against this one that little boy is like dude you can't see you're here they're mocking you they hate you you've been in that wheel for I don't know how long what are you going to do he said just hang hang on a minute he put his hands out now remember he's a little bitty kid he wasn't no big Hercules he put his hands out and the little boy was like man he's kind of crazy but something I Believe come in that boy's mind I remember long hair strength and I don't believe that boy was one of the 3,000 that got killed I believe he High tailed it out the door but when Samson all he done was is he said One More Time Lord just give me one more chance I'll make up for those years I'll make up for this time that these Philistines have mocked you and me cuz they were mocking him they were mocking God through Samson where's your God Samson where's where's where's your strength at Samson then didn't he realize he had long hair again then all of a sudden he just took one big push and he pushed both pillars out and I bet you them pillars were this big around cuz what it was I believe it was an arch that was holding everything up and they were up in the top floor partying where's your God Samson and I believe Samson just said you're fixing to see him your whole world's getting ready to Tumble down because I'm back to where God wanted me to be are we where God wants us to be have we grown our locks back sure we've had problems we've have had our head shaved a couple of times amen but God let it all grow back out and he hid it from the people and then the strength came back to Samson oh he died that day physically but he took 3,000 Philistines with him that were unbelievers I pray that what we do will take down that many unbelievers in this world and convert them but he said One More Time Lord just once more visit me one more time let me feel your spirit One More Time Lord he felt it the whole of his life every time he'd get in a situation he'd reach back and pull one of them curls and he'd say oh you're with me kill a thousand Philistines kill a bear and a Lon Bear Hands kind of a feat but when when deala got a hold of him he fell let's don't fall let's don't fall and if we do fall let your hair go back out don't care if you got to go through that Wheel of Life you know that Wheel of Life everybody's on it right well pray for me everybody's on it right everybody everybody's on that Wheel of Life right well finally finally Samson he said okay I've had enough when we going to say we've had enough and let's take down some of these Giants that's so so bothers us where God can't speak to us and I'm talking about all of us where God just can't even speak to us anymore I want to be where God can speak to me freely speak to you freely and not have any reservation with speaking to you not not well well brother way we want him to speak through you well I hope he does speak through me but guess what he's going to speak through you too we're the bride I'm not your husband spiritually yeah I'm your head here at church but he's the head of all we look to him not to one person God won't share his glory with nobody never will he but we give him then all the all the glory cuz what did Samson do he said Lord one more time he was speaking directly to God he said Lord just give me one more chance cuz he knew his strength came from the Lord his strength didn't come from down here on the earth it came from God with that vow that he took he said Lord I'm back in place he said just visit me one more time I hope he visits us one more time let's sing a song in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit within me create in me oh a clean heart [Music] oh God and renew right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from thy presence oh Lord take not my Holy Spirit from [Music] me restore unto me the joy of thy [Music] salvation and renew a right Spirit Within Me cre me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit within [Music] me create in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit Within Me Oh cast me not away from th presence oh Lord not thy Holy Spirit from me [Music] restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and renew a right Spirit within me you know we got those examples in the Old Testament but what about a Believer what about a Believer that's got the Holy Ghost in their soul what a power that is we don't have to have our hair grow out man told me one time he said wouldn't I Jesus had long hair I said if you la like him you can have it that's right of course he didn't say no more but he took a Nazarite vow if you'll take that Nazarite vow and do exactly what Jesus did absolutely but you can't we have to depend on God Amen okay that's why we cut our hair and the women don't cut their hair sorry I cut this thing off that's why we have that's why we our men we cut our hair and we women we don't cut their hair it's a vow that we take before God and I told him I said if you'll act like Jesus Christ you have your hair as long as you want to I had a brother come to me one time cuz I was I was preaching here been years ago and he said uh cuz brother brand said you that men would have Shaggy Long Hair you look up the word Shaggy and you'll see it because he didn't believe it he didn't believe you know he believ that we going to be clean cut and all that so I pulled up the quote where brother Brown said Here Come Those men with Shaggy Look up the word Shaggy Shaggy long hair shoulder length hair well you know what by that time we have took a Nazarite vow cuz we are before the Lord all the time and we won't do all those other things that we did down here on Earth this is what keeps us clean amen we're taking aarat vow you did when you were born again right to live different to live
