========================================

i want to see you open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart amen to see you high shining in the light of your glory amen pour out your power in love shining in the light of your glory amen pour out your power in love as we sing holy holy holy you are holy holy holy holy holy holy i want to see you amen and amen and amen and amen that's our desire in it to see him and who is he he's the word so we see in the word we're seeing him right and good to see everybody in the house of the lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn to romans 8. romans 8. we'll try to read some from there remember now the bible study this coming saturday six o'clock remember that remember the christmas time together on december the 14th remember just one service now remember you got it right whose brains rolls and who brings this and who brings what just make sure you bring plenty of food because that's what we can decide on roads and all like that but i love the food part don't you that's the greatest of all man just remember that remember now there will not be a service here on december the 24th because that would be wednesday night and we won't be having that service that week so you have a with wednesday night off to be with the family for christmas all right remember then the watch night service will be on the 31st and brother borlavun will be here ministering for us so remember that and just pray that the lord would bless any other announcements i generally miss something if not then all right romans 8 heavenly father we thank you that you are god and you change not and then we can depend upon it we can anchor our hearts our souls or everything into what you say so we believe you and we thank you we ask you to just have your way with us and lord we thank you so much there's just not enough praise in our lips of any way to be able to thank you for saving our souls for guiding us into your love and understanding bringing us into the word of the hour that we may be able to even to hear because it's a blessing just to hear your word but to have an opportunity to be able to believe it talk about it fellowship with it and just let your grace lord be sufficient for every need we love you and we thank you just as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts and our lives on the things that we have need of forgive our sins because that's the main thing lord and keep us in jesus name amen we'll start reading with verse 14 romans 8 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abby father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and as children than ours heirs of god and join ours with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us now it didn't say in him and in this the little sufferings we have you know that we're going through to be revealed in us something gracious and glorious to be revealed in us what's now freddie earnest expectation of the creature waiteth now that's the whole creation part right for the manifestation of the sons of god for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god now remember that scripture all creation is going to follow you right wherever we go what we get all that's going to be taken care of all right now that's that's a glorious thing for we know that the whole creation grown us and travaileth and pained together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to whatnot to wit to understand to understand the redemption of our body you may be seated lord add his blessing to the reading of the word now i was going to continue on into because i wanted to get to uh and talk about it and the lord willing we'll try to do it sunday as to talk about the uh the grace of marriage and divorce and the things you know and uh bringing in a little more of that but i keep coming back to one thing because i know that it's hard to uh um get sometimes our mind our thinking away from what we've been taught you know in our doings and uh you know and we need to you know a lot what we've been taught was good that's no problem to the good part it's just the bad part that took us into the wrong directions and uh you know and then coming to the message of the hour we begin to realize that there is a lot of things that uh you know that you and i are having to deal with uh by being in the message and receiving it and and and i don't mean that wrong because i mean it right it's glorious but uh still we are the only people that i believe in now as much as i can that we're the only people that really know the full plan of redemption all right now you know i believe that i believe that's what it is it's made for this day all right now you can go back into the bible as i say in there the other day and and talk about the things and and you can see there that they believed in one god they believed water baptism they believe predestination they believe no eternal hell they believed all of the of the things and we have to be based upon that and it's not that brother branham come to bring us something different from that all right but to bring what they spoke of right see paul spoke of change in a moment between club and i like trump you know and all he spoke of all of those things but could not see them fulfilled all right but i believe that you and i are the people of god that the end of all things has come upon to worry that somebody's going to see it well why can't we confess we're them you know because you say well it will be one of these days well that means that you don't believe it's here right i mean if you're saying well i believe one of these days but that means you don't believe it's here well let's start saying it's here just like healing we must say that we're healed before we can be healed all right we must say we're saved according to the scriptures before we can be saved all right so then we're going to have to say that we are the bride of christ before we can be that you know one time at the end time the finishing up of all things we're going to have to confess all of the things even to the rapture right and you know and you know how i've always tried to teach that i believe the rapture started on the day of pentecost now you believe what you want to but i believe those people were resurrected sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus raptured up into a height beyond mankind but yet it was still not the sufficient amount to to take the change and bring that to pisces all right because you're gonna have to have a change of the body you're gonna have to have the resurrection and a change according to the scripture before you can talk about a rapture you know going away well i thought we were supposed to be going away in the new birth i thought that removed us from the the world of sin you know and bringing us to a position to word it we can say we've been raptured up well lord i believe the second coming of jesus christ started on the day of pentecost i do i'm just honest i can be because i believe that's why brother branham wouldn't say you know he come along and he said i'm not saying he's coming he's i'm saying he's here well you know what to him might have been the only person in the world but at least it was to him that's right all right but see we're going to have to come to those things that's what i spent all of that series about a positive attitude to get away from the negativism well we don't see nothing going on nobody's got nothing we just sitting around you know just doing this and just dying and that's what we're doing but somebody's gonna have to start confessing it well why can't we say we are right you say well brother dale do you believe that we have the faith of the fathers i confess we do i believe i can prove we do because i believe we have the same revelation that they had not meaning all of us meaning everything but meaning the word of god do you believe the headstone is here i do i believe the headstone was this prophet's message now i say headstone because you gotta have a sold word all right then the word sown into the hearts by the prophet now the quickening power is something else now and it's not my responsibility to try to quicken it i can't do that i wish i could right you know i mean it would be nice if we could do it but we can't do it so god has to quicken it but we're going to have to say it before that it can be done all right now i got just a little part of a thought tonight to cover with you when we get to it in a minute but uh i will i do want to read one thing because the brothers were trying to get it for me sunday and i couldn't pick it up it was the quote that a lot of people you know want to know about and we'll go ahead and just read it right here and then that way uh you know they had it running up and down and i just had to say forget it it was the statement that i had made that i didn't have see i didn't have it in my possession i knew brother branham had made this statement you know but i didn't have it because i had lost it and for some reason i couldn't find it but run up the question on the number one a and uh let's just read what he had to say and then you know let you read it and let you think about what he's saying it was about the uh wrong companion etc all right so let's just let him say it but i want you to read the whole thing because this is what's amazing to me is uh and i don't claim to be uh i just claim to believe what the prophet says because that way we can follow it he said look i'm not asking questions and answers real number 2 64 8 23 paragraph 209 all right i'm not advising you now this was before marriage and divorce was priests right all right now you go back through those questions and answers you find a lot of wonderful nuggets but you find that there was a lot of people back there misunderstood because you know i could call the brother's name but he went around the country saying you know and preaching his own marriage in divorce you know and he you know he had it all figured out and then you get into the soul matings you get into all of those things leave this one go with that one and do this and the other and they're just running like crazy and brother branham hadn't even preached the grace yet or anything you know but yet he'll make some amazing statements that i believe we should consider those statements all right and look what he says i'm not advising you please let me just give you a little scripture now remember he's a prophet when he says scripture he's not saying matthew 28 19 right you know because you'll be looking for the scripture he you he's giving you the correct understanding i believe of the scriptures right i think that was what he was brought for see not to just figure out well we got to put matthew 28 19 right here you know no no all right please please don't don't don't if you're living happy with your husband living happy with your wife please remain that away were you judged for because i told you that don't don't leave them little children without a home and things like that now from that statement is where i speak from when i say paul was dealing with a guy married five times and what's he going to do in his day you can't leave him living with five and get into the new testament part so what did he do go home with one but raise them other kids don't be a sorry slot and say they ain't mine they belong to the devil that's serpent seed no that's where that comes from for me all right it says please remain that way because i told you don't leave them little children right at home and things like that now what kind of a person would you think of that would come in to church here you know and they'd say brother dale i want to get my life straightened up it's okay this we do the best we can do i ain't raising him other kids because they don't belong to me you know what i'd tell him i said don't let that door hit you as you go out because you'll never be a part of this group with that form of an attitude right because they wouldn't be desiring to be a christian you see what the problem with a lot of things are all right god has made restitutions and places for people that that did things wrong you remember jesus said of david when he was in hungary he entered into the temple of god and ate the shoe bread which was which is only lawful for the priest and is found blameless now it doesn't say david you're going to have to go back you can argue the point david never went behind the veil to get to manna separate that shoe bread is different shoe bread was out where the priest ate but nobody couldn't go in and eat it you see where i have to get in that and i have to study that part out to find don't don't put david behind the veil eating the manna you can't do it it won't work out all right see and he's found blameless priests also blame blaspheme the sabbath uh upon the sabbath day and are found blindly because there's certain things they had to do and the greater than the sabbath is here there let's leave it up to god and go ahead and just live the way just just live for christ now let's see there might be a chance of you getting in right now so let's go i'll take his word about a change better than i will all the theologians about their dust saith the lord you know so i'll go ahead don't make two wrongs will never write in one just go on and live the way you are if you're if you're happy together notice where people say well we're not happy i'm sorry you made the bed hard mom used to say that was her favorite saying boy you make the bed hard you will sleep in it okay see if you're happy together you might have the wrong companion see everybody wants to power up they want to find some kind of a thing and this all leads back to soul mating you know and i'm supposed to leave my wife because i don't think we're soul mate and marry this world over here because that's my soul mate and then i'm always my sick my 72 year old is over here and i'm so mating with an 18 year old that that just don't fit right you never see it the other way unless you're a rich old lady all right well now listen two wrongs never made a ride you might have the wrong companion but let me ask you a question i tried to explain it to her the other day about the brother that we all know about that you know put away his wife after having 10 kids but i understood that she told him about it you know before they married or back there but yet see he come along to find out a way we want to use the word anyway we want to use it well i've got the scripture what do you mean you live with a woman now you live with a woman a man and woman lives together 10 years and they got a couple of kids and you know and then they start i don't think you're my mate well you're going back uh my i put it this way now hush you're back in the garden with eve and the beast do what you want to you interpret what i just said because that's what it is you're going back to some form that you're trying to work out things and why would you want to leave that wife and find another one oh i want to marry susie we work together she always smells good and she's always happy and there's never any down and out we just everything is so wonderful go talk to sudy's husband and he might want to swap places with you right my point why would you go along after a while and then want to get rid of a wife or a husband or whatever you're doing do the best you can make the best you can out of it that's right you know come on folks isn't that what he's talking about you might have the wrong companion i'll say this one thing if you got the wrong companion in this wife look in this life i i'm honest you say you're going to take away you're going to interpret i don't believe he was meaning wife i believe he was meaning just like he said one time on the message is your wife worthy of the gospel did you know he said that on the message is your life worthy the gospel go to the message listen he says when is your wife worthy of the gospel all right what's he talking about your life all right come on now listen in this life you'll never have it in the other one all wrongs will be made right oh when i get over i'll find my other half of my soul and oh we can just be joined together let me say it this way all wrongs will be made right when we get over there you remember the whole text of the message we're not going to be concerned about having babies and living in homes and doing things i'll have the right mate when i get there it'll be jesus christ that's my companion and we will prove that in a second by the word but that's my companion that's where people can't get the message in correct order to tie it together all together you know and to make it come out we still got what we've been taught see we've been taught certain things and and we believe those certain things you know well and even after all of the years that we studied about one god you know yourself the devil will still come and put doubts in your mind about this scripture or that scripture or why'd he run around say this or what he said he said one day he said let's all stand together and address the third person in the trinity you remember that now did he ever believe in a trinity no it's your trinity you know let's stand the dress when you want to dress because the trinity you're talking about is one to me would be saying but yet see we we want our ideas and our thoughts to be what we believe mama said grandmama said granddaddy said so-and-so said you know and we want to leave it that because way say well brother dale you just tore down everything i've ever believed no i didn't if anybody tore it down it was a word i didn't have anything to do with it i just stated facts to believe it i believe when we get over there and i'll prove it just in a second with a little illustration i believe when we get over there remember they asked jesus you know about in the resurrection whose wife would this be you know whose husband or what that she would've been married all the time when she gets up there she's gonna have ten husbands or ten wives or what this says or that are you see we're not gonna be concerned he said you do error not knowing the scriptures for in the resurrection is neither male nor female we're all female in the body of christ so when we get there we'll have the right companion but we'll look back and recognize the human life that we lived i play that you know but i don't think i'll be walking down through there with peggy on my arms and walk by you know and we'll be walking along had a wonderful time i could have had that one too i don't think so maybe you do it's all right forgive me for being silly but you'll never forget the illustration i give either all right but now think about it we've been talking about god displaying his attributes or his manifestations you know whatever you want to go through all right the fall brought into being the ability for god to display those attributes those manifestations those things all right he did not make us fall i put these on because people without pharisee you know they've never heard but one message and then they wonder what you're talking about he did not make us fall that would be wrong but he knew if he placed us on free moral agency that we would go wrong all right i mean that's just plain and sensible all right so then by doing that he permitted things to come into being that would allow his attributes to be displayed all right now i told you and i believe it polygamy is not an attribute it is a type be careful using it as an attribute you can say well it goes all the way back up that's right but remember we have some other things to go with it but just keep it in the basis of thinking about that he allowed polygamy to come into being to type christ and the church david with his many wives all right but none of those women could have another man see it was all his wife singular all right and and it would type christ in the church in doing that but here's the point i want you to think on because i got to thinking well i've covered this okay i won't go through that and then when something just keeps coming back okay i'm going to cover it because maybe it's for me all right you just bear with me you remember in the polygamy to show the point that it's not an attribute but it's a type that in polygamy the animals were allowed to go into polygamy all right now the animals see were placed into polygamy all right or permitted whatever your terminologies uh that you'd like to do uh permitted that to happen and uh in the type when it was fulfilled as i was trying to get over sunday when the type back there of of david and many wives et cetera type christ in the church it done away with polygamy because the prophet said polygamy is wrong now all right but you know what it never took away the polygamy in the animal had you ever considered that i tapped it a little bit sunday but if you considered it why did it not take away the animal kingdom because you know we look at the animals and and and we know that they don't have no soul you know and doings but remember that that animal now that animal was used in the fall now i'm quoting from page 102 uh church age book ephesians church age huh that animal was used in the fall and by being used see brother brown said then the animal would be the atonement all right so then the animals were killed etc but they could not take away sin so they could only type the coming messiah all right but yet still they could cover sin until a time would come now to me that's a wonderful thing to think about that had the animal not been used he would have not made them involved in the atonement right i mean is that sensible i mean he wouldn't just walk out there and say hey sorry i'm going to take your life no there was a connection between the animal and the mankind which was the beast which was to fall in the natural right so then the connection was there and until this day and until we get into millennium because i went up that far with it you're going to future home that's fine because but i just given the quote where the prophet stop he said in the millennium it'll still be one jesus christ a many member body but that will be one body that's beautiful to me one body to be dealt with made up of millions of millions of millions of people right so then um i search for words and i'm a human so the signs of the polygamy will have to stay with mankind until the time of the finish in and the prophet brought it i said in the millennium he said it would be david with that all right now think about it and i want you to read the scripture with me so go ahead brother i don't know who's on the pole tonight my lord them boys running yourself back out yeah all right pull up number pull up the scripture we read in romans 8. you know i love it when they can they they turning it over these kids back there and letting them run this thing and and man that's wonderful because i want them to get involved and have their part and things like that and it's really a great thing all right now they keep pointing back our wave and hey there oh my that's richard back here now i got the picture of the ugly face i mean i saw him in the mirror uh but look at romans let's let's think about this animal because that's what i want you to think about my point has been for four or five services why is polygamy still after you've come to the fact of polygamy being wrong under the new testament because you've come to christ in the church back to one male one female all right now remember if you're going back to the beginning then you're going to have to go back further than one male and one female you better put them back together as adam was now is that going to be hard to think on because if you don't put them back to where adam and eve was you've got two people and you're going to be hard to deal with some things all right so listen he talks about us and the children the inheritance and glorified together and wrote it on up said it won't be wrecking the suffering you know compared with that to come all right pull back down just to her because we want to see for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god creatures creation right that's animals and it's the world right the world is a creation all right see now everything's involved all right now since far the creature was made subject to vanity come on he was put under the curse now i i know the message so don't run me off on curse i know what brother brown said he didn't even curse adam he didn't curse he he cursed the earth i know that but just remember the word curse we'll read it in a minute you're still under sin curse all right so then you can argue see that's where people get in their minds and nowadays especially they've got this great computerized systems that whenever you say something they can roll out the quotes well okay but just don't roll too far you have rolled out on the end of your limb a few times and got cut off okay for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope do you realize my point this is what i've been trying to find words for quite a while that if you do not hold polygamy in this day not by the human race now everybody understand me i've been through that but the sign of polygamy in the animal kingdom then how are you going to bring christ in his pride over in there to be a many-membered body maybe you never considered that i'm talking about the animal all right see the creature was made subject to man not willingly he didn't want to do that you remember satan entered the beast come on but by reason of him who has subjected to simon hope god put him in there put him into a place and they have to depend upon what he does right because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god okay for we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now but think about that animal satan used that animal to achieve his goal to enter the human race all right and then by using that animal then god said okay animal you'll be the atonement you'll have your part to do and now if i'm not quoting wrong it seemed like it was rabbi richmond was talking about it and it really thrilled my soul to think about the wording that he used whether or not it was you know i believed it but he said when that animal was laid down before god he said it was an act of love being displayed and i thought about that i mean that little lamb it can't do a thing you know no defense but it just lays down and gives us life you know yeah that's something to me that animal is going to be in heaven that's my personal opinion okay i don't say all i'm going to be there but them animals that with a sacrifice is going to be there it's going to be a wonderful place okay but think about it now so the animal was put in a conditional situation never what words you want to use to hold over even after you had come to the new birth you know it would have something to do even after the new birth is achieved you know into the individual because the animal has no soul he can't deal that away so he's not dealing in salvation but he will be dealing in the basis of redemption see he can be brought back in the redemptive plan all right now he says even and went on to that we grown within ourselves so don't forget that you know we're getting older we're getting more limited we're sicker we're problems running our way everything's going wrong and we we come to a basis that we're groaning if you're not groaning wanting to get out of here i'll give you a few more years you'll catch up i feel i i i do peggy my wife gets on to me all the time why the world you go to the doctor so she went the other day she said he won't tell you what's wrong with him and doctor he just looked at her i said because my confession is i'm healed and i hate to say i'm sick you know so i finally developed and say okay doc i'm wonderful i feel good but help is sinus problem that's killing me you know all right but you see i hate to make a negative confession cause i'm healed amen amen i want it to be positive i want it to be something that god can look down and say well at least he's saying it you know now i can say it back but now listen i i thought i'd done a job of doing it sunday to prove that polygamy is wrong today because that we come to the type of christ in the church and we come to the basis of being to work that it would be back again like it was in the garden of the you know one man and one woman and that's why we gave the scriptures where he says you know to uh you know there's neither male or female and and paul said it and they become one flesh all right now in that we should have a conception of knowing that we are not genetic dynamically we don't have the same dna me and my wife don't have the same dna uh in that we're two people but in christ man and his wife becomes the wonderful type paul speaks over the great mystery of christ in his church all right so then a real true wife and husband types christ in the church so you don't need no more typing in mankind now i hope you follow my point see by the new birth that came on the day of pentecost you have it back now i'll read right here what the prophet said back like it should have been all right and now you're not using polygamy as being okay you may have thought in some of the words that i've used to the prophet coming down where it says he she can't he can i made my place made myself plain that he can't unless he has a biblical reason it's not just for any calls that the pharisees had it jesus straightened that out he said you go back to the beginning you find there's one man and one woman now you come back and tell me about it you come and tell me what something is different than what i've told you all right but man and his wife is type of christ in the church since the day of pentecost because that's where you started the multiple member body of the lord jesus christ all right see then typing christ in the church bringing it to a place that it's a wonderful position that you don't need the polygamists see somebody come along you know when you i'm just hear preachers oh that's a wonderful house through i said look at that look i thought if you don't believe in polygamy look out there in the yard there's a rooster and a bunch of hens well now where does that straighten up that prostitution went up last year does that mean it's of god you say who you quoting i'm quoting brother brown right you remember him saying that so you think something's right just because of this way do you matter he said prostitution went up last year see they don't that don't make it come out right the word is what's right all right now but think about it see once you receive that new birth it puts your soul eternal all right right now all right now we know there's growth developments we know that goes on into adoption that's not the point i'm trying to get out tonight it's a point for us to think about that if we can think about that new birth making our soul eternal but here's where our problem is we hold over the old organized religions ways and thoughts that we think that well the new birth took care of that well i got a good hammer in the nail okay why didn't your new birth take care of the polygamy in the animal kingdom scratch your head it didn't take care of it it's still here today so we got to divide between the animal and the human right and see that the animal is still under that conditional situation but the human being by the new birth is not all right see there's no salvation for an animal you know what i mean there's no new birth it's not for him he doesn't have a soul so he's going to have to be brought into being in the correct order as we read some way to restore that animal back like it was because the new bird take care of that polygamy in the human race but it does not take care of the polygamy in the animal rights you've got to admit it's still out there and you've got to admit that god is still using it but he's not using it in the human race right i know i get hard on people and everything else and i'm sorry i've been accused of being aggravated and hateful lately i am i'm aggravated and hateful and upset with you and me i said you and me do i want to start on the front row and name all of you all right good to see folks we either going to get out of here or we go into the grave now i only know one way of getting out of here and i don't think it's running out of time you know i think it's the revealed word that has to be made and brought forth but now remember the animal he is not included in any form of uh uh and i know you got atonements made by animals for animals i know that in the bible so don't run off with me all right but see he has no way to be redeemed you know what he's waiting on you and i oh you can make an atonement for the donkey you can make you got all of those things in the bible that's what i said you know i have read a little bit but i'm just making the point that that animal he's going to have to depend on something else to take place and we are that that has to take place that's right because that's what we just read in the bible he didn't want to be put in that place but he was put in that place because of us right he made the atonement for us until the day of pentecost came the new birth and since then you don't offer the animal right why put another why is this you don't offer the animal today because christ was our atonement all right then christ is my husband in polygamy be wrong today but see we know that that we we're leaving it and let that be but that animal he has no ability no way that he can come back outside of the pride of jesus christ because even the atonement that was made at calvary didn't take away the polygamy in the animals that's right you've got to agree or do you shake head no yes or up and down or what you're going to do you go ahead you got to know it's true all right see then by that new birth we see by the what i've just proven unto you whether you think it's proved or whatever that the new birth cannot do away with your marital problems the new work don't do it because it only deals with the soul all right had that new birth on the day of pentecost come into body spirit soul then it'd all been finished and they'd walked off the earth and we wouldn't be part of it right but you see it had to wait until somebody could come to the right understanding all right but he permitted the polygamy until the time all right now so then when it comes down to the animal the animal is still now listen very carefully the animal is still under the curse remember how you want to say the words you put them together i don't have the education i know what brother brown said he didn't curse even he didn't curse adam he cursed the earth and all i know that but remember the animal come out of the earth are you right with me this body come out of the earth so we're going to have to deal with this earth and until we can bring this earth back into the correct position and according to what i've read of romans 8 it would have to be in the days of the manifestation of the sons of god all right and it would have to be in this time that the earth has already we'll read a little while it's done went through justification in the days of noah the earth has went through sanctification in the days of you know the blood but it's to receive a fiery baptism which it hasn't received right right and we'll read over and then we'll come back so then our bodies our bodies justification works in the repentance part but it starts a work back out into the body you agree sanctification works back through the body of the cleansings and the things and the baptism of the holy ghost is the new birth in the soul to make that soul eternal all right now in doing that see you would no longer need polygamy because you've come to the correct order that jesus said in matthew 19 4 where it says made a male and a female as one flesh all right god is the only one that's eternal all right then the new birth makes each and every one of us heirs join ours we read born again christian makes your soul eternal but it doesn't make your body eternal it doesn't make your spirit eternal we got sense enough to know that all right well it don't bother me when you you believe that there was law you won't do i'm looking at you and you're looking at me so we don't have a problem we just know what the whole thing is what the best it is is a new birth inside of a person through justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost makes us soul eternal and it did not convert that body it begins to bring the body under subjection to the one that's within oh when i got the new birth i'll just set free from everything yeah we'll see you at the tribulation all right see the new birth places the soul of mankind back like it should have been in the beginning you believe that put it back just like it should have been in the beginning all right now let's just read brother branham it's way on over but i want to make sure to get this work he'll come in line so go ahead and pick up number one there not one a now pick up number one this is from the spoken word is original seed priest in 62 318 all of god's sons must be the same yes sir to be born of the word and spirit brings us back to the spoken word again like in john 3. what's that you must be born again right you know word and spirit and see to be born of the water and the spirit what does it do then it brings you right back again unto the place of where you should have been at the beginning now is that straight enough i'll say this one thing excuse me that's the reason christ died to bring us back again to were sons of god the new birth word and spirit brings us back just like we should have been you know or were in the beginning all right now hold on to that point go over to 2 8 take an offspring word to regional c and look what your prophet had to cite paragraph 2 16 16-18 well that's the same thing from predestination you were supposed to be here in the right way at the beginning but being that you come the way you did you're subject to the fall but being that you're predestinated you hear the word it brings you right back where you were predestinated amen and watch him never saw that before something opened up didn't it from predestination to a prophet of what if we can be born of the word and spirit the new birth it brings our soul back to where we're predestinated brings you right what makes you believe the word of god and turn down these other things is because you were there is something in you way back you under you know you're supposed to live forever are you following me so your prophet says that the new birth makes the soul back in the same position than it was in the beginning what beginning is he affirmed when he made them male and female now we're going to get touchy for a second so swallow and listen but that new birth is not in the body it's not in the spirit it's in the soul all right now there's only one form of eternal life right and that's god's own life right all right so we receive that by the new birth and brother branham says it makes me and god together what did he say one time he'll say it's persons he'll use it like that together as one she realized by the new birth they came on the day of pentecost i go all the way back there see to bring every born-again believer it makes that soul just as eternal as it'll ever be all right now as i said a moment ago if you try to bring adam and eve and stand them side by side be careful you're doing okay but you've got to go one more step because if you leave them side by side you don't have paul's understanding of the man and the wife being one did you follow it you keep them side by side and you do not have paul's understanding of christ in the church because paul's understanding of christ in the church was christ in the church not two people it's christ in you the hope of glory all right so then by that new birth see it put a man in a woman back like it should have been in the beginning which was then when they was in adam see you stopped with me a minute ago so now you're gonna have to get off and unhook and pull back a little more see adam and eve brother branham says would you like to quote that he was in adam and theophany do you need that quote i'd be glad to get it for you eve was in adam and theophany see there's where we gotta lock down and get away from all of that that we've got it so much of yonder all of this is up there and all of these things you know and just sat down and think i know what paul said he said we if this earthly tabernacle were that's right which means the question will part to you and not done until it is we're dissolved we have one waiting i know the quotes from brother branham said right over there we go right over there he went with her and what did he see the angel of the lord said souls under the altar he now no problem saying that he saw those people in theophany we see we still got that mind thought of theophany up yonder well now i want to ask you one question i know questions gender strife all right how many eternal lives are they if you have the new birth you have eternal life right in here right and then you have eternal life up there because the bible says we haven't won eternally in the heavens that's the bible but now do you have two eternal lives simple question all right so we said on page 80 of the hebrew book your soul is your theophany and i know he uses the word theophany for a sinner because the word theophany means a body of deity or body for deity whatever you want to bring it because that's the the word theophany all right and he'll refer to a sinner and you know he i gave you the quote a couple of weeks ago where he went preach to those people that were souls in prison theophany jesus in theophany went to them in theophany they were sinners that were not able to come out right because it means a body you you got to go somewhere when you leave here but now when you use the word eternal right you got an entirely different then they sinner don't have eternal life come on we got away from that eternal hells you know i hope we did we'd listen to it last night where brother brown said that's one thing i got to drive down he said we just don't believe that no more you know about hell being eternal see you'd have to have eternal life to live in hell if you if hell is eternal that's sensible but those people were in their souls amen what were they you know he could see him jesus evidently good he talked to him he preached to him but he couldn't bring him out why because they were not born again and even the ones he picked up which were the old testament saints he had to pick them up into a position to even speak about doing it but see what i like is in genesis 1 this is wade's favorite topic 126-27 let us make man in our own image page 80 of the hebrew book brought around said said that what man did he make he said he made a spiritual man he said now he didn't make you know all man in other words i'm paraphrasing it because you see those that's in hell that that has nothing to do with eternal life now brother brown said we'd all be better off if we believed in predestination unto no if i reuse the word wrong forgive me but he would say predestination under regeneration or he said if we believe even in predestination under reprobation you remember that in the church facebook see because there's a lot of people that are predestinated by the full knowledge of god not that he made anything but by the foreknowledge of god they will never be there all right so they predestinated under reparation but there are people who will be born again and they're predestinated under regeneration there's people predestinated like the jews the fifth seal the different ones like that that are not predestinated as far as a redemptional form here but will receive eternal life somewhere so they have a predestination but it's all god's foreknowledge keep it that way we don't have to worry about it we're back to where he said said bring us back like it was in the beginning where we were predestinated right all right so then being in that place see then there's only one soul that was created in genesis 1 26-27 he said not man not a man let's see i didn't give them this one demonology priesthood 53 608 physical realm but your souls were made up before the foundation of the world when god created man in his own image spirit of man not a man in his own image but man in his own image he didn't make every man in his own image they are in the bases that they're creators there are supernaturals or all kinds of things like that but he didn't make but one man genesis 1 26. now you want to argue the point we can go through a lot of prophet's message because he said genesis 1 26 spiritual man first physical man second now do you want to believe that there was more than one atom created in the garden there was one man by himself that's right inside of him was a woman amen but they had the same theophany eve never had her own being until she was removed from adam that's right you agree oh yeah there wasn't two souls running around in there because that's that old doctor in backyard a long time ago you know see adam and eve was a sign now you say well all right here comes the nail on the day of pentecost there was only one soul that came into being right there was 120 in the upper room but every one of them received the same soul the soul of god which is eternal life so now there's only one eternal soul only one eternal soul can't be many eternal souls come on you want to keep it right because when we get over there it'll be jesus with a many-membered body but you know what all of that body is one soul one eternal life that's what he should we should have been in the beginning but you can only go back as jesus said back to the beginning so he says you got to go back to a point so he goes back to a point jesus does that in the beginning he made them male and female right in the beginning he made them male and female but then he made them a man and a woman right but that man and that woman both was only one person when he failed she got the name eve she never got that name to start with that was not her original name her name was adam when she failed she got the name eve which means the mother of all living all right now are you listening see your animal could not be involved in that your animal could not be involved in the genesis 1 26 and 27 man whatever you want to thank would done whatever you want to thank or how many million you think was what or whatever you want to do with it you can't put the animal there because you have no soul so in the animal kingdom polygamy is still here because we're not through typing christ in the church yet now hold on until that life member comes into the body of christ your body of christ is not complete so if there's one sitting here tonight that's not born again we're waiting on you not sitting down goofing off waiting but yeah and we're trying to find everybody trying to find that life soul right well i'm trying to find that nice person that would like to die to themselves and get born again and let jesus christ come and live inside of them and it'd be you and god together as persons your prophet would say how else can you make statements what else can you do you're talking in a human realm of languages but i hope you understand what i'm getting at see it was one man and one woman right but before then it was not one man and one woman it was one man that was male and female now not if they were filming these things that's what everybody wants to put some kind of adam would he'd walk around a little while and he'd say i don't know what you're saying and once you're straightened yeah you know because i'm acting like a woman now that's silly you say well you're silly i agree with you it's not feminist like that when he took the feminist part out of adam was adam a pervert no the only thing that was taken out of adam listen was his rib to get a flesh right right to be brought into being right and then god put into eve the feminist part right not having to take it out of adam but giving her her own being her own doings like they say you know they say the woman thinks with right-hand side of the brain so you're always in your right mind we mean we use the left-hand side that's what science says so you're in your right mind we got it all messed up but just remember the only difference between a man and a woman in the garden in the garden was when they were separated you following me then he made two people right and i've always taught you and i believe it adam you're gonna have to think a little here because when adam was physically created he was standing as the prophet said with his feet in the dirt that he came from and he said and god breathed into his nostrils and he became a living soul why does it stated exactly like that because if god put his own soul into adam without it being any connection to adam that would have been jesus come on so you better give adam a body a spirit and a soul as a human mortal yeah if i'm wrong show me because if he'd just been body and spirit and god put his own life in there that would have been the first adam which would have been christ i'll give you something to think i'm going but you see he created him body spirit and soul and he's standing there then god breathed his own breath of life into him well all he done is reached over and got eve and just pulled her out of adam and made a body and he gave her a spirit and a soul come on so she's body spirit and soul just like adam then he puts eternal life which was his life into adam and eve you see if i didn't believe it that way i preached eve didn't have nothing to start with i don't believe it i'm always wondering why some preachers didn't come along preach it that way but eve didn't have nothing to start with eve was a mortal human being that's how she could fall she couldn't fault his soul with her soul being eternal in the basis of staying with the theophany that was in adam to start with so she had to be separated give her a body spirit and soul let her stand there adam's already been body spirit and soul god breathed into his nostrils so what was the problem with him breathing in the aids nostrils and her becoming a living soul but you see that was the beginning of the creation remember now we got all night you remember the beginning of the creation is different from the everything else he don't create nothing wrong to start with so he's the beginning of the creation of god so then that's got to be right to start with so the beginning has got to be the perfect point that's why he won't sit back not just adam and eve standing one side by side that cannot type christ in the church get you and i out of the way and let's see christ standing in a body that's right that's why i didn't agree with him when i brought it out i tried my best to explain to the brothers talking about the parousia or parasia which means the presence of god i tried my best to explain that to him so listen brother i don't want god's tanning was tied to me oh you think i i wish he walked with me all the time i walk with him and i talk with him just remember he was walking in the garden when adam and eve done what they done so now go play your games i don't want him standing beside of me i want him inside of me because if he's inside of me i cannot be destroyed am i right he couldn't even destroy sarah because he was so much of adam i mean abraham right why can't we see what redemption is that's right everybody's always wanted to try to prove we back there i thought redemption was to take place here i didn't think it was supposed to take me back before the world i thought it was supposed to bring me to where i should have been had there been no fall come on you can predestinate yourself out of existence and don't even realize it i want to go back where i was well then if you go back where you was that was before the foundation of the world and you're only in the mind of god now that's what your prophet had to say so go ahead you see that's why i make those planes blunt plain i'm tired right not tired physically i'm tired of the foolishness that satan has packed upon the people in their minds you don't understand what i mean if you're going to go back where you come from you go clean out of existence as a human being whatever you would be back there you'd have no recognition of a human being and that would not be god's plan and purpose right that would not be his attributes on display he couldn't display his attributes before the world were you agreeing he had to let man come into the fall to display the attributes let me stay over here i don't want to go back now because i go out of existence you say well i don't understand you i agree i don't understand myself but i know one thing for sure if that statement ain't right i want you to explain it to me well what it was brother there back for the world it was just this great big thing and we were all up there having a wonderful time and we would just all shout and glory hallelujah and we decided to come to earth that is a mormon doctrine i don't know against the mormons but that's their doctrine that we was up in heaven with father and we decided to come to earth and be lost the worst part of it was the devil wanted to save us all that's the mormon doctrine the devil wanted to save every person but said jesus come along with the idea to save so many and father took jesus's idea come on i've talked to with the high ranks because i wouldn't make the statement if i didn't i talked with the guy that's got the little drawing things but on his shorts if you think i don't know what i'm talking about ever what that little thing's got to pee in the middle and draw the pen around signal the eternal life but listen i don't want to go that way and i don't want to go that way i want to be what i'm supposed to be right here now and sitting here in this situation even though it's a falling point but yet happy because of knowing what my father is doing do i need to go back and preach again the prophet said to be born the word and spirit takes you back like you should have been in the beginning you realize that soul is just as eternal tonight if you have eternal life just as eternal as god is because it's god's own life that's right yeah but you just don't leave enough of us to be anything sorry that's our problem may i say this our problem is we want to be some you just don't make us anything well i think i stand behind millions of true christians to make this statement the fox book of martyrs they took them out and burned them killed them burn them cooked them done everything in the book and you know all they wanted was for christ to live in them and not nothing of their own not nothing of their own i'm gonna say this and then back off we'll get to it sunday see people want the grace of marriage and divorce but remember it's only for your past why don't you accept what god has given you and forget about trying to do anything else right that's the answer right there what's wrong what if i'm free i got it right okay make a little more all creation is groaning let's go to number seven just for a minute because we got to quit the god of this evil age paragraph 187 through 189 and look what he says but the greatest of all healings they talk about healings and deliverance if you heal their physical body from cancer tb pneumonia except they'll get sick again no doubt if they live very long for their body is still under sin the curse but let them get the real divine healing the healing of the soul which makes a new creature passes from death into life and then waiting in these old tabernacles for the redemption of the body after the soul has been redeemed right granted lord all right read fast number eight revelations chapter 5 61 and look where he's reading from he's reading from romans 8. the whole creation is droning waiting for the adoption to it the redemption of our bodies to understand the redemption of our bodies to it means to understand to come to a place do you see it all creation is groaning said paul everything's groaning look at the trees how they struggle look at the flowers how they struggle for life just for the frost to tear them down look at the trees how they struggle to hold their branches out to sing glories unto god see everything all nature all animals all birds how he flies from the enemy quickly and gets away everything groaning and we ourselves said paul we've grown too with them for we are waiting for the redemption of our body but i was took care of when i got born again well i'm sorry i just blowed some bubbles i guess 105. but now now they did all those years until now now we have the earnest of our inheritance look at it oh my what do we have we have the evidence that god lives we have the evidence that god is with us we have the evidence that god has not forsaken us that we are he is and he is ours because we in our bodies we now tabernacle the holy spirit of god that cries out now thy father and there's nothing can ever take that away we are anchored in christ now the trees does not have it nature does not have it but yet we are still groaning you understand what i mean all the time i spent nature can't be born again they can't be done something's got to happen the trees does not have it nature don't have it but yet we're still groaning with them because with them because as yet we haven't received the fullness of our adoption but we have the earnest of it that we have picked up from the things of the world and now become sons and daughters of god what kind of people should we be oh my when we think of that think of it now we have the earnest our spirits groaning for the full adoption but now we have the earnest of it and as as we receive the holy spirit it is the earnest of our complete adoption our complete salvation oh how beautiful i just love that all right we are waiting for the fullness of adoption this will take place when at the first resurrection that's when our bodies will be changed from these vile creatures that we are and we'll have a body like unto his own glorious body far we shall see him as he is and we will be like him when he appears we appear in his likeness we will have a body like he is a glorious glorified body and all the trials and struggles of life will fade off into a little mist and blow away to never be no more and these earthly tabernacles which we have which we now grown in we're waiting for that earnest that earnest for the salvation fully in his fullness to come but now in these tabernacles of clay we have something that tells us that we have raised up so far amen what is the earnest it's a little down payment it holds us think about him think about the great understanding let me see if i can find one more there's one more i wanted to read because it's taken from the seal book you may have left that off in there in the office nope nope didn't lose it go back drop back to five excuse me because he's reading from waiting for the adoption of our you know redemption of our body adoption this is taken from the breach uh 63 progress 75 through 77 then we'll go to 365 on down on my mind don't that make us old folks feel good it ought make us all feel good waiting for this hour we understand this will take place at the first resurrection see nature is groaning we are groaning everything is groaning because we realize there's something not right and the only way you can groan and wait for it is to is because that you have been because there has been new life come in here that speaks of a new world all right go on now to the next one 367 357 excuse me he was this is taken from the still on the the this is on the future home all right all right yeah all right that was a breach here's a future home he was the beginning of the creation of god see and then that blood of god that there by that germ when it was shed at calvary dropped back upon the earth what for to redeem the earth now it's been justified it's been sanctified called claimed and now it's to receive its baptism of fire and be cleansed for jesus and his bride now you are these other parts that's drawn out of this earth now come on the earth you're a part of the earth your body your soul is a part of god an attribute of god displayed here on earth in a body the body is to be redeemed right okay the soul is redeemed because it was in sin god come down by process of justification case of baptism of the holy ghost and redeemed your soul and you being part of the earth it's redeemed by it by your new birth come on i've got one in here in case i miss it where he says your redemption is already paid for everything's paid for it's not something to wait in the last days there's got to be something come back and be paid for it was paid for at calvary okay because i missed that and you being part of the earthly redeemed you're in the process now it's growing on your body was justified under noah's baptism amen in your flesh when it dropped upon there and the earth is to be cleansed by fire the place where you live with the baptism of the holy ghost a dwelling place for christ and his bride the new jerusalem let's see that on yeah your body is being redeemed to me that's what this statue of a perfect man is about it's in the inner man but it's working back out through the outer man to try to bring us to a place of full redemption you know and uh in doing it the whole world's waiting on you and i that can't be a world brought into a redemptive form unless this world here is first brought into that form then when this world is brought into that form i hope you're following me the animals will come because they also come out of this earth and this world will come brother branham on the future home he talks about he said they're on the river jordan where it come down on him he said i've redeemed this part of the earth and from this part of the earth i'll redeem the rest of it god done it at calvary we know that but there was mystery secrets that were left and one of those is the full understanding of adoption to finish with the redemption of these bodies then it'll all be over with right it'd be a wonderful place a wonderful time when we all get there in the way we're supposed to be amen there's no disgrace by dying and going by the grave sister cleda used to say she's i just get to beat you up yeah see because you go by the grave i'm going to raise for you too so i'm just going to get ahead of you and if you'll notice the point i try to make it but random never went to as much in the change of the body as he took the adoption to the resurrection you notice that you follow it if you don't read the message you know why because if they can be a resurrection you ain't got to worry about nothing now if they can be a resurrection you ain't got to worry about these rapture change i'm interested in the resurrection that's why downstairs come on musicians downstairs these pictures are the ones that are pine stone i don't know what to look like because when somebody comes in and i say yeah there well that's brother tatum and a little sister tatum you know see i don't know what to look like because i believe they'll be here then the bible says that we which are alive and remain shall be what changed and then we're caught up right everybody wants to caught up caught up i want the resurrection this comes next ever how you think it will come or what you think about just remember the next thing is the resurrection but we're so good at quoting brother branham until i remember he made the statement one time like this and we're so carnal he said if i don't see you anymore i'll see you in the millennium you remember that statement well according to that the millennium's the next thing well that's not exactly right because there's got to be a resurrection a change a tribulation you know a lot of things we see but i just told you what he said um judas went and hung himself you go do likewise i just told you what he said see you can quote all day long but i love it and i've got it in my bible here somewhere that brother branham gives an order and i wrote it down i remember this years ago he gave an order he said the next is the rapture tribulation you know to the jews in in armageddon and he said then the millennium and then gog and magog and then future home well i don't care what he says if he says the next time i see you i'll see you in the tribulation ain't no rapture took place yet so that ain't the next thing you see what we can do we can quote ourselves to death that's why those pharisees couldn't understand jesus especially nicodemus now you tell me that man didn't know a lot and you tell me like i told you here a few weeks ago you think that's a five-minute sermon right there i believe jesus and nicodemus are probably together for half a day or more you can argue all you want to watch what you believe it ain't going to change that part to me because he didn't just sit down and say you must be born again they they probably talked about the scriptures the great things that was in the scriptures and nicodemus would agree with every bit of it even the coming messiah you know on the things but then we said okay you must be born again oh you got in something i never know i don't know about him but he couldn't understand it do we understand it what do we got 138 inspirations just hand together sorry being just a little bit late tonight but uh i wanted to get that point about the animals oh nothing less it ties into the next jesus blood and righteousness why don't i trust the sweetest anybody have a need sinking sin i believe in divine healing and i believe anchor holds within the veil on christ the solid rock all other grounded for adoption somebody's gonna do it why can't we say we are don't let me stand in the way of somebody that can you remember that i can't stand that if you want to aggravate me at all just be down and out why can't we be happy and joyous jesus said brother pray why can't we believe that away and get away from our petty little feelings you know well just down and out if you if you had everything i had you'd be down and out too wowsy wowsy woo and then what brother forney says you never get nowhere with those wowzy that is wowzies me greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world satan's like seeking whom he may devour the bible tells us so many souls have been his prayer to fall in some wake up but god has promised jesus greater is he that is in me than he that is um sister monica called did the reason they wouldn't hear that they were sick so let's just believe and ask the lord to take care of all things aren't our little sister standing in for him so let's believe father we
