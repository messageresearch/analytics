[8:52] amen
[8:59] amen you have your bibles
[9:02] turn with me to revelations chapter
[9:04] three
[9:06] stand for the reading of the word
[9:10] i thought maybe tonight and maybe
[9:12] brother joe he didn't pressure me but he
[9:14] thought well maybe
[9:15] you know if you didn't have anything
[9:17] else you should think about this so
[9:20] well it just seemed it seemed like i
[9:23] could be good
[9:26] it's what the lord would have for us but
[9:28] um
[9:30] as as many of you may know you maybe
[9:32] have the book on your shelf
[9:34] um uh about oh five or six years ago i
[9:38] started
[9:39] i had always wanted to write a
[9:41] curriculum
[9:42] using the church age book is the
[9:43] textbook so you would read the church
[9:45] age book and then you could answer
[9:47] questions and
[9:48] activities or whatever and maybe just a
[9:50] little bit of a explanation
[9:52] and you get an assignment how many pages
[9:54] you should read and this is one of the
[9:56] first churches that bought
[9:58] uh those books that i completed what i
[10:00] what i had really originally started
[10:02] doing was
[10:03] i was teaching sunday school to the
[10:04] teenage class at the branham tabernacle
[10:06] and
[10:07] i thought okay i had taught my way
[10:08] through genesis and i thought well i'm
[10:09] going to teach my way through
[10:10] revelations now
[10:12] and um so that's pretty much church ages
[10:14] right there first three chapters so i
[10:16] thought well we'll start here and i've
[10:18] always wanted to do this so what i'm
[10:19] going to do is
[10:20] i'm going to write my lessons for my
[10:22] students
[10:24] in such a way that hopefully when i'm
[10:25] done i can just grab all these lessons
[10:27] and throw them in a book and
[10:28] everybody else can can benefit and the
[10:30] book can sit on people's shelves
[10:32] and they can leave them on the shelves
[10:33] and never actually do the lessons but
[10:35] i'm not bitter but
[10:38] anyway but my intention was that people
[10:41] would read the church age book
[10:43] because it changed my life i it it
[10:45] helped me in my walk with the lord i
[10:47] after i read the church age book i found
[10:49] myself sitting there as i was reading
[10:51] going oh yeah that's why i believe that
[10:52] like i
[10:53] i i how did i knew that
[10:57] but i certainly couldn't have explained
[10:59] it but now at least i've
[11:00] read somebody that did explain why i
[11:02] believe that like it makes sense to me
[11:04] now and
[11:04] and it just really changed my
[11:05] understanding and it changed my walk so
[11:07] i really want everyone to experience
[11:09] that and so but i recognize that you
[11:11] know
[11:12] um you get the church age book and some
[11:14] of us aren't really great readers
[11:17] i like to read but i'm i'm weird i guess
[11:20] but you know it's this thick
[11:21] it's 350 some pages i think it is or
[11:23] something like that and
[11:24] some people look at that and then they
[11:25] see big words like gloss alia and they
[11:28] go
[11:28] and not reading that book and and
[11:32] so i figured well what we need to do is
[11:34] we need to we need to do it just like
[11:35] you'd eat an elephant does anybody know
[11:37] how you eat an elephant
[11:39] one bite at a time so well can you read
[11:41] five pages okay here's a lesson where
[11:42] you read five pages or ten pages
[11:44] can you do that yeah okay we'll just do
[11:46] that 75 times over the next
[11:48] year two years whatever and then you
[11:50] will have read the church age book so
[11:51] that's
[11:52] really what i had tried to do i'm now in
[11:54] the process of
[11:56] of recording video lessons just like a
[11:58] sunday school lesson for each
[12:00] um chapter each lesson that
[12:03] if you you guys are are good here you
[12:06] got plenty of people who can teach and
[12:07] things like that but
[12:08] if there were a church that needed
[12:12] you know maybe didn't have a teacher
[12:13] that was qualified for a teenage class
[12:15] they could take this and try to keep it
[12:16] below 30 minutes so
[12:18] teacher can do some introductions hit
[12:20] the video and
[12:22] you know there's your lesson and okay
[12:23] here's your here's you got your books
[12:25] and so
[12:26] go home and read your lesson and answer
[12:28] the questions and we'll come back on the
[12:29] next one so
[12:30] that's that's the plan that's what what
[12:32] i'm working on but i just thought
[12:34] maybe it's kind of neat you guys you
[12:35] guys bought these books and so i thought
[12:37] well maybe
[12:38] it'd be cool to have to just do a lesson
[12:41] together and so this is i just finished
[12:43] this is the last lesson i preached at
[12:45] our church because we've been going
[12:46] through
[12:46] uh as a church together well the six of
[12:48] us have but the whole church is going
[12:50] through it it's just six people are
[12:51] actually
[12:52] doing the lessons but don't worry that
[12:54] doesn't hurt an author or anything like
[12:55] that but
[12:57] but for all that work and tears and
[13:00] anyway you should just read the church
[13:02] age book
[13:04] amen so anyway i thought well how nice
[13:06] this would this would kind of be we
[13:07] could
[13:08] he's about to hand me some hankies so
[13:11] i first thought well we can we can um we
[13:14] can go through a lesson this would be
[13:15] the introduction to the philadelphian
[13:17] church age i thought it was a good
[13:18] lesson when we
[13:19] when we did it at the at the church and
[13:21] i know you guys have been
[13:22] um going through the revelation series
[13:25] um and many of the quotes are out of
[13:27] um the philadelphia church age on this
[13:29] lesson usually i take them out of the
[13:30] church age book this one i just
[13:31] particularly want to happen to take them
[13:32] mostly out of the message when he
[13:33] preached
[13:34] it but anyway you're standing we should
[13:35] read the scripture and then i'll let you
[13:36] sit
[13:37] so revelations chapter 3 verses 7
[13:40] through 13
[13:41] is the is the word to the philadelphian
[13:44] age unto the angel of the church in
[13:45] philadelphia right these things
[13:47] saith he that is holy he that is true he
[13:50] that hath the key of david
[13:51] he that openeth and no man shutteth and
[13:53] shouteth in no man openeth
[13:55] i know thy works behold i have set
[13:57] before thee an open door
[13:59] no man can shut it for thou hast a
[14:01] little strength
[14:03] has kept my word and has not denied my
[14:04] name behold i will make of them
[14:07] i will make them of the synagogue of
[14:09] satan which say they are jews and are
[14:11] not
[14:11] but do lie behold i will make them to
[14:14] come and worship before thy feet
[14:16] and to know that i have loved thee
[14:20] that's a scripture because thou has kept
[14:23] the word of my patience i also will keep
[14:25] thee from the hour of temptation which
[14:27] shall come upon all the world
[14:29] to try them that dwell upon the earth
[14:33] behold i come quickly hold that fast
[14:36] which thou hast
[14:37] that no man take thy crown him that
[14:40] overcometh will i make a pillar in the
[14:41] temple of my god and he shall go no more
[14:43] out
[14:44] and i will write upon him the name of my
[14:46] god in the name of the city of my god
[14:48] which is new jerusalem which cometh down
[14:50] out of the heaven from my god
[14:51] and i will write upon him my new name he
[14:54] that hath an ear let him hear
[14:56] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[14:57] let's just have a word of prayer
[14:58] heavenly father
[15:00] lord we come as we just approach this
[15:01] lesson lord and i don't know
[15:03] maybe how exactly this will go um
[15:06] but lord we just want to give the
[15:07] evening to you we want to enjoy the
[15:10] fellowship of the brethren
[15:13] sisters together like precious faith
[15:16] lord with the word that you've
[15:18] given to us lord how pure and holy this
[15:21] is that we can come together and just
[15:22] look upon these things father so
[15:25] anoint us to hear anoint me to speak
[15:26] lord and may we enjoy this lesson lord
[15:29] as you've
[15:29] as you've given it lord and may we learn
[15:32] from it may we grow
[15:34] may we be challenged and strengthened um
[15:37] lord as i just tell a few things and
[15:40] testimony out of
[15:41] my life to add to this lord i just i
[15:44] pray that it'd be a blessing to the
[15:45] people
[15:47] so father we give all things to you we
[15:48] love you and we we lay our hearts before
[15:51] you and yield to you
[15:52] would you come now we ask in the name of
[15:54] the lord jesus christ amen
[15:56] amen you may be seated
[16:00] so everyone's favorite part of of every
[16:03] church age lesson is the memorization
[16:05] section
[16:06] um and we we what we do because this is
[16:09] just how i feel like people learn
[16:11] is we recite together the memorization
[16:13] section because if you want to
[16:14] recite something now you know you just
[16:17] look
[16:18] you don't have to sit there and cram
[16:19] like what you do is over a short
[16:22] you know significant period of time
[16:24] whether that be months or weeks or
[16:25] whatever
[16:27] if you were to just you know recite
[16:29] something out loud like three times
[16:31] every day you'd have it memorized in
[16:34] short order
[16:35] really wouldn't take that long so you
[16:37] don't have it's not hard to memorize
[16:39] something it's just
[16:40] a little faithfulness for a lengthy
[16:42] period of time and it really goes a long
[16:43] way my
[16:44] my kids when they were young ish
[16:47] i don't know what was it ten and eight
[16:49] or something like the boys were ten and
[16:50] eight probably i think something like
[16:52] that eleven
[16:53] nine something like that um i don't know
[16:57] i was one of those parents that just
[16:58] had grand ideas for their children and
[17:01] you know we had a homeschool group and
[17:03] i i don't know maybe he's part of a
[17:05] little parent pride i don't know
[17:06] probably a lot of that but um we started
[17:09] we started memorizing hebrews chapter
[17:11] 11. so my 11 year old boy and my
[17:14] nine-year-old boy
[17:15] memorized the entirety of hebrews
[17:17] chapter 11. now it had been my original
[17:18] intention that i could just be like
[17:20] hey zion what's verse 16 and expect him
[17:22] to just quote that exactly
[17:23] what verse 16 was we never got that far
[17:26] but they could go they could start at
[17:27] one and get through 40 or how many other
[17:29] verses there are you know
[17:30] and then and then we had a homeschool
[17:33] play thing and so i was like well these
[17:34] guys have already memorized this let's
[17:36] just make a play out of hebrews chapter
[17:37] 11. so they would quote a couple verses
[17:39] and then
[17:39] you know act out a little clip out of
[17:42] each
[17:42] thing so all that to say you know an 11
[17:45] and 9 year old can memorize hebrews
[17:46] chapter 11
[17:48] because we just work on it like every
[17:50] night for three months
[17:52] it wasn't that hard it was just every
[17:54] night for three months
[17:55] we didn't spend two hours it was like 20
[17:57] minutes a night for three months
[17:59] they had it memorized so this is how you
[18:01] learn
[18:02] it's not that hard so let's recite
[18:04] together this is
[18:06] this is me teaching now okay so i was a
[18:08] little more preachy this morning now
[18:09] i'll probably get a little preachy
[18:10] tonight too but we're teaching right now
[18:12] so
[18:12] we memorize together or we recite
[18:15] together there isn't anything
[18:17] in this life satisfying as it may be
[18:20] as good and fine as it may be but you
[18:23] will find the sum
[18:25] total of all perfection in christ
[18:28] everything fades into insignificance
[18:31] beside him
[18:33] the poetry that's in the church age book
[18:36] is at times unmatched
[18:38] this is worth memorizing
[18:41] the sum total of all perfection is in
[18:42] christ and everything fades into
[18:44] insignificance plus i
[18:45] like man a brother can preach on that
[18:47] for a good long while
[18:49] that's worth memorizing so each section
[18:51] um
[18:52] in the in a in a book that you have uh
[18:55] each each chapter has a memorization
[18:57] section
[18:58] and if you just were to apply yourself a
[19:00] little bit you'd have these
[19:01] nuggets like this memorized and guess
[19:04] what happens when you have a nugget like
[19:05] this memorized
[19:06] well well you can quote it brother
[19:07] trevor yeah but you can quote it to the
[19:09] devil
[19:11] you can quote it to your friends you can
[19:12] quote it to somebody you're witnessing
[19:14] to
[19:15] the devil might come and attack you and
[19:17] you can remind yourself
[19:19] there's a there's a lot of benefits to
[19:21] hiding the word of god in your heart so
[19:24] so that's why i chose little selections
[19:26] out of each
[19:27] chapter to go through so anyhow so we're
[19:30] going to go into the introduction
[19:32] to philadelphia the philadelphian church
[19:34] age the introduction will encompass the
[19:36] city
[19:36] the age and the messenger
[19:40] so focusing here then on revelations
[19:42] chapter 3 and verse 7
[19:44] a to the angel of the church in
[19:46] philadelphia write
[19:47] these things saith he that is holy so we
[19:51] just
[19:51] what we do is what brother branham does
[19:53] in the church age book is just break it
[19:55] down phrase by phrase
[19:57] i don't know if you caught that before
[19:58] but he's just breaking it down phrase by
[19:59] phrase so if you read through the whole
[20:01] you know the whole letter to that church
[20:04] you go man there's a lot of stuff i
[20:06] don't understand well you read the
[20:07] church age book and
[20:08] brother branham explains every single
[20:09] clause every single phrase
[20:11] you know it's great it's just good to be
[20:13] a christian
[20:14] it's good to be a message believer we
[20:15] have so much at our disposal but first
[20:17] before we go into the
[20:19] into this introduction because we're so
[20:22] far into this and we're now on chapter
[20:23] let's hear philadelphia's chapter uh
[20:26] eight um
[20:30] we and and would be the sixth church age
[20:32] we would have to list
[20:34] the first five church ages in order does
[20:37] anybody
[20:38] want to take a stab at what you've
[20:40] learned and i know you haven't been
[20:41] having the benefit of me teaching but
[20:43] maybe just maybe somebody
[20:44] has memorized the seven church ages in
[20:47] order
[20:48] does anybody want to take a stab at that
[20:50] now in our church we had a 10 year old
[20:51] boy embarrass all the adults
[20:54] so anybody not my kids
[20:57] that's not fair they were the test
[21:00] subjects they did it as a homeschool
[21:02] curriculum which you know if you have if
[21:03] you homeschool and you have high school
[21:05] age kids like you could
[21:06] you could do it brother did you want to
[21:07] do were you was that no okay
[21:11] all right so we're going to do ephesus
[21:13] smyrna
[21:15] pergamos thyatira sardis
[21:18] then now we're on philadelphia and then
[21:19] of course laodicea will come
[21:21] and then does anybody want to take a
[21:22] stab at the first five church age
[21:24] messengers in order
[21:27] paul irenaeus martin columba luther
[21:31] then what
[21:35] that's not you all can't read you all
[21:38] can't read that though that's too
[21:39] like can you read that
[21:46] all right and then i gave bonus points
[21:49] out for anybody that could tell me the
[21:50] years the first five church ages in
[21:52] order but with years
[21:53] ephesus 53 to 170 oh brother
[21:57] i'm getting brother wade now yeah 53 to
[22:00] 170 smyrna 170 to 312 pergamos 312 to
[22:03] 606.
[22:04] thyatira 606 to 1520 stardust 1520
[22:08] to 1750. i could probably do that but i
[22:11] have a cheat sheet in front of me
[22:12] so i didn't because that's embarrassing
[22:15] when you mess up in front of people
[22:17] and then we go through the first this is
[22:19] all things that you would
[22:20] be encouraged to memorize if you were
[22:22] going through this
[22:23] this book um and the first
[22:26] first five church ages meanings in order
[22:29] what ephesus means
[22:31] it means aimed at or relaxed
[22:34] or aimed at and then relaxed and then
[22:36] smyrna bitterness
[22:38] pergamus thoroughly married thyatira
[22:41] dominating female or
[22:42] laxed loose lazy sardis escaped ones
[22:46] and philadelphia well we haven't learned
[22:47] that yet so we won't get there
[22:49] bodily love of course and so so then we
[22:51] go into the age and we begin to look at
[22:53] the conditions
[22:54] of the age i need to do maybe a little
[22:55] bit of background but
[22:57] well we'll do that here on this map um
[23:00] this
[23:00] map you know you just this map i show
[23:04] every at the introduction to every age
[23:06] and the reason i show this map
[23:08] is this is a this is a scale drawing
[23:10] from google earth
[23:11] brother branham says that the area in
[23:13] the um
[23:14] asia minor here was either the size of
[23:17] indiana which is this
[23:18] or the size about the size of
[23:20] pennsylvania so that gives you a little
[23:22] bit of scale it took me like four hours
[23:24] to do this map
[23:25] i bring it up every age
[23:29] so i never want to spend four hours
[23:31] doing something that like that again
[23:33] so everybody just gets to look at this
[23:34] map because it took a long time and i
[23:36] just need to get mileage out of that to
[23:37] make it worth it
[23:38] it's a personal thing so but then what
[23:40] we one of the things that we
[23:41] we would have already discussed in the
[23:43] intro to the ages is we see we have
[23:44] ephesus smyrna pergamos thyotaro sardis
[23:46] philadelphia laodicea
[23:48] and we know that those are the ages but
[23:49] then wait what are these other little
[23:51] guys why are they there like there's
[23:53] lycia pamphylia lystra iconium derby
[23:55] antioch all of these other samoa
[23:56] theories all these other places paul
[23:58] went there there were churches there
[23:59] were christians there
[24:00] why these seven why these seven and what
[24:03] you would have learned and what we
[24:05] we just background really quick is that
[24:06] is that those seven were chosen because
[24:08] the characteristics of the city
[24:10] match the characteristics of the age
[24:12] that was to come so what was going on in
[24:14] the city
[24:15] was what was going to be going on in
[24:17] that age and the typing there
[24:19] different things that brother branham
[24:20] would bring out of that city
[24:22] and then what we're going to learn today
[24:23] is about the coin that was that was the
[24:25] money that they were they used in
[24:26] philadelphia and how that typed that
[24:29] that philadelphian age and what was
[24:30] going on spiritually during that age
[24:33] so that's why there's these seven are
[24:35] chosen there's many other christian
[24:37] churches but these seven are chosen for
[24:38] a specific reason
[24:40] it's the characteristics of the age so
[24:43] then
[24:44] we just go on to our timeline and as we
[24:45] looked as we talked
[24:47] you know through the ages and how many
[24:49] years and all of that
[24:50] and why do i why do i bring this up why
[24:53] do i show you a timeline
[24:54] well you're here you're right here well
[24:57] if you're right here what does that mean
[24:58] for here
[25:00] all right all right you're on this
[25:02] timeline this timeline's reality this
[25:04] isn't story
[25:05] this isn't some fictitious thing that
[25:07] happened in long time ago and on land
[25:09] far far away
[25:10] you know whatever it was no this is
[25:12] reality this happened on this earth
[25:14] things that happened through these ages
[25:16] happen to people like you and i
[25:18] on this earth just over there in in asia
[25:21] minor
[25:22] or perhaps as we talk spiritually
[25:24] through the age around the world
[25:26] so so these things happen you're
[25:28] connected to it this is history
[25:30] not story all right so so that's why i
[25:33] always want to bring this up and so now
[25:35] we're going to be talking about an age
[25:36] very very close to one right before
[25:37] where we lived
[25:38] and so you know they had horse-drawn
[25:42] carriages back then
[25:43] stuff like that you know like you know
[25:45] not too far away
[25:46] okay that was a really long time away
[25:48] but you know i don't know but
[25:50] i just want you to you know connect
[25:51] yourself here recognize this isn't
[25:54] this isn't this isn't fiction
[25:58] this happened that in 80 95 and 96 john
[26:02] is on patmos
[26:03] getting uh getting having a vision of
[26:05] these things writing them down as the
[26:07] lord told him to
[26:08] and then now as we read in the scripture
[26:11] there would come
[26:12] malachi 4 5 and 6 revelations 10 7 to
[26:14] restore the faith
[26:16] and guess what it actually happened and
[26:18] now that that messenger
[26:19] can can show us exactly what was already
[26:23] written down in
[26:24] 95 96 but was
[26:27] hidden was written in symbol form so a
[26:29] prophet could come
[26:31] so that people all through these ages
[26:33] wouldn't wouldn't think like oh jesus is
[26:35] coming tomorrow well
[26:35] we wanted them to think jesus come
[26:37] tomorrow live like jesus is coming
[26:38] tomorrow
[26:39] but there was going to come an age when
[26:40] you actually knew and had the revelation
[26:42] that hey man these people
[26:44] it was going to be a thousand years for
[26:46] them maybe they didn't know it but they
[26:48] knew
[26:48] they were to live as jesus was coming
[26:50] tomorrow and so
[26:52] so then he begins to to show the history
[26:54] and how this history absolutely types
[26:56] the characteristics
[26:58] that was baked into each age into the
[26:59] word of god in symbol form
[27:02] for us man that's incredible
[27:05] and people stay atheists somehow i don't
[27:07] get it
[27:08] because i look at that and think that is
[27:10] the most amazing
[27:12] un like the you talking about the author
[27:15] of all authors
[27:17] that can that can throw twists and turns
[27:20] in that you don't see coming
[27:22] and you read it the first time and
[27:23] you're like wow that was amazing didn't
[27:24] see that
[27:25] and you read it the second time and
[27:26] there's twists and turns you didn't see
[27:29] coming still and you read it a third
[27:31] time and you find out more why because
[27:33] the unchanging god
[27:34] just gets deeper and bigger the more you
[27:36] learn about him as we said this morning
[27:38] and so you know you read i don't know
[27:40] what what books you might read but you
[27:42] you
[27:42] you you know name your favorite novel
[27:44] you read it the second time and it's not
[27:46] as good as the first time
[27:48] the bible gets better the more time more
[27:50] times you read it
[27:51] it's the only book that's the only book
[27:55] that gets better every time you read it
[27:57] any other book
[27:59] you're just like i heard i know this
[28:00] story like i get it like i it's
[28:02] you know oh yeah you know at the end
[28:05] it's going to be revealed like
[28:06] this guy did it all along but then you
[28:09] read it again you already know that
[28:11] you read the bible again you're finding
[28:12] things you didn't know
[28:14] you're connecting things you're seeing
[28:16] things it's
[28:17] this is the master author that we're
[28:20] studying here
[28:21] so okay philadelphia the city um the
[28:25] the characteristic that brother branham
[28:27] brings out is the coin of bacchus now i
[28:29] have a coin of bacchus this
[28:30] wasn't the one that brother branham is
[28:32] talking about in philadelphia if you
[28:33] were to search this on the internet you
[28:34] would find this
[28:35] and then you would find something else
[28:37] on the back but what brother branham
[28:38] explains on this one
[28:39] is that is that it doesn't matter look
[28:42] the coin is minted
[28:44] and and it had the god on the front and
[28:46] it had the priestess on the back
[28:49] and it didn't matter which which way the
[28:51] coin fell
[28:52] you were getting the same thing and
[28:56] now what we had just done was we had
[28:58] just come out of
[28:59] the luther age the time period there
[29:01] where luther came out guess what
[29:03] so before luther christianity was either
[29:05] the true church or the catholic church
[29:07] that's all you had
[29:09] you had that mother harlot right and
[29:10] then but that mother harlow was going to
[29:12] have daughters the thalia was going to
[29:13] have
[29:13] was going to have daughters right so so
[29:15] okay um
[29:16] but those daughters were going to be
[29:17] exactly like her
[29:20] right so she's going to have daughters
[29:22] exactly like her
[29:25] guess what these coins when they're
[29:26] minted they're minted exactly alike
[29:27] every single one of them
[29:28] just another one another one another one
[29:30] so before luther all you had
[29:33] was you had and you had a athelia
[29:35] religion or you had
[29:36] you know just true christianity but then
[29:39] after luther now suddenly because luther
[29:41] protests the catholic church he begins
[29:43] to
[29:43] you know now we have different
[29:45] denominations because we have
[29:46] luther comes out and kind of they create
[29:48] this different thing but then some
[29:50] people
[29:50] disagree with them a little bit and
[29:51] create their own and now you have
[29:53] splintering but what are you getting
[29:54] you're getting daughters when before you
[29:56] just had mother now you're getting
[29:58] daughters
[29:58] you're getting coins minted over and
[30:00] over and over again
[30:02] when i first started reading that the
[30:03] church book and that's i was studying
[30:05] this and i
[30:06] i was like lord how am i going to do
[30:08] this lesson like why is brother bryan
[30:09] talking about a coin
[30:10] who cares like that is this coin is the
[30:13] most uninteresting thing in this church
[30:14] age book what
[30:16] and then you know anytime you're reading
[30:18] the bible or you're reading the message
[30:19] and you're like this is dumb
[30:21] like there's probably something
[30:24] that's like really amazing that you're
[30:26] just missing so like
[30:28] stop say lord okay there's something
[30:30] here because when i saw that point i was
[30:32] like
[30:32] you know mind blown like oh i get it now
[30:34] the mintage of the coin
[30:36] it's the priestess and the god on the
[30:37] same one and then there's more of them
[30:39] i was like oh okay i get it that's
[30:40] denominations like wow
[30:42] okay that's pretty cool so
[30:46] um so that's you know that's that was
[30:48] the characteristic that the age
[30:50] that brother branham brought out is that
[30:51] here they have this coin and it's
[30:53] it's the god and it's the priestess on
[30:55] the back but the age
[30:57] the age has the same thing it has that
[30:59] false god system
[31:01] and it's priestess and it's either mary
[31:05] or the church rather mary here now now
[31:09] some of this is hard to do because you
[31:10] haven't been through like i haven't
[31:11] taken you through
[31:12] lessons you know 35 and 36 i i think
[31:15] lesson 25 where we
[31:17] where we really go through and we take
[31:19] you from nimrod
[31:20] and you go through hislop's two babylons
[31:22] because then pergamos and the pergami in
[31:23] church age brother branham just
[31:24] man he lays that out it's so cool and he
[31:27] lays out what started in
[31:29] at the tower of babel and nimrod and
[31:31] kush started this pagan religion and
[31:32] they had these mysteries and then
[31:34] you get semiramis involved and all
[31:35] through down the history and then
[31:36] suddenly and
[31:37] i'm kind of wishing i would have thrown
[31:39] these slides in but how many of you have
[31:40] seen pictures of mary
[31:42] like on the on the internet like you see
[31:44] you know you type in
[31:45] pictures of mary what color is her hair
[31:50] somebody said blonde just about every
[31:52] picture that you see an artist raphael's
[31:54] mary mike i think michelangelo's married
[31:56] just different ones
[31:57] blonde blonde because
[32:01] artists you know italian artists would
[32:03] paint mary
[32:04] probably similar to girls like the um no
[32:07] not like girls they're used to seeing in
[32:08] italy that's not blonde hair is it
[32:11] oh it's because mary as a jewish girl
[32:14] like raphael was like oh she was a
[32:16] jewish girl i'm gonna paint her with
[32:18] blonde
[32:19] hair yeah that doesn't work either so it
[32:23] what could it be well home maybe because
[32:24] it's semiramis actually who married
[32:26] nimrod
[32:27] was known as the woman this this queen
[32:30] with golden
[32:30] hair that was so absolutely beautiful
[32:33] and oh by the way like
[32:35] these these catholic missionaries went
[32:37] to china and they saw the same
[32:39] exact blond-haired woman with a baby
[32:44] the first catholic missionaries the
[32:45] first catholic missionaries
[32:47] to ever go into china find a madonna and
[32:49] a child with blonde hair
[32:51] and they're like wait how did you get
[32:52] that because we that's our religion and
[32:54] you got that
[32:55] because they both got the same pagan
[32:57] religion from nimrod and semiramis so
[32:58] that's just a little
[33:00] foretaste we're going to get into some
[33:01] of the other things but that's you know
[33:02] it's like
[33:03] that's when this catholic religion
[33:05] started was there at nimrod
[33:06] and it became a pagan thing that was
[33:08] mixed then with christianity you
[33:09] probably know a lot of that but
[33:11] we really break it down but anyway so
[33:16] so let's look at the messenger um john
[33:18] wesley
[33:19] now i was fortunate enough to have
[33:22] traveled to england now i traveled to
[33:23] england to preach before
[33:25] before or right during the early time
[33:27] that i was doing this
[33:29] so i hadn't really like i didn't record
[33:31] this
[33:32] this footage i did it for my family but
[33:35] then i took it and tried to
[33:36] make a nice little video that i'm about
[33:38] to show you that kind of introduces
[33:41] wesley where he was some of some of the
[33:45] you know his house and his church and
[33:46] different things i was there i recorded
[33:48] it so my family could see it
[33:50] and hopefully you find it a blessing so
[33:52] if the brothers can
[33:53] can maybe yeah you could kill the lights
[33:57] that probably be nicer
[33:58] because it's like 10 minutes so i'll
[33:59] just sit down and
[34:02] john wesley the angel messenger of the
[34:05] philadelphian church age
[34:07] was born in epworth uk on june 17
[34:10] 1703 to susanna and samuel wesley
[34:15] let's travel together to epworth to
[34:17] learn
[34:18] of john's young life this morning i am
[34:21] in
[34:21] epworth in the united kingdom this is
[34:24] the home
[34:24] of john and charles wesley as they were
[34:27] children this is the
[34:28] this is the home of the wesleys this is
[34:32] where susannah wesley raised her
[34:34] 17 children and as brother branham said
[34:36] spent the
[34:38] three hours each day to pray with her
[34:40] children and she would read
[34:42] her husband's sermons to the children
[34:44] and the maids and different ones and
[34:46] so um it was here at this location this
[34:49] is not the
[34:50] uh original structure in 1709 the
[34:52] original structure was burned down
[34:55] john wesley was five and a half years
[34:57] old and he was actually in the second
[34:59] story during the fire
[35:01] and uh as this fire is going on john was
[35:04] sure to be consumed in the blaze but was
[35:07] uh
[35:07] very at the last minute plucked out of
[35:10] the window from the second story window
[35:12] uh and saved from from a certain death
[35:14] there so god just uh
[35:17] maintaining the life of his sixth church
[35:20] age messenger to come
[35:21] so this is a very historic home they now
[35:25] have
[35:25] a museum here and for the wesley time
[35:29] period
[35:30] but this is the home where john and
[35:32] charles wesley
[35:34] lived in as children this bible was
[35:37] found in the rubble
[35:38] and miraculously preserved from the fire
[35:41] of the rectory in
[35:42] epworth in later years john referred to
[35:44] himself as a brand
[35:46] plucked from the fire drawing from
[35:48] zechariah 3 verse 2
[35:49] this painting depicts this event of john
[35:52] being saved from the fire
[35:54] just seconds before the roof collapsed
[35:58] wesley grew and finished primary school
[36:01] and attended oxford university
[36:03] while in school he and some of his
[36:04] friends studied the bible together
[36:06] and did good works they were called
[36:08] methodists for the good methods that
[36:10] they used after some years
[36:13] wesley traveled to america and preached
[36:15] in georgia
[36:16] his trip was not successful he said
[36:19] i went to america to convert the indians
[36:21] but oh
[36:22] who shall convert me finally
[36:26] on may 24th 1738 wesley
[36:29] found salvation about a quarter before 9
[36:33] while he was describing the change which
[36:35] god works in the heart through faith in
[36:36] christ
[36:38] i felt my heart strangely warmed i felt
[36:41] i did trust in christ christ alone for
[36:44] salvation
[36:46] and an assurance was given me that he
[36:48] had taken away my sins
[36:50] even mine and saved me from the law of
[36:53] sin and death
[36:55] after his conversion it was no longer
[36:58] merely about works
[36:59] and his fellow man but his preaching
[37:01] took on a new life
[37:03] so much so that the established church
[37:05] of england
[37:06] began to push him out wesley would have
[37:09] to begin preaching outdoors
[37:11] instead of in churches
[37:15] here i have all that was mortal of
[37:17] samuel wesley
[37:19] he was rector of epworth 39
[37:23] [Music]
[37:29] this is the grave of john wesley's
[37:32] father samuel wesley
[37:33] and actually here in the summer of 1742
[37:38] john wesley because his preaching was
[37:40] contrary to
[37:41] the prevailing thought of the church of
[37:43] england at the time
[37:44] was kicked out of the church and could
[37:47] not preach
[37:47] inside this beautiful church here behind
[37:50] me
[37:51] so what he did was he came outside and
[37:54] he said this is the grave of my father
[37:57] you can't kick me off of the grave of my
[37:59] own father so he
[38:00] he stood up i won't stand here just
[38:03] respect to the grave and the
[38:04] preservation but
[38:05] he stood up on the grave and began to
[38:08] preach the people and people began to
[38:10] assemble
[38:11] and he said you can't keep me off of my
[38:12] own father's grave so he used his
[38:14] father's grave
[38:16] as his own pulpit to preach to the
[38:18] people in 1742
[38:21] wesley began traveling across england
[38:24] covering 4 500 miles per year on
[38:27] horseback
[38:28] he preached up to four times a day
[38:30] averaging 800
[38:32] sermons per year most of them outdoors
[38:36] on the steps of the intersection in
[38:38] ebworth his birthplace
[38:40] and in places like paradise square in
[38:43] sheffield where he said
[38:45] i preached in paradise square in
[38:46] sheffield to the largest congregation
[38:49] i ever saw on a weekday i'm standing in
[38:53] paradise square just up the road from
[38:57] here
[38:58] was the church of england you can see
[39:00] that there in the background
[39:02] and here in paradise square john wesley
[39:05] preached in sheffield england
[39:07] um they wouldn't let him preach in the
[39:09] church
[39:10] so he came over here to paradise square
[39:13] and
[39:15] decided well i can preach right in here
[39:19] and so all the people assembled in here
[39:20] there was more people
[39:22] in the square that was could have fit in
[39:25] the church
[39:26] as you can see here there's quite a
[39:29] large
[39:30] parking area and the acoustics are
[39:33] really good
[39:33] hallelujah so you could hear very well
[39:37] and so john wesley preached here um
[39:41] to a large congregation of people maybe
[39:44] he would have said something like
[39:45] without holiness no man shall see the
[39:49] lord
[39:50] and i really don't even have to raise my
[39:51] voice and i can hear it echoing
[39:53] quite well so paradise square
[39:57] sheffield england over time john wesley
[40:01] built a chapel in london
[40:02] that could be his church home and base
[40:05] of operations i'm at john wesley's
[40:08] chapel and we're headed to see
[40:10] john wesley's house going down the
[40:13] stairs
[40:15] here and into his house
[40:19] you'll notice as we enter john wesley's
[40:22] home
[40:23] the common uh smallness
[40:27] of the english home where
[40:30] things just aren't quite as big it kind
[40:33] of opens up as
[40:34] part of the ceilings here really quite
[40:38] compact
[40:40] i'm standing in john wesley's home
[40:43] the room over here where john wesley
[40:47] himself would have eaten
[40:49] and had food prepared here is his
[40:53] house coat and many of his personal
[40:55] effects his
[40:57] communion glass that he would take with
[41:00] him
[41:01] the family christening robe where they
[41:04] were
[41:05] all the children were baptized in this
[41:08] robe so
[41:09] many of the personal effects and even
[41:11] some of john wesley's
[41:13] hair right there so pretty amazing our
[41:16] tour guide is
[41:17] trying to give us a quick tour so we're
[41:19] gonna head upstairs and see some more
[41:21] i'm here in john wesley's sitting room
[41:23] where after maybe a meal
[41:26] you would have come and and had a bit of
[41:27] fellowship with uh with john wesley
[41:30] here over they have charles wesley's
[41:34] desk uh very likely
[41:37] that he may have penned hims from this
[41:40] desk right here
[41:42] so that is a very cool treasure of
[41:45] history
[41:46] here's wesley's sitting room his
[41:50] personal books oh my goodness
[41:55] really old books that were wesley's over
[41:58] here we have a
[41:59] very interesting chair this chair right
[42:01] here with the funky arms it was a
[42:04] fighting chair
[42:05] um and um wesley turned it into a
[42:08] reading chair you would sit on it
[42:10] backwards put your arms on it and
[42:11] use the the tray to put the book on
[42:15] which emulated
[42:16] kind of like riding a horse and reading
[42:18] a book on a horse
[42:20] i stood in this pulpit that where you go
[42:22] every morning five o'clock and preach to
[42:23] fifteen hundred people
[42:24] i said in his chair where he wanted a
[42:26] chicken uh a
[42:28] fighter that a fellow used to fight had
[42:30] rooster fight he wanted to christ
[42:32] and had a letter over like this and two
[42:34] big horns and a place like this is set
[42:36] up
[42:36] on this side like here where they take
[42:38] record of the fight and
[42:39] after wesley was converted uh wesley
[42:42] converted this man to christ
[42:43] then he gave him the chair and i sat in
[42:45] the chair
[42:47] and prayed standing
[42:50] inside wesley's chapel built in 1739
[42:55] so john wesley could have a home base of
[42:57] sorts in london
[42:59] this behind me is john wesley's pulpit
[43:02] it actually used to be as high as the
[43:03] balcony
[43:04] but they took the middle section out
[43:06] because that that became
[43:07] unfashionable much of the decoration you
[43:10] can see the hideous columns behind me
[43:12] are not original originally they had
[43:15] beams
[43:16] uh taken from british warships uh and
[43:18] recycled
[43:19] uh but those riddled with bullet holes
[43:21] and worms
[43:22] didn't last but a hundred years
[43:26] behind me here is the communion table
[43:29] where
[43:29] john wesley himself would have served
[43:32] communion
[43:33] and of course here's the back side of
[43:35] the pulpit
[43:36] that he would have preached out of so
[43:39] quite a bit of history here
[43:41] we end this video at john wesley's
[43:43] memorial grave
[43:45] where many come including brother
[43:47] branham in 1950
[43:49] to pay their respects to this great man
[43:51] of god
[43:53] to the memory of the venerable john
[43:55] wesley
[43:56] this great light arose by the singular
[43:58] providence of god
[44:00] to enlighten these nations and to revive
[44:03] and force and defend the pure
[44:06] apostolical
[44:07] doctrines and practices of the primitive
[44:09] church which he continued to do
[44:12] both by his writings and his labors for
[44:14] more than half a century
[44:16] and to his inexpressible joy not only be
[44:19] held their influence extending
[44:22] and their efficacy witnessed in the
[44:24] hearts and lives of many thousands
[44:26] but also far above all human power of
[44:30] expectation
[44:31] lived to see provision made by the
[44:33] singular grace of god
[44:35] for their continuance and establishment
[44:38] to the joy
[44:39] of future generations reader
[44:42] if thou art constrained to bless the
[44:44] instrument
[44:45] give god the glory after having
[44:48] languished a few days
[44:50] he at length fulfilled his course and
[44:52] his life together
[44:54] gloriously triumphing over death march
[44:57] the 2nd
[44:57] 1781 in the 88th year
[45:01] of his age
[45:08] where he converted the rooster fighter
[45:10] that time on this chair
[45:12] i had his robe over my shoulder nailed
[45:14] in the floor where that godly man died
[45:17] and offered prayer and thank god for a
[45:18] man like john wesley
[45:33] amen so i hope you enjoyed that
[45:36] um thank you
[45:39] i did one um i did one on columba as
[45:42] well
[45:43] that was terrible i had to travel to the
[45:44] lion uh to the island of iona in
[45:46] scotland
[45:47] and um you know i had to suffer for two
[45:50] three days on that island
[45:52] yeah it was tough it was tough i loved
[45:55] every minute of it
[45:57] there was no mcdonald's though it was a
[45:58] small island and and and if you wanted
[46:00] to eat you had to be at the hotel at the
[46:02] right time
[46:03] and i was not used to that so there was
[46:05] one time i was uh i got up early in the
[46:07] morning and i went to
[46:08] where columbus came to the bay and i was
[46:11] trying to do some filming there and then
[46:13] i realized
[46:14] like i'm a i'm a good
[46:17] brisk 50-minute walk away and
[46:20] breakfast closes in an hour so
[46:24] i hoofed it over and i got my breakfast
[46:26] because it would have been nothing
[46:27] nothing until noon because that's just
[46:29] how it worked and
[46:30] it's not america that's for sure it was
[46:32] a small island but it was lovely
[46:34] so i did one i went there specifically
[46:36] to shoot a video for that so this one
[46:37] wasn't shot specifically for it
[46:39] and i didn't you know there's a lot of
[46:40] wind and stuff but that was the best i
[46:43] could do
[46:43] on a on a budget you know so i hope that
[46:46] was a blessing
[46:47] and just enjoyed that so now
[46:51] um that's the introduction to to the
[46:53] messenger and i let the video do that
[46:55] instead of having to actually talk about
[46:57] it but
[46:58] we can then go into um in the church age
[47:02] uh message brother brenham says many
[47:04] books of his talking about john wesley
[47:06] was
[47:07] wrote of slander about him in his day
[47:09] slandering him
[47:10] making fun of him they've long been
[47:12] forgotten now and so has their authors
[47:14] you can't do nothing against a child of
[47:16] god and get by with it you just
[47:18] you just fighting the air god is going
[47:21] to take them right on through anyhow
[47:23] i think that's pretty instructive to us
[47:25] today
[47:26] and there are many people wanting to
[47:28] slander
[47:30] the messenger of this age there'll come
[47:33] a time that will long be forgotten
[47:35] but if this thing goes on this message
[47:38] it's going to keep shining
[47:40] amen so so that kind of closes our
[47:43] introduction to
[47:44] the age um or well to the to the city
[47:48] to the messenger i want to just talk
[47:50] about the conditions
[47:51] of the age just a little bit and what
[47:54] was going on there
[47:55] and so we we understand
[47:59] because we know the seals now uh we
[48:02] understand that this is now the age of
[48:03] man
[48:04] that we've come through the lion age
[48:06] we've come through the ox age and now
[48:08] we're in the age of man
[48:09] and and the catholic church has now been
[48:10] protested and now we have reformers
[48:12] coming out great reformers and they're
[48:14] coming and they're preaching
[48:15] they're making bibles they're printing
[48:17] literature they're spreading it out all
[48:19] across the
[48:20] earth and there's a great reformation
[48:22] and and a great awakening and a second
[48:24] great awakening beginning to happen
[48:26] and so there's missionaries going out
[48:27] and and going and taking the gospel of
[48:30] jesus christ
[48:31] to all the earth now brother branham
[48:33] begins to to talk about this because
[48:35] this is what
[48:36] this age is doing now as far as
[48:38] literally just going
[48:39] sending the message of the gospel on
[48:41] paper tracks and so forth
[48:42] the gospel has long ago went to every
[48:44] nation under the heavens
[48:46] long ago so you see that goes to prove
[48:48] that wasn't what jesus was talking about
[48:51] when he never said go into all the world
[48:53] and make bible schools
[48:55] neither did he say go all into all the
[48:57] world and pass out literature
[48:58] those things are fine there's a place
[49:00] for those things there's a time for
[49:02] those things
[49:03] but his commission to the church was go
[49:06] into all the world
[49:07] and preach the gospel and the gospel is
[49:10] not altogether the word
[49:12] but it's making the word come to life
[49:16] if we're gonna preach the gospel if
[49:18] we're gonna say hey
[49:20] you know like so what does gospel mean
[49:22] well well we understand it means the
[49:23] good news
[49:25] but but did jesus now now when we say
[49:28] we're preaching the gospel
[49:29] as christians in our day you know or if
[49:32] you say you know
[49:32] let's say what the baptist's uh
[49:35] definition of preaching the gospel would
[49:36] be what would that mean
[49:38] and i think sometimes that's what our
[49:40] definition of is
[49:42] is the same you know is it's because
[49:44] since wesley's age we think
[49:45] preaching the gospel what does that mean
[49:47] telling people that
[49:48] jesus came and died for their sins
[49:51] that's what we think preaching the
[49:52] gospel is
[49:53] it's not that the gospel that jesus died
[49:55] for your sins that should be
[49:56] a fairly basic christian you know thing
[49:59] that
[50:00] most everybody understands in that way
[50:02] but i but but
[50:03] jesus came and preached the gospel
[50:06] well what gospel was he preaching he
[50:08] wasn't preaching hate jesus came and
[50:10] died for your sins
[50:12] no what he was saying was the kingdom of
[50:14] heaven is coming to you
[50:15] no the messiah is coming that thing that
[50:18] you're
[50:18] the good news is that thing that you're
[50:21] looking for
[50:22] the thing that you're seeking for in
[50:24] your life these jews are waiting their
[50:26] entire lives for generation
[50:28] after generation for thousands of years
[50:30] they've been promised a coming messiah
[50:33] from the genesis chapter three man
[50:36] they're
[50:36] waiting for a messiah to come
[50:40] and so jesus comes along and he begins
[50:42] to preach the good news
[50:44] that the kingdom of heaven has come to
[50:45] you messiah
[50:47] is here that's the good news
[50:53] and if messiah is here well what's he
[50:56] going to do
[50:58] he's going to do the things prophesied
[51:00] of the messiah to do
[51:01] he's going to set the captives free he's
[51:03] going to bind up the brokenhearted he's
[51:04] going to set at liberty them that are
[51:06] bruised and captive
[51:10] we're supposed to preach the gospel
[51:12] that's the gospel that jesus preached
[51:14] we're supposed to preach the gospel has
[51:17] the gospel changed
[51:19] has it changed that actually what we're
[51:22] saying when we're
[51:23] when we're preaching the gospel is good
[51:25] news
[51:26] the kingdom of heaven has come unto you
[51:30] and messiah is here
[51:33] that he's jesus christ the same
[51:35] yesterday
[51:36] today and forever and the messiah has
[51:40] come
[51:42] and he's going to do messiah things
[51:45] like setting captives free opening the
[51:47] blinded eyes
[51:50] it's making the word come to life
[51:54] messiah is here in our age and and truly
[51:57] what we're hearing because the prophet
[51:59] has come
[51:59] with this message of restoration is what
[52:02] they had at pentecost
[52:03] you still have because jesus christ is
[52:06] the same yesterday
[52:07] today and forever and what jesus
[52:10] preached then he's still preaching now
[52:12] what jesus did then he's still doing now
[52:16] good news has come to you
[52:20] jesus is alive and well
[52:25] [Applause]
[52:26] so that's the commission to the church
[52:30] the commission to the church let's go on
[52:33] so therefore when i say
[52:35] the pentecostal message not the
[52:36] pentecostal organization now the
[52:38] pentecostal message is the only true
[52:41] message from god why why is the
[52:43] pentecostal message the only true
[52:44] message of god well it's because
[52:46] what is the pentecostal message saying
[52:48] the holy ghost is still here
[52:51] has come and can live in you
[52:55] now look mark 16. if you're reading it
[52:57] there all right here jesus commissioned
[52:59] his church go into all the world preach
[53:00] the gospel
[53:01] these signs speaking in tongues healing
[53:02] the sick performing miracles
[53:04] we'll ask how far all the world
[53:08] how many every creature that's all the
[53:12] way down to the end here to the
[53:13] consummation all right these signs
[53:15] shall follow just this church them
[53:18] that believe in all the world all the
[53:21] world to every creature these signs
[53:23] shall follow them not this
[53:25] not this church them the people
[53:29] that believe so it's a pentecostal
[53:31] church
[53:32] the philadelphian church age in that age
[53:34] there evangelized and has missionaried
[53:37] all the complete world with literature
[53:40] jesus said when this gospel
[53:42] is preached this gospel is preached to
[53:44] all the world for a witness to me
[53:46] then the end shall be so what he's
[53:48] saying and well read it but just
[53:50] you know let me preach it here for just
[53:52] a moment what he's saying is
[53:54] is that when jesus said and i believe
[53:56] it's matthew 24
[53:57] that that hey when when the gospel is
[54:00] preached to the entire world the end
[54:02] shall be and if passing out literature
[54:05] and tracts and bibles to the entire
[54:07] world which has happened at this point
[54:10] if that was preaching the gospel then
[54:12] the word of god is in default of that
[54:14] promise
[54:15] of what he said here that the end shall
[54:17] be we should have reached the end
[54:19] but since we haven't reached the end
[54:21] there's other two there's only two
[54:22] possibilities the word is wrong and we
[54:24] don't believe that one so it's got to be
[54:25] the other possibility
[54:27] that the gospel has not actually been
[54:29] preached to all the world
[54:31] why not because passing out the
[54:33] literature telling people that jesus
[54:35] died for them
[54:36] was not preaching the gospel but the
[54:38] gospel was the good news
[54:40] that jesus christ is still here and he's
[54:42] come to you
[54:45] amen not that he died in history for you
[54:48] and you can theologically assent to that
[54:50] and accept that
[54:52] sacrifice and decide you're going to go
[54:54] to heaven with zero life change
[54:56] that's not what we're talking about but
[54:58] good hello it's way better than that
[55:00] the very one that died has come to you
[55:03] wants a relationship with you
[55:04] wants to live in your heart wants to
[55:06] change you and take you from just not
[55:08] someone sitting on a pew not someone
[55:10] sitting on a barstool
[55:11] but to take you and literally fill you
[55:14] with the life of god zoe god's own life
[55:18] what a privilege what a blessing
[55:22] the very one that created heavens and
[55:25] earth and said let there be light
[55:27] let there be this let there be that
[55:29] created everything and said wow
[55:31] that's good
[55:34] that sustains every breath of every
[55:36] being
[55:38] the power of this universe wants to come
[55:41] and put himself
[55:42] on the inside of you and this is the
[55:44] gospel why is this the gospel
[55:46] because once he gets inside of you he
[55:48] doesn't just
[55:50] as i said to our church look when you
[55:51] get the holy ghost
[55:53] it's not just it's not just taking you
[55:54] to heaven it's not just your get out of
[55:56] jail free card
[55:59] from that game we were talking about
[56:00] brother mike it's not just to get out of
[56:03] jail free card
[56:06] like i get to go to heaven because i
[56:07] have the holy ghost yay
[56:10] is that what it is to you no it's so
[56:12] much more
[56:15] what did the holy ghost do in jesus
[56:18] so i told our church well hey it's 2021
[56:20] we might as well speak the new language
[56:22] you know holy ghost
[56:23] gonna holy ghost what he did in jesus
[56:27] he's still gonna do in you when he lives
[56:29] in you he's still going to bind up the
[56:31] brokenhearted he's still going to set
[56:32] captives free he's still going to he's
[56:34] still going to open the eyes of the
[56:36] blind but he's going to do it through
[56:37] you
[56:38] this is the gospel this is the good news
[56:40] that jesus christ is alive and well
[56:42] it's not just passing out tracks but
[56:44] it's i am
[56:45] that tract you want to see
[56:49] jesus christ here you go go ahead and
[56:52] read john 3
[56:53] 16 not on my t-shirt but in my life
[56:56] he is alive and well why because he's
[56:58] living in me
[57:00] oh that's you preachers of course

[57:06] that's the 14 year old girls
[57:11] that's to 22 19
[57:14] you know something like that
[57:17] i won't keep asking people's ages people
[57:19] get nervous i can already tell it like
[57:20] oh this brother's coming down the aisle
[57:22] and it ain't going to be good
[57:24] it's to you as an individual
[57:28] holy ghost gonna holy ghost
[57:32] in your life he's gonna do things the
[57:34] holy ghost has done all throughout all
[57:36] ages in your life
[57:37] he is longing he's he's wanting to break
[57:40] free
[57:41] but not to break free out of you but to
[57:43] break through
[57:45] flowing out of you
[57:50] because your life just can't contain all
[57:52] of him man
[57:53] what gets inside of you he's just like
[57:55] oh yeah this is good
[57:56] i got another one but man i'm just gonna
[57:58] push and
[57:59] stretch and get you to grow and get you
[58:02] into places that you never thought you'd

[58:06] set that mark high
[58:08] and you begin to achieve and grow and
[58:10] and practice and
[58:11] my it's wonderful why because the holy
[58:14] ghost is inside of you saying i've got
[58:16] to
[58:17] express who i am
[58:20] it's jesus christ god almighty his life
[58:23] living on
[58:24] inside of you that can't that just isn't
[58:26] like oh oh yes the holy ghost well
[58:28] praise jesus
[58:30] thank you jesus i'm gonna sit here in
[58:32] the corner
[58:33] i'm going to heaven you going to heaven
[58:35] i'm going to oh i'm sorry
[58:41] it's more than that amen right it's more
[58:43] than that
[58:44] the commission is not to this church
[58:46] it's not to this church it's not to that
[58:48] it's to you
[58:49] as an individual you as an individual
[58:52] i said brother trevor we sisters we're
[58:54] not preachers well not behind a pulpit
[58:56] that's right but to your children glory
[59:00] yes you sure are
[59:03] fifth gospel
[59:06] you are the gospel every single one of
[59:08] you you are a gospel
[59:10] the bride of christ is the next gospel
[59:15] go ahead and preach the gospel what is
[59:18] that you
[59:20] with the power of the holy ghost on the
[59:21] inside of you
[59:24] you've been called to something amazing
[59:27] to something great too long we sit and
[59:31] we bicker about doctrines and we go back
[59:33] and forth over this and that and the
[59:35] other and there's
[59:35] man that's fine i get it you know we
[59:37] want to have proper doctrine
[59:39] but that's not what this message is
[59:42] what this message is saying is this is
[59:45] pentecost
[59:46] this is messiah this is his second
[59:49] coming
[59:50] this is him living in you this is him
[59:52] reigning on the
[59:53] on this earth right now showing all the
[59:56] world
[59:56] through your life that he is alive and
[59:59] well
[1:00:04] the power of the gospel living through
[1:00:07] you
[1:00:08] that's preaching
[1:00:11] not just teaching the doctrines
[1:00:15] but the word coming to life well then if
[1:00:17] that's what he was talking about
[1:00:18] spreading out literature sending out
[1:00:20] missionaries with reading writing
[1:00:21] arithmetic passing out tracks making
[1:00:23] people shake hands believe that there is
[1:00:24] a god
[1:00:25] if that's all it was then he's far past
[1:00:27] his coming
[1:00:32] paul said the gospel didn't come in word
[1:00:33] only but through power
[1:00:35] manifestations of the holy ghost then
[1:00:36] when jesus said go into all the world
[1:00:38] and preach the gospel
[1:00:39] he said go into the world and
[1:00:40] demonstrate oh i like that demonstrate
[1:00:43] the power of the gospel
[1:00:45] taking that word that that what it says
[1:00:47] and show the people what it says
[1:00:49] then make it manifest to them oh that
[1:00:52] proves it
[1:00:54] how do we prove scripture manifest it
[1:00:57] how do we do that well let's talk about
[1:01:00] that
[1:01:04] so i was in prayer recently and
[1:01:07] and and god
[1:01:11] god had been speaking to me for far too
[1:01:14] long
[1:01:16] two or three years i would say and i
[1:01:18] needed a deeper prayer life
[1:01:22] he said brother trevor it took two or
[1:01:24] three yeah
[1:01:25] yeah yeah how are you doing okay so
[1:01:28] anyway not alone
[1:01:29] all right so god has been telling me
[1:01:31] like you got to have better prayer life
[1:01:33] like i need you but you're not praying
[1:01:36] enough i mean and this isn't to say i
[1:01:39] don't pray
[1:01:40] you know i pray all the time you know
[1:01:44] mostly pray lying down in bed before
[1:01:46] falling asleep
[1:01:47] and that can take 20 minutes sometimes
[1:01:49] so that's good prayer
[1:01:50] you know you people that fall asleep so
[1:01:53] fast man you know what you're
[1:01:54] never mind anyway
[1:01:58] god was telling me no no you need to get
[1:02:00] on your knees
[1:02:01] you need to pray not not that i believe
[1:02:02] that you have to get on your knees to
[1:02:04] pray but but that god was asking me
[1:02:06] to step into a a a greater sincerity in
[1:02:08] my prayer
[1:02:09] and and you know look if you've got
[1:02:11] issues with your knees like i'm not
[1:02:13] i'm not persecuting you here but you
[1:02:15] know like whatever it is for you
[1:02:17] like is there a way that you can get
[1:02:19] into a deeper
[1:02:20] prayer than lying down and praying as
[1:02:24] you fall asleep
[1:02:25] because that's good that's fine but
[1:02:29] but how sincere is that
[1:02:34] i mean you could argue either way i
[1:02:35] guess but i can tell you that god was
[1:02:37] telling me no i
[1:02:39] i want you to give me some dedicated
[1:02:41] time and prayer
[1:02:42] and then after you get off your knees
[1:02:43] then you can keep praying on your bed
[1:02:45] until you fall asleep
[1:02:46] and that'll be nice but what i want from
[1:02:48] you is a deeper prayer life
[1:02:51] and i heard god tell me that for two or
[1:02:53] three solid years
[1:02:55] before i started actually doing it
[1:02:58] well praise the lord we're just going to
[1:03:01] be honest here
[1:03:06] i'm interested in proving this is real
[1:03:08] this quote right here
[1:03:09] i want to manifest that i want to prove
[1:03:12] the reality of this word in my life
[1:03:15] i was telling god so i got down on my
[1:03:17] knees i began to pray and
[1:03:18] after a while i was like lord i okay
[1:03:22] here i am i'm praying lord and if i'm
[1:03:23] gonna do this if i'm gonna be sincere
[1:03:24] god i want to be powerful
[1:03:26] is that wrong you know i'm not saying i
[1:03:30] you know for me like i think i'm going
[1:03:32] to be some message superhero with a kate
[1:03:34] you know but message teacher
[1:03:41] but i was tired of getting pushed back i
[1:03:43] was tired of faith waning in the people
[1:03:45] i was tired of people having so many
[1:03:46] questions i felt it was a stain on
[1:03:48] believers at times that we
[1:03:49] we feel so powerless when we have such a
[1:03:51] powerful message in word and gospel
[1:03:54] i told god that i knew it wasn't his
[1:03:56] fault but i knew that it was brother
[1:03:58] branham as i said this morning
[1:03:59] said i was living far below my
[1:04:01] privileges
[1:04:04] i said god i'm not trying to be selfish
[1:04:06] i'm not trying to have visions of
[1:04:07] grandeur
[1:04:08] it's not about me becoming a superhero
[1:04:11] but i don't want to see the work of
[1:04:13] christ blasphemed and pushed around any
[1:04:14] longer
[1:04:16] because it can and should be proved
[1:04:17] right
[1:04:19] i wanted to be a vessel that was clean
[1:04:20] and sincere
[1:04:22] and ready to be used should he need
[1:04:24] anything
[1:04:27] see i think
[1:04:30] sometimes the problem that we have
[1:04:34] particularly in this day is i think that
[1:04:36] we
[1:04:38] when we talk about the power of god we
[1:04:39] don't understand what that is
[1:04:41] and the problem is is that we have so
[1:04:44] much
[1:04:44] culture that perverts our understanding
[1:04:48] of what power is and you say well what
[1:04:51] is that brother trevor
[1:04:53] and some of you getting nervous again
[1:04:54] because you don't want me to go there
[1:04:57] and talk about those marvelous
[1:05:01] things that we watch those those things
[1:05:04] are just
[1:05:04] absolutely a marvel to us
[1:05:08] like superheroes if you hadn't catch the
[1:05:11] whole marvel
[1:05:12] thing yet
[1:05:16] because here's here's the thing like how
[1:05:19] do you understand being infused with
[1:05:21] power from
[1:05:22] a a a godlike source let's just say
[1:05:26] right well like you know well how does
[1:05:28] that happen well a spider bites you or
[1:05:30] you know you get some kind of you know
[1:05:33] uh scientific experiment gone wrong you
[1:05:35] know or
[1:05:36] you know something happens to you and
[1:05:39] makes you different and then we begin to
[1:05:40] think well this was
[1:05:41] must be what like the holy ghost is is
[1:05:43] this i have you know
[1:05:45] i'm basically a science experiment gone
[1:05:47] wrong now that the holy ghost has come
[1:05:48] on the inside of me
[1:05:50] and now i have super powers in my
[1:05:52] gifting
[1:05:53] and i get to you know throw a hammer or
[1:05:56] you know i get you know webs that come
[1:05:59] out of my wrists
[1:06:00] or you know i get cool things that
[1:06:03] happen
[1:06:04] when i decide i need this thing to
[1:06:07] happen
[1:06:08] and so i do it and i'm in control of
[1:06:11] this
[1:06:11] thing you know that that because i'm a
[1:06:14] superhero now
[1:06:16] and so i go do superhero things
[1:06:19] and so we begin to think like that's
[1:06:22] what it means to be
[1:06:23] a powerful christian that must be what
[1:06:25] the holy ghost is like is that
[1:06:27] i get to now that i'm filled with the
[1:06:29] holy ghost i get to go and you know poof
[1:06:31] and bang and different things am i
[1:06:34] talking to someone here
[1:06:35] or you all just thinking like this man
[1:06:37] is teaching blasphemies right now he's
[1:06:39] comparing the holy ghost
[1:06:40] to superheroes and if i'm sorry if that
[1:06:43] offends you
[1:06:44] i don't mean to do that but i'm trying
[1:06:45] like i'm trying to actually
[1:06:47] weave some culture into this message and
[1:06:49] show us like this is where we're at
[1:06:51] this is the kind of movies that young
[1:06:52] people and the old people and different
[1:06:54] people
[1:06:54] lots of people are watching
[1:06:58] unfortunately some are watching them
[1:07:00] even unfiltered which there's a lot of
[1:07:02] cussing in those movies i don't know if
[1:07:03] you knew that or not but
[1:07:05] i'm just saying
[1:07:10] so we began to think of the holy ghost
[1:07:12] like a superhero and then then we then
[1:07:14] we're totally ineffective and we can't
[1:07:15] do
[1:07:16] anything because
[1:07:19] we got the picture all skewed because
[1:07:22] when it comes to the holy ghost you
[1:07:23] don't get to control it it's not some
[1:07:25] power that comes on the inside of you
[1:07:26] that you get to weld and shoot something
[1:07:28] out of your staff or throw your hammer
[1:07:30] or make things happen that don't work
[1:07:31] like that
[1:07:32] it works because you yield it works
[1:07:34] because you give him control
[1:07:36] it works because you recognize i'm not
[1:07:38] just some you know
[1:07:40] scientific experiment gone wrong and got
[1:07:41] hit with some yellow goo
[1:07:43] or something like that but it works
[1:07:45] because actually i
[1:07:46] i repented and said god i'm nothing and
[1:07:49] i need you
[1:07:51] and he said okay i can work with that
[1:07:55] and you stay there stay in that you i
[1:07:57] need you
[1:07:58] god area stay right there cause i can
[1:08:02] work with someone who's saying i
[1:08:04] need you and isn't that what god was
[1:08:08] telling me
[1:08:08] get back to i need you
[1:08:12] on your knees trevor why do you wait two
[1:08:15] and three years to do this why don't you
[1:08:17] just get on your knees
[1:08:18] and start yielding yourself do you know
[1:08:20] why we don't pray
[1:08:22] sometimes we don't pray because we don't
[1:08:23] have faith we just really like well
[1:08:25] what's it gonna do
[1:08:26] yeah is he really there is he really
[1:08:28] gonna hear
[1:08:29] yeah yeah he will but a lot of times we
[1:08:33] don't pray we don't get on our knees
[1:08:34] we'll pray in almost any other
[1:08:36] any other position than actually on our
[1:08:37] knees like i don't know if that's just
[1:08:38] i'm just preaching me
[1:08:39] like this is my life i kind of i
[1:08:42] preached this at our church
[1:08:43] and this one brother was like yeah right
[1:08:45] he ain't preaching about himself he's
[1:08:46] talking about me
[1:08:47] so i just kind of realized that i'm
[1:08:49] probably not all that strange but you
[1:08:52] know why else we don't pray
[1:08:54] because we like control and if you're
[1:08:56] gonna pray properly
[1:08:58] you know what it means when you do this
[1:09:02] in front of someone and bow your head
[1:09:05] yielding
[1:09:06] submission you have the control
[1:09:10] man it's 20 21. what are you talking
[1:09:12] about who does that
[1:09:14] who gives control to anyone no i am i
[1:09:17] i am an american i am man
[1:09:20] i am me i have self-esteem
[1:09:24] i can be whatever i want to be yeah
[1:09:28] sure amen you can be
[1:09:31] but that's not what god wants you to be
[1:09:34] god wants you to submit god wants you to
[1:09:36] heal amen
[1:09:38] how are we going to prove this my slide
[1:09:40] is gone but how are we going to prove it
[1:09:42] how are we going to prove how how are we
[1:09:44] going to find ourselves in a condition
[1:09:46] that we can we can truly make it
[1:09:48] manifest to the people
[1:09:50] and prove it to them how we gonna do
[1:09:53] that
[1:09:54] how are you gonna are you doing that in
[1:09:56] your life now
[1:09:57] like i hope you are at times it it
[1:09:59] happens that god uses me
[1:10:02] you know sometimes there's there's
[1:10:03] x-rays that had cancer and then we
[1:10:05] prayed and that there isn't any more
[1:10:06] yeah
[1:10:09] take that atheist unexplained natural
[1:10:12] phenomenon yeah
[1:10:13] yeah that happens awful lot sometimes
[1:10:16] there's just too many coincidences and
[1:10:18] it's like oh maybe actually the bible's
[1:10:19] just true
[1:10:21] it is true and when you get into the
[1:10:24] channel
[1:10:24] when you do as it says and you take the
[1:10:26] word
[1:10:28] show the people what it says and you
[1:10:29] make it manifest how you do that by
[1:10:31] actually living it taking the word
[1:10:33] showing the people what it says not
[1:10:36] showing the here look see what it says
[1:10:37] mother see see
[1:10:38] no no see what the word says
[1:10:43] see what the word does read it
[1:10:46] right here this ain't arrogance
[1:10:50] this is a vessel for almighty god
[1:10:55] amen so we want to prove it well how we
[1:10:57] how are we going to prove it
[1:11:00] i struck man this one hit me
[1:11:04] and i'll just tell you a little more of
[1:11:06] the testimony that of of what i've been
[1:11:08] dealing with and what i've gone through
[1:11:09] over the last
[1:11:10] about five months um september 16th
[1:11:14] about a week i had been having i had had
[1:11:16] this tightness in just in my upper back
[1:11:18] and it was just it's happened before and
[1:11:20] you know about a week later it'll it'll
[1:11:22] go away and
[1:11:23] and i decided man i am so tight this
[1:11:25] morning oh i just
[1:11:26] so i felt like i just need to stretch
[1:11:28] and i started stretching
[1:11:30] and this muscle right here that cramped
[1:11:33] you know i don't know if you ever played
[1:11:34] soccer and you cramp or football or
[1:11:35] something like that you get a cramp what
[1:11:36] do you do you have one of your buddies
[1:11:37] grab your leg and start pushing and
[1:11:39] you're just sitting there going hahaha
[1:11:40] that feels good but it's good
[1:11:42] you know like just do it it's coming
[1:11:45] you know nobody can that muscle like you
[1:11:47] can't somebody stretch me like it
[1:11:49] it don't work but i still pounded on the
[1:11:52] floor going
[1:11:54] this hurts like man this hurts
[1:11:58] and i didn't know it at the time but
[1:12:00] what it was is i had ruptured somehow at
[1:12:02] some point in time i don't know if it
[1:12:03] happened then
[1:12:03] at that moment or when it happened but i
[1:12:05] had ruptured the disc between c6 and c7
[1:12:08] which is the last two in
[1:12:09] vertebrae in the base of your neck you
[1:12:12] say brother trevor you're 41 you're too
[1:12:13] young for that hey
[1:12:15] man yeah yeah what'd you do nothing cool
[1:12:18] apparently i have no idea
[1:12:20] i wish it would have been doing
[1:12:22] something cool but
[1:12:23] you know at least skiing i don't know
[1:12:25] something but no no i'm just
[1:12:27] laying on the floor stretching and
[1:12:30] i'm in serious pain i don't know if
[1:12:33] anybody's ever dealt with that kind of
[1:12:34] thing if you've ever had a ruptured disc
[1:12:35] in your back but
[1:12:37] there's some nods there's some amens
[1:12:41] that was the start of chronic pain for
[1:12:44] the next five months
[1:12:45] i didn't know what that was like i knew
[1:12:47] that the lord was probably using this to
[1:12:49] teach me something so i told the
[1:12:50] brothers i said you know
[1:12:51] maybe this is just the lord teaching me
[1:12:53] empathy i just hope i learn that lesson
[1:12:55] real quick
[1:12:57] problem is is you can't learn empathy
[1:12:59] for someone who has chronic pain real
[1:13:00] quick
[1:13:01] that don't work
[1:13:04] it takes about five months to learn that
[1:13:06] lesson
[1:13:07] but that's not the only lesson god
[1:13:08] wanted to teach me
[1:13:11] he wanted to teach me some other things
[1:13:13] one of them deals with this right here
[1:13:16] because i you know first i thought oh
[1:13:18] it's muscles it's this and finally okay
[1:13:20] let's go get an mri and got an mri
[1:13:23] okay it's your it's your spot or it's
[1:13:26] your base of your neck but we were doing
[1:13:28] your upper back so now we got to send
[1:13:29] you and get you another mri
[1:13:31] in your neck so we can make sure that
[1:13:33] that's all good thanks that's nice
[1:13:34] another two weeks before we can actually
[1:13:35] figure out what's totally wrong here
[1:13:38] two weeks and then like okay and then
[1:13:39] now you need to have an appointment with
[1:13:40] a spine doctor see what they're gonna
[1:13:42] say but by the way you know you probably
[1:13:43] you know we're gonna try to not have
[1:13:45] surgery okay
[1:13:46] that's nice all right so let's start
[1:13:47] doing physical therapy if i'm not going
[1:13:48] to do surgery it's going to be physical
[1:13:49] therapy that's just the only other
[1:13:51] option
[1:13:51] so i start doing physical therapy and
[1:13:53] you know and i'm a good boy like i do my
[1:13:55] physical therapy and i do it
[1:13:57] religiously and you know if i felt like
[1:13:58] i could get over it
[1:14:00] faster by doing three times the physical
[1:14:02] therapy hey sign me up man
[1:14:04] i'm done with this pain about about
[1:14:07] middle of december two three months into
[1:14:09] it you know i was telling a brother i
[1:14:10] said man
[1:14:12] i said if they tell me that i need
[1:14:14] surgery i'm just like
[1:14:15] i hurt so bad right now i'm just gonna
[1:14:18] say when tomorrow

[1:14:46] and wears you down and every day day
[1:14:49] after day after day
[1:14:50] it's still there you know you put icy
[1:14:53] hot on to go to sleep
[1:14:54] so that you can focus on the burning
[1:14:56] more than the pain
[1:14:58] because that's a bit more comfortable
[1:14:59] that's weird man it's like oh good it
[1:15:02] feels
[1:15:02] you know it burns so good like yes

[1:15:06] said no one except for those in chronic
[1:15:08] pain like
[1:15:10] that's terrible that's a terrible way to
[1:15:11] live and you wake up and it's still
[1:15:12] there and you go to bed and it's still
[1:15:14] there and every day
[1:15:15] it's there and it's there and it's there

[1:15:30] trying to get
[1:15:31] you to understand like where i was at

[1:16:18] anti-inflammatory injected right into
[1:16:20] your
[1:16:20] into your spine where you need
[1:16:22] anti-inflammatory so things will shrink
[1:16:23] back because they're swollen okay well
[1:16:25] that maybe sounds alright that
[1:16:26] i mean i don't know about having
[1:16:27] somebody put a needle in my spine that
[1:16:29] doesn't sound so great but hey if it's

[1:16:52] coming and because i was
[1:16:54] really hoping the doctors were just
[1:16:55] going to help me take care of this
[1:16:57] because i believe that jesus could
[1:16:58] heal me but but he wasn't
[1:17:05] that's hard like lord i know you can do
[1:17:07] this i don't know why you're not

[1:17:16] you're not taking it away so um
[1:17:18] i won't do what the doctor says because
[1:17:19] that's what prophet says do but i really

[1:17:24] and so i went to this appointment
[1:17:26] like yay they you know sent over my
[1:17:28] stuff from the spine doctor because i
[1:17:30] set it up through him and so they should
[1:17:31] have all my documentation okay here i am

[1:18:18] appointment
[1:18:20] i get to wait one more let me give you a
[1:18:22] little back story so
[1:18:24] i would say maybe two weeks prior to
[1:18:25] this appointment
[1:18:27] i was just in prayer on sunday morning
[1:18:28] sitting there in the pew
[1:18:30] and i just cried i was crying out to god
[1:18:31] i said god i can't do this
[1:18:34] this hurts and i mean i'm just you know
[1:18:36] i didn't even have a hanky that day
[1:18:38] and and i'm just i'm drowning in my own
[1:18:41] tears i'm i'm just like god
[1:18:42] i know you can heal me i don't know why
[1:18:45] you're not
[1:18:47] obviously i need more faith but god i
[1:18:49] don't know how to have more faith
[1:18:51] what do i do god like i don't i honestly
[1:18:52] god i don't know how to have more faith

[1:18:57] services were hard our
[1:18:59] our pews were just not tall enough i
[1:19:01] needed just
[1:19:02] four more inches so i could really just
[1:19:04] put my back against something to support
[1:19:06] it
[1:19:07] and just man services would be painful
[1:19:09] it would be just rough but

[1:19:12] i'm i'm going to church right you know

[1:21:58] other day that i don't know how to have
[1:22:00] more faith and the conversation was
[1:22:02] pretty much over because i was crying
[1:22:04] and i couldn't talk anymore
[1:22:07] and so we ended the call and i'm like
[1:22:11] i'm just gonna sit here for eight days
[1:22:12] and wait for a shot i guess
[1:22:15] but man that just rung in my ears and i
[1:22:17] was like
[1:22:18] i know i i know i should confess the
[1:22:20] word of god more i know i should be
[1:22:22] better about this because i'm i'm kind
[1:22:25] of bad about it actually
[1:22:26] so i started reading that little book
[1:22:28] brother george smith put out the healing
[1:22:29] thoughts book
[1:22:30] and i started reading it man and i just
[1:22:32] started getting spiritual spanking after
[1:22:34] spiritual spanking
[1:22:35] me this preacher up here was getting
[1:22:38] spiritually spanked don't worry
[1:22:40] you know we're just men and men just
[1:22:42] like you
[1:22:44] i'm just a brother with a gift i'm no
[1:22:46] different than you
[1:22:47] none of these brothers are different
[1:22:49] they're just brothers with gifts you
[1:22:50] have gift we have a gift it's just
[1:22:52] this one happens to be up in front it's
[1:22:55] all
[1:22:55] so i'm getting spiritual spank you know
[1:22:58] try believing the word of god try
[1:22:59] believing the word of god try actually
[1:23:00] confessing it like you meant it try
[1:23:02] actually you know hey
[1:23:03] try actually recognizing god is not a
[1:23:04] god of history but he's the god of i am
[1:23:06] and he's more you know and the word of
[1:23:08] god the promise of god is actually more
[1:23:10] real than your pain
[1:23:12] amen and that's what god started
[1:23:15] teaching me over the next three days
[1:23:17] and i actually started confessing the
[1:23:18] word of god and confessing the word of
[1:23:21] god
[1:23:21] and like i meant it i still got the shot
[1:23:25] i got the second one too probably get
[1:23:28] the third one in a couple of weeks but
[1:23:30] don't worry i feel a lot better was it
[1:23:33] the shot brother trevor
[1:23:34] was it confessing the word of god well
[1:23:36] probably a little bit of both actually
[1:23:38] i'm not ashamed of that but i actually
[1:23:40] started confessing the word of god and i
[1:23:42] and i began to think about it and you
[1:23:43] know what actually you know when you
[1:23:45] take the word
[1:23:46] and what it says and show people what it
[1:23:48] says and make it manifest to them and i
[1:23:49] began to think you know there was this
[1:23:50] man by the name of john ryan
[1:23:52] you know he couldn't who couldn't see he
[1:23:54] was a catholic boy
[1:23:55] he didn't even know how to have faith
[1:23:57] man and he just and brother branham said
[1:23:59] hey confess the word of god
[1:24:01] you said you believe me go confess it
[1:24:03] extra extra praise god for healing me
[1:24:05] until finally he finds himself in a
[1:24:07] barber chair to get a shave
[1:24:09] and they begin to make fun of him and he
[1:24:11] says that's right praise god for healing
[1:24:13] me and what happened
[1:24:15] he took the word of god what it says and
[1:24:17] he showed the people what it says
[1:24:19] and he manifested it to him guess what
[1:24:22] john ryan did to the barber
[1:24:24] i don't know if the barber was an
[1:24:25] atheist a skeptic or whatever he was
[1:24:28] but the word of god was absolutely
[1:24:30] proven to that man
[1:24:32] through the life of john ryan i begin to
[1:24:36] think god i will
[1:24:37] that's yes sign me up for that god
[1:24:41] i want to believe the word of god like
[1:24:43] that i want to confess the word of god
[1:24:45] like that
[1:24:46] confess it like i actually believe it's
[1:24:48] true
[1:24:49] pray like i actually believe that i'm
[1:24:51] talking to someone when i pray
[1:24:53] pray like i actually believe that
[1:24:56] someone will speak to my heart amen
[1:24:58] amen because i'm a christian
[1:25:02] because i believe the word of god
[1:25:04] because i'm going to manifest and preach
[1:25:07] the gospel
[1:25:08] which means that jesus christ is alive
[1:25:10] and well today
[1:25:12] in me and i don't have to deal with it
[1:25:16] maybe i got to deal with this pain but i
[1:25:17] got a promise that's better than the
[1:25:19] pain
[1:25:20] that tells me even when it hurts i'm
[1:25:22] real
[1:25:23] and if you and if you're hurting it's
[1:25:25] because i'm putting you through this for
[1:25:26] a purpose
[1:25:27] because you don't have enough faith and
[1:25:30] you need a brother to come
[1:25:31] tell you break you down a couple of pegs
[1:25:33] and show you you don't have that faith
[1:25:35] let him annoy you
[1:25:37] okay thanks lord thanks
[1:25:41] appreciate it
[1:25:44] because it slapped me into reality
[1:25:46] what's reality the promise
[1:25:48] the promise the promise now
[1:25:51] well let's see here i just wanted to go
[1:25:56] because we talked about superheroes and
[1:25:58] and then i'm then i moved on from that i
[1:26:00] don't know maybe
[1:26:01] so this is out of the lesson 35 and 36
[1:26:05] from the church age book and i just
[1:26:06] wanted to go through this as we talked
[1:26:08] about
[1:26:09] the superhero thing because that's what
[1:26:10] we're talking about is is manifesting
[1:26:12] like a power
[1:26:13] that is not you being manifested so
[1:26:15] that's kind of like a superhero and we
[1:26:17] get that wrong so
[1:26:18] so so back in the days of nimrod
[1:26:22] and and this is this is the genesis 3 15
[1:26:25] is the first prophecy
[1:26:29] of the coming messiah in scripture i
[1:26:32] will put enmity between thee and the
[1:26:34] woman and between thy seed and her seed
[1:26:36] what was her seed
[1:26:36] the coming messiah it shall bruise thy
[1:26:38] head thou shalt bruise
[1:26:40] his heel and they understood that the
[1:26:43] symbol here they understood what this
[1:26:44] meant
[1:26:45] that when it talked about his heel being
[1:26:47] bruised that it likely meant
[1:26:49] his death so what happened was
[1:26:52] is there was a there was a the next
[1:26:54] slide there was a similar
[1:26:55] polytheism that that started at the time
[1:26:58] of nimrod so they had this symbol of
[1:27:00] janus
[1:27:00] or cush or bell with his club so he was
[1:27:03] both the confuser
[1:27:05] and the interpreter of the gods he had
[1:27:07] two faces this
[1:27:08] this original kush which was nimrod's
[1:27:10] father who became the first god so to
[1:27:12] speak
[1:27:13] he was the interpreter and the confuser
[1:27:14] which doesn't make any sense wait
[1:27:16] if some if somebody's interpreting how
[1:27:17] is he confusing it well actually god
[1:27:19] confused it
[1:27:20] they tried to say that cush was the
[1:27:22] interpreter and god was confusing it but
[1:27:24] if god confuses the languages and cush
[1:27:26] is the interpreter
[1:27:28] then there's a god that's more powerful
[1:27:30] than kush so kush has to be the one
[1:27:32] that does it and you just have to live
[1:27:33] with it not making sense
[1:27:36] that's just paganism for you there you
[1:27:39] go and
[1:27:39] and and so he had a claw a club and see
[1:27:42] what he did with his club is he
[1:27:43] he smashed everything and confused the
[1:27:45] languages that's what that's what he did
[1:27:47] with his club so
[1:27:48] so there he was he's got two faces here
[1:27:52] and he's got a club
[1:27:55] that was this original god that started
[1:27:58] in this early early early
[1:28:00] paganism there at the tower of babel are
[1:28:01] we together we're just going back in
[1:28:03] time real fast
[1:28:04] bringing out this little point okay so
[1:28:06] we can go to the next side you know
[1:28:07] janice has a club i mean uh thor
[1:28:10] has a club um and and
[1:28:14] thor kills the serpent by hitting it in
[1:28:17] the head with his
[1:28:18] club like genesis 3 15 with
[1:28:23] it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[1:28:25] bruise its heel
[1:28:27] and the serpent kills thor during the
[1:28:30] same battle
[1:28:32] so my what's what is this
[1:28:35] this is nothing but a perversion of the
[1:28:38] messianic story
[1:28:41] so so as you're watching your marvel
[1:28:42] movie i just want you to understand that
[1:28:44] if you've watched that first thor movie
[1:28:46] which i watched just full disclosure it
[1:28:48] was so blatant
[1:28:50] so blatantly you know the bride you know
[1:28:54] the girl is behind him as he walks
[1:28:56] forward and sacrifices his life so he
[1:28:58] can save
[1:29:01] and then you know he rises like hello
[1:29:07] and we get excited about those stories
[1:29:08] but a lot of times we don't get excited
[1:29:09] about jesus christ
[1:29:11] hello church i mean something's wrong
[1:29:14] there
[1:29:14] right when we get excited about the
[1:29:16] perversion more than the reality
[1:29:18] so then so then the next slide we can
[1:29:20] look at just another one
[1:29:21] achilles who was the son of a god
[1:29:25] and how does achilles die
[1:29:28] but by getting shot in the heel
[1:29:33] why does achilles like who thought that
[1:29:35] up like why
[1:29:37] why is achilles why is his weak spot the
[1:29:39] heel genesis 3 15.
[1:29:42] i i could i could show you
[1:29:46] example after example that would just
[1:29:48] just blow your mind
[1:29:50] on all of all all of these superheroes
[1:29:54] and all of these stories and all of
[1:29:55] these
[1:29:55] different myths throughout every single
[1:29:57] culture in the world has these kinds of
[1:29:59] things
[1:29:59] they are perversions of genesis 3 15.
[1:30:02] and and things like their only weakness
[1:30:05] is the heal or they die in a healer they
[1:30:07] have a cert
[1:30:07] a battle with a great serpent at the end
[1:30:10] you know one of them even with even with
[1:30:13] thor
[1:30:14] is that is that he it's the midgard
[1:30:15] serpent that he that he
[1:30:17] ends up kills and by the way that
[1:30:18] apparently the thor movies like that
[1:30:20] they're not actually on the
[1:30:21] myth so if you think like well he has no
[1:30:23] idea what he's talking about no i
[1:30:25] actually know the myth
[1:30:26] not the movie quite as much but but one
[1:30:28] of them is
[1:30:29] he goes to find the midgard serpent and
[1:30:31] he's he's fishing for the serpent
[1:30:33] and as he's as he's got the serpent he's
[1:30:35] pulling it up
[1:30:36] his heel goes through the boat yeah
[1:30:41] chen is 3 15. the serpent's going to
[1:30:43] bruise his heel like
[1:30:44] it is just over and over and over again
[1:30:47] that you find these things
[1:30:49] so i just one of the reasons because i
[1:30:50] wanted to bring in this whole superhero
[1:30:52] idea because
[1:30:54] and and i wanted to show you these
[1:30:55] things is that that
[1:30:57] do not forget that maybe this seems
[1:31:00] innocent
[1:31:00] maybe it's not not that bad and we can
[1:31:03] watch it and that sort of thing and i'm
[1:31:05] not
[1:31:05] gonna stand here and be legalistic and
[1:31:07] tell you what you can and can't watch
[1:31:09] and all of those things even though i
[1:31:10] told you all the closure netflix
[1:31:11] accounts this morning
[1:31:13] but all right like
[1:31:16] be spirit-led okay be spirit-led but as
[1:31:19] you're being spirit-led make sure that
[1:31:20] you
[1:31:20] understand that the devil would like to
[1:31:23] get in these things in his various ways
[1:31:25] to pervert it without your knowledge
[1:31:28] to where then you're in prayer going god
[1:31:31] i i need like i need the power to just
[1:31:33] you know i i need you know i need the
[1:31:37] the young lady with the vial of you know
[1:31:39] juice to pour in my
[1:31:40] in my lips so that my back will get
[1:31:42] healed like where's that lord
[1:31:45] well nowhere believe the word of god
[1:31:48] amen
[1:31:49] because that's the power amen faith in
[1:31:51] the word of god that's the power
[1:31:52] and we get these ideas of where the
[1:31:54] power comes from you know
[1:31:55] because you know what else is you know
[1:31:57] getting a shot in your neck and you know
[1:31:59] this just comes to me just you know but
[1:32:00] am i wait you know is the shot in my
[1:32:02] neck the girl with the little
[1:32:03] vial of super juice because i tell you
[1:32:06] what when i'm sitting there in bed
[1:32:07] after my first shot and i'm still in
[1:32:09] pain but the first shot helped
[1:32:11] and i was about a week later i'm like oh
[1:32:13] man i can't wait for that next shot
[1:32:17] i'm just being honest and i realized
[1:32:21] dear lord i am just what am i a druggie
[1:32:24] like i can't wait for this next shot why
[1:32:27] why am i
[1:32:28] why is my mind sitting here going i
[1:32:30] can't wait for the next shot
[1:32:32] when i have the god of all the power all
[1:32:34] the power in the universe
[1:32:36] is my friend and lives inside of me
[1:32:41] so why am i sitting here going i can't
[1:32:42] wait for the next shot oh my goodness
[1:32:44] like no why am i not saying god thank
[1:32:47] you
[1:32:51] is he not more real than the shot is
[1:32:53] here isn't he
[1:32:54] where's your faith is he or isn't he and
[1:32:56] that's what god is teaching me in pain
[1:32:58] laying down flat on my back going
[1:33:00] what do you actually believe i put you
[1:33:03] through this and now you're
[1:33:04] now it's coming to a place where you've
[1:33:05] got to manifest and it's not about
[1:33:08] all of these things it's not about how
[1:33:10] you might see these things or how it
[1:33:11] might be skewed
[1:33:12] but it's actually the word of god stands
[1:33:14] true and do you have faith in it
[1:33:16] and if you have faith in it why aren't
[1:33:18] you why is your mind
[1:33:20] not getting to a place where it is you
[1:33:22] know like the quote that says the right
[1:33:25] mental attitude
[1:33:26] towards any divine promise of god will
[1:33:28] bring it to pass
[1:33:29] why because the right and mental
[1:33:31] attitude can stem from the right
[1:33:34] understanding the right heart that says
[1:33:36] god your word is true
[1:33:38] come what may it doesn't matter what the
[1:33:40] symptoms say
[1:33:41] your word is truth
[1:33:45] and that's where it's at
[1:33:51] so unfortunately all these superheroes
[1:33:54] and all these different things
[1:33:56] they've gotten our ideas skewed on on
[1:33:58] truly what it means to have faith
[1:34:00] it's not a superhero faith but it's a
[1:34:02] faith in just the word
[1:34:04] of god it's a faith in the truth brother
[1:34:06] ryan says what if i go out here tonight
[1:34:08] and say see
[1:34:08] say i see the moon shining what are you
[1:34:10] shining about moon and the moon would
[1:34:11] say it's not me shining it's the sun
[1:34:13] shining on me that's what it is
[1:34:14] if you live close enough to god so the
[1:34:16] power of the holy spirit can fall on you
[1:34:18] it'll reflect the presence of god amen
[1:34:24] and my angel shall go before thee from
[1:34:25] 1953 brother branham says now he gave us
[1:34:28] the strongest weapon that there is in
[1:34:30] all the world and that's prayer
[1:34:32] prayer is what changes things the
[1:34:34] christian doesn't realize what a force
[1:34:35] he has when he kneels on his knees
[1:34:37] before the almighty god in the name of
[1:34:39] jesus christ
[1:34:40] he doesn't realize what a power that is
[1:34:44] if the people could only realize that
[1:34:46] what is given right unto them
[1:34:48] anything that you ask for will be given
[1:34:50] if you can appropriate the faith to
[1:34:52] believe it
[1:34:52] for god's word is true so if it comes
[1:34:55] out if it's a promise out of the word of
[1:34:57] god
[1:34:57] if you can just appropriate the faith to
[1:35:00] believe it and ask god
[1:35:01] for it you don't realize the power that
[1:35:04] you have
[1:35:06] why part of it is you set the mark too
[1:35:08] low
[1:35:09] we stopped right
[1:35:13] but today we're preaching the gospel
[1:35:16] power of the gospel that proves the
[1:35:19] gospel because it lives this is what i
[1:35:21] want in my life
[1:35:22] i want my life to preach the gospel i
[1:35:25] want my life
[1:35:26] to manifest the gospel and and and
[1:35:29] and so why wouldn't i get into prayer to
[1:35:31] get closer to the one
[1:35:32] to get myself so i can reflect him in
[1:35:35] the way that he ought to be reflected oh
[1:35:37] my goodness that's what i've got to have
[1:35:39] i need it i want to have it and and if
[1:35:41] prayer is the ticket to get there
[1:35:43] yeah amen i'll do that because it's
[1:35:46] important like because it's time
[1:35:48] church it's time to rise it it's it's we
[1:35:51] did what are we saying this morning um
[1:35:53] let the worshiper arise
[1:35:57] it's time to arise church we're living
[1:35:59] in the last days
[1:36:00] going home it's just around the corner
[1:36:02] there's there's a short quick work to be
[1:36:04] done
[1:36:04] and you're part of it you're a part of
[1:36:06] the final voice to the final age
[1:36:08] so let's get in prayer let's get to a
[1:36:09] pla let's let's sell it out and then
[1:36:11] let's go
[1:36:13] like status quo isn't working
[1:36:19] what a power and a privilege has been
[1:36:20] given to the church of the living god
[1:36:22] when you fall to your knees in prayer
[1:36:24] even the devils tremble to the weakest
[1:36:26] of them
[1:36:27] think of it i've seen a poor woman here
[1:36:29] some time ago that she was so yielded to
[1:36:31] the wrong spirit
[1:36:32] till it throwed her on her back and her
[1:36:33] feet was up like that
[1:36:35] she crawled on her back like a snake and
[1:36:36] she didn't know nothing about it for two
[1:36:38] years
[1:36:41] he's in an insane institution he sees
[1:36:42] this they come to pray for
[1:36:44] and and brother branham's like oh my
[1:36:45] goodness you know and he's he's thinking
[1:36:47] well
[1:36:48] you know brother brandon like i'm gonna
[1:36:50] pray for this girl
[1:36:51] and he reaches his hand out and he's
[1:36:52] like don't do that brother branham
[1:36:54] he's like well you know i got the power
[1:36:56] of god right like i'm gonna pray for
[1:36:57] this woman i'm gonna
[1:36:58] i gotta lay my hand on her and she like
[1:37:00] threw him across the room and hid it in
[1:37:02] into a wall
[1:37:05] so here's this woman so yielded
[1:37:09] so powerful because of her yielding to
[1:37:12] the wrong thing
[1:37:13] that she's she's she's on her back like
[1:37:16] this and she's
[1:37:17] she's slithering like a snake along the
[1:37:20] floor
[1:37:21] that's how yielded this woman i hope i
[1:37:24] got my
[1:37:25] mic here's still working that's how
[1:37:26] yielded this woman is to the wrong
[1:37:28] spirit
[1:37:30] how powerful this woman has come because
[1:37:32] of her ultimate her absolute yielding to
[1:37:34] the wrong spirit
[1:37:35] no doubt that that was a i don't know
[1:37:37] what kind of spirit that was i don't
[1:37:38] know what she must have done
[1:37:40] to put herself in that position but i
[1:37:41] bet you she thought she was going to
[1:37:43] enjoy it a whole lot more than she did
[1:37:46] but how much more when we're yielded
[1:37:50] like if a woman can be that powerful and
[1:37:53] that that yielded to be that crazy
[1:37:55] to to go along the floor on a snake and
[1:37:57] throw brother branham across the room
[1:38:01] how about if you're yielded to the right
[1:38:02] thing man
[1:38:05] i guarantee you you're not gonna crawl
[1:38:06] on your back not like a snake you're
[1:38:08] gonna be in your right mind
[1:38:10] you're gonna be happy
[1:38:17] and what kind of power well maybe
[1:38:18] probably not the power where
[1:38:20] prophet grabs your hand and you throw
[1:38:21] them across the room probably not that
[1:38:23] kind of power
[1:38:25] but the power to prove that god is alive
[1:38:28] and well
[1:38:30] a better power than one that throws
[1:38:32] somebody across the room
[1:38:34] man i'll take that that sounds nice sign
[1:38:37] me up for that lord okay
[1:38:39] how am i gonna get that yield yield to
[1:38:42] the holy spirit how am i gonna
[1:38:44] what's what's the best way i know to
[1:38:45] yield
[1:38:48] that's the best way i know to yield and
[1:38:51] god has been trying to tell me that for
[1:38:53] two or three years
[1:38:54] and i finally started three or four
[1:38:56] weeks ago
[1:38:59] church i think that's what god's calling
[1:39:00] us to do is yield better yeah
[1:39:02] brother nathan at our church has been
[1:39:04] preaching the series on yield we're on
[1:39:05] part 85
[1:39:07] kind of waiting for the church to get it
[1:39:08] so we could move on to a different
[1:39:10] series
[1:39:12] yield how are we going to do that well
[1:39:16] maybe we should start maybe just just
[1:39:18] just can you do something for me

[1:39:55] time

[1:39:58] that you can yield to christ so that you
[1:40:00] can have more power in your life

[1:40:14] can we be more sincere can we begin god
[1:40:16] is
[1:40:18] god's desiring us to be more sincere

[1:40:22] to give us this kind of power in our
[1:40:23] lives

[1:40:28] the message be pushed around
[1:40:30] and let let blasphemy blast beamers go
[1:40:33] and let
[1:40:33] let families question and not sure this
[1:40:36] is that or whatever
[1:40:37] like no it should be plainly obvious
[1:40:40] when you come into this church
[1:40:41] that that jesus christ is alive and well
[1:40:45] that this message is nothing but the
[1:40:48] truth
[1:40:50] why because he lives and reigns in the
[1:40:52] hearts of the believers
[1:40:53] and it's not like that's not just what
[1:40:56] like
[1:40:57] that's not just an evangelical
[1:41:00] saying it's a manifested reality
[1:41:04] that proves that god is real
