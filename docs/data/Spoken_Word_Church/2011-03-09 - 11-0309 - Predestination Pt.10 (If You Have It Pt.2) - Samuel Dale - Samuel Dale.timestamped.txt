[35:30] and let your lips the lips of natural

[36:16] now as we read your word you come and
[36:18] speak to our hearts and our lives
[36:20] forgive our sins most of all because we
[36:22] want to stand complete in you and just
[36:25] have your way tonight in Jesus name amen
[36:32] amen we're in Ephesians 1
[36:35] verse3 blessed be the God and father of
[36:38] our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed
[36:40] us with all spiritual blessings in
[36:42] Heavenly places in Christ and notice
[36:45] it's in Christ it's not in me in you
[36:47] that's right there's not too much
[36:48] Heavenly in us it's all in him amen
[36:50] according as he had chosen Us in him
[36:52] before the foundation of the world that
[36:54] we should be holy and Without Blame
[36:55] before him in love having predestinated
[36:59] us unto the adoption of children by
[37:01] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[37:03] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[37:06] of the glory of his grace wherein he
[37:09] hath made us accepted into beloved in
[37:12] whom we have Redemption through his
[37:13] blood the Forgiveness of sins according
[37:16] to the riches of his grace wherein Heath
[37:18] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[37:20] Prudence having made known unto us the
[37:22] mystery of his will according to his
[37:25] good pleasure which he had purposed in
[37:27] him himself now there's a mystery there
[37:29] see and it's Redemption and he's
[37:32] purposed everything inin himself that in
[37:35] the dispensation of the fullness of time
[37:37] he might gather together in one all
[37:39] things in Christ both which are in
[37:41] heaven and which are on earth even in
[37:43] him in whom also we have obtained an
[37:45] inheritance being predestinated
[37:47] according to the purpose of him who
[37:49] worketh all things after the counsil of
[37:51] his own will that we should be to the
[37:53] praise of his glory who first trusted in
[37:57] Christ now if you go to
[38:01] Matthew
[38:04] 19 we'll just read one verse verse
[38:10] 16 this is the Rich Young Ruler you know
[38:12] in the story and behold one came and
[38:15] said unto him good Master what good
[38:18] thing shall I
[38:20] do that I may have eternal life you may
[38:24] be seated the Lord at his Blessing to
[38:26] the re of the word
[38:31] now we've been trying to get down to a
[38:35] place to get an understanding we've been
[38:38] talking on predestination now for a few
[38:41] weeks you know and
[38:43] that's it's not like mankind I hope that
[38:47] that's at least uh been enough to dwell
[38:50] within your mind to be able to see the
[38:53] scriptures unfold because predestination
[38:56] has been a a kind of a sore thumb as you
[39:00] would call it in the religious realm
[39:03] because of the way people believe you
[39:05] know and it's because of what they've
[39:07] been taught you know I mean we've been
[39:09] taught all of our life this is our right
[39:12] hand well how do you know you know see
[39:17] this may be
[39:18] it see I may be looking
[39:22] backwards see we you know we we we we
[39:25] measure a horse so many hands whose
[39:28] hands I mean you get a hold of somebody
[39:31] with big hands you know it measures out
[39:34] difference you know but it's it's I know
[39:36] what it is it's a it's a measurement
[39:38] it's a comparison and things but the
[39:40] point I'm getting at is we we believe
[39:43] what
[39:43] we basically have been taught all of our
[39:46] life on something and we don't really uh
[39:50] get down into considering in the
[39:53] scriptures and things what God is really
[39:55] maybe saying on a subject and you know
[39:57] and so we come up with with an idea like
[40:00] what mama said what daddy said or uncle
[40:03] or a and that's all right for the
[40:06] time because as we were trying to bring
[40:08] there Sunday you know the Bible says
[40:10] there in the book of Acts that it at one
[40:12] time God win at our ignorance that's
[40:14] right right you know CU we we didn't
[40:18] have no way of knowing right but we're
[40:21] supposed to be in the end time and
[40:23] supposed to be believing that God sent
[40:25] us a prophet down in the end time to be
[40:27] able to expound unto us the truth of the
[40:31] word of God and it's like I was telling
[40:33] somebody the other day about it they
[40:35] were working on a wiring system here and
[40:38] I told him I said uh you know Paul said
[40:40] follow me as I follow Christ right I
[40:42] said I follow you know people say well
[40:44] y'all follow a man I said well you're a
[40:46] Baptist I said John Smith started your
[40:49] church you know and uh I just give him a
[40:52] quick run to I said because you know I
[40:54] was there and knew what not there when
[40:56] it started but there in it I knew the
[40:59] doctrine of things and see we just
[41:01] accept a lot of times what people say
[41:04] right instead of studying the Bible for
[41:06] ourselves right you know people are say
[41:09] well the Bible said you know in the end
[41:12] time you can't tell the difference in
[41:14] the in the seasons except the budding of
[41:17] the trees and the shedding of the leaves
[41:18] well that is the difference I mean that
[41:21] is what it is but you go to some places
[41:24] and they don't shed their leaves but see
[41:27] that's not in the scripture right
[41:29] because it said they would be seed time
[41:31] and harvest yep until the end of all
[41:34] things you know would to be brought well
[41:36] see then we take one that you know said
[41:38] every tub was set on its own bottom I
[41:39] never did understand what they meant
[41:41] about that but they claimed it was in
[41:43] the Bible Well I I've I've studied it
[41:45] with the computer and all of the things
[41:47] and running words and I've never found
[41:48] that you know it was what somebody said
[41:52] right you know and people will tell you
[41:54] well the Bible says it I read
[41:58] well you know I'm not going to argue
[42:01] with you about it I'm just going to say
[42:04] come and show me right because I want to
[42:07] stay with what the word says and then I
[42:09] don't have to worry about the rest
[42:11] everything else will be taken care of if
[42:13] I just stay with what the word has to
[42:15] say about it and you know as I was
[42:17] saying there last this past
[42:20] Sunday you know that mankind has always
[42:23] anytime in the Bible that you see him
[42:25] the Rich Young Ruler came
[42:27] uh Nicodemus came uh you know wanting to
[42:31] talk to to Jesus
[42:34] about you know what to do right you know
[42:40] and uh it was always in there you know
[42:42] what must we do like the the Jailer
[42:44] there that with Paul and I believe it
[42:46] was Silas wasn't it in the book of Acts
[42:47] that were in jail and the Lord delivered
[42:50] them right and and and you know and that
[42:53] day if if you know if you lost a
[42:56] prisoner you you brothers that was in
[42:58] the military you know if you lost a
[43:00] prisoner that you were holding you you
[43:01] you took his place you know it was just
[43:04] a way they said it you know and so he
[43:06] was ready to kill
[43:08] his but when they said well hey wait a
[43:10] minute we're not gone we're still here
[43:12] well then he changed his mind he didn't
[43:14] give a ho what the government said about
[43:16] going to kill him he he said you know
[43:18] what can I do to be saved right well
[43:21] it's always been within mankind to
[43:24] desire the old Indian hunt with a Happy
[43:27] Hunting Ground you know this religion
[43:29] even all
[43:31] religions have a uh life after death
[43:34] whether it be Muslim Buddha Hindu
[43:36] whatever it be you know whatever you
[43:38] come in you you have that and you have a
[43:40] belief in God it may not be the true God
[43:43] but you'll have a belief in a totem pole
[43:46] or or some form or P you know something
[43:49] look like an animal or you know all kind
[43:51] of things and and that was really what
[43:53] Abraham was doing you know Abraham was
[43:56] making Idols to sell them right cuz them
[44:00] people back there they they just wanted
[44:02] to you know they wanted some kind of an
[44:04] idol would he just make them what he
[44:06] wanted because his his daddy was in on
[44:08] it you or daddy-in-law there he was in
[44:10] on making them and all but one day see
[44:14] that God come and touched Abraham well
[44:17] he wasn't in the idol naked no more that
[44:20] kind of ended that once he had an
[44:22] experience with the lord well that's
[44:25] what I've been trying to get us to see
[44:26] we can talk about predestination we've
[44:28] been through it that God's forn
[44:32] knowledge if we don't believe that God
[44:35] fornew everything that would ever be in
[44:37] the world then what kind of a god do you
[44:40] got I mean I just go trade it off and
[44:42] get me a Buddha Hindu Muslim whatever
[44:44] I'm honest you know I mean I I wouldn't
[44:47] I I wouldn't if I'm not going to believe
[44:49] that God can keep his word correct and
[44:53] and run things rightly then I'm not
[44:54] going to believe in him that way I'm
[44:56] going to be I'm going to eat drink and
[44:58] be merry because I'm going to claim I'm
[45:01] going to the Happy Hunting Ground you
[45:02] know and like all this and the Muslims
[45:05] and things you know they they give him
[45:07] SE give a guy 70 virgins to go die in
[45:09] war you know they never did say what to
[45:11] give to women but you know I mean it
[45:14] just you
[45:15] know everybody's got some kind of an
[45:18] idea right everybody's got some concept
[45:21] about what it is and how you get it but
[45:26] see that's what what God was looking
[45:28] down through time to look at and see us
[45:31] and he judges us according to what we
[45:34] have heard of the truth right he doesn't
[45:37] judge us of what we've not heard no come
[45:40] on see you're not responsible for
[45:41] something you've not heard but you are
[45:43] responsible for what you have
[45:45] heard and that's why Jesus said You
[45:47] shall know the truth and the truth will
[45:50] set you free all right so then that's
[45:53] that puts the loadbearing back onto
[45:55] whether the word is true or not right a
[45:57] l then we look at as we said
[45:59] predestination and people say well if
[46:01] it's
[46:02] predetermined that I be lost will I just
[46:05] be lost I guess
[46:07] well if that's what you think about it
[46:11] what can God
[46:12] do you know if that's what you consider
[46:15] in yourself what can God do that's right
[46:17] how can he change anything that you've
[46:20] got your mind made
[46:22] up that's right all right but then
[46:25] people even believe you know that that
[46:27] we come into the world with eternal
[46:30] life well that's not a new doctrine this
[46:33] to the some of the people in the message
[46:34] that's been down through time of
[46:37] organized religion right and things
[46:40] that's come up with a lot of those
[46:41] things uh Baptist had it pretty close to
[46:44] that because they believed in eternal
[46:45] security you know once saved always
[46:48] saved and it didn't matter what you done
[46:50] you're still saved well I didn't believe
[46:51] that when I was the Baptist now I didn't
[46:54] cherish that idea back there right and I
[46:57] certainly don't today but I believe see
[46:59] that you must be born again amen when
[47:02] Nicodemus come to Jesus he didn't you
[47:04] know Jesus didn't say well now what you
[47:07] need to do now Nicodemus is just is just
[47:09] go confess what you believe no he was he
[47:13] was confessing he put his life on the
[47:14] line as I told you the other day his job
[47:16] was on the line what if they' have found
[47:18] him
[47:20] there he would have been man that would
[47:22] have been rough if those others had
[47:23] found him you know there but see once he
[47:27] faced the Lord Jesus the Lord Jesus gave
[47:29] him the key he said you must be born
[47:30] again right right well then Nicodemus
[47:34] come up with the idea and he said you
[47:35] mean I got to go back into my mother's
[47:37] womb and come out
[47:39] again and Jesus said now if I tell you
[47:41] of of Heaven Earthly things how can you
[47:44] understand Heaven if you can understand
[47:45] what it is here see and and he said you
[47:48] must be born again amen all right see
[47:51] you must be born from above the original
[47:55] translation says amen all right
[47:57] in other words you got to have a new
[47:58] birth right all right if we don't get
[48:00] nothing across tonight except one thing
[48:02] you get this point I believe that you
[48:06] must receive eternal life to have it
[48:08] that's right all right I believe in the
[48:11] representation of predestination yes
[48:14] that God
[48:16] fornew because like I said a moment ago
[48:18] if he doesn't know then what kind of a
[48:20] God is it that's right you know we don't
[48:23] we don't need to be serving him if he's
[48:24] not good enough to know or great enough
[48:26] to know
[48:27] but see you must be born again it's not
[48:29] something that you just say well you
[48:31] know I I'll do this or I'll do that and
[48:34] it certainly not built on Works Jesus
[48:36] didn't tell
[48:37] Nicodemus you know you go do this you go
[48:40] do that you do this and you do that he
[48:42] said I done that like the Rich Young
[48:43] Ruler said I've kept these all of my
[48:45] life right and Jesus loved him the
[48:48] scripture said you know why cuz he knew
[48:51] he' done it right he could look down in
[48:53] his life and he'd seen it he lived a
[48:55] good life right and see then it's always
[48:59] been what can I
[49:01] do now on the day of Pentecost when it
[49:04] come up there to Peter preaching the
[49:05] message he didn't say go do this and go
[49:08] do that or go do this or believe this or
[49:10] do that what did he
[49:13] say he gave the the uh uh uh you know
[49:17] the
[49:19] prescription to become Eternal right
[49:22] what repent everyone be baptized in the
[49:25] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[49:26] and you shall receive the gift of the
[49:28] Holy Ghost he told me exactly what to do
[49:31] all right see it's not what you can do
[49:33] or don't do that's
[49:36] fine Brother Dale you don't believe in
[49:38] living good no I told you that I don't
[49:40] believe in living good I believe in
[49:42] getting born again and letting God live
[49:43] out of it then if I don't live a life
[49:47] you know right of Christ then I'm not a
[49:50] Christian right that's no problem is it
[49:53] that's right if I don't live a life then
[49:56] I'm not a Christian that's you know as
[49:58] the old saying is you see a fox you see
[50:01] a hole and you see a fox tail sticking
[50:02] out it's a pretty good sound you got a
[50:03] fox in the den you know if his tail
[50:06] sticking out well if I go out and live
[50:08] like the devil all week long that was
[50:10] what they were amazed at was when I
[50:12] worked at J Motors are with about six or
[50:14] seven of you and and they said well you
[50:16] know you know you know you work with
[50:19] your church here a lot of them you
[50:21] remember what I told him I said well ask
[50:23] them am I any
[50:25] different ask them am I I any different
[50:27] when I'm at work than I am at church
[50:30] amen I've been hunting and fishing with
[50:32] a lot of you am I any
[50:34] different when I'm at doing those things
[50:37] and I am at church no because that's
[50:41] what I want to be right I don't have to
[50:43] do the things I do I do it because of
[50:46] the love of God in my heart cuz he saved
[50:48] me
[50:49] amen he gave me his own life right all
[50:53] right now giving me his own life
[50:57] then there if we believe in
[51:00] God you know that's a question back to
[51:03] you cuz you know the question I've been
[51:05] asking you is if you have it and see
[51:08] that means when you when you say if
[51:12] that's a question you know and I'm not
[51:15] questioning whether the Bible's right or
[51:17] not I'm laying it down into you and to
[51:20] me as to question our own selves right
[51:24] you know right the Bible says exact
[51:26] yourself to see whether you're in the
[51:28] faith or not well check it out you see
[51:32] what those in the Bible the way they
[51:34] live and then that's the way we ought to
[51:36] live you know right would you see Jesus
[51:40] out here doing what people claim in the
[51:41] religious world that they're Christians
[51:43] but yet you know going to all kind of
[51:46] things and events and situations and
[51:48] doing things wrong would would Jesus do
[51:52] that right no no no he wouldn't do that
[51:56] so then we must get down to the basis of
[51:58] finding out that we have to receive
[52:02] eternal life to have it right we say
[52:06] will we come to the world with eternal
[52:08] life where was
[52:11] it was it in your body was it in your
[52:14] spirit was it in your soul where was it
[52:18] at now that's what we want to get on
[52:22] because Eternal as I've been trying to
[52:24] express to you Eternal is a word it
[52:29] comes from the word Zoe which means
[52:31] God's own life right now you've got all
[52:34] kind of eons and aons and things like
[52:36] that that look real real close to
[52:39] Eternal but just remember my definition
[52:43] of Eternity or
[52:46] Eternal eternity is eternal means it
[52:50] goes just as far that
[52:52] away and can never end if it ever ends
[52:56] it's not Eternal true but it also
[53:00] means did it
[53:03] come from just that much backward
[53:07] somewhere well then it didn't ever begin
[53:10] God didn't
[53:13] begin he had no beginning and no
[53:16] ending see in doing that then if we
[53:19] receive his
[53:21] life all right if his life will come
[53:25] into us by the new
[53:27] birth then that life that we have has no
[53:32] beginning and no ending right right amen
[53:34] it's eternal life amen that's right see
[53:38] and see this is to Know Thee the
[53:39] scripture says eternal life see all
[53:44] right then if if we have eternal life
[53:48] there's no beginning
[53:51] right now there was a time you and I had
[53:54] a beginning right right the father you
[53:56] can go back in to to doing is the
[53:59] thinking of God in his mind right all
[54:03] right but just remember when you go back
[54:06] to what you're thinking in God's mind
[54:08] you've went out of existence of this
[54:10] life right right so you're not dealing
[54:14] with us as human beings right in
[54:17] relationship to that right see now so
[54:22] then if we have eternal life
[54:26] there was a day you didn't have it but
[54:29] then a day you received
[54:31] it now it don't matter what you done
[54:34] bill was telling me while ago that he
[54:36] bought him a bigger boat after I was
[54:38] there and he probably got a smaller one
[54:39] now we still want to get down there but
[54:41] I want to ride them ways I want it a
[54:42] little more calmer you know but anyhow
[54:45] you know there was a day he didn't have
[54:47] that boat right right it didn't matter
[54:50] if he made the down payment on
[54:53] it it didn't matter if he was you know
[54:56] said that's my boat but he had to go get
[54:58] the
[55:00] boat and by getting the boat then he had
[55:03] the boat that that you know I solved it
[55:06] well see that's a carnal comparison but
[55:09] it's the same way of talking if eternal
[55:12] life the psalmist David said in two or
[55:15] three ssongs I put them together that we
[55:17] were born in sin shapen in iniquity and
[55:20] a spouse from our mother is wound a
[55:23] liar Paul said we all had our
[55:26] conversation in times past in the lust
[55:29] of the flesh amen well if you put
[55:32] eternal life back there as a person of
[55:37] eternal life then you've got an eternal
[55:40] sinner
[55:41] right amen and see that won't work
[55:44] that's we don't believe in eternal hell
[55:46] right right we believe in Hell burning
[55:49] forever and ever and ever and ever and
[55:51] ever and ever and ever you know I was
[55:53] listening to him today uh on the news
[55:57] and well it was a guy talking and and he
[56:01] said that if you took I forgot what it
[56:03] was it would take you I forgot how many
[56:05] years 250 years if you spend $1,000 a
[56:09] day it would take you I forgot how many
[56:11] hundreds of years to be able to spend a
[56:13] billion dollars you know i' like to try
[56:17] it you know I could probably get ahead
[56:19] of them a little bit but you know how it
[56:21] is that's right but you know the point
[56:24] was in school we were told how big a
[56:26] room it would be to hold1 million $1
[56:30] bills if you stack them up it' take a
[56:32] big room to hold that see well all right
[56:35] now see people are thinking about being
[56:37] Millionaires and they can make it y all
[56:40] right people are making billionaires but
[56:42] look at our national debt
[56:46] right what is it is it 10,000 billion to
[56:49] makes a trilon is that the that the
[56:52] calculations or something like that I
[56:53] mean it's just an unknown number there's
[56:56] no no way to even fathom it but that's
[56:59] how much we owe who do we owe it to
[57:00] ourselves I'll R mine off won't
[57:03] you no problem but see that's not who we
[57:07] owe it to we owe it somewh else but the
[57:10] point I'm getting at
[57:12] is there's a time that you didn't have
[57:15] eternal life I don't care what you think
[57:17] or what you can quote and read and study
[57:19] and do whatever there was a time you
[57:21] didn't have eternal life
[57:24] right right now
[57:27] the main reason I believe
[57:31] that this is this is you may think it's
[57:34] dropping back some but it is but the
[57:36] main reason that I believe that we
[57:39] didn't come here with eternal
[57:41] life is because that we don't believe in
[57:46] an eternal hell you'd have to have God's
[57:48] life to be able to live there that's
[57:50] right so that would put God into hell
[57:52] that would be one thing but we don't
[57:55] believe in Eternal son
[57:56] ship right all right now organized
[57:59] religion teaches father son Holy Ghost
[58:01] Blessed Trinity you know co-equal and
[58:03] coeternal that's the badst phrase of it
[58:06] right now how can a
[58:09] son be as old as a
[58:15] father it can't be right we don't
[58:18] believe in Eternal sunship right cuz a
[58:20] son signifies that someone who had a
[58:23] beginning all right now what are you
[58:30] are you a Son of
[58:32] God come
[58:34] on are you listening right are you a Son
[58:37] of God right you may be careful how you
[58:40] say that right because you're admitting
[58:44] that you had a beginning right if you
[58:47] say you're a
[58:48] son right or daughter now come on make
[58:51] it women or men come
[58:53] on you see then that meant there was a
[58:57] time something
[58:59] began but what we can't comprehend is
[59:02] that they can take the DNA now from a
[59:06] person and run that genealogy way
[59:09] back as a matter of fact if they
[59:11] probably desired to they could run
[59:14] everything back to the flood you know
[59:16] right and then you'd have hamam and
[59:18] japeth and their descendants you know
[59:20] and no and his and Noah didn't have any
[59:22] children on the other side of the flood
[59:24] so everything would be coming from hamam
[59:25] and Jacob right and then if you could go
[59:28] on back you could trace it all the way
[59:29] back to find out of whether it was Adam
[59:32] or the Beast would be your father right
[59:35] because that's the DNA we talk about all
[59:38] the
[59:39] apples that will ever be on an apple
[59:42] tree where were they at right where did
[59:45] they come from they had to be in the
[59:48] seed right that was planted y see all
[59:53] right apple seed you put it in the
[59:55] ground now you can't look at all that
[59:57] and see all them apples right there's no
[1:00:01] way cuz it could be bushels or bushels
[1:00:02] or bushels of apples finally come off
[1:00:05] but their originality was right there in
[1:00:08] that one seed and see that's what people
[1:00:10] can't see about trying to comprehend God
[1:00:14] right you were in your
[1:00:19] father you were in your
[1:00:21] grandfather cuz that's where the DNA can
[1:00:24] prove it you were in your
[1:00:26] great-grandfather great great great
[1:00:27] great just keep going going well on back
[1:00:31] see but yet you wasn't there as a little
[1:00:36] germ you
[1:00:38] know floating
[1:00:40] around you were only there in the
[1:00:44] invisible of of life to where that
[1:00:46] there's no way that science can find the
[1:00:49] gene of life amen you know they can take
[1:00:52] a a blade of Grace and they can examine
[1:00:54] it take a grain of corn they can examine
[1:00:56] it but they can't find the life that's
[1:00:59] right but you can take that grain of
[1:01:01] corn and you can totally grind it
[1:01:04] up you know that's what I was telling
[1:01:06] you the other day about it but you know
[1:01:08] a lot of people overseas will hear this
[1:01:10] they wouldn't understand but you know
[1:01:12] maybe they understand about the chickens
[1:01:13] but see we feed them a lot of grain here
[1:01:16] well you know in that grain you you put
[1:01:18] that chicken litter back on your garden
[1:01:20] you're going to get a lot of weeds that
[1:01:22] you didn't plant or thought you didn't
[1:01:23] plant but they was in that chicken when
[1:01:26] it went in the ground and it'll
[1:01:28] eventually come up why because it's
[1:01:30] totally that is an invisible
[1:01:33] thing right see then if you're going to
[1:01:36] say I was a gene in
[1:01:38] God and now I'm a Son of
[1:01:43] God you better consider what you're
[1:01:49] saying all right cuz if you're a Son of
[1:01:52] God right it means somewhere you had a
[1:01:55] beginning right
[1:01:57] right all right and you got to be made
[1:02:04] Eternal all right right so then the
[1:02:07] point
[1:02:09] is what are we trying to prove by saying
[1:02:12] that we always was
[1:02:14] eternal we're by passing Jesus Christ
[1:02:16] dying on Calvary for us right that's
[1:02:19] right and that's one thing that I'm
[1:02:21] highly against is is preaching like that
[1:02:24] cuz I want the people to see that must
[1:02:26] be born again I went to a church one
[1:02:28] time and preached on justification
[1:02:30] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:32] Ghost and it was it was a brother that
[1:02:34] come to Pentecost That was supposed to
[1:02:37] you know believe all that and he got
[1:02:39] highly upset at me because he said I
[1:02:41] preached wrong I said what he said you
[1:02:44] got my people seeking God I said well
[1:02:48] Hallelujah I'm sorry that I preached
[1:02:50] something that you didn't agree with
[1:02:53] right all right but I said I will not
[1:02:56] apologize for what I said and if they're
[1:02:59] seeking God that's exactly what I wanted
[1:03:01] them to do I'd like for you to do it
[1:03:05] words because see we get into the idea
[1:03:08] that we're so great or something you
[1:03:10] know a lot of people thinks God can't do
[1:03:12] without them yeah oh my you ever run
[1:03:14] into people like that they think the
[1:03:16] world can't operate without them oh my
[1:03:18] we used to have there G Motors they
[1:03:20] thought man if they just run that whole
[1:03:21] plant and if they was out well you know
[1:03:24] what a lot of times when those people
[1:03:25] retired they didn't even replace them
[1:03:29] right right when Tom retired it play
[1:03:32] they took three
[1:03:33] people when brother Tom Fus retired it
[1:03:36] took three people to do his job and yet
[1:03:39] he spent 6 hours a day with me talking
[1:03:41] about the work oh my you said well how
[1:03:45] in the world he do it cuz he worked like
[1:03:46] crazy the other two and he knew how to
[1:03:49] get everything done so he go get it all
[1:03:50] done and they would all tickle it took
[1:03:52] three people to replace them but had a
[1:03:54] lot of people when they retired they
[1:03:56] didn't even replace them I didn't go
[1:03:57] back to find out whether it did to me or
[1:03:59] not I wasn't concerned about it I just
[1:04:01] wanted my retirement and you know but
[1:04:04] now
[1:04:07] listen then if we think about
[1:04:10] it as trying to deal with it as Eternal
[1:04:16] sunship what have we
[1:04:20] done there's no such thing as Eternal
[1:04:22] sunship right
[1:04:26] that's the organizational theories I
[1:04:28] said the Baptist said you
[1:04:30] know God the Father God the son God the
[1:04:33] Holy Ghost co-equal co-eternal
[1:04:36] In other words all three of them is
[1:04:39] eternal but then they'll turn around and
[1:04:41] tell you you can't explain that you
[1:04:45] can't and I agreed with him because you
[1:04:48] know I couldn't understand it
[1:04:51] then but now I understand a little
[1:04:53] better about it right how can you have
[1:04:56] an eternal
[1:04:58] son right now you can have a son of
[1:05:01] God that's right that has eternal life
[1:05:05] right and if you receive eternal life
[1:05:09] then that life you receive always was
[1:05:12] eternal right all right right now so
[1:05:16] then see it's not Eternal
[1:05:19] sunship right it's Eternal
[1:05:23] godship Jesus wasn't an eternal son of
[1:05:25] God
[1:05:27] right he was God manifested In the Flesh
[1:05:31] in a form called a son right he would
[1:05:35] stand on Earth and say if you seen me
[1:05:37] you've seen the father
[1:05:40] right he didn't have no problem saying
[1:05:42] that
[1:05:43] amen we're not West but we believe in
[1:05:46] one true and living God right that's
[1:05:48] right see he had to come that way to be
[1:05:50] able to display and die for you and I
[1:05:53] right Amen to wor it we could receive
[1:05:56] eternal life amen he had to give his
[1:06:00] life to release it right it was bottled
[1:06:02] up in him see am see because the Holy
[1:06:05] Ghost has not been given because Jesus
[1:06:06] has not been glorified the scripture
[1:06:09] says see then we need to get down to
[1:06:11] think about
[1:06:13] it are we Eternal Sons how can we
[1:06:18] be now if he wasn't an eternal
[1:06:24] son we can't be an eternal
[1:06:27] son so when we receive eternal
[1:06:32] life that had no
[1:06:34] beginning and had no ending right no
[1:06:38] time it ever started right you remember
[1:06:41] that in in Hebrews about melic no
[1:06:44] beginning of days about melic there in
[1:06:47] about uh Hebrews
[1:06:49] 7 said he had no beginning of days no
[1:06:52] ending of
[1:06:53] life no descent
[1:06:56] so it was almighty
[1:06:58] God see Jesus then had to be almighty
[1:07:02] God or you would be making him an
[1:07:04] eternal
[1:07:08] son and see in in no way do I believe
[1:07:12] that but I believe he stepped over in a
[1:07:14] form to come down to reveal himself and
[1:07:17] could be called a
[1:07:20] son the Bible said in him right right
[1:07:23] dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:07:26] right all right Father Son and Holy
[1:07:28] Ghost grow in that body right amen and
[1:07:32] see in doing that then he was not an
[1:07:34] eternal
[1:07:38] son he had eternal life right so then he
[1:07:42] was God's own life dwelling in flesh
[1:07:44] Emmanuel as we read it God With Us
[1:07:49] right now when we receive that same
[1:07:52] eternal life
[1:07:56] do you think that makes you a
[1:07:59] son come
[1:08:01] on or does it make you God in human
[1:08:04] flesh come
[1:08:06] on that's what Paul on Mars Hills was
[1:08:08] talking to him about
[1:08:11] right he said to the unknown God y right
[1:08:14] the ones you wrote up you know there a
[1:08:16] sign there just in case they goofed up
[1:08:18] and didn't get all of them they left a
[1:08:19] little sign said to the unknown God he
[1:08:21] said that's one I'd like to talk to you
[1:08:22] about that's right he said even your
[1:08:24] poets has a
[1:08:26] agreed that we are God's Offspring
[1:08:30] right now that's why those
[1:08:33] Pharisees was upset with
[1:08:36] Jesus
[1:08:38] right they were upset with Jesus as he
[1:08:40] would call himself a son even though it
[1:08:43] would be son of
[1:08:47] man they didn't like
[1:08:49] that because they
[1:08:52] believed that they were The Offspring of
[1:08:54] God
[1:08:56] right but there was no way it could be
[1:08:58] made manifest back there until Jesus
[1:09:01] Christ come and died that's right see he
[1:09:03] had to release the life you understand
[1:09:05] amen and you say well I always was
[1:09:07] eternal yeah I was in him on that's
[1:09:11] right yeah if I have eternal life
[1:09:13] tonight right if you have eternal life
[1:09:18] the eternal life you have is got to be
[1:09:19] the life of God right amen right and
[1:09:23] that way you got no beginning or no
[1:09:24] ending right amen well brother Dale
[1:09:28] that's just a little too much to try to
[1:09:30] say that we're god well well tell me
[1:09:34] why Jesus told him
[1:09:37] said your Gods to whom the word come to
[1:09:40] that's
[1:09:42] right he was R for I know the prophets
[1:09:45] and things yes but still see we are his
[1:09:49] offspring
[1:09:51] amen but we must be born again amen amen
[1:09:55] we must receive eternal life if not what
[1:09:58] did Jesus die for I keep repeating
[1:10:00] that why didn't he go to Nicodemus and
[1:10:03] say Nicodemus followed the rule book
[1:10:05] Nicodemus would have looked at him and
[1:10:07] said hey Glory I've had it all the time
[1:10:09] but I've always followed the rule book
[1:10:11] right if you can show me I'm wrong
[1:10:13] anywhere let them kill me and they
[1:10:17] wouldn't but you see we want to take a
[1:10:21] quote and isolate that
[1:10:24] quote h
[1:10:26] and make a point out of it or
[1:10:28] scripture and make a point out of it
[1:10:32] instead of accepting the way God sent
[1:10:37] it you know that that message of
[1:10:39] redemption was so important he couldn't
[1:10:41] trust it with a prophet right
[1:10:44] right he
[1:10:46] didn't right he came himself
[1:10:50] right he didn't trust the message of
[1:10:52] redemption since together with anybody
[1:10:54] else he came himself right he come down
[1:10:58] to live with us amen you say you mean
[1:11:00] you believe that was God now the flesh
[1:11:02] no the flesh was a human body that's
[1:11:05] right brought into existence for God to
[1:11:07] live in but you better remember it was
[1:11:08] the body of God it comes in the blood of
[1:11:10] God come on it was created it never had
[1:11:13] no birth from a woman and a man come on
[1:11:16] right all the rest of us come from woman
[1:11:18] and man but he didn't he come by
[1:11:21] creation God created the egg and the
[1:11:23] germ or sperm or whatever to call it
[1:11:25] placed it in the wound of Mary let her
[1:11:27] carry it amen right but the Catholics
[1:11:30] and actually your Protestants believe
[1:11:32] that Mary gave the egg and God
[1:11:34] fertilized it well that make the body
[1:11:36] sinful that's right that's right and
[1:11:38] that won't work
[1:11:41] right you see what I'm talking about are
[1:11:43] we Sons and Daughters of
[1:11:48] God the new birth gives you the same
[1:11:51] life that God had
[1:11:53] amen or else we don't have the new
[1:11:57] right you see why everybody's wondered
[1:12:00] always has wondered what must we do to
[1:12:03] be saved you know what can I do what can
[1:12:05] can is there something I can do or or or
[1:12:08] any way you
[1:12:09] know right you see if you told
[1:12:13] everybody see that's what Catholicism
[1:12:16] does and I'm not that's their business
[1:12:17] I'm preaching here ain't nothing out
[1:12:19] there that's their business but what
[1:12:21] does Catholicism say give you money to
[1:12:24] the church you're automatically going
[1:12:25] into heaven oh my now you tell me they
[1:12:27] don't say that I'll tell you you you've
[1:12:29] got a messed up conception
[1:12:33] somewhere but what about the the
[1:12:38] denominations yep right well that
[1:12:41] brother's going to heaven cuz he paved
[1:12:42] the parking
[1:12:44] lot well oh my if he paved a little in
[1:12:48] glory he might have been better off cuz
[1:12:49] it's paid with gold but he didn't pave
[1:12:52] it
[1:12:55] but you see we try to make it on
[1:12:57] something that we can do
[1:13:00] right that's right is there anything
[1:13:03] that we can do to be
[1:13:05] saved does it mean I could stand on my
[1:13:08] head for you know for a week no would
[1:13:11] that do it you know could I do as
[1:13:14] Catholicism and crawl like Martin Luther
[1:13:16] crawl down on GL and pierced all over
[1:13:19] and nails and stuff like that and do
[1:13:21] penants would that save
[1:13:23] me right that's why he preached the
[1:13:26] message he saw that was wrong amen
[1:13:28] that's right his sincerity was great but
[1:13:31] he saw that that never brought salvation
[1:13:33] because it never brought him a clear
[1:13:36] conscience
[1:13:40] right but Salvation deals with the
[1:13:42] inward part of you working back
[1:13:47] outwardly then I Believe by receiving
[1:13:49] eternal
[1:13:51] life I can be called a Son of God in the
[1:13:54] natural you know
[1:13:56] people but really inside of me God is
[1:13:59] living right amen cuz I don't believe
[1:14:02] there a whole bunch of
[1:14:05] gods that's where we cannot comprehend
[1:14:07] it cuz like like I told you there's 7
[1:14:09] billion people in the world today every
[1:14:12] person in the world could accept Jesus
[1:14:13] Christ and he would give him eternal
[1:14:15] life you know that wouldn't do away with
[1:14:16] any of his
[1:14:17] life no you have enough for Mars and
[1:14:20] Venus and any other planet you think
[1:14:22] there somebody out there you know
[1:14:26] I've always said if you think there's
[1:14:27] somebody out there they need
[1:14:29] salvation right right I mean if there
[1:14:32] somebody out there whether he look like
[1:14:34] a monkey or whatever he looks like he
[1:14:36] needed to be born
[1:14:38] again because that's what we all want to
[1:14:42] do but you
[1:14:44] see we must
[1:14:46] have the new birth to have eternal
[1:14:50] life now what is the new birth
[1:14:55] the prophet of God on Christ The Mystery
[1:14:56] of God revealed he said what is the new
[1:14:58] world you see that he said it's Christ
[1:15:00] revealed to you personally right
[1:15:04] right my children didn't get eternal
[1:15:06] life because of
[1:15:08] me I don't believe in that my wife
[1:15:11] doesn't get eternal life because of me
[1:15:13] my grandkids my great grandchild they
[1:15:15] don't get eternal life because of
[1:15:18] me they get it because of their own
[1:15:20] experience with God right all right and
[1:15:24] when they re seeed that eternal life
[1:15:26] then that eternal life had no beginning
[1:15:28] right so right there the very second of
[1:15:31] what you want to call
[1:15:33] it when that Holy Ghost fell on the day
[1:15:36] of
[1:15:37] Pentecost they went up there as Sinners
[1:15:40] scared to death that's right they were
[1:15:42] in the upper room pulled apart and
[1:15:45] hiding but when the Holy Ghost
[1:15:51] came they went out hunting the people to
[1:15:53] talk to him
[1:15:56] and there everyone gave their life
[1:15:58] except John who went to patmas the only
[1:16:01] one that died of a natural
[1:16:04] death all the rest of them died Peter
[1:16:06] said don't hang me like that put me
[1:16:09] upside down on the
[1:16:11] cross I ain't worthy to be hung with my
[1:16:14] master that's right you mean people that
[1:16:16] would give their lives that's what it's
[1:16:18] told there in the fox's book of Martyrs
[1:16:20] you know of down through the Dark Ages
[1:16:21] when they were killing the Christians
[1:16:23] that actually the guards a lot of times
[1:16:25] would just throw down their weapons and
[1:16:27] just walk right into the lon's Dead with
[1:16:29] those Christians because they' seen a
[1:16:32] life that they
[1:16:34] wanted right and they would just give
[1:16:37] their
[1:16:38] life the eternal life is a gift
[1:16:43] right it's given unto you because of not
[1:16:47] how good we are it's given because of
[1:16:49] what we can believe
[1:16:51] right does the Bible say believe on the
[1:16:53] Lord Jesus Christ and thou shall be safe
[1:16:56] wouldn't know what Peter and Paul and
[1:16:58] them told the Jailer he said even your
[1:17:01] own own household see what he brought
[1:17:03] his household in and let them listen to
[1:17:04] the gospel and they got saved
[1:17:07] too he had a part to do with that we
[1:17:09] have a part to do with our families
[1:17:11] receiving it sure because we try to
[1:17:13] raise them up in the right atmosphere
[1:17:16] right but we can't give them eternal
[1:17:19] life right right
[1:17:21] amen and according to what a lot of
[1:17:23] people call eternal life I actually
[1:17:25] don't want it no oh my I'm serious
[1:17:28] that's right I don't play games I'm
[1:17:30] serious what a lot of people call
[1:17:32] eternal life that ain't done nothing for
[1:17:33] no more than what's done for a lot of
[1:17:34] people I don't want what they got that's
[1:17:38] right and I certainly don't have what I
[1:17:41] need to
[1:17:42] have I'm kind of like the the the lady
[1:17:45] was that said you know I'm not what I
[1:17:46] used to be and I'm not what I ought to
[1:17:48] be but I'm not I'm not what I ought to
[1:17:49] be not what I want to be because I
[1:17:51] certainly ain't what I used to be am I
[1:17:54] have come from somewhere
[1:17:56] am see eternal
[1:17:59] life is a
[1:18:03] gift if mankind wants to be
[1:18:08] saved then it's up to God to provide a
[1:18:11] way to save that person that's right
[1:18:14] would you agree with that amen if
[1:18:16] somebody wants to be saved that's why
[1:18:18] it's offered to
[1:18:21] everybody it was offered to Judas he had
[1:18:25] three and A2 years of Ministry of
[1:18:27] casting out devils and Healing The Sick
[1:18:29] amen that's
[1:18:31] right but yet he turned it down
[1:18:35] right not because he he turned down the
[1:18:37] Lord Jesus Peter was worse than than
[1:18:39] Judas was that's right that's right amen
[1:18:42] Peter denied him in cursed doing it
[1:18:44] that's right we want to throw off on
[1:18:47] Judas a he was just the son of predition
[1:18:50] what made him the son of predition
[1:18:55] sure God's for knowledge knew what he'd
[1:18:57] do he knew exactly what he'd do right
[1:18:59] but you know he put up with it for three
[1:19:00] and A2 years right you know he talked
[1:19:02] with him daily for three and 1/2 years
[1:19:05] you know he tried every day to save the
[1:19:06] man come on
[1:19:10] right you say would God do that well he
[1:19:13] did that's
[1:19:17] right but you understand what I'm trying
[1:19:19] to get
[1:19:21] to if eternal life has no beginning
[1:19:25] right then it goes just as far that way
[1:19:28] you know pointing to the people on the
[1:19:31] internet is not seeing it just pointing
[1:19:32] just as far back that way as it is
[1:19:35] pointing over that
[1:19:37] way and I don't believe that it will
[1:19:39] ever run out to where God will not be
[1:19:41] revealing himself to you and I right how
[1:19:44] can you exhaust an eternal God come on
[1:19:48] an eternal word we're just getting a a
[1:19:52] part to be able to understand right
[1:19:56] amen this is just the trials and the
[1:19:58] test to get us to a place to be able to
[1:20:00] comprehend God
[1:20:02] right when we get over there down to the
[1:20:05] endless ages it just be him revealing
[1:20:07] himself right well then as far as you
[1:20:11] just go back that way and you can't go
[1:20:12] back you can't stop nowhere
[1:20:16] right if you stop you say oh it's just a
[1:20:19] circle well now see you just caught
[1:20:23] yourself you say it's just a
[1:20:26] circle right now the com the the the
[1:20:29] statement the prophet made about being a
[1:20:31] circle means it had no beginning and no
[1:20:34] end but if you say it's just a circle
[1:20:37] then you're saying there's somewhere
[1:20:38] that it
[1:20:44] begin he said no no no no well come on
[1:20:47] explain it to
[1:20:49] me if a circle will start here and go
[1:20:52] all the way around and come back to
[1:20:53] there it started somewhere right y right
[1:21:00] that's just a natural way of expressing
[1:21:03] eternal
[1:21:04] life as I told you even the universe is
[1:21:08] moving they've known that science has
[1:21:10] known that for for probably close to 100
[1:21:12] years now that the whole universe is
[1:21:15] just
[1:21:16] moving it's not standing
[1:21:18] still because once it's slung off back
[1:21:21] there yeah it just never stops it just
[1:21:24] keeps on
[1:21:25] going and then we go flying out through
[1:21:28] space so many million light years out
[1:21:30] through space and we find planets out
[1:21:32] through there that are bigger than where
[1:21:33] we
[1:21:37] are ghost to sh there's a
[1:21:39] God Amen eternal life had no beginning
[1:21:44] has no ending to it so if you have
[1:21:46] eternal
[1:21:48] life that's the
[1:21:50] question that eternal life you have
[1:21:52] always was eternal right
[1:21:57] but there was a day you didn't have it
[1:21:59] as a possession
[1:22:02] right cuz we ought to have enough sense
[1:22:05] in our brain let alone the Revelation
[1:22:07] come on Amen I mean my Lord folks right
[1:22:11] you mean to tell me you think you always
[1:22:13] was eternal and then you live like the
[1:22:15] devil now get off of it that's right I
[1:22:18] can stand up here and say a lot of
[1:22:19] things about those things to you because
[1:22:21] I didn't go out and do what most of you
[1:22:23] done
[1:22:26] that don't make me no different that
[1:22:27] didn't save me no quicker it made me
[1:22:30] harder to be saved because see the
[1:22:32] reason it made me harder to be saved you
[1:22:34] people would tell me that you quit this
[1:22:35] and you quit that it proves you saved I
[1:22:37] said I never did do it to start with
[1:22:41] right I'm not a goody two shoes no but I
[1:22:44] can sure tell you that I didn't do what
[1:22:45] a lot of people's
[1:22:48] done but it took more grace for
[1:22:51] me that's right than it did for anybody
[1:22:55] Paul said I'm the chiefest of
[1:22:58] Sinners
[1:23:00] why because I had to get over the church
[1:23:05] and myself to be able to be saved right
[1:23:07] that's why it took me two years after
[1:23:09] coming into the message before I
[1:23:10] received eternal
[1:23:13] life where everybody else says that they
[1:23:15] come into the message prove that had
[1:23:17] eternal life I never said that I I
[1:23:20] sought God until I was
[1:23:23] satisfied with in my experience that I'd
[1:23:26] received
[1:23:28] some don't never stop searching for God
[1:23:31] I have never
[1:23:34] stopped I pray every day
[1:23:37] Lord Reveal Your word to
[1:23:40] me reveal yourself unto me
[1:23:43] Lord show me what I
[1:23:46] need I know how dirty I Am Lord you
[1:23:49] don't have to tell me
[1:23:51] that that's what everybody thinks about
[1:23:53] preaching is that think you supposed to
[1:23:54] tell everybody how dirty they are how
[1:23:57] you
[1:23:58] know you mean I've got to tell you how
[1:24:01] how dirty you are
[1:24:02] yeah I don't mean natural
[1:24:06] now but I've got to tell you what's in
[1:24:09] your life and then you get saved no you
[1:24:11] won't that's
[1:24:13] right never worked yet right brother
[1:24:17] brandham could stand there under that
[1:24:18] discernment and call out those people's
[1:24:20] lives and tell them what was going on
[1:24:22] and you know what he finally done he
[1:24:24] finally qu doing it right you know what
[1:24:26] he said he said CA it caused divorces y
[1:24:30] it caused murders now you go read and
[1:24:32] see if you didn't say it amen now at
[1:24:35] times he still called out things but not
[1:24:37] like he did in his early ministry right
[1:24:40] cuz see in his early Ministry like Jack
[1:24:42] Cole brother Tatum was talking about
[1:24:43] when Jack Cole looked down there and
[1:24:44] told that fell said you're running
[1:24:46] around that woman right over there boy
[1:24:48] there's a big old prayer line coming
[1:24:49] down to him to be prayed for they looked
[1:24:51] in a minute and they wouldn't harly
[1:24:52] nobody in the prayer line
[1:24:55] right why they didn't want him calling
[1:24:58] out what they've been doing
[1:25:00] right they so they didn't want to be
[1:25:03] saved right right right you know that
[1:25:07] most people don't want to be saved yeah
[1:25:10] they want a happy Hunting Ground
[1:25:13] amen they want some place to go to but
[1:25:17] they can be good and make it on their
[1:25:20] goodness but we can't make it on that
[1:25:23] you got to be born born
[1:25:25] again but the very Split Second that
[1:25:28] you're born again that eternal life that
[1:25:30] you have always was eternal right amen
[1:25:34] we get back to it Sunday going through
[1:25:35] the quotes of where the Prophet would
[1:25:36] say if you have eternal
[1:25:42] life you always was eternal
[1:25:46] right what's he
[1:25:48] saying if you had
[1:25:51] it you always put the question to us if
[1:25:55] we have eternal life
[1:25:57] right you know why because eternal life
[1:26:00] we receive always was eternal right
[1:26:03] amen it had no beginning had no
[1:26:07] ending it always was
[1:26:10] eternal but I hope you call what I said
[1:26:12] there while AG go there because we don't
[1:26:14] believe in Eternal sunship and Jesus
[1:26:16] wasn't an eternal Son of
[1:26:21] God but inside of that man that we call
[1:26:25] Jesus dwelt almighty
[1:26:28] God Body Spirit and soul of almighty God
[1:26:31] dwelt upon Earth among mankind right
[1:26:35] right y that's why he could say unless
[1:26:38] you believe that I am he said you will
[1:26:40] die in your sins that's right he said I
[1:26:44] and my father are
[1:26:47] one oh well that's like one you know
[1:26:50] that's like that's my son Wade there he
[1:26:53] he he he he doesn't resemble me he
[1:26:55] resemble his dad his my dad-in-law the
[1:26:58] cash side but you know we'd say oh he
[1:27:00] just looks exactly like his daddy and
[1:27:02] everything but that's not the kind it is
[1:27:04] with
[1:27:06] God you remember how the prophet
[1:27:08] explained it when that lady said oh
[1:27:09] brother brandom said when I see you said
[1:27:12] you know I see your wife he said there's
[1:27:13] something wrong with you said you can't
[1:27:15] see it that way right he said you see me
[1:27:18] said yes the word my wife well you
[1:27:20] know right he trapped her yep and I hope
[1:27:24] it traps you thinking about eternal life
[1:27:26] making you an eternal
[1:27:29] son cuz it made you an eternal son
[1:27:32] you've messed up the entire Bible that's
[1:27:34] right but if it made you God
[1:27:39] manifested in another form called the
[1:27:41] bride of
[1:27:42] Christ
[1:27:44] right see that's what eternal life
[1:27:47] is eternal life is God living in
[1:27:52] you amen
[1:27:55] now if man had thought of that all the
[1:27:56] way down to there he wouldn't have got
[1:27:57] off in organized
[1:28:01] religions he wouldn't have got off in
[1:28:03] those
[1:28:07] things if you just read the
[1:28:10] Bible read it for yourself go to Matthew
[1:28:13] Mark Luke and John when the Lord Jesus
[1:28:16] was here and look at all of the times he
[1:28:18] referred to himself as being
[1:28:21] God now watch what they said
[1:28:27] they said you make yourself equal with
[1:28:31] God
[1:28:33] right he wasn't equal with God he was
[1:28:35] God Nei that he's biggest deceiver it's
[1:28:38] ever been if it is we're in bad shape
[1:28:39] that's
[1:28:42] right but he brought forth eternal life
[1:28:49] right and if it's like most people
[1:28:51] thinks about eternal life as being a
[1:28:53] thought so you're an
[1:28:55] idea then why did Jesus have to die why
[1:28:58] didn't he just step right back into
[1:28:59] eternity right off the
[1:29:02] Earth he could have done that anytime he
[1:29:04] wanted to you
[1:29:05] know he said I get 12 Legions of angels
[1:29:08] come and get me off his
[1:29:10] cross well my Lord wormwood destroyed
[1:29:13] the world with water 12
[1:29:16] Legions what is that 144,000 because the
[1:29:19] legions about a th000 of course there
[1:29:21] more than other calculations but what
[1:29:24] did he
[1:29:25] need if he gave his if he' come off that
[1:29:28] cross we wouldn't have eternal life
[1:29:30] that's right
[1:29:35] amen well the way people think about it
[1:29:37] is just a
[1:29:40] thought then they'll say well well I
[1:29:42] know what the prophet said that we come
[1:29:45] with this eternal Gene in us we keep
[1:29:49] searching we'll get to it Sunday keep
[1:29:51] searching until you find out what he
[1:29:53] said where that seed was put in you
[1:29:58] at I was born into the world eternal
[1:30:01] life now show me the
[1:30:02] quote show me the
[1:30:07] scripture he said the seed was put in
[1:30:09] you before the foundation of the
[1:30:14] world now that be back before any
[1:30:17] existence of life right
[1:30:21] right when your name was written in the
[1:30:23] L Book of
[1:30:25] Life what when the lamb was
[1:30:28] slain Revelation 138 right before the
[1:30:32] foundation of the world then your name
[1:30:33] was right there with
[1:30:35] him and he come to redeem all of those
[1:30:39] names right what is eternal
[1:30:45] life well it's just a thought no no it's
[1:30:48] not just a
[1:30:52] thought but is it one of them believes
[1:30:54] that the devil is the good one Church
[1:30:56] believes the devil is the bad part of
[1:30:58] your minds and God is the good part of
[1:31:00] your minds well you know I I kind of
[1:31:04] like for my mind to get better sometimes
[1:31:06] with you you know but think about
[1:31:11] it what is eternal
[1:31:15] life then you can see that if you
[1:31:18] received it right
[1:31:21] now now listen
[1:31:25] there will be a group of people at the
[1:31:26] white Throne
[1:31:28] judgment that are what we call foolish
[1:31:30] virgin that's Matthew 25 she got five
[1:31:33] wise and five
[1:31:34] foolish there'll be a people at the
[1:31:36] white Throne judgment to receive eternal
[1:31:38] life
[1:31:41] right you know what they go to the white
[1:31:44] Throne judgment without it right right
[1:31:47] that true right and then they receive it
[1:31:51] well you know what the eternal life they
[1:31:54] receive will not make them as the bride
[1:31:57] of Christ
[1:31:58] no but it'll make them Eternal
[1:32:02] right why because there's no way to have
[1:32:04] eternal life with having any beginning
[1:32:06] or ending to
[1:32:11] it it can't be it always was
[1:32:16] eternal so if he ever gives it to anyone
[1:32:21] anywhere that eternal life he gives that
[1:32:23] person
[1:32:25] at that second he gives it to
[1:32:28] them then they can say always was
[1:32:33] eternal when we know they went through
[1:32:35] the world and died gave their life and
[1:32:38] got to come up at the white Throne
[1:32:39] judgment to be judged that's right
[1:32:42] that's where I'm so glad we don't have
[1:32:43] to go there cuz see we receive eternal
[1:32:46] life here right if we receive eternal
[1:32:49] life here how can we go to the white thr
[1:32:51] judgment what is there to be judged by
[1:32:54] right well the things that I've done now
[1:32:57] that's the deed done in the body yeah
[1:32:58] there will be one like that but not for
[1:33:00] a decision of eternal life
[1:33:03] right that was what I never could
[1:33:05] understand the Baptist we talking about
[1:33:06] it they say I think I'm saved I hope I'm
[1:33:09] saved I believe I'm saved yeah you know
[1:33:11] if I died right now I believe I'm
[1:33:15] saved you know they never had a
[1:33:20] commitment to the basis of saying you
[1:33:25] know my soul is
[1:33:30] eternal one of these days up in heaven
[1:33:33] that's what it
[1:33:34] said we're going to know we've got
[1:33:36] eternal life see that may have been what
[1:33:39] your mother believed right that may have
[1:33:41] been what your daddy taught you or some
[1:33:43] preacher taught you right
[1:33:47] amen but I thought we're supposed to
[1:33:49] receive eternal life here
[1:33:52] right and then way we don't have to go
[1:33:54] to the white Throne judgment
[1:33:57] right do the prophet express it you mean
[1:33:59] you marry your wife you know you take
[1:34:01] your wife and then you put her to a
[1:34:03] trial to see where she's going to stand
[1:34:05] up or
[1:34:06] not no you don't love her if you do that
[1:34:10] if you love her you'll put up with her
[1:34:11] faults and
[1:34:13] failures right same thing for the woman
[1:34:15] to the man and the man to the woman
[1:34:18] you but what is eternal life there's
[1:34:22] only one form of eternal life and that's
[1:34:24] God's own life amen that's why he wasn't
[1:34:27] an eternal
[1:34:29] son he was God made manifest in the
[1:34:32] flesh called a
[1:34:34] son cuz that was a dispensation or a
[1:34:37] time that he was to dwell here and talk
[1:34:40] on those things and that body was not
[1:34:43] Eternal when he was walking on this
[1:34:45] Earth that human flesh out here but in
[1:34:48] the resurrection and
[1:34:50] Ascension and then coming back he could
[1:34:52] just walk right through the wall
[1:34:57] you've been down to Passion Play and you
[1:34:59] look at them they've done a real good
[1:35:01] job they kind of had the rocks and had
[1:35:03] it made to where that they would just
[1:35:04] move over like this you know and I
[1:35:06] thought it was a good idea cuz it did
[1:35:07] put the point but it moves like that he
[1:35:09] just steps
[1:35:10] out but that wasn't
[1:35:13] it that wasn't what he's talking about
[1:35:16] he appeared among them
[1:35:19] right but then he told him he said you
[1:35:22] go up to Pentecost lost and you wait
[1:35:26] that's right that's it they never had
[1:35:28] eternal life even because I brought out
[1:35:29] their Sunday that he opened the
[1:35:31] scripture said he opened their
[1:35:32] understanding of the scriptures about
[1:35:34] him but that never gave them eternal
[1:35:37] life they had to go to
[1:35:40] Pentecost you and I have got to have a
[1:35:42] Pentecost in our Liv amen right we've
[1:35:44] got to have the new birth right and
[1:35:47] that's a birth of the word the proph
[1:35:50] amen take on these
[1:35:52] things what do you think
[1:35:54] about eternal
[1:36:01] sunship I don't believe
[1:36:04] it because the word would be totally off
[1:36:07] you know Eternal sunship that wouldn't
[1:36:10] work now an eternal God manifested in
[1:36:14] the
[1:36:15] flesh is a different
[1:36:20] thing because that's eternal life right
[1:36:23] come on
[1:36:24] brother think on these
[1:36:27] things what is eternal life that you may
[1:36:31] know him the scripture say
[1:36:34] Amen that you may know him
[1:36:39] Hallelujah that's why the prophet said
[1:36:41] we don't have too many new births
[1:36:43] genuine new
[1:36:45] births he said because the people don't
[1:36:47] plant the word
[1:36:50] correctly how can you give a new birth
[1:36:54] about the word excuse me being
[1:36:59] planted take on these things let's Stand
