========================================

amen God bless you Saints excited to be in the house of the Lord this morning just pull up this little first slide I was just thinking about um Hebrews 13:17 and 18 that we were been reading and uh I'm just wait just a second no all right let's go ahead and pray Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word this morning Lord and as we study these things out out and look into the all the promises that are laid here Lord from from 2,000 years ago Lord Jesus that were written in your word Lord we ask Lord just open it up to us Lord Quicken your word to us Lord and make it real and guide us through your scriptures today I pray God that you'll just be with brother Wade studying and prepareing Lord and open our hearts to today to receive what you have in store for us we pray in your name amen so I I this morning I was you know sometimes when you're when you're studying things out um you you get a little something like 5 minutes before you walk out the door and I just I just threw this into the quotes real quick um because I was thinking uh you think about this statement that Martin Luther made um when he was standing there before the Roman Catholics and everything uh he he said I I you know struggling and praying all the night before when they were asking him to recant all the things that he wrote and he said my conscience is captive to the word of God and you think about what a statement that is that that and he said you know he followed up and said I can I can do no other here I stand I can do no other and so to think about a man that that got to a place where that your conscience your soul down on the inside that you can't he he's thinking well they're going to take my life they're they're you know they're saying all I got to do is is uh just recant and then I can have my life and uh have uh uh things things will be a lot easier but his conscience was captive to the word of God and he could do no other than what the word of God says now that's kind of what we're we're studying on is in Hebrews 13:8 where where Paul's saying pray that we have a good conscience and Hebrews 13:17 says just to set in context I always think it's helpful to read things in context and uh I I was I was meditating there's a Greek word called exag Jesus which means when you study the Bible that's a big word what it means when you study the Bible you don't inject your own ideas into it was which is called ex a Jesus but ex Jesus is where you look at the context and you try to understand the meaning by what the Bible is really saying not not throw in your own your own ideas and your own what you think it means but to look at the context to help interpret what the Bible is saying so to really understand Hebrews 13818 we we need to look at it in the context of what he's saying here in the other scriptures so he saying obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls says they that must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you and then he says in Hebrews 13:18 pray for us for We Trust we have a good conscience and all things willing to live honestly now when you really start studying out the way that brother brandham explains having a good conscience and how he he navigates through that he's a ministers the struggle with where you get to the end of the line where the minister doesn't have a good conscience he said it's always it it's usually those three things money women and popularity that the end of the road will derail you because you uh you now again think about Martin Luther standing there are how's he going to have a good conscience if he wrote all those things that he truly believes in and then recants well same thing with a minister how you going to have a good conscience if you take money instead of standing for the truth or if you if you preach a little bit different or preacher a little bit weaker because you're going to have you're going to g a bigger following or if you're swayed because a lot of people like you or don't like you and the same thing with with with women is is it's and you you can look in uh uh the denominational world and all all sorts of preachers that have fallen because of women and those things derail so many people because and they and they end the end of the road you can't have a good conscience because they instead of sticking with what the word of God Says with what they really believe they get derailed now you think about what a what a con what your conscience really is and and uh it there something about me I'm it takes me I'm I'm a little bit slow kind of getting I have to meditate on things and finally God will speak and just and so that's what I I I try to do when I'm studying on things is try to find the thing that will really kind of get the point across of what the conscience is sometimes it takes me a long time I know some people say they I they can just study for an hour before they bring a message or whatever but sometimes it takes a while but I believe that really the the Clincher of the what your conscience is is is like a red light light a red light green light now now this is how people are when they you know driving a lot of times they'll be at the at the intersection you'll be behind somebody and the and the red light or the red light will be on and somebody behind them especially like if you're in New York City or somewhere they'll they'll get frustrated and start honking why don't you go but the red light says stop you can't go now that God has given us a red light in our heart to tell us when we can go and when we can stop and and when we ignore that red light that's when you start having a problem now so down in your he's giving you that that conscience and if you start ignoring it it'll start it's like your red light it start sinking sinking sinking until it Sears and it just it just doesn't have an effect anymore until brother Rand would say there it's your deathbed if you ignored it and it's just gone it's receded receded receded then all of a sudden it'll come back up again and you realize uh I'm lost and there's your conscience exposing the real the real you because that thing that you've been suppressing all that time now it's come up there at the end so God gives you he gives you a a h a signal to tell you whether you can go or whether you can stop and it's your conscience that if we listen to it it'll it'll guide us all through our life now and of course you think you know we you you you come to the red light you come to the intersection and it might look like you know people walking across the road uh you say well the road's clear there's nothing in there's no I'm going just pull out uh that's how um Esther got in a wreck a while back because somebody somebody ran a red light uh but what years this was years ago it wasn't recent but um you know but the red light is given there for a reason to stop us and keep us to keep us from from harming ourselves now so brother Brown would say and what think you of Christ he said I used to think when I was a little boy and how the first little story and the little girl either that ever told your mother there's a conscience there said don't do this little boy that's wrong don't do that now now I think he's talking about even before you're born again you you know you're just a little kid don't do that that's wrong don't do that you you remember when you smoke that little corn silk cigarette out behind the old fireplace and eat some coffee to keep mother from smelling it on your breath have you been smoking no mama and the conscience begin to say don't do this that's wrong now what what is that that's the red light the red light saying you're not supposed to be doing that and he said see and this this the same quote just continued on she said see then you waade over that and next thing you know you pass by the church you hear the hymns you hear the preaching every red light God flashes before you and you just break the barriers down and go right on don't pay any attention to conscience or nothing else then did God send a person to hell no you sent yourself now now think about what a profound statement that is that he's given something into every the heart of every person like you know you you know you need something you know there's something wrong you know all these kind of things and and and if you step over that if you ignore the red light then that's how you go to hell cuz you ignore the red light you sent yourself that's right you went on your own accord God throws every red light in front of you he could and you just kept moving right on head long you determined to do it and this is same quote continued on he said now there's a red light hanging down here in the city if you run through that red light the city is not responsible for you you did it on your own will that's right so then God has done everything that he can to keep people and to bring them to him and love him and love them so he's give you he give something and every every little child that little signal but then when you get get the Holy Ghost see how it magnify boom now you got the teacher in you to begin teaching you the word now you got God in inside of you but you can still ignore it or listen to it you still it's still that that battle am I going to listen to it or not now now see that's where he's saying that ministers get derailed because instead of instead of staying with the word they'll start going after money women popularity all those thing and that's the same thing with all of us are we going to listen to that conscience or not now now see why are we talking about these things ex of Jesus because we're following Paul through the scripture and Paul is the one that said I want to have a good conscience pray for us that we have a good conscience and Paul is the one that said I want to live honestly now uh well let's just keep going he says so what is the Consciousness he said then the Soul I just laid out these different quotes that I just found throughout the the message and just kind of compile them all here so we can read them briefly and concisely and nicely and neatly he said then the Soul the conscience that once condemn you isn't there anymore and you've gone altogether intellectual so he's defining what that conscience is where it is it's down in your it's the thing that drives you down in the in the the inside of the inside the soul that inside conscience in another quote he said they told her she was wrong that may be telling you same thing tonight she had went to her intellectual parts and believing with her mind that had grieved away that Holy Spirit it didn't speak no more and he's telling a story about the young lady that that I just kept going going and uh until she said things that she shouldn't have said about the gospel and just kept going on until it seared her seared her heart seared her conscience and another place he said your soul will come up and recognize that's the truth and you'll be lost your own conscience will haunt you through eternity when you're having a form of godliness and denying God's word now that's the that's the quote where he's saying you can suppress it and keep pushing it down and ignoring the red light and saying well I'm not going to listen to it until finally there at the end it comes up and it's going to haunt you what's going to haunt you your conscience that you knew you knew you should have done different will haunt you through eternity and look what he's saying the church is pure and another quote he said the church is purged by the Holy Spirit their conscience is seared of doubt and unbelief is taken away now that's what the Holy Ghost can do is instead of of searing you away from listening to the truth but it will sear you away from listening to doubt and and it will change the way you think in so you start going in a different direction now look what he says in God's provided way of fellow approach to Fellowship he said your inner conscience speaks louder than your mouth does you see it's your subconscious on the inside what you really think that's what the Holy Spirit catches and reveals when he's there in the discernment line and the oncoming storm he said now I I this this is something to really Ponder on he's there talking to his wife about how they were they were over there in Finland and and he you know he went over there and and over there they had the where the men could go into the bath houses and these sis these women that would would wash the men they'd get naked and they'd wash them and everything and they're sitting there pondering she's his wife is asking brother R's wife is asking him now these people are Christian people that go to church but yet they don't see anything wrong with a man going to this Bath House of in Finland it's their culture and everything of course they make that as an excuse it's their culture and they they don't see anything wrong with that going in the bath house and letting some woman wash you and you're sitting in there naked what what's what's going on here you ever felt like that you look at how other people act and you're like what what's going on that's now that's the the the the question that a lot of Christians have you're sitting there I'm a Christian and they're a Christian why can they do those things and I can why can they get why do other people why does it seem like other people get away with things but I can't in my heart there's something that just keeps me from doing certain things that other people get away with right now you see we don't we don't uh you that's there you can't go labeling somebody and say Well they're not a Christian but they're in that in that in that PRI in that bedroom moment where brother Bram and his wife are talking they're getting real about some things now listen listen listen to their conversation he said they were FS wonderful people but it's a spirit of the nation wherever you go you find the spirit of a nation and you come to America you've really had it then that's the worst of all and my wife said to me see now they're talking about the finlands now they're talking about Americans I I you go to Dollywood they got the American flag flying behind them and they they say that they're real Christians and everything but why can they do things that I can't and my wife said to me why those people go to church and I've often wondered why it didn't condemn their conscience I said my dear wife let me tell you they are Americans she saidwell why aren't we I said no I said we just live here but we've been born from above the holy spirit of God come upon us now you see now there's the real attitude of the Christian he's not de christianizing nobody he's saying listen in other words where're I'm going on with my Jesus like nobody else is my God I know what God has revealed to me me and I'm going on I've got my own conscience I've got my own guide book in my heart that's guiding me to the truth and I'm going on just the same that's pretty much what he's saying now look you're and so now you got the holy ghost in your life that see that's where you get a bad conscience is if you if you're if you down in your heart the Holy Ghost is telling you not to go to some bath house and let some woman wash you and you do it anyway now you you're doing contrary to your conscience if you know know better than to drink alcohol or do something and you know better and you do it anyway then now now you got a bad conscience cuz there's something that God has given you down in your heart to guide you and keep you from the things that will cause you grief and frustration now that's why uh so what is what is a good conscience now I we've of heard the story of brother Brown talking about how that the little Dove would you do something wrong and it just go to like fly out on the limb or something just kind of that that special anointing that presence that that that kind of confirmation God God's approving my life right now he'll leave you cuz something's grieving him and so your your conscience is your you're a person's overall State we'll say we got moral in there but are are you are you born again or not and it's their sense of living in accordance with God's will cuz now even after you're born again you can still mess up you can still do something you you knew better than that right and you mess up and you kind of go off so that's why in Ephesians 4:29 it says let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth now don't speak evil about somebody don't curse we're not supposed to be cursing and don't don't say anything wrong but that which is good to the use of edifying that they may Minister Grace under the hearers why a grieve not the holy spirit of God because you can grieve the Holy Spirit that's what we're talking about getting a bad conscience in Acts 24:16 I'm just going to run through some scriptures here briefly about having a good conscience here in do I exercise myself Paul said to have always a conscience void of offense toward God and toward men now that's what our goal is right to have a a conscience where we're not where there's nothing between us and God there's nothing between us and my brother or my sister that everything is just working in one Accord and in 1 Timothy 1:5 says now the end of the Commandment the summation of the whole thing is Charity to love out of a pure heart and of a good conscience and of faith unfeigned in 1 Peter 3:16 he said having a good conscience that whereas they speak evil of you as of evildoers they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ now that's a testimony now that it can they can somebody can speak evil of you but still be ashamed because of how good your life is in 1 Timothy 3:9 it says holding the mystery of the faith and a pure conscience and 1 Peter 21:19 says for this is thankworthy if a man for conscience toward God and your grief suffering wrongfully now that's that's certainly a picture of Martin Luther standing there willing to suffer grief willing to endure that night before in agony and prayer and suffering and everything because for his conscience sake because he knew that those things that he had written in those books were true and he wasn't going to stand up there and say well I recant I'm going to go in a different direction but his conscience was held captive to the word of God so we kind of looked at obedience signs of a good conscience say how do you know your your conscience is right if you're doing what the word says if if you if you know that you're supposed to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you can't find any evidence of anybody being baptized in the name of and in in some kind of trinitarian idea and your conscience is H captive of that you'll go through with it and you'll go down into the water and be baptized according to how the Bible says and that's the what what brother rown said your your your your your baptism when you go down it's you're it's an evidence that going down in the water is an Evidence of a good conscience your conscience is correct you're doing it according to what the scripture says and and you do those things when you when you when you look at the scripture and you're looking at what God's word says and you're coming with a repentant heart now that that's what will take away all your guilt and all your shame a good conscience will unburden you from a sense of guilt or shame or wrongdoing and and how do you maintain a good conscience you got to listen to the red light listen to that red light in your heart it's maintained by being responsive to that Holy Ghost down in your heart that discerns right and wrong now brother R would say in Revelation chapter 4 he said some people say it it don't condemn me to wear short hair the women it don't condemn me to wear manicure or makeups or whatever it is it don't condemn me to go to dances it don't condemn me to tell a little white lie it don't condemn me to play bridge in my Bridge party you never have a conversation with that I used to have before Zach and Esther got got filled with the Holy Ghost I have we have conversations like that all the time I don't understand why you got to do such and such and it's like talking to you know if if you don't have the teacher in your heart see see that something changes when you get the New Birth when you get the new birth you're going to have a different conversation because before it's just an argument I don't understand why we got to dress a certain way I don't understand why it's so important you know you you it's like you're battling with something but then when you get the Holy Ghost that's that's what what he's saying there I don't understand why people it's wrong to wear manicure makeups and all this kind of stuff he said no you know why you ain't got nothing to condemn that don't hurt my conscience you got no more conscience than a snake has hips so you just you ain't got no conscience there ain't nothing there to hurt you you're of the world now that goes back to the Finnish and the American Spirit why do people act a different way why why is it it seems like some people can get away with things and others can't the fact of the matter is now I I know I know it's kind of y'all wake up just for a second the the fact of the matter is some people are just lacking something some that thing down in the heart that that tells you that something's wrong to do right and and you know you could you want to just kind of grab somebody by the little pill and shake them and say that's wrong but what what we what we really need is the that teacher in our heart to tell us that that something's wrong or right we were standing out there in the parking lot last Sunday talking about what how do you know what music is right or wrong well you know you could argue all day long whether a particular song is right or wrong or whatever but you know when you get the Holy Ghost it'll tell it'll tell you how long your dress needs to be it'll tell you how long your hair needs to be and whether you need to cut it or not it'll tell you those things it'll lay it out because it's the conscience inside of your heart that wants to go align itself with the word and it'll tell you it'll tell you that's right it speaks so brother R said I challenge you to let Jesus Christ come in here and try to do it one time think about that I challenge you to let Jesus Christ get in your heart one time and then try to wear makeup and then try to look like the world CU once once Christ comes in that changes everything it changes because now you got you got you got a real a real red light stoplight whatever to to to um to to guide you and he said brother you'll be so condemned you'll back off and shake your head from that thing just as certain as I'm standing here C he's holy listen I'm quoting the scripture if you love them things that's the world that things of the world is because the love of God is not even in you and questions and answers he said say say well I believe on the Lord I don't have condemn my it don't condemn my conscience no other no wonder you haven't got nothing to condemn right they say well dancing don't hurt me drinking a little sociable drink wouldn't hurt me because there's nothing in there to hurt telling dirty jokes wouldn't bother me because why there's nothing in there it'll hurt now now see you you know you hear somebody just kind of blurred out a little some little nasty little joke or something just just like what and you wonder you wonder all sorts of things but listen as for me in my house we're going to try to be holy we're going to try to line up according to the words cuz I got I got a red light and we you got to you got to line up to that and questions and answers brother R said someone said not long ago said brother Randon we don't need anybody to teach us when the Holy Ghost comes we don't need anybody to teach said the Bible says you don't need teaching I said then why did the Holy Spirit set in the church teachers see he set the church in order we got to have teachers but you ought to have don't have to teach you saying now listen what he's saying it don't have to you don't need a teacher to teach you Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not swear you need a teacher to teach you to bring you up the statue of a perfect man and so forth but you don't need a teacher to tell you not to commit adultery and not to cuss you don't need a teacher for that you already know that your very conscience of the Holy Spirit tells you it's wrong to do that your very conscience tells you it's wrong to do that so what's a good conscience your conscience is it's leading you like on the on the left we got this path of things that in the darkness that'll grab you and take you over that way on the right clear a clear and a sound mind and you're you're walking through life now now see this is the the kind of the picture that brother Brown's painting for us you start off on that journey and we're trying to maintain a clear good conscience and not get derailed by something not get derail not pulled off like using a minister for example pulled off the path by money and women and popularity CU there's where your conscience gets snared up and it's it's going to mess you up now brother R said I and I perceive that thou art a prophet and I got like two minutes so we're going to wind up on this he said if I never see you again I have to say that I've tried to be honest before people and before God now that's what Paul's talking about that's the scripture that we're laboring on to be honest he said meetings I realize there's been so much pressure put on meetings for money and if that is something that ought not to be done I found three things that hurts ministers first first his money then popularity when he begins to think he's something then that's when he's on his Road out now you think how simple it is to get derailed you start finding out that people like you or don't like you and it derails you because you start putting your confidence in those things instead of the word of God I I we my wife and I take a we we walk a lot of times in the evenings and we walk by this giant church and every time I'm just like wow this look all these people people going to this church yet uh the other day we were in a church for a little um for a recital and and and it was we were just looking around at this big church and how beautiful it looks and everything and and you got all these people attracted to it and they and what it is is they've changed their teaching to attract a lot of attention a lot of people and there's where you get derailed right popular popularity or money money where what if what if somebody offered you and and I'm using real examples here a lot of money to go preach at a certain Church where God might be calling you to preach at a little small little church where somebody can really get the Holy Ghost but you're swayed by the money see where the Love of Money becomes the root of all evil somebody might dangle a big old money bag in front of your face and say well I'll give you a bunch of money if you'll just do this and then you don't have a good conscience anymore you've given it all away instead of staying right with the word of God and I'm running out of time so we'll just stop there I hope this was a blessing to you God bless you [Applause]
