[0:00] we are going to now embark on a
[0:04] journey through the seven
[0:08] seal in the
[0:10] Bible but we have to set a basis like I
[0:13] said before for those of you that are
[0:15] late if you need any of these if you do
[0:18] not have a seven seal book that is
[0:20] Personally Yours that you can bring to
[0:23] class I have some you can have if you
[0:26] feel like you need to put an offering
[0:28] there're about 250 a piece I think put
[0:30] it in the offering and we'll order some
[0:31] more so the one with the blue cover is
[0:33] the same thing the one with the blue
[0:35] cover is the same thing the only
[0:36] difference is the old ones the ones put
[0:40] out in the 70s and the 80s is the pages
[0:43] are different it's a different um
[0:46] um page
[0:53] number there's more there's about 10 of
[0:55] them back there on the Shelf but you
[0:57] need to bring it every service from now
[0:59] on
[1:01] every service from now on right
[1:04] everybody right everybody every service
[1:07] from now on we going to have to kind of
[1:09] scoot around let more come in and sit
[1:10] down thank the lord we may have to do it
[1:15] out I would wouldn't bother me AIT I'm
[1:19] sweating like a horse right
[1:24] now start all right let's turn to
[1:27] Malachi 4 because we got set a basis of
[1:31] what we're going to be this may last all
[1:35] year which is fine with me that's a good
[1:40] subject all right Mal
[1:45] four cuz a lot of people don't
[1:47] understand why we know why brother
[1:50] brandham came he came
[1:52] to bring a gift of healing but that
[1:55] really wasn't what he come
[1:57] for um he came to tie up all the Loose
[2:01] Ends but that really wasn't his message
[2:05] folks that had already been
[2:07] preached he come to bring us the
[2:09] mysteries of the Bible that no one had
[2:11] looked upon no one had saw no one had
[2:14] been able to understand from the time
[2:17] that Jesus walked on the earth when in
[2:19] Matthew 24 he went through the seals six
[2:23] of them and him being the literal
[2:25] seventh seal himself which was the son
[2:27] of man standing on the Earth
[2:30] Reeve trying to reveal himself but at
[2:32] that time he was not able to reveal
[2:36] himself because the word had really not
[2:38] even been written at that time cuz
[2:41] remember the word wasn't written until
[2:42] after Jesus died we're talking about the
[2:44] New Testament right the Old Testament
[2:47] could not do that in that it didn't have
[2:51] the power not the Old Testament word but
[2:53] the Old Testament had the blood of bulls
[2:55] and goat that would cover sin but not
[2:58] take away sin all right so the Old
[3:00] Testament could not produce a change of
[3:03] the body we know it was in tyght with
[3:06] Abraham and people like that he had a
[3:09] body change but that was en tyght that
[3:10] was something God allowed to happen to
[3:13] show that it's going to happen in the
[3:14] end time but he told Daniel he said seal
[3:17] up all these things until what until the
[3:19] end time right and this is the end time
[3:23] so God had to come and restore all
[3:26] things according to Joel God had to come
[3:29] and Joel to and show us that the word
[3:32] would be eaten down eaten down and that
[3:34] there would be a restoration back
[3:36] to the book of Acts because the book of
[3:39] Acts was the original Church the book of
[3:42] Acts had power and demonstration the
[3:44] book of Acts had the word of God in its
[3:47] pure form when I say that they did not
[3:49] believe in a eternal hell they did not
[3:52] believe in a father son Holy Ghost they
[3:54] believed in one true Living God they did
[3:56] not baptize in the name of Father Son
[3:58] and Holy Ghost no one was ever baptized
[4:00] that way
[4:01] until about 300 ad where the Nan fathers
[4:05] begin to come in and erode our eat the
[4:07] word
[4:08] down but let's read and see in Malachi I
[4:11] know maybe this is Elementary to some
[4:14] but uh at least some on the internet are
[4:16] enjoying it cuz get some good comments
[4:18] about it so if if it becomes old to you
[4:21] then then you need a
[4:23] Revival cuz this thing should this this
[4:25] word should not become old to anybody
[4:28] right cuz even in Malachi 45 and 6 every
[4:31] time I read it I really get to see
[4:32] something different or something new out
[4:36] of this that we've quoted probably since
[4:38] we've been
[4:40] children everybody can quote Malachi
[4:43] 4 behold I will send you Elijah the
[4:47] prophet before the coming of the great
[4:49] and Dreadful day of the
[4:50] Lord and he shall turn the heart of the
[4:54] fathers to the children stop who was
[4:58] that
[5:00] that was John the
[5:01] Baptist he turned the heart of the what
[5:05] did it say the fathers to the children
[5:07] what was it the Old Testament fathers
[5:10] those old Isaiah
[5:12] Jeremiah
[5:14] Ezekiel Abraham
[5:17] Moses John came to turn Those Old
[5:22] Testament people into
[5:26] fathers to the children what the ACT
[5:30] 238 young Christian is starting a new
[5:34] era a new time all right faith of the
[5:37] father's Old Testament to the faith of
[5:40] the children in the New Testament not
[5:43] something new but yes it was something
[5:44] new something never been done before God
[5:46] had never resided in the heart of man
[5:49] until the book of Acts like he wanted to
[5:51] now he would come on those Old Testament
[5:53] Saints and anoint them and they would do
[5:56] the works of God but they never were
[5:58] sons of God like God wanted them to be
[6:01] they never were Daughters of God like
[6:03] God wanted them to be they always had
[6:04] flaws they always had something that
[6:06] would get in their way so John come to
[6:10] do what he come to stand in between to
[6:11] introduce the fathers to the children at
[6:14] that time he introduced Jesus Christ
[6:16] Jesus Christ come had that life in him
[6:19] had to die to release that life and then
[6:21] that life came back on the book of Acts
[6:23] to Children the 3,000 downstairs now the
[6:26] 120 in the upper room they were we're
[6:28] going to get to that in just a second
[6:30] but they were at a different level
[6:32] because they had to come out and preach
[6:33] what Jesus preached the 3,000 downstairs
[6:36] heard one sermon and got
[6:39] converted because they knew some that
[6:42] this
[6:42] man Jesus Christ had come from heaven
[6:46] and died for their sins that was the
[6:48] basis so that's babies that's down here
[6:50] acts 238 brother rown said babbling
[6:52] babies and that's what they were they
[6:53] were speaking in tongues what does the
[6:55] baby do when the baby's little it
[6:56] rattles off and just starts it can't
[6:58] control itself and there a lot of things
[7:00] that it does but once that baby grows up
[7:03] and comes into a
[7:05] father his voice changes he can talk
[7:08] plain he doesn't do the thing the baby
[7:10] things that he used to do he doesn't
[7:11] make the mistakes that he used to do
[7:13] that he used to make so it he shall turn
[7:16] the heart of the fathers to the children
[7:18] that was John the Baptist and the Heart
[7:20] of the children to their
[7:22] fathers now what is it this is the
[7:26] second part that's literally the part
[7:29] that the Prophet is bringing us brother
[7:31] brandham Jesus Christ through a man
[7:35] called William brandham bringing the
[7:37] heart of the children now back to that
[7:40] Pentecostal 1906 isza street that go
[7:43] back to them babbling babies again cuz
[7:45] we had to have a book of
[7:49] Acts
[7:51] John Christ on the scene book of
[7:55] Acts right then we had to come back in
[7:57] the end time and we had to see a book of
[7:59] acts had to happen
[8:01] again then we had a John the Baptist or
[8:04] the spirit and power of Elijah which was
[8:06] brother brandham coming to introduce
[8:08] Christ just like John introduced Christ
[8:10] to the world brother Bram introduced
[8:12] Christ to the world all right now
[8:14] everybody that's kind of that's slow and
[8:16] Elementary but we need to get that down
[8:18] because that's what this two- part is
[8:20] turn the heart of the fathers to the
[8:22] children John was bringing that Old
[8:23] Testament over to the New Testament now
[8:26] what was brother brandom doing he was
[8:28] taking the heart of those babbling
[8:30] little babies those Pentecostal babies
[8:32] back in 1906 where they couldn't control
[8:34] theel they'd stand up speaking
[8:36] tongues they do a lot of things they had
[8:38] gifts but sometimes they'd use them
[8:40] wrong I didn't say the gift was wrong
[8:42] they would use them wrong they use them
[8:43] in the wrong time brother Bram was
[8:45] trying to get those
[8:47] babies over now to the faith of the
[8:51] Pentecostal fathers the original
[8:53] Pentecost all right so lest I come and
[8:56] smite the
[8:57] Earth with a cur curse now see that lest
[9:02] I come and smite the Earth with a
[9:05] curse what Earth are we concerned about
[9:09] this ball of Earth or are we considered
[9:11] considering our own
[9:13] Earth you better consider your own Earth
[9:16] so I read that L lest God does something
[9:20] he's going to Smite this
[9:22] Earth with death what's the last
[9:25] curse the curse of sin is what death so
[9:29] we're all going to die unless we are
[9:31] turned back to
[9:33] these fathers that started this
[9:36] Pentecostal age back in
[9:40] ad33
[9:43] ad30 everybody understand so
[9:46] far because see now let's brother
[9:50] brandom in the lay out of see Church age
[9:52] I keep fing with me cuz this is a good
[9:55] man see I got to where now I used to
[9:57] have to write a bunch of notes now I'm
[9:58] just preach off for one quote and I just
[10:00] leave us in my Bible and it'll give me a
[10:02] thought and I'll just go to preaching on
[10:03] it
[10:04] so the Lord sure does help
[10:07] us let to see in church a not uh
[10:10] 3:27 Church A's book now this messenger
[10:13] of Malachi 4 and Revelations 10:7 so he
[10:17] he he links the two together so he's not
[10:19] talking about John the Baptist he's
[10:21] talking about the Elijah in the end time
[10:23] this Elijah right is going to do two
[10:26] things one according to Mal Malachi 4
[10:29] for he will turn the hearts of the
[10:31] children to the fathers Pentecostal
[10:32] Babylon babies 1906 of street to the
[10:36] faith of the fathers where Paul and
[10:38] Peter and James and John and all those
[10:41] were standing at where they would say
[10:44] Silver and Gold Have I None but such as
[10:46] I have I give unto thee arise out of
[10:48] your bed and
[10:49] W people were healed in the shadow of
[10:52] them passing by they believed those
[10:54] people so much because they acted like
[10:57] Christ so much they live literally knew
[11:00] they had been with Christ that's why
[11:01] they call them Christians they were
[11:03] called Christians in Antioch the Bible
[11:05] says because they had been with Christ
[11:08] they saw that in those people they saw
[11:10] enough in Peter to know that Peter had
[11:13] something that he didn't have
[11:15] before see they had all these virtues
[11:17] Faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[11:19] patience God brother kind they had all
[11:21] that indwelled into them now what made
[11:24] them different they were with the word
[11:26] himself for 3 and 1/2 years they were
[11:28] with Jesus Christ he talked to them he
[11:30] told them things and the Bible says they
[11:33] held these things in their heart and
[11:34] they did not understand them but when
[11:36] the Holy Ghost fell on them on I mean on
[11:39] the day of Pentecost what happened all
[11:43] that became
[11:44] quickened they thought in their mind and
[11:47] they went back and they remembered what
[11:49] Jesus had told them and that all come
[11:52] back the holy spirit quickened all those
[11:55] three and 1/2 years and that put them
[11:57] where they weren't babbling babies
[12:00] Peter could stand on the day of
[12:01] Pentecost and say men and Brethren this
[12:04] is that spoken of by Joel The Prophet
[12:07] that this Jesus who youve crucified has
[12:10] been made both Lord and Christ in other
[12:12] words he's come down now in a group of
[12:15] people and we're ready to give it out to
[12:17] you and then somebody stands in the
[12:19] 3,000 and says well Bible says he was
[12:22] pricked in his heart in other words he
[12:23] said how can I have what you have what
[12:26] Peter say
[12:27] repent he say the message of the hour he
[12:30] said
[12:31] repent if you don't repent you don't
[12:33] believe the message of the hour all
[12:35] right repent and be baptized in the name
[12:37] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[12:38] your sins and you shall receive the gift
[12:41] of the Holy Ghost all
[12:43] right
[12:45] now so what brother brandom did this is
[12:47] where the big part in the me people in
[12:49] the message hold to this that from 1947
[12:53] to
[12:54] 1963 you couldn't believe all that
[12:55] brother Brown said because God hadn't
[12:57] come to him that's a bunch of balone
[13:00] he was born a prophet when he was born
[13:02] again in the
[13:04] 20s he was a prophet with a born again
[13:06] experience all right and in 1933 God
[13:10] confirmed that by coming down on the
[13:12] Ohio River and telling the whole world
[13:14] that this man he didn't the no time did
[13:18] see people misquote that brother BR in
[13:21] no time ever says that that angel said
[13:24] you will forerun the second no always
[13:29] that says your
[13:31] message see that separates the message
[13:33] and the messenger right that makes it
[13:35] the days of the voice of the seventh
[13:37] angel all right he said your message
[13:40] will forerun the second coming of Christ
[13:42] not you right but now Elijah was in that
[13:45] man the spirit and power of Elijah was
[13:47] in brother brandom mhm to do what to be
[13:50] a vessel to be a conductor a trumpet
[13:55] that God could pick up and sound what he
[13:57] wanted all right and then he laid the
[13:59] trumpet down well what happened then the
[14:01] trumpet message now is what's taking us
[14:03] on to the
[14:04] Rapture but brother Bram from 1947
[14:07] really to I say in 1960 when brother
[14:11] Brandon went across the curtain of
[14:13] time he saw the Saints and he saw the
[14:17] ones that had gone on and he asked that
[14:21] angel he said who are these people he
[14:22] said well there your
[14:24] convert and he said well did did Paul
[14:27] make it say now here's identification he
[14:30] said did Paul make
[14:31] it angel said sure Paul made it he said
[14:35] well I know I'll make it because I
[14:36] preached what Paul preached now what did
[14:38] Paul
[14:39] preach what was Paul in his Revelation
[14:42] he was right there at the faith of the
[14:44] father right so brother random to me was
[14:47] identifying to himself the angel was
[14:50] identifying to him saying hey you've
[14:52] made it back to that spot because see
[14:54] right after that he preached Act of a
[14:55] perfect man right after that he preaches
[14:58] foken word Original Seed so really he's
[15:01] moving his way up to that 1963 part to
[15:05] where we're going to get to
[15:06] now the messenger does two things so
[15:10] this messenger Malachi 4 doesn't just
[15:12] turn the heart of the Pentecostal babies
[15:15] to the
[15:16] fathers that's supposed to be the first
[15:19] thing we get see that's why we're living
[15:22] way past back everybody thinks we're way
[15:24] up in The Headstone forget it people if
[15:27] we don't act like the book of act act we
[15:30] hadn't made it to the book of Acts yet
[15:31] that's right that's right okay that
[15:33] don't mean we have to do signs and
[15:35] wonders every time we walk by Peter and
[15:37] James and them didn't either but when
[15:39] they needed God he was
[15:44] there now this message of Malachi 4 in
[15:47] Revelation 10:7 is going to do two
[15:49] things one according to Malachi 4 he
[15:52] will turn the hearts of the children to
[15:53] the fathers does everybody understand
[15:55] that part brother Bram it the word had
[15:57] been eat down so by had in that Catholic
[16:00] age that fourth age till they almost
[16:03] killed all the
[16:04] Christians but when Luther came out he
[16:07] had just a little bit of light the just
[16:09] shall live by faith Wesley had a little
[16:11] bit more now we got to start cleaning
[16:13] oursel up all right Luther could smoke a
[16:17] pipe Wesley couldn't that's right all
[16:19] right see how God's moving up right then
[16:21] you got a Pentecostal age to where the
[16:23] Holy Ghost and the gifts came back on
[16:25] the church mhm right the Holy Ghost come
[16:28] himself in the fullness of the
[16:31] baptism that was the messenger of that
[16:33] age the oneeyed black man but it was the
[16:34] Holy Ghost in the man teaching the word
[16:37] of God but remember from 1906 to
[16:41] 1912 they still taught a father son Holy
[16:44] Ghost baptism they still taught a
[16:46] Trinity right even though the Holy Ghost
[16:48] fell on that winking at man's
[16:51] ignorance but about 192 the oneeyed
[16:53] black man started coming out and
[16:55] preaching that there was one true and
[16:56] living God Bishop Hayworth and all those
[17:00] Haywood come out if you'll read if you
[17:02] some of those songs that we sang if
[17:04] you'll look over there in the heading he
[17:05] wrote some of those like Mighty God is
[17:08] Jesus the prince of peace is he I think
[17:10] he wrote that song one of those he wrote
[17:13] himself they come down to the basis of
[17:15] one true and living God what God was
[17:16] moving
[17:17] up so in 1933 brother Ram comes on the
[17:20] scene still got a bunch of Babylon
[17:23] babies he's preaching and the women get
[17:25] up and start prophesying and speaking in
[17:26] tongues right in the middle of the
[17:27] service and and he has to call him down
[17:30] and he's trying to get the church calm
[17:31] down well what's he doing he's trying to
[17:33] take those Pentecostal babies just like
[17:35] it says here and bringing them up to the
[17:38] faith of the fathers again back to where
[17:41] Peter James John Paul and all those
[17:43] people were having all these virtues all
[17:45] these virtues got lost now it wasn't
[17:48] that the people were lost during that
[17:50] time they had the Holy Ghost in their
[17:53] soul but they didn't have the word of
[17:55] God in its truth and power to even teach
[17:58] these things things you got to have
[17:59] somebody get to that level before you
[18:01] can teach that level and there was
[18:03] nobody at that level even Luther and
[18:05] Wesley was not at they might have had
[18:07] some of these verses but they were not
[18:08] at the top of the pyramid where they
[18:11] could actually preach it to the people
[18:13] because remember you can go no higher
[18:14] than your messenger so brother randam
[18:16] had to be carried in 1960 back across a
[18:19] curtain of time he come back across and
[18:21] said he had preached what Paul preached
[18:22] and the angel verified that and the
[18:24] people verified that because they said
[18:26] we're resting on that all right but see
[18:29] that
[18:29] still did not conclude all of the
[18:32] prophet's message because if we did that
[18:35] then we have to go to another message
[18:37] and then we have to go to another piece
[18:39] of place of dying and we have to go to
[18:41] this and we have to go to that all right
[18:43] but we want to take a Rapture with the
[18:45] body change we better get back to
[18:47] something different than what they had
[18:48] in the ages because all those people
[18:50] that saw brother BR behind the curtain
[18:52] of time were Earthly
[18:54] dead they were in the grave their bodies
[18:56] in the grave brother Claude and I were
[18:58] talking yesterday and it's a real good
[19:00] point or Friday I guess it was a real
[19:03] good point that that was brought up
[19:05] between our
[19:06] conversation because in the Garden of
[19:09] Eden brother Brown said all of our
[19:11] bodies were in the Garden of Eden in the
[19:13] Earth all of our bodies were in this
[19:15] earth in the every man that ever
[19:19] Liv all right now what was God going to
[19:21] do his perfect plan was remember brother
[19:23] Brown talked about Adam body coming up
[19:25] out of the earth look like roots of a
[19:27] tree you know I mean he's making a point
[19:29] it's not literally Adam was a physical
[19:32] biological tree right but God brought
[19:35] those 16 elements together and made a
[19:37] man out of what the Earth that's right
[19:40] took that Genesis 126 and put it in that
[19:42] man right that's what God wanted to
[19:46] do now what's God
[19:49] doing now you and I are not being spoken
[19:51] out of the ground we're being permissive
[19:53] will we're being born by our parents by
[19:56] sex but that wasn't the original plan no
[19:59] but they eat out of the ground and
[20:01] that's what made you exactly the parents
[20:04] eat out of the ground and that's what
[20:05] made you that's my mother I'm getting to
[20:07] that okay so here comes Adam up out of
[20:11] the ground he I mean Genesis 126 goes
[20:14] into that man right that is a Son of
[20:19] God right correct that's a Son of God
[20:22] that's what God wanted now what
[20:25] happened let's just go through the plan
[20:27] then what happened Eve
[20:29] what happened to Eve she had her natural
[20:31] womb polluted but her womb up here was
[20:33] the first thing that got
[20:35] polluted then it just created the ACT
[20:37] where God could never do that until like
[20:41] I said about Genesis 3:15 the most
[20:43] important scripture in the in the in the
[20:46] Bible he's going to come without the
[20:49] male and female getting together now
[20:51] like they're having to all the way down
[20:52] through time and what's he going to do
[20:55] he's going to create that body out of
[20:58] what 16
[20:59] elements but it's true like Mom said
[21:02] down Through the Ages they ate out of
[21:04] the same ground your body was still in
[21:05] this ground that's what I'm saying God's
[21:07] plan was not messed up at
[21:09] all it was just not that that man when
[21:12] it comes straight up out of the ground
[21:13] that that Genesis 126 went straight into
[21:15] that man that don't happen now what you
[21:18] have to do is you have to come through
[21:19] Mom and Daddy now through the beding
[21:22] ground come up and God knows you're
[21:24] going to accept it by predestination and
[21:27] then what does he do
[21:29] same thing that he wanted to do in the
[21:30] Garden of Eden here comes that Genesis 1
[21:34] right into you at the new birth but the
[21:36] problem is here's the problem problem
[21:39] before the fall Adam was okay his body
[21:41] was being renewed he was not
[21:44] sinful
[21:46] okay it would have been changed see we
[21:49] were all going through go through a
[21:50] change
[21:51] anyway regardless I don't think God was
[21:54] going to raise up a Immortal body and
[21:57] then put that genes that's not what he
[21:59] done to Adam God can't change his mind
[22:02] about his plan that's right so Adam was
[22:06] in a body that was not Eternal yet but
[22:07] it would have been what changed in the
[22:09] moment in the twinking of a night and he
[22:12] would have become
[22:13] Eternal now what happened the devil
[22:16] stopped that from happening right so we
[22:18] brought sinful flesh up these bodies
[22:21] will die these bodies pass Adam see Even
[22:25] Adam died after he took on what his wife
[22:28] gave him he died a natural death right
[22:31] that's not what God wanted but now
[22:33] what's God going to do at the end
[22:35] time he's going to have two
[22:38] groups he's going to have the group
[22:40] that's going to stand that takes the
[22:44] chain that Genesis 126 man is going to
[22:46] be so real in that human manle it's
[22:48] going to change that very being but then
[22:50] you've got your people that are laying
[22:52] in the ground now what's going to happen
[22:54] to
[22:55] them their body's going to come out of
[22:57] the ground God's going to take that
[22:59] Genesis 1 from the sixth Dimension and
[23:02] bring it right back into that body and
[23:03] do the same thing you wanted to do to
[23:04] start with so Satan didn't stop God's
[23:08] plan God's plan still goes on and on and
[23:10] on he's going to have exactly what he
[23:13] wanted in the Garden of Eden he's going
[23:14] to have that exact
[23:16] plan at the end time but the prophet had
[23:19] to do two things and the reason he had
[23:20] to do two things is the first thing is
[23:23] that sinful body would still
[23:26] die now not saying that the person was
[23:28] sinful but the sinful body the sin curse
[23:32] the curse was still on all through these
[23:35] ages and the sin curse is still going on
[23:37] today we go to funerals so we know that
[23:41] even godly people are still dying right
[23:43] so that means that that person's not
[23:45] dead they're just laying the body back
[23:47] in the Earth where it came from right
[23:50] all right then there's a hole put on
[23:52] it that the real man goes in the sixth
[23:54] Dimension and then they come back
[23:56] together here right
[23:59] okay so they're not really dead they're
[24:01] just sleeping right all right God's
[24:03] putting them to rest but God required a
[24:06] group of
[24:08] people to be able to do like Adam would
[24:11] have done had it not been a fall was to
[24:13] stand in a place to where that his body
[24:15] would just be
[24:17] changed literally his atoms would be
[24:19] changed from falling down to Eternal so
[24:24] that's why this man of Malachi 4 had to
[24:25] do two things he had to restore the
[24:28] world back to the faith of the fathers
[24:30] 1960
[24:31] 6162 he was bringing it back God I don't
[24:35] say brother Brown God was bringing it
[24:37] back brother brand would always say not
[24:39] in the years of preparation now not
[24:41] saying that he was wrong no no no it
[24:45] took that Foundation to get you to this
[24:48] place all right see that's we've been 40
[24:51] something years just just preaching
[24:56] Foundation let's be honest there's not a
[24:59] lot of people that's got all those Seven
[25:00] Virtues working in their life like Paul
[25:03] like
[25:06] Peter okay so it took 40 something years
[25:09] for us to even get a mindset when we can
[25:11] start thinking about it right but
[25:14] brother brandom did both those things
[25:15] while he was here he had to and then go
[25:17] off the scene and then in the days of
[25:19] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[25:21] begins to sound the mystery one mystery
[25:24] there's only one mystery
[25:26] left and that's the change of these
[25:28] bodies right right one mystery left how
[25:32] God can look at me and come from a
[25:34] sinful act not a sinful but but one that
[25:38] was allowed right but a sinful condition
[25:42] and then without dying I can just within
[25:45] a moment's notice be 20 years old and
[25:47] never have another pain never have
[25:49] another problem never have another hair
[25:50] Fallout and be totally Eternal that to
[25:53] me is a mystery yes all right now two he
[25:59] will reveal the th the mystery of the
[26:01] seven thunders in Revelations 10 which
[26:04] are the revelations contained in the
[26:06] Seven Seals so what is the seven
[26:08] Thunders it's a mystery of God that
[26:10] contained in Seven Seals that man never
[26:13] was able to look on remember brother
[26:15] randam had the dream remember he whipped
[26:17] the top off of that pyramid Mountain
[26:19] what was he doing he was knocking the
[26:21] top off looking down inside and he said
[26:24] man had never looked on this
[26:26] before but now they one man that was
[26:29] looking at it so we couldn't say that
[26:30] any longer brother Brandon when he
[26:32] whipped that top off see it became open
[26:37] right it will be these divinely revealed
[26:40] mystery truths that literally turn the
[26:41] hearts of the children to the
[26:42] Pentecostal fathers literally and we
[26:45] preached on that before literally means
[26:47] it it's done just as is all right so
[26:52] this messenger of Malachi
[26:54] 4 he preached two messages from 47 to
[26:58] about 61 62 63 he was bringing a group
[27:02] of people he was bringing the word back
[27:04] into Power sure he was still going on
[27:06] the healing campaigns he was do all that
[27:09] but even the angel told him said that's
[27:11] not your that's not your
[27:13] message this is just a what bait on the
[27:15] hook to draw the people in to get the
[27:17] what the message not the healing sure
[27:20] thank God for the healing but see even
[27:23] here in
[27:26] Malachi see talking about him with
[27:28] healing in his wings in verse two you
[27:30] read the whole
[27:32] chapter see that's what a healing
[27:35] campaign had to come up
[27:37] first
[27:39] Malachi let's read it Malachi
[27:44] 1:2 but unto you that fear my name shall
[27:47] the son of righteousness arise with
[27:50] healing I'm sorry 14
[27:55] 14 shout the son of rightous shall arise
[27:59] with healing in his
[28:01] wings and ye now that makes it personal
[28:04] you shall go forth and grow up as cows
[28:07] with a stall what what does a cow
[28:13] do what do you do in a
[28:16] stall you store
[28:18] food why does a cow come to a stall
[28:21] because a stall is where the food is
[28:24] that's what God's telling you he's right
[28:26] here he's telling you that this that
[28:27] this Messengers going to come with a
[28:29] healing
[28:30] campaign and then ye shall go forth and
[28:33] grow up as cows with a stall brother
[28:35] brandham said he saw the vision of the
[28:38] food being stored up right so that's
[28:41] what happens the healing campaign come
[28:43] to get to people
[28:45] in to what the stored food and you shall
[28:48] grow up as Cales of stall and you shall
[28:51] tread down the wicked for they shall be
[28:52] ashes Under The Souls of your feet in
[28:54] the day that I shall do this say the
[28:56] Lord remember ye the law of Moses
[28:58] my servant what the Ten
[29:02] Commandments
[29:04] remember the law of Moses so we're not
[29:07] doing away with the Old Testament we're
[29:10] not doing away with the New Testament
[29:12] we're not bringing some new
[29:14] doctrine brother brandham said you know
[29:16] somebody said about those seven Thunders
[29:18] he said brother brandham that's
[29:20] something that's not in the Bible you
[29:21] could write a 23rd Book of Revelation he
[29:24] said in other words he said they were
[29:26] trying to trap me
[29:28] but you go back to revelation 22 says if
[29:31] you add to this book or take away from
[29:33] this book you got problems so he said no
[29:37] he said it'll be what's in the book so
[29:40] the seven Thunders the Seven Seals
[29:41] everything we need for our journey on
[29:43] this Earth to change our body is inside
[29:45] that Bible that you hold in your
[29:50] hand it just took a
[29:53] messenger from God to come down to to
[29:56] deliver the pure word of God like it had
[29:58] never been preached before since Jesus
[30:01] was on the
[30:02] earth brother brandham literally
[30:05] preached the same three and A2 years
[30:08] that Jesus preached brother brandham
[30:11] didn't preach it in Parables yet it is
[30:13] in
[30:14] Parable John saw it in symol in
[30:17] Revelations
[30:18] 6 he didn't have the revelation of it
[30:22] brother brandham came and brought the
[30:24] Revelation to you and I and now what
[30:27] we're going to do is is we're going
[30:29] to that 47 to
[30:32] 63 is a foundation a lot of us have been
[30:36] in the message a good long time I assure
[30:39] you you'll know whether you got the
[30:40] foundation or not because you're the
[30:43] only one that knows it you know whether
[30:45] you're living right you know whether
[30:46] you're doing the right things because
[30:47] the first seal shows the mystery of
[30:50] iniquity iniquity is something that
[30:52] you're doing that you know you shouldn't
[30:54] do and you're doing it anyway if you
[30:57] can't get past that
[31:00] you're dead right this is life or death
[31:03] literally that's right so we're going to
[31:05] start I want you to bring your seal
[31:07] books with you and your Bibles for the
[31:10] next few months or weeks or years orever
[31:13] how long we' not got anywhere to go for
[31:16] the next few weeks so we'll get started
[31:20] we will start at
[31:21] Revelation
[31:23] 5 we'll probably start in the breach or
[31:26] somewhere in there but all right
[31:28] I don't have any notes yet so I'm just
[31:30] looking back over some old notes from a
[31:32] long time ago but um just keep it in
[31:35] prayer you wants to read just read read
[31:37] Revelations 5 and 6 read the the
[31:40] Revelations chapter 5 and chapter
[31:46] 6 in Wings
[31:49] be sorry Eagle
[31:53] age
[31:54] right absolutely
[31:58] that showed that eagle anointing where
[31:59] he would fly over and have a healing in
[32:00] his wings and then fly on over and be
[32:03] able to deliver the message cuz remember
[32:05] people we can't do away from 47 to 63 if
[32:08] you don't understand that then you can't
[32:11] get 63 to
[32:14] 6 okay go bless you
