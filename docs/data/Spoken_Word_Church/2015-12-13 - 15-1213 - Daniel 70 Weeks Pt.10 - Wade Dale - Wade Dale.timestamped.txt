[0:00] and according to the Bible we're going
[0:02] to put it in here now look look listen
[0:06] why don't start on Sunday all time just
[0:09] for illustration purposes on the
[0:13] beginning here because remember the
[0:16] first day of nisin are a bit started
[0:19] when you were coming up to the end of a
[0:22] dark which is there near last month of
[0:25] the Jewish calendar two people would go
[0:28] out look if they didn't see the moon and
[0:30] that's what confused me at first but it
[0:33] doesn't confuse me now because you say
[0:35] will you if you add another 30 days
[0:36] you're pushing it no you drop back and
[0:39] go through the same month again because
[0:42] if you added another month you wouldn't
[0:44] be pushing it forward you go back and
[0:46] start it eight are one again and come
[0:49] back so you you live the same month you
[0:51] don't live the same month you just put
[0:53] 30 days here but it's 30 days twice in
[0:56] the last month didn't depend on the
[0:58] calendar like we did no they don't
[1:00] nothing they depend on the moon stars
[1:02] and all that remember me then you know
[1:05] they may have a calendar but it didn't
[1:08] look like this for sure how they write
[1:11] why did it because you would name you
[1:13] would think you would think in a dar if
[1:16] they didn't see the moon if they saw
[1:19] sliver they started the next month if it
[1:21] was a dark side of moon they just drop
[1:24] back and started this all over again hey
[1:27] are one is not a tower third can't week
[1:29] because it would push it this way no
[1:32] they drop back and do a tower again go
[1:34] see if you did add another one you start
[1:37] pushing your feast days out of the
[1:40] spring all right so they just drop back
[1:43] and see that keep sitting that keeps it
[1:46] in line nobody got that same after that
[1:48] to me that's very simple you go now here
[1:53] we got we got more months on the
[1:55] backside but the ones that are really
[1:56] important i wrote the dates down now
[1:58] let's reading on leviticus 23 now look
[2:01] and the lord spake unto moses saying
[2:03] speaking to the children of Arizona
[2:04] saying to them concerning the Feast of
[2:06] the Lord these are not Israel thief
[2:10] these are the Lord speaks that he come
[2:13] and Israel to that required them to keep
[2:17] so they're not feast of Israel their
[2:20] Feast of the Lord is what the Bible says
[2:21] Feast of the Lord which ye shall
[2:24] proclaim to be holy convocations even
[2:27] these are who my feast all right six
[2:31] days shall work be done with the seventh
[2:33] day is the Sabbath of rest now see
[2:34] there's only one day that's a salad
[2:37] there's only one day that they're
[2:39] required to keep in that Saturday their
[2:41] Sabbath this saturday nobody got that
[2:45] number seven days our Sabbath is on
[2:47] Saturday that's why Jesus had to come
[2:50] off the cross because really right
[2:51] here's where he was crucified they
[2:52] couldn't take him off that cross the
[2:54] next day because you can't do anything
[2:55] on this Sabbath this is the only day
[2:58] they were required r 7 is the Jewish
[3:01] name for it okay six days shall work be
[3:04] done but the seventh day is the Sabbath
[3:06] of rest and holy convocation and
[3:08] convocation means to call together all
[3:11] right okay if I get too fast we'll
[3:16] finish it will go a little bit later but
[3:18] I want you to get this in yet and you in
[3:20] your cranium for a little one these are
[3:22] the Feast of the Lord verse 4 even holy
[3:24] convocations with ye show proclaiming
[3:26] their seasons and the fourteenth day of
[3:29] the first month and eating them remember
[3:33] six o'clock starts their day 6 p.m.
[3:36] evening 6pm starts to jewish day 12
[3:41] midnight like we do alright so if they
[3:44] even is the Lord's Passover on the
[3:46] fourteenth and a look here's nissen
[3:48] let's say it starts on Sunday the first
[3:49] you come down 14 days now look if that
[3:53] Passover dead fall on the Sabbath it was
[3:56] a high holy day you got to blessings
[3:59] because you have to do anything it's a
[4:01] Passover fell over here you still went
[4:03] to work it's just in the evening when
[4:04] you at home you would eat the Passover
[4:06] there we go that those days move you got
[4:09] to remember the days moved it's like our
[4:10] days minute okay you got it but it says
[4:14] the fourteenth day of the month it
[4:16] doesn't say it says the 14th I said
[4:18] write him up in the fourteenth day of
[4:20] the first month and even is the Lord's
[4:22] Passover

[4:27] that they start it started at six
[4:31] o'clock friday afternoon got it it

[4:37] then you gotta look at your days a
[4:39] little different even on the calendar
[4:41] but that Passover started 6 p.m. on
[4:44] friday afternoon so that's the 14th day
[4:48] to them hey got it that's the fourteenth
[4:51] day of them not don't worry about our
[4:53] day I was a fourteenth day to then one
[4:55] six o'clock that's why Jesus was killed
[4:57] actually pass over fellow and friday he
[5:00] was killed before six o'clock right they
[5:03] put him in the ground which was the
[5:05] feast of unleavened bread the passover
[5:06] lamb was killed 6 p.m. after that he was
[5:11] already dead they put him in the ground
[5:13] unleavened bread then he raised on
[5:16] firstfruits he with the firstfruits up
[5:18] from the dead they got that same man
[5:20] that's according to the Bible from now
[5:23] the fourteenth day of the first months
[5:26] were silent evening is the Lord's
[5:27] Passover and on the fifteenth day of the
[5:30] same month is the feast of unleavened
[5:32] bread right here here we go nothing hmm

[5:40] unleavened bread so for seven straight
[5:42] days you'll eat unleavened bread you

[12:57] Jordan half day you got to remember the
[12:59] night day at six o'clock starts patek
[13:02] day but same from evening to even write
[13:06] to me that part was confusing but now if
[13:08] you'll just understand their day starts
[13:10] at 6pm when you come up with each p.m.
[13:12] they start the next day you got remember
[13:18] they're really close to the equator to
[13:20] kinda like jamaican their time don't
[13:21] change like ours does their son usually
[13:23] even in jamaica their sun goes down six
[13:25] clocks his clocks its clock 630
[13:28] sometimes might vary a little bit but
[13:30] not like ours you know i was going down
[13:32] now six cloth it's dark when the
[13:34] summertime it nine o'clock is still
[13:36] daylight three hours swing when you get
[13:39] closer to the equator remember equator
[13:42] stays right here but when it turns this
[13:44] goes away from the schneider goes toward
[13:46] the Sun but your pivot point is right
[13:47] about the equation so it kind of stays
[13:49] so their days stay pretty much six
[13:51] o'clock he gets started gets dark Frodo
[13:53] they change the time that we're over
[13:55] here I don't think that not Jamaican
[13:57] does not so I don't think they do it do
[14:03] I know some of our state's don't like
[14:05] Indiana faint other things
[14:08] so I think it's just left up really the
[14:11] one grids and they change it is because
[14:13] of school kids getting on the bus at
[14:15] darden getting home at dark know like
[14:17] stuff if you left it the same way that's
[14:19] why they call it daylight savings time I
[14:21] can remember when it wasn't remember in
[14:25] the early 60s I remember when they
[14:26] didn't have daylight saving time but the
[14:29] kids you know two three accidents or
[14:30] something happened it being dark dark
[14:32] dark one kid killing the bus take kids
[14:34] get on bus against daylight now six
[14:35] clocks is burning all right look here to
[14:38] started going bust em up know them but
[14:40] now you if you left it an hour back up
[14:44] then you know kids you get on a darksome
[14:46] now we're getting home a dark sometimes
[14:48] in the winter all right so now only how
[14:51] we got on that but we did trumpets day
[14:54] of atonement we're going right by the
[14:56] bottom now verse 34 speaking to the
[15:00] turbulence and a fifteenth day right the
[15:04] fifteenth day of this seventh month

[17:54] going to Tabernacle in us so have been
[17:57] around this message that was a trumpet
[17:59] but that wasn't the whole part doesn't
[18:01] remember the trumpet brings everybody
[18:03] together got it that was this message
[18:07] but he's not going to physically take us
[18:09] out of here his message is going to take
[18:11] us out of here the sound of the trumpet
[18:13] is what's going to bring us together

[18:37] preaching to Israel together 144,000
[18:41] together there will be a Day of
[18:42] Atonement will read it when we get there
[18:44] in Ezekiel can't remember but are in
[18:47] Jeremiah Ezekiel at Botox if I remember
[18:49] they says it that they go into their
[18:51] house and they mourn when those two
[18:54] prophets reveal Jesus Christ to them
[18:56] that they already killed him back 2,000
[18:58] years ago the Bible says they'll take
[19:00] where did you get those scars and he'll
[19:02] say in the house of my friends right
[19:04] it's not literal Jesus that's true those
[19:06] two prophets right they'll realize that
[19:08] what they'll realize they're atonement
[19:13] we realize our totalement here we r g
[19:16] we're Gentile we realize our thomann
[19:18] here they going to realize that coma in
[19:20] that 70th week you'll ever realize it we
[19:24] got to make an end and reconciliation
[19:25] for iniquity can you remember third
[19:28] anyway the first three guy the first
[19:33] read the first six fold the seats full
[19:34] purpose the first three brains Israel
[19:37] and restores her back that's the day of
[19:38] atonement they're going to realize they
[19:40] killed him two thousand years ago and
[19:42] they're going to flick their soul that's
[19:44] what it says right here hmm and then the
[19:50] tabernacle has got to be built in the
[19:52] Millennium hmm God's already built
[19:57] higher type of that but we don't need
[19:58] one this is it right but they have is
[20:01] equal 42 44 we're reading they have a
[20:04] literal temple that they're going to go
[20:05] to these termina so then she said when
[20:12] you delete it has to be able at seven
[20:14] years they don't build a tabernacle
[20:16] after 1260 days they're just realize
[20:20] that their day of atonement Israel is
[20:23] realizing their day of a coma after
[20:24] those prophets preached 1260 days that's
[20:28] when the acoma is going to be they're
[20:29] going to be killed they're going to be
[20:30] taken up God is going to watch this
