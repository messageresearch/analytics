[2:45] happy to be here too it's you're truy
[2:46] good to see you
[2:50] today and when he had opened the second
[2:52] seal I heard the second beast say come
[2:54] and
[2:55] see and there went out another horse
[2:57] that was red and power was given to him
[3:00] that sat there on to take peace from the
[3:01] earth and they should kill one another
[3:04] and there was given unto
[3:06] him a great sword now we understand that
[3:10] that
[3:12] um combat Beast with the ox we talked
[3:15] about that last Sunday all right so I
[3:17] don't think we shouldn't have to go over
[3:18] any of this let's kind of go one step
[3:22] further and look at the horse the horse
[3:25] being red now we know the horse was red
[3:28] now let's turn in your seal book
[3:33] to the second seal now get in the second
[3:36] seal now
[3:40] okay and let's go to page 173 our
[3:44] paragraph
[3:48] 175 in the second seal all right make
[3:51] sure you're in the second seal if in his
[3:53] first s you will
[3:55] be
[3:57] okay it's page 173 if you've got this
[4:00] regular book but it's paragraph
[4:03] 175 180
[4:06] the can't be 175 just give a paragraph
[4:10] number yeah paragraph
[4:12] 175 everybody got it where it says what
[4:16] was
[4:17] it got
[4:28] it oh I'm sorry my glasses are horrible
[4:31] paragraph
[4:34] 115 I can't see a thing with these
[4:36] glasses on why do youall think when I
[4:39] was preaching last Sunday I was down
[4:40] there with you so I could figure out who
[4:41] was here and who was
[4:43] not I couldn't tell who was
[4:48] here think that's a joke it's really not
[4:50] these glasses are for reading and their
[4:52] heart's not very good for reading
[4:54] anymore now y'all finally got the right
[4:58] paragraph
[5:00] how are you huh 51 and
[5:05] Le well that look like 175 but it's 115
[5:09] all right so we're here now what was
[5:11] it now we're talk he was talking about
[5:13] Moses
[5:15] Moses went out to deliver the children
[5:18] of
[5:19] Israel right he goes up to Pharaoh he's
[5:23] got the power of God in his hand he's
[5:26] got the word of God in his mouth he
[5:29] drops that snake down and the snake does
[5:33] what I mean the the rod turns into a
[5:36] snake then he's then Janice and jambus
[5:39] which is an
[5:40] impersonator the impersonators come in
[5:42] they drop theirs down and they become a
[5:44] snake too they were just magicians all
[5:46] right they didn't cause that to happen
[5:48] they were just magicians you see it you
[5:50] know even now people doing magic like
[5:52] that and slide of
[5:55] hand but Moses now what could Moses
[6:00] do what was it it was a showing that
[6:03] every genuine thing of God the devil has
[6:05] got an
[6:06] impersonator for it they impersonate to
[6:09] throw the people off the track now what
[6:12] did Moses do say well I guess I made a
[6:14] mistake I better go back no he just
[6:16] stood still for he had carried out his
[6:19] commission to the
[6:21] letter now go to one
[6:25] 18 now Antichrist comes in light
[6:28] gradually
[6:30] excuse me now what did he come in first
[6:33] White
[6:35] calm cool white righteous Church
[6:40] everything's okay we're going to be all
[6:41] right let's just put church and state
[6:43] together and then when he got that
[6:45] established in the
[6:46] people then what
[6:49] happened as God moves higher the devil
[6:52] moves with him just like he said right
[6:53] here the impersonators were always there
[6:56] the impersonators are always with you
[7:00] mhm right so we're not immune from this
[7:05] the white righteous Church the little
[7:07] attitudes that we have sometime maybe
[7:09] may seem
[7:11] righteous but in God's eyes are
[7:13] they okay are you know in God's eyes are
[7:16] they are we trying to get somewhere I
[7:18] think about this weekend um we went over
[7:20] J's dad's for this for the weekend just
[7:23] had a time to kind of sit down and
[7:25] relax and I thought you know is it works
[7:28] is it something is it how many quotes we
[7:30] read a day or how much is it that have
[7:32] we come down to that I don't think
[7:36] so is it is it something we got to
[7:41] do if it's works then Paul said that's
[7:45] dead but but by my faith you're going to
[7:47] see my
[7:48] works okay so what's happening in the
[7:51] message now is there's a lot of
[7:52] impersonators that are doing the
[7:55] works like I said last Sunday they got
[7:57] the mechanics and everybody in this
[8:00] message has got the mechanics because
[8:02] they can
[8:03] read listen people when I was 14 years
[8:06] old I knew it was sex in the garden I
[8:09] could read that in the in the Bible and
[8:12] from what I saw what brother brandham
[8:13] said but did I have a revelation no I
[8:15] just had head
[8:16] knowledge you know why cuz my fruit
[8:18] showed
[8:19] different up until so many years ago
[8:22] right I had a head knowledge of this
[8:25] message at 14 years old that never left
[8:29] me but it was just head knowledge it was
[8:32] just
[8:33] mechanics that's we don't want that we
[8:37] don't we got to have the mechanics you
[8:39] got to have it there but you got to have
[8:42] the Dynamics on top of that mechanics we
[8:45] got to get the two together just like
[8:46] remember uh Constantine got the church
[8:48] and the state together we've got to get
[8:50] the word and the spirit together all
[8:52] right and start believing that what this
[8:54] says is true and then what act on it in
[8:58] the book of Acts what did they do they
[8:59] acted on what Jesus taught them for 3
[9:02] and 1/2 years those 120 went out and
[9:05] acted on what he had
[9:07] said cuz they knew what they knew the
[9:09] Holy Ghost was already come they knew it
[9:10] wasn't coming it was already there same
[9:13] way with you and I same way with this
[9:16] these
[9:17] seals the change of the body my point is
[9:19] the change of the body is already
[9:23] here like dad's been preaching on the
[9:25] adoption the understanding of the change
[9:27] of the body is here now let's go a
[9:30] little bit higher
[9:32] then all right you got mechanics but no
[9:36] Dynamics you can have mechanics with
[9:40] Dynamics like I said upstairs be born
[9:44] again but remember I read the quote out
[9:46] of that out of that true seed will come
[9:48] a group of
[9:50] people that's going to have mechanics
[9:53] and
[9:54] Dynamics not different than when you
[9:57] were born again
[10:01] but a higher
[10:04] Revelation everybody understand because
[10:06] when you
[10:08] when you people don't understand
[10:10] sometimes when you say well we got
[10:11] mechanics and no dynamics that means we
[10:12] got just a word and no Spirit no if
[10:15] you're born again this me this somewhere
[10:18] and Quicken what you heard whether it be
[10:21] just a little that of
[10:24] God everybody understand so we don't
[10:27] we're not walking around with no
[10:31] Dynamics we're walking around with
[10:33] partial
[10:35] Dynamic we need perfect Dynamics cuz the
[10:38] perfect Dynamics is going to change this
[10:41] body right cuz brother Brandon had an
[10:44] understanding of the change of the body
[10:47] right Paul had a understanding that
[10:50] somebody was going to be
[10:51] changed but they didn't have the
[10:54] Dynamics of that time it wasn't time yet
[10:57] the Dynamics was not on that d on that
[11:00] mechanic I'm trying to do if dad and him
[11:03] still leaving in a couple weeks I'm
[11:05] going to do both Sunday services and
[11:07] speak on for and latter rign cuz it
[11:10] needs to be brought out to where you can
[11:12] understand that like I said Sunday when
[11:14] we're talking about things down here
[11:16] sometimes you you can take me wrong just
[11:18] like just like some people did or
[11:20] sometimes they took brother brandom
[11:22] wrong cuz he said well you got mechanics
[11:24] but no Dynamics now that's not exactly
[11:28] the truth
[11:29] do you understand because if you got the
[11:32] Holy Ghost if you're born again
[11:34] somewhere the mechanics you heard met up
[11:38] with the Dynamics of God and he sparked
[11:40] that little bit of of word that you held
[11:42] in your heart that's what happened on
[11:44] the day of Pentecost but now did they
[11:46] have the
[11:47] fullness no they might have had 10%
[11:52] octane where we got to have 100% octane
[11:55] everybody understand it was gas there's
[11:58] different grades of gas gas right
[12:00] regular midgrade and premium well let's
[12:04] just make an analogy we need to be in
[12:06] the premium grade and quit filling up
[12:08] with the regular right cuz a regular you
[12:11] still
[12:12] get like brother Brown said you get a
[12:14] little spark knocking but you use that
[12:17] premium
[12:18] grade we'll get out of here it'd be hard
[12:21] to put regular gas in a
[12:25] rocket it's fuel it Sparks it
[12:30] burns but you won't put regular gas in a
[12:32] in a rocket no you put rocket fuel but
[12:36] guess what it's Dynamic everybody
[12:39] understand all
[12:42] right so
[12:47] now I don't need it today you can have
[12:50] it
[12:51] all my bu sisters
[12:57] or old and not cold warm it
[13:00] warm but you
[13:04] see I don't what I want you to realize
[13:06] is right
[13:08] here Pentecost this is my the next quote
[13:12] Pentecost was true right 1906 ofuda
[13:17] Street the Holy Ghost fell on what they
[13:19] had the word they held the Holy Ghost
[13:21] fell on that and they were born again
[13:24] Believers in the body of Christ sealed
[13:27] away for the age correct let's look down
[13:30] in this next paragraph
[13:32] 121 and look what brother Rand
[13:35] saying let's go excuse me to
[13:40] 120 now the first church when the
[13:43] Catholic Church says that they were the
[13:44] first the original Church they're
[13:45] exactly right they were they began at
[13:48] Pentecost that's where the Catholic
[13:50] Church began now I once didn't hardly
[13:52] believe that till I read history and
[13:54] found out it's right they excuse me they
[13:57] began at Pentecost but they they begin
[13:59] to drift and you see where they're at
[14:01] all right does everybody understand
[14:03] where he's going listen and if
[14:04] Pentecost drift with a speed is drifting
[14:07] now and they won't have to go 2,000
[14:10] years it's 100 years from now they'll be
[14:12] farther away than the Catholic church is
[14:14] that's right right let me say this if
[14:18] this message keeps going on the way it
[14:21] is it'll be in worse shape than the
[14:24] Pentecost and it is already in worse
[14:26] shape than the
[14:27] Pentecost everybody understand but now
[14:30] that Pentecost was true don't say that
[14:32] Pentecost was false that Pentecost was
[14:34] true the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[14:36] fell on the word that they had for their
[14:39] day so don't discount those people
[14:42] that's like in this oage you think boy
[14:44] those people they they were just very
[14:46] weak people they just died here no they
[14:48] were a very powerful group of people for
[14:51] their age that's right cuz the call was
[14:55] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you
[14:56] should be saved be filled with the Holy
[14:58] Ghost and they had signs and wonders but
[15:01] they gave their life for what they
[15:03] believe all right Satan was there but
[15:07] what he had done is he had moved from
[15:09] that white righteous church now let's
[15:12] go to
[15:19] page paragraph sorry
[15:23] 141 watch how Satan moveed now I want
[15:26] everybody understand you understand you
[15:27] can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[15:29] Every Day Life and die and go to hell on
[15:31] your spirit but if you're ever born
[15:33] again in your soul you do have the spark
[15:35] of God but you may be that sputtering
[15:38] car that he was talking about remember
[15:40] we talked about it upstairs
[15:42] Sunday you be born again but you can
[15:45] declare
[15:47] yourself to go toward the change of the
[15:49] body or hey this is all I can do and die
[15:52] and go by the grave but you one of the
[15:54] two is going to happen or one of the
[15:56] three you're either going to realize you
[15:57] lost didn't have to start with you're
[16:00] going to realize that that you don't
[16:03] have enough
[16:04] Faith or you going to realize that
[16:06] you're the one that's going to be
[16:07] changed those are the three groups of
[16:09] people that's the only three I want to
[16:11] worry about this world I'm telling you
[16:13] people it gets more more
[16:17] unreal as the weeks go
[16:19] on look how powerless those people up
[16:22] that East Coast was boy they got some
[16:23] real powerful people a lot of money a
[16:25] lot of things a lot of big stuff a lot
[16:27] of lot of mansion but guess what one
[16:30] little puff from Irene and they went you
[16:32] know they went in the water well that's
[16:34] just a that's just
[16:36] a that's not even a firecracker compared
[16:39] to what's going to
[16:42] happen and how are they going to be able
[16:44] to handle it in how are we going to be
[16:47] able to
[16:48] handle how are we going to be able to
[16:50] handle that one day we ain't got a place
[16:51] to
[16:52] live can't get gas everybody's preparing
[16:55] for this that and the other all they got
[16:56] to do is take the gas away from us and
[16:57] we ain't got nothing that's right
[16:59] I mean you may put some food up if you
[17:00] want to that's fine and dandy but if you
[17:02] don't got no gas where you going to go
[17:05] what are you going to
[17:07] do gas is
[17:10] everything petroleum products is more
[17:13] than just putting gas in your car mhm
[17:17] right but let's just prepare now just
[17:20] get in
[17:22] word had a good idea the other day you
[17:25] know all the Indians and Muslims or
[17:27] whatever they are bought up
[17:30] all anywhere you go that's who owns he
[17:34] said you know that's could very easily
[17:35] say hey you don't believe the way we
[17:38] believe we don't
[17:41] see and they own every one of them we
[17:43] went in a store the other day that was
[17:45] in
[17:46] Greensboro down where we used to hunt
[17:48] and this old man and woman used to own
[17:50] it and I walked in there and there was
[17:52] an Indian Running mhm Indian owner and
[17:55] he wouldn't take credit
[17:56] card so okay that's your check but
[17:59] that's the truth
[18:02] though but now watch watch how Satan
[18:05] moves what we're trying to do is we're
[18:07] not trying to reveal
[18:09] Satan we're trying to reveal what God
[18:11] has done and to expose what the devil
[18:14] does in our life exposing I know brother
[18:17] Brandon one time says and even the Bible
[18:19] says the wicked one would be revealed
[18:20] reveal means to make known or to it but
[18:23] we're want to expose this guy we want to
[18:26] expose this fell we don't want to we
[18:27] don't want to you know sugarcoat it we
[18:29] want to expose him get him out in the
[18:31] open all right cuz you know what we can
[18:34] deal with him then because what he's
[18:35] doing it through these seals he's
[18:38] hiding in the Deeds the doctrines he's
[18:42] hiding himself I don't care how much you
[18:45] know it's like I said it's works works
[18:49] works get born again first The Works
[18:51] will come I'll promise you that all
[18:54] right
[18:56] paragraph one let's read one
[18:59] 140 now remember the the paragraph above
[19:02] that let's read it cuz that's what dad's
[19:04] been on God's first decision is perfect
[19:07] and the way he chose to do things there
[19:08] can't be no other better way he can't
[19:11] improve on it because it's perfect to
[19:13] begin with so now is God changing
[19:17] because of the devil's
[19:18] tactic no Satan changes because of he
[19:21] sees what God's people's doing he can't
[19:24] understand
[19:26] it he can't understand us that's why he
[19:29] hates us he's understood down Through
[19:32] the Ages but a group of people's going
[19:34] to take a body change see that's the
[19:35] only hold he's got he's got one
[19:39] hole that he's a squatter on this Earth
[19:41] and he can take remember God told him
[19:43] said you will eat the dust of the earth
[19:46] your Serpent and the dust you'll eat the
[19:49] rest of your life well serpents don't
[19:50] eat dust but what did that Ser Point did
[19:53] God tell him God told him you're going
[19:54] to take this away from the human bre
[19:59] this is dust you're going to eat this
[20:01] dust until somebody comes Jesus Christ
[20:06] right we just got to realize one thing
[20:08] that whatever Jesus done it's already
[20:10] finished over with and completed we just
[20:12] got to realize
[20:14] it
[20:16] right now let's skip on down you can't
[20:18] say he learned more he didn't learn more
[20:20] he's very F of all wisdom our wisdom
[20:22] here comes from Satan paragraph 140 We
[20:25] inherited inherited it from Eden where
[20:28] we swapped off faith for wisdom Eve did
[20:31] now he was first called Antichrist all
[20:34] right remember the first the first he
[20:36] was
[20:37] Antichrist all right cuz he was against
[20:39] the word of God even though it was a
[20:41] white righteous Church remember he was
[20:42] he was the Antichrist now the second
[20:45] stage he is called the false prophet
[20:47] because that Spirit among the people
[20:49] became
[20:50] incarnate right you remember the White
[20:53] Horse now had no Crown when he started
[20:55] but then he would was given a crown why
[20:58] he was a nickan spirit to begin with
[21:02] then he became incarnate in a man he's
[21:04] talking about a pope and then he was
[21:06] crowned and received the throne and was
[21:08] crowned and when he served that for a
[21:10] long time as we'll see the seals break
[21:14] and then we find out after that long
[21:15] time Satan was kicked out of heaven he
[21:17] came down according to the scriptures
[21:18] and enthroned himself just think
[21:19] enthroned himself in that man and became
[21:22] a beast now he's talking about going you
[21:23] know later on so
[21:27] now
[21:29] let's stop right there so s so now it
[21:30] went from Antichrist to false prophet
[21:32] because what does a false prophet do
[21:34] what did Bam do bam preached the word of
[21:37] God to a
[21:39] degree bam was a prophet even though he
[21:42] was false he was a prophet the Bible
[21:45] says false prophets will come in the end
[21:47] time false preachers false prophets all
[21:52] right
[21:55] prophesying of things to come
[22:00] Satan's always wanting to do what
[22:02] brother Brown said what's what does man
[22:04] always do he's looking for something to
[22:07] come or saying well that was good back
[22:10] there and forgetting that God's right
[22:14] here right that's Satan's tactic even
[22:17] with me and
[22:18] you remember like Sunday if you prophesy
[22:22] that oh man there's a group of people
[22:24] that's going to take a body change then
[22:25] you're
[22:26] dead you're dead you just killed
[22:30] yourself because you're prophesying of a
[22:33] group of people to
[22:36] come right you're prophesying of a group
[22:39] of people to come and that puts you out
[22:41] of that
[22:42] group so you die those who prophesy must
[22:46] die because they're prophesying of
[22:47] somebody coming but when that one person
[22:50] when you know when they prophesied of
[22:51] Jesus coming then we stood on the earth
[22:53] he said I am here I am the resurrection
[22:56] before Abraham was I am
[22:59] well not that flesh they were looking at
[23:01] but the man inside of there that
[23:02] theophany God was there the whole
[23:05] time that's why he could tell them
[23:09] things now where's that the offing God
[23:15] now he in heaven looking you know
[23:17] walking around waiting on something to
[23:21] happen no he's in the bride he's in
[23:25] Bride form now I don't even like to say
[23:27] that we're different because we're we're
[23:29] this is God in Bride form this is not a
[23:33] bride that's become another form of
[23:35] God this is God in Bride form this makes
[23:38] it positive this is God it's not God
[23:42] coming not God will do something no it's
[23:45] God in Bride form right
[23:46] now cuz he was in what father son Holy
[23:51] Ghost if you and I have the Holy Ghost
[23:53] that's the three dispensations of God
[23:56] but this end time people has one more
[23:58] thing that we got to deal with and
[24:00] that's this guy out here nobody else has
[24:01] had to deal with this
[24:03] man this this flesh person all
[24:06] right we'll read that in just a little
[24:09] bit we'll read
[24:10] it but he now is a false prophet because
[24:13] what can he do now remember the first
[24:16] age or the first seal he was not crowned
[24:21] yet but a crown was given brother R said
[24:22] it had to come into a a being a person
[24:25] then that you can't Crown spirit
[24:29] so now there's a man there and it's
[24:31] Crown all right now what's that man
[24:34] doing watch him
[24:36] develop same Rider different horse
[24:39] remember the horse is the power that the
[24:41] people give it cuz if people would have
[24:43] rose up and said hey we're not killing
[24:45] these Christians it wouldn't have happen
[24:47] but but what happened that false prophet
[24:50] the Antichrist false prophet is a person
[24:53] they they put a head up there put a
[24:54] crown on top of him and then what
[24:57] happened was this became more
[25:00] powerful than
[25:02] this because the written word of God
[25:04] said
[25:06] this but the Pope says this or the
[25:09] Catholic Church says this
[25:14] why if this overtakes you this is more
[25:18] powerful
[25:20] right the word of God is more
[25:23] powerful okay and we know it's a person
[25:25] we know it's Jesus Christ we know all
[25:27] that but if it's not in you it's
[25:30] powerless same way with Satan it's
[25:33] powerless unless that word is made
[25:36] manifest in somebody and and we believe
[25:39] that when God spoke it can't come back
[25:42] void it can't be changed or made any
[25:46] different okay but now Satan changes
[25:48] watch him he'll change four times why he
[25:51] couldn't get them all in the White
[25:53] Horse can't going he ain't going to get
[25:55] them all in the red horse he's not going
[25:57] to get them all on the black horse but
[25:58] he's going to get them all in the Pale
[26:00] Horse all of his people that is his his
[26:02] subject
[26:03] okay but what was he to do take peace
[26:07] and
[26:07] kill and the red horse was R riding
[26:11] through the blood of 68
[26:13] million Martyrs that he killed but he
[26:15] killed more brother Bown said
[26:18] spiritually he killed more than he did
[26:20] physically why because the doctrine went
[26:22] forth it got amongst the people there's
[26:24] your false prophet because a false
[26:26] prophet is somebody that now stands here
[26:28] and preaches the word of God and you
[26:30] accept it as
[26:34] Doctrine you accept the word as a
[26:36] Doctrine and it becomes part of
[26:39] you then Satan does what he kills
[26:43] you takes peace and
[26:46] kill this is divide and
[26:48] conquer why you see the old Pope doing
[26:51] this you know that's not a victory sign
[26:52] that's divide and conquer he's taking
[26:55] peace and he's killing so the fourth
[26:58] age next week we're going to talk about
[27:00] the
[27:02] blood and how that that works in
[27:06] sanctification but how it took that
[27:08] group of
[27:09] people that was in this Dark
[27:13] Age and shows how that you and I are
[27:16] going to
[27:18] overcome I hope we can get to that next
[27:21] Sunday if not maybe the following Sunday
[27:26] but we'll get into those people
[27:28] how that they you we we have to take
[27:30] those four combat beasts and we have to
[27:32] connect with all four of
[27:34] them those four combat beasts were given
[27:37] to the bride I believe to get us out of
[27:41] here cuz brother brandham said after the
[27:43] four seal he said I knew the Rapture
[27:44] took place cuz in the fifth seal you
[27:46] don't see the combat Beast anymore where
[27:48] were they they were in the
[27:50] bride and you don't see them
[27:53] anymore so that must mean the bride's
[27:56] gone pretty simple but it was very
[27:58] profound because nobody ever realized
[28:01] that that the four combat beasts were
[28:03] actually given to the Bride of Jesus
[28:06] Christ to get us out of
[28:07] here cuz let's surmise one
[28:10] thing if we're
[28:13] gone somebody took a body chain that's
[28:16] right so somebody's got to do it whether
[28:19] we read scripture or whether we do
[28:21] anything we know after the foreal if
[28:23] we're not seen
[28:25] anymore then somebody come to
[28:28] place all this comes to adoption all
[28:31] this comes to the higher form of
[28:33] justification sanctification baptism
[28:34] holy all this that's why that the red
[28:37] horse I mean the White Horse red horse
[28:39] and Pale Horse mix together I mean the
[28:41] black horse mixed together makes the
[28:43] Pale
[28:44] Horse justification sanctification
[28:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost makes way for
[28:47] the Holy Ghost himself which is going to
[28:49] do one thing and that's change your
[28:52] body cuz you can't do
[28:54] it Abraham couldn't do it but one day he
[28:58] woke up and it happened so that's just
[29:00] the same way with you and I walk in the
[29:04] word know that we're Justified I want us
[29:07] to really understand if you if you don't
[29:09] know that you've been Justified and all
[29:11] of us have a problem that's we all can
[29:14] remember our past we all can remember
[29:16] the things that we've done but remember
[29:18] God
[29:21] came you know if I was God I'd be
[29:23] scratching my head and I'd say why are
[29:24] you thinking
[29:26] of why why you thinking that I took care
[29:29] of that a long time
[29:30] ago
[29:32] okay but I know that's but see the devil
[29:34] has one inroad he can come down through
[29:36] your brain right and you lived it that's
[29:39] right that's why I said that's why that
[29:42] I'm like Dad I just cannot see us having
[29:45] any form of eternal life while we were
[29:46] doing the things we were doing we were
[29:49] Sinners lost even Paul says we were
[29:52] alienated from the Commonwealth of God
[29:55] we were alienated from anything of God
[29:57] life now if Paul could realize that why
[29:59] don't people in the message realize
[30:01] that we were lost I did what I did cuz I
[30:05] didn't have God to right but he began
[30:10] your body change once he took that same
[30:12] body and turned
[30:15] it like I've said many times before this
[30:17] hand held many well I didn't drink beer
[30:19] a lot but this hand did things it wasn't
[30:22] supposed to
[30:24] do the one finger sign and all that
[30:26] stuff that was s same same
[30:29] hand same
[30:31] mouth but what did God do he began your
[30:35] body you begin your body change when
[30:37] you're begin when you're born again
[30:39] because your body begins to become
[30:41] subject to the one inside of you it was
[30:45] before subject to the one that was
[30:47] inside of you which was the devil right
[30:49] all right but then it becomes subject to
[30:52] the one inside of
[30:54] you and sure we make mistakes because we
[30:56] have a spirit Spirit we have a human
[30:59] spirit that we have to deal with which
[31:01] is memory reason we reason memory our
[31:04] memory from before conscious we should
[31:07] have a better conscious affection and
[31:09] things like that and
[31:12] Imagination but what if you took
[31:15] that what if you took that and said okay
[31:18] my memory
[31:20] comes
[31:22] okay I realize I did that but the real
[31:25] me didn't do that the real me the real
[31:28] one inside of me never sinned when that
[31:30] New Birth when he lit my soul with the
[31:33] new birth that clean my
[31:36] slate now we're just trying to get this
[31:38] guy that's why that we we don't smoke
[31:40] drink cuss run around you know do all
[31:43] those things because what's inside of us
[31:45] is now taking over this that's right cuz
[31:48] like I said this is the same person you
[31:50] saw 15 years ago that that did vile
[31:53] things but God started changing from the
[31:55] inside out that's right
[31:58] what the problem is in the in the other
[32:00] ages they never had enough
[32:03] understanding of the word of God a
[32:06] deeper depth of
[32:08] Revelation to believe this is it I'm
[32:10] telling you whole thing in a nutshell
[32:14] I'm talking about Paul irenius Martin
[32:16] all those they prophesied they look
[32:18] toward something but they knew there was
[32:20] a group that was coming and that was
[32:23] their problem they couldn't believe
[32:25] enough of the word of
[32:28] God because they didn't understand the
[32:30] word of God
[32:31] enough cuz it says to whip are to
[32:34] understand the Redemption of the body
[32:36] they never got to there was only a few
[32:38] people brother random got to that stage
[32:40] of the understanding but he didn't make
[32:43] the change because it wasn't for his
[32:45] time it was for you and I the way I see
[32:48] the whole thing the natural types
[32:51] spiritual said the whole thing is a
[32:54] growth experience from the the church
[32:57] church back there was aorn baby at so
[33:00] they got baby F they were babbling
[33:02] babies and each age came
[33:06] y but it's time to eat strong meat
[33:09] though it's time to understand it's time
[33:12] to be justified truly and say God you're
[33:15] the one that did this I know I did wrong
[33:17] things in my life I know I did horrible
[33:19] things in my life but God I know that
[33:22] you didn't count it to me and if I
[33:23] hadn't to come the way I come through my
[33:25] mom and daddy i' never never done that
[33:28] cuz the real me never did it that's
[33:31] where you got to realize those two we
[33:33] actually let me tell you something in
[33:34] our mind right now we're two people
[33:36] that's right right come on let's realize
[33:38] that everybody on the internet too we we
[33:40] are two people that's right and that's
[33:42] the
[33:43] what that's the
[33:45] fight we're two people we got a human
[33:49] side and we got a spiritual side we
[33:52] still lean to this thing rather than to
[33:55] this one that's right because we think
[33:57] this one is more real than this one cuz
[34:01] we can look at it and touch it and feel
[34:03] it right right is that the truth now we
[34:07] got to
[34:08] realize brother D's fixing to get on to
[34:11] it now that's right this is more
[34:14] real than this right have and when we
[34:17] realize that guess what this is going to
[34:19] take over this and we got to realize
[34:21] we're not two people that's right we're
[34:24] one
[34:25] person the theophany of
[34:28] God before the foundation of the world
[34:31] that's what we were we were the
[34:33] theophany of God and now he separated
[34:35] himself
[34:37] out just like we talking about you know
[34:39] with children he's got his children out
[34:42] here now like I said Sunday I believe
[34:44] the 144,000 are already here I believe
[34:46] the two prophets are here I believe the
[34:48] people's ready to take a change of the
[34:49] bodies here and there's really no other
[34:51] person you need to look for right Jesus
[34:53] Christ is already here the judge is
[34:55] already come right
[34:57] what did Brother Brown say he said we
[34:58] get our judgment here what was he
[35:00] telling
[35:01] us right you don't judge a soul that's
[35:03] born again it's already been judged this
[35:06] is what we're judging in 1963 when that
[35:08] judge came down he brought the what the
[35:10] seals for the Judgment of this thing
[35:12] right here the
[35:15] Bible the the Paul irus all those
[35:18] prophets they judged our
[35:20] soul with the word of God but nobody
[35:23] ever was here to judge the
[35:25] body but Jesus Christ had to come he's
[35:29] the only one that can judge the body
[35:30] remember he's the only one that can can
[35:32] judge the body while we're alive down
[35:34] here I'm not talking about when we go on
[35:36] cuz remember when people go on and come
[35:38] back they're already judged what they go
[35:41] through they didn't go through anything
[35:43] different we just got to realize that
[35:44] our our two Natures that we're fighting
[35:48] one day's got to come together that's
[35:50] right and we got to quit fighting
[35:52] ourselves cuz really that's what you're
[35:54] doing CU if the devil's just something
[35:56] on the side of the road that just
[35:59] affects you and that's all he done he he
[36:02] affected
[36:03] people he had no power remember all this
[36:06] was given to him power was given power
[36:09] was given so take that wig in you
[36:12] whatever it's word try to use it we are
[36:15] not two
[36:16] people we are
[36:22] not because if we are two people one of
[36:24] them is
[36:25] Antichrist
[36:27] say that again again that's why we have
[36:30] problems with
[36:31] ourselves say that again if we are two
[36:33] people one of them is Christ and one's
[36:35] the Antichrist
[36:37] remember that's why we're anti against
[36:40] the word of God that's why we got to
[36:41] become one
[36:44] point
