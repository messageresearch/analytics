[0:13] Matthew
[0:16] 11 verse
[0:26] 12 now what I know the last the last
[0:30] last few times that I I taught Sunday
[0:32] school we um we got into kind of the
[0:35] third pool and and the we talked about
[0:38] the the three measures of meal just the
[0:42] the the word of God filling you up until
[0:45] you uh are just so full of him that well
[0:48] we can take we can take a a body change
[0:51] that it changes our whole being that the
[0:53] the things of our of uh of this world is
[0:56] die off and we're purged until we come
[1:00] uh to be more and more like him not a a
[1:04] like a rigid statue but something living
[1:07] in In His Image and um you know uh I I
[1:12] got to thinking about how when when God
[1:14] reveals something to you and he it's
[1:17] almost like he takes you up into the
[1:19] into the heavens and then brings it back
[1:22] down in a in a real simple way so we
[1:26] kind of got into uh you I I I don't
[1:30] it's almost when people say it's so deep
[1:33] things are deep that I struggle with
[1:35] that sometimes because when God reveals
[1:37] it to you when he brings it down to
[1:40] where you can understand it then it's
[1:42] not deep anymore it's something that you
[1:44] can comprehend and you can get excited
[1:46] about it because you begin to realize
[1:48] what God is showing you what God is
[1:51] doing and and I got to thinking about
[1:54] how God has that's how he has always
[1:57] worked in the Old Testament he took
[1:59] Moses up into a high mountain and he
[2:01] showed him he he Moses said let's build
[2:05] we're going to build the Tabernacle
[2:07] build build everything the way that I
[2:09] saw it in the mountain so God showed
[2:13] Moses uh something he took him high up
[2:16] and showed him a s showed him the plan
[2:20] the Plan of Redemption in the Tabernacle
[2:21] the plan of how it should be in the
[2:23] wilderness all those things and then
[2:24] Moses brought it down he came down and
[2:28] showed it to the people in a way that
[2:29] they could understand even though they
[2:31] didn't understand in the fullness like
[2:33] you know they didn't understand all the
[2:35] types and shadows but he brought he he
[2:37] brought down the Revelation from the
[2:40] mountain and you think about Jacob when
[2:43] he fell asleep and he had a dream about
[2:46] that ladder that descended from Out of
[2:48] Heaven from that the Throne of God and
[2:51] that brother R talked about and
[2:53] explained that the Angels were going up
[2:56] and coming down they go up and come down
[3:01] and brother brandom when he was out out
[3:03] west the angels caught him up and took
[3:05] him up and he caught the Mysteries and
[3:08] came back and brought it brought it to
[3:11] us in a way that it was so simple that's
[3:15] I believe that it it's was so simple it
[3:19] what the real true Revelation that that
[3:22] you know it just went so far over all of
[3:24] our heads and I know there's a there's a
[3:26] time and a play there's a time and a
[3:28] season for us to catch it and and it
[3:30] just wasn't the time then that for
[3:33] everyone to catch the Revelation but now
[3:34] as the Mysteries are being unfolded I I
[3:38] believe that it's it it's so simple
[3:41] that's what brother BR priest in Christ
[3:43] revealed in Simplicity that God can
[3:45] reveal himself in a way that he can come
[3:48] down so simple that it's almost beyond
[3:51] our understanding it's beyond our
[3:53] reasoning we if we try to reason it out
[3:55] in our own mind it just goes it will go
[3:58] too high but it's so simple the way that
[4:02] God expresses it the way that God
[4:04] reveals himself and so maybe uh uh I
[4:08] want to come back a little bit with some
[4:09] real simple scriptures that kind of I
[4:12] think illustrates the truth of what um
[4:16] what was in the three majors of of meal
[4:19] and and the different things that we've
[4:20] been talking about that you know how
[4:22] that Joshua brought the children of
[4:24] Israel into the promised land and and
[4:27] they're they're fighting like we're
[4:28] fighting our way up the stature of
[4:30] perfect man uh not that they fought the
[4:33] Battle it was really God but they had to
[4:35] hold the sword in their hand and go
[4:36] forth and and and you know against the
[4:40] all the religions of their day to quote
[4:43] all the the things that came against
[4:45] them all the all the carnal ideas and
[4:50] and just like we do in our flesh we're
[4:52] fighting against
[4:53] the Waring against uh our flesh and and
[4:58] uh our own ideas and and different
[5:01] things so I I want to start off at
[5:03] Matthew 11: 12 we'll we'll start reading
[5:07] and before we read the scripture let's
[5:09] just go to the Lord in
[5:11] prayer and make sure I turn my thing on
[5:14] my did Lord Jesus we thank you God for
[5:18] another day to serve you Lord and
[5:19] another day to be among your people Lord
[5:22] and to Fellowship in your presence Lord
[5:25] and I pray God lord there's no way that
[5:27] we can understand the word
[5:30] unless you come and reveal it and open
[5:31] it Lord I pray that you'll just come
[5:34] down this morning Lord Jesus and open it
[5:36] to us Lord and be with us this morning
[5:38] in the services Lord that you will heal
[5:40] the sick and Afflicted and the
[5:41] Brokenhearted and be with us and Deliver
[5:44] us from evil Lord we ask in the name of
[5:45] the Lord Jesus
[5:48] Christ Matthew
[5:55] 11:12 this is
[5:57] where you know John joh uh his his Eagle
[6:02] Eye had got damned as brother BR
[6:04] explained it and he was he sent out
[6:06] Messengers from prison to see if what
[6:10] Jesus was preaching was if he really was
[6:12] the Messiah the one that they had been
[6:14] looking for if if you know when John was
[6:18] the one that had saw the spirit of God
[6:20] come down on Jesus and identify him and
[6:23] remain and stayed on him and he knew he
[6:26] it was his testimony his confession that
[6:28] this is the one that we're looking at
[6:31] but then is he was all in prison behind
[6:33] the bars and his Eagle Eye kind of got
[6:34] dimmed over he was you know he he began
[6:37] maybe to look at circumstance and so of
[6:39] sent Messengers to see is this really
[6:42] the one that we've been looking for oh
[6:44] yeah and and Jesus said let let me start
[6:47] back um at verse
[6:48] 11 verily I say unto you among them that
[6:52] are born of women there ha not risen a
[6:55] greater than John the Baptist not
[6:57] withstanding he that is least in the
[6:59] king Kingdom of Heaven is greater than
[7:01] he now there's the scripture that we use
[7:04] that that you know that I I will you be
[7:07] surprised today how many believe that in
[7:09] the Old Testament they had the Holy
[7:11] Ghost uh which you know this scripture
[7:13] um plainly speaks against because if you
[7:16] are in the Kingdom of Heaven that you
[7:18] have been baptized and seal he is the
[7:21] person of Jesus Christ is living inside
[7:23] of you and you can see the kingdom and
[7:24] you're part of it then you are the least
[7:27] in that kingdom is greater than John
[7:29] because John had not come that the the
[7:32] atonement the price had not been paid
[7:34] and you see God will not dwell in an
[7:36] unclean vessel and we had to be cleansed
[7:38] by the blood of the Lamb so that we
[7:40] could be clean in Old Testament that
[7:43] cleansing and that that payment had not
[7:44] been made which is why in the Old
[7:46] Testament they could not receive the
[7:48] Holy Ghost you that that price had to be
[7:51] paid first and uh so and from the days
[7:55] of John the Baptist till now the kingdom
[7:58] of heaven suffereth
[8:00] violence and the violent take it by
[8:03] force and I I've been meditating on this
[8:05] all week and
[8:07] this this scripture has been just a huge
[8:13] blessing because of what it represents
[8:18] yeah how uh how we're supposed to
[8:21] conduct our lives and how we're supposed
[8:24] to approach approach
[8:26] him and so Jesus what's he he's telling
[8:30] everybody this is the one that you don't
[8:33] understand John's purpose his purpose uh
[8:36] and if I could par phrase a little bit
[8:38] his purpose was to get everybody in a
[8:41] frame of mind that they could accept the
[8:43] Messiah when he came right so as soon as
[8:46] John came on the scene then they their
[8:49] hearts the hearts of the people began to
[8:51] be quickened they began to become
[8:55] violently enthused to follow after
[8:58] Christ they can to what uh get in their
[9:02] mind whatever it takes for us to find
[9:05] this whatever this man is speaking about
[9:08] then that is what I'm willing to do and
[9:11] now you can go back through all of
[9:13] scripture and find out that this is how
[9:16] this is the approach that Paul talked
[9:18] about in Hebrews 11 this is the approach
[9:20] that that all down through scripture
[9:22] everyone that comes to God takes is
[9:25] because they are violently enthus
[9:28] violent is a strange word to use but
[9:31] it's a word that symbolizes you know
[9:34] someone attacking a SE somebody you know
[9:37] coming after something that maybe
[9:39] otherwise they would not be allowed to
[9:42] get and now that's the way that a sinner
[9:45] comes a sinner has no right without
[9:48] without God what right do we have to any
[9:51] of the claims WR in scripture there's no
[9:54] there's no claim that we have to
[9:56] anything that's written down if it
[9:58] wasn't for Christ
[10:00] but when John began to preach his gospel
[10:03] and the people began to catch it that
[10:05] there was something in the works then I
[10:07] believe something called in them and
[10:09] they began to to cry out just the same
[10:12] way as when brother Brandon began to
[10:14] preach when he came on the scene then
[10:17] the people you know they would sit in
[10:19] his meeting get there way early in the
[10:21] morning get show up and and put uh their
[10:25] coats on the seats and and uh Reserve
[10:28] their seats and and just uh almost get
[10:31] into fights over who who could be there
[10:36] and it's Africans and Africa sitting in
[10:39] the rain waiting uh even in Jesus day
[10:43] sitting sitting out there remember when
[10:45] he fed the the 5,000 and so forth the
[10:48] different numbers they were hungry but
[10:52] they were sitting there hungry for the
[10:54] word they didn't care about their body
[10:57] they were sitting there Desiring to hear
[11:00] the word of God because something in
[11:03] them has risen up to be
[11:06] violently violently enthused to follow
[11:09] after God now now you might think well
[11:11] that's that's an interesting
[11:13] interpretation is it an interpretation
[11:15] there's no private interpretation but
[11:18] there is private Revelation and that's
[11:20] what I I'm talking about this morning
[11:22] what I'm going to get to is private
[11:24] Revelation but let's go over to Luke
[11:27] 16 16
[11:32] let's see how Luke wrote
[11:50] that in Luke
[11:53] 16:16 Jesus said the law and the
[11:55] prophets were until
[11:57] John since that time since John the
[12:01] kingdom of God is
[12:03] preached and every man presseth into it
[12:07] now he's kind of rewarding what Matthew
[12:10] wrote down that they violently were were
[12:13] seeking after the things of God now the
[12:16] kingdom of God was preached but the the
[12:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost was not yet
[12:21] given and but so they they were pressing
[12:24] forward with the little bit of of
[12:26] understanding that they had all that
[12:27] they knew you know they they uh were
[12:30] just getting a little just had just
[12:32] enough to just keep pressing on but now
[12:35] that's the way of a a real Christian is
[12:37] you keep moving on as much as God will
[12:40] give you hang on to that and let it grow
[12:44] according to whatever the spirit will
[12:45] give you and just keep moving on and you
[12:49] know how I I I I keep saying that the
[12:51] the tortoise is the one that won the
[12:53] race slow and steady wins the race but
[12:55] now I believe that a Christian tortois
[12:58] violently tries to move a Christian
[13:00] tortoise does not sit on their recliner
[13:04] and and and you know just put on stuff
[13:06] on TV or or whatever just kind of set by
[13:08] the wayside well I'm going to church and
[13:12] brother Dale's got the Revelation so
[13:14] that's good enough for me but a real
[13:17] Christian a real Christian tortoise
[13:20] tries to get what presses forward to get
[13:23] whatever he can to to see God's
[13:27] righteousness fulfilled in his
[13:29] life pressing forward towards the mark
[13:32] of the high calling as Paul said now so
[13:36] let's let's kind of think about some
[13:38] examples in scripture of the men of God
[13:41] that pressed forward and then we'll look
[13:43] at what we pressed for and and what it
[13:46] looks what pressing forward in this day
[13:48] looks
[13:49] like so we already talked about the one
[13:52] sitting in the field Waiting on Jesus to
[13:54] preach where they they disregarded
[13:58] everything of their the natural of the
[14:00] flesh they they stopped looking at how
[14:03] hungry they were how tired they were it
[14:06] didn't matter it didn't matter it it it
[14:08] didn't matter you know if somebody would
[14:09] come and say uh horrible things about
[14:11] them and and and you know follow the
[14:13] disciples along as they begin to be
[14:15] whipped and and bruised and and bodying
[14:18] and and by people saying things those
[14:21] things didn't matter it doesn't matter
[14:23] if somebody hurts your feelings it
[14:25] doesn't matter who cares I'm pressing
[14:27] forward to the mark the high
[14:29] calling and one of the greatest stories
[14:33] of somebody who violently pressed
[14:35] forward now this is the the the stalk
[14:38] example of violently pressing forward
[14:41] because there was actual violence
[14:42] involved in this story is when Jacob was
[14:45] camped out going to meet his brother he
[14:48] was all afraid and he sent all of his
[14:50] family he sent everybody ahead of him
[14:53] and he camped out that night before
[14:55] going on and following him to meet his
[14:57] brother Esau right right and now this is
[15:01] is what I'm leading up to is Jacob was
[15:04] all
[15:06] alone and that's what I'm leading up to
[15:08] now when you think about the third poll
[15:10] and everything think about how God is
[15:13] coming to you to reveal his word to you
[15:17] it is all alone you it's you and God
[15:21] Alone there's nobody else you go to
[15:24] church and you fellowship with other
[15:25] ones but you know when it it it all
[15:27] comes down to your personal relationship
[15:30] with God just you and God because one
[15:34] day your pastor and the deacons and the
[15:37] associate pastor and everybody's going
[15:39] to have to give account for what they
[15:40] believe but you're going to stand there
[15:43] all alone because in second Corinthians
[15:45] Paul said we must all stand in the
[15:48] judgment to give account for the Deeds
[15:49] Done in the body you know you you you at
[15:51] one point you will all have to stand
[15:55] alone and now we all stand alone before
[15:58] God as we come before him we come to him
[16:00] in a secret place just like Jacob before
[16:04] he met Esau now he was all scared he
[16:07] didn't have an army to depend upon he
[16:08] didn't have anything to depend upon and
[16:11] that night he wrestled with the
[16:13] angel violence he got he got violent now
[16:18] this is a holy violence a holy violence
[16:21] that carries on into the New Testament
[16:23] where we've got to become the way that
[16:26] we approach God has to become so in so
[16:29] much
[16:30] fervor I I wonder maybe sometimes is
[16:33] this why we don't get the things that we
[16:36] need is this why
[16:40] um there's a lot more I can say on that
[16:42] but right amen you know just fill in the
[16:45] blanks is this why are we in are we
[16:52] violently seeking the things of God
[16:55] thank
[16:56] you like Jacob and and
[16:59] Jacob wrestled with the angel all night
[17:02] and he said I will not let you go until
[17:04] you give me my blessing and now that
[17:07] he's wrestling with God does God want us
[17:10] to wrestle with him I I think he does
[17:13] okay I think he wants us to to get down
[17:16] and say lord it's written in your word
[17:20] what your promise is and I believe that
[17:22] you will give it to me because you
[17:25] promised it now I I I got to think about
[17:29] all the promises of healing in the Bible
[17:31] and how that is one is such a stumbling
[17:33] block to people that healing is comes by
[17:37] faith and we don't we don't want to
[17:39] believe that but uh it this really is
[17:43] one of the it's such a controversial
[17:46] belief that if you can believe God for
[17:47] healing that he will he will heal you
[17:50] and uh it's so controversial that many
[17:52] you know denominational ministers won't
[17:54] preach it cuz they you know they want to
[17:56] preach that well sometimes God just
[17:58] don't want
[17:59] sometimes uh you know
[18:02] uh cuz we want to have an excuse we want
[18:05] to have an excuse for our unbelief but
[18:08] here's the thing of it if God promised
[18:11] in his word that all things are possible
[18:13] to them that believe that's right that
[18:16] if anything anything you can move a
[18:18] mountain if you believe it you you're
[18:20] stopwatch or your pocket watch or
[18:22] whatever will show up on your dresser or
[18:24] in your pocket if you can believe it
[18:25] that's an astounding thing but here's
[18:28] the thing of it is God said it I didn't
[18:30] say it he said it so he's obligated to
[18:33] back up his word if we'll believe it and
[18:36] if we come to him violently like that
[18:38] violently trusting storming the Gates of
[18:42] Heaven to see his promises made manifest
[18:44] in our life then I believe that he'll
[18:47] ansers if we come to him and and and I
[18:51] was reading through how brother Bram
[18:53] said you know you preach based on your
[18:56] experience and I am speaking from my
[18:59] experience this morning that when you
[19:01] come to God and you don't give up then
[19:04] he will answer your prayer I I believe
[19:06] that because my experience Bears record
[19:09] of
[19:10] that and I'mma I'm going to jump ahead a
[19:12] little bit let's go over to an example
[19:15] of that about in the Bible let's go over
[19:16] to Luke
[19:18] 11 chapter Luke
[19:23] 11 verse
[19:27] five
[19:31] can you aggravate
[19:36] God Luke Chapter 5 and he said unto
[19:39] them which of you shall have a
[19:44] friend which of you shall have a friend
[19:46] and shall go unto him at midnight and
[19:48] say unto him friend leave me three
[19:52] loaves for a friend of mine in his
[19:54] journey has come to me and I have
[19:56] nothing to say before him
[19:58] and he from within shall answer and say
[20:00] trouble me not the door is now shut and
[20:03] my children are with me in bed I cannot
[20:06] rise and give thee go away it's not a
[20:09] good time it's it's not a good it it
[20:12] doesn't fit in into the didn't a plan or
[20:15] whatever I say unto you though he will
[20:17] not rise and give him because he is his
[20:21] friend yet because of his
[20:24] importunity he will arise and give him
[20:27] as many as he need need it what is
[20:30] importunity that means he's aggravating
[20:33] he keeps banging on the door he won't go
[20:35] away he won't stop and that's what
[20:38] that's how we should approach God for
[20:40] the things we have need of my my you
[20:43] know you say my my kids aren't serving
[20:45] the lord are you aggravating God are you
[20:48] banging on the doors of Heaven are you
[20:50] on your knees constantly because you
[20:51] know brother B said we think a real man
[20:54] is somebody that got has big muscles or
[20:57] he can talk to his wife you know you
[20:59] shouldn't be you got to listen to me but
[21:02] a real man has big old bags under his
[21:04] eyes and bags under his knees because
[21:06] he's been on his knees praying that's
[21:08] right amen he's worn knees out and the
[21:12] same thing about a woman a real woman is
[21:14] somebody that's been banging on the
[21:16] doors of Heaven now now we we we like to
[21:19] make excuses for our unbelief and say
[21:21] well my kids are not serving the lord
[21:23] because uh you know this and that you
[21:26] know you can God can I believe that God
[21:28] can compensate for our mistakes and I've
[21:32] seen this happen before so many times
[21:34] where I I'll say something stupid at
[21:36] work and just just uh you know I'm
[21:39] afraid that my boss thinks I'm a just an
[21:41] idiot and I'll go before the Lord God I
[21:43] believe that you can change his mind you
[21:46] can make him think differently about the
[21:48] situation I go into work the next day
[21:50] and I'm the best thing ever at
[21:52] work now God can can compensate for our
[21:57] stupidity but if you go before the Lord
[21:59] in prayer he will he I believe with all
[22:02] my heart that he will make it right he
[22:05] if if you bang on the doors of Heaven if
[22:07] you seek him with everything that youve
[22:08] got and this is how we approach God this
[22:11] is a a the way of a Christian tortoise
[22:15] is to violently seek after
[22:18] God and and now think about how they
[22:21] they listen they listened to Paul preach
[22:23] all night until they were the the
[22:26] brother fell asleep out of the
[22:28] uh out of the third thank you the third
[22:33] the third
[22:35] day uh brother brandom out in the woods
[22:38] praying while mosquitoes are biting him
[22:40] he didn't he didn't he stopped thinking
[22:42] about the mosquitoes biting him because
[22:45] he was violently seeking after God the
[22:48] mosquitoes didn't care and that's how
[22:50] the things of this world are you know
[22:51] all these people that are talking about
[22:53] different all the world you know that I
[22:55] don't know if you heard about that the
[22:56] certain Minister that I wanton won call
[22:58] his name but been on the news lately
[22:59] because he was preaching the truth those
[23:02] little mosquito who cares about what the
[23:04] things of the world the world are saying
[23:06] right and uh and I was thinking about
[23:10] Believers testimonies that I've heard
[23:12] about that Believers praying that God
[23:14] would show them the truth that they
[23:16] would not be deceived storm in the
[23:18] windows of heaven so that God would show
[23:21] them I somebody was telling me about how
[23:23] they came to the message that they were
[23:25] up all night praying God showed me the
[23:28] truth I know it's it's out there
[23:30] somewhere and somebody laid a message
[23:31] book in their hand and because they were
[23:34] seeking something right and and just the
[23:38] idea the way of Christian tortois is
[23:41] whatever it takes whatever it costs
[23:44] remember the story of the man that came
[23:45] to brother brand seeking the holy or it
[23:47] wasn't brother brand was I believe it
[23:49] was somebody else seeking the Holy Ghost
[23:50] and they said well let's go down to the
[23:52] into the the mud mud puddle the hog pin
[23:56] and and get in there and if you're not
[23:57] willing to do whatever it takes then you
[24:00] don't have the right idea and I the the
[24:03] spirit of this age lead AA is that we
[24:06] just get relaxed that that we're not
[24:09] willing to do whatever we're not willing
[24:12] to pray all night anymore brother R
[24:14] scolded us for not even be willing to
[24:16] pray an hour an hour seems like so long
[24:19] when we get down to pray but that's not
[24:22] uh in in brother brandom's time the the
[24:25] way that he thought of T get before the
[24:28] Lord that was not even you just barely
[24:30] getting started because are we willing
[24:34] to do whatever it takes whatever it
[24:36] takes to save the Lost whatever it takes
[24:38] to see our family save whatever it takes
[24:40] to see our church grow in Grace and and
[24:44] get stronger whatever it takes what do
[24:46] you have to drive somewhere to talk to
[24:48] somebody that uh is is struggling with
[24:51] the Lord or or just pick up the phone
[24:53] and dial her number and call them
[24:56] whatever it takes
[24:59] now if I can interrupt you know what
[25:01] I've allowed to be a stumbling block for
[25:03] me
[25:04] is you're not supposed to be
[25:06] repetitious so yes
[25:09] yeah I get a little confused I'm I
[25:12] appreciate what you're saying today but
[25:14] I allow that to be a stumbling block
[25:15] that you're not supposed to be
[25:16] repetitious When you pray say it and
[25:18] stand on it yeah right well what what I
[25:22] think when I pray uh is I I don't I know
[25:27] that brother said don't be repetitious
[25:29] but I I sometimes I am a little bit
[25:32] repetitious getting started and you know
[25:35] I think that's fine because once things
[25:37] get moving then I you know they they say
[25:41] uh that you kind of break through when
[25:44] you pray that you kind of start off when
[25:46] you kind of start off is kind of you're
[25:48] you're you're telling God what you
[25:49] believe and asking things asking for him
[25:52] to to uh give you things but then after
[25:56] a little bit it it's almost like it's
[25:58] not you anymore speaking that he begins
[26:01] to speak through you and so I
[26:06] um that's what I believe that you know
[26:09] just if it once you got once your knees
[26:13] are on the ground then you've already
[26:14] made a huge step because this day of
[26:17] time it's so hard even to put your knees
[26:18] on the ground it's so hard to set time
[26:20] aside it's so hard to uh and I know the
[26:23] Bible says pray unceasing pray all the
[26:25] time just wherever you wherever you're
[26:26] walking around you just speak to him and
[26:29] but I I I do think that that there comes
[26:33] a time when we need to set aside time
[26:35] maybe you're not calling out to God with
[26:37] all of your heart but you're setting
[26:39] aside quiet time so that he can speak to
[26:41] you and maybe a lot of times what I like
[26:44] to do is is I just I just get in a quiet
[26:48] time and and open the Bible and begin to
[26:50] read and before long something you know
[26:54] you just you reading in Isaiah or Psalm
[26:56] 91 and something Sparks and I believe
[26:59] this and then when you you begin to pray
[27:01] you can tell God what you believe and I
[27:03] believe he likes that when you tell him
[27:05] that I believe your word and and I know
[27:08] what this is talking about because you
[27:09] revealed it to me and that uh that just
[27:13] opens up the gates where you can you can
[27:15] begin to speak to him in confidence
[27:17] knowing that he hears and and will
[27:19] answer your
[27:21] prayer and and it's such a great comfort
[27:24] when you know you can you can get down
[27:26] on your knees and and and pray and and
[27:29] and just kind of talk but when he comes
[27:31] on the scene yes and vindicates that he
[27:34] has heard your prayer then you can get
[27:37] up and walk in faith and that's that's
[27:40] what that's getting into the third pool
[27:43] and and uh I uh let's uh we just got a
[27:49] few
[27:50] minutes let just we'll just end on this
[27:53] we'll we'll read I I'll read it to you
[27:55] you don't even have to turn in Matthew 6
[27:57] now this is what I was going to Matthew
[27:59] 6 1-6 take take he that you do knock
[28:02] your arms before men to be seen of them
[28:05] otherwise you have no reward of your
[28:06] father which is in heaven therefore when
[28:09] thou doest thine arms do not sound a
[28:12] trumpet before the as the Hypocrites do
[28:14] in the synagogues and in the streets
[28:15] that they may have Glory of men verily I
[28:17] say unto you they have their reward but
[28:20] when thou doest arms let not thy left
[28:22] hand know what thy right hand doth that
[28:25] thine arms may be in secret and th
[28:27] Father which seeth in secret himself
[28:29] shall reward thee openly and when thou
[28:31] prayest Thou shalt not be as the
[28:32] Hypocrites are for they love to pray
[28:34] standing in the synagogues and in the
[28:36] corners of the streets that they may be
[28:39] seing of men and verily I say unto you
[28:41] they have their reward but thou when
[28:43] thou prayest enter into thy closet
[28:47] alone just you and God and when thou H
[28:50] has shut thy door pray to thy father
[28:54] which is in secret and thy father which
[28:56] seeth in the secret shall reward thee
[29:00] openly and when you pray pray violently
[29:04] when you do anything for God do it
[29:06] violently do everything that you do do
[29:09] it with all that you got and we'll stop
[29:11] right there rocking out tears and
[29:14] I
