[Music] amen [Music] amen and amen you want to see him well then you can see him because he'll make a way that's what he's always doing that's the whole point and amen good to see everybody in the house of the lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn to revelations 3 that we've been reading from then from genesis 1 and genesis 2 try to continue the thought and bring the message more to a close in the basis of what we've been talking on the new creation new race we won't be ending it we'll just be changing over and picking up some things to uh to deal with that we we appreciate we had to really enjoyed the what's not service and all like that it was a great time i hope you enjoyed it because it was to me it was a good time it was a good ending up of the year and bringing forth the new and our brother done a marvelous job ministering the scriptures unto us and we thank him for that amen just remember pray one for another brother bob we'll be ministering this afternoon because we're going to start now today back on the two services so it'd be two o'clock brother bob will be ministering uh wade is having to deliver mail they've got so far behind until he's out on the

you're in that you you don't want to cover and don't want to be in it this next year then let us know because that'll that'll save us the trouble and then we can get all of that together and get everything set in order uh of making out the new officers because it's just a thing we have to do is assume that point amen father we thank you for the day and the hour that we have thank you for giving us a new time a new day a new year a new new opportunity to be able to serve you we pray that you would just bless lord each one remember the sick ones some among us here lord being this still old devil trying to do everything he can but just be with each one and just bless remember like brother longoria and them their lord and their church are having a lot of a lot of troubles and things with the virus so just be with each one have your way lord let your light shine to each heart and knife our lives and lord let our hearts and all be set on fire for you in this new time and new day because it is a new time it's a new race it's a new creation that we're facing things that mankind has never faced and lord we just pray that you to help us true guide us and keep us in jesus name amen revelations 3 14. we keep reading this because it's the message to this church age right okay and unto the angel of the church of the lady of siam's right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god all right now we come down to that and it's used speaking of the beginning of the creation when really it's the winding up of the creation or the finishing of the creation is into this age here but that's that's one of those things that we look at all right let's go to revelations 1 26 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them all right now we know that's a spiritual creation that is not a physical we'll get to that as we go through now we go to the physical part because the prophet said god took 116 the spiritual man put it in human flesh in genesis 2 7. and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathe into his nostrils or breath of life and he became a living soul you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now i i don't want a shortcut and do and drop off but i want to try to move up today because we spent some time talking about the calling it the new creation i look back and my notes and things and on the computer about four or five years ago i spoke on this uh new creation new race and uh you know it can never end because it constantly unfolds you know as we're going along and you know we uh we know that you you got to justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost and that brings you into the body of christ and making you a new creature a new creation all right now that's wonderful and all and that's what i've been driving hard to see for us to follow the line of seeing that god's first creation was himself not a creation he didn't create that's that's where we we uh take those words and we we destroy ourselves by thinking on those words instead of thinking in the right order god didn't create who created who uh mankind some believe see that god created jesus and jesus created everything else well that wouldn't that that wouldn't work out you're still you're hung in your trinitarianism i don't care if you claim it in the message of of believing one god you're hung in trinitarianism when you're still hung up with the the point of trying to explain it that way and it's not that way so we know that god never had a beginning like we talk of the word term using it of the beginning he always was eternal so then you can't say well now he created but it's just terminologies when the prophet said god's first creation was himself well it simply means to me now as a way the prophet explained it it's just god's way of explaining or manifesting or showing himself just like the bible says no man hasn't even seen the father except the son all right which is bringing him forth and manifesting him all right see then that's where it started in the beginning god he was trying to condescend down to mankind or down to life and bring mankind into being is a better way of saying it because this is all we know we spent quite a while studying about the the creation of god in that form was back before the foundation of the world all right and see the first creation then was god himself and then out of god came forth the logos the theophany the the words that we use to express the eternal god and as it did then god made man in his own image genesis wonder all right man and male and female he made them in his image all right then what is the image of god the well it's a glob it's a this is that no we've been over these over the years god is a being all right now you say well now uh but but brother dale we're we're not in the image of god this flesh man is not the man that's with inside of that is the man that you're talking about so then genesis 1 26 and 27 he made man in his own image whatever the image god was or likeness or whatever whatever he looked like you know then when he created man in genesis 1 26 he created a man in that image or in other words he brought forth that man in that image he didn't create because that's where we get our words and and terms i was thinking uh some i've tried to study back you know to where i can can speak more but the prophet said that adam was god's first creation in the mankind line all right he's bringing it forth and he he came forth adam was created all right now but jesus was begotten all right now watch you say well look that's the same thing no it's not you're a long ways off and you've missed your point because remember adam was created full grown right he wasn't created a baby but jesus was created a baby or come forth in that image all right so then we we try to make words to fit something to explain ourselves but it's it's humanly impossible but see god has tried to reveal himself that's the whole point to make himself manifest to where that he could reveal himself to his people and what was the purpose he was lonely he was lonely because he was by himself he was elohim self-existing all right he existed alone and it wasn't that jesus was with god back there see you're in your trinitarianism no it was the way he is coming forth all right he comes forth to reveal himself and what was his first creation than himself in other words he steps over enough to where mankind will be able to eventually comprehend what's taking place and as he does then he's showing himself of who he is see then he makes the man well then if you want to know what god looks like look at the man now not the physical because that's in the animal all right but the spiritual man is the spiritual god you know the spiritual god himself coming forth to manifest himself or unfold himself showing what he is and see that that way you know people don't understand me a lot of times i guess when i'm trying to speak and maybe i don't understand myself that's all right see i believe god is real now i know the bible says god is a spirit now i know the prophet what he's saying that god is not in bodily form right we know that he's not in bodily form he's in spirit form but what did he look like well i don't know you just don't know well he made demand he may demand his own image for whatever god whatever man is god is that being and whatever god is man is man he is god is he comes forth as being an understanding see to me i'm trying to get you to see god is real because i believe he's real brother brandon said he's not like the wind it just blows backwards and forth he said he's a being see he's the person the terminologies we use maybe foul up what our thought is but he's a person and he's real and see then we're going back to that image because that's where that's what i'm saying i'm trying to bring this point in to bring to a close but yet it's seeming so hard because we're just now getting started do you realize that the eternal god is trying to reveal himself to mankind and in doing that he had to use channels and ways and things because i i hope he was listening to the message i've tried to bring and and and listening to you know what i've been trying to stumble around and find words to talk about yeah because how can you talk about the eternal god and see then you'll get in your mind god is a spirit you can't see a spirit we can't see a spirit if he's don't if he don't take a form that's right i mean you can't see god if god don't take a form that he can come forth that the person can comprehend him the best you could say would be you could feel him maybe or something but you can't see him because god's not in that a realm that we live in in the natural like that but yet he's there and see he was there before the world ever begun you mean brother dale you think that god has a a a form about him right i've always believed that he's not just like the wind just popping around you know and he's just going and all that no he's real [Music] and the reason that i know that that what i'm talking about is the truth because we're going toward that image i hope you've been listening to the point i've been just easing up a little easing up a little and to come to find out the church is the last image of god upon the earth right so what does god look like it looks like a spiritual image of what it is now not the physical man but the spiritual man brother random would say what kind of a man did god create he said spirit man what he said because god's a spirit well now you're you're a whole lot more uh i hope you think about yourself as being real you know i mean uh we're not just a spirit that's floating around right we're a being amen and god is trying to bring forth into understanding where we can see it and comprehend that god was trying to reveal himself and as he did it would come from god to adam all right and adam then was not first created human flesh he was first created a spiritual being because god is a spiritual being no all right then in genesis 2 and 7 then he becomes a natural man a natural man a human man a flesh man looking like the animals in their image instead of in the image of god in that natural part but yet still when he comes forth you know you go from god to adam and bring adam in as a spiritual being first don't bring him in as a physical being bring him in is it supposed to be a spiritual being in the image of god all right see you're going then from god to adam in the spiritual image then you go from you've got to come in there with that creation of adam in natural i don't mean this wrong i mean this way if you that haven't heard the life's message i preached on this i would ask you to do me a favor you say you yeah because it would help you to understand i've listened four times i think it is to that service that's not bragging on me it's the fact that i would have loved to hear and then just sat there friday night and hearing our brother and he just come right down the line i was watching him very close and he came right out to a point that i haven't even got to and see i want to talk to him you know see how far he can go on and on i enjoyed it i thought he'd done a marvelous job but i'd ask you to get the last message that i tried to preach well let's go to any good time you got time to do everything else don't talk to me about stuff like that and jump you know i mean if you were in school and the teacher uh you know told you to read a certain book you ought to read that book and to me the greatest book of all to read right now and what i'm talking about is christ the mystery of god revealed if you get that message and go through it you'll see exactly what i'm talking about what i'm trying to bring it forward because there's something about the creation that i haven't touched yet am i just saying it that way i'll touch on it today let's see if you can follow it or try to so you go from god in the basis of god being the beginning and being there in the beginning and being the eternal god the self-existing one and then he starts condescending downward and as he does he becomes in to be known as the word logos theophany word anointed or anointing and even come down to the son of god that's what i've always told you that's the hardest thing seeming to get people to think about that the son of god was back before the foundation of the world but the son of god and a spiritual form god in another form called a son he's the word he is the word the son of god the word the word created all things is that true the bible said all things were created by him by who not jesus the flesh man he was not back there to do that jesus the spiritual man so you're coming from god to adam now adam's not physical now keep with me he's just in the image of god he's eternal because god is eternal that's what brother branham says blasphemous names now i'm not i'm sorry if you won't go read the book to see what the prophet has to say about it then all i got to say is to you you're the one that's losing not me because i've taught it over and over and over brother brennan blasphemy's name he said especially into adam he breathed the breath of eternal life see because adam was an eternal person with god now the spirit man adam not the flesh man the spirit man let us make man and he made a spirit man or in other words he just expanded himself he just stepped over into another form called the word and begin to create all right see then you look at that and you see that adam in this and eve in the spiritual condition what if there had been no fall what if it had been no fault but see there would have been no displaying of the attributes right so it's not messing it up it's coming out to the right order adam in the spiritual man could not fall brother random said adam and the natural man fail but we've got to cover that because that's hard to understand you can't make adam die and go to hell don't get into your line of thinking so when brother brown said adam died think about natural but you got to get the man here first see you've got to get the man adam here because there is no fallen condition with the spiritual man adam the spiritual man adam is in the image of god and lightness and cannot fall all right then if we believe the prophet in saying that god wanted to display his attributes he was a savior and there was nothing to be sick there was nothing to be lost so what did he do god had to make a way that the attributes could come into being what'd he do he made adam a flesh man genesis 2. he made him a flesh man and he put that genesis 1 26-27 man spirit man into flesh now he has a way to express his attributes because adam was a human being see adam had eternal life in his soul because that was the image of god put into adam genesis 1 put into genesis 2. all right now when he comes to that place then adam is standing there a flesh man god had to create adam that way to be able to make to where that he could bring his attributes into being see now he has the ability to do that because adam is a flesh man adam is a flesh man so adam and eve would come forth blasphemous names he would be eternal in soul adam and eve would be but not eternal in body because if he's eternal in body there wouldn't be no ability to fall there wouldn't be no no would do it now wait what i'm saying hey brother adam blasphemous names what did he fall the seal book around him said adam fell from eternal life to death in the garden where'd he fall to do you die and go to hell no well why can't you just think a little bit put on your thinking cap and spiritually think it over god is bringing forth a way that his plan of redemption can be made manifest well man had to fall to worry that there could be a redemption and he couldn't create a sinner so he created him perfect i didn't say eternal now he did in the spirit man but not the physical body huh adam's body was not eternal that's what i said about that scripture there in in corinthians if we have time to get to it you got the first man adam and the second man adam first man adam was a human being second man adam was the lord jesus christ do you realize then that god created adam into a human being before jesus the flesh man came into being did you catch that before the flesh man jesus could come into being it took four thousand years really six you know you know coming over into where we're at but 4 000 years to be able to bring forth the human body of the lord jesus christ so adam came first according to corinthians there which came first see adam came forth and god created him in the way that he would be subject not sinful but subject to sin because he'd be a human being the spiritual man couldn't fall huh so when brother branham gets into the seal book he said adam fell from eternal life to death but you're not listening to the rest of what he says he said you say then adam died he said but before adam died said he had a lamb now you can't make adam fall the way you think he fell because he didn't fall to eternal death he fell to natural death in other words he never never did reach eternal life in flesh he had eternal life in his soul in the image of god but he never did come to the that natural man never come to the position of eternal life even the natural man jesus christ didn't come into the world with eternal life in his flesh the key to the whole thing is where he come to where he was supposed to be see if you'll read corinthians 15 you'll remember one thing if you'll read it and read it and read it corinthians 15 read the whole chapter there paul is talking about the resurrection no resurrection no change in the body okay so listen see so in the natural create in other words in the creation it goes from god and his coming to forth of the word and thing and then he brings adam into being now he's got somebody that he can fellowship with and he's got a man remember that was put over the animals not the physical man adam the spiritual man is the one that was put over the animals to rule them and control them in things naturally the human element would come involved but yet it's still not there see jesus didn't come forth in flesh until 4 000 years later amen he said well i don't i don't understand what you what are you i'm talking about one simple thing first it's god coming down condescending bringing it over and when he does he brings man into being in a spiritual condition oh genesis 1 26-27 then that's not no way then god looking at it there's no way that he can do anything because man has not fallen so he can't display the attribute of savior healer etc he can't do that those are parts of his attributes of his being of his person brother brother said if you want to know what god looks like he said just look for what he's making manifest all right see so it's god coming down and bringing adam the spirit man into being then he puts that over into the flesh and when he does man falls he's standing there with eternal life in his soul but his body is not eternal don't think don't ever get it in your mind don't even consider the thoughts that you can say well i'm a christian i can't be lost i'm saved i can't be lost don't get that in your mind adam never died and went to hell no but yet he never reached eternal life in flesh there's never been but one man that ever reached eternal life in flesh and that's the lord jesus christ there's the key to the whole thing that i've been talking about there's the part of complete of uh creation that i haven't spoke of all right so we talked about three stages from god existing alone and then coming down now he exists with adam and eve because he was in adam that's what brother rome said now you can argue with him if you want to said he was in adam and theophany so that's right with me but you just do what you want to because you are anyway you're not going to listen you think you got it figured out but you see i'll go ahead and listen just see if you got it figured out you really realize the new creation you race hadn't started yet it's never been in but one man i'm just beginning to get started of understanding but trying to get you and me to understand what the the stages of creation that god condescended downwardly in his creation if you want to call it in his being and his coming forth he came down into where that he could be comprehended all right and when he did he brought a man into being adam spirit man in his own image right that still wasn't enough there's no way that adam in that condition could fall so he puts him in natural flesh come on right he puts him in natural flesh the natural flesh man can fall not to hell not to be lost eternally but can fall from the point of what's doing because adam never attained unto the position that god wanted him to do he failed in sin well i don't understand that no you're not wanting to understand if you want to understand just simply listen you come from god to adam everything's still perfect no sin no savior no nothing then you come from adam the spirit man to the natural man an atonement appears natural man fell from receiving attaining unto the position that he should have been had there been no fall adam would have walked right straight in and you and i would have been able to walk right straight in with him because remember one thing for certain the tree of life was in the garden right the tree of life was in the garden we deal with the tree of death with adam i mean with the with satan and the beast and the thing and we we don't get the point of seeing the tree of life we're standing there god had to make an atonement i know i preached funny and i preached a word that you've got to understand because i want it to be that away see because that way you have a hopes of being able to receive have you thought about what i'm saying that that when adam came into being now you have something that can fall but not be eternally lost why because before the end of atonement had already been made before adam sinned the atonement the lamb that's why they brought around and said did you say but brother branham said adam died he said before adam died he said he had a lamb where was that lamb before the foundation of the world amen that's what your bible says the lamb slain before the foundation of the world when was that lion slain before the world back there when he was existing alone because he was making a way come on church one split second in the presence of god without an atonement you're dead agree we'll see if adam and eve had ascend without the atonement already paid for them where would they be they would have been lost but the lamb was already slain you said that was in god's mind hey god's mind is a whole lot more real than me and you so don't don't go that away with me this day women listen see when the natural man came into being he came into being perfect god didn't create him wrong he didn't create eve wrong he created eve to be what she wound up being a mother right he didn't create her to be a male he created to be a female that's why this but you see then you get adam here from the spiritual condition then you get him here as a physical being and you can see the fall transpires and the fall when it comes into being then god can start coming on the scene but the flesh man jesus didn't come back there it was 4 000 years later when jesus come into flesh so you got it from god to adam spiritually speaking then you've got adam coming into being as a part of genesis 2 as to where he's the flesh man and he brings the ability for the fall to follow forth and you've got a long ways before you come to the new creation in your race you've got four thousand years of mankind upon earth and man stumbling trying to find his way to god and god trying his best to reveal himself to man but there's nobody in the old testament received eternal life nobody came like adam you see no nobody come like no that's right nobody didn't come back jesus but nobody come like adam because adam comes spirit man first which was eternal life in his soul the natural man comes second all right now so then from adam to jesus you have the natural man flesh man you have mankind in a fallen condition but just remember all the way through you still have the atonement the atonement was made before the foundation of the world so when mankind sinned it just brought a display of that attribute into being i'm home church i sitting there the other day cried i thought god can the people see what i'm talking about by approaching it the way i'm talking about it when you got adam coming into being as a spiritual man first then he comes into being as a physical man now you have the ability for god to display his attributes because adam sinned well you can't sin he was he had eternal he didn't have eternal life like you and i have eternal life now that one's going to take a while to explain you mean there's a difference yes adam never went through a new birth there's a difference in adam and a and jesus adam was created brother random said straight from the hand of almighty god and he was created a full-grown man but when jesus come it took four thousand years before that baby could come into being but when that baby would come into being he would be to be the only begotten adam was his first creation jesus was his only begotten the only one that was ever begotten that away the only one that ever come that away come on am i right eve conceived of the holy ghost not true man i mean mary conceived not through man jesus was virgin born adam wasn't virgin born adam was created right adam was created jesus was virgin born begotten of the father amen a body brought into being by god almighty himself see then you have adam to jesus you have natural man in a sinful condition when you come to jesus now you have the ability to talk about now i'm talking about jesus when he came into birth and came on up and now not he wasn't capable of dying for our sins when he was first born he you know you understand what i'm talking about he had to wait until the ministry was there the thing but yet when it did there stands a new creation nobody between adam and and jesus was virgin born amen a new creation god and man to meet together in a human element and be a new creation no longer dealing by ways of the natural creation he dealt with adam i'm quoting brother branham and adam fail he dealt with no moses and moses failed he met with abraham trying to do it on abraham failed see nobody's ever been able to do anything during that time between adam coming forth as a human being in flesh nobody down through there had a virgin birth right but then one day here come the one that could make a new creation and jesus was a new creation god and man met together in human flesh the birth of that flesh why was it not okay that david the great god loved david why couldn't he just let him have a baby and things and it'd be all right you know what i'm saying through a wife or whatever they couldn't do it there wouldn't be no new creation the old creation okay are you following me see then when jesus comes on earth the baby jesus there is a new creature and i said that the way i meant it there come a new creature god and man in human flesh a new creature not like all the rest of them not like the rest of mankind but a new creation there he stood on this earth there's a new creation there he went through his life in 30 years and a new creation yet he couldn't display it are you with me he couldn't display it because as it was in the garden there had to be a fall so he had to permit adam to come now when you see jesus standing on the earth he's a total new creation he's god in human flesh right the man christ jesus the second adam was god in human flesh god created a body to come down and live in that body would make the atonement but you put him as a human being and what was he standing there in a top now an example you had adam standing with eternal life in his soul but yet his body was not eternal so you have the same situation existing when jesus comes on the scene the soul was eternal but the body was not brother brown said it even at river jordan there that the body had to be redeemed the body of jesus not that it was sinful no but because it had a beginning and anything that has a beginning as an ending right adam's body had a beginning he'll have to have an ending it has to be made eternal are you following me but you see when it happens with mankind god and man becomes one by the new birth we're a new creature according to the bible a new creation distinct from the old creation now is there any difference in you and and and uh david no we look alike we act alike we live alike we eat a light we do i'm just saying david you know any man anybody you want to put it but in jesus christ was the ability just as it was in adam the ability to fall was god's plan i said ability to fall i didn't say made god didn't make adam fall but the ability to fall came into being now you've got one coming that can take away the fall jesus was a new creation a new creature he wouldn't know no of the old race he wasn't born from mary you know what i'm talking about he was born by the spoken word he was spoken into existence he was begotten not created jesus wasn't created he was begotten he came forth from the wound of a woman right but yet he had to do that to be able to be our brother amen our savior those attributes could not be displayed they were things back in the old testament like healings and and things and there was a salvation of the old testament yes but it was not a salvation of eternal life in the soul of mankind nobody none of us didn't even come like adam jesus is the only one that came in the correct way you see when jesus stood on this earth it was the beginning of a new creation huh no longer dealing like that like he was with adam and abraham and moses and all of them because they couldn't do it god and man met in jesus christ in a new creation but let me say it this way and then i'll get back to it eventually do you realize that being a new creation you raise the lord jesus standing on earth was god's plan and purpose god's desire had been made flesh because there stood our healer our savior our redeemer all the things sit on earth in a man called jesus he was a new creation totally different now maybe that will dawn on you if you'll just listen to a minute if he's a new creation and a new creation meant for him to come the way he came then do you realize the way you came he didn't have to come by a new birth to be a new creation but we have to have a new birth to be a new creation right we have to have a new birth we have to go through justification same case the baptism of the holy ghost the receiving of eternal life into our soul still we just reached a position that we have eternal life in our soul because we don't have eternal life in our body and our spirit there's things god has not displayed yet too one thing is he hasn't changed our bodies he said well how can that come it'll come because we all right listen so we have to have the new birth to be a new creature but even though we have the new birth it doesn't mean we have the virtues etc we don't have all of the things we have to grow into those things as children in a new creation but at least we can talk about a new creation but just remember one thing you're sitting here right now as a new creature in christ jesus by the new birth into your soul but your body is not redeemed it's paid for all right but it's not redeemed see jesus reached that position jesus became a new creature because there was never a creature like that before and he was the beginning of the creation of god god in human flesh yet he had to walk in that human flesh it was not eternal but in his death burial and resurrection he reached it that's why the bible says that no man hath approached to immortality except jesus christ immortality is eternal life in a human element there's never been a man with eternal life in a human element outside of the lord jesus christ and he had to give that life to be able to even just to make us new creatures sure we're a new creature but there's a lot more to go with it there's a lot more to that has to be covered in a new creation because see you and i are only adopted into we'll get to that but just stay with me for a second let me just read this because i tried to read it the last time and still didn't get it fully read let me go ahead brothers to number number 11 because it's the thing that we've been reading over and over to try to get you to understand and now listen the key is to listen very carefully to the wording of the prophet because in the wording he's laying down the plan of redemption but see justification cases of baptism in the holy ghost is not the full plan of redemption you got to have a body change there's a plan of redemption that's not covered it's a body change so listen to what he's saying now but now he's standing in the midst of the church it's about the lord jesus christ as he stands there revealing who he is in this life's age he calls himself the author of the creation of god that's the author means the creation you know that's the point of it trying to get you to see look now he calls himself the author of the creation of god this is another creation now if he's the author if he's the if he's the creator this is an another creation this is the church coming forth into the same creation that he is may i say it that way you think we're not going to have to do that we're going to have to come to the same way he came amen listen this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself so what is the church the church is the born-again believer that is a special designation of god so now you have by the new birth in you god in human flesh called a new creation no it's not finished no we've got a lot more to go but it's we can say that because listen this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of the church the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride as the spirit of god he came down now look i don't know how they done what they're putting in it but listen the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride stop now now the next part of the sentence is going over to well let's read it he is the creator of that church the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride all right as the spirit of god he came down and created in the virgin mary the cells from which his body was born now he's gone to the body right come on he's gone to the body now all right see then the body is going to have to be made a new creature the new birth makes your soul a new creation but something's got to happen to this body so look where he goes from has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself okay he is the creator of the church the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride amen stop his sentence and listen for a minute now now as the spirit of god he came down and created in the virgin mary the cells from which his body was born i want to repeat that he created the very cells in the wound of mary for that body it was not enough for the holy spirit to simply give life to a human over over he pronounced supplied by mary see that don't work we don't believe mary supplied no egg nothing no god created egg and sperm okay that would have been sinful mankind produced in the body that would not have produced the last adam if if he if mary had anything to do with the birth of jesus christ it would not have produced a second adam the second adam is the lord jesus christ the god of glory first adam is the god you know of the human elements and the things of back there listen that would not have produced the last adam of him it was said lower body thou hast thou father prepared for me god not mary provided the that body mary was the human incubator and she carried that holy child and brought him to birth it was a god man he was the son of god he was of the new creation now man and god met and joined he was the first of this new race he is the head of this new race he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminent are you listening are you thinking about what he's saying but let me just get this and i'll quit because i know i can't go we have to come you and i somebody has to come to a certain position i believe that i've always taught that i believe it i believe that it's involved in the basis of you and me reaching a position and that position is a new creature it starts from your soul makes your soul eternal then you start up the stature of a perfect man growing in grace and knowledge and those things see it's not finished there the word of god had to come forth in the last days to bring the ability to reach that position right is that what the prophet is that his words all right and see then what is it doing is to bring forth a new race of people you realize by the new birth that you're a new race let's get it right now hold it you're born again believer you are are of a new race you're not the old order made over if you are you're not born again that's what the prophet's saying he said it's not the old order see we've got to reach the position that adam was in the garden and adam in the garden was a human being with eternal life in his soul but yet his body he couldn't get to the tree of life well see in the end time the bride of christ has to come to the tree of life which is the word of god all right he comes down and designates himself by bap the baptism of the holy ghost just came because baptism of the holy ghost makes her part of this new race look what a race it would have been had adam had not fallen can you comprehend that i know that you say well that's impossible to be because it wasn't going to happen i know it but what if it had do you realize what it would have been had adam not fallen you realize it would be a wonderful world and even the worst that satan could do would not be able to take us down but what about a group of people coming to a position through jesus christ in the new birth a new creature until she's part of a new race you're part of a new race you're a new race of people you're a new order of people you have the greatest ability that could be thinking about you have eternal life in your soul and you have a right to the tree of life to take of that tree of life and live forever you can't live eternal as to pardon adam was saying that's why i said it would live forever all right you right now have the new birth that makes your soul part of that new creation but the one who made it possible for us to come to that place went on further than just the new birth his body was made eternal in the resurrection now he is a new creation a new race truly god and man living in a human vessel you realize that's what it's going to be for us to get out of here well we just can't do that brother well then we're not going to get out of here then so quit quick flummer around about it and think about it by the new birth we have the ability to be the part of the body of jesus christ we're waiting the redemption of our body to finish this new race do you realize what it's going to be brother ray if you get eternal life in your body then you're not an old race you're a new creature but you're what god wanted now he doesn't want us to stop without a change of the body getting the change in the body to go with this new creature people deal with it you talk about new creation huge creature and they'll say yes that new creature that's in jesus christ amen but somebody's going to go on to until this body is changed he said well i don't know whether i can make it or not with all right then just don't get in nobody's way is that the best way the prophet had to say did he make that statement he said don't let me if i can't do it don't let me hinder somebody that can i've preached over 40 years and over the 40 years i've preached from genesis to revelation new creation new race but i admit right now that i've seen more about that in the past year than i've seen in all my life just trying to bring it to you that you're a new creature but it's not finished this body is hindering us this body is in our way the statue of a perfect man is supposed to get involved want to try to take over this old flesh man and do it but see the bible says that jesus was the only one come on musician only one's to reach immortality eternal life in human flesh the lord jesus is the only person but see you and i'm gonna have to come that or we're not part of that new creation you race that he is i hope you listen to what i just said if we don't come to a change of the body we are not totally a new creation you race we're a new creature we're christian we're christian we're we have eternal life but when you talk about a new creation you race you're talking about god living in human flesh that has been made eternal you mean you think that these bodies are going well if they're not what are we going to do i mean we're going to just keep dying and just keep running and just keep going and just just going away and just you know up another the group oh we'll get it in this generation if we don't we'll get it in another generation um time's running out whether you like it or not it's running out on every one of us physically speaking it's running out but you see if we can come to that point the new birth brings you to the point of a new creation but the change of the body is going to bring you to a new race a race that god before the world saw in his mind of what he wanted and he's going to provide that he said well we just can't do it what okay just don't get in the way of the others who want to you know what i'm saying in other words don't try to down something i just don't see what brother they are talking about i can't understand this and i'm saying well i are you in lifting up or tearing it down which way because you're tearing it down you're in trouble with god not with me you're in trouble with god because you're doubting the way god is speaking i'm trying to tell you what the prophet said because every bit today you got the notes new creation new race a bunch of people with eternal life in body spirit and soul there is your new creation new race you say we can't make it well okay then we can't make it so let's eat drink and be merry cause tomorrow we may die and the way this old cobra guy is doing or how you pronounce all them things with his viruses he's doing pretty good but if we're a new race why don't we buckle down to something like that why don't we stand up and say buy stripes i'm healed by stripes i'm healed a new creation a new race what we've got brother let's stand sing that little course surely the presence of the lord is in this place surely the presence of the lord is in this place i can feel [Music] angel's [Music] there's a new creation you raise will be finished [Music] oh i can hear [Applause] surely the presence now remember what we're doing you know to you that stay here to eat usually whatever we're not trying to order this or do that we're trying to get everything figured out where we can operate all right and see then just remember what you're doing remember the closeness remember the mask remember the things and just while you're here and those that go out and get something to eat remember what you're doing you're just trying to do the best you can i like what ryan said he said me and my family will just go out to eat well i mean that's good you know he's got his mind in the right order so you know we do the best we can we're just trying to keep from being so crowded or congested for such a long period of time in the building anywhere downstairs upstairs or whatever because we're just trying to do our best as human beings you know just thank god for calvary father we thank you what we've said today lord we've tried but we know we failed so just help us it was all to try to get a thought in our mind that would be concerned a point where we're a new creation but we're not into that the way we want to be we're not a new creation the way we want to we're needing new creation in a new birth right lord we believe that but we have other things too we need more about you have your way in each one of our hearts and lives we love you thank you in jesus name amen you're dismissed oh what a mighty god we serve what a mighty god we serve angels bow before him heaven and earth adore him what a mighty god we
