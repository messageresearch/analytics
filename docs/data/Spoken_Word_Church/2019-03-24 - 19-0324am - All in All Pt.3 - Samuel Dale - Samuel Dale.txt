others and that's your loving grace be with each one of us we love you in Jesus name Amen let's go to Colossians 3 and we'll begin reading the verse 9 down through verse 11 by not one to another seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds if we put them off we don't need to be lying to nobody right cuz that's not part of us okay you see what he's saying and how put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him where there is neither Greek nor Jew circumcision uncircumcision by variance in theand bond or free but Christ is all and in all all right now let's go to Ephesians 4 we'll start reading in verse 4 there is one body on one spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling one Lord one faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all amen he's kind of southern in him in you all you may be seated Lord had his blessing - reading of the word I like Paul in that he's he just gets the point across all right then we we've been on this dope we're talking about God being hauled and all coming down through to speak on you know these points because I want you to see that and follow me in the way that I try to present what I'm over what I'm doing and my point is is to see how that we believe firmly in one true and living God all right and Jesus is his name that's just enough to solve the whole print thing but we believe in one true and living God we don't God had many manifestations all right you can say well is it necessary that we understand or say about one God and the truth of the Bible and you'd say well is it necessary that we go through and understand the one God because he knows who he is you've heard people say it like that well then why don't we just go Tarpon the Bible throw it away and just say what we want to say cuz he knows who he is did you listen to that see your point is well you'd say well do we need to know these things about the Bible because he knows who he is well my point is do we need to do anything right in the Bible if we're going that away cuz he knows who he is so what does it matter you know let's just eat drink and be merry because tomorrow we die but I don't I'm not in that way I'm one firm believer in one thing if God can keep his Bible straight and I believe he has all right we don't believe in any contradictions that's within it we believe in man in contradictory but there's no contradictions in the Word of God alright now I'm saying it this way I believe he can keep it straight now if he can't keep it straight well are you listening I believe God has if it's trading it's right but if he can't keep it straight we need to find us another guy I mean that's just flying language that's not throwing on nobody or no stones at nothing but just telling it like it is if he can't keep his words straight he's not God well we've had man to do this I don't care what man to do a lot it's whether or not it's revealed to you anyway so you have to believe it and see whether God has made known or reveal go see we read are called in in the Ephesians where he says there's one Lord one faith one baptism one God and Father of us all well that's not trinitarianism there's just one true and living God and God has manifested itself and that's what I'm trying to get you to follow a line of understanding the Godhead more than just quotes from brother Branham of a statement of this or that or the other is to get you to see back in your Bible and read your Bible instead of your Bible to see God all the way down through the same God the Jehovah the Old Testaments we call it he's Jesus of the new right because he's just the one true and living God all right he then being that God then we watched him as he unveils his self and brother branham does it in such a masterpiece of terminologies because you know he was 7th grade education but that we don't believe in and being ignorant but we don't believe in going over the other way we believe that God can speak to anyone Paul was a great very intelligent man you know the greatest of all intelligence of the time under Camejo and those that had the great understanding and it was fine and he had a great knowledge all right but yet he said I count everything that I've ever learned to be dung that I may win Christ in other words he said if I don't have Christ living within me all of my intelligences work nothing now so we don't lean over here to say well we can't understand neither do we go over this away say well we don't need to understand because we all we're so smart no we need a revelation from God because that's the only way you can ever be saved you're not saved just cause you join a church or a site of creed or or believe a code of rules or a a doctrinal issue you know or anything because you can do this no you're saved by grace through faith that not of works lest it be you know in vain it would totally be in vain to try to make anything out of works because once you get something working here and it's going the devil's gonna cut that off you start on something else so it won't do no good all right but trying to get the thought across to where we can follow it throughout the Bible okay now then we've been on the point of studying it for quite a little bit that the Prophet used the terminology is like this he said God came in three sons named son of man son of God son of David all right now that will cover the entire journey of the Bible and see we don't need something else to place within it we just need understanding or clarification to our understanding all right because the Bible says even the eternal Godhead can be understood by the things that we see I'm a human I'm a son you know a dad you know I'm a pastor of a church I'm a retired General Motors employee I'm all kind of titles but I only have one night and in doing that then I don't have to worry about confusing something you say ah Jesus Jesus was Almighty God in human flesh or else he lied he was either that or he lied and that's my point if we can't keep things straight to know God and to understand God then we needed this throw away everything we got because we can't go to the intellect to try to figure it out but neither that we need to go to stupidity to try to pass at all we need to believe what God says in his word all right he said I'm God not saying he's not all right jesus said I come in my father's name well those things are simple if we listen to it i'ma deal why because my daddy was a Dale and it's simple you know if he'd have been a Jones I'd have better Jones that's you know it's no problem all right you see he said I come in my father's name well isn't it his father's name had to be Jesus because that's the only name God ever had then think about what we're saying he came in three sons named son of man would cover the entire Old Testament the prophets and they're speaking and then he would have to come up on earth and in Matthew Mark Luke and John is I've tried to cover he would have to come and and make yourself known so he never declared himself openly publicly to mankind as the Son of God because he was not manifesting that at the time he declared himself as son of man or huh and see he had to give his life release that that was within him which was the Spirit of Almighty God the very soul spirit being of God dwelling because the Bible said in him dwelleth all news of the Godhead bodily all right so then when he released that he was able to come back on the church on the day of Pentecost and could be made manifest as the holy spirit coming in to the people and given his own life all right so now there's where you changed dispensations or thoughts or whatever you want to call it but keeps the same person the same person that was living on earth in a human flesh that we call Jesus in a few days was living in a group of people called the bride of Jesus Christ same God not a different one oh yeah but you just don't understand brother Dale that we understand all this like I said we either take what God says or we forget it because there's no need of playing with things is to say in the right order and keep it all right we'll see down through the age we call the churchy ages or time from Pentecost to where we are now it's been son of God okay now he's in the next stage if we take a trip to had been as we went through would be the millennial reign which is to the Jews and that son of David which was promised to David that his son would sit on his strong will his natural son is Solomon with that wouldn't the promise that was the promise that Jesus Christ would sit on the throne in the millennial reign all right and that would be to her that we could see my son of man son of God son of David all right now in between there we saw the the mystery part of get this and we'll move on to the difference we saw the part that something has to happen because how can you go from son of god the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is to the Gentiles nations with Gentiles means nations I don't mean it Jew can't be saved but you can be saved in this dispensation anybody can be saved in this dispensation that accepts Jesus Christ because that's why it's called a Gentile it means nations all over are see then nations can come forth and receive but then when he turns back to the Jews that's an entirely new group of people so you're going from the Son of God the Son of David let's see that won't work so we went through brought all the things down to where we could understand that God just in the last part he kept promising it in the days when the son of man he said would be revealed he said who the man say i the son of man now I said you're the Christ the Son of the Living God he said flesh and blood didn't reveal that under thee my father said I'll build my church on that uh-huh one who he was he said one day I'll come back when we believe in a restoration we believe in jaw that I will restore all things you see there stood on earth guarding human flesh he said what do you expect in the last days brother Dale I expect God to be living in human flesh not one person no no not one person in the body of Jesus Christ be the bride the church is you would call it in some of your terminologies the Bride of Christ would be actually become to that then it could take a change of these bodies we're gonna have to have something cause this to me change but if not we just keep on dying well so then to fulfill the scripture see we line up son of God I mean son of man son of God come back just a little bit in the end time a son of man and then some go to son of David like I say it I wrote this work they can say you say do we need to understand this point well we don't need to understand the Bible then let's throw it away right I mean we don't need to understand it let's throw it away it's not a good book to live by you know what I'm talking about this book's hard to live by right they couldn't do it no Testament and we sure can't do it now so we don't go buy something we can do or live by we go buy what he can do or what he can make us alright see then is it important to understand is it important to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ or why not go back to the Catholic Church to take a father-son ole to go because that's where it comes from well 325 a day you started picking it up 606 you started all of those times back there and then you started changing things I can show you according to your own dictionary where it says the Catholic Church changed it and made it Father Son and Holy Ghost coat I mean what Jesus say it he said baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost that's not three names that's Lord Jesus Christ father son holy go Lord Jesus Christ alright so we're getting the point now to get it is it important to understand well why is it in the Bible if it's not important to understand yeah well you don't think we can understand everything now but we can understand what we can we don't have no right to deny any of it that's true so we follow it so then you got three sons named son of man son of God son of David everything that God reveals to mankind is made known through those three titles or thoughts everything is in that taking you all the way because Darwin Almighty God and they said come through the Old Testament showed himself through the prophets in the things that was taking place then he comes into human flesh and then he gives that life to where that life can come back into even me or through the church under there Pentecost and as it did then he's living in us Paul said Christ in you the hope of glory he said the life that I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God like I said a moment ago he was blunt he was a smart very highly educated man but he said I come that to be dumb you know that I may win Christ I may have Christ living within me he said cuz that's what I want is Christ to be made known that should be the goal or thought of any Christian doesn't matter who you are a child or you know children or what if you only claim to be a Christian will be trying to live like one I live like the devil claim to be Christians because that's not the point all right but now we came down to the point of what that he was he is to return in the last days from according to Malachi 4 according to Luke 1730 and the day when the Son of Man would be revealed God coming back to live upon this earth the way he started out the way he wanted to come back as the full word a full restoration would come and it would bring forth and ensure that the hour that we're living would come up to be to where this endtime message was sent to show Thessalonians he that the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout voice of an archangel in the trumpet the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain will be changed the whole thing is in the Bible under one of those terms son of man son of God son of David see then we we tried to pick it up into a higher form of understanding to where we can see the day that we're living we're in a period of time that we're fixing to change dispensation because God is going to leave the the Gentile dispensation very shortly that ain't no time elements I said that fifty years ago I'm talking like that I'm just saying it that he will change dispensations one day and he'll turn back to the Jews according to the Bible because that's what the word says alright he'll turn back to them once he turns back to them the then the Gentiles will be over with we'll see finding ourselves in the word to see what's taking place seeing the hour that we're living and seeing how that God wants to live in his people we read there in the scripture that God may be all and at all now that doesn't mean everybody in the world see now well you got your Bible that's where people don't understand they don't think in other words I can tell you the Bible says everybody's gonna be saved was that out of it they said that God may be all and in all well you mean it no that's not what it's saying it's not saying that everybody in the world will be saved you know what I just read it yeah but you read it from your human terminologies or thoughts that you just read words off a page the all of God will be saved yes all who are his children all who are who accept Jesus Christ as our Savior truly do now not make believe or truly accept Jesus Christ as our Savior then that's the all of God all of them will be saved but not everybody in the world that's what it's saying your point I'm trying to get you to look at well I'm telling you what the Bible says the Bible says always going to be saved no but your human terminologies of your mind order you would have plain sense enough to know that ain't right what are you doing that away what's any purpose of any time it's not saying what we think it is see just like I was saying our moment ago see the Bible Jesus said baptize in the name of the Father another son you know the Holy Ghost you say where'd he say he said in the scriptures in my name or in the name singular a father son don't go what is the name singular father Lord Jesus was son Christ is the Anointed One to come and live in us so why do you how do we about - in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you know but you're not doing what the Bible said yes I am but the world system is not taking what the Bible says they're taking how they read that like a man said it worked one day said and I'm not against Catholic I just use words alright and he said you're saying that the Catholics baptize wrong I says well according to the Bible it's all I'm saying and he said how many Catholics are thee in the world I said I don't know millions of millions of millions you know you know he said you mean they're all wrong and you're right I said no they're all wrong the Bible's right I ain't gonna do whether I'm right or wrong ain't tell my dad I'm talking about what the Bible says well it says father son Holy Ghost that's true Lord Jesus Christ his father son odigo our law I don't have no money in the bank but got a little bit anybody needs a couple hundred dollars I'll write you a check to give it to you you know for little money you say what you're getting that cuz it ain't gonna be no good if I don't put a name on it I can put titles pastor I can put this I can put Jim employee I can put all kind of titles but if I don't sign that name that cheque ain't gonna be no good well that's the way the Bible is if we don't take what the Bible says then we don't have to worry about the rest of it they don't even be in concern if we're not gonna believe it as being God's Word in other words my point is if I don't believe enough to know that God that created the world and I believe he did you know right I believe he created the world I believe he brought everything into being if he's not able to keep his word straight then we need to go out in the universe somewhere and find us another God yeah you're just silly no you're the Hornet silly I'm just telling it like it is we need to find another God if he can't keep his word but see he's always kept it it's always been true so we follow what he says all right see then the Bible is not revealing many gods because he we take that no no I come from the Baptist I'm not throwing those stones but we taught that he was was co-equal and coeternal God in three persons when that how can he be Co eternal if it's Father Son Holy Ghost one of them supposed to be older in the other one one supposed to create the other two or something some idea well see my point of what I'm getting at is either we believe the Bible or we don't believe it and then we follow it and the Prophet didn't come to teach us something contrary to the Bible he come to dis shorts what the Bible was plainly saying because that's what Paul was doing but shows what it was saying all right so now he comes in three sons named he coming son of man all the way down through the Old Testament then through the the gospel writings of Matthew Mark Luke and John the life of Christ then he wasn't seen this son of man down through the church ages he was seen as son of God which is all the spirit the new birth coming into the heart of mankind but to come back in the end time just for a little bit the Prophet said in between we gave you these quote in between the son of God and the son of David he comes back for a little while as son of man because that would come back to give us hopes of a change of these bodies and things that we could have a hope in this day because it would be a restoration back to the original God that walked on the shores of Galilee all right not brother branham see we don't believe in that we're not that that goes so far until it ain't even worth talking about so I said y'all believe brother Branham was God no I told him a fair man was standing in jeffersonville one day and he said we're talking about brother Branham being gone I said you know it is and I said listen I said I'll believe I'll talk to you about deity if you'll talk to me about he was trying to say brother Ryan was deity nothing I said if you'll go with me I'll go you go don't ask you one question any born-again believer has deity living inside of them which is Christ I said you agree they said yeah I said all right now if you'll tell me now pointed over I said you you tell me that brother there has the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he's just as much deities brother Branham was then I go along with you he said no way I said goodbye because I didn't have no more time to be fooling around see he was saying brother Brandon was dead we don't believe in that no there's only one true and living God if you try to make deities out of it you're breaking the scriptures and everything else you know but we believe God's Word is to be fulfilled in our day alright cuz see then when you change dispensations here in the last days which is I say the moment ago nobody knows when we're not talking about that but there will be a town come that God will go back to the Jews to fulfill the scripture alright and the brain goes people out of the Jews back into the lineage lineup and as he does the he'll be revealing himself to them the same way he reveals himself to me and you cuz he'll go through two prophets they called out 244,000 right those two prophets name that will be the Son of man standing on earth in his life's two witnesses that he brings on earth and he'll bring that word and they'll see Christ and they then must accept that Christ as they see it sort of go from son of man son of God and then those two witnesses will tell them after they've received the word and and the things for their day to give them life all right those two prophets will explain something amazing to those Jews that they wouldn't have today for nothing in the world they ki if you try to talk to them about it but to tell them that they missed the point of children of God they turn when they turn Jesus Christ down see they miss that when he goes to those Jews all this has got to be explained to them and they'll realize that a Gentile group of people come in and fill the kingdom see then they pull apart weep and everything else according to fulfilling the Scriptures because they are they become then the people of God which will be eunuchs to the brow you know the whole story alright and see then it'll be told and said you miss that you miss that son of man that that Gentile dispensation took and believed it the God could speak to mankind and not just speak to him by prophet but yet he could come in and make that people of prophetic people what a prophetic people well why not we're the children of God why don't you believe if you being a child of God you you have eternal life living in you right by the new birth you've accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior right and by having Christ living in you then why don't you accept the fact of what he's made you don't explain what that God may be all in all bringing it in this day to an understanding that what we see the future look how marvelous it is like I said you think it ain't gonna be a shock to those Jews when they realize one day that they crucified their Messiah the Bible says they'll pull apart and why cry for days well cuz they realized they realized not only did they reject Jesus Christ they rejected him as being Almighty God turned him down and that they've been under judgment ever since then which they called out on herself gonna remember and they chose that it's blood be on us well it's been on the Jews ever since you see those Jews one day we'll see what's taking place and when they do then they'll have a change of the body then they'll have a resurrection because they're all gonna be killed according to the book of Revelation the Beast is gonna kill all of them all right and when it does then they're going to raise up the same redemption we get we all wind up in the Millennium together that's what I love about it I love the way the Prophet said it whatever puts the Jews in the Millennium I'll put you in I in the Millennium well what puts the Jews in the Millennium accepting Jesus Christ and no one had realized that the point that they've lost or turned down and accepting him to be their Savior and Redeemer and see that he's already brought the bride through and took her in so then we're not going to the sees to us it doesn't matter in the Millennium he'll be sitting on the throne of David we'll be sitting around him but we don't have to have anything to do with that part we're an hour on the honeymoon that's the best way to say it that's as good a thought as anybody could get out of it the bride's got her the time though are the chickens through the Millennium ring and she walking the garden of God and like I told you you got a job to do we're supposed to be living examples of Christianity right that others may see Christ living in us you realize when we're in that millennial reign will be able to explain to those Jews on all of those things minute you realize according to the scripture they tell be a millennium temple to be built in the millennium and being there in the millennium in that temple see not a temple doll for sacrifices of that no but it be the temple setting there that you can explain to them Jews what they missed see there's not gonna be no temple in the future home because the Lord and the lamb are the temple there ain't gonna be no not ain't go no no day inside the city goes the lamb is the light you think it's hard understand let me say it to you this way you realize one of these days is gonna be no need of the moon the Stars the Sun in the future home there'll be no need of that well because the lamb the Bible said is the light well how can one man be enough to light the world you get in a dark room and strike a match right you know don't matter how dark it is I mean you'll be 500 feet underground George one time with my denim McMinnville up then went on all that stuff two or three slept about through 22.2 and 300 feet on the ground you know what we're really happy to keep flights like then you had an extra one just in case that didn't work because once you got in there so far they wouldn't know turnaround coming by and you certainly didn't want to turn off on one of the side roads they cautioned you that they don't turn right or left said just go straight as much as you can and sometimes he'd walk up against the wall and you'd be standing there like this and a big old wall and you look up and you look around with your flashlight and there's nowhere to go you look down at the floor make a little place about this big about like to help you got to go through that hole well I I didn't have quite as much they got now but I made it through but my point of what you say in that little light you realize they won't need be no need of a lot in that city because everywhere he's at will be daylight there won't be no moon when we don't stars they don't Sun in the future hope and the Millennium there will be because it'll how dates and times and seasons things into millennium but in the future home you won't have it it's what I said you think it's hard to understand a lot of you can you understand can you fathom one person stand in a world system could light it every bit up my god can whether yours can make it or not mine can you know what he put that in me so everywhere I go that God may be all and in all and so it's trying to end up there the other day on the message trying to understand all in all do you realize if that scripture is correct then God is living in you well we said he's the light of the world the scripture says you're the light of the world come on read your Bible scripture says you the light of the world the scripture said in him there's no darkness well if there's no darkness then everywhere he goes his light whatever where you go is locked and not lightning verbs you know flashing because they ain't gonna be turning the fire on and off you know see we we try to say well we don't understand a lot of the Bible it's plain if we just believe it in him there's no darkness well if there's no darkness everywhere he's that would have to be light that's sensible won't be no light bugs and Georgia power trying to run the whole thing it just means the Bible fulfilled but it says there in revelation 22 you have no need of the of the Sun you have no need of those things well cause he's the light well if he's the light then if he's living in you what does that make you do you realize that the only way you can see Jesus Christ is by looking at someone else that's making that manifest are you with me yeah but I just believe this I believe that know somebody helps you or directed you led you open the world unto you talk to you about Jesus Christ preached to you mama holding you rocking you telling you about it just think about Moses his mother now God worked out all out right they needed a nurse a wet mother he would call it because they didn't have bottles and stuff like that you know so they got a wet mother take care of it well who was the wet mother to took care of Moses Moses little sister said I know a wet mother where I can go get her I know somebody that can let that child nurse and raise it one over there got Moses no mother God worked the whole thing out who's surprised of the Egyptians he put him right in to her that he could come out to be ruler and just think about her sitting there every day rocking him you're not the son of Pharaoh's daughter he never raised up thinking about he belong to Pharaoh I we see the movies but remember movies ain't according to the Bible there according to selling Pete to people to get them to come to the movie you know I mean you see these movies you think about a third over his ride maybe the country they're putting it in about the only thing it's any good right here she sit there all day you know you're not the son of Pharaoh's daughter you're an Israelite and one day you're going to be ruler little all his life raised up listening to that she opened the light of the word to him and he just stood on it when he got through the time and he needed to give her brother Dale I saw the movie and that's what I mean not the best thing I've the ten commandments that you can get anything out of it is worth of writing on the Ten Commandments and turned out and it burnt out and put the commandments out all the rest of it is somebody's idea what this was or that was no like I've always said you tell me how come Pharaoh when Moses come back after they'd run run him out and he comes back up why didn't that King this they cut his throat he's afraid of him because he knew who he was he's afraid he's caused insurrection rose up against him take over why didn't the king that's that cut his throat see God had so placed it until they had to agree with everything all right listen to what I'm saying truth in the all and all all in all with one little part of the scripture that Jesus said that that day you'll know that I'm in the father you and me 9 you like I've always preached to you it's easy to understand what Jesus is saying when he's saying I knew right because by the new birth he comes with inside of it but explain the other where he says and you and me that's what he said he said I knew you and me so that that day you'll understand the day of this revelation you'll understand this I and you and you and me I didn't even good sense oh you're strong talking about the Bible it ain't talked about the Bible that way the Bible's right the only way you'll ever understand the Bible is to some way find out who you are and what you're doing here then you begin to understand see when Jesus said I knew that was easy that's the new birth that comes and lives in us as making us the children of God but what about you and me how could we be part of God oh that's what it's saying I and you we understand that right but you and me we went back there with him when he was shores of Galilee we wasn't there with him when he was in life but when you think about he could be all and in all all and in all I explained that a minute ago it's not everybody gonna be safe all and in all that is saved because all that's saved are part of God he said wait just a minute now well do you how listen now do you have the new birth a simple language I said the other day you know you had going this way or that way it's gonna tell which way you are so if you have eternal life if you have the new birth whatever you want to call it new birth salvation born to get experience whatever your terminology is you want to use do you have the new birth well then you got Christ living in you so Jesus was right I'm gonna come and live in you and said when I put my life in you you're gonna be me made manifest is that not what the children of God are are we not his offspring is that not what Paul was doing on Mars hey up when you got up there talking to him and they had a little inscription there said to the unknown God go ahead all kind of idols and things set up you know within in case they missed somebody they just made one little space and said just in case we missed some God somewhere because that was their idea they studied the gods that's just in case did will put one right here Paul said now listen he said I want you to know that's the God I won't talk to you about he said I want to talk to you about the God that's living in me oh it's easy to talk about the God that walked ashore to Galilee and the God of this and the universe and a different thing but what about when you talk about the goddess living in you well I just don't understand I don't understand alright I'll talk we you own that if you'll just explain to me what I said while ago how can God Himself stand in the future home and it needs no light because he is the light you'll explain that to me we want no problem with the other because all you got to do is take that light and put it in another vessel right we sang that song this little light of mine I want to let it shine because you're the light of the world the only way people can see Jesus Christ and see him in you right well I read it the book well who wrote the book come on don't be that way with me you said well I I didn't hear nobody tell about it I read about well you read what somebody wrote you can't come to God without somebody helping you see that God may be all in all now we're coming to the point of what I'm trying to say what that that day you'll understand ain't you that's easier to understand he gave his life he comes lives in us and you and me now how can that be understood about you and me you can understand it by the life of God coming and living in you by the new birth then Paul said it's not all that liveth the Christ that liveth in me see that way you can see they all and they in all God is in all of those that are born again you can't be born again without God coming and living in you you're not a Christian because you join a church go to creator believe a doctor or an idea come on up we're in this people we call them in time message you know yourself the biggest portion of them think they're saved because they believe what the prophets said then you try to explain to them what the prophets said and they go haywire they think they're saved just because they believe the Prophet well I believe the Prophet every with this quote the scripture - why is it now they're on the internet trying to arrest to destroy this message the people they used to preach this message were they talking about I and you and you and me I want to know how we can be a part of God that's simple to me you just get born again and when you get born again you take the life of Christ that puts God in you so I knew and you and me I made a way he's saying for you to become my children and said I've come now to live in you that it may be all and in all you know all that are born again I go saying there the other day about it you know we think about the devil being smart you ain't a smart you had one man to face when Jesus was in the world and he left him alone and went off and let him go he'd have never had but one to face but he's done what he thought was right what he could news sure how good he got everything together and tried to get him killed by getting him killed he wound up with a hundred and twenty little Christ the first whack then he had three thousand the next he'd have been better off he hadn't touched nobody and to touch the Lord Jesus but he couldn't do that but he was a destroyer he was trying to destroy them the channel what's that he made way you see that's where we try to blind this blind that we try to blame the crucifixion of Jesus on the Jews no it was my sin that put him on the cross it wouldn't do that put him on the cross is my sins you realize that he would have died if had just been one person that would have accepted him he would have died for that one person as well as he would for the millions that he did die for because that's our loving Savior he made a way to come and live you know he started out back there in Genesis trying to contact man and live with him the man just kept pulling away pulling away going after his own idea it went so far away until they finally crucified the very God of glory they stood on this earth would you realize too that if that hadn't happened you wouldn't be a Christian today it wouldn't be a Christian today without the blood of Jesus Christ that's why wouldn't you know Gentile he was Almighty God he's DN DNA wouldn't match nobody in the world cuz he was Almighty God either that or the biggest liar there is as you know we believe in it by believing in it do you realize that he's in all he's in all those down the time that has accepted him as their Savior he lived in mankind all the way through that's what he's wanted to do now live in you and me that we could show the world him living is that the purpose of a Christian you realize that he died in our place you realized that all he wants us to do is to die you remember the Jim Jones outfit down there you know were there all those people died because of his philosophy the man at work asked his brother said the sound arsonist he ever try to get you to kill yourself he said every time he preaches he's beating only trying his best to kill me because if he can kill me I can be made alive in Christ because that should be our gold all the way through that God may be all do you understand the Scriptures know that God may be all and he's in all he's an all born-again believers all of them are his children his offspring and has given us an opportunity to be a part of that be a part of that Kingdom and it'll wind up one of these days we finished all here in this world then we'll see what the all in all really means because that's word with me you realize when we get there that will be the all of God we may not understand a lot of things but when we get dark we'll understand but it looked like we ought to be able to understand a little bit here if we're his children come on I've told you how I am on life's and I'm in lines and things it wouldn't matter to me if I found out that I wasn't born the day oh then my real name was Jones or something else and I could get millions of dollars by going accepting the fact of being a Jones you don't believe me you don't believe what I'm fixing to say but if I offered millions of dollars it's changed my name to a Jones and they you know deny my family I've died pauper because I go sell out my birthright my daddy and mama raised me dad died when I was about four mom raised me the baby of 13 she raised me you think I did not that it changed my name to Jones just because of a few million dollars I could get in my pocket you say you're stupid no I'm crazy I'm just crazy enough to you better believe it I'll do it cause money don't mean that nothing we got to have it to live but it don't mean a thing to me sold my house you've heard me tell the story sold it to my nephew my brother come along and offered me $5,000 profit to sell it to him he said you ain't sold it to him yet I said no but he's got my word I thought told him he could have it I don't care what you offer it will never take it away from cuz he's done done about it it was just stupid not be that's just where I am so that's the way I unknown Christianity either the Bible's rider is not either it's the Word of God or it's not the Word of God either it's true where it's not true and it has all the answers it's like I was talking about how can all be at all he's not in all the world he's in all born-again believers simple answer by being in a born-again believer then the simple scripts right Jesus said I in you and you and me if we just realized the opportunity as we have Christians that we have in this world brother Dan would you go run for president of the United States that'd be the biggest shame that could be thought of to ask me to lose leave the job I am to try to explain Jesus Christ to you and go the president of a whole world know we'll put budget but you could be president and you could take over that's Moses now you get the story Moses thought he could handle it right when they raised up what Moses dude he's killed in the gypsum what did he have when he got through a stinking dead Egyptian he didn't have no control of nothing he was thrown out of the country does he try to self what I love about it the Bible says that Moses saw the suffering of Christ and desired to stay with that he could have been the head of Egypt come on he could have took over but he saw Christ you said how did he see it because his mom kept telling him you're not the son of Pharaoh's daughter you're the deliverer to come to the children of Israel to one day take us out of here right she told him all about it and one day he realized that he tried to deliver but he found out mom was experience wasn't enough he needed something else your mom and dad being a Christian that's wonderful great opportunity to be able to live up in a family like that but remember they don't save you all of Moses life he heard he was a deliverer but all he got was a stinking dead of the Egyptian I'm not throwing up on an Egyptian that's making it plain he got one person who went out when he got out the burning bush he said who are you bush was burning wouldn't burn up he said who are you he said I'm the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob Moses learned more in five minutes and from the burning bush then he had all of his life in his mother's arms next thing you see him he's headed to Egypt to take over right knew for certain - he was facing death I mean that's what would you think if you got hurt done been run off one time and see if you come back you hit it just get the point he suffered Christ he saw that he saw that he was the deliverer but that he couldn't do it of his own he said now you tell me - the burning bush said you tell me who's gonna lead him out he said I am that I am he went to Egypt and delivered Israel from that statement because he things had changed he realized there was a he believed there was a God from his mother's testimony he believed in a God of Israel he could read the Huayra what you call those things the hieroglyphics or whatever they the writings of all of those people he could read all of those things and it would tell all about what had taken place because he kept records all the way through but that wouldn't enough the five minutes in front of a burning bush he's got his wife on a donkey in Hidden Egypt take over because he saw what his mama had told him in reality now listen to what I'm saying he believed from mama behind you Moses you're the guy to take him in his eye on you God's done done this that and the other but when he got to the burning bush that one in the burning bush spoke and said I'm sending you and remember the way God does it if he sends you then he goes in you right see that's why there's no fear when you go to these foreign countries and if you know God is with you I've told you about burn in Jamaica when that guy came in the door o straggly time stood and looked around walk out in the building went to the back come in the door walk down into congregation turn and walk back out come back around to the first dougherty to come in walk right in the congregation I'll sit down Lord yeah I sure do hope you with me those you know I believe you told me to come so I'm just gonna have to believe with you you know how would you believe cuz you're saying something could take over he turned and walked out the door he went down the street barking like a dog all kind of thing I turned to the people I said either the servo I said where that man come from they said what man you weren't asking I said the man it walked in that door and come in here went out come brother walk down the house - through the church walk back out come back walk in the door again they said we didn't see nobody we didn't see no man I said well I ain't one just messed up my mind I ain't gonna worry about it I'm just gonna believe it say somebody took care of me because Hatton I would have been in trouble colonias vicious think about it that God may be all in all ever born again Christian is a little Christ right that's what the word missing it means we're little children of God we're his offspring we're his children come on children that's why you need Jesus Christ as your Savior then you don't have to worry about all these other things you need you mean you because he'll take care of you let's see it finally it's gonna have to come we gotta understand something like I said I'm gonna say it again now when Jesus said I in you said in the last days you'll understand it that I am in you that's easy to understand because the new birth puts him inside of us but then when he said and you in me you realize what you have inside of you is a very part of Almighty God it's a very child of God it's a it's a part of God Himself living in you manifesting himself to the world that's time when we go out with you do you know that God thattaway [Music] Wow you have a need just come [Music] [Applause] [Music]
