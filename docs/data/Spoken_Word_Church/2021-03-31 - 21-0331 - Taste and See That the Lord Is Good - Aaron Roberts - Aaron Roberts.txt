place for us he said that where i am you may be also so it fills us with joy every day to realize that we have a place beyond this round somewhere beyond the grave there is a land that jesus went to

skies some call it heaven [Music] amen hey man let's all stand this evening we're going to look into the scripture not we'll look into psalms chapter 34 and before we uh we'll go with the scripture not brother louise is preaching for brother martin and i don't know what brother martin's last name is to you brother martin from varela in little and uh lawrenceville said brother louise he sent us a message earlier told us and he would be down there so we won't remember brother luis and brother martin and the church down there and before we go to the scripture i got a as a the family that uh richard and i went to school with this uh family some of the kids and one of the daughters is named sunshine and she graduated with richard and um she graduated early in school she's my age but she graduated richard but sunshine's got a little boy named nahum and i just want to remember this family sunshine's husband has brain cancer and then a week or so ago again exactly when she had a miscarriage the day after that nahum had a tree limb fall on him and he's in the hospital right now he has shearing of the brain and they can't do a lot of testing on him because every time they try to do a lot of testing on him he becomes unstable and so y'all just remember them and uh i got brother brown always told us we need to enter in for people and so just remember them and as a brother from nepal he's i i got into he got in touch with me through facebook and he's i don't know how many times he's texted me and tried to call me through facebook messenger and everything but i put him on youtube of our church and man i don't know how many times i've gotten he just continually calls texts and everything but he's all excited but uh i put him on the on the youtube channel next thing you know he's texting me back said who is wade dale was explaining because you know on youtube they don't tell you everything it's not like the church website but anyway he was all excited about brother brother wade's sermon the other wednesday night so uh there's two sisters down there one of them has had a stroke and the other one has cancer and she's facing operations and he said he asked for us to pray so you all just remember those two sisters and and then a friend of mine it was a former co-worker he named daryl he passed away several years ago and uh still really close to his family his family means a lot to me and his daughter summer just went through her second back surgery she's only like 22 or 23 so she has a lot of a lot of issues but you know what god's still greater than all our problems any problem that we face anybody faces god's bigger than any mountain that we can or cannot see as the song says so you know i look sometimes i put people in my in my bible i write little notes and i've stuck nope pads and little post-it notes in my bible and you know i look back and i see people's names that you know i god you know the they put them god put some on your heart and it doesn't make anything out of me but all glory goes to him but you know i've wrote people and i've put them in my bible and i looked back and it looked and just like a lady that i went to high school with and you know it looked really bad for her she had cancer and they'd look really bad but you know she come through that surgery and she's doing real well now and and you know the the doctors were really surprised at how well everything went and you know it's just that you know it's the power of prayer and you have faith to believe and god can can do things and you just you sometimes you you you look back and you thank god all the times you know that you've seen little notes that you you've prayed for people and all of a sudden god's worked things out god's touched people and and all these different things that you look back you know you know sometimes you think you know you know the devil he likes to put he always tries to drag you down always try to put something in your way you know he always wants to fight you but you know you know you go back and you start looking at all the things that god's done he's like well about this and what about this and what about that and you know i tell you what you can't you can't think about the goodness of god and see the miracles that god's done and not and not have something to be joyous about and not and not just change your atmosphere and your whole attitude about things and you know the devil he'll he'll come at you and he that's his job and he's a good adversary but he may oppose us but he won't win but i just want to thank the lord for that so y'all just remember them as we prayed tonight and you know we know that god has all things in control amen so let's just all bow our heads i know there's many needs you know they've already been spoken over by uplifted hand and everything but we just want to continue to remember them our heavenly father lord jesus we just thank so thankful tonight lord to be in your house lord that we can come lord gather around your word lord together with those of like precious faith lord jesus we just pray that you just come tonight and help us lord get out of the way lord lord just get into one mind in one accord with you lord that you can come speak to us lord we just pray that you just break the bread of life to us tonight as we speak in the word lord

same yesterday today and forever the lord will know that you'll touch each one of these lord lord because you said that if we would ask lord we could receive knock and we shall it shall be opened unto us seek and we shall find lord so we just commit it to you lord we just put it in your hands lord because we know that's the best place to put it casting all our cares upon you would you care for us and father we just pray tonight you be with us lord be with brother luis says he's ministering there with for brother martin lord and all of the other the bride around the world lord the fivefold ministry lord as they carry them the gospel lord i pray that you be with each one strengthen them in a special way lord we commit all things to you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen psalms 34 verse 1 says i will bless the lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth my soul shall make her boast in the lord the humble shall hear thereof and be glad we'll magnify the lord with me and let us exalt his name together i sought the lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears they looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed this poor man cried and the lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles the angel of the lord encampeth round about them that fear him and delivered them o taste and see that the lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him oh fear the lord ye his saints for there is no want to them that fear him amen god bless you tonight you may be seated and i just want to take a little the title taste and see that the lord is good and y'all pray pray for me tonight but uh it's gonna be a little bit a little bit different maybe tonight because i want to talk about something that that i like to do i know it's going to be a little shocking to y'all but i won't talk about eating i know that's a little shocking maybe some of you but uh i didn't i didn't just get get to looking like this just haphazardly there's a little takes takes work takes dedication it takes a little you know richard used to tell everybody when i was growing up they had always asked me why he was so skinny and i was so big because richard say before i could get seconds aaron was having thirty-fourths i said well i'm sorry you're slow he said he just pushed me out of the way but you know you know i want to i want to talk about this right here because you know david is here and you know he's reading about the things that he has been through in his life and you know he said i sought the lord and he heard me and he delivered me from all my fears and he said this poor man cried and the lord heard him and saved him from all of his troubles and you know he's talking about all the things that that he had been through and you know the things that he had that he had experienced in his life and he stood there and he said oh taste and see that the lord is good you know if you've ever been through if you've ever had an experience of something you know you just can't wait to share it with somebody else you know you just it's it's an experience that you know you can talk to people about it but you know what you want people to experience it yourself you know uh as as uh wade always talks about german chocolate cake well you know i mean some people like german chocolate cake but some people don't but you know some people you know you can you can talk to people about it and you can show it to them but you know what some people they don't they don't know unless they experience that how good it is you know sometimes people you sit there and you know it's it's so it's you know when they start eating like brother dale likes to do sometimes you know he gets in there and you know he'll he'll tell you about how terrible that banana pudding is that y'all don't want any of it and he keeps saying this is not good this is not y'all don't want any of this see using a little that reverse psychology because you know but you know you know in times you know people they begin to express these things but you know what they want you to experience that too you know lots of times you know when somebody has something that's good you know and as the story goes you know they they put a they put a craving on you yeah why because it's what they've experienced what they're having you know it looks good to them you know somebody will come by and they'll have something that you want and you know it's like boy that looks good or boy that smells good well you know the thing is is if you don't experience you know because they can tell you how good it is but you've got to experience that for yourself you know brother branham said for us as christians he said how can we reach out to those in the world how can we reach out to our brothers and sisters he said it was very very simple he said all you got to do is be salty see another reference to food y'all might not cough that but but it goes back to eating but to have an experience and david said oh taste and see that the lord is good i want you to have an experience like i've had can you have it can you talk about the same experience that i mean god is coming and all these great things that happened to me when you come to and you see the things that david has come through and if it wasn't for the grace of god david would have never made it but you know what david was anointed god came to david and anointed him to be king and all the other problems that he had all the faults and failures that david had no matter what took place you know what god still had him to be king and he still had a place and he still had a purpose in his life no matter what david done and god had a place to put him and even you know even even though he had faults and failures and yet god still said he was a man after his own heart you know and so many times we can look at our lives and you know we we can look at things and say well you know we can always see look in the mirror and we always see our faults and our failures and everybody else can always see our felts and faults and failures and our issues and our problems well you know what everybody has those things but the problem is is is you know as as brother always talked about you know as a brother a man that that is really a holy ghost filled man you know if he falls down he doesn't stay down you know the thing is is the grace of god is there for you to get back up and to continue to run you know it's it's not it's not it's not for him that will it or him or rather but he said is god it shows mercy to a person to run this race you can't do it on your own you're not ever going to be worthy enough to do it but you know what but somebody's made you worthy to do this and you know you've had an e-there's an experience to have you can fall but you don't care do you understand that god's grace is there for you to get up and keep going not to go the same route you've been going not to be the same person that you've been but to be a new person in christ jesus to be a new man a new creature in christ jesus that's what god wants us to be oh taste and see that the lord is good many people you know they just go through the same thing and they and they experience the same things well you know it's time to have a different experience have a different change you know one of the one of the things that i was i was thinking about was you know we've we've had in in this epi this pandemic this this all this time that we've been going through and how everything's messed up and you know one of the things that we see in this in this pandemic having this this virus you know it changes people's taste you know it it affects people you know that's one of the things that changes is people are not able to taste and you know and and we see how today in the in the hour that we live you know people have always we've had so many people that that have you see people that have walked in the in the word and they they walked in things and you know and they they go through the same thing and you know it goes through the it's the same process but then all of a sudden you know there's a there's something that takes place well you know some people what what has happened is you know they're just going along with the flow or they they just they're just having a mental uh episode you know it's just all in their mind because you know you you can't you can't live this life you can't be a christian and live a christian life by having just a mental faith it just can't it just can't be you know i try to live just try to live this in myself in my humanity i'll never i'll never advance in this christian walk i'll never overcome just being just as a normal person but you know many people that that's the way they've done and it's like why well because you know they've had some kind of experience at at some point in their life you know something's happened you know they've they've had some kind of emotion or something that's taken place but you know what that's not going to carry you all the way because you know they're somewhere along the way people have gotten off track people have gotten where they where they got twisted in the word something that's happened to them and they've gotten away from it but you know the thing is you've got to come back to because there's only one person that's going to lead you and that's jesus christ and you know and if jesus christ you've always got to come back to the word it's the word that brings you through you know is here in the in the message speak to the rock brother man was is speaking of of moses and the children of israel in their journey and you know god put him on this journey and you know he was going to feed him on this journey and you know he was going to take care of them all the way through their journey you know they didn't have to worry about nothing right you know i mean they had somebody to lead them they had a they had a cloud by day they had a pillar of fire by night all they had to do is line up by the word that was given by the prophet that's all they had to do when they were down there in egypt and they were crying out for a deliverer and god told and he found go and talk to moses and he told moses he said i've heard the cry of my people by the reason of their task masters and he told them i said now it's you to go down there and deliver them but i'm going to give you the words see moses was inefficient in himself to do it but god called him and told him listen i'm going to give you the signs and i'm going to give you aaron to be your mouthpiece that you're going to speak and aaron will speak for you and everything that you have need of no matter what all you got to do is trust in me and so when when and everything that they had to do all they had to do was follow exactly what moses told them to do when they when it came to the day as as the passover came when they when they got ready to leave you know they had to take the lamb they had to roast it with fire the whole thing had to be roasted together had to eat unleavened bread they had to have their shoes they had to have their staff everything had to be done they had to slay the lamb put the blood on the doorpost and on the lintel and they had to get ready to go but you know what moses told them everything that they had to do they didn't have to think for themselves just follow the word that's all i had to do and when they got out you know and as soon as as soon as i got out of egypt the first thing they had to do was complain they had they got their mind on everything else except for what the prophet told them they didn't believe and you know they were so here it is it says he says now that he said yes sir i can hear moses say now the children is a run up and say we are going to what are we going to do for bread now we ain't got any bread god will take care of that he said long as you come out step on the promise god will take care of the rest of it well how are we going to eat god will take care of that well we're just a little bit hungry you need a little fasting late down that night went to sleep when he got up the next morning there was manna all over the ground bread laying everywhere that's the way god does it see so they went out picked it up said it tasted like i said oh my this tastes just like honey he said oh my that bread never ceased to fall as long as they was in the journey every night there was a new supply you could just gather enough there to last one day the next day you had to come gather new what a type of the holy ghost in our journey them in the natural when he come out and separate from the world separate from the world god supplies our good times he supplies our bread he supplies everything that we have need of amen he told them in the natural he would do it he would do it he will do it for us in the spiritual and it goes on he talks about how the bread they could only gather each night they could only gather the bread for that day because i had to go out and gather more he said it would get wiggle tails and it would rot because they couldn't hold anything over they had to gather new because you know there was it was a new gathering it was a new feasting every single day and so you know he says and so when he goes on he's talking about pentecost having having wiggle tales in and everything he says when he goes he says your experience are getting old something you had 20 20 years ago what are you right now what does it mean now he said i'm not yelling at you but i feel good look that's right he said you've got to get a new baptism every day every day every day just keep going every day no no any limit to it you try to say well now look a month ago i had a wonderful experience he said that testimony don't work what about it now right now a new one right now god reigned it every night so when it comes see it's a it's a happening every single day we've got to go and gather the manna that god which is the holy ghost so you've got to feed on the word every single day and god has something for you every single day and you know they had to go out and i had to gather that that manna every single day and you know and his and his blessings are new every day every morning he has something for you and you know the thing is is we don't make time for him because if we don't make time for him then you know what we miss out on god's blessings we miss out on what god has for us because we get so tied up with all the other things in the world and they're more important you know all these things that are going to pass away all this cannon fodder and all these other things that people want to struggle and strive over when we forget to put god first when he said seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these other things will be added unto you he said when the holy ghost come on the day of pentecost they had to wait 10 days that's right for it to come but never had to wait from then on when the heart was ready the holy ghost was there he said how long will it be we'll find out he said now moses said to aaron you go out and get several almers full of this and bring it in and put it behind the holies of holies now it won't spoil back there and then all down through the generations and every time that a man when he was was in the priesthood he had a right to come into the priesthood to come in behind by the holy the holy place and get a mouthful of that manna he'd taste it now what is this this is just like our fathers received when they started a journey uh-huh that tastes good that's good taste it every priest coming in could go back there in these omers and get a handful of it and get them a great big mouthful and he'd chew it oh how good it was what a privileged character he was to eat some of the original manna and that's a that's exactly the type of the holy ghost when the church started its journey 2 000 years ago on our journey to the millennium hallelujah god promised he'd supply our needs and the first time when they come over and receive the holy ghost the power of god began to fall upon them they lost all their bashfulness and all their shamefulness they ran out in the streets and began to dance in the spirit and carry on and he said then on the day of pentecost and they were all staggering around the mantle was falling down out of heaven our manna all right they said how long is this going to last brother peter said it's for you and for your children to them that's a far off even as many as the lord our god shall call god shall call shall have glory to god brother every man or woman that comes into this divine holy ghost priesthood has a right to get a genuine heartful of the original baptism of the holy ghost that fell on the day of pentecost the same signs the same power the same demonstration the same feeling the same action glory not something like like it the original right you know not just some cheap imitation but the original the lord said i'm going to store up a whole lot of this because there's going to be many generations so every time one comes in i'm going to give him a great big heart full of it amen i'm so glad i can say i'm one of them yes sir look peter just lost all his dignity and everything jumped up on a soapbox and began to preach my soapbox preacher yes sir what was it he had the holy ghost he was eating on that godly manna and today it's the same thing we're in the journey in the spiritual just like the journey was in the natural and it fell for them every time they wanted it fail it falls for us the same way god's got a whole big heaven full of it that's right it's for you and to your children them that's owensburg kentucky that's where he was at preaching and as many as the lord our god our god shall call it's for every one of them many as wants it god's got it for them many here on their journey i want you to see another thing it tastes like honey is that right honey the poet said i believe david said it tastes like honey in the rock and he said every tastes like and say the lord is good it tastes like honey in the rock did you ever taste it i seen old baptized holy ghost things just sitting so paralyzed by the power of god they couldn't move they just go [Music] just god blessing their souls and they couldn't do nothing else licking their lips say amen and then he goes on talking about david being the shepherd and putting the honey on the rock and they begin to lick on the rock and they've eaten that honey because that's what was so good was the honey was so good because you know they all they wanted to eat was the honey because the honey was good but the thing is is when they put it on the rock what they what they were needing was in the honey but they wanted to eat the honey because the honey was good but this is for you and for them that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call and then when they had this manna the manna falls just like it was back then they had they had the manna that fell for them every single day and they had to go out there and get it but you know what there was a time when they went out there and and when they when the manna started to fall moses told aaron god told moses to go out there and get it and set it up in a special place it was going to be in the holy of holies and for them to store it up and he said every time the man would come into the priesthood he could go in there and eat that same original manna now it rotted every single day then they had to go out there and they had to gather it they had to go and pick it up every day and you know then it rotted but they had to go out there and every single day but there was a time when there was a place for a man to go to and that he could always have the the manna brother ram said that that would you know in the time if they didn't gather enough during the day you know they run out they got hungry till the next time manna fell but you know he said now there's a place he said you can come day night whenever time you want to there's a place that you can come to and gather in and take a part of this manna that god has stored up and you can imagine this this man that had entered into the priesthood and what what a great thing it was you know because here here's this man you know our forefathers ate manna in the wilderness god rained bread down they tasted like honey and it was so marvelous that every single day we could go out there and pick up this this bread and it was right there and all we had to do was pick it up and gather and eat it and you know it was so great and you know you know well we heard all these stories but you know there come a time when he was able to go in there and you know he could walk behind that veil and he could actually partake of that of that manna and it was the same thing not just not just reading about something or hearing about something but he had the opportunity to experience the same thing that they did to go behind the veil and taste that heavenly manner that wasn't just just words on a page or it just wasn't somebody's ideas just something that somebody tried to paint but it was an opportunity for him to experience that and it's the same thing as he said we received it the same thing on our journey but we have as being made kings and priests that we have the opportunity to go behind the veil that we can go behind the veil and eat of the manna we don't you know because you know the veil the veil was was there and you know aaron and the and the high priest could only go in there at a certain time of year when they brought in the in the blood and went in and you know then brett brown said that he could go in and he could partake of that manna that was before the the ark and when he walked into this kind of glory there he was he was able to partake of it but in our day you know when jesus came he was he was the the offering that was made that the the the veil was rent and when the veil was ran in two then then he said he said then the access was made that you and i can go in at any time day or night and walk into the holy of play and the scripture tells us now he said he said you know it's not that we have to worry about being being so correct as as the old testament you know they were so worried but he said come boldly before the throne of grace so you know there's a way that's been made that you can come boldly before it that you can go in there and you know what there is all of the manna that you could eat he said the heavens was full of it and he said you know they put those armors of the manna in in the before the ark and you know he said no matter how much they ate it didn't disappear they could eat all they could do all they wanted to and you know what they were still more when they got when they got done just like us no matter how much you experience of god no matter how much you get into god you know there's more than more than you have you can continue just to eat and grow and and man and just and just feast on it and you know what there's more that god has for you and you know it produces the same it produces the exact same thing as it did as he said because as it was on the day of pentecost on the day of pentecost he said when that heavenly manna when peter went out there and preached the message he said it's unto you and to your children of them that's a far off even as many as the lord our god shall call and so if whatever wherever they went whoever god called you know they had they had the right just the same right as everybody else to it and they could have it they could feast on it and they could have all that they wanted and he said it would produce the exact same thing the life that that he lived he said the things that i do shall you do also so he if he done it then it would produce the exact same thing to eat on the to eat on the word to and and it's available to you to eat and it'll manifest it'll do the exact same thing so you know if if it was the same way if god doesn't change it and he's made the same offer to everyone that you have the same access to it and if you eat on the same word and you feast on the same word and you have the same experience and it's the same holy ghost that they had that was back there and he said they lost all their shamefulness he said they lost all their bashfulness all these things you know they became bold well you know the thing is you don't have to stand around and wonder if god's going to do anything for you you know because many times people you know it's so amazing people want to get up and and then you know we talk about praying for people and they won't they want to pray and they say well you know i'm praying over this and i'm praying over there well you know that's a great thing to do because you know you can't pray enough but you know the thing is is realize you know you know if god started you on this journey people are trying you know and i don't i don't want to discount anything i don't want to discourage anybody but i want you to understand you know you can pray through and everybody you know they're going to pray through they're going to pray through but there's comes a time you know you pray through and you hand it over to god well then you know what you don't go out in the ground at this time and keep digging all the seed up you know if you have a you know wage plant in the garden and everything you know you just don't go out there planting one day and keep digging it up well let's see what happens no you're leaving alone well if you're going to give it if you're going to turn your cares over to god then quit trying to carry them let god do it but you know the thing is i'm not discounting praying but the thing is when we pray then you know what prayer requires one thing there's one thing about praying you know the thing is there's you can't worry about it you can't have faith and worry you can't pray over something and then and trying to figure it out right what do you just pray over and give it to god and say well lord i'm going to turn it over to you and then you know what i don't worry about it anymore you know i'm not trying to figure figure it out you know because many times the devil wants to get in our minds and he's like well how's this going to work and how's that going to work and this and that and you know what it's like listen god has it i'm not toting this thing anymore you know he said come unto me all the you that labor and are heavy laden and i'll give you rest and he said you know he said come and learn of me he said for my yoke is easy my burden is light so you know the thing is many times we get burdened down with things and the thing and things of life bother us and they get in our way and everything like that but you know what he wants us to know that you know if we give it to him he said he said are y'all his yoke is easy and his burden is light well let me tell you something brothers and sisters you know what if we ever got the burden of him then why are we carrying all the burdens of ourselves why are we carrying our burdens when he said if we would just give them to him he's got a burden for us to carry you know you know people get so worried they get so wrapped up in living a christian life and all these things well you know what if we could just rest on him then you know what he's going to carry us all the way then there's a there's a place that we can rest in him but you know he said he said the burden was light well then how in the world if you've got if you've got this light burden from him and people people you know they get so bound down by things of the world and you know just living a life i mean day-to-day turmoil and everything like that and people get so wrapped up in these things and then they say well i don't know if i'm gonna be able to make it from one day to the next and it's like you know i'm just ready to give up you know i'm just trying to find a place you know i just i just want to quit i just want to quit i don't know what else to do well you know the thing is is the problem is is you've not taken it to the master you've not taken it to him and laid it down and just give it to him say listen i'm not carrying this anymore lord you said that i could lay this all on you that you and you would carry this well you know sometimes when we get to the point where we get sick and tired of being sick and tired of dealing with these things and we come to the place where we can lay our burdens down and you know many people they've gotten into the place even even in a christian experience where people just want to try to live the christian life their self and they think they're going to be good enough and they think they can they're going to be holy enough and they think they're going to be righteous says enough but you know what there's nothing in you that's going to amount to anything because everything that you have is filthy rags you're not going to have anything but you know the thing is is when we get to a place that we can come and we can we can go before the lord and we can tell him lord i realize i'm nothing in you without you lord i know that i'm i'm dirty and i'm lost and i'm undone then you know i can turn it over to him then you know what then he can make you a new creature a new creation in christ jesus but you know until that happens you're not ever going to change you know there's many people they want to be religious but you know what religious don't get you anywhere holy your holy self holy don't get anywhere self righteous don't get you anywhere but there's a place that we come that you know i'm not i don't have my own righteousness i have his righteousness he who knew no sin became sin for me that i can become his righteousness i can become the righteousness of god so then you know what it's not me the thing is you know what i need to put myself under the blood every day there's a dying out every single day because you know the biggest problem that aaron roberts has is aaron roberts i know other people may think it's me but it's not it's me i stand in my own way i don't worry about everybody else getting in my way i get my own way and you know we do the same thing we get in our own way but you know there's a place that we can come to that we can unload all these things and we can we can go to god and allow him to be lord and savior of our lives you know to be a lord for him to be lord then he's he's the one that's in control he's the one that's calling the shots he's the one that's leading the way but you know the thing is we don't if we don't if we don't keep our eyes on what god has called us then you know then we all get everything all mixed up everything is all messed up you know when the children of israel when when god called him out there and told him he said i've got a land flowing with milk and honey i've got a place to carry you to when they come out when they come out of egypt and you know here they are they didn't they didn't own anything why because the egyptians owned it all right they didn't even own their own sales their children that they had were slaves and they could do anything they wanted to with them amen and you and you look at all the bondage that they had to face down there and they didn't have anything right but you know what they had a promise from god that who they were they were the children of abraham and god had made a promise to abraham and all of his seed but you know what they sat down there in bondage because they allowed themselves to get wrapped up in a place that they didn't belong but you know what when it come time for them to come out then you know what they had to cry and they had to bleed and beg and plead with for a savior and when the lord sent him then you know what then they wanted to fight moses they got out there you know their shoes never wore out they never got sick nothing nothing nothing was against them they had god had an answer for them all the way and then when he give them this heavenly manner you know nobody else had this but here when they received this manna when it failed you know what they got to the place where it become common to them it become common to them and they stood up there and told moses we loathe this light bread when god is blessing them and giving them miracles and showing all these things and then they say well we don't like this we don't like this we're not happy but you know here it was god was trying to lead them all the way through giving them showing them you know they they they was not happy they they they didn't have faith to believe what god was doing for them they were not god was not pleased with them you know here they are out there well you know egypt don't look so bad now when egypt got out of sight and they seemed to forget all the problems that they had in in egypt all the things that they had to face in egypt you know many people they you know they they want to they want they want to get so close to god that they're not con you know they're not under condemnation but they still want to get close enough to the world where you know they still they they you know it still feels good and you know there's there's things in their lives that they don't want they don't want to give up but you know they want to live close enough to this where you know they still they still have that that that longing for for the things of the world and they still lean this way long enough but you know they want to get close over here where you know it gets it gets uh you know well sometimes sometimes when brother wade preaches he he just steps on my toes and you know he's real hard on me and you know things he says and it just really oh i you know you know and i just want to get out for money that condemnation so i'm just going to get over here far enough but then i'm going back over here yeah and then when he starts brodel's gonna say something i'm gonna ease back over here yeah and then and you know it's so much easier to go this direction than this trying to go this way gotta overcome all it that that flash is hard to deal with sometimes you on a slippery slope because you know what there comes a time you know we need to get past all of that you know because you know the hour is late and we don't know when things we need to make sure that we're right we need to be exactly where we need to be we need to have every you know because you don't nobody's promised tomorrow we don't we don't know what's going to take place none of us are promised tomorrow we don't know what's going to take place but you know we always have to be ready at every moment but you know if we if we if god has given all these things to us and he's blessed us with these things does it just become common to us is it just become just like normal things well you know it's just it's just the same thing that you know wade's going to get up here and he's going to preach the same thing brother dale's going to get up here and preach the same thing we're going to hear this same thing brother boyd's going to get up here and he's going to sing the same songs and you know brother dawn's going to get up here and he's going to read the same scripture on sunday morning responsive reading or whatever you know it's just like well we're just going to do the same thing we just do the same thing we're just going to go through the motions well the problem is if we're just going through the motions are you looking for god do you see god in any of that or he's just like well we're just we're just here just i mean any dead fish can float downstream but you know take something with some fight to it to fight up upstream to fight the waters you know i mean and i i'm guilty just like everybody else you know you know somebody said you want to get anointed preaching just preach on yourself well you know sometimes that's what you do you just preach on yourself but you know you know sometimes you know because you know i don't have to have somebody get up and and look at me i look in the mirror every day i know i know who i am i don't fool myself you know you think you and if we if we think we you know well you know i think i'm okay i think i'm a pretty good guy you know i think i think i'm doing okay well you know what if you if you look in the mirror and you see see things within you you need to look in the scripture we need to look in god's mirror we need we need to look in and see and see ourselves and not try to not try to coat things over you know we need to actually look and see i i don't need somebody to tell me these things i i you know because i you know if if you if you're honest with god god's honest with you you know you're not god doesn't god doesn't fool you it's like you're okay it's okay it's okay i don't know if y'all know god does that for y'all y'all let me know i ain't never had that happen i mean you know because you know sometimes god just brings one word to you and then you realize you know i i didn't i you know that's that's something for me to straighten out you know you know you know and and sometimes god sends people your way and they just absolutely with no shadow it out they're there they just it's like a cheese grater on your nerves just like that and you know and lots of times people you know they're just like you know what i wasn't who i was i gave him a piece of my mind and it's like well brother and sister y'all might need to hold on to that piece of mind you got because you don't know how much you got to go around but you know sometimes sometimes we and what the problem is is sometimes these things happen and you know what we don't we don't take a step back and say you know what that was for me god sent somebody my way and they'll go and god's going to see how i'm going to react to it and sometimes like well will bless god go talk to me like that and sometimes you know you know sometimes it's it's it's so much it's it's so much easier just to just blow up and just get all angry instead of just take a step back take a deep breath and think lord are you you know any even though it you know just it hurts your feelings it steps on your toes sometimes it makes you angry sometimes it makes you sad i mean something you know and it's like lord you know what can i get out of this maybe that maybe the presentation wasn't the best but you know what's it the truth and you know and sometimes people you know we don't realize but you know sometimes somebody may say something that's harsh to us and you know they're not they're not meaning to be harsh and you know and sometimes you know you can you can get offended by it and you know and and you'll carry that for the longest time where you're just offended by what somebody said and you and you don't even realize that god's trying to speak to you you're more you're more interested in licking your wounds and having a pity party than you are saying you know that is for that is something for me that i can actually take and then i can actually benefit from that know and you know because you know you know many times i i feel like and maybe maybe i'm wrong but i just i just want to say this you know because sometimes i feel like that that people have they when brother like for instance brother wade that's what i want to get to is i'm talking preach on brother waiting up anyway uh you know what what brother but don't worry the way he gets up and he says you know everybody sleeps in church and it's like people don't care that they that they would just automatically go to sleep nobody seems like they want to fight it and you know i don't i don't mean to step on anybody's toes but i'm you know you know i'm i'm guilty just like everybody else i'm human and you know what i just you know and and so i can get offended by it and you know sometimes it's it's like you know the thing is is what are you going to do about it you can you can take and say well you know just like you like i was saying you can take that as a situation where you know i can just get upset about it and i can i can sit and i can just i can just hold that and let it fester or then i can just take that and say you know what that was something for me and you know what and and you know then i can say listen you know because i try not to sleep in church you know and sometimes i have close my eyes and different things but you know the thing is is you know are you you know i'm not you know like pulling out a pillow or a blanket or anything you know but you know i mean there's sometimes people just like you know they just want to but you know i mean but when those type things happen do you try to do anything about it and you know and and i i i just feel this way because you know because you know sometimes when things like like that happen when when somebody says things so you you know it's time to take it take a step back and look and say you know well lord help me with this you know and and you know and some people may say well you know they may think well you know well you're not trying to do anything well you know i it may not look like i'm trying but you know the thing is you know i i you know you said well i prayed about you know i'm trying to i'm trying to do better i'm trying you know and you know you you've got to take that and you've got to you've got to move forward with that and you've got to put that in the hands of god and try to do something about it and you know it's just like you know there's so many times that and petty things that take place and and you know brother dale will say you know here's here's these little things that people try to do and you know brother dale i don't know how many times he talked about people slamming the doors and slamming the doors and slamming the doors and you know and and you know and and brother dale would say you know listen when people are praying let's keep the noise down let's not talk so loud you know let's not slam doors and you know what and and some people it it they didn't you know they'd i mean do whatever they could you could put automatic door closures on there that they would just ease the doors closed and they were gonna slam the door somehow they'd find one and it was just like you know it's just like it's something that's inside people but you know and you know i mean this is like off the off the subject a little bit but you know you know it it's it's things like that that you know are we trying to to go with god are we allowing things to stand in our way are we are we're being you know we a hindrance to somebody else because when we come to church and we allow these things to take place you know are we trying to help somebody are we trying to hinder somebody and you know the thing is if we if we could just get into christ you know and you know that's what that's what the word is for you know it's just like when you know when john took that book and you know he ate the book in revelation 10 you know it was sweet in his mouth but it was bitter in his belly you know the word is good but you know what sometimes the word is hard the word is cutting. and many times we allow things to take place you know that we don't you know and sometimes it takes somebody it takes a preacher it takes somebody it takes your mom and dad it takes somebody to point things out to you and you know sometimes well you know he got me that he got me today he got me today and then you know what and no and it's not and it's like what lord do i you know if that's me then lord let me let me straighten this up and then and you know don't think about it anymore the rest of the time until church time and then you know it's like oh yeah i forgot about that and you know and sometimes you know it takes it takes you know a mental note even if you actually have to write the note yourself right physically write a note and you write it down and sometimes you know it takes it it takes the you know because sometimes you won't you won't think things but you know if we get in the word and if we read the word and we study on the word and it's not and it's not and it's not learning you know different you know all these different things but you know the thing is as we begin to see ourselves in here then we can begin to see where we fall we begin to see where we're failing and if we get in the word and you know we begin to eat old man it's so good well you know what sometimes it ain't too good but you know what as you begin to eat that words you know because you know how many how many have have went through a battle went through a trial went through a struggle and you know it was you didn't think he was ever going to make it through you struggled with something whatever it was and you and you battled and you battled and you battled and how many people you cried and you prayed and you know you know you just done everything you could i mean you were seeking god for something even if it was the baptism of the holy ghost or whatever it is was in your life that you battled this thing and you kept battling and he kept battling well then later alone you know you got god brought you through you overcome something and then you look back at that and you're like man that was so great you know we don't we don't enjoy the journey going through it but sometimes when god points us back to that and you think man that was so great well you know that's the way it is you get in the word and god will show you and then it's so great that you know i can i can praise god for what god's brought me from i'm not what i want to be i'm not what i ought to be but thank god i'm not what i used to be because i can point back to what i was and i can see the rope and i can see what god has delivered me from and what god has brought me to and then you know i can stand there and say oh this is so great this is just like honey in the rock to me because i can see where god's brought me from i can see what what the old aaron roberts used to be and that old aaron roberts is dead and you know and i'm still continuing to grow i still got battles i still got thoughts and failures but you know what i'm still overcoming every day i'm still overcoming every day there's still a greater thing that's coming and you know we can begin to feed on that and we begin to see those things where then all of a sudden we see the growth taking place we you know as we go through these battles and whatever comes our way then you know what god is leading us god is showing us there's grace for us to overcome well you know the thing is if the grace is only there if you want it the grace is only there for you to overcome if you want it but the thing is is you've got to have the desire and you've got to come to him because he's going to carry you the way but you know what you've got to receive it and if and so is it you know is it just something that's become common to us are we just we're just going through the motions or is there something that we say hey i really call it a spiritual vision that i see where i need to be because you know what the thing is is we don't have much longer and you know what i want to be exactly where god has called me to be i want to be on the front lines i don't want to be on the in the back somewhere i want to be fighting the good fight i want to be right where god wants me to be i want to be on fire i don't want to be cold i don't want to be lukewarm but i want to be on fire for god doing his will i want to be found when he comes doing his will i want to be called a good and faithful servant why because i've stood in the post of duty and do the done the things that god wanted me to do i don't want to be caught in the wrong place the thing is is god's got to bring you to the place that you you've got to get to the place where god wants you to be you know god's got a place for you to be and that's where you need to be and i was thinking you know just as one of my favorite stories in the scripture it's about food also i know y'all i got plenty i got plenty the bible's full of it's just it's all about eating good good good but you know one of my one of my favorite scriptures in the scripture and is in first kings where elijah you know god sent elijah out and he told ahab them he said it's not going to rain until i call for it he said there won't even be due right but you know god called him to the brookette sheriff and set him down there and you know it was just him and the ravens by that brook and the ravens fed him and he sat there beside that brook you know god had a place for his prophet to be to feed but you know what was so amazing during that time he's sitting there alone with god and you know what was going on during that time the scripture tells us brother brown talks about it you know there was a there was a widow woman and you know she was out there and she was going through the last bit of her meal in the last bit of her oil and there was the prophet over there next to that brook and he was resting relaxing getting fed and just relaxing and enjoying the presence of the lord and the scripture tells us he said i've prepared a web at a woman that she's going to feed you he's like well you know what he's doing pretty good sitting beside the brook there with the ravens feeding him i don't know why he needs why he needs that woman that little woman is over there worried and struggling and seeing her son being malnourished and looks out there every single day and sees that famine and seeing everything dry up and you know she couldn't see anything good in all of that you know what god already had a way made for her and the prophet said over there and supernatural feasting and that woman sitting there and and all of that time when the brook dried up you know after he had been through all of that then he come over to that widow woman and she got down to her very last bit and got down to where she had nothing and he went to her and and he said bring me something to drink in a famine and he said oh wait bring me a little cake can you bring me something to eat in the midst of a famine he said can you bring me i mean a stranger the scripture never tells us she knows she knew who he was but we'll give will you give of all that you have oh yeah facing life and death and she said we've got two little sticks here and she said we're getting ready to make these little cakes for me and my son and we're gonna die and he said go do what you're going to do but he said make me a little cake first and you think about that you know when when you've got nothing left and then she said i'm i'm gonna make this a little cake and give you water in the midst of this famine in this condition that we're in and when she decided that she was going to give of her necessity it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't of her abundance it's when she had nothing else to give she gave all that she had to give but she gave to him first and when she done that the prophet told her said listen for the rest of the time of this famine said you'll never run out of meal you'll never run out of oil and you know she made that little cake and gave him that little bit of water out of her necessity out of her want she gave to him but then god come on the scene and blessed her and he was getting she and so you know here he was on the the prophet on the backside getting this supernatural feeding but you know what she and herself somehow she knew the lord spoke to her whatever but she gave of her of her of what she had when she gave all that she had you know when jesus speaks to the of the widow woman given the might you know and they said well you know what why why he's you know listen listen listen everybody has to give you know and he said she'll be honored for giving out of her lack you know even even when brother brown talked about sister hattie wright given putting money toward the church and you know he was going to give her money back to her but yet and and that you know god told him you know don't do that don't take away sister hattie's blessing she sowed that when you look i mean they was poor as poor can be but she wanted to but she wanted to serve god and she gave out of her lack she gave to him she gave to the church and then when brother branham came to her he began to speak to her about the things that about the squirrels and the different things you know and he began to speak and that's when sister had he said you know that's nothing but the truth brother brent when she began to speak then god turned around and said give her what she asked for and when so when when we give we give out of the abundance but the thing is is do we give our all right you know many times people can give other talents well you know it's it's not a struggle for some people to do things but do we give our all right is it is it out of your out of all that you have do you give of that when we when we give all to god god god don't want 99 and a half him on 99 and nine tens he wants all do we give our all to him because if we won't if we give our all to him then you know what he said he said because there is a blessing in that if you're going to feed on the word of god you're going to feed on the things of god then you know what you have to give up have we given our all to god because he gave his all for us is our all as the song says is our all on the altar tonight have you give we can we can feed on god has a lot for us but you know as as i believe it was uh moody i believe it was he said god never turns us away empty unless we're full of ourselves if we've not emptied ourselves out then you know what god can only do so much but do we empty all ourselves out because we want to receive from what god has for us let's let's feed on this manna that god has given us amen let's let's not let's not look at it as this light bread let's let's not look at it as just something common but let's feed on this let's feed on this word let's give us lay every side of every weight and everything that's easily besets us and let's run this race and let's feed on this word let's let's let's do all let's be found in what god wants us to do you know and i i want to share one other thing before i close and you know you know when the when the syrophoenician woman was there and you know she come to jesus and she had a need the syrophoenician woman come and you know she called him son of david and he and he didn't answer he you know she was a dog he didn't have he didn't have nothing to do with her but when she said lord he realized that he was her lord you know she had a she had a child that needed needed a touch and and and he was like you know i don't i don't we don't give it we don't give our bread to the dogs you know we're not one and he and she said true lord he said but the dog seeks of the crumbs they'll fall from the master's table and you know what you're so much better than that you don't have to eat crumbs there's no crumbs at god's table for you there's more than you can eat because you know the more you the more you desire the more he gives hey what he has has more and he desires to give you more than you than you could ever think because he said you know if we would open up you know that he would open up the windows of heaven and if we would just try him amen and everybody's like well you know i pay my tithes and i pay these things but you know what do we pay with our do we pay with our time do we do we pay with you know and and many times people's like well you know i i don't spend all my time in the prayer closet i don't prayer i don't put all my time in this but you know the thing is is do we do we step back and say what is it that god would have us do you know what there's time to read the bible there's time to pray but you know there's time to sit down and pray for each other and you know you know what you know some of the best things that's happened to me in my life is when somebody's picked up the phone or sent me a text you know and sometimes people don't even realize just you know you you think well it's just it's just it's just quick and you know but i tell you what sometimes somebody sent you know i've had times people just
