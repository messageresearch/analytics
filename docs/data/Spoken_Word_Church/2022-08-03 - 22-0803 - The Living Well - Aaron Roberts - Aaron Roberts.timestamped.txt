[14:22] john chapter four beginning verse six
[14:24] says
[14:24] now jacob's well was there jesus
[14:27] therefore being worried with his journey
[14:29] set thus on the whale
[14:31] and it was about the sixth hour there
[14:33] cometh a woman of samaria to draw water
[14:36] jesus saith unto her give me to drink
[14:38] for his disciples were going away under
[14:40] the city to buy meat
[14:42] then saith the woman of samaria unto him
[14:44] how is it that thou being a jew ask us
[14:47] drink of me which am
[14:49] a woman of samaria for the jews have no
[14:52] dealings with the samaritans
[14:54] jesus answered and said unto her if thou
[14:57] knewest
[14:58] the gift of god
[15:00] and who it is that saith to thee give me
[15:03] to drink thou would have asked of him
[15:06] and he would have given thee living
[15:08] water
[15:09] the woman saith unto him sir thou has
[15:11] nothing to draw with and the well is
[15:14] deep from whence then hast thou that
[15:16] living water or thou greater than our
[15:19] father jacob which gave us the well and
[15:21] drank thereof himself and his children
[15:23] and his cattle jesus
[15:25] answered and said unto her whosoever
[15:28] drink of this water shall thirst again
[15:30] but whosoever drink of the water that i
[15:33] shall give him shall never thirst but
[15:35] the water that i shall give him shall be
[15:38] in him a well of water springing up into
[15:42] everlasting life amen god bless you
[15:44] tonight you can have your seats
[15:48] and
[15:53] this is from the ma i want to read this
[15:54] quote this is from the message
[15:56] remembering the lord
[16:01] and brother brown says
[16:03] he said the immoral
[16:05] woman that jesus
[16:07] found up at cecar up there
[16:10] that she was a samaritan which was
[16:11] rather
[16:12] an off-cast people that that really
[16:15] believed god they was about half jew and
[16:17] half gentile and there was a race they
[16:19] believed in god and this little moral
[16:22] woman in her condition very marred by
[16:24] sin and one day perhaps had got
[16:26] discouraged with all the traditions of
[16:28] the elders of pots and kettles and
[16:30] washings and so forth she went out one
[16:32] day to the same old jacobs well up there
[16:35] and she was going to let down her bucket
[16:37] to get some water and she changed
[16:39] springs oh how she can remember that
[16:42] there was one setting there that said in
[16:44] him was living water what a thrill it
[16:46] was to her when that living whale
[16:49] revealed her sins and told her where she
[16:52] was wrong and described what she had did
[16:55] to her and it put a message in her heart
[16:57] that set her on fire with the glory of
[16:59] god and into the city and to the
[17:02] men and so i just want to speak on the
[17:05] living well and what caught my attention
[17:07] was where brother branham says and that
[17:10] living well spoke to her
[17:12] and so jesus was you know sitting there
[17:14] on the well that day and was looking but
[17:16] you know we know the scripture says that
[17:19] he had need to go by samaria because he
[17:21] there was one for him to come to to
[17:23] speak to that day and it was hard but
[17:25] you know it was so it was so when you
[17:28] read the scripture and brother branham
[17:29] begins to speak of this woman and you
[17:30] see the kind of condition that the woman
[17:32] lived in and her background and all that
[17:35] kind of stuff and even here he talks
[17:37] about you know she grew up and become
[17:39] discouraged with things that was going
[17:40] on and you know there's things that
[17:42] happen in life that's not always our
[17:44] fault and things that get out of our
[17:46] control that we can't we can't control
[17:48] the things that happen to us but you
[17:49] know we just have to do the best we can
[17:51] but you know god is is mindful of those
[17:54] things he's mindful because you know
[17:56] there's never been a day in your life
[17:58] there's never been anything that's come
[17:59] across your path that god didn't know
[18:02] about ahead of time there wasn't
[18:03] predestinated that he knew what's going
[18:04] to take place that was going to happen
[18:06] to you but with but the scripture tells
[18:08] us with every
[18:10] avenue whatever problem that comes our
[18:12] way whatever trial or tribulation he
[18:14] said there's a way of escape that's made
[18:16] for us so god made a way that we would
[18:18] overcome whatever come our way so we
[18:20] look at we you know as we get
[18:22] discouraged sometimes people get upset
[18:24] with things but you know what god's made
[18:26] a way
[18:27] and you know there is a way made and i
[18:29] was so thankful that you know we have a
[18:31] place to come to and many times the
[18:33] problem is is we get things in our lives
[18:35] that we don't know how to handle where
[18:36] there's a place to come to
[18:38] and what was so what was so great about
[18:40] this woman to live in the moral immoral
[18:43] life and all the things that she had
[18:44] went through in her life and and all the
[18:46] things that she had to deal with but you
[18:48] know what jesus come to where she was
[18:50] going to be
[18:51] jesus crossed her path one day so he
[18:54] knew where she was going to be and he
[18:56] sat there waiting on the whale waiting
[18:58] for her
[18:59] so the whale was there for her because
[19:01] he began because he knew she come to
[19:04] draw water natural water but you know it
[19:06] was time for her to receive spiritual
[19:09] water because that's exactly what she
[19:11] had a longing for and had a desire and
[19:13] jesus was there to meet her need he come
[19:16] across her path to give her what she had
[19:18] need of now she didn't realize what was
[19:20] going to take place but you know what
[19:21] jesus knew where she was at and what she
[19:23] had need of and brothers and sisters i
[19:25] want you to know something tonight you
[19:26] know whatever you go through in life
[19:28] whatever happens thank god god knows
[19:30] ahead of time what's going to come your
[19:32] way he's going to have he's already got
[19:34] a way made he's already got your
[19:35] escapement the problem is is we don't
[19:37] have our eyes on the whale we don't have
[19:40] our eyes on jesus to know where he's
[19:42] leading us to
[19:44] but i'm so thankful you know because we
[19:45] can come into this oasis tonight because
[19:47] this place is an oasis here for us to
[19:50] come here and we can draw on living
[19:52] water we can receive what we have need
[19:54] of tonight you say well i come tired i
[19:57] come sick i i come defeated whatever it
[20:00] is well guess what there is a place as
[20:01] brother branham said this is a place of
[20:03] refreshing this is a place where the
[20:05] holy ghost will refresh you and he'll
[20:08] touch you from the top of your heads the
[20:10] soles of your feet and he will renew you
[20:12] and strengthen you and he will renew you
[20:14] in the inner man so that you overcome
[20:17] the outer man and let me tell you
[20:19] brothers and sisters i i hadn't felt
[20:21] good today and everything but you know i
[20:23] tell you what i'm not giving up on what
[20:25] because i've come here to speak
[20:27] something because i believe god gave me
[20:28] something to say and i'm going to fight
[20:30] every devil in hell why because i'm
[20:31] going to say what god gave me to say i'm
[20:34] not i'm not backing up i'm not stopping
[20:36] because i'm going to give everything i
[20:38] got why because god gave me everything
[20:40] that he had i'm going to give him
[20:41] everything i've got and
[20:43] y'all may have to carry me out of this
[20:45] building tonight but i still believe i'm
[20:46] going to give him everything i got and
[20:48] i'm gonna fight him all the way and
[20:49] because you know what i'm not gonna give
[20:51] up i'm not gonna quit
[20:53] why because he didn't quit on me because
[20:54] he's given me a way to overcome
[21:01] i'm so thankful why because we've got
[21:02] one that's mindful of us so where we are
[21:04] or what we're facing
[21:09] praise god god knows where you're at and
[21:11] he knows what you're facing he knows
[21:13] what you're going through
[21:16] see even and sometimes we look at things
[21:18] and we see things in in life and we see
[21:20] things and we don't understand why
[21:22] things happen the way they do and you
[21:24] and you start to look at people and one
[21:26] of the problems that people have is that
[21:27] they'll get things on their mind and
[21:29] they start to look at people and they
[21:30] say well this person is not at a certain
[21:33] level or this person is not where they
[21:34] ought to be well you know what god is
[21:36] mindful of them too
[21:38] and sometimes we get in our mind that we
[21:40] that we are that we almost you know we
[21:43] get on our on our pedestal sometimes and
[21:45] think we're better than other people and
[21:47] it's like well i don't i don't try to be
[21:48] like it well you know what the devil
[21:49] puts that in your mind
[21:52] the devil battles you you know what i
[21:54] don't care how holy you are how
[21:56] righteous you are how christian you are
[21:57] you know what you still fight them
[21:59] the thoughts the devil still will tell
[22:01] you and put that thing in you and just
[22:02] like brother branham you know as great
[22:04] as brother brandon was he still fought
[22:06] complexes he still fought things that he
[22:08] had to go through every single day and
[22:10] he had to stay say and repent and pray
[22:13] through
[22:16] he didn't change who he was but you know
[22:17] why because we're all we're all human
[22:19] we're all we're all fighting battles
[22:21] we're all failures
[22:27] i mean if we just if we just looked at
[22:28] our faults and failures
[22:30] and all all our problems you know we
[22:33] you know we could we could just sit
[22:34] around like
[22:37] like they used to do on hee haw you know
[22:38] we just say gloom despair and agony
[22:41] on me
[22:43] you know we could just sing that all day
[22:44] long gloom despair and agony on me
[22:49] deep dark depression excessive misery oh
[22:54] if it weren't for a bad luck i'd have no
[22:56] luck at all
[23:00] no no
[23:02] how does that how does that encourage
[23:03] face how does that increase your faith
[23:05] at all
[23:07] how does how does i do anything for
[23:09] anybody
[23:12] but people but people they'll get on and
[23:14] now it's the worst whatever whatever the
[23:16] worst thing is man they get on that and
[23:17] that's all they ride that horse till the
[23:19] end
[23:22] and you walk into work and you know
[23:23] you're just like you want to put your
[23:24] earplugs in and you and you can't put
[23:26] enough earplugs in your ears they don't
[23:28] sell them up well enough
[23:29] but some people you know you see them
[23:31] coming and you don't want to get near
[23:32] them
[23:36] why because why because they ain't got
[23:37] nothing they got nothing positive to say
[23:39] they got nothing encouraging to say and
[23:41] you know some people you get around and
[23:42] they'll just suck the life right out of
[23:44] you
[23:46] but you know what god has given us
[23:48] something that's to over to encourage us
[23:50] to strengthen us to increase our faith
[23:54] that when we come up you know i know you
[23:56] know whatever comes my way praise god i
[23:58] i was thinking about i listened to part
[24:00] of brother donnie's sermon last night
[24:03] and and north carolina and you know and
[24:05] there's brother brother ron sitting up
[24:07] there behind him and you know they you
[24:09] get brother ron's getting all excited
[24:10] and clapping and it's like well you know
[24:12] that man's and a lot of people they
[24:14] would look at that and say you know
[24:15] you're dying
[24:17] stage four cancers like you know but you
[24:19] know what he's not he's he's enjoying
[24:21] his self he's enjoying himself in the
[24:23] word why because he knows who he is and
[24:26] he knows what god you know you can only
[24:27] do so much and after that you got to put
[24:29] it in god's hands
[24:30] you know in the message letting off the
[24:32] pressure brother random meets that woman
[24:34] and he was she was so young looking
[24:37] that that when she was so young looking
[24:39] that she had grown children he was
[24:41] amazed at how young she looked
[24:44] and and she told her brother branham she
[24:45] said i realize when i become a christian
[24:47] you know i put all my cares on him
[24:49] because i couldn't deal with him and
[24:51] said if he can't take care of him i
[24:52] surely can't take care of him so you
[24:54] know what there's no need of both of us
[24:55] carrying them there's no need of both of
[24:57] us worrying about him because he told me
[24:59] to roll him on him so if i'm rolling it
[25:02] up on him then you know what it's not my
[25:03] job to take care of him anymore why
[25:05] because he said that he would do that
[25:07] and when she laid it on him then you
[25:08] know then when he done that then she was
[25:11] able to have all that free that freedom
[25:14] because she was in christ and she knew
[25:16] what god had done for her and she took
[25:18] him at his word
[25:20] just like that man was talking about you
[25:22] know it talks about the oil of joyful
[25:24] morning and and
[25:26] there in uh
[25:28] i believe that's uh
[25:29] isaiah
[25:31] but uh you know this talks about um put
[25:34] on the garment of praise for the spirit
[25:36] of heaviness
[25:38] and said you know to put on the be all
[25:40] of joy for mourning
[25:43] that man there was a man years ago he
[25:45] was talking about you know he said he
[25:46] said that's better that's better than
[25:47] ever any olive olay or max factor or any
[25:51] kind of other thing that you are if you
[25:52] ever get the oil of joy if you'll ever
[25:54] get anointed with the joy of the lord
[25:56] said that that'll better that's better
[25:58] than any medicine that god than any man
[26:01] has ever come up with if you can just
[26:02] get in the oil of joy and and take on
[26:05] that because he said it's joy
[26:06] unspeakable and full of glory if you can
[26:09] ever get into that then you know what
[26:10] it's beyond anything that man will ever
[26:12] come up with any kind of pill or any
[26:14] kind of everything because you know
[26:16] people today they're all the time trying
[26:18] to find the next high they're trying to
[26:19] find the next excitement they're trying
[26:21] to find something that's going to fill
[26:22] that void but you know they they reach
[26:24] that plateau at one point but they never
[26:27] can reach the excitement that they
[26:28] reached before
[26:30] but let me tell you something brothers
[26:32] and sisters this right here you can't
[26:34] you just continue to grow the more the
[26:36] lord opens things up and the more you
[26:37] grow in christ and the more god shows
[26:39] you and you reach a higher place then
[26:42] you know what it's better than it was
[26:43] before
[26:45] every day with jesus is sweeter than the
[26:47] day before because if you ever get to
[26:49] the place where it's not as exciting if
[26:51] it's not as a blessing to you as it was
[26:53] before if it's not as sweet if it's not
[26:55] just life-changing as it was before that
[26:57] it's time to come back to the altar
[26:59] because we've left god but you know if
[27:01] you're still walking with god it's
[27:03] greater and greater the trials may be
[27:05] harder it may it may be tougher you know
[27:08] but you know what it's greater because
[27:09] it's sweeter because the more you
[27:11] overcome the greater you see that god
[27:13] has brought you through what god has
[27:15] brought you to and now we see who god is
[27:17] in our lives and we can praise god
[27:19] there's many people that want to you
[27:21] know they they trying to
[27:23] worship god and but you know you you
[27:25] begin to look and and realize what god
[27:27] has done for you when you begin to look
[27:29] into the into the treasure chest that
[27:31] god has for us when we begin to look
[27:33] what god has done for us what god has in
[27:35] store for us he said you know he said we
[27:38] can we can't even comprehend these
[27:40] things eyes not seen nor ear heard nor
[27:42] has it entered into the heart of man
[27:44] what god has in store for him so when we
[27:46] become we begin to feed on these things
[27:48] and realize what god is you know we
[27:50] can't even put wrap our mind around what
[27:52] god how because how can you
[27:54] explain how can you understand an
[27:56] inexhaustible fountain of life of
[27:59] everlasting life but you know what we
[28:01] have the opportunity to come and drink
[28:03] and drink and drink and he's and he's
[28:05] been us to come
[28:08] and so we come would drink drink of this
[28:11] this fountain
[28:14] just like that little fish that brother
[28:15] ram talked about there you know you know
[28:17] out there in the ocean wondering you
[28:18] know well i better drink sparingly no
[28:21] don't drink sparingly
[28:23] you need to drink all that you can drink
[28:25] you need to get all that you can why
[28:27] because there's more than you than you
[28:29] realize because the more you take the
[28:30] more god has for you and the more you
[28:32] take the more god has for you and you
[28:35] begin to see as you begin to drink he
[28:37] said then you begin to drink and all of
[28:38] a sudden you begin to push out why
[28:40] because there's something on the inside
[28:42] because he said he said from the inside
[28:44] from the inner man he said there would
[28:46] be a river of flowing of life that's
[28:48] going to come out there's a wellspring
[28:50] that's going to come up so the more you
[28:52] take in the more it's going to come out
[28:54] then if it comes and you begin to
[28:55] manifest it to everybody everybody
[28:57] begins to see who you are that you have
[29:00] received this
[29:02] what a wonderful thing that what god has
[29:04] done for us that we can see what god has
[29:06] done for us
[29:07] god has blessed us and given us these
[29:09] things well we got to do is just
[29:11] continue to drink from it
[29:13] to realize that this whale is there for
[29:16] us
[29:21] now
[29:24] i want to
[29:27] look here in the
[29:29] in the scripture
[29:31] and look at the life of abraham and
[29:33] and um
[29:35] you know and abraham's life and
[29:38] here here's abraham and we know that
[29:40] abraham was given a promise an old man
[29:45] and all the things that he had been
[29:46] through in his life and but you know god
[29:48] made a promise to him that he was going
[29:50] to have children that he said he said
[29:52] can you count the stars in the heavens
[29:55] and he said no he said well that's the
[29:56] way your seed's going to be he said can
[29:58] you count the sand of the sea and he
[30:00] said no he said well that's the way your
[30:02] seed's going to be well you know as as
[30:04] god began to speak to abraham and he
[30:06] began to walk in that word well you know
[30:09] every single day after walking all those
[30:11] years and living with with sarah and
[30:14] never having any children but you know
[30:15] god began to speak to him and he began
[30:17] to walk in that and you know every day
[30:19] he got older
[30:21] and all and his his circumstances never
[30:24] changed he was continually walking as an
[30:27] old man and no no doubt he woke up and
[30:29] he had more aches and pains and he had
[30:31] he was slower to get up in the morning
[30:33] and he probably couldn't remember as
[30:34] well as he did the day before but you
[30:36] know what he still had the promise that
[30:38] he was going to be the father of nations
[30:40] and he began to walk in that and began
[30:42] to walk in there well you know he had
[30:44] all kinds of different problems that you
[30:45] know he gave away his wife and the
[30:47] different things that happened to him
[30:48] but you know what it never changed who
[30:50] he was it never changed the promise that
[30:52] he had he began to walk in that and as
[30:55] he began to walk and he began to see
[30:57] these things but then you know
[30:59] as he began to walk and he began to
[31:02] meditate on this word and sarah began to
[31:05] meditate on what god had promised them
[31:07] because she was in the promise also so
[31:09] that it was going to be both of them
[31:11] together it was going to bring forth
[31:12] this son and you know and then
[31:15] and we know in time you know they began
[31:17] to get a little bit uh
[31:20] a little bit weary about things
[31:22] they began to get things
[31:25] they tried to figure things out on their
[31:26] own
[31:27] you know they got to a place where they
[31:28] wanted to figure these things out and
[31:30] you know they thought well you know what
[31:31] god gives us these problems these
[31:33] promises but you know what i think we
[31:35] can help him out
[31:36] we've got a way that we can do this and
[31:38] we're going to we're going to help the
[31:40] lord out because i think there's a way
[31:41] that this will take place but you know
[31:43] god told abraham and sarah he said but
[31:46] you
[31:47] through sarah he told abraham through
[31:50] sarah with us the promised seed come the
[31:52] promised son's going to come y'all two
[31:54] will have a child but you know sarah and
[31:57] them you know they begin to look at
[31:59] these things it's like well i don't know
[32:01] how this is going to take place but i
[32:02] see well you know here's a way
[32:05] and and all of a sudden you know
[32:06] somebody comes up with this bright idea
[32:08] say hey you know god needs help to do is
[32:10] do his work
[32:12] to bring forth his promises so here's
[32:14] here's a young lady by the name of hagar
[32:16] and you know we're gonna and and sarah
[32:19] says well abraham you just take hagar
[32:22] and then you can bring forth a child
[32:25] well it was it was it was great for a
[32:27] while but the problem was is when when
[32:30] the lord spoke to him and you know you
[32:31] take this take her and you have a child
[32:34] but the problem is is it never brings
[32:36] forth the promise and all it does is
[32:39] bring problems it doesn't bring any
[32:40] promises
[32:42] now now we know in the scripture we know
[32:45] we know in the scripture because when
[32:47] when abraham takes hagar then when this
[32:50] when this takes place then all of a
[32:51] sudden we realize that hagar begins to
[32:53] hate
[32:54] sarah and then all of a sudden we see
[32:56] this we see this rift that's going on we
[32:58] see we see this uh tension that takes
[33:01] place in between these two and we see
[33:03] that because of this way that sarah
[33:05] treated hagar she left she ran away
[33:09] and here she is out in the out in the
[33:11] desert running from her her master and
[33:14] her mistress running away trying to
[33:16] escape this but you know what in the
[33:18] midst of all this is she runs runs away
[33:20] and she's trying to hide in the midst of
[33:22] this now listen to this in the midst of
[33:24] all this there becomes an angel of god
[33:27] unto hagar and speaks to her and wants
[33:29] to know where she's at why are you there
[33:33] why have you run away
[33:35] and begins to speak to her and tell her
[33:37] said you're with child you bring forth a
[33:39] son
[33:40] and you know what because he was the
[33:42] seed of abraham the scripture says
[33:44] because he was the seed of abraham that
[33:46] god was going to bless him
[33:48] he was to break he was to be blessed but
[33:50] the scripture also tells us that because
[33:53] he was a wild man that he would bring
[33:55] that every man's hand would be against
[33:57] him and his hand would be against every
[33:58] man why because it was brought forth by
[34:01] the flesh because he was because he was
[34:03] born of the bonds woman and not because
[34:06] of the promise and any time you try to
[34:08] bring forth the promise try to fulfill
[34:11] it and step in into the into the avenue
[34:13] of god and try to god doesn't need your
[34:16] help god needs you to follow his his
[34:19] plan not try to figure it out on your
[34:21] own not think you're going to help
[34:22] because anytime you think you're going
[34:23] to try to help god you're making a mess
[34:26] and so we say that in the midst of all
[34:28] this here she is out hey
[34:30] hagar is out in the desert and she's out
[34:32] by here by herself and the angel lord
[34:35] begins to speak to her and tell her that
[34:36] you need to go back but you'll have
[34:38] you'll bring forth a son and he'll be
[34:40] blessed
[34:41] but he says as he begins to speak to her
[34:44] there in in the in the valley there he
[34:46] begins to speak to her and brother brown
[34:48] mentions three times he talks about this
[34:50] place and it's called bear uh
[34:54] vera lo
[34:56] berlaho
[34:57] roy
[34:59] and it means
[35:01] the uh
[35:02] the well of him that liveth
[35:05] and seeth me
[35:09] so
[35:10] brother brandon mentions this twice
[35:11] there's three times he refers to this
[35:13] whale that she was at
[35:15] but she went to this whale and he begins
[35:17] to tell her what's going to take place
[35:18] for you to go back
[35:20] you go back to abraham you go back to
[35:23] sarah and you're going to bring forth
[35:24] this son now he brings forth she brings
[35:26] forth ishmael
[35:29] and abraham is so
[35:30] joyed that he's that he's got a son
[35:35] you know what because god had god had to
[35:36] do something in his life for him to have
[35:38] children
[35:40] and it's brought forth something
[35:42] but you know what it's not the it's not
[35:43] the promised seed it's not the promised
[35:46] son but he's brought forth his son and
[35:48] and abraham after god's tried to talk to
[35:50] him and tell him what's going to take
[35:51] place oh that ishmael will live before
[35:54] you
[35:55] but you know what there's no place that
[35:58] ishmael is going to live before god why
[36:00] because he's not going to follow that
[36:02] because he's not of the right lineage
[36:03] he's not in the right seat
[36:08] because because he's he's out of that
[36:10] one
[36:12] and let me tell you something brother
[36:13] sisters if we try to do things after the
[36:16] flesh
[36:17] if we try to live after the flesh you
[36:19] know we try we try to we try to uh do
[36:21] the things by the flesh you know we we
[36:23] try to live right we try to do all these
[36:24] things if it's not the holy ghost on the
[36:27] inside living the life he said it's all
[36:29] worthless
[36:31] it's only filthy rags there's there's no
[36:33] righteousness in it at all there's
[36:35] there's no glorifying god in any of it
[36:38] but when when here when ishmael comes
[36:41] forth and and abraham was you know
[36:43] looking at his son
[36:45] but in the in the midst of all this when
[36:48] all the when all of this goes on and
[36:50] he's so wrapped up and god's telling him
[36:53] listen
[36:55] that is not the promised son
[36:58] that's not the promise that i brought
[37:00] you to
[37:02] but he's so focused on ishmael
[37:06] now i want you to understand when he
[37:07] when he becomes so focused on this what
[37:10] what it came of the flesh
[37:13] and many times people people get so
[37:15] wrapped up they want to live so right
[37:17] and they want to live so religious but
[37:18] the problem is it's not the holy ghost
[37:21] we're living after the flesh
[37:24] and you know we we want to live just
[37:26] just so right but the problem is is are
[37:28] we letting the holy ghost do it
[37:31] so when
[37:33] when ishmael
[37:35] grows up
[37:38] we know that god didn't forget his
[37:39] promise
[37:41] to sarah
[37:43] and we know that in time sarah brings
[37:45] forth a son
[37:47] which is the promised
[37:49] it brings forth isaac and then when
[37:51] isaac is weaned from his mother
[37:54] then we realize that ishmael
[37:56] begins to mock
[37:58] isaac
[37:59] because of who he was
[38:02] why because the flesh man is always
[38:04] going to war against the seed
[38:07] the inner man
[38:08] the promised sun that comes forth
[38:10] and so what when when the promised son
[38:12] because the promised son is is the new
[38:15] birth is the new man because the old
[38:17] man's got to go
[38:19] so what happened is because of the
[38:21] warring that takes place between the two
[38:24] because of the tension then ishmael has
[38:26] to be cast out
[38:28] and what and so when sarah comes and
[38:31] tells abraham said you need to cast out
[38:33] the bondwoman and her son then the lord
[38:35] speaks to abraham and says hearken under
[38:38] the voice of sarah because she knows
[38:40] that you've got to separate these two
[38:42] there's got to be a total separation
[38:44] from these two but you know what when
[38:47] when asheville is cast out when when
[38:50] hagar is past is cast out and and he
[38:53] gives them provision and sends them out
[38:55] and she goes out into the desert
[38:57] and we know in time because there's
[38:59] because she has no more than just these
[39:01] their provisions we cut we know that
[39:03] hagar comes to a place that she's about
[39:05] ready to die and ishmael is too
[39:08] they're out in the desert there's no
[39:09] water there's no food there's no nothing
[39:11] she's in dire straits but let me tell
[39:14] you something in the midst of that dire
[39:16] straits and the condition that she was
[39:18] in and she laid out there and she took
[39:20] the baby and she carried him off the
[39:21] scripture said she carried him a bow
[39:23] shot off from her and she said i don't
[39:25] want to hear him die i don't want to see
[39:26] him die she herald she hauled him off
[39:28] and left him and then she came back and
[39:30] she began to pray to god and god began
[39:32] to speak to her
[39:34] you know what
[39:35] when he began to speak to her the angel
[39:37] lord spoke to hagar and said where are
[39:39] you
[39:40] why are you in this condition what's
[39:42] going on began to speak to her but when
[39:44] he began to speak to her and tell her
[39:47] he began to speak to her and then he
[39:48] tells her to look
[39:50] he opens up her vision and she sees a
[39:52] well in the distance and there's a well
[39:55] that she goes to to draw water
[39:58] and she takes the cruise and she goes in
[40:00] the distance to get water and she brings
[40:02] it back to ishmael to give him water do
[40:04] you know what the name of that well is
[40:12] the place that she came to to receive
[40:14] that promise that she was that fulfilled
[40:16] that promise when she came to the place
[40:19] that she was about ready to die god had
[40:21] brought her back and gave her a vision
[40:23] and took her right back to the same
[40:24] place where she was that he had
[40:26] fulfilled that promise why because the
[40:28] promise had been made to her that
[40:30] wherever she was at she was going to
[40:31] bring forth that he was going to bring
[40:33] forth a great nation that his seed would
[40:35] be innumerable but when she got what she
[40:38] got into this place and when he did the
[40:40] scripture says god said i've heard the
[40:42] voice of the lad crying
[40:45] let me tell you something brothers and
[40:46] sisters if i don't stir your soul your
[40:48] spoons fell out of your bowl how in the
[40:50] world could a son that's that's of this
[40:53] of the of the flesh that's that's not of
[40:56] the promise and yet god kept his promise
[40:58] to him in the midst of all the problems
[41:01] that he went through where he was into
[41:02] just about ready to die and god had made
[41:04] provisions for him and showed hagar to
[41:07] go right back to the same place that she
[41:09] was when when she was given the promise
[41:12] and brothers and sisters that's the same
[41:13] way with us when we get into hardships
[41:15] and problems what does god do he sends
[41:17] us right back to the same well where he
[41:20] drew us at where he drew before he
[41:21] brought us back to the same place why
[41:23] because when we get away from god what
[41:25] is god doing he's pointing you right
[41:26] back to the same place where you came
[41:29] from he's pointing you back to go back
[41:31] to there
[41:32] well because that's where god's
[41:33] blessings are that's where god's
[41:35] promises are fulfilled in that same
[41:37] place and he sent hagar back to the same
[41:40] place where that where she was before
[41:42] and he gave her water to bring forth the
[41:44] sun
[41:48] man i tell you what if i if i don't
[41:51] three i don't know what does but why
[41:53] because if you see even god is mindful
[41:55] of the sparrows and even even of all
[41:58] people oh
[41:59] the world people and you know and
[42:01] wherever they at how much more is the
[42:03] son of god the ones that are of the seed
[42:05] of abraham how about the more the more
[42:07] the ones that are the called the one the
[42:10] ones that are predestinated to this the
[42:12] one that this has come to if that don't
[42:14] if you don't see if he if he's mindful
[42:16] of them how much more is he mindful of
[42:18] you that he's going to meet your needs
[42:24] hallelujah
[42:27] whoo
[42:28] i could run around the building on that
[42:30] why because you know if god if god is
[42:32] mindful of them how much more is he
[42:34] mindful of me
[42:37] and we look and we look out there and we
[42:39] see we see the world and the condition
[42:41] that people are living in and all these
[42:43] type things but you know what god your
[42:44] heavenly father is mindful of you
[42:48] he knows what you have need of all these
[42:50] things but you know he will bring you to
[42:51] that place
[42:54] what a wonder what a wonderful thing
[42:55] because you know
[42:57] we think well
[42:58] all these people have houses and they
[43:00] have lands and they have all these
[43:01] things
[43:04] you know but but god knows you don't
[43:06] need that
[43:08] i mean i mean people you know the last
[43:10] the last few days and man they're like
[43:12] have you bought your lottery ticket yet
[43:14] have you bought your lottery ticket chin
[43:18] one billion dollars with a bail billion
[43:20] dollars
[43:21] what are you going to do with it
[43:25] what are you going to do with it you
[43:26] can't get out of hell with it
[43:30] you can you can steve jobs one of the
[43:32] richest men in the world and he still
[43:34] died
[43:36] he was sick for cancer for the longest
[43:38] time done all kinds of treatment they've
[43:39] done everything they could for me and
[43:40] you know he still died
[43:43] what is what is it what does it profit
[43:45] you jesus said if you gain the whole
[43:47] world and lose your own soul what what
[43:49] have you gained
[43:51] if you've gained if you gain the whole
[43:52] world a billion dollars
[43:55] well i mean you you probably get half of
[43:57] it after taxes
[43:59] but what are you going to do
[44:01] people people can't can't they can't
[44:03] live on what they got right now and the
[44:04] problem is as brother dave ramsey tells
[44:06] us you know it doesn't change who you
[44:09] are it just magnifies your character
[44:13] so if you can't if you can't manage the
[44:15] money you got now how are you going to
[44:16] manage more money
[44:19] there's people there's people that's
[44:21] made millions and millions of dollars
[44:23] you look at sports figures and and all
[44:25] these people that's made just loads of
[44:28] loads of money and you know and as soon
[44:30] as they get finished some of them as
[44:31] soon as they get finished playing sports
[44:34] they're broke
[44:37] well because they they've not made one
[44:39] preparation of what's going to take
[44:41] place 10 years down the road
[44:43] five years down the road 20 years down
[44:45] the road what are you going to do when
[44:47] you can't play football anymore what are
[44:49] you going to do when you can't when you
[44:50] can't do these things anymore
[44:53] but you know they say we're just we're
[44:55] just living in the moment
[44:58] we're just you know because we we've got
[44:59] we've got to live better than the next
[45:01] person we got we got to keep our name in
[45:03] the in the newspaper we got to keep our
[45:04] name in social media we got to keep
[45:06] putting our name out there so everybody
[45:08] looks at us
[45:10] well you know the thing is is you know
[45:12] the
[45:13] people people that live like that you
[45:14] know they do end up in social media
[45:16] again it's like what happened to so such
[45:21] what happened to this person they made
[45:24] 50 million dollars in their lifetime
[45:28] and now they've got a job at walmart
[45:33] you know so what what good has it done
[45:35] you
[45:37] but you know you try to talk to people
[45:39] about
[45:41] what are you going to do
[45:42] when this life is over with
[45:45] what are you going to do when this is
[45:46] when this is all over with when you die
[45:48] what are you going to do then
[45:49] where are you going to go what what's
[45:51] your plans
[45:54] what have you laid up in store what has
[45:56] what has what has captured your vision
[45:58] of what's going to take place in the
[45:59] future
[46:02] brother branham said in the message
[46:03] remembering the lord he said now we
[46:05] could go on and on with characters
[46:07] talking about the people in the bible he
[46:08] said but let's just
[46:10] let's just think this he said don't miss
[46:13] seeing your whale
[46:15] now
[46:16] don't miss seeing the spot of
[46:18] refreshment that brings life
[46:22] so we got to find the place because we
[46:24] can we can see a lot of other things
[46:25] that can capture our mind capture our
[46:27] vision take our time
[46:29] but if it but if it doesn't have any
[46:31] eternal value to it what a good is it
[46:34] many people many people are chasing many
[46:37] things and it's and it's a great thing
[46:38] it's honorable
[46:40] but you know if you if you decide that
[46:42] you want to be a doctor and you're going
[46:44] to and that's and that's an admirable
[46:47] profession and that's a great thing but
[46:49] you know what if you don't spend as much
[46:50] time chasing god and seeking god's faith
[46:53] as you do trying to trying to understand
[46:55] the anatomy of the human body then you
[46:57] know what you've not gained anything
[47:01] and you know people have spent their
[47:02] lifetime trying to brother randall was
[47:04] talking about that man who spent all of
[47:06] his time trying to study bones and
[47:07] everything he was talking about the
[47:09] bones being 14 million years old and was
[47:12] trying to figure out how old they are
[47:13] and explain all this stuff and he said
[47:15] he's wasted his life why because he said
[47:17] he can't look and just look and pick up
[47:19] the scripture and look into the
[47:20] scripture and take what god said and lo
[47:23] and show that what god said and he said
[47:25] because all of the all of that petrified
[47:27] bone and stuff is not con it's contrary
[47:29] to the scripture
[47:31] and he spent all of his time trying to
[47:33] prove something that's so so many
[47:35] million years old and he's wasted his
[47:37] time
[47:39] how many times people people are out
[47:40] trying to chase something that you know
[47:42] i want to be the the next one that this
[47:44] the next one at that
[47:47] you know that it does what good is it if
[47:50] you've got your name on on youtube
[47:52] what does it matter if you've got your
[47:54] name in the guinness book of world
[47:55] records well i mean what but if you
[47:57] don't have if you don't have your name
[47:59] in the lamb's book of life it doesn't
[48:00] matter there is no other place that your
[48:03] name needs to show up i could care less
[48:06] if anybody knows my name but i do want
[48:08] to know one thing i want people to see
[48:09] that they see jesus christ in me
[48:11] that they can see jesus christ if they
[48:13] can see jesus christ of me that's what i
[48:15] want
[48:17] not not trying to
[48:20] buy the world and
[48:22] and move all these things because
[48:24] there's no there's nothing there
[48:33] and many people
[48:35] many people have had had this
[48:37] opportunity
[48:38] that's coming in contact with this whale
[48:42] that he stood in there in their midst
[48:49] brother brown talks about
[48:51] were they
[48:53] you know people handled him
[48:55] speaking of jesus he walked in their
[48:57] midst they handled him they touched him
[49:01] began to hear him speak
[49:04] what a wonderful thing that was
[49:07] but there's two men that brother ram
[49:09] talk about
[49:10] that that had that had a terrible time
[49:15] and they handled it wrong
[49:18] one was a man by the name of herod
[49:21] and and pilate was the other one and
[49:23] they they began to speak when when jesus
[49:25] was accused and brought before
[49:30] now
[49:30] herod herod had had the opportunity to
[49:33] have have a conference with him
[49:35] to have had an audience with him began
[49:37] to speak to him
[49:39] but you know he said he said the problem
[49:41] that
[49:42] herod had was that when he stood before
[49:43] jesus he never asked for mercy
[49:46] he never called upon his name he said
[49:48] the only thing that herod could do when
[49:50] he stood before jesus
[49:52] was have jesus entertain him
[49:56] we're going to we're going to put this
[49:57] crown of thorns on you we're gonna put
[49:58] the robe on you we're gonna cover up
[50:00] your head and hit you with a and pull
[50:01] your beard out we're gonna hit you in
[50:03] well if you're if you're if you're who
[50:04] you say you are tell us who hit you
[50:08] he was just he was just there for
[50:09] entertainment
[50:12] he said he said the problem that herod
[50:14] had was that he had 4 000 years of the
[50:18] prophets and the law
[50:20] that had laid before him
[50:22] and he had heard all those things
[50:25] and he said yet he turned it all down
[50:28] because he was more interested in
[50:30] entertainment
[50:32] and brother branham says
[50:34] we
[50:35] face a greater condemnation
[50:37] because he said it's been six thousand
[50:39] years of the word and we've heard what
[50:41] we've heard and what we have read and
[50:43] what all the things that god has done in
[50:45] 6 000 years and he said and people turn
[50:48] him down
[50:49] and he said it's a greater condemnation
[50:50] today than it was then
[50:54] he said pilate pilate had a had a great
[50:56] thing that he tried he tried to let
[50:58] jesus go
[51:00] and he could have
[51:03] but you know what he was more interested
[51:05] in what the people had to
[51:06] see he was more interested in what they
[51:09] had to say than what he knew what's
[51:11] truth
[51:13] but you know he come out there oh
[51:16] this just man
[51:18] don't you want me to release
[51:20] the son of the king of the jews
[51:22] no we don't want him we won't barabbas
[51:27] we want an insurrectionist we want a
[51:29] murderer
[51:31] we want this ruffian that's who we
[51:32] bumped
[51:34] this other man well we can't find any
[51:36] fault with him
[51:37] well we don't we still like him
[51:40] you can't find any any any faults with
[51:41] the word but we don't want it
[51:44] don't want to touch it no
[51:47] but what'd he do he walked out there
[51:57] i washed my hands of this
[52:00] but you know what there was there's not
[52:02] enough water in the world
[52:03] that was going to wash the blood of
[52:05] jesus off pilate's hands
[52:10] and you and i we can we can have the
[52:11] same thoughts we can have the same ideas
[52:14] that we think we're going to wash this
[52:15] off our hands but we're not
[52:18] he stepped well because when we've we've
[52:20] had him step in our in our pathway when
[52:22] we've had an audience with him
[52:25] and he's come our way and he spoke to us
[52:28] how much more condemnation
[52:31] for us
[52:33] for what we've heard
[52:36] that we that we have to face
[52:43] we need to
[52:46] take a more earnest heed to the things
[52:48] that we've heard
[52:52] because there's things that in our lives
[52:54] sometimes and
[52:55] and i've had the opportunity to
[52:58] the to have thing to witness things and
[53:03] and you see the condition that things
[53:05] that
[53:06] that things have happened
[53:09] and you you realize that that god sends
[53:11] people across our path and and they are
[53:14] witnesses to us
[53:17] and they are
[53:18] they are rebukes to us
[53:22] i was thinking the other day i was
[53:24] thinking about a there was a young lady
[53:26] that i was acquainted with years ago
[53:28] when
[53:29] she was several years younger than me
[53:30] and she had a she went she went to a
[53:33] message church her grandparents were in
[53:35] the message
[53:39] ever since she was been knee-high to a
[53:41] grasshopper all she's known is this
[53:42] message
[53:45] and you know she was she was all by
[53:47] herself and and she wanted she wanted a
[53:49] friend
[53:52] and she she wanted to have somebody that
[53:53] was her age that had
[53:56] the same
[53:57] likes that she did that you know had
[53:59] hobbies and different things with
[54:01] well the lord sent her a little little
[54:03] girl
[54:04] about the same mate she was about 11 12
[54:05] 13 maybe
[54:07] but this little girl comes along and
[54:10] this girl knew nothing about the
[54:11] scripture she'd never been to church
[54:13] really
[54:15] she lived with her mom and her
[54:16] grandmother
[54:18] but this little girl started coming to
[54:20] church with this girl
[54:23] and this look this little girl all
[54:25] she all she knew was brother branham she
[54:27] all she knew was this message
[54:30] but you know she brought this little
[54:31] girl come along her way
[54:33] this little little teenage girl
[54:38] and she becomes such a rebuke to that
[54:39] girl
[54:41] this young girl
[54:44] she began to come to church and you know
[54:45] what people didn't come to church and
[54:46] talk you can't cut your hair
[54:50] and you can't wear pants and you can't
[54:51] do this you can't do that
[54:54] this little girl come to church
[54:57] and they loved her
[55:00] and they witnessed to her
[55:03] but it's not the do's and don'ts
[55:07] but it's the manifestation of john 3 16.
[55:13] don't you don't you don't have to quote
[55:14] malachi 4 and all that kind of stuff
[55:16] john 3 16.
[55:19] there is a living savior
[55:21] who died for your sins
[55:24] and there is a fountain to cover your
[55:26] sins
[55:27] and for you to come into fellowship with
[55:29] him
[55:32] and this little girl she began she began
[55:35] to see things
[55:37] and it began to prick her heart
[55:41] and this little girl 12 13 years old
[55:44] fought with her grandmother and her mom
[55:46] because she wouldn't go get her hair cut
[55:50] but this other little girl you know
[55:53] she didn't cut her hair
[55:54] she had an accident with a curling iron
[56:04] but you see this little girl she didn't
[56:06] want to wear pants
[56:07] she didn't want to wear shorts
[56:09] but she had to fault her mom and her
[56:11] grandmother because you know what it
[56:12] become a rebuke to them
[56:16] but she had such a desire
[56:20] that when when this took place that her
[56:22] parent her mom and her grandmother
[56:23] refused to let her go to the church
[56:25] anymore
[56:28] because it was such a rebuke because she
[56:30] was so stirred
[56:33] to be such a young girl
[56:35] to make a stand
[56:38] and what a rebuke
[56:43] when you've walked in this all your life
[56:44] this is all you've ever known
[56:46] and you can't stand and make a
[56:48] profession
[56:49] when you can't stand
[56:50] and stand and
[56:54] show the world your true colors when you
[56:56] get some little girl to come off the
[56:58] street doesn't know split peas from
[57:00] coffee grounds about the bible
[57:02] but something stirred in her enough that
[57:04] she would stand
[57:06] and stand against her her
[57:08] her mom and her grandmother
[57:10] that she didn't want to have to do that
[57:15] and i thought
[57:16] what a rebuke
[57:18] but you know what god honor her faith
[57:23] and i just prayed that you know one of
[57:25] these days that maybe the lord crossed
[57:27] her path again
[57:30] this has been years ago i never i never
[57:31] knew what happened to her but i know
[57:33] where the other i know where the first
[57:34] girl is i see her on facebook
[57:38] and i see the life that she lives
[57:41] the pictures she posts
[57:44] and i think
[57:46] what happened
[57:47] when that girl crossed your path
[57:50] you wanted a friend god sent you
[57:51] somebody
[57:55] man it stir it stirs you when because
[57:58] that's what god has for us
[58:02] when we see today the condition that
[58:04] people are in the world is in
[58:07] god has somebody that's standing for the
[58:08] truth
[58:11] and you know it's it's hard to see
[58:14] things but you know what god has given
[58:16] us
[58:18] a way
[58:20] to draw closer to overcome these things
[58:25] when we're rebuked there's a place to
[58:26] come to
[58:30] i i think
[58:33] i i i saw something the other day that
[58:36] stirred me
[58:40] i saw i saw somebody post something on
[58:43] on social media
[58:47] and it and it made some comment about
[58:49] how they lived their life
[58:54] and then and it looked like in it and in
[58:55] the in the caption it looks like you
[58:58] know something that you scrape off your
[58:59] shoe
[59:02] and they said well that that's what i
[59:04] think of people's opinion
[59:06] of how i ought to live my life
[59:11] and what caught my attention was you
[59:12] know sometimes it's not an opinion
[59:16] you know what it's not it's not an
[59:18] opinion
[59:19] sometimes it's the word of god
[59:23] but you but you account the word of god
[59:25] as something you would scrape off your
[59:26] shoe
[59:28] it's so low that it's just like dunk
[59:30] that you would just scrape it off your
[59:31] shoe and it's it's like i i don't i
[59:33] don't want to have anything to do with
[59:34] it it's it's so it's so nasty i don't
[59:37] want to touch it
[59:40] but let me tell you something that is
[59:42] the word of god you got to be careful
[59:45] when you when you hear something and if
[59:47] it comes across this pulpit and you say
[59:49] well i don't like that well you better
[59:50] be careful what you say
[59:53] it is we have to be careful how we think
[59:55] about things why because it may not just
[59:58] be a minister standing up here it may
[1:00:00] not be brother wade's standing up here
[1:00:03] because if he's standing in the office
[1:00:05] that he's called to that it's not it's
[1:00:07] not him it's god
[1:00:11] one because those that have been given
[1:00:13] into position to stand over us and the
[1:00:15] same with brother dale in the position
[1:00:17] that they've been placed over us we're
[1:00:18] supposed the scripture says we're
[1:00:19] supposed to give them double honor
[1:00:22] their do double honor
[1:00:26] but sometimes we say well that's i said
[1:00:28] well no you got to be careful
[1:00:33] why because we can get in trouble
[1:00:37] because if we're not careful of how we
[1:00:39] handle situations
[1:00:42] even when it comes to our families
[1:00:48] why because
[1:00:51] even even
[1:00:52] the scripture i think about the
[1:00:53] scripture you know where it talks about
[1:00:55] you know we're supposed to honor one
[1:00:57] another and live together and and those
[1:00:59] things and and the scripture says you
[1:01:01] know husbands are supposed to honor
[1:01:03] their wives and said that their prayers
[1:01:04] not be hindered
[1:01:09] well you know and she's supposed to
[1:01:10] reverence her her husband well you know
[1:01:12] if we if we just pass things over and
[1:01:15] not and not try to actually look at
[1:01:17] things as we ought to
[1:01:21] then you know what we're dishonoring god
[1:01:24] and just as we come into this building
[1:01:26] this sanctuary and we gather in and then
[1:01:28] you know if we if because if we don't
[1:01:31] take it as in the seriousness that it's
[1:01:33] given in then you know what then our
[1:01:36] prayers are hindered
[1:01:38] that we have a problem we're hindering
[1:01:40] the service we're hindering the church
[1:01:44] and that's that's an important aspect to
[1:01:45] look at in our lives because when god
[1:01:47] begins to bring things out it's
[1:01:48] important for us to realize god's
[1:01:50] speaking to us
[1:01:53] brothers and sisters we're not not in
[1:01:55] not any of us are promised tomorrow
[1:01:58] we're not even promised tonight
[1:02:03] and when it comes to times that you have
[1:02:05] to check up with god and understand what
[1:02:07] god has called you to and put ourselves
[1:02:10] before god as the lord what we need what
[1:02:11] do we need to change
[1:02:14] i want to change i want to be what you
[1:02:15] want me to be
[1:02:22] i was i was thinking about where
[1:02:25] brother wade was speaking sunday and he
[1:02:26] was
[1:02:27] and i'm i'm gonna get on this
[1:02:30] i got off i'll get off my preaching box
[1:02:32] i'm gonna get on my meddling box now
[1:02:36] but you know
[1:02:38] one in the same i think sometimes
[1:02:40] but you know
[1:02:41] he was talking about women in their
[1:02:42] clothing
[1:02:46] and the and because you know what you
[1:02:48] don't have to witness to people
[1:02:52] your life is your witness
[1:02:55] so the why the life that we live is the
[1:02:57] witness to people
[1:02:59] and the way we handle situations and
[1:03:01] what we look like when we walk out that
[1:03:03] is the witness
[1:03:06] good or bad
[1:03:07] but that's a witness anyway so when we
[1:03:09] dress like the world and we act like the
[1:03:11] world and we do things of the world
[1:03:14] how do we how do we have a confession
[1:03:18] to witness that we're separated from the
[1:03:19] world when we when people are trying to
[1:03:22] figure out where exactly where the world
[1:03:23] ends and where christ begins
[1:03:28] when he's talking about women and their
[1:03:30] clothes and and different things and you
[1:03:31] know i would say
[1:03:33] brother branham said you know they said
[1:03:34] well brother brother branham said said
[1:03:36] that's the only kind of clothes they
[1:03:38] sail that's all they that's all they got
[1:03:40] around here's them clothes that that are
[1:03:42] just that you fuss about all the time he
[1:03:44] said sister they still so sowing
[1:03:45] machines and sell goods
[1:03:50] but brother branham said
[1:03:52] he said the but the problem that we have
[1:03:54] is that we have
[1:03:56] he said the problem is is people have
[1:03:57] given up on going to church
[1:04:01] and and forsaking the assembling of
[1:04:03] themselves together and when they do
[1:04:05] that then that becomes a problem because
[1:04:07] you know what it's just a it's just a
[1:04:10] symptom of a greater problem
[1:04:13] well because if you've not god if you've
[1:04:15] not got born again and you don't come to
[1:04:17] church and you don't read your bible and
[1:04:18] you don't pray and you don't study then
[1:04:20] you know what you're going to live like
[1:04:21] that
[1:04:23] and what caught my attention was i was
[1:04:26] looking at this thing and and on uh
[1:04:28] instagram
[1:04:30] i'm on instagram so
[1:04:32] yeah y'all pray for me
[1:04:36] but there's there's there's a thing a
[1:04:38] little
[1:04:39] a hashtag or whatever
[1:04:41] called message believers
[1:04:43] so anyway i was on there looking and you
[1:04:45] know what amazed me brother
[1:04:47] there's a whole bunch of pictures all
[1:04:49] these women who are message believers
[1:04:52] and you know they're all dressed modest
[1:04:58] and here's all these pictures of all
[1:04:59] these women
[1:05:02] and it's like wow look at look at this
[1:05:05] and then
[1:05:06] as i was scrolling over there there's
[1:05:08] other uh other uh hashtags or whatever
[1:05:11] that groups everything together and it
[1:05:13] was another group and it's all these
[1:05:14] women and they're apostolic
[1:05:18] i don't know if any of y'all have ever
[1:05:19] seen any of that or not but you know
[1:05:20] what amazed me is here all these
[1:05:22] apostolic ladies and some of them are
[1:05:23] all i know about women from all around
[1:05:25] the world
[1:05:26] and this one woman she's in a foreign
[1:05:28] language i think she's portuguese
[1:05:30] portuguese but i think probably brazil
[1:05:31] or someplace but anyway she her i had to
[1:05:33] translate her uh heading when i was
[1:05:36] looking at it and she said
[1:05:37] she wanted women to dress elegant but
[1:05:40] not to give up their principles
[1:05:45] and she had all of these dresses and
[1:05:47] skirts and all these things and she was
[1:05:49] showing all the things that she had and
[1:05:50] i was like well here's a testimony
[1:05:55] but you know but some people you know
[1:05:57] we gotta we gotta it's gotta be like
[1:05:59] this or that no here's pictures
[1:06:02] now now when you go through and er i
[1:06:04] know people spend a lot of time on
[1:06:05] social media and scrolling everything
[1:06:07] they got to read all the and play all
[1:06:09] their farm games and and all that kind
[1:06:10] of stuff you know but you know if you
[1:06:12] ever get a chance and you got to stop
[1:06:13] for a minute won't you go on there and
[1:06:15] look and you can find all these women
[1:06:18] that know how to dress properly
[1:06:22] it was amazing
[1:06:24] no i know i'm i'm meddling again but
[1:06:26] that's all right brother

[1:06:38] i whatever
[1:06:39] i'm here

[1:06:44] but it's
[1:06:45] it's still the truth
[1:06:48] we need to take we need to take a more
[1:06:49] earnest heed to what we've heard and
[1:06:51] what we've seen
[1:06:55] that we need to see what god has for us

[1:07:06] honored by what we do what we say

[1:07:14] but god god is what's most important
[1:07:18] amen and so i want you to tonight
