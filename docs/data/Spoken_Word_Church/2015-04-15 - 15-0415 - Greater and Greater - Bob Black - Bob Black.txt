chapter 21 verse 19 and also 1 Peter chapter 2 veres 1- 2 set up thank you I I just count it such a great privilege to get to speak to y'all CU I what I've been kind of meditating on um you know as as brother Dale kind of mentioned last Sunday that we we got a little opportunity to go to speak to some brothers from Guatemala down in Mobile last time and um I told Brother Matthew I was just tagging along the support but he he got all the ministers up there to say a few remarks and and um what I shared with them I I I want to share with you tonight but I you know I when when I look I I I read about how brother Brandon would in his early Ministry he would take a picture of the congregation and he said I take this picture and I go and pray for you and you know you just looking out you see people from all different walks of life that have come together and and from all different scenarios and things and and I wonder if we realize what a great group of people because of what has God God has done for us y'all bear with me a second when I when I get fool I get leaky but let's uh before we go get into the word let's just go to the Lord in prayer real quick Lord Jesus we just thank you God for your grace and mercy to us thank you God for the hour that we live in for the word that you've given to us Lord and I pray God that you will be with us tonight Lord because Lord we haven't come together to fellowship with one another to see me or or those things but we come to fellowship with you to Fellowship around your word to hear from you Lord Jesus and I pray oh God that you'll Lord this time that we've come come together from Far places Lord Jesus that this time won't be wasted Lord that you'll open our eyes to see more of you and see more of our position in you Lord Jesus and where we've come from and what you've done for us Lord grant it you'll bless everyone here Lord Jesus we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I came prepared Matthew 21: 19 and when he saw a fig tree in the way he came to it and found nothing their own but leaves only and said unto it let no let no fruit grow on thee henceforward forever and presently the Fig Tree withered away in 1 Peter chapter 2 verses 1- 2 wherefore laying aside all malice and all G and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings as newborn babies desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby you may be seated the Lord out his Blessing to the reading of the word now down there in in that little Guam Bon group they were we just had a wonderful time of Fellowship they they were so humble and um and you know that is a little group that had came from from the ends of the Earth really and they many of them came to America and and then discovered the message after they came and we talked to one brother that had walked all the way to the United States from Guatemala they got on trains and different things but he came that way you know not not by plane or anything and they ended up um you know maybe maybe tonight many of us are tired and weary but you know we all got together at midnight and that's when Church started because of the of the situation down there but just remember that little group in prayer when you think about it but I wondered when I when I was speaking to them I I the Lord just kind of laid it on my heart this little scripture wherefore laying aside all malice and all G and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby because first of all we've got to lay aside everything every weight of this world that so easily possess us just like Abel when he came and brought his offering he he didn't just lay his offering on this altar but he laid himself up there as well and that's how we do we've got to lay every everything down everything y'all bear with me Hallelujah lay aside all malice and all G and oces and envies and all evil speakings all hypocrisies you know when when Jesus looked and he saw Nathaniel coming he said behold here is the Israelite and whom is no G somebody that there's nothing nothing in this man that that's contrary he just he's he's what you see is what you get and that's the kind of person that that that can do something with God can do something with you lay aside all malice and all G and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings I was telling some of the brothers that this week at work I went through the kind of the review process and and I I kind of started thinking what isn't it a paradox that in the just the natural not even talking about the stature of perfect man or anything but in the natural you can have a grown man that act still acts like a child or a grown woman that still acts like a child and what a strange thing that is now spiritually speaking God doesn't want us to be babies he wants us to grow up into maturity so that we can we'll know what we're talking about so we know what what who he is and who we are so we know God's plan for us amen and the way that we grow is is starting off by the sincere milk of the word and we grow up and we eat and and take in God's word and until we're eating steak until we're coming to a place where we're like like Jeremiah and David said like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water where it's roots go down anchor deep into the earth into the into the word of into God's word and when we grow up straight and strong and knowing like like brother Bram said that what we should be is giants in the gospel we shouldn't just be adults we should be Giants and and he you know to to my shame we we I should know more about the message I should know more about the Bible we should all know more than because we should think about where where we are today and what's going on in the world and and and do you know what I'm what I'm kind of thinking on is do we know who we are that's it so over in Matthew let me stay on hold on let me stay on First Peter a second more as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby and you just keep reading on down if so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious and we got a little bit on this in in the Sunday school class to whom coming is unto a living Stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious you also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded he shall not be confounded by who he is and and what's going on you you see many people look upon the bride of Christ today and and just see something maybe wrapped in Badger skin something something just common and and can't understand don't get a revelation of what's going on but we should be so thankful that we see we have the revelation of God's word for this day and see uh what he's given to us all right let me jump over to Matthew Matthew 21 19 and and and this is story is also told in Mark 11:13 when he saw a fig tree in the way he came to it and found nothing there on but leaves only and said unto it let no fruit grow on the hence Forward Forever and presently the Fig Tree withered away right you know here's a man that God is both God and man and he he came came he he's walking down the road and he gets hungry and he goes looking for food now this is the man that that took fishes and bread and pulled them apart in his hand and began to Dole them out to people and that creative act is what identified him when he was walking on the road to amas with the with the disciples that on that Resurrection morning what identified with him was when he went into the secret place and shut the door and they entered in with him and he did something that identified him he began to break the bread in the way that was known to them and then identified him them him and now now this man this God man that could speak and raise Lazarus from the grave he he walks up to this fig tree and such a strange story that even brother brandham said it it always kind of always had a question about it until the Lord answered uh his question what was going on with this fig tree how is it that he can speak and the Fig Tree would W in The Roots would wither up and die away so I I I began to look at there there's so many interesting things about a fig tree down through the uh all these Pagan religions and things they they take the Fig Tree and they turn it into twist it and turn it into uh these Cults and things that were around with when uh the first church was during that time period And there's all different kinds of things that you can look at but what I kind of want to look at is is is two pieces because when you come to a fig tree there there's there's different kinds of fig trees there's 900 different I believe 900 different kinds and and one of them is the sycamore tree that zakus climbed up on that trash can and climbed up in the bowels of it and to to get it another a good look at Jesus and when Jesus came by he was hiding up in that the syamore trees grow huge not a North American sycamore tree but a a syamore fig tree that grows in Israel but now there's a there's this other kind of fig tree that it has two fruits and it starts off with a little it's called a Brea fruit I believe that's Spanish for first fruit and if I'm pronouncing that wrong brother Lis forgive me but uh Brea fruit is a is a small little fruit that begins around the springtime spring and early summer and then later on in the August in the fall there's the main crop the a big Bounty the what what what every body's really interested in it seems like almost more people are not as much interested in that first fruit the Brea fuit fruit now I was kind of just about I I I I I've been uh looking at this for a while but about an hour before church service I was reading through some some uh notes and things and I found this one by this man named Alfred edin that he was one wondering about this fruit tree this fig tree and he he ended up going over to Israel because it concerned him about how that there could be no fruit on the Fig Tree and so he went over there and he he he found the place where they beli that Jesus had died and and the the right location everything he got into the right spot and he plunged his hand into the Fig Tree and grabbed a big old clump of leaves and he and he pulled out this little like a little fruit and he wondered about it so he had somebody there said unless you find those on the tree branches in the spring he was told the tree will not bear fruit in the summer cuz first you got to have that first fruit and then you can have the main crop amen now now look at what all all through the scripture it a lot of times it seems like things seem real complicated but this same pattern is rep repeated all through the scripture the seed goes into the ground it goes through a process it gets greater and greater and greater till it comes out with the original life and the Original Seed and you can look at that braa fruit or you can look at one of those individual figs from the main crop and both of those reflect the original life and the original seed right if you want to see what the original life and the Original Seed looks like then you look at the bra or you look at the the main crop because both reflect both identify I hope y'all can see where I'm going so now in Mark 4: 26:28 he said so is the kingdom of God as if a man should cast seed into the ground and should sleep and Rise night and day and the seed should spring and grow up he knoweth not how for the Earth bringeth for forth fruit of herself first the blade then the ear yeah after that the full corn in the ear right and Mark 43-33 he said where unto shall we like in the kingdom of God or with what comparison shall We compare it it is like a grain of mustard seed right which when it is swn in the earth is less than all the seeds that be in the Earth by appearance and all the things that we evaluate right but think about the true Worth right but when it is sown it groweth up and becometh greater than all herbs amen and shooteth out great branches so that the fowls of the air May Lodge under the shadow of it right so as you as I kind of read through these quotes keep in mind I I want to kind of speak on a on maybe a topic of of greater and greater because that's how God works from the from the very beginning he's moving down greater and greater even in your own life you can examine your new birth and if things are not becoming greater and greater then there's a problem somewhere you look at a a little child and if they're not growing if their growth is stunning then there's a problem somewhere move on up into the teenage years if if if they start getting real skinny or whatever there might be a little a little a demon of anarasia or something that's that's getting in the way yeah you need to Be watchful for for a lack of growth a stunning of growth and a growth in a Christian is caused by not feasting on the word and not spending time with God can you it takes both now it takes both you got to read the word and spend time with God communion is what we've been talking about in communion and Sunday school because God the the whole purpose of the Bible is to bring us back into fellowship with him to bring us back in line with him into perfect communion so that well I'm going to read some quotes in a minute so that we are one amen flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone so what God's doing is down through the the Bible he's magnifying himself he's making himself how could God how could Christ be greater than the bride because it takes something greater to redeem us but he's magnifying himself through a work coming down through the seven Church ages coming down through the Bible making himself greater coming down through the apostles and prophets in the Old Testament until the word was standing there made flesh among them and they could they could talk to him and walk with him and shake hands with him and fish with him and eat bread with him and take advantage of him being in their in their presence but so many of them fail to realize who he was and what he was doing there and now down through the seven Church ages he's repeating that process through a growth process he's magnifying himself until he's full the fullness of the godhead bodily is in the bride and if you want to see God you you you got to see him through the bride so look what look what Jesus did when that when he came and and stood there on the shores of Galilee and walked and talked with the men he he began to take that he took that Old Testament law and magnified it right now he because uh now the full word was there and unto whom much is given much is required you say well well how would you meet that requirement how would you meet this requirement of the the magnified word let me go over to Matthew 5 real quick and read some of these new requirements of the magnified law cuz that was a I got to looking at Martin Luther and his main antagonist you know every every time brother brand I'm T that every time the word begins to come forth the seed is sewn and it begins to grow then the devil will come along and try to rip it up he'll try to and you can watch that in church in your own life when something is fixing to happen spiritually Here Comes The Devil oh yeah so uh down through history uh John had serenus uh Martin Luther had this man named arasmus and and they they were constantly at Battle and arasmus would say he his main thing that he said was that uh there's a little bit of light inside of you even without the new birth and and that calls out to uh you know there's something good in you even without the new birth which uh which is I'm going read some things that he said in a little bit I'm kind of jumping ahead uh but when Jesus came and magnified the law in Matthew 5: 211 he said for I say unto you that ex except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven and that's how he starts off the magnification process my what a what a requirement to exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees they look like they're living according to every requirement that's ye have heard that it was said by them of old time Thou shalt not kill and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the Judgment but I say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a call shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoever shall say to his brother Rea shall be in danger of the counsel but whosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of Hellfire let me skip down ye have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you that you resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also at verse 39 and if any man will sue thee at the GLW and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him Twain give to him that asketh thee and from him that borrow of thee turn not thou away ye have heard that it hath been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust and and and so forth and so on then he finishes with be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect and these requirements that he laid down magnifying the law or requirements that nobody can keep outside of the new birth and uh that's that's what Martin Luther and arasmus differed on arasmus said that in myself I have a quality that that can save myself and Martin Luther said there's the Bible says there's nothing good in my flesh and and nothing doesn't mean a little something is the words that he used and and Jesus said he he he Thou shalt not commit adultery to look he magnified even to look upon a woman uh in the Old Testament you could just write write a writing of divorcement but now uh you cause her to commit adultery if you put away and if you marry one that's been put away you commit adultery and the Sabbath day magnifying it the Sabbath day uh in the Old Testament was on the on that Saturday but now that you enter into a day of rest through the new birth and all these things he's magnifying it growing it through down through the Bible magnifying and growing because he's manifesting his attributes she's putting them on display and now look in the Old Testament Moses took his rod and he he he he took that rod and he threw it on the ground something that he had in his hand he threw it on the ground and it turned into a serpent he took up something off the ground and he he took sand and he threw it up in the air and it turned into fleas Jesus Took fish in his hand and he broke it right and gave it out but now you don't have to have anything in your hand that's right that's what that's what brother brand said he spoke the squirrels into existence he spoke uh the storm out of existence he gave salvation to had Rice's uh children sons and Romans 8 1-8 because what what God is doing he is he's restoring he's bringing us back he's destroying the eny that was put between us in the Garden of Eden when Adam and Eve Eve fail because through disbelief because Romans 818 says that there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit now that's how you meet all those requirements for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit right and verse 7 because the carnal mind is imity against God and skip it on down to verse 7 but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his I'm getting behind with my quote reading let me read some quotes let's go to number one have faith faith in God I wonder why he didn't wait to find out whether that tree was going to wither away or not what did Jesus do to that tree right he merely called the life out of it he didn't wait to see if it withered away or not he knew it w would wither away he had said so and the word of God was in him and whatever he said it had to come to pass because it was God speaking out of a man and everything that God was God ented his entire being into Jesus Christ and everything Jesus Christ was exactly he emptied into the church Glory now here's the problem that's what's the matter with the Pentecostal church tonight the Full Gospel people right they just don't realize who they are you don't realize the power that's right in this building tonight but it's harnessed down by unbelief that's the only thing if God could ever get an Avenue to work through you it would be marvelous what he could do but is harnessed You Won't Let it Loose you keep it with your unbelief amen right now that's why it's so important to eat that sincere milk of the word because it's blasting out all of our unbelief amen he's he's got us on the threshing floor like Boaz where he's threshing out all the stuff that's not supposed to be in our life moving us at the Statue of a perfect man moving us into perfect harmony with him let's go to number two there is a man here that can turn on the light it was Moses even picked up say and said let there be fleas and so forth like that upon the Earth but in this last day he doesn't take anything see just the word let it be and it is what is said that's the way it'll be amen I want to testify of some of those things tonight see see what's happened that you can see he is still God his words cannot these works that I do shall you also and greater than this shall you do I took a fish to make a fish you don't even have to have a fish he is still God is still the same son the same Son of God that took a fish off of a fish it's the same Son of God today these works that I do shall you also even greater than this will you do it'll be magnified greater than this shall you do that you know we sing that song only believe all things are possible but do we still believe it that's right it that's it brother that's right exactly right because you know that was that that fig tree had two fruits a first fruit and then the main crop and you can pour everything to say well brother brandham it's all for brother brandham but there's a main crop too that he was pointing he was building us to all things are possible to him that believe doesn't mean that all things are possible just to somebody else it means that all things are possible to whoever needs it whenever you have a need we're getting into some good stuff here because now now go back to Genesis Genesis chapter 2 verse 20 see look God when God grows is different than the way when when think when God is moving something along in a growth pattern it looks different than the way we think we think it's got to get bigger and bigger look when when Noah got off that Arc and he looked and he saw that rainbow he could look and follow the curve of that rainbow up up up but it reached his sepex and it began a downward journey and then it went into the earth look what God's doing he's putting that rainbow into your Earth he's putting that seven colored rainbow down inside of you so that you're manifesting his attributes and he he brought that rainbow around and it got up to the top and it came on down down and look look what God's doing in Genesis he's coming down down but he's making he's magnifying himself and he got down and it looked like he's finished and he spoke Adam in existence brother Rand said it took years and years and years until finally Eve came out from his side and then it looks like he's done brother BR said he stopped he stopped speaking look he stopped speaking and now the voice is in the prophets God's not speaking so much he said you know let there be light let there rolling the worlds off of his finger tips and now he's putting his voice inside of people and in Genesis 2:20 through 22 let me let me let me stop and read that the Lord verse 21 through 22 and the Lord God calls a deep sleep to fall upon Adam God likes to put people in sleep in the scriptures when he takes them out of the equation he put Adam into a deep sleep you don't have nothing to do with the sanctification that I'm going to give you he put Adam into a deep sleep just like he went down the second Adam went down into death to bring out that to bring out his bride and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he and he took one of his ribs and closed up the Flesh and stay thereof he took out a rib from from Brother brand described it under his NE right next to his heart it was close close to him now why didn't God just speak Eve into existence why did he have to come that way out of his out of his side because she would mean something because she would mean something special to Adam she would be so important to him something that he would he would be willing to do whatever it took to get back and he tried to go out and get her but it just wasn't part of him it wasn't an attribute of him to go out and get her and come back but it is an attribute of Jesus Christ that he can go out and bring his bride back because his bride came from his side and he that's why you you look at that and see well she's nothing because she's just a byproduct but that byproduct meant more to him than she's part of him she's flesh of his flesh bone of his bone and the way brother Ram described that flesh flesh of God's flesh is word and if we have the same Spirit and the same flesh built upon the word the spirit and truth uniting then we're a word born bride and that's what God's coming back for a masterpiece that he's made built upon his word and look why did he do it this way what what is God do trying to do he's trying to take that breb of fruit and manifest that main crop amen right he's trying to reproduce himself he's trying to take all the attributes that were in the book and show them to the world you can't that that scripture says if you if you've got a light don't you you don't want to hide it you don't want to put it under a bushel it's going to be manifest to the things that are done in secret are going to be shown to the world and now what's God doing now all around the world he's got a bride that's gathering together and and you walk on the street he said the people won't read the Bible but you are the Bible you are the Bible to them because your written Epistles known and read of all men and what was written in that book before the foundation of the world now is written in you and it's been quickened by the spirit to bring to life it's not just written on the pages anymore it's not just written in heaven anymore but now it's written in youl so each had a purpose Adam to bring life and Eve to bring life to reproduce she was part of Adam flesh of his flesh bone of his bone and then the devil got in there see right as soon as something begins to happen go soon as God begins to do something soon as Martin Luther began the Reformation started here comes arasmus soon as as as John soon every soon as Jesus Judas all down through the Old Testament all down through the new there's always a combatant and that started enity now now think about going down through some Old Testament types you got Elijah and Elisha Elisha said if I'm going to stay with you no matter what you now we're thinking about greater and greater Move Along greater and greater through the Old Testament greater and greater through your individual life am your individual walk and Elisha got called and he was following the prophet and he said I'll stay with you and he and he watched as Elijah spoke and and the and the water parted over Jordan and they crossed over and Elijah went up in the fiery Chariot and Elisha said my God my God and the the Chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof and Elijah's mantel fell back on him typing a spiritual Manel that would fall on the Believers amen that that we would do greater works and we know that Elisha did the 16 uh Miracles soon as he soon as that manle fell he he went right back and he got to the Jordan River and he said I wonder if that promise has been fulfilled he took that mantle and he slapped the river and said where is the god of Elijah and the and the river parted and he walked across I remember hearing about this this uh little missionary this was years ago uh right after I was born again and he said he was somebody was tell telling about they were they were overseas and this little missionary came to a situation like that and he said Lord I've got these books that I'm trying to get across this River where is the god of Elijah and all things are possible to them that believe and the water parted and he crossed over and got the tapes to the other side not not to clown around or anything but when go you have a need when you have a need God is God is able he's still the same you say well brother Bob I don't see it in your life well I'm talking about all of us I'm talking about we we're all growing we're all Elijah 16 Miracles The Same Spirit look go growing down through the Old Testament when it got to John and John said Jesus said about John that there's nobody none great as great as this as this Prophet that's ever been but he said there's coming one after me that's even greater that I'm not even worthy to loose the latches of his chws cuz look how the five comings Elijah goes greater and greater and greater Elijah then Elisha doubled and then John the Baptist the greatest and then in this day a prophet with the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right that can bring us the word am and then take it on down make sure I didn't miss any quotes I'm trying to keep up with quotes and the Old Testament as they journeyed through the Wilderness the Tabernacle was the place where you had to come to worship yep because God put his name there amen yeah and it had it had trellis sides not solid but the little beams on the sides of it and you know uh the the word in the in the Hebrew for those TR size is is the same as as as it was used for Adam's Rib those that that that uh Tabernacle in the wilderness was made to type Jesus Christ that's that's of course it it was covered in Badger skins and it had those three compartments outer cord inner Court holy of holies and you know what's really striking is all scripture was given for by inspiration it just it's amazing how everything just ties together so perfectly in Exodus 26 when you start looking at the description of the Tabernacle the description of that Old Testament Tabernacle is starts from the inside and works out because it begins with the Ark of the Covenant and works out out out because God's coming down but as he's coming down he's magnifying himself he's trying to manifest his attributes to the people now this is a little bit different from Solomon's Temple because Solomon's Temple the description of that in I believe First Kings chapter 6 is from the outside in they start going from the Tabernacle out inward inward see even the description that that all these little details are just so perfect in the Bible because they're showing something they're showing God's great plan that he's coming he came down with that Tabernacle typing Christ so that we could come into to him now that Tabernacle took went on a little journey through the Wilderness and when it got to the end of his journey it David's Tabernacle went through a little journey through the the ark was captured by the Philistines and all those different little things but when it came to its end D the Lord laid upon David's heart to build a tabernacle where the Lord could dwell in right and and of course David couldn't do it but Solomon began to build this Tabernacle this Temple that the stones were gathered from all around the world and if you wanted to worship God remember Solomon's Prayer was after that Tabernacle was built he said let let your believers wherever they are in the world turn toward this Temple and remember Jonah when he was down in the belly of that well he he said Lord his prayer was I remember what Solomon's Prayer was because I'm praying that you'll deliver me from this situation he was turning toward that Temple because the temple was a a type of the believer in Christ all the Believers from around the world just like all those stones that were gathered from all different parts of the world remember that when Noah when God told Noah to build the ark he he went out and he got wood chatim wood from all the different places all around in the countryside and he pitched them within and without pitched him within and without just like all the Believers and he put them together into an ark where he could be safe that Solomon's Temple he brought stones from all around the world all s brought them in on boats and things and it was built without the sound of a hammer now you see how God moves things silently he's he's he's building his church silently on his word just like how you know brother brandham explained how God can move water out of the ocean and make a CL a storm cloud and different things without without just one sound right that's what he's doing true that pillar that Temple was God God manifesting his work for the whole world to see the Queen of Sheba the kings of the earth tire and S and they all came right to worship God at that Temple amen now look let me read some quotes real quick let's look at number three I'm going I'm kind of going back in the timeline of my sermon a little bit and questions and answers on Hebrews she become a byproduct of a man because she's part of him there're the angels and God and the spirit that's joined with God is one Spirit that's right now the spirit of God that dwells in the church is the spirit that come from Heaven that God knew before the foundation of the world that rejected the devil's lie and that Spirit had to take a body of Flesh to take his testings right he had to come flesh like these others did and all of them put on the equal yoke and God by the beginning know the spirits that would and which would not there you are that devil is so wise he has deceived the very elect if possible right so we're coming up to Jesus the greatest the word made Ben flesh the full the full fullness of the godhead bodily let's look at number quote number six an identification brother randam said sinless nature expressed the word of God so much that he and the Word was one amen he said so I and my father are one I do always that what pleases I and my father are just one he was so perfect in the image of God until he and God was the expressed same thing amen he was the flesh the son that expressed the deity of God so that made him deity in a man glory in order to redeem a man amen see he and the Word was one in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh so he and the word became one that the word could express that could show to the world that example of what man should be amen exactly right I don't forget about that breba fruit that first fruit so what that first fruit is that last that main crop's got to be too and it it is let's go to number 11 it is the rising of the Sun and as he being the groom number 11 second paragraph or paragraph 111 as he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others has spoke of the Bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power power of his power she is him as man and woman are one and woman taken from his side she had taken a spirit the feminine Spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and Dynamics the wife the spirit of him and the Flesh of him and put it together and made mechanics and Dynamics until the church or the people and then he goes on to describe greater and greater amen and what confused all the Pharisees and the Sadducees of that day is when he said I and my father are one right and that uh when he started saying things like that declared himself to be one with God declaring himself to be the manifestation of the father that if you wanted to see what the father was that you would had had to come to him and that's when they began to separate from him now go back to that that fig tree if you want to see what that that Original Seed is is that original life you've got to look at what what's being born by that fig tree now Jesus came walking down the road and he looked under that that breb the breb of fruit hides up under the leaves in the spring of the year and he looked and he he he was looking at those leaves uh and he walked up to it and he reached up under there and there was nothing there now John the Baptist even he he preached that the ax is laid to the root of the tree what kind of tree if there's no fruit if there's no good fruit right and fruit is the teaching made manifest the the growth process completed the word of God made manifest and when there's no fruit how how do you know what the original life is if there's no fruit made manifest how do you know what's in the root of the tree and when he saw that there was no fruit on the tree he cursed the root of the tree because the root was not bearing forth fruit if the Root's not right I I've got a scripture in here somewhere but if the Root's not right it it it won't bear fruit let me read Luke 8 verse uh 11-1 17 now Parable is this the seed is the word of God those by the wayside are they that hear then cometh the devil that's what we're talking about as soon as God sews the seed Here Comes somebody to combat that then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts lest they should believe and be saved they on the Rock are they which when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root which for a while believe and in time of Temptation fall away and that which fell among Thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to Perfection but that that that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience no man when he hath lighted a candle cover with coverthe with a vessel or putteth it under a bed but Seth it on a Candlestick that they which enter in may see the light for nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest neither anything hi that shall not be known and come abroad which is what God did with Jesus Christ he made him known to the world he lifted him up on that cross so that the world could see and the world has seen down through 2,000 years that that what God has done they've heard about it right and now God is making manifest his bride through all the world when the gospel goes through all the world is what the promise is right for nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest cuz God's doing something in his bride let's look at quote number three oh we already read that quote number four and I have no int ention of keeping everybody late tonight so don't be alarmed show us the father and it'll suffice us and see in the same results by human being so submitted to God until the Holy Spirit can work through those human beings just like the Holy Spirit worked through Jesus who just has confessed that I and my father are one my father dwelleth in me he doeth the works it's not my words it's his words see he was so submitted to God and he died and Sanctified a church that he might live in to continue his works until the second Advent of his coming right he comes the second time so it's going to grow and grow and grow until when until the coming of the Lord it it should be growing the word should be made magnifying in your life magnifying in the bride right up until the coming of the Lord and it looks like maybe to the to the uh I'll say the untrained eye that things are getting are getting uh look look what happened in Jesus's life as it became greater and greater and greater and his life's work was about to be achieved it looked like things were getting worse and worse and worse he was Dripping drops of blood in the Garden of Gethsemane they tore his flesh off and lifted up on on cross naked and that was the defining moment in his life right and now maybe as the the sun is Rip in the bride and and and we're bowing over like wheat because we've come to full maturity maybe it looks a little bit like things are not going well but oh yeah but it is I believe it that's right amen let's look at number five why then why don't God make it live again in them men if it's God's word I am my father father are one not three we are one God is in him God speaks through him he's no more his own but he's God's Voice through human lips amen and every believer in him tonight is likewise possessed so possessed so completely given over till his words become like the words of Christ he speaks and the word is made flesh Glory he speaks and the word is manifested right let's look at let's look at number seven is the bride of Christ and the body of Christ the same is what somebody said yes sir when God give Christ his bride the spirit gave the flesh the bride he was pierced in the side under his heart and water blood and Spirit came forth that become flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone we are the Flesh and Bones the bride will be the Flesh and Bones of Christ exactly they are that is his bride GL let's look at number eight now and when you see the word made manifest you see the father amen God because the word is the Father the word is God and the word made manifest is God himself taking his own word and manifesting it among Believers nothing can make it live but Believers just Believers right right now there's that question that brother Brandon preached on so many times show us the father and it will suffice of us and there was the father made manifest them that bra fruit right but now God is the father is making himself manifest in his bride to show himself to the world in that main crop right amen let's look at number nine I'm just running through some quotes real quick now the smiting of Christ was for a cause that he might take from him one to be a family the bride amen he might take him a bride so when his Masterpiece was perfected then he had to Smite it to take it from him not another piece not another creation but the same creation right my brother don't think bad at this but think a minute if he took from him the original creation to make the bride for him he never made another creation he took a part of the original creation and then if he was the word what must the bride be it's got to be the original word Living God in the word am and that confounds the unbeliever y remember in Sunday school we were looking through Jeremiah 52 that baale is confounded he tried to build that that that uh Tower of Babel and you know you can follow it all down through the through uh the Old Testament things and uh the one that was trying to confuse the real believer now ends up confused and I'm I'm I'm I'm going just kind of wrap it up here in just a minute but because I want to look real quick at at some of these things that Aras was said about Luther because you can see that the same thing kind of repeated today as people look upon the bride of Christ and fail to see what's going on even sometimes sitting in amongst the churches because arasmus he he had this this idea that everything was supposed to be peaceful and lovey-dovey and you know Luther was one of my favorite characters because he was he was almost bombastic and he would he would he would just call it like it was he'd say um arasmus is is just another Caiaphas he's uh he's a he's a serpent and and vile and all this kind of all that kind of stuff and so arasmus was begin he began to look upon what Luther was doing and you know as as Luther and arasmus started off Luther he did everything everything he could to arasmus was his friend and he he did everything he could to get him over out of the Catholic church over to the Reformation side and and try to get him saved and everything you know when arasmus died um Luther had some harsh things to say about about him but at the very beginning he just he did everything he could to save his soul and arasa said the Reformation seemed to have had no other purpose than to turn monks and nuns into bridegrooms and Brides he was he was looking at what Luther was doing he said this new gospel is producing a new set of men so impudent hypocritical and abusive such as liars and Psychopaths who agree neither with one another nor with anybody else so universally offensive and seditious such mad men and ranters and in short so utterly dis tasteful to me that if I knew of any City in which I should be free from them I would remove there at once but now look you can look upon the bride today with critical eyes and say well nobody agrees with one another one another and and things like you look that that's that Temple that Solomon built was each Stone was hued out in this way and that because each one of us need to be sliced and diced a little bit differently so that we'll fit into the building but after it's all said and done we're all cohesive like that not Noah Arc we're we're pitched within and without and we're God's drawing us together not just in fellowship with him but fellowship with one another because how can we fellowship with one another outside of the new birth we well argue and fight and fuss but God's bringing us into communion through the word he said wherever Lutheranism prevails see how carnal Whenever Wherever Lutheranism prevails learning and liberal culture go to the ground can you believe he he he embraced so much the the learning and the Theology and things that he failed to see what God was doing in that day he said the study of tongues like languages and the love of fine literature is everywhere growing cold Luther has heaped insufferable odium on it because he loved the study of languages and fine literature more than the word of God he said what can be more ruinous than to let such words as The Following come to the people's ears the pope is Antichrist Bishops and Priests are mere grubs man-made laws are heretical confession is pernicious Works merits and Endeavors are heretical words there is no free will now that sounds a little bit strange that he would say that about Martin Luther that there's no free will you remember that was one of the big debates that Martin Luther and and arasmus had and the issue was not so much free will but it was that there's something within you that that can save you which was what arasmus was arguing about everything happens my necessity I see under the pretext of the Gospel a new bold Shameless and ungovernable race growing up in a world in a word such a one as will be unendurable to Luther himself I'm sharing these because it this the same thing is repeating itself today it repeated itself through through John Wesley's Age and and now today where you you look if you look upon the bride with carnal eyes it looks like things are are not going well but God's doing something he's moving in an individual life what else has been accomplished therefore I ask by so many harsh little books by so many harsh little books Yeah by so so much foolish talk by so many formidable threats and by so much bombast Luther could have taught the Evangelical philosophy with great profit to the Christian flock he could have benefited the World by bringing forth books if he had restrained from those things which could only end in disturbance cuz he's concerned about disturbance are we concerned about hurting somebody's feelings today are we concerned about creating a disturbance a disturbance at work a disturbance in your neighborhood yeah is isn't that what Jesus said that he came yep to bring the sword to to put at variance father and and and uh son and and so forth amen when the word comes and and is manifested in your life sometimes it it causes Discord right above all I am of the opinion now this is this is what arasmus is saying above all I am of the opinion that Discord ruinous for all must be avoided and that thus by what I might call a holy artfulness the needs of the time must be served that by no means the treasury of the Gospel truth be betrayed whence can come the Reformation of corrupt public morals perhaps someone will ask whether I have another mind regarding Luther than I had formerly no indeed I have the same mind I have always wished that with changes made of certain things which were displeasing to to me he discussed purely the gospel Philosophy from which the morals of our age have departed Al last too far I have always preferred that he be corrected rather than suppressed you know Luther had some again he's one of my favorite characters he said about arasmus arasmus of roddam is the viest miscreant that ever disgraced the Earth he is a very caiaphus and he said shame upon the our csed wret whenever I pray I pray a curse upon arasmus he said this I do leave behind me as my will and testament I hold arasmus of rodam to be Christ's most bitter enemy the enemy to True Religion the open adversary of Christ the complete and faithful picture and image of Epicurious and of Lucian cuz what he failed to see was what he failed to see the original life made manifest in that fig tree the fig tree that had grown up through a growth process down through up until that point because like like John let's see like John Wesley said brother Brandon like to quote him he said May there not leave in our bosom that burning may it never lead may it swell greater and greater until it throws us to our knees to beg and persuade and John Wesley said catch on fire and others will love to come watch you burn Amen in Matthew 24 32-33 now learn a parable of the Fig Tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves ye know that summer is nigh so likewise ye when you shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doors so look God's God manifesting himself in his bride so that you know the world wants to see show us the father and it'll suffice us they want to see God they want to know him the only way that you can know God is through his bride right the only way that you can get to him that's why you know people today say well that we don't need the fivefold ministry and things but if you don't hear the word how will you know the father if you don't have somebody that can instruct you and show you and teach you these things and make it manifest amen like Philip Philip Philip was one of those characters in the Bible that that he ran around calling people he he went Nathaniel and brought him to Jesus he went to the Ethiopian unic and showed him what was written in the word now what would we do without Phillip right Amen to show us what's written in the word and and so that we can be built up on the word and come into close communion with god so let's uh let's just stand to our feet real quick and I I'll just pray over you if you have any special need maybe just lift your hand let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we just thank you God for your presence here tonight Lord thank you God for your goodness to us Lord and for your

know I was just thinking while our brother was preaching you know communication is a wonderful thing but the point I was thinking about that you know God can speak in every language in the world and understand every language right and in every language it's a little bit different the way the wording is the way the things are if I miss this don't worry about it but like we say uh let's go to town or something well maybe in the the Spanish is the town we go it turns a little bit in a way of to where it has a little different expression but you know to the people it means the same well you know when we get over there one of these days it won't be but one language what will it be it be a Heavenly language but and but we'll all be able to have that communication you know amen an expression well what should be then the the expression of every Christian faith around the world that no matter what the language is or the wording they use whether it it's goooo Gaga or whatever it is you know it's a language the thought is the god of the word and you know that everybody as our brother was bringing about Luther you know that all born again Christians no matter what world part of the world they were in or what language they were using you know what they could understand what the man was talking about that the just shall live by faith amen that's one ful isn't it to just think about God's word make sure you tell her brother how much you appreciate the ministry and appreciate the word of the Lorden remember now gather Saturday about 1:00 down at Gillsville to City Park and we'll
