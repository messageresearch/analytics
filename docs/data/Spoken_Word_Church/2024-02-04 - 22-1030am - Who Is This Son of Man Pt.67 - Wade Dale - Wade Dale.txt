should have went to hell right but God had a plan he had Sons and Daughters of God that he was going to bring on this Earth by the way of the fall and he was going to turn this thing around right in the middle of Satan's Eden and that's what we believe is going on now amen Satan got into God's Eden well now God just turned right around and got into Satan's Eden amen so that's all it is now the everything's going on in the world did you see where the 150 something people got killed trampled to death in China or wherever it was over there South Korea just because somebody must have screamed Boo or shot a firecracker or something they were having a Halloween concert or something and they were so packed in 150 people where were trampled to death just in one street one area 150 people and all of them 90% of them were below the age of 20 so what a bunch of lives that got cut off just because of a Halloween somebody trying trying to celebrate Halloween but that's man that and you know what that wasn't God that was a devil that's right the devil prided hisself in doing that but you know what he Prides himself more is getting into me and you amen bothering me and you is his pride and joy is to make us what to make us worry and all these things that we're getting ready to talk about we're still on who is this son of man but remember we're still talking about it's all in your head amen this is not so we're not going to remember the bad things right so the bad things we go through we're just not even going to remember them you know what God don't remember them so we aren't going to remember them he's going to wipe all that away and we're we're going to we're going to know the good things things we're going to know the good times that we had but we're not going to know the bad times you say how does God do that doesn't matter he's God he can do it and I'm glad he's doing it amen let's remember the ones that are coming back from the Youth Camp if you've been watching the

bow our heads Lord Jesus thank you for this time you've give us Lord to stand and speak to your people Lord we know that were all insufficient as we were saying we needed Mercy we need Grace we need all these things but you gave it to us so once you gave it to us and we enter into it Lord then then you said be therefore perfect and you gave us Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelist to preach the perfect word to us that will make us perfect Lord not so much not in our flesh that comes at the change of the body but Lord to get this Inner Man started right get him on his journey right and and Lord we live for you father just forgive us of our sins and mistakes be with the ones that are at the um youth service Lord bless brother Jason Watkins brother Matthew and all the different ones the ministers that are up there brother Josh Bennett and excuse me brother Andrew Glover the different ones that are ministering Lord we pray that you'd just be with them Father give them Supernatural strength I know they're going to be tired after 3 or 4 days of doing this I pray that you'll give them strength Lord for Monday father just give us this day our daily bread and bless us in Jesus name amen who is this son of man part 67 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh that's what it's got to happen that in the end time that is the son of man brother brother BR what is who is the son of man he's the in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory now that's what I want you we're going to talk about that little piece of it beh how you going to behold his glory if he he's not here how you going to do that through you through you you're his glory you're his victory you're what he's going to produce to the Earth through me and you cuz he's not here in physical form he's not here he's only here in spirit form the Son of God but the son of man Ministry is going to have to come back in the last days to change our bodies cuz that's what it done with the son of man it changed his body is that right so that's what we're heading toward it but we got to come to step by step we can't go to the first grade and 12th grade we got to go 1 2 3 4 5 all the way up and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you know if you're born again today you're the only begotten of the father you're not begotten of you you say well I'm the third child of my mom and daddy you might be but if you're born again you're the first child of God Amen you got to start thinking yourself that way there is no there is no uh family and then you've got this one born first and no we're all born again Believers the Son of God Revelation that we're going to look at here in just a second look full of grace and truth how we going to be full of grace and truth by the word of God Amen first Thessalonians said that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel and sanctification and honor you say well I need some help well God's going to help you but you're going to have to make an effort you're going to be possessed of one of the other we'll talk about that a little bit in in the sermon and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind not your neighbors not your wives your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God you may be seated see that it says you may prove we know God's going to prove through us but we've got to be a yielded vessel for that to happen is everybody with me amen for that to happen you got to be a yielded vessel to yield yourself to God and that God can what work through you with you brother Bram said you and God in there as persons amen you don't lose your personality when you get born again you receive the personality of God and that what vulcanizers with your soul as we're going to talk about the heart in just a minute because you got to start with the heart then you come to the five outer senses and then you got the five Outer Outer Outer senses that you are well that you are well you're sitting here today St with it memory Reon conscious you're hearing what I'm saying you're seeing all right SE taste feel smelling here then you've got memor Reas and conscious effects and Imagination then you've got what faith or doubt and that's the only senses that you have to work with thank God for a prophet that he could separate them yet make sure that they stay together because you if you pull them apart you're dead all right the soul without the spirit Bible says flesh without the spirit is dead it's all dead so now you're what Triune being that God has put on this Earth Let It Be by permissive will or sexual act as permitted by God to get you here for you to make a choice so it's all look everything we talk about today is by choice by your free moral agency even though you may be born again if you don't have free moral agency then God is going to just pull you a tube he's going to pull you up the statute of perfect man no brother so you got to fight for every inch of you of what you're looking for right all right we'll call just a minute I got to hurry through this all right you remember first thing you got to do is be born again now what is that you got to be changed so the soul has got to be changed not exchanged taken out another one put in no that'd be really easy and that wouldn't be you cuz you were born a unit a body a spirit and a soul that's you brother BR my SW said I don't believe in transmigration I don't believe in reincarnation in other words I don't believe in pre-existence of souls all right so let's get away from that oh brother I thought I saw you before the foundation of world now in the word of God maybe you did but you didn't see my person my person didn't come into being till we came on this Earth amen so let's just take away all that other stuff and my soul didn't migrate over to somebody else's nobody would want it and the congregation said amen you didn't have to say it that much and he gave some how we going to do this we know this but we've got to we've got to see he gave some Apostles prophets pastors evangelists and teachers for what the perfecting of the Saints so you can get it but you can't grow without it you can get the new birth but you can't grow without having these five folds of the ministry of God in your life that's why we try to bring evangelist in and different ones and and uh and seeking for some that come a little bit later for the what for the Perfection of the Saints what for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come to the unity of faith and of what of the knowledge we're going to talk about that a little bit later we know that there's a knowledge up here and we know that there's a worldly knowledge that's why we've got to have a a mind not a mind take my mind out and put the mind of God in Paul says we got to have the mind of Christ which works through your mind because you're still a human being over here all right we still have human thoughts we still have human ideas but we've got to bring it what into the center Center realm and then work its way out all right because the very Fountain of you today is your soul the very Fountain of you is your heart whatever we're going to read it in just a minute or maybe this afternoon the Bible says out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh out of the abundance of the heart your mouth speaks what is the abundance of the heart not this thing right here this is flesh but it's your soul it's your psyche it's you and then that you works it way out to memory reads and conscious effects and Imagination and then Works your out and all this does it does what it tell told to do I'm doing this because somewhere in my brain is telling me to do this cuz I want to because I've thought about it everybody with me you say what's this got to do with a statue of perfect man it we got to have a mind we got to have a mind change that's got to change our thoughts amen it's got It's got to change it but it's got to start from the heart all right let's read this right here so the knowledge of what the son of God unto a perfect man look that we henceforth be no more children and that's fine you know it's you can't take it out of the Bible lay hands on the sick but there is a time where it come to where you going to have to speak the word amen there's got a time to where you've got to speak the word not somebody else you've got to speak the word not waiting on the preacher to speak the word not waiting on the prophet of God to come back he's already spoke the word but you and I to speak the word to have enough Faith inside of oursel to what have power with character that we're going to talk about in a minute power with character fit to what rule over what you first rule over me first I got to get me under control I got to get me under control so that starts though by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Son of God the revelation of the Son of God where Jesus kept talk kept talking kept talking he was the son of God but he was also what the son of man the Son of God was speaking through that son of man everybody with me right and he never had he never made now he made human mistakes but he never made a mistake in the word he never misquoted the Old Testament he never said oh I'm sorry I didn't mean to say that no what he said he said my words are spirit and their life and he didn't back off from it one bit why because he was all of of it total the son of man you and I when we get up to that Capstone that's why the seals when the seals broke that broke so that we could have an ability to think just like Jesus thought to talk just like Jesus talked now sorry to say that in the Son of God Revelation you can have some false teaching everybody with me you can have some false teaching you said prove it Martin Luther he was a Son of God he taught a trinitarian doctrine that didn't come from his soul somehow in his memories and conscious effects and Imagination Satan put a dart in there so a Son of God can be deceived brother brandham preached a mighty conqueror in 1957 5859 preached it from Revelation 6 verse1 but when he got to the first seal he said I made a horrible mistake why he was getting ready to move into that the revelation of the son of man where what he what come out of his mouth was what God was teaching to people it was the mind of God think of what before then man come on people before then there was confusion there's still confusion now but before then there was so much confusion was it this was it that was it Trinity was it Oneness was it Tess was it three was it water baptism this way or that way brother random under the ministry of the Son of God he brings that back to what the faith of the fathers all right he brings that back to the faith of the fathers and when he brings it back to the faith of the fathers he then thinks he's finished and then we've quoted it many times brother D's preached on it for years and years and years about he's come to a place he said not in the years of preparation where's the years of preparation listen this is the years of mine and your preparation this is when you grow what your years listen each and every one of you sitting here today has a purpose either in God or the devil well praise the Lord who else well I got a purpose either God or the devil one of the two excuse me for drinking so much my throat's a little bit little bit sore but the Son of God Revelation is our growing time everybody with Meen because Jesus had to grow in Grace and knowledge the Bible says and being made perfect I'm reading Bible what he became the what the author the author he he wrote something down he wrote a book what'd he write me and you he wrote away from me and you to become that but remember that was rejected the top part where it says son of man that justification we're coming to that sanctification we're coming to and that body change we are coming com to but it started on the day of Pentecost or it started on what your day of Pentecost by the new birth you you had a day of Pentecost where a tongue of fire lit on top of your head and went down into your soul and burnt the devil out didn't kill your soul that burned him out drove him out the unclean Spirit goes out of a man but you had it sealed in by God so there was no way sat could get back in but where did he go he went to your second realm memories and conscious affection in ination that's where he's working that's what brother Brown said the greatest battle ever fought was what in your mind what is your mind every thought everything you do develops from your mind everything you do develops from your thoughts amen that's what we're going to talk about if we get to it Peter says for as so is the will of God this is this is something I I I want us to see this so much because you know what Jesus stood many many times and the Common People heard him gladly the cers Hur him the prostitutes Matthew Mark Luke and John they all heard him they all heard Jesus it's man there's nobody ever spoke like this man but where was his trouble his trouble was with the Pharisees and the Sadducees his trouble was with the religious world he I don't say he couldn't stand them but every time he got around him he started calling them names everybody with me he he was he didn't he wasn't no soft stoping he said you snakes you vipers father of the devil so what was he doing he was telling the people he said look I can't do this all by myself hello somebody I'm going to have 120 that's going to start here in just a little while when I leave there's going to be 120 me come back you going to have to deal with all them and then you're going to bring Paul into court you're going to bring Peter into court you're going to bring James into court John and here we go they can't here I am one man but they're all over the place now so what did it do it put to silence the ignorance of foolish man men for so is the will of God so this is the will what is the will of God the word of God is that with well doing you may put to silence not that you're both F but God's going to put the he's going to put the words in your mouth and it's going to make the people silent The Silence of what foolish men if you got to baptism of the Holy Ghost today you are not foolish can't be your Soul's as Eternal as God is it's not Eternal as God is it is God right let's get on down here said here's what it is it's easy to fill the power of God we're going to get to this a little bit later and I'm going to read you a real shocking quote to see it when you believe but then when it comes to The Showdown are you able to possess the thing that you profess to have do we as Lula Georgia possess what we profess to have that's my question to all of us that's the thing brother we've got to get it we've got to take it it's ours but you'll fight for every inch it's a struggle I told Bob Louis and Aaron I said y'all won't be preaching much cuz you come from here did I right you make one round and that's about it CU when you start preaching and teaching the word of God to people pastors get jealous but why why would I not as a pastor of a church or anybody I'm saying them out there me as a pastor of that church would not want somebody to come in and if my people if it if it brought your eyes this big and if it brought you saying Hey brother could you tell us that and and Hey Brother way could you bring that guy back again we need some of this oh buddy what H you know what happens is don't you Mr selfish pops up y you trying to steal my people no he's trying to preach the word of God I want us to make it I just want us to make it I don't care how we make it skin of our teeth so what we made it listen David the great king that had everything in the world he said said Lord just let me be a doormat just let me be a doormat in the house of God as long as I'm in the house of God just let me be a doormat and if you don't have that attitude God will place you somewhere all right you place yourself somewhere you're in trouble we've all tried every Christian every son every child that comes to God is Tried by what you're not tried by the devil that's not what that says you're Tried by the word see if you'll be loyal to it when The Showdown comes what decision are you going to make that's it and he that cannot stand chastisement but goes on with the world he's an illegitimate child and not a son and daughter of God that's why Jesus could look at those Pharisees and he knew they hated him they and they're the ones that killed him but he called him you generation Dev vipers you snakes John said it Jesus said it I'm of my father you're of another father that's pretty close and not a son and daughter of God certainly not now but the what spiritual minded catches the word not the natural minded person listen it's hard to come to church physically everybody with me it's hard to come to church physically you got to get some of you have to drive an hour hour and a half two hours maybe sometimes to get to this building right you got to get ready you got to take the dog out you got to take this out you got to fix something for in between Services I understand that but something inside of you ought to drive you to this church it ought to drive you to get here it ought to drive you what to not just get here for the formality but to fellowship with God in his people cuz we are sheep we have to be what we're herd animals we have to be together all right and I know it's hard to come back at 2:00 and I know we talk about being sleepy but but sometimes you got to fight it fight the thing take a knife and put it right here oh never mind we do pray for the sick we'll have a prayer line afterwards so bring something to clean blood up though cuz I know some of you is going to do that I know I ain't right but it's human it's it's our Humanity but fight it fight it to get something from God even if it's 15 minutes even if it's 15 minutes of what you listen to 15 minutes is yours and listen God knows you going to be tired so maybe he'll keep you awake in your spot till you can get that awake part and then maybe somebody else will get something while you're going to nod but look but the spiritual minded minded not the body minded not the flesh minded the what the spiritual minded catches the word of God lines up with it and what the then look let me let me paraphrase the spirit is Happy the spirit is happy to come down under the shed blood and take that person be a prisoner be a prisoner of God Paul a prisoner of Christ each one of us look what happened to the children in the Fier furnace they were a prisoner for a while do you know the image do you know what that image was that they refused to buy down to that was their buddy Daniel right Bel to Shazer oh wouldn't that work in the message today I preach anyway but I mean really look what that look what and that's what they're going to do to me and you they're going to try to crucify us for not following a man and you got to go to a certain spot to get it folks they know you certain spot you got to go to get the word of God but what did it do those of us that are being persecuted they are being tied they can't get out and preach because of what because of the reputation of this place of this church or of this ministry not the building but the ministry but what it should do it should deliver you you know what makes you stay home where you can teach the home people man but the only thing it did what it delivered them from the bounds that they were bound with it was a paradox sometimes in our own lives that Paradox repeat repeats sometimes you're brought to a showdown where you have to make a decision one more time you are going to have to make a decision there's a requirement to choose as a free moral agent you got to choose right and wrong right from wrong you have to stand on that decision like they did and it all works together for the good what did it do it never hurt them it loosed them amen sometimes we're caught in that position first thing you got remember the man drowning in the river you got to get the man out of the river before you can get the river out of the man same thing with here you got to get the devil out of the man come out and make a stand get the thing out cuz listen folks we do have those little foxes that still spoil the vine we've got those little things that still come about us and they're demons they're not just they're not just little floating no they're demons brother Ram walk into a place and he said he see them hanging in the rafters what demons ready to what dispute him you see what he was under that's why God had to give him a commission and told him said I'll be with you remember he said the ever failing word of God I'll be with you don't you worry about those demons up there and and like I said before somebody was saying about cancer you know there's a lot of people had a healing campaign but there's nobody touched brother Rand healing campaign especially when it come to cancer cuz cancer was a hard demon cuz brother R said the angel said he said he made it specific he said nothing will stand in your way now he could have just left it right there he said even cancer cuz at that time folks that was what 50 60 years ago cancer was just a word that meant death cancer death that was it didn't matter if you had a little spot on your arm or something uh breast cancer or different thing you were gone cuz there was no technology now thank God thank God that uh as somebody was saying the other day you know brother Brown prayed to God to for men to find a cure of cancer he was wanting to find a cure of cancer knowing that what that cancer is going to go everywhere right so now we've got doctors and we've got things that you say cancer now didn't brother Brown say cancer would be like a toothache before the end time like a toothache you say cancer now you got a lot better chance of survival than you did 60 years ago so God sent the great physician through brother brandham to get rid of that cancer drive that cancer completely out of their body stuff fall off on the platform a lady that weighed what what she weigh 70 lb 60 pounds remember Florence nil's sister or Florence Nale one right I mean you see the picture of her her legs were like this big around and dying of cancer and then 3 months later you see a picture of her and she's just ready to go go back to work she was a nurse or something but you don't see that now you really didn't see it then but you saw it through brother Ram's Ministry and now we have that same Authority now today folks he didn't take it with him we still should not fear cancer we still should not fear those words because you know what that word goes into your brain and it says oh oh oh you know and then you start thinking quit that thinking thinking it's just a word that man put on it it's all the devil it's all a demon and we need to talk to the demon talk to the sickness talk to the cancer not to the person all right look he's talking about letting it go he said that's the way it is anytime as long as you're going to do it in other words long as you project yourself someone talks to you and you talk back about them God can't fight your battle you're fighting it yourself ain't that what we do ain't that what we do amen we fight a battle that we should never be in give it to God just let loose and let him do it just commit it to him look the greatest weapon that I know of a Christian today is a committal you said no brother R said one time before the greatest weapon was Faith well put the two quotes together together faith is a committal to God saying God you got to handle this I can't handle it no more it's all yours put your kids in his hand but listen if he knocks them on their backside don't go running over there don't go running please don't go running and you know like brother Claude wer told me one time he said don't pray for him either cuz God will honor your prayer he said you'll take it off of them and God's got it on them yes he said you'll pray it off of them he said don't he said you pray for their soul you pray for God to have his will in the matter but not Lord Heal my son his his son was going through some really bad bad times and he was um a drug addict just got to commit it to God say God save his soul I'm really not worried about it that's what he was saying I'm really not worried about his life human part I'm worried about his soul if you'll save it soul lord well he did come out of it and and he's doing a little bit better now but you know people get caught in that he and Hannah was one my daughter she's in her late 30s and she went through that time of you say oh it ain't nothing to it yeah it is an addiction is an addiction I don't care if it's what you can name it whatever you want to it's an addiction all right and it's something you it's real something you have to fight and you have to let God help you do it cuz you can't do it on your own how many how many how many of you have been have done something like I was the I was the cursor and I was the smoking the not smoking anything but chewing the back and all that was what God had to take away from me all right and take that out same way with you you had a demon that God had to help you because there's no way you wanted to do it before because that Inside Man hadn't been changed yet but once that inside man got changed praise the Lord let that thing out how many times have I been telling you that let it out and we get to it that's what we're going to talk about so an Army first is getting ready for battle first thing's got to be what select soldiers you're selected elected right listen Delta Force um Marines were you a marine see there's a special people not everybody can be a marine right not everybody's going to be Delta Delta Force cuz they start weeding them out and you've got the what Elite of the elite well guess what that's what God's doing to me and you he's taking the elite of the elite you say what about my brother don't worry about your brother you better worry about yourself some soldiers they got to be dressed for fighting they've got to be trained for Fighting by what by fful Ministry and I believe that the greatest battle has ever fought is now ready to go into action we read this last Sunday I believe that God has been selecting his soldiers now listen a lot of us weren't born when did he preach this 1962 How many of you were not even born at that time shows you how old the rest of us are that's why you got to be dressed for fighting they've got to be trained for fighting and I believe that's the greatest battle has ever fought is now ready to go into action I believe that God has been selecting his soldiers amen I believe he's been dressing them training them and the Battlefront is now set getting ready to start now we know where it's at there had to be a place selected all right why was it selected in the mind all right we'll talk about it in just a minute there's a mutual ground look no man's land Satan took the what brain head God took the heart because we're going to read it here in a few minutes that out of the heart proceedeth all these things good or bad you said brother way what's this got to do with with the Statue of perfect man if we don't get this right if we don't let that what's inside of us out good or bad and either get rid of it or say look you know when you got a a battle the best way you have a battle plan you have everything set just right you have the ground right you have everything right but you better have a contingency plan you better have a backup plan cuz if so and so is supposed to act this way and come this way with his army and he turns around and goes up on the hill and comes around you better figure out what you're going to do real quick so don't you think Satan is what what he's the greatest apart from the mighty conqueror he's the greatest batt there is because God was the only one that defeated him right amen so you better be weary there's a Battlefront where they meet and test their powers where each Army test its strength against the other Army a mutual meeting place now don't miss this when that great battle started down on Earth he's talking about one in heaven it's one on earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to rage now look you don't have a battle if Satan's in your all come on look back when you were when you're not born again there was no Battle of Good and Evil oh you were trying to be morally good yes but you did Evil right you did Evil and you liked it it was good right but Chief me now born again me now have white dog black dog the Battleground which one Chief wins he said the one I feed the most he wasn't talking about losing his salvation he's talking about his walk as a Christian amen and that Battleground begins with the human mind there's where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of battle why because it's a neutral spot you say how'd that happen it's a neutral spot you you got here either Satan or or or or God not not not two we're not two Soul people and I'm saying heart because I'm I'm talking about this I'm talking about your we'll talk about in a minute your psyche your person who you are that's your soul who you are is the devil when you're born who you are when you're born again is God all right now then you take that and then right here is the Battleground all right Satan can't get to your heart your soul if you're born again but he can get to your mind because you're a human being you were born in sin shapen in iniquity spouse your mother's womb a liar you came contrary to the word of God Amen even though Jesus came the word of God he came the right way even though he came the right way Satan po po if you be the Son of God took him upon the temple and said I'll give you all this Satan must have been pretty comfortable in a church cuz he was on top of the temple he said I'll give you all this if you'll Bow Down and Worship me Jesus is like don't tempt the Lord thy God but where it was a decision he had to make remember brother Bram said the battle was fought in the Garden of Eden the battle was one in the Garden of Eden not at Calvary it was one at the there at Garden of Gethsemane when he said father let this cup pass from me if it be thy will let this cup pass from me but nevertheless what happened that thing that was inside of him took over that human and said nope I got to go because they need me I got Sons and Daughters of God inside of me and they've got to get out my attribute of Savior I got to go to Calvary my attribute of healer I've got to go to Calvary because decisions are made from the mind are the head decisions every decision you make good bad or indifferent comes from your brain everybody with me right everybody okay don't fall asleep on me it is warm up here I'm sweating a little bit where's Aaron when you need him I don't know who holds the f I know don't know what the future holds but I know who holds the future that's the main thing he holds all future and whatever mine shall be it's in his hand so each day I want to live not for myself if I live for myself I live a selfish life I want to live for others and give what strength I have not to myself and to my own pleasure but for the benefit of others that'll build the kingdom of God now that see you see where he was at he was showing where he was at I mean that's brotherly kindness he didn't care about himself he cared about his people then we know we quoted this a hundred times we're going to quote it again you have to suffer to rain suffer to rain all right the reason for this is that character simply never was made without suffering like I said before generals those fstar generals and fourstar Generals they did not get those medals by pushing a pencil at a desk 100 miles away from the battle no Patton Robert E Lee all the different ones they were in the heat of the battle and what they made decisions to win a war or win a battle made those decisions and those decisions what put them in a place all right there's Aaron Jr thank you Abby that's my niece blesser your face is red in case you didn't know that a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character satanic listen God can't give you power and you not be able to use it right cuz that's what the devil did he gave the devil power permitted power and look what he did with it he used it wrong but you and I though power with character is fit to rule who you you first right Blasphemous names look that's gifts of God he's talking about speaking in tongues different things but these gifts of God without these virtues so without these virtues what was happening in the churches without the these virtues they would just stand up we saw it the other day excuse me we saw it the other day there was one God out spoken tongues one one um interpreted and it wasn't a minute later or less than three sentences later somebody else jumped up and did it again then somebody else jumped up and did it again all right it was out of place it might have been of God but was out of place all right but if they would have had these virtues working in this life see that because it makes a stumbling block to the believer unbeliever it's not accepted by God this has to be first I believe he was pointing to that and when you have faith virtue knowledge temp PA god brother kindness then the Holy Ghost comes down and seals you as a unit the same as he seals the church ages as a unit the way way he makes his bride is the way he makes his individual made out of the same material like Eve was made out of Adam a rib from the side here's the thing that you have to have first you can't impersonate them he's talking about that you can't IM imitate them they've got to be what God sent and God born imitation only causes confusion all right everybody with me why am I against organized religion if what is purpose to the church the life that within Christ isn't reflecting in you don't you stand still if you haven't got patience virtue all these things Temperance godliness brotherly kindness all these things that are required so it's a requirement we know that let me say it again it was a requirement it's a requirement for you to grow as a Christian all right we were talking about it all on your head so let's read this I added these scriptures in just this morning so I want to talk about this just a little bit Psalms 94 says look in the multitude you have been sitting here today for hour and a half and there is a multitude of thoughts have went through your head good bad or indifferent oh no I've been listening to every word you're saying okay what day is our Christmas dinner that's what I thought December the 4th I wrote it down confusus said the shortest pencil is greater than the longest memory if you write it down you'll remember it when did you say that oh and the multitude of my thoughts within me they com thy Comforts Delight my soul David in the multitude of my thoughts Within Me thy Comforts Delight My Soul David was thinking about the word of God which he had the Torah he had the five books first five books of the Bible that's all he had he was writing part of it right here Isaiah 55 says let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our for he will abundantly pardon remember what brother Brown said he said they said brother Brown how can I keep these evil dirty thoughts from happening he said you can't H you can't keep the bird from flying over your head but you can keep it from making a nest in your head did everybody understand that because what we did was we still have this I'm going to say it anyway we still have some of the same thoughts we had when we were in in the world hello amen I'll say amen for you anyway but what do we do we don't entertain them cuz when cuz when we were when we were in the world we what oh yeah oh that beer be good today yeah yeah I'll just get me a beer I'll go and I'll go and uh and cuss this guy out or or run somebody off the road you see what I mean you might still have the same thoughts about you want to run somebody off the road that's okay just don't do it but what do you do you yield to what's inside of you the motivator that's what we're going to talk about just for a minute then we'll close let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon now God said for my thoughts that's what we got to turn to that thought my thoughts are not your thoughts all right so there's there's where it's at right here pull it apart neither are your ways my ways sayth the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts James 1 ver6 is but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord because a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways unstable a double-minded now double-minded means right there wavering uncertain doubting and divided in interest I think I should I think I should not the two the demon and the and the angel sitting on your shoulder divided in interest but now who wins the one you feed cuz that conscience that comes into into your conscience or into your thought it comes into your thought and what you either entertain it or you kick it out one of the two and you've done it I mean we're all we're all human beings but how many of you though have entertained a thought and never even come to pass never even come up that way never was done that way never was even never was even nowhere you thought you wasted your time thinking about all that oh I'm not the only one that does that we waste a lot of our time on negative thoughts I'll say amen for everybody in the building we waste our time on negative thoughts so brother brandom what do we need to do what's the recipe right mental attitude now the right mental attitude talking about the prayer line now you along here do you understand what I mean when I say the right mental attitude your right mental attitude toward God's Divine promise now it's toward a promise not toward anything well bring any promise to pass cuz look healing is not conditional that you're saved come on saying to this mountain be removed it's not conditional it's said if you say if you believe in your heart lay hands on the seat they shall recover now maybe you don't believe that you say well my faith is weak I wouldn't confess that see don't let the devil know that always say I've got good faith you say no you're lying no you're lying if you don't I believe God with all my heart see don't testify nothing of the devil when you accept your healing never act like you're sick or crippled anymore believe that you're healed take him at his word then it's all over on God then and not on you wow as long as you take God his word then the word will produce what it promised to do that's what I'm talking about you know we're talking about healing we're going to talk about healing we talked about healing of our soul that's a new birth right we're going to talk about healing now of our spirit realm memor re and conscious affection because that's where this is going to be is that right now have faith believing with all your heart queen of sha 1961 always remember Church God's words are true I believe the right mental attitude toward any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass look if you can look at it in the right way but remember he's been my standard in life I have tried to do this this is one I told you if you had a situation I read this the other day I'm going to read it again the first thing I want to find out whether it's the will of God or not if you need to if you need something from God today if we believe God sent a prophet We believe We he gave us life lessons also then I know it's God's will the next thing is my objective to it and my motive in doing it all right and my motive is right if it's the will of God my objective is right my motive is right I have faith that it'll be done because first it's the will of God and I have my objective is to glorify him and my motive is to give him all the glory I told you the situation about the brother in another church that said he was going to go to work on Sunday and get paid double time so he could pay the pay the uh send offering to the missions he was all right in two points but he missed the very first one the will of God was not for him to stay out of church amen so he missed it on the first one he might have got it on the second one second one or the third one sure he had a he had a motive take the money give it all to missions but he stayed out of church look he became spiritually he's a desert just now coming back to church been in church all his life because first it's the will of God and I have my objective is to glorify him and my motive is to give him all the glory what are you saying brother way that's right here what is your motive and objective is to know more than the next church it's to know more about God that's right and then let the other churches see that we're different I'm talking about denominational churches and churches in the message all right and my objective is to glorify him and my motive is to give him all the glory see so there's no selfish motive about it if you have a selfish motive it ain't going to work show us the father 1963 the word Jesus said is a seed that a sore sowed look and any gerti seed in the right kind of soil will produce its kind now look he's talking about being taped and it's going to be thousands are going to listen to it he just was prophesying I go on record I say this about the word of God being a seed if you can take the right mental attitude toward any Divine promise of God he will bring it to pass look if you can get yourself in position to believe that that promise was for you so you got it's a condition you got to believe that that promise is for you all right and God's going to equip us for the battle just a few things we know that so we see that it's a requirement all these things brother Donnie had to have shells and gun and and canteen and whatever else he needed that's what everybody that's what God the United States gave him what to go to battle with Oh Brother D you going out there in your skibbies and your and your T-shirt we'll bring you we'll bring we'll bring it to you when you need it no you got ready before the battle started cuz you knew the battle was impending you knew when the battle was going to be almost and you knew to get ready for it well same way with me and you we know the battle we know it's here we know it's to us an everyday thing show God's requirement how we can come to the perfect stature of a perfect man before God now we were talking about ad that word ad is not like 2 plus 2 is four right so what does it mean in the Greek lexican it means to minister Minister nourishment so add minister to your faith virtue you got to get it from a minister Minister unto to supply furnish and present add to be supplied ministered unto and assisted and as we said before this is a really good quote from the um Minister from the internet wasn't a message preacher but I like to quote a person of virtue makes the progression from knowing what is right to doing what is right amen but look he or she intentionally chooses what to say do in value you can either shut it off today and just just be born again and you can sit there and and people would just run right past you or you can say God it's all for me fill my cup Lord raise it up like sister barar some of y'all's cup never will get full pour it on me Lord well it's just going to run off that side but you raise them hands up guess what you made a cup and your head is in the middle of it drown me in you Lord because if you drown me in you I'm okay amen he or she intentionally chooses what to say do in value reaching beyond the good toward the best what brother R say he's getting the best soldiers ready all right in every situation a virtuous person knows what they have an opportunity that they have an opportunity to honor the Lord and reflect him to others and that's what it is right living for others and and virtue now not the virtue at the bottom but these are all called virtues these are the virtues of God so virtues mean moral Excellence value Merit meritless and worth active quality or power what power without what character it's satanic capacity or power adequate to the production of a given effect you got to come to the Statue of perfect man before that headstone going to come down on top it can't come down on the base it's got to come down on what somebody that's mature mature bride energy strength potency efficacy as the virtue of a medicine specifically this is it moral Excellence Integrity of character purity of Soul performance of Duty all right let's talk about this just for a minute and then we'll then we'll dismissal this afternoon CU remember your heart or your soul is the same thing everybody with me on that all right heart and soul is same same word in Bible ible and in our terms but now remember there's only Faith or doubt in that Soul all right let's back it down into the soul s right let's read this right here Matthew 15:1 17 just for a second do not ye yet understand that whosoever entereth in at the mouth goth whatever enter into the mouth and goes out the belly and cast out in the drought they were talking to about eating stuff and all that but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the man for out of the heart proceede evil thoughts murder adulteries fornication theft false witness blasphemies wow these are the things which defile a man but to eat with unwashed hands defileth not a man all right Romans 6:16 said no you not that to whom you yield yourself servant to obey his servants you are to whom you obey what you talking about the inner man whether of sin unto death or of obedience under righteousness but God be thanked that you were the Servants of sin but you have obeyed from the heart that form of Doctrine which was delivered unto you listen you were changed by by Doctrine I don't care if you were born again you were born again by Doctrine right you want me to prove it brother BR said Jesus's first Doctrine was you must be born again first Doctrine you must be born again let's get that Doctrine right I believe we're to the place we can get that Doctrine right that you have obeyed from the heart that form of Doctrine which was delivered unto you being then made free from sin thank God God ye become the Servants of righteousness I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh now he's not discluding the flesh you got it it's here today most of you with your eyes closed I hope you're praying for me look for you have as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity this direction even so now yield your me servants to righteousness and Holiness and I want to read the definition and then we'll stand and musicians can come the word Greek word is cardia where do you think we get Cardiology everybody with me cardia Cardiology what of the heart but look here's the definition I want you to read this or read it with me denotes the center of all physical and spiritual life so we know there's a physical heart but there's also the heart of an apple right so there's you can say heart different ways but now watch this it separates it the center and seat of spiritual life the soul or mind as it is the fountain Fountain what's a fountain a fountain has to have an original place where water begins then it comes up and it goes out right so there's an origination of a fountain there's a place where it starts it doesn't just start out in the air and start spurting water no it's got a place down here that it starts from what your soul it is the Fountain and Seed of the thoughts passions desires now the seed is not where you do it but it's where it begins everybody with me thoughts passions desires appetites affections purposes Endeavors of the understanding the faculty seed of the intelligence as a man thinketh in his heart so is he not up here down here of the Soul so far as it is affected and stirred in a bad way or a good way are of the Soul as the seat of the sensibilities affections emotions desires appetites and passions or the middle or Center or innermost part of anything even though in adamant which is the core of an apple or the heart of an apple or the heart of a pear or the heart of a peach everybody with me all right let's read what Jesus said about this oh Generation of Vipers how can ye being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of your fountain the mou speaketh a good man out of the good Treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil Treasures bringeth forth what evil things so I wrote myself a note it affects your senses which is what memory reason conscious affection imagination you've got one sense in the soul an originator a fountain somewhere where these things start where your thoughts begin your thoughts don't begin up here it begins in your who you are all right then it goes up to what Fountain of memory reason conscious imagination affection it all just spurts out from that middle that's why the inside guy has to be changed listen your source of water had to be changed didn't that Jesus said said how can bitter water come out of a good well how can good water come out of a bitter well what you talking about the well of you let's stand to our feet The Well of you out of the heart will prede these virtues but you've got to let them go through what the filter of your mind that's what we're going to talk about the filter of your mind in your memory your reason your conscious effects and Imagination but remember as God is pushing up this way even if you're born again as God is pushing up this way with water so is Satan taking something else and coming this way with it and where do they meet they meet right there memory reasoning conscious imagination and affection that's where it meets and that's where the Battleground is and we'll talk about let me read this right here I'm going to read it back this afternoon now listen brother Brown's talking about dying naturally but didn't we have to die spiritually first so let's read this as dying spiritually now the only thing you do when you die you just change those five senses Glory you just receive another sense amen think about being bornn again and you're alive with a higher sense now he's talking about somebody dying going into the sixth Dimension and your senses are expanded let's talk about being born again here I want my senses expanded here not over there I want a grow in Grace and knowledge here I don't have I won't be growing over there and you're alive with a higher sense thousands of times higher than this in another life a life where there's no death no sorrow the things that you don't know nothing about now you see it plainly when you cross there didn't you see don't you see things plainly now you don't have to see over there in the sixth Dimension you see them now we see them plainly by what by the word of God and I'll read the rest of it later on but there's your it affects your senses and the fountain you start with whatever your water is bitter it's going to what produce bitter memory bitter reason ing bitter Consciousness bitter imagination and bitter affection you're just going to be the bitterest person in the world cuz you bitter at everything you bitter at everybody you don't have no joy you don't have no peace you know why because you clog your flu up cuz that fountain down inside of you is joy peace longsuffering all those different things and it's wanting to push itself out but what we have a filter in the greatest battle remember brother Brown preached a thinking man's filter a thinking man's filter I want my memory to be toward good I want my reasoning the Bible does say and we'll talk about later come and let us reason together all right my conscience we need to have a clear conscience right and what we still have a clear conscience if you get the brotherly kindness and you don't have a clear conscience you're not going to get brotherly kindness I believe brother brandom had a clear conscience to man because he never had anything to say bad about anybody if he did he's already forgiven all that I'm talking about right at the end he said I have no bitterness no G no bitterness toward anybody I'm not going to talk about these people anymore I'm not going to call these people retas and Ricky Lord You've condemned me for that I'm not going to call that anymore man he came to a place that he had his memory reasoning conscience his imagination and affection was all turned toward God more than to me than anybody on the face of the Earth outside of Jesus Christ at that time all right but why did he preach it to me and you so that he could tell it about himself no remember he was not selfish he gave this so that we could have it and then God helped him open the seals so that we can see where this is coming from we can see what Fountain what what memory is supposed to do we can see that we had a we have a soul then we have a spirit and then we have a body we're trium being and he knew these senses were going to be affected by what's deep down inside of us that's why I said before folks you're going to produce whatever water you got inside of you is going to burst forth whether you want it to or not good or bad bitter you seen people just bitter why be bitter why be bitter well somebody did something to me Jesus how many times do we forgive them people that cut me off the road on the road 70 times he said no 70 * 7 and then more if you need it I said that's 490 times we've never got to that spot have we that's what I thought we're heading there though where you you get to where you look at a prophet of God he was a prophet he knew those people didn't like him he knew those people were going to talk about him he actually probably was projected into their living room one day and they didn't know nothing about it and God let him hear what was going on cuz remember what he said he said those ministers are going to challenge you on water baptism right so and so's going to be sitting here you're not going to have the place so and so's going to be sitting here this one going to be sitting here and you won't be able to get the to get the hall and when he told that brother the brother said brother Brown we already paid for it well guess what it happened exactly the way brother R said happened and he knew them 300 preachers but with compassion he preached that sermon not bitter to nobody he could have called them vipers he could have called him Snakes in the Grass and knew that it was the truth but yet he said them 300 ministers are going to come down and get baptized he knew they wasn't going to but he gave him a chance he gave him an opportunity to turn that thing around but he knew that's way the same thing with God God knew the children of Israel was going to hate him he knew they were not going to go to the promised land yet he treated them just like his children he gave them
