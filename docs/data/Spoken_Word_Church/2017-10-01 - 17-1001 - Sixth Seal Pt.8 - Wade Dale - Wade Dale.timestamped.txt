[0:00] I figured you could i we're on the steak
[0:05] seal this will be the last part we do
[0:07] for them for the time being and since I
[0:10] got two of the people in here what I've
[0:12] decided to do let's think about
[0:13] yesterday yes the next two Sundays
[0:16] Ryan's going to do Sunday school class
[0:18] the next two Sundays after that bottom
[0:20] of this let's go claim that way we're
[0:22] going to get to the sixth seal and I'm
[0:24] gonna take a little break down here
[0:25] we're gonna have to back up and start
[0:27] upstairs so I don't want to keep
[0:29] trudging along here but the 6-2 is a
[0:31] good place to stop does that seal is the
[0:35] tribulation seal that's the the seal of
[0:39] redemption redemption is over after the
[0:41] sixth seal is open that we know of here
[0:46] because it's a little tricky to say that
[0:49] all redemption is over on the sixth seal
[0:51] which it is because the sixth seal
[0:53] carries us all the way through to the
[0:56] micron judgment but the sixth seal opens
[0:59] here on earth to put we're in a rapture
[1:04] the church is going through the
[1:06] tribulation 144,000 is being called out
[1:09] and then the Battle of Armageddon and
[1:11] all nature is to be done away with all
[1:15] right that we know because remember
[1:17] we're going to come back into millennium
[1:19] and it's still going to be days times
[1:21] not dark I mean that day okay am i
[1:26] understand i might listening now nobody
[1:29] knows what they're talking about
[1:31] all right so this sixth seal and you
[1:46] know if we do which we won't if we do
[1:49] because remember remember Brethren says
[1:53] in the future home he says the
[1:56] Millennium in the sea drones to
[1:58] different things some things will fit in
[2:00] the Millennium they won't fit in a
[2:01] future home something to fit
[2:03] Blin cause remember and amylum there is
[2:05] still time Satan is bound the Devils are
[2:08] still alive they just can't work through
[2:10] the bride thereby all right with that
[2:12] one okay
[2:13] but he's still there but now I'll
[2:15] promise you if anything was to happen
[2:17] they would be enough sons and daughters
[2:19] of God there to stop it before happening
[2:21] okay just like eating because that's
[2:24] what programs that an eating condition
[2:26] has begun in the Millennium it doesn't
[2:29] end until the future huh
[2:30] because remember there still is time in
[2:34] the Millennium we still have time there
[2:36] I got that but this sixth seal finishes
[2:43] the redemption of man finishes the
[2:45] redemption of the earth and eventually
[2:47] the redemption 144,000 finishes the
[2:49] redemption for the well I guess you say
[2:56] the force I'm sorry the foolish virgin
[2:59] because they died with a testimony but
[3:03] they have to stay dead for a thousand
[3:04] years foolish person dies in them and
[3:08] you're an accumulation they have to stay
[3:10] there that then the Dead lived not a
[3:15] thousand years that's right it is
[3:24] blending into that time hmm
[3:26] because the 70 weeks of Daniel X why
[3:28] it's so important to bring down
[3:30] incorrectly the 70 weeks of Daniel is
[3:34] that when that dream has your message
[3:36] gets finished that's all there is to the
[3:39] Jews but now the world has got to be
[3:40] renovated that sixth seal continues
[3:43] because it's the tribulation seal it
[3:45] continues into where everything is
[3:48] destroyed everything is destroyed but
[3:51] now like I said before when we come back
[3:53] here in the Millennium they're still
[3:54] going to be building you don't say once
[3:58] and it's a nuclear war that's gonna kill
[4:00] everybody but the buildings will not be
[4:03] annihilated now that the Battle of Gog
[4:05] and Magog to go into the future home
[4:07] this is going to be wiped completely off
[4:10] you'll never see one speck of any of
[4:13] this but I believe in
[4:14] you see if you you see how the devil
[4:17] works in the mind of man all these
[4:20] movies of this post-apocalyptic world
[4:23] well that's basically what you're going
[4:25] to see but the evil is not going to
[4:26] carry open to the light we're just going
[4:28] to step back onto this earth and this is
[4:30] going to be just a wasteland but what
[4:32] because remember we have to build houses
[4:35] Tamil says we build house now wait up
[4:37] but whoever is left here 144,000 they
[4:40] got a built in temple gotta build it
[4:41] with something okay
[4:47] Ezekiel 42 44 gives yous dimensions
[4:50] gives you what they build it with and
[4:52] all that stuff okay so so we're not
[4:55] looking at and just walking into you and
[4:58] I listen you and I walk into a utopia on
[5:01] this side when we get a body thing
[5:04] okay so we're way ahead because we've
[5:06] got to be ahead we fell first so we've
[5:10] got to come back to the condition
[5:13] because we caused this to happen we cost
[5:18] the six elope the sixth seal can't open
[5:21] until we're gone like I said we're
[5:23] holding this whole thing up
[5:25] but this nature cleansing of you and I
[5:28] has to come before any of that okay
[5:33] Kalista see this frame stuff you have to
[5:36] watch this now because we have to put
[5:38] this we have to overlap because right
[5:40] here is a body change if that this is
[5:42] the rapture seal but we take a a body
[5:48] change but this right here tells us how
[5:51] it's gonna happen go back into the sixth
[5:54] seal it'll tell you how it happened and
[5:57] remember too that we're gonna read it
[6:00] here but I was reading a little bit what
[6:02] the Prophet said we may really have time
[6:04] that the sixth seal opens in a
[6:07] three-fold matter just like the seventh
[6:08] seal up which number one is what they're
[6:12] calling out of the 144,000
[6:14] all right then it's something else and
[6:18] then something else all right
[6:19] got there so if it opens in a three-fold
[6:22] matter and the trumpets that's why this
[6:25] thing is so
[6:26] layered on top of each other the
[6:27] trumpets all the trumpet sound under the
[6:30] sixteenth okay
[6:32] that's how mysterious it's not just it's
[6:34] like I was telling you all the other day
[6:35] you gotta be you gotta watch what's
[6:37] going on
[6:38] it's the seals been broken off but it's
[6:41] that unwritten part that you and I have
[6:45] to read because what we have to do is
[6:48] about completing together there's
[6:49] nowhere in the Bible it says that the
[6:50] fifth seal Jew is where the ones killed
[6:55] under Ivan the hill because most other
[6:57] commentaries tell you this this is the
[6:59] bride or the chosen right so that's what
[7:02] brother Brennan thought crying how long
[7:04] how long but then when he comes to the
[7:06] fifth seal and it opens he sees that but
[7:09] he doesn't just see that he's if you
[7:11] open we're gonna get into this why need
[7:13] to stop hearing that fifth seal you see
[7:15] the word grace about a hundred times in
[7:16] that sermon grace grace grace well
[7:19] that's the grace seal the grace given so
[7:23] the grace of marriage and divorce was
[7:24] given under the fifth seal opening to me
[7:27] and you you hear that opening to me and
[7:29] you doesn't give Israel a right to have
[7:32] a marriage and divorce okay because you
[7:34] and I have to have the grace of marriage
[7:36] and divorce for the body change so you
[7:39] see how this how this comes back and
[7:41] gets us the Seventh Seal brings him to
[7:44] the earth so when it's a one seal brings
[7:46] him to the earth all these seals open to
[7:48] me and you first we get that's why I say
[7:51] we get the we have been chosen to get
[7:55] the spiritual part of this whole salmon
[7:57] sea okay but it's good it's open
[8:01] naturally but what that's the single
[8:05] part the one I showed you didn't want
[8:06] the seal but now that part that was
[8:07] rolled up that's the thunder when that
[8:09] thing opens then I was reading last
[8:12] night brother Graham said one seal will
[8:15] tire do you copy
[8:16] tie the entire Bible together well you
[8:18] can see that more now than ever
[8:20] okay how that this afternoon we're gonna
[8:23] we're gonna blend in to just even on the
[8:25] foundation we got to go back to the
[8:27] messenger coming to the end of the age
[8:29] what we've been preaching for years how
[8:32] that there's eight manifestations of
[8:34] doctor the church ages brother round had
[8:36] coming
[8:36] the age he couldn't come at the
[8:38] beginning to the end but now his message
[8:40] came at the beginning of the earth but
[8:43] not but not his message he came on the
[8:46] scene and then his message began we'll
[8:48] talk about the offenders
[8:50] well if those you just got here starting
[8:54] next Sunday I'm gonna take a break for a
[8:56] month or so so I can fall back if I keep
[9:00] talking about this y'all gonna know more
[9:03] than everybody else knows and I'm just
[9:06] gonna stop right here this is a good
[9:07] place to stop on this thing Steele just
[9:09] stop right here called everywhere you
[9:11] see remember I told you there was one
[9:12] two three four five six and there's an
[9:13] arrow six the the sixth chapter
[9:17] revelations is six seals then it goes
[9:19] into the what revelation 7 which is two
[9:22] calling out of Israel right then
[9:24] revelations 8 breaks the seventh seal
[9:27] right then you got the trumpets in
[9:30] Revelations 9 stop these revelation 10
[9:33] comes in and then the seventh trumpet
[9:35] breaks the chapter after so there's
[9:37] always an arable there and watch how
[9:40] brother branham even preached six seals
[9:42] had questions and answers and then the
[9:43] seven preach six church ages and then
[9:46] you come in with ten virgins and you
[9:48] know there's a break there there's a
[9:50] rest time because remember God created
[9:54] the earth it's hot in here
[9:56] God created the earth in six days and
[9:59] then what he rested there was an arable
[10:02] thanksfully erased it so what we're
[10:04] gonna do is we're gonna riff back up and
[10:06] do the and trying to get it upstairs
[10:10] so next two Sundays Ryan is going to
[10:13] ditch things two and then the two
[10:16] Sundays after that Bob's going to do and
[10:18] then the two Sundays after that the
[10:21] Lisa's going to okay then we'll get
[10:24] Bella showing them some here
[10:27] I'm gonna give them two in a row that
[10:29] way if you get on Ceres and you know we
[10:31] might do great things so we'll see
[10:33] alright so but I'll be right here
[10:37] cheering them on
[10:39] but see I'm saying I'm having to think
[10:41] six seal down here and the foundation up
[10:43] there and it's okay but I don't think
[10:46] you get the full I want to be at my best
[10:50] so I want to do you know the most
[10:52] impactful is that and I want to give
[10:55] these guys some times but y'all hear me
[10:56] all the times that maybe one time now
[10:58] I'm going to kind of give you a month or
[11:00] two them to listen to them because we
[11:04] are even lluís bringing wings do not
[11:06] lend them and you know that just I told
[11:09] my brother clothing okay then we should
[11:12] we truly have a five fold ministry you
[11:14] need all five oh okay to some teaching
[11:18] is boring okay just tell them I saying
[11:22] teaching is boring but what happens is
[11:24] you bring in some violet Louise her Bob
[11:27] they're growing but they bring in a
[11:30] little spark in it kind of like the you
[11:34] need a little what is he doing I
[11:37] guarantee you popular kids are Aryan his
[11:40] eyes first they happen to that I pop
[11:42] open doing like this okay so maybe we
[11:44] need a little you know what do you feel
[11:46] Jonah
[11:47] wake up we're in the end time we're in
[11:52] time we have a message that way I hope
[11:55] y'all got that I mean Louise brought
[11:57] that out well so take the underlying
[11:59] take the onion peel oh that was for Joan
[12:04] we have a message that we remember
[12:08] brother Graham freaks running that's
[12:09] what brought my attention running from
[12:10] the presence of the Lord
[12:11] yeah are trying to do how to service
[12:13] ended up being as well you be out of
[12:15] these will you have a message and it
[12:17] just perfect but you can be out a little
[12:19] good but he took what Louise was talking
[12:24] about even on the ship never thought
[12:27] about that my life smart as I am like
[12:29] brother don't say
[12:31] that him being on that ship he witness
[12:34] to that group of people and they went
[12:36] home to Joppa and said look what
[12:38] happened to us there's a prophet among
[12:42] us here
[12:43] and that's what happened because you
[12:44] watch brother Branham preaching these
[12:45] different places he went to spending on
[12:47] North Carolina a little hole in the wall
[12:50] place weapon 2,000 people in the in the
[12:53] whole community and got Henry green one
[12:56] man all right right he goes to this when
[13:00] he gets one who does the making the
[13:01] Palmers and the one you know you have to
[13:05] see that that God's leaving because of
[13:07] these places because their seed there
[13:08] that's right there's children there that
[13:10] needs to be talked to
[13:11] now maybe 50 years until somebody sees
[13:15] it but still it's like Jonah Jonah
[13:17] planted to see God planted the seed
[13:19] through Jonah Jonah was a witness even
[13:22] when he listened even when he was in his
[13:24] error he was a witness they there was a
[13:27] profit on the same because you know
[13:29] they've gotta think off man if God
[13:31] thinks too much of this guy even though
[13:34] he may be out of the will of God if we
[13:36] three motor board and now the wind just
[13:38] quits and the storm just quits they some
[13:41] powerful going on there so I really
[13:43] enjoyed that because it it brings
[13:45] another layer just like these seals
[13:47] brings another layer of what God has for
[13:51] us then I don't think we're seeing but I
[13:54] think there's something happening in the
[13:55] church I don't I just Archer got my all
[13:58] around
[13:58] people talking we're talking about
[14:01] things that they've never talked about
[14:02] before and people coming in and
[14:05] listening and getting a blessing from it
[14:08] so but let's finish this seal so Ryan
[14:11] has got next Sunday on the next the
[14:13] eighth and the 15th
[14:14] it'll be on the calendar up here boxed
[14:16] up at 22nd and 29th and then Lewis
[14:20] well I'm gonna I'm gonna be at immune on
[14:23] Saturday the 4th of November and I'm
[14:26] staying over to that Sunday and being
[14:28] serviced with them
[14:29] somebody have to do them if I thought
[14:31] the least about later now I'm will be at
[14:32] my goal due to week of Thanksgiving so
[14:35] our Sunday after Thanksgiving we'll look
[14:39] we'll get it all straight now yeah we
[14:43] get it all straight down so now we have
[14:45] not read this but I want to read this
[14:47] where brother branham brings in the
[14:51] sixth seal in Matthew 24 it says
[14:55] immediately after the tribulation of
[14:56] those days now brother Brown makes a
[15:01] comment on the sixth seal he says that's
[15:02] the minor tribulation this is not this
[15:05] is not going to happen after the major
[15:07] population this is going to happen
[15:09] triple-eight tribulation of those days
[15:11] all right which is 144,000 to do I can't
[15:17] ever remember the the book is first this
[15:23] burden is going to be in a tribulation
[15:24] big time they're gonna be hunted down
[15:27] til millions of them's gonna be killed
[15:29] for the gospel of Jesus Christ okay so
[15:32] being you got 144,000 is going to be
[15:35] persecuted during that time so that is
[15:38] more of a pre-tribulation a brother
[15:39] Brown called it a minor tribulation
[15:42] period so this is not the tribulation
[15:46] that's going to destroy everything this
[15:48] is the tribute after the tribulation of
[15:50] those days shall the Sun be darkened and
[15:54] the moon shall don't give her life it
[15:56] stars shall fall from heaven and the
[15:57] powers of the heavens shall be shaken
[15:58] then we'll read revelation 6 and then
[16:01] shall appear the sign of the Son of man
[16:02] in heaven then shall all the tribes of
[16:05] the earth mourn and they shall see the
[16:07] Son of man coming in the clouds of
[16:09] heaven with power and great glory he
[16:11] shall send His angels with a great sound
[16:12] of a trumpet and they shall gather
[16:13] together his elect from the four winds
[16:15] from one end of heaven to the other
[16:19] now that's not us we're already gone
[16:22] okay but now remember there's a remnant
[16:26] called the foolish virgin and 144,000
[16:31] that's still going to be here now the
[16:33] sign of the Son of Man was what
[16:34] resurrection
[16:35] son beside of the Son of Man is the
[16:38] resurrection son if I got a brother
[16:41] they'll taught it for years son of man
[16:43] is it is a science son of man is their
[16:46] sign that the resurrection is back but
[16:48] brother Bryan would be preaching and
[16:49] people would be raised from the dead
[16:51] same way we've seen people here do to
[16:55] prophets they're gonna see the sign of
[16:57] the Son of Man
[16:58] what 144,000 gonna take a resurrection
[17:01] two prophets you're gonna take a
[17:02] resurrection in front of the whole world
[17:04] right because he said all the tribes of
[17:07] the earth mourn and they shall see the
[17:09] Son of man coming in clouds cause he's
[17:11] gonna come and get them because remember
[17:13] your denominational world thinks this is
[17:15] their rapture okay see you see how the
[17:19] Satan has has diluted the word but we
[17:24] had a prophet come and put the cow down
[17:26] eating grass I mean they got the guy
[17:29] right they got the cow they got the
[17:32] grass and they got the tree but they've
[17:34] got it all convoluted to where the cows
[17:35] up in the not a pretty picture but we
[17:39] see where brother Adam brings all this
[17:40] ice wine through the Prophet took the
[17:42] Prophet not to rearrange the work man
[17:45] rearranges the work right brother man
[17:48] never rearranged the word to fit what he
[17:50] thought that's right that's what man has
[17:52] done they rearranged the word to what
[17:54] they think when our brother rounded he
[17:56] rearranged the word by the mind of God
[17:58] he didn't rearrange the word he took the
[18:00] revelation the true revelation and
[18:03] brought it back to where you and I can
[18:05] see for sure until there was a man told
[18:08] me one time he's I'll be glad when I see
[18:09] the Son of man coming he's quote a
[18:10] district with power and great glory I
[18:14] said it says after the tribulation of
[18:16] those days shall the Sun be darkened I
[18:18] said when did your God coming because
[18:22] remember all denominations believe that
[18:25] we have the good loot emulation all
[18:27] denominations believe that the bride the
[18:29] bride not just to church that the bride
[18:31] goes through tribulation which was like
[18:34] I said before that to me that's a great
[18:35] revelation to know that brother man told
[18:38] us that the bride if you're warning
[18:40] doesn't matter if you go by the grave
[18:42] them after they burn your body standing
[18:44] in the street you are going in the
[18:46] rapture and you will not have to go
[18:48] through any of that tribulations alright
[18:51] so that to me that's a great thing
[18:53] because because see that scare tactic
[18:56] that the denomination is used Jen's been
[18:59] there so everybody's been there oh you
[19:01] don't want to go you know we got to go
[19:03] through this tribulation we gotta give
[19:04] her a life and we're good
[19:06] no we're done we're protected to me
[19:09] that's what this seal shows this seal
[19:12] shows that I get my cleansing here and
[19:15] then efficient tribulation seal I'll
[19:18] call out of that the seal has done hey
[19:22] listen this we are going through
[19:25] tribulation right now all right
[19:27] your old nature is fighting you v me
[19:31] last night at one o'clock in the morning
[19:33] fighting me her kicking me but but you
[19:41] see it's the warring in my members Paul
[19:43] said and that's something that we've got
[19:45] to it's kind of settle down to where it
[19:47] doesn't matter what kind of thought
[19:49] comes in your mind that you just turn it
[19:51] away because Jesus was the same way hey
[19:54] the thought would come to his mind and
[19:56] he just turned off that's so simple but
[20:03] he hit it so hard
[20:04] I don't know if are a few but heart mate
[20:08] because you know what that thing follows
[20:10] me you trying to get away from that
[20:13] thought the best thing that there is is
[20:15] my brother Ram said just start singing a
[20:17] hymn or just you won't read the body and
[20:20] sometimes I don't and I apologize but
[20:22] sometimes autograph allow them to start
[20:24] reading but then sometimes I've drowned
[20:26] in my own pity so
[20:31] not a lot of oil everything's fine
[20:35] Tom's 37 I will read that but a stone
[20:44] accommodate folks when this nature
[20:46] cleansing will happen to a group of
[20:47] people and they will take a body change
[20:49] their body will be so perfect so pure so
[20:53] like the way there won't be one smell of
[20:56] sin and that's before all this happened
[20:58] naturally so we get that revelation of
[21:03] these seals really they're really not
[21:05] listening there really is only six seals
[21:08] that has something attached to them
[21:14] right I read the quote last night
[21:17] brother man he said really because 60
[21:19] look talks about all this stuff this is
[21:22] gonna happen this is gonna happen this
[21:23] going to happen this don't happen
[21:24] revelations that one said they silence
[21:26] in heaven for how about then there's
[21:30] nothing else programs we don't have
[21:33] anything else to go on
[21:34] but text said what ceilings him he's
[21:36] running ties all this together if that
[21:39] mighty angel in Kimber one doesn't come
[21:43] down and reveal this just like he did
[21:47] with the property whatever cool look
[21:49] good just like you did for the Prophet
[21:51] then we're gonna miss it the seals were
[21:56] not just for William Brennan the seals
[21:58] were broke so that you and I can get it
[22:02] all right all right so that we can be
[22:04] caught up in Emily well reading this
[22:06] afternoon every way we were having a
[22:10] Bible study at my sister's house on
[22:12] Friday and there was a lady there that's
[22:14] her friend she's denominational we were
[22:18] talking about that why some some will go
[22:23] in the restaurant some won't but will
[22:25] they be lost you know so I was telling
[22:28] them I said well you know even in the
[22:30] nominations they they're probably
[22:32] they're gonna get eternal life at them
[22:35] but they're gonna have to go through
[22:36] this cleansing that's right I said but
[22:39] now the bride she's already went through
[22:41] judgment because Jesus Christ was to
[22:44] involve the judge and then and all that
[22:45] and I said but see because we have our
[22:47] trust in Christ and and but now you take
[22:50] a Catholic for example their trust is in
[22:52] the Pope or in Mary and use a technology
[22:55] of purgatory night but you and I play
[22:57] right so they're still thinking judgment
[22:59] I still think that you know and in the
[23:01] girls I've never seen it like that you
[23:03] know that but the denominational people
[23:08] are hungry yeah just talk to him a
[23:11] little bit because there's something
[23:12] listen so long they've been into this go
[23:16] to church same three hymns preacher
[23:18] preaches 30 minutes they don't like him
[23:20] two months later they kick him out get
[23:22] them a new one you see one come on very
[23:25] unsettling you brother Brown said that's
[23:27] what would happen and very black and
[23:28] white for example exactly you either go
[23:31] to hell or you get you're doomed or your
[23:36] glorious one of the table but we see the
[23:41] sea is so simple is always less five
[23:43] wise and five foolish virgins virgins
[23:47] this right there in the word they're
[23:49] virgins to the Word of God they're not
[23:52] manhandled
[23:54] the virgins been men him yelling that
[23:56] one coming a virgin a virgin is a virgin
[24:00] until she's been handled by something
[24:02] about by someone else then she's not a
[24:04] virgin anymore but these were five wise
[24:06] and five foolish they had kept ourselves
[24:08] from something but they never went all
[24:10] the ways to get the oil then we're
[24:13] blinded by false shepherds so they just
[24:15] are listening you're free moral agency
[24:17] will kick in any time and you think well
[24:20] I got it and that's what a lot of people
[24:22] you you look at their life and you don't
[24:24] see an experience in their life and and
[24:26] you think wow you just sending a message
[24:29] Church good you can quote you know but
[24:36] when God comes down and shows you
[24:37] something and put something together for
[24:38] you and it just thrills your heart
[24:41] that's never the devil devil will never
[24:44] give you joy in the Word of God he'll
[24:47] give you doing everything else but he'll
[24:49] never give you joy in the Word of God
[24:51] that's the one place that Satan takes it
[24:53] to that's why you know brother I'm
[24:57] saying you know he said if you keeping
[24:58] your mark he said Satan won't be able to
[25:00] get to it he said but if you speak it
[25:02] that's why I said what still silent
[25:04] silence and devil for space well half an
[25:07] hour and we'll get into that later down
[25:09] the road but we're still on the
[25:12] foundation we got to get a few more
[25:13] things on the foundation upstairs before
[25:15] we get to this but now let's go through
[25:17] this real quick and we've read that now
[25:20] let's read revelation
[25:25] six and you'll see we're seeing is
[25:31] actually the same thing now the hill we
[25:34] had opened the sixth seal though there
[25:36] was a great earthquake Sun became black
[25:37] we were indirectly just read that South
[25:39] o'clock tea though nothing like I stand
[25:42] before upstairs the Steel's have already
[25:44] been preached man has sealed it up and
[25:49] staple something else brother Branham
[25:52] was breaking the seal off of that that
[25:54] the devil had put on it that's why you
[25:56] see that that white horse rider is
[25:58] Antichrist but he's going away from you
[26:02] can't stand revelation that's what
[26:03] program said Satan cannot stand
[26:05] Revelation so when that seal was being
[26:08] broke there but that little prophet was
[26:09] tearing that seagull off the Christ oh I
[26:13] got one quote I'm gonna save but he's
[26:15] talking he said my message and he
[26:17] stopped immediately he said it's not my
[26:20] message it's his mess he stopped right
[26:22] there he said he's the people believe my
[26:24] message that's what he said believe my
[26:26] message and he stopped and he said no
[26:29] it's not my message is his mess you see
[26:31] how probably you know you and I were
[26:33] just four feet we broke this our head
[26:34] would be this big we'd be it had to come
[26:38] to brother and it had to come that man
[26:40] they had to fit his character it would
[26:42] have fit no one else or getting one do
[26:43] you want to come through that like this
[26:45] amen same thing with you and I you we
[26:47] must see all of us you messed it
[26:50] everybody we must see that we're called
[26:54] for a duty and a job and it's not to
[26:57] wander off here there everywhere is to
[26:59] stay in your job do your job and do it
[27:02] to the best of your ability when you see
[27:04] that then what when you see who you are
[27:06] then your people gonna see you later
[27:08] right cuz there's army if you're
[27:11] wandering around like most people in the
[27:13] message they wander over there and then
[27:14] wander over there brother round called
[27:15] wandering stars they wonder whether this
[27:19] is right they wonder whether the damage
[27:21] their new lease is right they all the
[27:23] seals and bro bro bro
[27:25] 19:53 because some years ago he told the
[27:31] sail off so that you and I can get
[27:33] something out of this Yeah right amen
[27:36] it was a great earthquake some became
[27:38] black as sackcloth of hair and the moon
[27:40] became blood and the stars of heaven
[27:41] fell unto the earth even as a fig tree
[27:43] casteth her untimely figs when she is
[27:45] shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven
[27:47] departed as a scroll when he rolled
[27:51] together and every mountain and Island
[27:52] were moved out of the places and the
[27:53] kings of the earth and the great men see
[27:56] I parallel in with Matthew 24:24 give me
[28:00] and the kings of the earth and the great
[28:02] man the rich man the chief captains and
[28:04] the mighty men and every bondman and
[28:05] every free this is everybody hid
[28:07] themselves in the dens and in the rocks
[28:09] of the mountain said to the mountains
[28:10] and rocks fall on us and hide us from
[28:13] the face of him that sitteth on the
[28:14] throne and from the wrath of the Lamb
[28:15] now who is the son of man but something
[28:19] God's not the Lamb of God he is but he's
[28:23] not in that position it said you can see
[28:26] the Son of man coming in the clouds of
[28:27] heaven well the Son of Man is the land
[28:29] that's me the Son of God is the father
[28:32] figure the father the one sitting on the
[28:34] throne that the Lamb the son of man took
[28:36] the book of Proverbs had to be a human
[28:37] thought they would bleed and he took the
[28:40] book a lamb can't take a book so they're
[28:43] symbolic here so you see it hide us from
[28:46] what exactly when it said in Matthew 24
[28:48] Jesus told the son of man will be coming
[28:51] in cloud with great glory and they're
[28:52] gonna see him in right there it's
[28:57] exactly right
[28:58] behold the lamb of God who takes away
[29:00] saying the world now he wasn't looking
[29:02] at the Son of God
[29:03] he was looking at the Son of man it's
[29:04] time physically you understand
[29:06] physically the Son of God was inside
[29:09] there but he was in the manifestation of
[29:11] the Son of man that's why the
[29:13] manifestation of the Son of man has to
[29:15] come back in the end time God brother
[29:17] branham has to say behold the Lamb of
[29:20] God that takes once in the world just
[29:22] like that John did he stood and said the
[29:24] same thing here all right that's my
[29:28] revelations v is so important and see
[29:31] there's your gap watch this there's your
[29:34] seven Church ages right revelation 1
[29:38] two and three are interchanging right
[29:40] that's why we got to come out of the
[29:42] church agent John for one what we're
[29:44] caught up right
[29:45] revelations five comes immediately in
[29:48] once revelation 6 the only of the sale
[29:51] so there's the interval or the gap for
[29:54] that breach that's modeling brother
[29:56] Graham preached the breach it was
[29:57] Revelation chapter 5 it was a breach
[30:00] between the church ages and the seven
[30:03] seals we'll talk about this effort again
[30:05] a little more for the ones you see
[30:07] something man if you you know where do
[30:10] you know I really don't care what you
[30:11] believe about breach and breach because
[30:13] I see something out of it cuz I went
[30:15] back in the birthday and I started
[30:17] reading the birth pains and I thought
[30:18] man I ain't never read this before never
[30:20] read that book I read it a hundred times
[30:23] by never not really but see that's where
[30:29] it's supposed to be
[30:30] that's like brother William that comma
[30:35] is two thousand that that one's not but
[30:38] what his illustration was that comma was
[30:40] two thousand years
[30:42] something happened that comma in two
[30:46] thousand years is that comma see didn't
[30:48] mean I see eternal Word of God because
[30:51] everything is put in there exactly the
[30:53] way we need yes all right
[31:01] that is great that is great right the
[31:09] Son of God is spirit dog okay you're
[31:12] back out there that is the whole ego
[31:13] misread son of God son of man son of
[31:17] David wish that we went just went
[31:19] through that you know right about a year
[31:21] ago the Son of God is what the creator
[31:23] that wasn't Jesus in human flesh back
[31:26] there but that was Jesus Christ oh the
[31:29] Bible says it was just right when he was
[31:31] in the Son of God form a spirit man okay
[31:36] but then that spirit God comes down to
[31:39] the church I mean down yeah well they
[31:40] had Church ages in the Old Testament you
[31:42] know that don't you
[31:43] okay then they did they had turned ages
[31:47] in the Old Testament brother man said
[31:49] they did he pulled him he put him round
[31:51] one Anita to me and watch John the
[31:53] Baptist coming in the settlement church
[31:57] age so that was still the Old Testament
[32:00] John the Baptist coming in the sandwich
[32:02] earth alive just showing up again
[32:04] - what introduced the head that'll be on
[32:12] the lines of ministry back on the earth
[32:14] to introduce the headstone same way
[32:17] right here same thing happen down here
[32:19] same thing happened up here all right
[32:20] everybody got that yes okay listen God's
[32:24] word has a continuity good if you'll
[32:26] just get in it get away from all this
[32:28] other stuff just get in it he does
[32:30] things and it's a pattern right that
[32:34] pattern just keeps going and keeps going
[32:37] because the first Elijah couldn't be
[32:39] different from the last Elijah because
[32:42] they're going to introduce the head the
[32:45] heads Christ will read it this afternoon
[32:47] well no I saved that from that sentence
[32:50] but because we got to come up to where
[32:53] brother Browns message is in two parts
[32:55] just like I showed you on the time but
[32:58] right in here is that revelations five
[33:00] that's not another Holy Spirit that's
[33:03] the that's the total sealing of the
[33:05] person because remember the revelation
[33:07] is five that carries us all the way
[33:09] do the body change because they sing a
[33:12] new song redemptions over when the lamb
[33:16] tastes above brother brown super dancing
[33:18] over that's why people can't understand
[33:20] that he's not saying redemptions over
[33:22] for the whole world he said Redemption
[33:23] over for you right nobody got that
[33:26] mm-hmm that's why say you got that's why
[33:29] I won't take it slower because there's
[33:30] the layers that you just keep peeling it
[33:32] I love onions and now let you just sit
[33:35] there and peel them off there but you
[33:37] know watch the same onion you hold it up
[33:39] look through it and you see the next
[33:41] layer you know take that layer off all
[33:43] right all right everybody all right so
[33:45] this is your state like this is the
[33:47] sixth seal but this has to happen to you
[33:50] this has to happen in a spiritual form
[33:53] it is to me it is a tribulation and it's
[33:56] going to get worse for us not better but
[33:58] it's gonna get better no worse
[34:04] thank you it's gonna get worse because
[34:08] the devil listen easy got everything
[34:11] else brother branham I was reading last
[34:14] night
[34:15] he says Satan's our serpent seed is
[34:18] taking over the world that was 1962 he
[34:22] said circle is in spoken words written
[34:24] see he said son this serpent see is
[34:26] taking over the world there's not much
[34:27] more of God's seed level that was 1964
[34:30] because remember it's all gonna be in
[34:32] the minority we're gonna be a little bit
[34:34] of grip the darkness dealing with but
[34:36] guess what as God's dealing with us
[34:38] guess who else is gonna be there
[34:40] Satan's gonna be nice and he's going try
[34:43] because listen this is his great last
[34:45] this is his this is his Waterloo for
[34:49] here but remember he said he's very
[34:54] persistent and consistent because he's
[34:57] gonna watch us take a body change yes
[34:59] he's gonna watch a step-over another
[35:02] dimension and then he himself is going
[35:04] to make sure all this comes back comes
[35:07] remember during the two prophets that
[35:09] Satan is incarnate in a man called the
[35:11] pub and he's going to save that Eve just
[35:16] like when he incarnated the beast in the
[35:18] garden and deceived that one but see
[35:20] he's incarnated in that beast and he's
[35:22] not going to save us but we don't God's
[35:25] protecting this second Eve because you
[35:28] know what the second Adam didn't make a
[35:30] mistake there's not gonna add them did
[35:33] not sell us out he actually bought us
[35:35] back came in that's actually you that's
[35:37] where you revelation that's where you
[35:38] Redemption come from my husband bought
[35:41] us back so we're like you said we're
[35:43] mrs. Jesus Christ or whatever he gets if
[35:46] he has sustained judgment so do i but if
[35:49] you don't have to stand judgment
[35:57] we're allowing our husband on our
[35:59] headship which is Christ that's my
[36:03] brother Brown said you have a head which
[36:04] is your husband he said but if your
[36:06] husband don't follow Jesus Christ he
[36:07] said you follow Jesus Christ right and
[36:09] that's what he said you follow Jesus
[36:11] Christ that's your ultimate if you're a
[36:13] Christian now don't be foolish
[36:16] you know Christian everything goes out
[36:18] to go you know how imagine divorce
[36:20] coverage you don't have no coverage at
[36:22] all you're not a Christian you're out
[36:23] from under the blood you just standing
[36:24] there you're just like this that's why
[36:28] the new person most important thing
[36:30] because it covers you
[36:31] it covers everything and then you decide
[36:36] by your free one way to see how far you
[36:38] go that's right but you're definitely
[36:41] going to be you're sold already in that
[36:44] divine love because when you receive a
[36:45] new birth that is very love all right
[36:48] but the outside man because when he took
[36:51] that book he didn't take that book just
[36:53] of our soul that was the person that was
[36:57] the person that he bought you and I he
[36:59] bought us that same person no by saying
[37:03] I mean he bought your body at Calvary
[37:06] your not your literal body was Baltic
[37:09] Albertina right the sanctification under
[37:12] that seal right there was when Jesus was
[37:15] hanging on that cross and he said
[37:17] remember brother Brent said his blood be
[37:18] old on the earth your body was in the
[37:21] earth mm-hmm those who he has justified
[37:24] he has already in God's mind
[37:30] you're already glorified actually in
[37:32] God's mind you never fail yes what Sam
[37:36] do you talk no I'm in the flesh but not
[37:44] the one God saw a man run my life
[37:48] Genesis 1:26 man is so important I must
[37:51] look to that as McKnight's me whether
[37:54] you say if you or not it's me that one
[37:56] man that he made there was in a multiple
[37:59] form that was me that was me you had to
[38:02] worry about you but that was me
[38:04] that he for
[38:07] created form to be what come form now
[38:11] you go over to Polly's is conformed to
[38:13] his image will never look like Jesus
[38:16] Christ but now you don't look exactly
[38:19] like your mom and day yeah
[38:20] you have great but you're an individual
[38:24] so we all are an individual but we have
[38:26] the DNA of God running through it not to
[38:28] our natural veins that's no no we don't
[38:31] have right no but we will when we talk
[38:36] about it it won't be mom and daddy blood
[38:39] normal it'll be God Almighty in another
[38:43] form called the bride now how can he
[38:45] judge his self that's right you can't
[38:48] he cannot judge yourself he hears our
[38:52] voice remember through the blood we'll
[38:54] get into that a little bit later on
[38:55] Redemption he hears our voice even a
[38:57] Christian because in these bodies the
[39:00] Bible says Fleck this flesh and blood
[39:02] will not inherit the kingdom
[39:03] that's right okay this is dead stuff
[39:06] that's right this will be have to be
[39:09] what changed even though if you go by
[39:12] the grave it's gonna have to be changed
[39:14] into his image which is just to me it's
[39:18] just more and more of we got to go
[39:20] through this you and I gotta go through
[39:22] tribulation right now because the sinner
[39:25] did anything Bobby I'm not worried about
[39:27] right now I'm worried about everything I
[39:31] did anything but there's gotta come a
[39:33] time before you settled some things some
[39:36] things you you know you got to kick him
[39:39] out old nature has to die that's right
[39:43] like I was telling you the other day I
[39:45] was talking to a Christian man bless his
[39:47] heart he just didn't get it he's in the
[39:49] message but he said he said I divorced
[39:52] my old husband and I took on Jesus
[39:54] Christ I said no he's gonna be dead
[39:59] start preaching listo
[40:01] yeah they died me damn he played me the
[40:06] war do you paint the war
