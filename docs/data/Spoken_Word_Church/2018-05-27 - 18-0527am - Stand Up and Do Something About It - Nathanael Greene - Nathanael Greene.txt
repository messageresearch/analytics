given him a name which is above every name and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is the Lord to the glory of God the Father it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of

makes you a little bit easier there's a little a little nervous but well we'll press through get rid of this I'm already getting hot if you'll just bow your heads with me word of Prayer dear Heavenly Father God counted a privilege and an honor to stand behind this sacred desk this morning God and just be able to relate to the people what you've put on our heart Lord we ask now that you come down

your bride today Lord we thank you for it in Jesus name we pray amen you have your seats for just a few minutes I'm gonna kind of like a background if the Lord will help me most of you know my dad and my grandpa and the gifts that's in their lives and on their lives and I kind of guess it was inevitable that it would fall upon me and but believe it or not I'm not I'm not used to not be the sweet Nate green that I am today I was quite rebellious quite attitude know at times and and just just I ran a long time brother weights been there he knows most of us have been there yeah it's it's hard being a pastor scary preacher's kid in general and you have that that spotlight on you all the time and you have to have to be on your P's and Q's when you're around people but it's a different life at home and I just I think the Lord that he they put a did a change in my life didn't work for me and and I'm not saying it wouldn't happen but it wouldn't happen without that little sister back there that that uh that come and kind of kind of set me in my place and gave me gave me an ultimatum you know I'm not gonna give him a whole testimony because it'll take up too much time but pretty much we were engaged to be married is this about 2015 I we were engaged to be married and that summer sister Kaitlyn had had enough and to the point to where it I was getting so bad that I was scared when I was you know bus cider for nothing and everything and uh the Lord really put it on her heart to kind of tell me to back off a little bit and we're gonna have we're gonna take a break and we're gonna we're gonna see how this goes just pray about it and and heard going to brother Ron's Church and me being best friends with brother Andrew that he was kind of our mediator at times and she was caller or he would call her and kind of give her some encouragement and then I would call him and pretty much break down and cry and and kind of tell him I don't what you know I don't want to lose her and he to the point he told me he said I wouldn't be mad if she left you this is just to put it bluntly I wouldn't be mad if she left you I would encourage it matter of fact because you're not where you need to be and she's trying to live right and she's wanting to start this family with you eventually and and if she doesn't break it now than it'll be it would be worse down the road so I got to the point of desperation I prayed I cried out to the Lord mom and dad prayed and I'm sure other people have prayed and I got to the point to where I didn't want to run anymore I didn't want to I didn't want to sit back on my haunches and just say well I'm a Pratt I'm a pastor's kid I'm I'm good to go you know and then turn around and cuss somebody out you know I've been there but I got desperate before the Lord and we were at camp meeting this 2015 the last night of camp me know some of you were later remember brother Ron preached and preached hard and after the service he was getting ready to come people up for prayer and he told me after the service he said I saw a lot over you and he called me out and said tonight is your night so men sister Caitlin walked down to the to the platform to get prayed for we were going as a couple but somehow we got separated brother Ron come to me and there's several other brothers come and prayed prayed to prayed with me prayed for me and all I remember in the prayer before I kind of fell out all I remember it was Satan this man is going to defeat you from behind the pulpit many times and that that's all I remember after that and then she was screaming everybody was coming the Spirit was it was unreal that night and that that night no one the same person I'm still not perfect let none of us are but from that night on I was a changed man and then he he kind of man he the next the next month we always tried to go up to their Labor Day meetings and he pulled me to the side he said I want to talk to you a little bit he gave me some encouragement and told me how to go about starting to study and starting to to gather thoughts and and just seeking the mind of the Lord for this Colin that he's placed on my laughing and he said I want to be your mentor because your daddy can't do it not that he can't do it but he don't want people to say well he's just preaching because his daddy's a preacher because both his grandpa's were preachers you know so he said I want to be that that mentor to you and he's been a real mentor and brother Wade and brother Sam have as well just watching their ministries and watching watching other ministers that I look up to and and just watching how they yield their selves to the to the Collin and to the spirit it's a it's a it's awesome to have friends and family that I consider these brothers and y'all family that that I can come to and confide in and to help me out when I when I need it or have a question or anything and so I got to I got to that point to say to kind of lead into what I want to speak on this morning I got to the point of I had to fight for what I wanted I had to I had to train myself to yield myself to the Lord to be in this position to where I can accept him to where he can come into my life and change my life and I'm gonna ask you to stand now and read the scripture I won't be too awful long this morning I'm sure you will turn your Bibles to Psalms 144 and also Philippians 4:13 you say a man when you got him blessed be the Lord my strength which teeth teaches my hands to war and my fingers to fight my goodness my fortress my high tower my deliverer my shield and he and whom I trust who subdue with my people under my feet the Philippians 4:13 it's a very familiar scripture I can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me and you can have your seats this morning I want to speak on stand up and do something about it now many times we find ourselves in the midst of a battle I know everybody has battles everybody has trials and tests we find out whether that battle be spiritual or physical or mental looks like brother Branham said the greatest battlefield is in the mind the greatest battle ever fought hmm this seems more times than not that there's no way through it you're not gonna win you're not you're not gonna you can't see the light at the end of the tunnel but we know that God is our way maker we know that God is our strength as the scripture said we know that that he's there to lead us through no matter what no matter how bleak no matter how dark the circumstances that he's there brother Brennan says in there in the resurrection of Jesus and the great climax is at hand the great warfare between the devil and God is going on and the scene is being set for the final front lines where the where the clash will clump and God will reign and rule for the Lamb was with them overcome them for he's the Lord of lords for the king of kings and he will write down every opposition a man now us as Christians and trying to live in this world and trying to to be of this world we're not of this world we just have to live in it we have to fight daily we have to fight for our lives every time we go to the grocery store we have to fight you know we have every time we walk out of the house pretty much we're not in our sanctuary we have to fight we have to find out we have to make sure we have our blinders on make sure that we're not doing you know just a me anything that's unpleasing to God and thing that's going to hinder our walks now I read this morning excuse me I want to I want to try to bring out and forgive my folly but Bible says through the foolish foolishness of preaching souls were saved so I want to bring out a heavyweight title boxing match I want to kind of break it down for you and and tell you how that goes and kind of relay it to our spiritual walks this morning yeah the first the first step in a in a boxing match would be the promotion stage would be where they tell everybody that there's going to be a fight they printed the newspapers they printed in social media they do they do everything and there's there's a lot of ads in this newspaper right here there's there's there's ads for everything and but we're gonna speak on the ad the telling us that the fights coming 2nd Corinthians 10 and 4 for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds he's gonna be there to pull down those walls when we can't do it when we can't when we can't get break through the wall when we can't get over the other side we can't jump over ourselves he's gonna pick us up in peace over the wall he's gonna break down the wall the brother branham says in the conflict between God and Satan God knew this great warfare was coming on between right and wrong and he knew what the enemy was going to do he'd know just exactly how to equip his people so if we notice the first thing the very first thing that God equipped his children with was being infinite he knowed what it to defeat Satan anytime anyplace anywhere on any conditions there's several scriptures that I have here that are advertisements for that fight telling you that it's coming and telling you to get ready job 14 and one man that is born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble so that tells us that we're gonna have troubles that tells us that we're gonna have heartaches and trials first Peter five and eight be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walking walketh about seeking whom he may devour he's always on the prowl I always trying to always trying to find somebody who's broke down who's not strong and spiritually not not where they need to be and he'll sneak in there and try to bring him down excuse me the next the next the thing there's several components to this is the training and conditioning each fighter like rhoda me and brother Wade were talking last night brother brother Muhammad Ali he he trained he trained religiously and he always knew what his opponent was going to do he always knew when to duck and when to weave and when to Bob and they have each fighter has their own methods and on condition on ways of conditioning their bodies to get ready for the fight Ephesians six verses 12 through 17 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against the principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places where for unto you wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand in this evil day and having and having done all to stand stand therefore your loins Girt about with the truth and having the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all take the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God now we know that the word stand means to get ready it means to stance yourself to get ready don't know understand hearing that come at me don't you know you're gonna get a knock on your rear end in other words but stand stand to be ready be ready to fight because once he starts throwing those punches he's not going to stop he's not gonna wait on you to get ready they said back the scripture says gird your loins that means they rolled up their skirts and tied them off so when they got ready to run into battle they wouldn't trip them up it wouldn't slow them down that's what we have to do today we have to get in the word and gird ourselves and get ready to get ready to to fight because he's not going to tell you that when the fights coming he's not going to tell you when he's going to come attack you it's just gonna happen it's gonna be right there many fighters they study their opponents they find their strengths and their weaknesses and how they move and when they're gonna go this way and go that way and brother Branham says in the contest is one of my favorite quotes he talks about six-second Smith think of this Smith is now now training for a contest is just like a boxer his enemy excuse me that's the wrong quote but we'll get to that one in a second that this one's good too now training for a contest is just like a boxer his his enemy that he's going to meet out there in the contest to fight a real good fighter usually knows then studies his opponent he studies his licks knows where he fights for or whether he leans forward hangs back fights right-handed or left-handed he studies all this and then if he's if he's a good smart fighter he gets him a sparring partner at a fight just like his opponent that he fights for he'll know all of his licks when he gets to that place and I think that's a very good thing for Christians to do that that's right and now if you want to start training start with John 3:16 the golden rule start right out with that and that'll get you on the floor and then train for the for the knockout punches because you're going to have to use them everybody knows that you you have to train to hit your enemy and always God uses his word we must remember that God uses his word to defeat his enemy if God could think or could have his give or could have give his people anything better to defeat the enemy with he would have done it he gave us everything we need he gave us the tools it gave us the the gloves that we need he gave us the outfit and you know the ring to practice in that's that's why we come to church that's why that's why your pastor preaches come to church be here when the doors are open and sorry brother that that's not in the notes but that's that's where we come to Train that's where we come to get fed that's where we come to to to to get stronger now read brother Brandon was talking in the quote they're getting a sparring partner that's the next the next step and there's that quote I was referring to says when I first started training for boxing before I got in professional fighting there used to be a trainer they caught him six-second Smith the first professional fight he had he whipped the man in six seconds and when I started training that man liked to killed me he knocked me knocked me plumb out of the ring and everything else and I was skipping ropes and running seven eight miles every day and taking all the training and I said six why do you have to do me that way see I said you just knocked the breath right out of me man when I went plumb over four ropes come right out of there and amongst them chairs and like two broke my back on them he looks laughed and said that'll do you good I said do me good how can it do me good you're about to kill me they said look Billy I don't care how physically fit you are your body's got to be able to stand it come back right quick if you take a hard punch said if your body's not used to coming back you'll lay there and take the county sit but if your body is used to taking it then coming back every time you hit it that shocks the blood runs back to the heart said if you'll do that then your body is used to coming back quick when you get knocked down brother branham snapped his fingers on your feet again see and said that that don't mean a thing when you get knocked down up on your feet again quick said you hate me now but you'll appreciate me when you get out there in the ring and that was right you'll appreciate these men of God that come and stomp on your toes and and and say things you don't you think we don't like to hear the things that you need may not be the things you like to hear just like when you're sick when you were a kid and your mama gives you this nasty awful medicine you don't like it but it makes you feel better there's there was two instances where where God could where David could prove God would help him defeat Goliath it was practice fights that David had it's barn barn fights practice practice rounds he had the lion and the bear that that he he defeated those that God put him into training so that he'd be able to defeat Goliath when the time was right and we come down to supplements and vitamins some of you know about it fighters they take vitamins and supplements to help build up their muscles and and their stamina and help them focus and and there's there's promises and medicine I'll through this by this medicine cabinet right here it's the best medicine ever there's there's there's so many so many supplements and don't even need a prescription for him just open it up and read it brother Blaine Lawson's sister she went through the message and counted out all the miracles all the excuse me she counted out all the visions in the message that come to pass and that's a that's a strong feat in itself just to sit sit there and listen to all the messages and and figure out what was right and have to go back and listen to it again to make sure you got it all down right but she come up with eight thousand eight hundred and eighty three visions in the message not the one just the ones that were on tape that the Prophet had that come come to pass and we're in the but we all know that there's eighty eight hundred promises in the Bible so that's that was a non comparison and that we don't have need of anything we need vitamins for spiritual strength just go to the medicine cabinet if we need an antidepressant just go to the medicine cabinet if we need something for we need a word just to encourage us about a loved one that may not be where they need to be it's in the medicine cabinet there's there's a gospel for everything Hebrew 6 and 12 says that ye may not be slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises brother Branham says again in the conflict between God and Satan now he wouldn't say I'll give them something here and then a few years later I'm a study out something better to give them and then after a few years later like we in military force the old bow and arrow and sledge and rock hammer and then the next was after a bow and arrow come musket and after the musket come to Springfield and now it's the atomic weapons and things say we keep growing more God always gives us what we need from that time but God at the beginning gave his children the atomic weapon because he's the infinite God now seeing where there was going to be a conflict and there was going to be a battle god equipped his children with the right kind of ammunition right kind of an attack excuse me the right kind of everything that they had need of that would sweep them all away from Eden to the rapture what was it it was the word the word that's what defeats Satan is the word it'll defeat him anywhere any place now why don't we why do we want to substitute something else when we've already got the best thing that there is the word that's there's there's nothing else but brother brother wait ask me when I left the house this morning you got your battle axe with you and he already knew what I was going to speak on this morning but I said yeah I got it don't go anywhere without it you know no one don't know when you'll have to whip it out and cut the devil's head off the next step leading up to the fight it would be the press conferences many times the two fighters will get together and they'll kind of hash it out talk about it talk about their expectations for the fight talk about what they think is going to happen and how they're gonna react to the opponent when it when he tries to come after them and stuff and there's some times that it gets a little heated they start talking smack to each other and getting nose to nose and wanting to start to fight right there and many times that's what Satan does he sits right up here and says you ain't good enough you're going to me you ain't gonna do you ain't gonna do what what you think you're gonna do you're not you're not good enough you have you have you ever the devil ever told you that there's a just me he he gets he gets on me quite a bit tells me I'm not good enough you know me just starting out preaching and everything and I know he is and that's that's when I take him to the word and show him you know show him what's what and who to tell him I got the best trainer in my corner we we try it we'll be finding that that too when during the press conference before the crucifixion before Jesus was crucified when Satan come to him Matthew 4 and tried to tempt him and God don't back down hey don't back God's children don't back down it's like I said we got the best trainer in our corner sometimes they have to hold each other back though they have to get their trainers and stuff to hold them back and and keep them from jumping on each other before the fight and then they there's times when when I was out in the world and stuff that people would look at me the wrong way and if I had been for some of my buddies holding me back that'd probably be behind bars somewhere cuz I was I never got into any fights but I wanted to fight a lot we come to we come down to the weigh-ins there's several weigh ins that leads up to the fight to make sure that they're where they need to be if they're not too big like me you're too small or they're just they just got to be just right and that's what we got to be is the bride to go to go home we got to be just right oftentimes like myself we find ourselves out of shape what's round is a shape but that's oh we find we find ourselves out of shape spiritually out of shape physically and well they the same can be said for us as Christians like I just said we let some problem or circumstance weigh us down too much yes sir and Hebrews twelve and one says wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with such a great cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us we can't run with follow I don't run anyways but we can't run with all this weight on us we can't run with all the weight on our shoulders and we can't we're not like you said when I took my jacket off can't fight with a jacket on you got to take stuff off to be able to move to be able to to dodge the fiery darts as I read earlier to dodge the smack-talk and the devil sitting on his shoulder just flick him off and keep going what you're doing and the ruin brother said the other night at home he said when you find out water who you're fighting then it's time to fight now as now comes time for the main event the moment you've been training for the moment we've we've been going to church for all these years the moment we've been waiting for it's time to fight it's time to time to stand up for that problem that you have your time to stand up for that deliverance you need for a family member for yourself time to stand up to get that depression off of you that that evil spirit that's been hanging around it's time to stand up and tell it where to go when that bell rings we have two choices we can either run and hide and we can fight they call it at work when I work security and they call it the fight-or-flight response either you fly and hide or you stand in fire and they want you to stand the fight as a last resort but I'm telling you somebody's coming after me I'm gonna stand there I don't I don't want to be the one to run away and hide I want to stand and fight for everything that's within me brother Branham says and God talks to Moses look I'll give it to you the lands over there but before you get there you've got to fight that's what's the matter with people today they're afraid to stand and fight what we need is and I'm assuming this is a song that says I must fight if I should rain increase my courage Lord must must I be carried home to heaven on a flower bed of ease with while others fought to win the prize and cell-cell through bloody seas whew me know I must fight if I must ring that's right he says we're when when it comes time to them to introduce the fighters you know the crowds getting amped up getting getting pumped up in the Devils just already in the ring waiting on us to come out he's just standing there yet and he had trained to lead like some people that don't come to church and then and then come in and say you know preached me happy I'm ready to go home and that's what he'll train one time and then sat down on the couch and ate tater chips and everything and wait on us to to come after him like we're gonna come after him we don't go cooking for a fight he does because he knows in the end who wins he's read the back of the book just like us but he's just sitting around this waiting and all of a sudden he hears that music Amazing Grace coming from the bag and he starts getting a little little antsy he starts to kind of straighten up a little bit and look through those doors back there and see see wait they'll come see Sam Dale coming to see Jesus coming and they share to hear the music Amazing Grace and everybody starts chanting Jesus Jesus Jesus there's there's no other name that has as much power as a name of Jesus it's like just like the song said earlier there's there's no other name that that can draw a crowd that can that can strengthen somebody just just just saying his name and the devil's just backing up and just just kind of watching and he's starting to shake a little bit he's a little nervous like I was last night when brother Sam said you're preaching in the morning yeah he's starting to shake and back up and kind of cower down as brother Ron says boo devil every time he says boob devil he gets smaller so that when they introduced Satan everybody was saying boo you know except for his little crowd over in the corner they were always a bunch of groupies you know there and as we enter the ring to fight for that problem that we have we have he's not he's not really looking at us he's looking at the trainer behind us he's looking at that who we represent who's behind those who's in our corner he's looking to to see what is he doing here why I wanted to fight them not him why why is he then when when the bell rings to fight now we're we're in the heat of the fight right now many of us are in the battle right now in the middle of a battle we feel like we're getting that rear ends wore out and fair like we'll feel like there's no hope there's no there's no chance of us recovering no chance of us coming back but just just keep pushing through cuz we know like I said we know the end of the book we know we know who wins he may win a battle now and again but we've already won the war brother Branham says in the contest he said Oh surely see there you come just that much surely you won't die but God said you would and that settles it and that that broke the great tug of war then and pulled the whole human race in the death because he listened to a reasoning against God's Word now it's now it's a shame that she did it but it's done past now we're still fortified and that link was made up with me in Christ Jesus we know that God gave us our best defense just simply trust his word don't reason with the devil that's what he does when he fights you he reasons with you your brother Donnie you're not you're not getting what you need you're you keep praying but you're not as nothing's going to happen you know there's there's no sense in wasting your time praying there's no sense in wasting your time coming to church you know I know I know everybody has that battle we think they might good enough to be a Christian am I good enough for the Lord you know and there's there's times where he almost wins but then you remember what you read in the in the Bible what brother Branham said John 3:16 for God so loved Nate Greene that He gave His only begotten Son and that just that just lifts you up and builds all your strength back to fight a little more push through and don't let don't let him know you're getting tired meaningful many fighters they they make that mistake of showing their their tired showing their getting weaker their they're not where they were they was at the beginning of the fight but don't don't give him that inch that he needs to take that mile oh all of a sudden we're getting our second wind we're getting ready to start fighting again we're getting ready to start putting them on the ground we've we've read we've read the word we got those vitamins we took a break during the intermission or whatever and we've got our feet under us again after being knocked to and fro and just being pretty much blindsided that we we've come to the we've come to the realization that we still have some fight left in all of a sudden the tables have turned and now we're whaling on him one brother told me after I prayed I preached this to home a few weeks ago he told me he said you could also refer to that as a tag-team match when you get tired just tag Jesus in and I bout shouted all he told me that during service he was leading song service and I said I thought of that but I didn't come out but I saved it for next time you start you started hitting him with those combinations start left and right left and right he hit him with the first Peter 2 and for 2 and 24 left hand then you come back and hit him with a excuse me in my notes guys messed up hit him with that mark 16 right hook tell him then you can finish him off with by his stripes I'm healed uppercut it's there's there's so many combinations that you can throw at him that back when I was a little kid we'd play video games and stuff and and we'd have cheat codes or combinations that would match sin and stuff and then we automatically kill the other guy or beat him up he's mostly fighting games and that's probably where my attitude came from by the end he's down for the count and he's not gonna get back up the referees already counting him out he's not getting back up he'll be he'll be back to fight you another time but this time he's not getting up you've won that fight and you've collected that prize that that healing or deliverance or that that back slid child that you've been praying for word now now it's time to celebrate now it's time to claim the victory celebrate now when you go back to the locker room afterwards and the coach is talking to you the trainer he's he's saying you did a good you put up a good fight you you you won you really proud of you showed your training today you showed what you've been working for and he asks if there's anything else he can do to help you start the next fight and I'm gonna read this quote here I told you I wasn't be long I tried to hold it out for brother Wade so he wouldn't have to a hard time this evening but but I'm gonna read this quote here from identification in 1964 now sometimes faith is unknown to you you got it and you don't know it if you try to push yourself into something and you miss it you go over the top of it it's so humble and simple see and here's the high priest that can be touched by our infirmities then if you touched him he would act like he did before is that right now watch now this this is awesome right you see this woman sitting right down here I don't know the little soul she's just sitting there but somehow she is in contact with God because in the dimension that I'm now looking in I see the woman and she's conscious that something is going on she is praying for her children who was not here that is right I don't know her I've never seen the woman but she was deeply concerned about some children do you believe me to be his servant do you believe that Jesus Christ is here the Holy Spirit who you see if we can get ourselves out of the way see now to heal you I can't see or give you or to give you your desire I can't see that has to come through God unless he would tell me to tell you something now but if he can reveal to me what's the matter with that child or whatever it is you you will believe me to be a servant you will skip on down says yes the lady has three children she is praying for and all three of them is shadow that is they're not Christians they're unsaved that is right one of them is a girl and she has a sore on her leg up high that's right isn't it wants something wrong with her eyes one of the boys another one has got heart trouble and as an alcoholic that's true is that your desire is that what you want from God the sister says amen then I ask in Jesus name that he gives you what your desire is do you need anything else man when I heard that like in about shouted all through my office that's that's how awesome my god is that's that's how awesome my trainer is do you need anything else to help you with the next fight but you need anything else that's like sister June when she cooks you breakfast in the morning or supper and evening let me go this round when she cooks you supper in the evening and you get home off that Miller out and she's got your clothes laid out on the bed for you take a shower and put your pajamas on for the evening and she's got supper laid out on the table and you eat and you're sitting a recliner read a newspaper or whatever I know that don't happen in my house either but but she asked is there anything else I can do for you there's I mean this month still in training we have been married now she'll get me after a while but that's alright she's she's a preacher's wife now but is is there anything else that I can do for you is there anything else that God can do for you today there's there's nothing no requests no no thing that you can ask that's too big for too small for God like the like the like the the story goes the man went up to heaven and he sees the conveyor belt with all the small boxes going and going down to earth as a bunch of big boxes stacked up in a corner this is what are the what are the little boxes for and the angels tell them say that's the people's request that's what they've asked for they're sending them down to him he said well what does the big box is for us she said those are the the angel said those are the big the big problems the big circumstances that nobody ever asked for because they think they're too big for God don't don't think anything's too big for God don't think any fight any problem any any circumstance that you may face it's not too big for my god if if your God ain't doing it try mine there's there's there's nothing nothing that my god can't do that's we've we've been made more than conquerors through the blood of Jesus Christ only and and that's that's all it takes is just that blood to to cover us and we can defeat anything we can defeat any foe that the devil tries to throw against is any problem it may take a while it may be a long battle but just think during that battle you're getting trained you're getting you're getting like like brother branham said in the quote when you're getting punched and getting the breath knocked out of you you're you're learning to withstand everything that the devil can throw a throw at you and I pray that the words been a blessing this morning it wasn't long but for short notice that was but the longest I've ever preached thank y'all for allowing me pulpit god bless you we believe it right it's a battle but the battles
