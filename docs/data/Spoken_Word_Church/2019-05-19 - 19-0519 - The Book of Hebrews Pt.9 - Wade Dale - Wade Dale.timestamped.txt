[0:00] [Music]
[0:04] okay all right
[0:33] not everybody remembered the you
[1:08] remember the riddle y starts out on four
[1:11] legs and in the middle of this life but
[1:15] has two legs and then the end of his
[1:17] life has three legs
[1:18] Oh a man a human human starts out
[1:23] crawling on four and snow for the feet
[1:26] and the legs are crawling they stand on
[1:27] two feet here in the end of them during
[1:29] their life and at the end of the limb
[1:32] now walking and up that's all right
[1:37] I didn't mean how it would Bob is gonna
[1:39] be with y'all next Sunday doing this mmm
[1:43] brother Dale's leaving Saturday we're
[1:44] going to Illinois for about five
[1:46] we'll be back maybe not for a little I
[1:50] think releases preaching next Sunday
[1:52] morning and errands Sunday afternoon and
[1:55] then somebody's going means that are you
[1:58] into from that yeah you got some Billy
[2:00] coming up Ernie okay alright last Sunday
[2:06] we were talking about Melchizedek you
[2:09] know picked up a problem with their boom
[2:11] so we're on that balcony
[2:13] now many people feel in st. now not in
[2:16] not in them in the message that we will
[2:18] clear run around was clear about this
[2:20] person who melt as me kiss them there
[2:23] are some denominations that think it's
[2:24] just a priesthood but remember we look
[2:31] at this and we see that it was a man so
[2:34] they had no beginning yeah knowing any I
[2:35] know father mother my heavens it
[2:37] couldn't be a human mortal and it have
[2:39] to be Almighty God now what happened was
[2:43] though is we we have to see we have to
[2:47] see cuz remember now remember this is
[2:52] this is this is where we have to think
[2:54] like Paul and Peter name there was no
[2:57] concept of a Trinity in their life
[3:02] there's no concept of a Trinity for Paul
[3:05] and Peter and all them so they're not
[3:07] even talking even when Paul says the God
[3:09] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[3:10] bless you all he know there's one
[3:12] daughter he's just giving you all the
[3:15] offices in all the positions
[3:16] same thing with Melchizedek could you
[3:20] see milk as neat now remember to I want
[3:24] to get into this maybe after I come back
[3:25] but Melchizedek make men Abraham flies
[3:28] he met Abram then he met Abraham read
[3:33] your Bible and Hebrew went and got a lot
[3:36] brought him back and then no cousin it
[3:38] came and giving communion under Abram
[3:42] which is made religious type of us in
[3:44] our journey then all right
[3:45] Abram it's our time before we get the
[3:48] Holy Ghost were able we're not in ham
[3:51] we're not problem son yet we're
[3:54] promise he's given us a promise that
[3:56] we're working towards so in Abraham's
[3:59] journey in justification and
[4:00] sanctification to Genesis 12 and all
[4:03] through there that is his journey
[4:04] through justification sanctification our
[4:06] journey through justification sanitation
[4:08] is Abram not Abraham our name doesn't
[4:13] change until we get the new birth
[4:14] all right then our main changes to
[4:17] Abraham are the Christian but you're not
[4:21] Christian before then for this
[4:27] Melchizedek king of Salem priest of the
[4:29] Most High God who made for him returning
[4:31] from the slaughter of the Kings and
[4:32] blessed him now I want you to see
[4:34] something to be proper and to be correct
[4:39] Paul should have said Abram cookie man
[4:43] Abram he didn't meet Abraham but now we
[4:46] look on this side of town dream okay
[4:50] because remember Paul never concludes
[4:56] that Abraham had any fault at all
[4:59] looking through the blood on this side
[5:01] in the New Testament in the Old
[5:03] Testament and the Old Testament look
[5:06] Abram first thing they from did was
[5:10] wrong
[5:12] first thing I ever did was wrong when he
[5:15] did
[5:15] God said Abram get up and follow me you
[5:20] and you alone what's the first thing you
[5:22] did eat to live always family don't get
[5:25] money which I feel cast top of us we get
[5:29] stable what everybody say we'll take a
[5:30] right but you know what sometimes that's
[5:33] not that's not my god say saliendo
[5:34] wander
[5:35] that's there for a little little time
[5:37] but remember he also gave his wife away
[5:40] as Abram and as Abraham okay mm-hmm
[5:45] he also when God told him he was gonna
[5:47] have the promised son instead of
[5:48] laughing in his heart he got down on the
[5:50] ground and laughed physically laughed in
[5:54] front of Godwin l remember brother Brown
[5:57] said if it wasn't for Abraham when Sarah
[6:00] laughed in her heart daughter would kill
[6:02] they killed Sarah for just giggling in
[6:04] their heart but Abraham gets on the
[6:06] ground just laughs it's not me okay so
[6:09] that's that's our journey that we have
[6:11] many faults and failures but once that
[6:13] promise son comes you watch Abraham he's
[6:15] right on point everything's right on
[6:16] point even when God tells him to take
[6:19] that promise son and take him upon a
[6:20] mountain in sacrificing he goes and
[6:22] don't hesitate he takes them right up
[6:24] there all right Abram I don't think
[6:27] would have done that
[6:28] they Braun was not in a position and
[6:30] that's what we want to talk about even
[6:32] in the seventh field we must be in a
[6:33] position to receive things from God okay
[6:37] being babies you can't receive a lot
[6:40] maybe just don't know what you're saying
[6:43] you look at me say don't do that don't
[6:44] do that
[6:46] well they just yeah that's right think
[6:48] back what just like babies hit the
[6:50] message to hurt the feeling they get the
[6:52] bit of dirt all right but as you grow
[6:54] older you know say well gonna do that
[6:55] when you know why you shouldn't do these
[6:57] things you know you shouldn't go walk
[6:59] out you know take a little baby those
[7:01] crawl out the mill that road with no
[7:02] fear wife though they don't know but as
[7:05] they get older they know what's going on
[7:07] that's thing with you or not that's
[7:09] being mature Christians that brother
[7:10] Brian tells us will not read it this
[7:13] weekend but as brother Graham tells us
[7:14] we have to come into speaking condition
[7:17] where they what we say is what God says
[7:19] and there's no in-between
[7:25] so remember that what the day that Jesus
[7:28] got up and said sure I did this for sure
[7:30] no he just lived his life he was God
[7:33] Almighty and human flesh he was led by
[7:34] the Spirit of God
[7:37] that's right right you didn't doubt he
[7:40] was God he didn't get up one morning to
[7:41] go I don't feel like well no he probably
[7:44] did good he probably got up some
[7:46] mornings and didn't feel like a human
[7:49] but he got up and went I don't know but
[7:53] now remember this person Melchizedek was
[7:55] a man and he was a king of Salem priest
[8:00] all these different things a physician
[8:04] in the Old Testament because remember
[8:09] brother rocks if we don't see
[8:11] Melchizedek any more we see Jesus Christ
[8:13] oh so in Paul is talking about
[8:16] Melchizedek but not Melchizedek being
[8:18] present at all Melchizedek Priesthood to
[8:22] us is done away with we don't we're not
[8:24] under Melchizedek Priesthood we're under
[8:26] the priesthood of Almighty God not not
[8:28] just a man here that puts on a skin a
[8:32] flashing tops to Abram and then steps
[8:35] out of it that flesh but that it thanks
[8:39] Craig that is cut so what part of that
[8:41] did I not was there not clear
[8:44] we're not going to we're not enter
[8:48] Melchizedek Priesthood yeah what I'm
[8:51] saying is is we will not there will not
[8:53] be a God in human flesh meet us on this
[8:59] earth to stay this way okay and if I got
[9:02] that we have a we have a priesthood that
[9:07] is a fivefold ministry priesthood that
[9:09] God uses our flesh to get to your flesh
[9:12] not flash but you know filter through
[9:14] memories and conscience and all that
[9:17] because remember we meet Melchizedek
[9:21] Jesus Christ God Almighty we meet him
[9:24] anyhow so so there's no redemption in
[9:27] the end all the redemption is down here
[9:29] everything to be redeemed for us now I'm
[9:31] talking about the bride not the whole
[9:33] world
[9:33] this member woman went to the sixth seal
[9:35] they got to be a purging of the 144,000
[9:38] the Buddhist virgin never can remember
[9:41] foods fruits burger and and the world so
[9:45] that has to go to a purging and that has
[9:47] to go through a developing of even a
[9:50] thousand years this thing's going to be
[9:52] going on but see you and I when we come
[9:53] to that here when Jesus walked out and
[9:58] said all the time I have never been
[9:59] given unto me it was done it was done he
[10:02] didn't there was nothing else to be
[10:04] fulfilled as far as part of his earthly
[10:06] journey of Jesus being on earth he was
[10:08] done twice Emily instead of Calgary into
[10:11] Spanish well then it was finished for
[10:13] that part but he went to the souls and
[10:16] president he went and picked up Abraham
[10:18] on them took him up into glory come back
[10:21] on and tell Pentecost and he's been
[10:23] working ever since but it as far as his
[10:25] earthly journey it was finishing
[10:26] partially human journey because when
[10:29] he'd come out of that tent to him he was
[10:30] not human he was inhuman he was immortal
[10:35] he wasn't just mortally with him or his
[10:38] flesh had been changed to be turnable
[10:40] will read that quote again today which I
[10:42] really love
[10:44] oh absolutely no I need it
[10:49] [Applause]
[10:52] [Music]
[10:53] that's correct well I mean many times
[10:56] you look and see Melchizedek has an
[11:01] older person and he was and he was a
[11:04] young man because when he stepped into
[11:07] that flesh he just molded around the
[11:10] theophany that he was and that was the
[11:12] same theophany you know even brother
[11:14] Brown why would he use the analogy when
[11:16] Jesus went to hell on the priest of the
[11:18] soul in prison he was NSD off that he
[11:20] wasn't in flesh is flesh still an
[11:22] antenna yeah when he opened the door to
[11:24] paradise we know it's a story but but I
[11:27] believe brother round saw it I believe
[11:29] it was true when Abraham said oh well
[11:31] said that's the guy we spend cavitation
[11:33] well it was Jesus standing there say man
[11:35] thank God all right so we see them to
[11:38] that they recognized him
[11:43] and that's what you and I during our
[11:45] journey we've got a meat milk isn't he
[11:47] just like hey I met Mel Kennedy but we
[11:50] don't meet melcat we don't mean Jesus
[11:52] Christ in human flesh we mean Jesus
[11:54] Christ in human flesh right here see
[12:00] that's the great mystery there's no
[12:02] mystery to a man walking up and saying
[12:04] how Melchizedek and I'm the eternal God
[12:06] there's no mystery to that but when we
[12:08] can say that we are that same person are
[12:12] part of that same person made manifest
[12:14] in another form called arrive it looked
[12:16] all different colors and flavors thing
[12:18] and all that nobody can see that they
[12:21] saw who do you think you are well I'm
[12:23] just telling you what the Bible thing I
[12:26] just really feel that's what the message
[12:28] of the hour was here to do was for
[12:30] brother Branham his sole message of
[12:34] course was to opening of the seals
[12:35] which revealed Christ and I'll read that
[12:38] this afternoon he was reveal Christ when
[12:40] I worst Christ revealed that in you and
[12:43] me he's not revealed in paper letters
[12:51] he's not even revealed in 1,100 servings
[12:54] brother Graham Creek if you can read him
[12:56] all the Daisy life and die and go to
[12:58] hell but when that comes off of the page
[13:00] and comes inside of you you forget to
[13:02] rest okay but reading them you have to
[13:07] read you have to read them we're not
[13:10] going away with about I'm just telling
[13:11] you these people read this message for
[13:13] 30 40 years from now they're out of the
[13:14] world they never got the essence of what
[13:16] was going on there that never became
[13:18] alive in their heart
[13:19] all right that's why you can take the
[13:22] quote and you can make it's a hundred
[13:24] thousand different things same this
[13:28] listened the same scriptures were
[13:29] reading today the Catholics reading them
[13:31] the Presbyterians reading them the
[13:33] Pentecostal to read them the Trinitarian
[13:35] to reading them and their sin all the
[13:37] Trinity's all the way through the Bible
[13:38] and we've got a Father Son and Holy
[13:40] Ghost medication it was just a
[13:42] priesthood Jim thing but we had the tree
[13:48] ice name like this the other day but
[13:50] that we get to listen on nice thing
[13:53] about this other day you know you take
[13:54] them you take a beautiful skyscraper and
[13:57] this thing's got like 150 floors two or
[14:01] 200 floors now what's the prettiest part
[14:03] of the skyscraper just a view from the
[14:06] top these things look pretty out here a
[14:09] man when you get up on top and you look
[14:11] out and you can see forever well how'd
[14:13] you get up there
[14:17] no no stairs that you might want to try
[14:22] it but go ahead no I want to get into a
[14:25] nice elevator and have it take me all
[14:27] the way up the top and there has to be
[14:30] in like in Atlanta when you go to the
[14:34] Marriott places or when I stayed over in
[14:35] the Philippines and then in a five-star
[14:37] hotel there's a guy standing there our
[14:39] girl and they say with for now when you
[14:43] get up there certain floor you can't go
[14:45] any further
[14:46] yes she has to put the key in or he has
[14:49] to put code in to get you in a been out
[14:51] so you can't really see what's going on
[14:54] that's what I'm saying about this
[14:55] the Word of God has always been there's
[14:57] always been the building this message is
[14:59] what takes us up through the statute
[15:02] perfect man in that elevator but there
[15:04] was a man standing there running around
[15:06] him there was a man a prophet stand-in
[15:08] there they when we got to the certain
[15:10] level we couldn't go no further
[15:12] he said I got the key clicker I've got
[15:14] the code and the code took us all the
[15:16] way up to the top so what you see what's
[15:18] going on see the landscape of God the
[15:20] landscape of God's what I want to see
[15:24] it's a little analogy they're tweeting
[15:26] you know you can try to walk up 250
[15:32] floors and if you calculate that tell me
[15:36] how many steps that isn't it's
[15:37] astronomical but you and I don't have
[15:40] that time they may have done it Luther
[15:41] Wesley's day so they were way down here
[15:43] but you get what we're going winning an
[15:44] elevator we need some fingers to the top
[15:46] and that's what this message is it's
[15:48] taking us to the top sphere to right up
[15:50] to here to the stack your perfect man
[15:53] but you got to look at 18 times turning
[15:57] do them all so a man get a tenth part of
[15:59] all of them
[16:00] my affair first being my interpretation
[16:03] king of righteousness and after that
[16:05] king will fail them which is the king of
[16:07] peace but we obviously know that is and
[16:10] then without father without mother
[16:12] without this sent no words he had no
[16:16] descendants right his descendants are
[16:19] sitting here now because your
[16:21] descendants don't come before you think
[16:23] descend actively okay so that's what
[16:28] happened on the day of Pentecost he we
[16:29] became his descendants on the day of
[16:31] Pentecost his sons and daughters he had
[16:34] no sons and daughters while he was on
[16:35] earth zero right without father without
[16:41] mother without descent having neither
[16:43] beginning of days nor end of life but
[16:45] made like them to the Son of God the
[16:47] bodies of priests continuing now
[16:51] consider how great this man was when did
[16:54] he leave of the patron help gave
[16:56] spoiled and barely paying that are the
[16:59] sons of Levi who received the office of
[17:01] the priesthood have a commandment to
[17:03] take tithes of the people according to
[17:05] the law that is of their brethren though
[17:07] they come out of the loins of Abraham
[17:10] they may understand that Levi the
[17:13] Levitical priesthood remember it was
[17:15] Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph come out from
[17:19] Jacob with what the tribes or the
[17:23] children of Israel Levi Reuben it's a
[17:27] car and Natali and all the ones ever I
[17:29] got that but God chose a little bit the
[17:32] Levi why did you believe I've you know
[17:34] why I'm in the Old Testament there was
[17:36] some commotion going on and leave up
[17:38] Levitical or Levi's single-most just
[17:42] turned to him and said hey you know what
[17:44] you can do about it so we'll just go
[17:45] kill them the latest we kill them all
[17:47] that's what's happened today we come up
[17:49] to church today we're going to come to a
[17:50] killing that's right we're gonna get all
[17:52] these things killed that looks right
[17:54] well God can only fill those who are not
[17:58] full of left okay so that was that
[18:03] started a Levitical priesthood but now
[18:06] remember the the true Levitical
[18:07] priesthood had to am because it was a
[18:09] person it was people descending
[18:12] generations Jesus had no descending
[18:14] generation right that's why I like that
[18:17] scripture who shall declare his
[18:18] generation there's a there's a group of
[18:21] people they see declaring the generation
[18:22] of God that's us right and they will
[18:26] command you to take tithes of the people
[18:28] according to law that is of their
[18:29] brethren though they come out on the one
[18:31] to bait them him they he like I say some
[18:34] about everybody understand about we're
[18:36] talking about Thailand just for a second
[18:38] because what happened I was reading this
[18:40] the other day there's up there certain
[18:42] other times that was given but the
[18:44] Levites the Levites gave time that's
[18:48] what a lot of Ministers don't think they
[18:50] should pay
[18:51] ties with life just a bunch of baloney
[18:52] do you think everybody plays tired they
[18:55] weren't they weren't set aside you know
[18:56] they were set aside in the whole of
[18:58] Israel they would be 10 she'd go through
[19:01] and 9 would make it in one way well out
[19:06] of a pretend there was one went into the
[19:08] pen for the Levi and that sustained them
[19:12] or paid their living but then the Levi's
[19:16] pay a 10% time back into the back end to
[19:20] run everything all right so that's the
[19:22] same way with you and I and brother Dale
[19:23] brother Dale gets the salary from the
[19:25] church he turned around
[19:26] Rostow chick puts it back in the church
[19:27] you know what it does it pays the
[19:29] salaries of people that come in and
[19:31] preach that's how he pays his ties to
[19:36] you he's done that forever and that
[19:37] should be the way he do it I don't think
[19:41] you should know no one is exempt from
[19:43] Fayette I know one zero I don't care who
[19:47] you are brother Branham paid time at
[19:50] $1,100 to goddamn teeth $10 won in them
[19:53] when they often play all right so sons
[20:00] of Levi we know that's over with the he
[20:03] whose descent is not counted from them
[20:06] received tithes of Abraham and blessed
[20:09] him that had the promises all right give
[20:13] me and without all contradiction the
[20:17] less is blessed of the better so 10% is
[20:21] blessed listen God can take 10% live off
[20:24] of 10% and we can't live off a name we
[20:28] have a struggle living off of 90 if you
[20:30] if you if you don't watch what you doing
[20:31] right and here men that die receive
[20:34] tithes but there he was Siva them with
[20:36] whom that his witness that he liveth as
[20:40] I may say so Levi also to receiving time
[20:46] paid Todd you can think I got that out
[20:48] of just the air Deacon Levi's paid time
[20:55] because where was it is said that in
[20:57] Levi's paid tithes while he was still in
[20:59] the
[21:00] background well that was his
[21:01] great-great-grandfather yeah okay frame
[21:05] was yet in the loins of his father moon
[21:07] milk as a big medic or the father all
[21:10] right so look if they're for perfection
[21:15] were by the Levitical priesthood there
[21:19] was no perfect perfection on a little
[21:20] bit of the priesthood all the Devils
[21:22] made sacrifices that covered the sin of
[21:24] Israel and kept pushing it like the
[21:26] Prophet said pushing into Calvary
[21:28] pushing it away all right for an under
[21:31] it that people receive the law what
[21:34] further need was there that another
[21:36] priest should rise after the order of
[21:38] Melchizedek and not be caught after the
[21:41] order of Aaron all right look for the
[21:43] priesthood it being changed nobody's
[21:47] done that so much about hesitates how am
[21:49] i coming from another priesthood all
[21:50] right for the priesthood being changed
[21:53] there is made of necessity a change also
[21:56] of the law now look that doesn't mean
[21:59] they rewrote the law that law is written
[22:02] for every the law of the law King James
[22:05] Ten Commandments they've not become
[22:07] intensive guests they're okay for he of
[22:15] whom these things were spoken for ten to
[22:17] another tribe of which no man gave
[22:19] attendance at the offer
[22:20] now watch cuz look Jesus never came from
[22:25] that probably by you would think being
[22:27] in the priesthood line of Levi that
[22:31] Jesus would be the great high priests he
[22:33] is there's no mother then he would come
[22:36] from Levi but he's not he came from the
[22:39] tribe of Judah right because she was the
[22:42] lawgiver what forgiving these things are
[22:48] spoken to panic to another tribe they
[22:50] strung from my Jesus name come out the
[22:52] Lord coming out of Judah
[22:54] of which no man gave attendance at the
[22:56] altar in other words Judah wasn't
[22:59] allowed in the temple but for it is
[23:02] evident that our Lord sprang out of
[23:04] Judah of which tribe Moses spake nothing
[23:07] concerning freeze
[23:08] he hit that thing so well God did and it
[23:14] is yet far more evident from that after
[23:16] the civil to or the whiteness I think
[23:19] this one that says work likeness
[23:24] Oh milk as Isaiah Rises another priests
[23:28] priests priests priests who has made not
[23:33] after the law of the carnal commandment
[23:36] war
[23:37] what is carnal that's man fleshly
[23:40] commandment excuse me because most of
[23:45] all your Ten Commandments are fleshly
[23:46] don't kill don't back off with what we
[23:50] love your mother and father you know I'm
[23:53] the LORD thy God I want now that one
[23:55] maybe but most of it comes from fleshly
[23:58] things because remember back the Old
[24:00] Testament that's all they had that's all
[24:02] they had was the priests could walk up
[24:05] and they can have a thought about a
[24:07] woman not commit adultery with not touch
[24:10] her and they will find gone the
[24:12] politician don't play with the person
[24:14] but when Jesus comes and he said now if
[24:18] you just think about it that's why I
[24:21] said that this this flesh doesn't sin
[24:23] this is not the same part it was born in
[24:26] sin but this not the same part if some
[24:28] of the Jesus would say well that's right
[24:29] you just don't touch that girl and
[24:31] you're fine no he said you think in your
[24:34] heart you've already done it whether so
[24:36] it's got to go down into the memory
[24:38] reason conscience affection imagination
[24:39] of the person nothing not reflection we
[24:43] may not have long carnal commandment but
[24:45] after the power the endless life
[24:47] remember because remember he knows there
[24:48] was no strength in the law it was the
[24:51] schoolmaster to bring us to Christ but
[24:53] there was no strength in the law is why
[24:54] it did hurt you it didn't make sense in
[24:56] nerves regarding just made you the
[24:57] neighbor a good person right but God
[25:00] allowed that until Christ came for he
[25:04] testified thou art a priest forever
[25:06] after the order of Melchizedek for
[25:09] there's barely a decent knowing of the
[25:13] commandment that we're distant humming
[25:15] that would be setting aside going before
[25:21] for the weakness and unprofitable nests
[25:23] there up right after the lost weak and
[25:26] unprofitable right the converse nineteen
[25:32] for the law made nothing perfect but the
[25:35] bringing in of a better hope did well is
[25:39] it Jesus Christ by the which we drove
[25:44] nine to God in other words with the law
[25:47] there was no way to get the gun
[25:49] there was one priest you put everything
[25:51] on him he went in he had to be perfect
[25:55] in his outfit and all of his ways he may
[25:58] have sacrificed the people outside and
[26:00] there were new anything what went on
[26:01] inside there but now you and I watch and
[26:06] in as much as not without an oath he was
[26:09] made priests now he'd interplay for
[26:12] those priests were made without a know
[26:14] but this with enough by him that said
[26:17] unto Him the Lord swear and will not
[26:19] repent thou art a priest for ever after
[26:22] after the order of melchizedek by so
[26:26] much was Jesus made a surety of a better
[26:29] what Testament I like that word surety
[26:34] guarantee Ave what better covenant
[26:44] because remember ever happen that one
[26:47] priest was when he went and again give
[26:49] the that Tolman these people I had were
[26:56] just doing whatever I want to do right I
[26:59] mean they were just God wasn't looking
[27:01] at them he was going to sacrifice but
[27:03] now Christ came in he now wants to get
[27:06] into people that's what he always wanted
[27:08] to do he's always wanted to live in
[27:09] people not with people don't believe in
[27:12] them
[27:12] then when gleaming you know he can live
[27:14] with them right so a better testament
[27:17] would be that he would come to earth
[27:19] because that's what the whole summation
[27:21] is going to be and they truly were many
[27:23] priests because they were not suffered
[27:25] to continue by reason of death but this
[27:28] man because he continued ever had an
[27:31] unchangeable priesthood right wherefore
[27:34] he is able also to save them law can
[27:38] save anybody to the uttermost that came
[27:41] unto God by him seeing he ever liveth to
[27:44] make intercession for them what Jesus
[27:47] Christ our high priest for such an high
[27:49] priest became us hmm or was fitting for
[27:57] us who is holy harmless undefiled
[28:00] separate from sinners and made higher
[28:03] than the heavens who needed not daily as
[28:06] those high priests to offer up sacrifice
[28:09] first for his own sins of remember but
[28:12] not a priest one in he may sacrifice
[28:13] would you say then he made a sacrifice
[28:16] to the people cuz he had to do here to
[28:18] get his self by the way first and then
[28:20] for the people right and that's what
[28:22] Christ did he came down here took on
[28:24] flesh to die for me and he'll need to be
[28:26] up high free who needed not daily as
[28:30] these high priests to offer up sacrifice
[28:33] first for his own sins and then for the
[28:35] people for this he did once when he went
[28:37] to Calvary in other words when he
[28:38] offered up himself because remember the
[28:41] high priest didn't offer up himself the
[28:43] offer the high priest from taking blood
[28:45] of something
[28:46] right so there was no consequence
[28:49] except one thing that people stress
[28:53] right if he walked right get all the
[28:55] pomegranates and not if he did
[28:56] everything right I couldn't kill him
[28:58] there's already something cute
[28:59] there was a lamb had been killed but
[29:01] this guy offered up himself
[29:03] right where the law maketh man high
[29:06] priests which have infirmity but the
[29:09] word of the oath which was sense though
[29:11] all maketh the son who is consecrated
[29:14] forevermore in other words he will
[29:16] evermore be he'll always be a high
[29:20] priest look now the things which we have
[29:23] spoken this is the son I love Paul all
[29:26] that that we had right there he gets to
[29:30] a main point verse that chapter 7
[29:34] now these things we have spoken this is
[29:38] the son we have such a high priest who
[29:41] is set on the right hand of the throne
[29:43] of the Majesty in heaven no where's the
[29:45] mediator right see Melchizedek when he
[29:52] met Abraham was not a mediator he was a
[29:55] messenger he wasn't the mediator he was
[29:59] the messenger he didn't come and say
[30:02] Abraham now I'm gonna go die and then he
[30:05] know he just give him a message Abraham
[30:07] about time alive you'll change your body
[30:10] doesn't work that's what he was saying
[30:11] and Sarah gonna change go back you'll
[30:13] have a baby
[30:14] alright Nene laughs but now this person
[30:17] no he's right there anything he gave his
[30:20] life for us a minister of the sanctuary
[30:22] of the true tabernacle which the Lord
[30:25] pitched in that land
[30:26] who'd he talked about himself his body
[30:28] where every high priest his ordained
[30:31] offering gifts and sacrifices where for
[30:34] his of a necessity that this man have
[30:36] someone also the huffin what do you
[30:38] offer don't pretty self right for him he
[30:41] were on earth he should not be a priest
[30:44] seemed that there a priest that offer
[30:46] you according to the law who stirred
[30:49] through the example and shadow of
[30:51] heavenly things whatever happened down
[30:55] here is what Moses went
[30:57] I remember when brother Brown said Moses
[31:00] went to heaven and got the vision of the
[31:03] tabernacle and all that it was really
[31:04] Jesus Christ but when he came to earth
[31:06] he built the best he could do was run
[31:09] out of court enter court holy of Holy's
[31:10] he builted everything down he recording
[31:12] so that was a shadow of what was in
[31:15] heaven because remember all that
[31:18] sweetness you know that that temple
[31:19] there there will never be a temple that
[31:21] God goes to many more ship you and made
[31:24] that temple have been done away with the
[31:26] physical temple even when they get it
[31:29] finished in Israel this time do any good
[31:32] got time left it needs the left the
[31:34] temple as Moses was admonished of God
[31:38] when he was about to make the tabernacle
[31:41] for seed stands he that now make all
[31:44] things according to the pattern showed
[31:45] to thee in the mouth in other words when
[31:47] he went to the mountain he got the
[31:49] pattern to make them out of court in
[31:52] court holy holy spark and all those
[31:54] things but now has he obtained a more
[31:57] excellent ministry by how much also he
[32:00] is the mediator of a better covenant
[32:02] which was established upon better
[32:04] promises because remember the promises
[32:08] was made in the Old Testament were
[32:11] promises of if you make this sacrifice
[32:15] I'll forgive you and next year you're
[32:19] gonna have to do the same thing and if
[32:21] you have another problem you're gonna
[32:22] have to make another sacrifice and
[32:24] you're gonna have to do this I was
[32:27] reading yesterday morning where Solomon
[32:30] when he finished the temple if I'm not
[32:33] mistaken there was like a hundred
[32:35] thousand sacrifices beyond number the
[32:39] Bible said that was made for all these
[32:42] different things that they had to make
[32:44] it for hundred thousand animals that was
[32:47] a mess but now see all I start away with
[32:52] there was one man John on the cross and
[32:55] and now they we're at that first
[32:57] covenant had been faultless they should
[32:59] no place in this offer the second other
[33:01] words if everything in the Old Testament
[33:02] was fine
[33:03] why don't we need Jesus to come down and
[33:05] dive in human body well he wasn't
[33:07] perfect it was they had Paul for finding
[33:11] fault with them he said behold the days
[33:13] come saith the Lord when I will make a
[33:14] new covenant with the house of his room
[33:16] with the house of Judah not according to
[33:19] the Covenant that I made with their
[33:20] fathers in the day when I took them by
[33:22] the hand to lead them out of the land of
[33:24] egypt because they continued not in my
[33:26] covenant and i regarded them not for
[33:30] touch for this is the covenant that i
[33:32] will make with the house of israel after
[33:34] those days saith the Lord I will put my
[33:37] laws into their line and write them in
[33:40] their heart not on the tablet and I will
[33:43] be to them a god and they shall be to me
[33:45] a people and they shall not teach every
[33:48] man his neighbor and every man his
[33:49] brother saying know the Lord for all
[33:51] show know me from the least to the
[33:53] greatest now once he said I'm not just
[33:55] going to come down and get in and talk
[33:57] in one man to a group and they just
[34:00] believe that man no I'm going to go in
[34:02] each individual person right for all
[34:05] shall know me from the least of the
[34:07] grades probably merciful to their
[34:09] unrighteousness and their sins and their
[34:11] iniquities will I remember no more and
[34:14] that he say of a new covenant he has
[34:17] made the first old that's why they call
[34:19] it the Old Testament and they call it
[34:21] the New Testament now that which
[34:25] decayeth and waxeth old is ready to
[34:28] vanish away
[34:29] in other words hey you can't you can't
[34:32] find Solomon I was reading there in
[34:35] where wasn't King Solomon built his
[34:36] temple took him years to build this
[34:39] place beautiful gold everywhere ivory
[34:43] and all these things
[34:44] find it now there's one little porch
[34:47] sitting over there now they call it
[34:48] follow its porch and
[34:49] bunch of rotten steps that go up to
[34:52] nothing there's nothing there a new
[35:00] covenant he has made the first covenant
[35:02] old now that which decays the Wackness
[35:05] old is ready
[35:07] consensually continue reading then
[35:11] barely the first covenant had also
[35:13] offices of divine service and a worldly
[35:15] sanctuary a worldly sanctuary well there
[35:19] was a tabernacle made the first were in
[35:21] was the candlestick in the table and the
[35:23] shewbread which is called the sanctuary
[35:24] now will register I mean we're going to
[35:27] stop the book there and after the second
[35:30] Bale the tabernacle which is called the
[35:32] holiest of all remember there's only
[35:34] there's only two males there was no veil
[35:40] in the outer court the outer court it
[35:42] was just a court you walked into a court
[35:44] the first veil was the inner court right
[35:50] now the court had no veil in a court and
[35:52] a veil with the candlesticks and only
[35:55] certain people what I'm saying is
[35:56] certain only certain people get to the
[35:57] segment only one could go to the to the
[36:00] next one which was the state of bail
[36:02] right the tabernacle which is called the
[36:06] holiest of all in other words we've had
[36:08] the sensors and all these we read that
[36:10] two Sundays from now look at the bottom
[36:13] they got double duty this weekend
[36:15] refresh this weekend's are all of our
[36:17] criminally really good we're going to do
[36:20] a service more
[36:21] Kentucky not brother bar will go to a
[36:24] different Church for him oh no he never
[36:31] called me back Jojo hear that no one has
[36:33] called me back from the whole turn
