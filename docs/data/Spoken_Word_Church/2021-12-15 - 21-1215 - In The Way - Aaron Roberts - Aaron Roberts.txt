========================================

i don't know who loves going back to make things right with people but i know for me it's hard sometimes [Laughter] so um anyway i had a situation with my um my son have two friends to go to school with and uh he hangs out with them often because they play sports together so um i didn't get a chance to meet the mother yet so one day um isaac calls me um a little bit later than he should have been and asked me if he could spend the night so my thing is like i've been trying to school him isaac do not call me at the last minute let me meet the parents first let me you know get things in order and this is something i try to drill in his head since he was little but obviously that didn't work that day he just felt like i'm gonna call mom at the last minute to see if i can stay the night okay so he caught me off guard and um and i was like isaac i told you don't call me at the last minute and exit me something like that when you already know what i'm going to say i don't know these people so i didn't know that this lady heard me saying that you know i didn't know she could hear me having that conversation with him so uh you know as it gets home or whatever i get a phone call i think maybe the next day and uh didn't go too well you know i i she had some things to say and um and i felt uncomfortable and i didn't say all the right things either i was trying to stay calm but you know when you get all your adrenaline going and you kind of like you know so um anyway long story short i felt bad i started feeling bad later and it started bothering me um but i kind of gave all kind of reasoning and justified well she called me she started it and you know god i i you know i gave all the reasons why i shouldn't have to go back but yet the little voice like no go back and make it right i'm like ah every time i pass her house you get a little funny feeling of you know i think i even seen her in the grocery store because we stayed in a small town and i'm trying to dodge and go to the next aisle and everything you know so it started getting a little bit out of hand so so i'm wrestling with god like oh my god i don't want to i don't want to be the one going back you know so um it came to a point where god you know no matter how i try to flush it out you that little voice still there still there won't go away and i'm feeling tormented and everything and satan tried to add more to that as time goes on you know with other people or other things he's like man i got four things to go back and make right man so um anyway i mean it started it started to really like cause panics attacks and everything stress all kind of stuff start happening over these few little things i was like i gotta get this right i mean and satan try to make it huger than what it is right just make it huger than what it really is i'm reasoning what's she gonna think what's she gonna say what if she don't accept my apology what is this what is that you know all kind of stuff so um i reached out and got prayer from um some of the sisters that i keep in touch with i'm like look pray for me i got to make things right so i can be able to continue my journey you know so um anyway i got prayed for and everything and um this is probably like maybe a month or month and a half later so finally i realized i got to go back and make it right because they might can get away with whatever they do or say but god holds us accountable more we're not we can't do like everybody else it just he deals with you as his child so i'm like okay all right i'm looking up all kinds of scriptures to encourage me and everything and um so finally i prayed up prayed i prayed up um still feeling that wrestling moment in my head like oh you know so finally i sit on my couch one day and i felt a small little subtle feeling come over me so peaceful so calm and it was like make that phone call right now to her and it was like i felt the other all the other emotions was kind of like at a standstill i don't know how i don't know how i'm feeling it but i'm feeling it it was like everything else was like at a standstill as if it had to stop and this small set of voice was the one that was in forefront of all these other emotions and i knew my spirit oh my god now's the time to call her so i called her she didn't pick up so i left a message and um i explained to her how i apologize and you know i said i would love to talk to you and everything and just clear make some things clear to you so you can understand clearly on um you know i know what you heard probably sound very bad and i it wasn't an attack on your family at all but i would love to talk to you just to clarify everything so um i get a text back from her later and she said oh thank you so much you know i would love to talk to you i'll call you you know at the end of the week whatever so anyway long story short um she calls me we talk it went so peaceful i learned so much about her and she was so sorry how she handled it because she was going through a lot and everything and she explained everything she went through even as a child and i was like wow you know and um i mean just to get everything out and get everything right i felt so good and you almost you know just you feel that extension of hope and peace and joy and all the fruits of the spirits that you should be feeling you know and even extending it to somebody else and giving her hope and everything and you know just it was so it felt so good and it just kind of broke down the barriers to do that to um everybody else that i was dealing with too that i had to go back and make a few things right so i just want to encourage everybody if something going on it might even be like the right thing to do but it might be the right time god will give you to do it so you can actually do the right thing but at the wrong time because you don't know what's going on on their side so god can give you that little piece to let you know when it's time and when it's when it's good to do it you know that's it hey man i just want to encourage men and women men and women over 50 get this shingle shot no one wants to experience what i just went through and even if you've had them before you can get them again get the shot i'm not an advocate for vaccines and stuff but as soon as this is cleared up with me susan's getting the shot because i don't ever want to experience this again and really for it was hard for me but for really elderly people it could be detrimental it really could so i encourage everybody if you're they won't give you the shot to your 50 if you're 50 and above man or woman get the shot i mean it's good amen uh remember saturday there'll be practice at ten o'clock for the church play for sunday so make sure

we'll uh look into the scripture this evening certainly there's a lot to need to remember thanks thanks for praying for my mom and continue to hold her up in prayer and just like so many people i've been amazed at how how many people is just constantly people have been put in the hospital not just mom but other people and it's just so many i mean so there's it's just comes in it comes in waves it seems like everybody seems to get well and then everybody gets sick and changing of the weather and a lot of different things and certainly uh just want to continue to hold each one and those that are not here with us and just so many that you think about them during the day and you just you know i always like what uh general jackson you know brother brown always tells that story i always like it pray without ceasing and that man asked general jackson he said well how can you pray without ceasing he said i can't do anything without praying he said i didn't he said i don't open a letter unless i pray about before or read it he said i don't drop a letter in the mailbox until i pray for the person he said i don't take a drink of water without he said it it's just as natural to pray for that water it is as to open my mouth to receive it it's so and then he was talking about he said i prayed for my students when he was he was an instructor at virginia military institute and he said i stood at the door and he said lord prepare me because when i walk in the classroom to prepare these young men and he said lord help them and so everything that we ought to you know everything that we approach god with approach it in prayer i think about that lord i want to be that way to have that prayerful attitude first thing you when you wake up in the morning everything that you do is a prayer to god communing with god so god bless you this evening we're going to get right into the word i want to keep you too long first samuel chapter nine as you can see here on the screen and uh we'll talk about the way get being in the way and and not being in the way that's what brother adam said so that's why we want to talk about being in the way and uh god has a plan for us he has a way we need to be in that way amen so let's just all bow our heads and we'll speak to the author tonight our gracious heavenly father lord jesus we're just so thankful for another time to be in your house lord together with those of like precious faith father lord together around your word lord you said it where two or three are gathered in in your name you'll be there in the midst and lord we just pray tonight that you just come and have your way with us tonight speak to each heart and each life lord father for those that are watching through the internet lord that will be watching later i just pray that lord they receive a blessing lord just touch them whatever they have need a father for the sick and the afflicted lord there's just so many that that have a need for you you know each one in my mind or the ones we've prayed about today and lord the ones that have a have a need whatever the needs are lord i pray for those that are in kentucky lord in the path of those tornadoes lord just every time i see those pictures lord lord you just be with them amen lord be with mom in the hospital lord lord just continue to bless her lord we've seen you move before we know that you're the great physician lord you've done it once i know that you'll do it again father we just pray that everything is said and done will be for your honor and glory tonight bless us anoint us lead us by thou understanding lord by thy grace lord that's what we need in this hour we ask all these things in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen first samuel chapter 9 verse 1 says now there was a man of benjamin who whose name was kish the son of abial the son of zeor the son of becoreth the son of apha a benjamin knight a mighty man of power and he had a son whose name was saul a choice young man and a goodly and there was not among the children of israel a goodlier person than he from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people just just imagine that that's what you think about where saul started and the asses of kish saul's father were lost and kish said to saul his son now take one of the servants with thee and arise go seek the asses and he passed through the mountain ephraim and passed through the land of shalitia but they found them not and they passed through the land of shalom and there they were not and he passed through the land of the benjaminites and they found them not and when they were come to the land of zeus saul said to his servant that was with him come and let us return lest my father leave caring for the asses and take thought for us and he said unto him behold now there is in this city a man of god and he is an honorable man all that he saith cometh surely to pass and now let us go thither pre-adventure he can show us our way that we should go then said saul to his servant behold if we go what shall we bring them in for the man for the bread is spent in our vessels and there is not a present to bring to the man of god what have we and the servant answered so again and said behold i have here a man the fourth part of a shackle of silver that will i give to the man of god to tell us our way amen god bless you tonight you may be seated and just want to look here in the scripture on the looking at part of saul's life and you know it's a it's amazing when you think about saul and what the scripture said about him was a was a a great young man he had a had a good upbringing and and you know he went out to do the work of his father and and we know that as the scripture tells us here you know they went looking for the for the animals the donkeys and you know and many times in our lives we look at things that come our way and just just as as saul no doubt thought this was hey this is just doing the father's work and you know just the day-to-day type thing that we're going through but you know when he come to that place he come into that area after they've done all of the journeying through and trying to find the donkeys they come to that place but you know it's a servant just happened to mention it's like you know there's a man of god in this area right here we've reached this place and you know we ought to go see him because the things that he says of god surely come to pass he said you know and we've looked for these animals and no doubt he can tell us where these animals are and we don't we don't have to keep looking for them but you know saul knowing and as a scripture tells us saul was like well we don't have anything to bring to him because that when the when they would go to see the seers or the prophets you know they had respect unto them to bring them something and it showed it showed respect under the office of the prophet and so when you know when they come and had just that little bit to bring to him he's like well we'll go and see but you know we read later on in in the chapter if you read the chapter and you know we know that as saul and the servant they bego to try to find samuel god has already spoken to samuel and told him that there's a benjamite coming that i've called and so he's looking at this as just as a happenstance kind of situation but he don't realize that he is in the way that god has called him in and so you know he's like well we are in this way because this is this is my what my father's asked me to do and then the the servant says we need to go see the prophet and so here's in the way well let's go find the prophet and he just thinks we're just doing this because we're trying to find my father's animals we're just doing what the father said and saul don't realize that god has called him because because the scripture tells us beforehand that samuel is told of the lord that that saul is coming and he said i'm going to make him king that i'm going to make him a leader in israel and it and that we know that samuel had already set aside a portion of meat for samuel and saul to eat he'd already prepared prepared all these things that planned these things to take place and what was going to take place and here's saul going into this situation and and he's just there and you know kind of taken aback by the things that when saw when because they go and they look for him and they don't even know who samuel is and when they come out there and they start looking for him and the first thing that samuel tells him he says i'm the seer saul and then no doubt catches you know saul off guard because you know i'm looking for this man i don't know who he is but i know he's a seer and they you know he asked about him and everything but when he walks into the presence of samuel then samuel begins to explain to him what his job is what god has has called him to you found favor in the eyes of god because you are to be anointed to be a leader god has called you to something and the first thing that we see that saul says it talks about you know i i come from a small tribe you know how am i going to be called up to do anything because he sees that he sees himself because when samuel begins to prophesy to him saul saul begins to see hey i'm inadequate at doing this he has he because he has humility at the fact that god is calling him and realizing i can't do this why would god call me and he sees that he sees he steps in to a realm of humility understanding the vastness of the job that's been laid before him but samuel was telling me listen god has called you and not only has he called you to this but i'm but i'm gonna but you know he sat him before the people and he fed him but he said listen you're going to be on this journey and you're going to see these landmarks along the way that you know that you're heading in the right direction you know when he when he leaves from samuel as as he begins to travel you know he goes on this journey you know as he begins to leave he tells him he said listen you know you're going to meet men that have bread and they have kids and he said they're going to give you portions and then you're going to continue on and he said then when you get into the land of the uh the i believe the philistines you know when you go on he said then you get into this place he said then you're going to run into the school of the prophets and he said you know he said when you reach this place he said the anointing is going to fall upon you and you're going to begin to prophesy and the scripture tells us that when he began to do these things he said then all of a sudden exactly what samuel had told him happened and then and not only had had saul god had spoken to saul but then all of a sudden the people began to see because when he began to prophesy he's like saul's with the prophets why because he began to so people began to see that the anointing had landed on saul god had called him and people began to see so you know it's the same way with you and i you know we you don't have to work yourself into something you don't why because if you're anointed of god and god has called you then he's going to anoint you for the job and you know what you don't have to you don't have to fight you don't have to struggle why because if you're in the way as jesus said i am the way the truth and the life so if we're in christ then you know we don't fight we don't have to fuss we don't why because god makes a way but you know it's just like it's just like saul he was standing there and don't well how am i supposed to do these things what samuel wanted him to understand to be encouraged listen you're not doing this because god has anointed you to do it and if he's anointed you to do it then it's not you're going to have to do it by yourself it's not it's not you doing this it's god leading you and so you know that that's the way it is to start out is to know how god's gonna lead you i don't i don't try to lean in my own intellect or my own understanding the scripture tells us you know not not to lean on our own understanding you know because if if god has called us and he's and he's gifted us well then you know what god is the one that operates the gift as brother roman said when when it come to preaching you know god placed a gift in a man he said but you operate the gift amen so when we come up here it's it's not us having to do anything right right but it's but it's it's a it's a harmony it it it is it is a a synchronous operation amen because you know what they you know it would it's it's really hard to preach to the walls if you if you're if you ever tried to do it you know because you know it because that's not the way it was designed and and so when you when you get into a situation you know and it's and you know we just don't come to church you know so somebody we're just going to sit here and we're going to listen to the preacher right well you know what then then you're not in you're not in the in the right atmosphere in the right way then then the preacher you know i i was listening to uh i went back and listened to when uh brother daryl ward was here you know and he got up here and he said he said who's gonna help me preach this morning all right and he said what the rest of you going to do because you know he only got a few hands raised he was like well you know because you know it works that way you know you know everybody everybody likes free even if you just smile at the preacher it's nice if you even if you naught off for a while if you wake up just smile it's a benefit as brother donny reagan always said not a little louder but i mean at least at least you know you don't look like you know people are mad at you i mean you know it's it's really hard when you know and and it's in it and i know it bothers other people but let me tell you it does not bother me whatsoever if you go to sleep if you nod off it don't bother me because you know what i'm just going to continue to preach to the people that are watching amen and if you nod off and you only get part of it that's okay we'll be here when you wake up because you know what i've i i honestly i've been there you know i have i've come to church on wednesday nights and and it's it's everything you can do you put everything into it just to stay awake we're human beings i understand that and you know but it's it's okay i understand but you know i mean it but it's it's a it's a working together you know i've never seen a if you've never had to stand behind a pulpit even if you just have to get up here and read the announcements or read prayer requests it's nice to have somebody smile at you or nod or something you know because you know when you when you get up here i mean it's even when you do public speaking if you're not just preaching but i mean if just in public having to get up before people you know it's nice to have somebody if you feel like they're on your side and so that was free yes but you know it's it's all of us working together we all have to be in the same in the same because you know as we get here it's not just that you know we're just here to warm up you but it's us to be in the same atmosphere to create the atmosphere to be in the same be in the spirit because you know as as you know you you go to a ball game or or a movie or anything like that everybody gets engrossed in it you know i've never seen anybody walk in to a ball game and you know they go into this ball game and it's like well i'm just here you know because somebody comes if because they've went someplace and they've done something most of the time when you go to a ballgame you've had to pay money it's cost you something well because you've had to put something in well you know what i expect something in return but you didn't come there was like well you know what i don't like either one of these teams and i'm just here i've never seen anybody do that have you know if i'm gonna if i'm gonna watch a ball game i want somebody on you know and and adam adam you know he he's a big football fan and adam he has he has this thing it's like you can't you can't watch football unless you have somebody do you who you pulling for well i just like i'm just enjoying the game i'm just enjoying the game i don't have to have a dog in the fight as they say i'm just enjoying it but you know it's like no you got to have somebody to root for but you know you don't see people going there's like you know i i'm just here i wish i was at home i wish i was somewhere else but i paid good money to be here had said no one ever i've never met anybody have you so if we come to church then we should have an expectation if we come to church then you know because you know when i when i come to here tonight i didn't i didn't come just to see all of you oh that's that's nice but you know what it would be an utter failure if christ didn't come if god didn't come and speak to us tonight here then you know what we gathered in vain then it's worth it it's worthless to be here we wasted our time [Applause] but you know we come with an expectation to be here we set aside this time to be here tonight so when we come in the door then when we made an expectation to because he said that wherever two or three are gathered in my name he said i'm there in the midst so if he's here tonight then what did he come here to do you know god didn't come here tonight just to run a tangle up and down your spine [Music] because you know what if he doesn't speak to you from the word then what's the gathering about because you know we can stand in the presence of god but you know what if he doesn't speak to us from the word then we've missed it well because we stand in the presence of god to commune with him it's to speak to him and have him speak to us then it's lord what are you trying to say to me what have you said to me lord i just want i just want to sit here tonight and open up and lay aside everything else i want to push the world outside that i can talk to you that you can talk to me that when i leave here tonight then i've heard something that's changed my life and i just said say well we've had it we've had a good uh social gathering we've had our religious duty well if it if we've not heard it if not change somebody's life because brother branham said you either leave here better or worse than you got here right and sometimes well i didn't get nothing out of that service well you know it's time to check up lord what what was i supposed to get out of this service and lots of times you know what it's a so it's a seed being sown i walked out i walked out of services and i had no idea what was said i was more confused when i got when i got out and it's like you know but you know what it's like well that was a waste of time well sometimes it's not a waste of time you know why because the lord put something in your way and you know what now it's time for you to do something about it what are you going to do about it why no because how many times have you heard i've heard preachers preach things and it just and it just i mean it just something just grabs a hold of me and i let me tell you i don't know what it is but it's just like this doesn't this is not what right with the word there's just i mean it just it sticks as they say it sticks in your crawl there's just something i mean it just i mean yeah the the spirit just it it just i mean you know it locks up i mean it's just like you get this warning it's like and then you're trying to figure out what the problem is but you don't know you know i think about when brother branham was reading the questions in in uh the seals when he's doing questions and answers you know he read the question wrong and then all of a sudden you know he stops in the middle of all that and he's like well who's sick what's going on you know because something called just like that was wrong but you know he didn't understand what was going on and then the brother tells him said read the question again and then he realizes oh i've read i've misread that he said then i spoke and realized oh i've answered the question wrong the holy ghost called him well you know sometimes i've had i've held on to questions for years and i could and it's just like i i you you see things but you you see things that brother branham said and things that are said people what people believe it's like but i don't see that and you just struggle with it and he and so you know god gives you those things and and not to not hate to say this but you know it's not like you're wrestling with it but you know it's something like mary you it's something you hold on to it say it said she heard the things that gabriel had said and the scripture said she pondered them in her heart and so you take the things that you've heard and you begin to work with those things and you know and because you know that's the i tell everybody i told brother dale many times i said the two best preach you know the two kinds of preachers that i like the good ones and the bad ones the good ones because they'll help you but sometimes the bad ones will put stuff out there and it's like what then all of a sudden it's like well you know what i'm going to study up on that they say you know when you hear something wrong it's like you go and ask somebody questions like well what do you think explain this show me and then you then you have you know some brother or something or even when you have a question how many times have you ever had a question about something you're reading and you're and you're looking at something and just like philip in the in the eunuch you know he's sitting there reading all this stuff and philip shows up and says hey do you understand what you're reading no i don't is he speaking to someone else or he's speaking of himself and then all of a sudden philip begins to speak the word to him it begins to open up how many times have you heard you know you're sitting there reading something you don't understand and all of a sudden brother brown said that god was obligated to put a man behind the pulpit to answer the question how many times have you ever read something or you heard something and it's like you're dwelling on that and the person sitting behind the pulpit opens up and begins to speak on that very subject and all of a sudden it's like oh i see that now and sometimes it's so simple but you know what it takes god to open it up it's not it's not us but it's god's leading us begin to speak the word to us so it's us let him be in the way be if we're in christ let him lead that's right see there's only one place is to be in christ if you're in christ it's not it it's it's not just our own way of going right but he said i am the way the truth and the life there's a he has he has a wife for us and many times we look back over our lives and we wonder why things happen the way that they do and the things that have happened and we question things and just like you know all things work together for the good and it's like well lord i'm trying to find the good in it and you know it takes minutes sometimes it takes many many years for us to get to the point where we can look back and say well thank the lord for all those problems why because we've been on we've been on this journey for a long time we've been on this road on this journey we've been in the way but many times you know people can get discouraged along the way but as brother brown said you know god's made the promise it's god's promise to you to lead you and so this is from um this is from melchizedek the great prince and king in 1955 brother says and now we've found salvation that will save us from sin that would take the vilest woman or man drunkard prostitute and make them a child of god well that same faith that same power that will lift up a fallen man or woman like that it'll work for us in many different ways it'll heal our bodies if you can just find the right approach you've got to find how to do it like if i had a farm over on this hill full of good grain and excuse me it's just about death on a count of water and i've got an artesian well on this side of the hill well i can't make that artesian well throw the water down here and up this side of the hill to water it but i've got to survey that land and find out how that water will take its own current and course and come around and water that crop it'll do it if we just let it run its own channel he said and that's the same thing the holy ghost is in god's promise he said if we'll just let it run its way and not us get in the way not us throw our doubts there because this didn't or that didn't just let god's holy spirit working in you rest upon that promise it'll do it just exactly what god said so if we if we have a way then we just don't let let ourselves get in the way but knowing that he's got the way he is the way and his and and so he said all we got to do is have the right approach to find the way that god wants to work so we understand that i i you know then we know to find out what god wants us to do many times we have problems in our lives and and the biggest problem that we have is we kind of mess with it that's right you know i i think it's donnie's got a sign at the shop and you know it's mechanic fees and you know one of them is so many dollars if if you want the mechanic to fix it but you know it's more if you want it if you want it done fast if you want it done correct but you know one of the highest fees that you have to pay one of the highest mechanics one is you if you've worked on it before you have to pay more than anybody else it's not it's the highest bill why because you've messed with it and many times we want we want god to fix our problems and the problem is is we've muddled with it and we won't get our hands out of it you know the little story about the little boy that had the toy and he wanted his daddy to fix it and he said son he said i'm never going to be able to fix it if you don't turn it loose but the problem is is we want to model with it we wanted well i got i got you know you know it's like it's like people when you when you try to tell them the right way to go when they when there's a right way to the right way to approach something and you've got people and it's like no i can do it this way you know one of the worst things if you're in the if you're in a trade if you're a carpenter or you're a plumber or anything else brother gary can tell you and then somebody's like oh i got a cheaper way i got a guy that can do it cheaper and you got somebody that read something on the internet and they're gonna be a diyer and they're gonna they're gonna try to do something [Music] but you know what if you don't follow the principles there's people that's had pictures and you see receptacles standing in the wall and water shooting out the receptacle and they said do i need a plumber or an electrician why because somebody don't know what they're doing amen but somebody thinks oh i'm going to do this and i'm going to do that the problem is is the same way you know god wants us to realize you know what we're not capable of doing everything you know the problem is is we need to step back and say lord i'm going to turn this over to you people have battled things for years and years and years and they go going around the same mountain facing the same problem and you know what the problem is is they're still holding on to it they're still waiting on god to do it and it's like well you know what you've never let go of it you've never put it in god's hands and wall and just and many times the problem is is when we when we get to the place where we put it in god's hands and we take a step back it's like well lord you ain't touched it yet lord jain touched it yet well you know what you put in god's hands and you know what you don't worry about it when you go out and plant a field fill a you know a great crop you know waden them you want to done all that planting out there you don't run out the next day and after see if it no see if them seeds are still there no you know what you prepare the ground that's right you've prepared the ground so you know what we're gonna go through there we're gonna get all the rocks out we're gonna get all the weeds out we're gonna get everything that's not conducive to what we're trying to get done as soon as we get all of that scraped up and thrown out then what we do we need to find out what what's in the soil so when we check the soil what kind of fertilizer it need what fertilizer needs to be added into it so when we figure out exactly what we're trying to grow and what's because you know the worst kind of crops you can get is when you're out there playing and the soul is is absolutely devoid of whatever your whatever the needs so if it needs nitrogen or whatever else and then you know and in there you know what you're wasting your time so what do you do you go down there and you can test and find out what needs to be done well then you got to get the right fertilizer well that's the same thing with you and i when when we have a problem then you know it's like well i'm going to figure this out on my own no i need to go back to the word of god i need to get into the word because you know what if if i'm sick then you know what the scriptures that talk about god's healing that god's healing power then you know that is what i'm claiming by the scripture first peter 2 24 tells us he said by his stripes we were healed past tense so you know what if i need healing then you know what it's already a finished work of calvary he took the stripes on his back and you know what it's it it's a it's a great dishonor and it's it's a it is a great disservice to god when when we come and he took those stripes on his back when he went through all of that for us to stand there and doubt what he said he would do when he came here he come all the way through he was scorched rejected mocked all the things that he suffered in this life to bring you eternal life when we look and see what what he done for us and he took those stripes on his back all the things that he went through in this life that he had to struggle and pay for all the no human man could go through the suffering that he went through but you know when he went through all of that then he rose from the dead and conquered and took the the keys of death hell in the grave he took the keys and he gave us overcoming power that the scripture tells us he said that we're joined we're heirs of god and joint heirs with christ that he's an overcomer that you and i are more than conquerors through him that loved us then if he's overcome these things then you know what it's a dishonor and it's a disservice to god to stand up lord will you heal me well i don't know if the lord's going to heal me or not that's right you know it's it's a you know because but that's that's the human nature that's the way the devil wants to bring it and i want you to approach it as you know god's not going to do something why it's already done it's just like people you know people seeking the holy ghost he said he wanted to give it to you more than you wanted well if well if it's a finished work that he's that he's given it and he sent his word to us what is the problem it's with us as brother brown said one of the problems that we have he said because people are not taught the new birth he said many people just sympathize with it but he said they've not been taught the truth and many people they get to this place where the holy ghost is some kind of hocus pocus something but you know what there's a there's a sure way a sure foundation to be built upon that will lead you and guide you that way just one just when you when god calls you wherever you were out in the world out in sin wherever you was on a loading dock or you know wherever that god comes and speaks to you wherever you were at then when god comes and speaks to you then you know what you had to do is you had to accept him when you were in church and and you were just sitting in there and maybe you were maybe you were there because you wanted to see some girl or some guy or mom and daddy made you but somewhere along the way god called your heart spoke to you and called you and you answered that call well you know what you didn't have to do anything to do that you had to take god at his word well because he began to call to you and when he began to call to you then you answered that call and said yes lord i realize i'm lost i'm lost and i need a savior and i heard your call and i want to answer that call lord i want you to be the lord of my life and then you know what there's the foundation that you lay that you understand and say lord i understand that i need to be baptized and when you come and he said when you repent he said and then you be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins then you understand this is this is my act upon your word because i've taken you because you've spoke to me that i need to that i need that i understand the condition that i'm in and i understand that you've called to me to bring me to this place and so i'm stepping forward and then when you understand that i need to be baptized well lord i'm going to the water why because i'm going to fulfill your word lord i'm going to do what you asked me to do well then you know what when you lay that foundation he said and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost well then you know what when you've done your part then you know what he's obligated to do his part then we understand that through the opening of the word when you walk with him in the word then you know then hey you still fight you still fight the same flesh you still got the same desires you go through the same struggles one because it's still a battle but you know what you're still holding on to the word one because one of the one day as you begin to understand you become taking on the word then you start to understand hey when i get closer to god then you know what the things of the world lose their attraction but you know what the devil is trying to pull you that way he's like well lord you know what i still got a temper and i still got all these things that keep pulling me back but you know what we got to understand there's grace there why because he called you to begin with then he's going to cover you but you got to keep coming back that's right you know i i think about oh uh jim brown i was like brother carol always used to talk about jim brown you know the great big uh running back for fullback for cleveland you know jim brown you know he played and people just and the first thing all they wanted to do as soon as they got on the field with jim brown they said man we're going we're going to knock him out today we're going to hurt him and that was all they done and they would run at gym with everything they had and they knocked him down and he'd get up and he just dusted himself off get right back in the huddle and it was like and the guys that were hitting him and just about knocked himself out and it's like i don't understand why he's like that and you know what and jim always told him he said i'm not ever going to let the enemy the other opposing team let i'm never going to let them know that they hurt me he said i get up every single time he said i dust myself off he said i get back in the huddle he said i do it again and again amen and so it's the same way you know we don't allow the devil to get in the way and try to hold us back what do we do you know hey we're going to fall you're going to sin you're going to have these problems but what do you do you go back and you get back under the blood and you put it all under the blood and you know what then you move on we don't we don't have to harp on the things that we've done in the past why because if god is faithful if he's called us to this journey if he's called us to this way then brothers and sisters then you know what he's putting it under the blood and he's forgot about it then you know what he's called you into this journey to continue on [Applause] but if he's called you that way then you know what it's our job we're obligated pardon me for a second choosing dad amen thank you i was stepping on some i kept trying to figure out where i was going standing on my shoestring yeah me too that would be a bad thing but anyway but you know what when we get on this on in the way then he's made a way then you know what god don't want you to stop god don't want you get tied up in the things of the past but you know we spend more time dwelling on the things of the past and you know somebody will say something to us and you know we get we get so we we we'll spend all day worried about things of the past and you know many times we get to the place you know we've got to come to have confidence in god and understand those things are past you know when it's under the blood then then you know what then we don't we need to just work on purging our mind getting these things out why because the way to do that is we need to get into the word and get into the place because the scripture tells me there isn't therefore now no condemnation amen those that are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit well then you know what if i'm in the spirit if i'm walking after him then you know this is the way that he wants me to go then you know what i don't need to worry about the past but you know what there comes a day because you know as the more we walk in the word and the more we walk in the word and the more we meditate on the word then you know what it does is it pushes the old man out it pushes that unclean spirit out it's got it's got to come out why because the word is coming forth and there's a process in that but you know what you know if you fall within time to get back up and continue on and don't dwell on the past and then just keep going forward but you know as we see in the word as we begin to walk in that and dwell in that and meditate in that then you know what that unclean spirit's got to be driven out and then you know because it's it's a promise of god for that to take place then the same token as you live in the word and you dwell in the word and you meditate in the word then you know what you have faith in god that the the holy ghost will come and take up residence why because he promised it but it's the same it's the same faith you just continue to walk day by day by day and meditate in the word and he's obligated to come to you and you know what you do is you stand there and you bring the word to god because he said that he wants you to bring him the word brother branham said he said you become the word as you feed on the word and he said he'll quicken the word as you bring the word to him so what do we do we continue to hold the word then i'm not giving up i want because i have i have this great promise have this great promises laid out before me that you know i can just keep walking i'm walking in the way that god has called me to but you know many times the problem that we get into in our in our walk brother bran was talking about and he was talking about talking about the way of holiness in a highway of holiness and he talks about and there's a way and brother bram talks about when you get into this way you know he said you can be in the he said you can be in the highway and be in the gutter but he said he said but where you need to be is in the middle he said because there's this highway and he said there's a post on one side the post on other you see this great road to be that's laid out in front of you and he said when you're walking he said you need to get up on the highway the way up in the in the middle he said that because that's where the main he said that's where the smooth so when we get in there see many times we get over on one side we get over here too far this way and we get too far over here on this side and you know we get we get distracted you know i got to you know leave i was learning how to drive and let me tell you something it's like listen and i know he i know he's not going to like this but you know but you know when you drive you you got to follow the the rules of the road and one of the things i told him i said what's the what is the what's the proper speed for you to be driving and he just gives you this blank look the proper speed for you to be driving a vehicle that we insure is a speed that you can properly handle that vehicle it's not what's posted on that black and white sign out there because if it's 45 and you think you're gonna drive more than that and you can't handle it no you need to be about 35. you need you need to know how fast you can handle this car you know many times he gets he gets distracted with things and and you know then all of a sudden he's trying to he's trying to make turns on two whales like he's driving in the dukes of hazard or something and it's like listen listen listen you slow this thing down one day we were out driving and he was all he was all over the place we was going we were i think it was thanksgiving was going up nicole's my sister's house he's out on the road next thing i know pull this truck over over over he looked at me like i was what over right here side of the road this paved area right here you see this paved area right here we're gonna park the truck right there out of everybody's way and let me tell you something let me explain something to you when the roads get narrow and there's there's a ditch on this side and you're weaving across the double yellow yellow line going this way because you're trying to weave you're going too fast you're going the wrong way because if you can't handle and when you get four or five cars behind you on a two-lane road you find a spot on the side of the road and pull a truck over and let everybody pass you if you're a sunday driver on wednesday or any other day of the week but if you're a sunday driver and you're out on the side of the road you're going down the road and this posted speed limit and you think there's a parade going on it's time for you to be courteous and pull the vehicle over and let everybody else pass and they don't cost you nothing either but you know when you do this but i pulled him over and i want to talk to him listen we need to have we need to have a little conversation because when you get back on the road then you need to straighten up and many times that's what god wants us to do god wants us to have his little side roadside chat got to pull you over to the side and he won't have talk with you he pulled you over and said listen you're going the wrong way you're going to look too much this way a little bit too much that way you got your eyes in the rearview mirror and you ain't going in the right direction that's right and all of a sudden you know we got to slow it down so we can get in the right direction amen so you know many times god wants us wants us to be mindful of what we're doing god has a has a way for us to go and we need to be mindful of that that god has called us and we need to follow that path when we get wrapped up in things of the world or things of of this life and we get so wrapped up in things you know what then we as as mary when when gabriel had come and spoke to her and told her gabriel had come and told now they set up joseph and mary sat out there and read the scrolls and talked about that god was going to sin the messiah that they knew that that that was what isaiah said they read the scriptures this is what was going that he was gonna fulfill these scriptures the old testament prophets talked about it david talked about it in the psalms all these things were going to take place and they talked about it but when mary come when gabriel come to tell mary about it and then she's like well how can these things be well you know what all god wants you to do is believe how how can these things be sin i know not a man what would gabriel tell her the holy ghost is going to overshadow you amen oh and so all you need to do is believe just trust in what he said and then she said be it unto me according to thy word so she took exactly what he said and she held on to that even even when she went lived in a world of ridicule and all these things that even even when joseph didn't understand what was going on but you know what joseph had to come to his place and he had to have a revelation whether the lord could speak to him and tell him this is what's going to take place this is what's taking place but then years later after after he was born and she had raised and uh you know we've seen we've seen the the shepherds and and the wise men and all these things that happened and then simeon prophesy and a prophesying all these things that took place all the way through the journey and then and then one day she's like your father and i yeah salt you with tears after all that time god's speaking to and then we we deny the the testimony deny the word and so it's the same thing we can we after all the things that we've been through and then we stand and deny the word and it's like well i i don't i don't i don't doubt the word brother wait i don't it's just like i don't see how this is going to take place and it's like well you know i don't i don't want to doubt the word but you know the words that come out of my mouth is doubting the word man it's like we're going to what i'm not going to say nothing as they say you know we energize our our mouth before our brains engage and we begin to speak things and you know it's just like we speak things one because the devil tells us that amen well you know you know just whatever comes but you know that's what the holy ghost wants us to do is stop no i'm not listening to that god made a way and so when when he when he brought me this far and he's done all these things when you when you look at the things that god has done for you in the past and you say well i don't know if god's gonna you know it's it's it's a total it's a total disrespect to god dishonoring god when you look back and you sit down and just write down and think about all the things god's done for you up to this point in your life when you when you when you've got when you've gotten jobs when nobody else has gotten jobs when you don't when i when i got the and you know i i tell everybody and i i i want to share it with you and and a lot of y'all know but you know i i lost i was working for a company lost the keys to the truck lost keys to the van couldn't find them anywhere we searched high and low and everything else couldn't find them anywhere but you know we after after searching i went i was praying that night i was down and like lord we need those keys because we gotta do the job tomorrow and i don't know where they're at nobody knows where they're at and i went to bed that night and brother ron spencer come to me in a dream and you know where ron you know he's just all happy and joel field you know just grinding from mid-air like like you know everything and and i i was just so torn up i was like brother ron i said i don't know where those keys are and i said you know we need them and he told me brother and don't worry about it god knows where those keys are he said don't you worry about them well the next morning when we got to the shop we had a we got a little shop out beside the man's house and they had a little barbecue grill sat there we had this little container behind it we put drink you know aluminum cans in but it's solid black grill sitting there right by the door and my keys had a had a plastic number one about that tall it was orange and let me tell you something if you put orange on top of a solid black object it stands out and when you've got people walking past that door in and out all the time somebody would see an orange tag standing on top of a solid black barbecue grill but you know we no we nobody saw that but the next morning when we got there those van keys were sitting on top of that barbecue grill [Music] it's like you know what because i have a heavenly father that is interested in the little things in my life and when i got laid off from that job i was sitting at the house at my i was looking at my computer screen and we were getting ready to go the fellowship meeting was a and the fellowship meeting was over by the homers and i was sitting there one night that day and i was just looking at the computer screen and i was thinking you know i'm trying to find a job and you know you just get so frustrated with things sometimes and and you don't know what to do and i was just sitting there and the lord comes spoke to me and he said do you know who's preaching the fellowship meeting today hadn't thought of it up until that point but brother ron was preaching that day and i went to the fellowship meeting that day and i was sitting there i was talking to brother ron i think the first time brother ron was here he when he uh i'd been the second time we were standing back here in the back i was telling him about losing those car keys and i was talking about him coming to me in that dream but i went in there we sat down over to over at the church and you know we're sitting there eating i was telling brother ron about this job and i told him i said you you remember about the dream about you coming to me trying to find those keys i said well i said i'm looking for trying to find this job and i've got openings and avenues or whatever leads and i said nothing's panning out you know and brother ron told me said brother he said you just believe and he said i'll pray and it wasn't long after that i got the job that i got now i started in a different department than the one i wanted to be in but i got in the door and i was talking to a man one day he was my team leader and i was telling him and and they they asked me so they asked me about my resume and everything i said well they got my resume everybody's got my resume everything's taken care of and he said he told me said you need to go talk to this man so i went up there and i talked to him and i told him who it was and he said oh yeah i got your resume just show you how the lord works he he puts people in your path that you need to in the ways that you need to go but i went and i talked to him and then they come back later and they told me said listen you've got a set maintenance assessment you need to take and they let me take time off to go take that assessment to get it done i took took me two days i've done one half of one day and the other half i went and worked you know the first part and they let me take some time off go do it and that guy put me in the right direction lamarra he told me i went took that and he called uh he told me he said well you've got to interview this afternoon so i went to the interview so i didn't hear from for like a day and the next day lamar come by and told me said listen you start maintenance the monday or the tuesday after memorial day and i've been there ever since and i've had people tell me that he's like well how did you how did you get that so we had my we had resumes in and we ain't heard nothing from maintenance nobody said anything to us and i told them i said it's not what you know it's who you know [Applause] but see the thing is we don't get don't get worried don't get worried up or worked up about it don't worry about it why because he's made a way for you just follow what god wants you to do just go the way that he wants you to go i just want to i just want to cover this one little part right here before we finish but this is first samuel chapter 15 and we know that as saul and saul became the king you know he left the way that he started he left that humility he got away because he wanted to be himself and he didn't want to follow and be a to be led of god you know and you know this the scripture tells us there you know the it says and then the the came the word of the lord unto samuel saying it repenteth me that i have set up saul to be king for he has turned back from following me and have not performed my commandments and it grieves samuel and he cried unto the lord all night and when samuel rose early to beat saul in the morning it was told samuel saying saul came to carmel and behold he set him up a place and has gone about and passed on and gone down to gilgal and samuel came to saul and saul said unto him blessed be thou of the lord i have performed the commandment of the lord and samuel said what meaneth then this bleeding of the sheep and mine ears and the lowing of the oxen which i heard and saul said they have brought them from the amalekites for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice unto the lord thy god and the rest we have utterly destroyed then samuel said unto saul stay and i will tell thee what the lord hath said to me this night and he said unto him say on and samuel said when thou was little and thine on sight was thou not made the head of the tribes of israel and the lord anointed thee king over israel when he was little in his own sight when he was humble to what god had said and the lord sent thee on a journey and said go and utterly destroy the sinners the amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed therefore then this thou not obey the voice of the lord but did fly upon the spool and it's evil in the sight of the lord and samuel said unto saul yeah i have obeyed the voice of the lord and have gone the way which the lord sent me and have brought a gag the king of amalek and have utterly destroyed the malachites but the people took of the spool sheep and oxen the chief things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto the lord thy god and gilgal and samuel said hath the lord as great delight and burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams so when he begins to speak there then the lord had spoke to samuel and told him listen you need to go talk to saul and this is where saul is and you go and talk to him and you tell him but hearing all of this when the prophet stands before saul and tells him you've not obeyed the voice of the lord oh no i follow i've done what the lord wanted me to do well i followed it no you didn't and that's the reason i'm here saul the lord told me i'm gonna tell you what the lord told me last night don't don't argue with me saul because the lord told me this and the lord i'm not saying this this ain't coming from samuel this ain't coming from the pastor this ain't coming from some preacher but it's coming from god they listen you've not followed what you were told to do but listen we're gonna we're gonna take these great things that that that we have fallen upon that the lord has blessed us with these things and we're going to sacrifice them to the lord see well this is this is the way we want it to work out well the lord's blessed me with these things no you need to get rid of them people want to hold on to things and the devil and and the devil wants you to hold on to him that's what the devil is trying to tell you and the lord's trying to tell you you need to get rid of this stuff well you know it's going to work out great don't worry no god told him said listen all this stuff that's in your way these enemies don't leave nothing and utterly destroy it so when the things of the world are in the way and all these things they when all these things the old man and all these things that we fight you know we're not supposed to pet it it's to be utterly destroyed to flee from it right right he said hath the lord as great delight and burn offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken the fat of rams so god didn't want all their sacrifices anyway god wanted somebody to be honest and follow the word amen is what he's told in the in the new testament you know he was not he was not in into sacrifices and offerings was not what he was wanting but he said a honest and contrite heart he wanted somebody to believe him somebody to follow the word not to offer a bunch of sacrifices he said for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou hast rejected the word of the lord he hath also rejected thee from being king and saul said unto samuel i have sinned for i have transgressed the commandment of the lord and thy words because i feared the people and obeyed their voice because you know what he listened to ever he listened to the people well well that okay we'll we'll just we'll just we'll just do it this way we you know one of the toughest jobs that you ever have is being a boss it's being a leader being a leader being in a leadership position because you know what some of the things that you have to do in life is not fun just like being a parent not everything about being a parent is always fun but you know what you're obligated to do it and everybody's like well we'll just let it slide this time well we'll just let it slide it'll be okay people people wonder why you know if you just pa pet the devil in your kids and you let them get by with everything and then you wonder why they turn out the way they do you know when when you when you have when you're in a a pastor when you when you're the shepherd of the flock you know i've never i've never seen i've never seen a church and i and i've i've said this times before but you you watch it you watch a church when when when they get when things happen and you may and you make a place for the devil why why is that why is it so important when sin come into camp because when when uh aiken committed his sin and joshua they stopped everything why because god told them listen they're sin in the camp there was a time listen now's the time we're going to stop all this and he started weeding it out until he figured out who the problem was so you know and you see churches when you allow things to take place and and things and nobody corrects these things then you know what all of a sudden then when when those things take place and somebody turns a blind eye and they don't listen to it and they don't correct it you start watching because the next thing you know the things that they start preaching out of the pulpit is an error why because when you allow the devil to come in when he gets his foot holding you watch and see if it don't start affecting the ministry i've never i've never seen it once where when they start getting in next thing you know it's going to affect everything why because you what what so it's so important it is it's such an important part to lay a hold of all that and and and people say well i don't understand why why why the preacher don't get a hold of don't do this or that well you know what you're not the pastor i'm not the pastor and you know what it takes it takes the holy ghost to work and you know there's people saying well you know what if it was me i would i would just kick them people oh yo you know i would just it's like you know what you wait on the lord and many times people people say well you know if i do i want to do it this way or whatever then you'd find out what if we'd have done it the way that you wanted it done it'd be an utter mess it'd be chaos but you know what he takes the pastor and he has to deal with some of those things and you know he has to bear those burdens and but you know what there's a time when when if you keep holding it before the lord then you know what then all of a sudden then it'll take place there's something that the lord will speak and something will take place and then the word will come forth and it'll address that a situation but sometimes you know if we try to if we try to do it in our own selves then the problem is is you know we make a mess out of it and everybody's like well i don't understand why they don't do this why they don't under why they don't do that well how do you know that the lord ain't spoke to brother dale or brother wade or whoever about those situations people act like you know well if he you know just like when jesus was there and now that prostitute was down there washing his feet well if he knew what kind of woman that was he wouldn't let her wash his feet but you know what here's this ill-famed woman but she had more respect for the son of god than all those pharisees and all those religious leaders who thought they were so holy and pious and so great and this woman who knew who she was but she knew who he was and that she would honor him by taking and washing the feet washing his feet with her tears and drawing them with her hair why because they wouldn't do that one they had put him in a place to really kill and mock him but she saw who he was she didn't take into consideration who she was yeah she knew who she was but you know what she she saw the dishonor that was done to him and it was something that was inside of her to do that and it's all said unto samuel i have sinned for i have transgressed the commandment of the lord and thy words because i feared the people and obeyed their voice and therefore i pray thee pardon my sin and turn again with me that i may worship the lord and samuel said unto saul i will not return with thee for thou hast rejected the word of the lord and the lord hath rejected thee from being king over israel and as samuel turned about to go away he laid upon the skirt of his mantle and it rent and samuel said unto him the lord hath rent the kingdom of israel from thee this day and hath given it to a neighbor of thine that is better than thou and also the strength of israel will not lie nor repent for he is not a man that he should repent then he said i have sinned yet honor me now i pray thee before the elders of my people and before israel and turn again with me that i may worship the lord thy god so samuel turned again after saul and saul worshiped the lord then said samuel bring me hither to me again the king of the malachites and i got a guy came unto him delicately and again said surely the bitterness of death is passed and samuel said as thy sword hath made women childless so shall thy mother be childless among women and samuel cute again pieces before the lord and gilgal then samuel went to rama and saul went to his house and gibba of saul and samuel came no more to see samuel until the day of his death nevertheless samuel mourned for saul and the lord repented that he had made saul king over israel so and sisters it's a it's a serious thing to follow in the way that god has called us god's made us made a way but you know god's not god's not always going to be as we think god's not always going to be angry with us let's all let's all stay in this evening how the musicians come god's not always going to be angry with us that's right but you know what god is calling us to the place and if and if you've sinned then you know what god is calling you god will speak to you and you know what god is calling you back into fellowship amen god god is so good he's so gracious and if you and if you fail within you know what don't give up but you know if we start the way that that saul did seeing how humble he was then you know we all to keep that stay humble before the lord that we all that if we are a child of god you know then the holy ghost is inside of us to lead us then you know the the holy ghost is not one to just let us wander and do whatever the word has come to reach us and to bring us to the place where we need to be but don't but you know don't let the devil hold you back don't let the devil get in your way if you're in the way then you're in the in the right way then let lord show me the path in which i should travel that i need to walk amen lord show me where which way that i need to go
