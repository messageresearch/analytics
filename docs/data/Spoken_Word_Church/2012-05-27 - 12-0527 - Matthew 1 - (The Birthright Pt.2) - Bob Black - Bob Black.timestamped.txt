[0:00] turn to Matthew chapter
[0:08] 1 cuz that's really in the context of
[0:11] what we've been talking about is is the
[0:14] book of the generation of Jesus
[0:19] Christ
[0:27] brother we we're at Matthew chapter 1
[0:31] verse one the book of the generation of
[0:33] Jesus Christ the son of David the son of
[0:35] Abraham we'll just read a few verses
[0:37] Abraham begat Isaac and Isaac begat
[0:39] Jacob and Jacob begat Judas and his
[0:41] Brethren and Judas begat FZ and Zarah of
[0:44] Tamor and farz be ezam and ezam be Aram
[0:50] and Aram beat aminadab and aminadab be
[0:54] and they S Salon and a lot of people
[0:58] over the years have put um
[1:00] I was reading about St Augustine put
[1:02] devoted pretty much his entire life to
[1:05] rectifying what seems like problems
[1:08] between this genealogy and Luke's
[1:10] genealogy there's people missing there's
[1:12] people that um and the names seem to be
[1:17] different between Matthew and Luke but
[1:19] it's all there's a story here that's
[1:21] absolutely perfect that goes down from
[1:24] uh starting at Abraham and we were
[1:26] talking about the birthright and and
[1:27] kind of witnesses to the this coming son
[1:30] of David and how the birthright is going
[1:31] to be manifested in n in the natural
[1:34] people and a spiritual people and um
[1:38] when
[1:40] uh in Matthew it talks about the son of
[1:43] David the son of Abraham a son means to
[1:46] the Jews it meant it could mean grandson
[1:49] or um so that you could in Matthew it
[1:52] skips a few Generations here and there
[1:54] and I will go into that more more detail
[1:56] later but um what we were talking
[1:59] talking about in in last time was the
[2:02] birthright with Abraham so just to kind
[2:05] of uh this is a little bit confusing if
[2:07] you don't see where we're going um but
[2:10] just to kind of give an overview of how
[2:11] the birth right goes down through
[2:12] generations it starts at Abraham with
[2:15] the promise
[2:16] Covenant goes to Isaac and get gets
[2:19] every step it gets magnified more
[2:21] promises are uh the promises are
[2:24] magnified to Jacob and then uh you know
[2:28] what's really interesting is that each
[2:31] generation the the birthright is
[2:33] supposed to go to the firstborn but none
[2:35] of these are the firstborn uh if if you
[2:38] look at Isaac it should have been if you
[2:40] just look at the firstborn it should
[2:42] have been Israel Jacob should have been
[2:45] Esau uh Judah should have been
[2:50] Reuben and uh when you get to Jacob and
[2:53] and uh Reuben the first part was taken
[2:56] from Reuben and given not to Judah which
[2:59] is the genealogy but it's given to
[3:02] Joseph and eph and then uh further down
[3:05] the genealogy go through the children of
[3:07] Israel in the wilderness the um 40 years
[3:09] in the wilderness get down to
[3:11] Solomon so you got
[3:15] Solomon
[3:17] then the uh genealogies get split the
[3:22] riol which was the son of Solomon and
[3:28] Jobo
[3:31] and it's important to remember two of
[3:33] these major key points of the birth
[3:35] right is that there's a promise of of
[3:39] kings that we will become spiritual
[3:42] kings that we will Reign Over The World
[3:44] the Flesh the uh problems of that the
[3:48] devil brings against us and uh that is
[3:52] testified in rabol in judah's lineage
[3:56] because he's the he get we'll look at
[3:58] the scripture where it says that the
[3:59] scepter given to Judah but the birth
[4:02] right to Joseph and the birth right the
[4:04] other the other component of the birth
[4:06] right is that uh is the promise of many
[4:08] nations and as we follow it down Joseph
[4:11] and Ephraim uh eventually they'll get uh
[4:15] they go into captivity in Assyria and U
[4:18] they go they the 10 lost tribes that get
[4:20] dispersed amongst the world dispersed to
[4:23] all the many nations that's a natural
[4:26] type a natural the natural part of the
[4:29] promise but the spiritual part of the
[4:31] promise is that we by taking on the Seed
[4:34] of Abraham the spiritual seed we can
[4:36] stand next to these and say we have
[4:39] Abraham to our father too not by a
[4:42] natural genealogy but by spiritual
[4:44] genealogy because just like uh
[4:48] Christ had uh the birth right was given
[4:51] to the son so the birth right was given
[4:53] to from Abraham to Isaac Isaac to Jacob
[4:56] but Jesus when he came he didn't have a
[4:58] natural father neither did he have a
[5:00] natural son he had to give an air to us
[5:03] the air was to the spiritual seed and uh
[5:06] his spiritual father was was God
[5:10] um so let's
[5:14] uh let's go back and look
[5:19] at let's see we're just kind of looking
[5:22] at what the birthright is I got in
[5:24] trouble years ago for uh I was uh
[5:27] telling a little Bible story to this
[5:29] Ministry brothers that was visiting my
[5:31] family and I was telling about how the
[5:33] birthright is the I was telling the
[5:35] story of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and I
[5:37] said the birth right is uh the promise
[5:40] of the Holy Ghost cuz that's really what
[5:42] all the the birthright promises are
[5:44] looking forward to Jesus one day coming
[5:47] so um you'd be surprised how many people
[5:51] um and not knocking off anybody or
[5:53] anything it it's just something a little
[5:56] truth that um just keep in mind as as we
[5:59] go through this and here's what brother
[6:01] Rand said about the birthright and
[6:03] hearing recognizing acting on the word
[6:04] of God and I I read this last time I
[6:07] just to re redo it now anyone knows that
[6:11] the Seal of God is the birthright the
[6:13] baptism of the Holy
[6:15] Ghost Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the
[6:18] holy spirit of God whereby your seal
[6:19] till the day of your Redemption when
[6:21] they were born again they were filled
[6:23] with the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is
[6:25] the new birth we know that you're
[6:26] begotten of the spirit I'll admit that
[6:30] and then uh hearing receiving and acting
[6:34] in 1960 he says and the
[6:37] birthright let me see he's talking about
[6:40] Jacob um the birthright been nothing to
[6:43] Esau frankly he despised it and I say
[6:46] this with all reverence his children
[6:47] still does that's right he despises it
[6:49] and the birthright is the holy spirit we
[6:51] already know that and the carnal
[6:53] believer despises that oh he said them
[6:55] days are pass there's no such a thing as
[6:57] receiving the Holy Ghost anymore that
[6:59] was back in the apostles time in the in
[7:02] the church age book he said when Ahab
[7:04] married Jezebel for political reasons he
[7:06] sold his Birthright he join up you join
[7:09] up with an organization and you sell
[7:11] your Birthright brother whether you want
[7:13] to believe it or not every Protestant
[7:15] group that ever came out and then went
[7:16] back sold their Birthright and when you
[7:18] sell your Birthright you're just like
[7:20] Esau you can cry and repent all you want
[7:22] but it won't do you any good there's
[7:24] only one thing you can do and that is
[7:26] come out of her my people and stop
[7:28] partaking of her sins
[7:30] now if you don't think I am right just
[7:31] answer this one question can any man
[7:34] living tell me what church or what move
[7:36] of God ever had Revival and came back
[7:38] after she went into organization and
[7:40] became a denomination read your history
[7:43] you can't find one not even
[7:45] one so uh all of these Birthright
[7:48] blessings speak of the coming of the
[7:51] blessings that are part of the new birth
[7:54] and the first one we want to look at is
[7:56] um Deuteronomy 21
[8:14] verse 15 through
[8:24] 17 if a man have two wives one beloved
[8:28] and another hated
[8:30] and they have born in children both the
[8:31] Beloved and the
[8:33] hated and if the firstborn son be hers
[8:35] that was hated then it shall be when he
[8:38] maketh his sons to inherit that which he
[8:40] hath that he may not make the son of the
[8:42] Beloved firstborn before the son of the
[8:44] hated which is indeed the firstborn but
[8:47] he shall acknowledge the son of the Hat
[8:49] the firstborn by giving him a double
[8:51] portion of all that he hath for he is
[8:54] the beginning of his strength the ride
[8:56] of the firstborn is his so the the
[8:59] firstborn or the the the right of the
[9:01] birth right of the firstborn is to get a
[9:03] double
[9:04] portion and you know brother bandam
[9:06] talked about the double portion being a
[9:08] type of Christ in the church that Christ
[9:10] uh like just like Elijah went to glory
[9:12] and uh a double portion of his Spirit
[9:14] was put back on the church to do Greater
[9:18] Works to you know Jesus was in one place
[9:20] but now the bride is spread around all
[9:22] all around the world so um more Works
[9:26] can be
[9:28] done
[9:29] just like uh just like the double
[9:31] portion that came back on Elijah so the
[9:34] double portion is all through scripture
[9:36] that the promise and um another thing to
[9:39] note is the firstborn is supposed to get
[9:42] the birth right but the birth right just
[9:43] like the Holy Ghost is transferable if
[9:46] you don't if you don't accept it uh you
[9:49] know just like uh Esau or ishma well is
[9:53] Esau um Turned down the birthright it
[9:57] was even to Jacob Reuben because of his
[9:59] actions he slept with his father's uh
[10:02] conbine I think and uh it was given to
[10:05] Judah or
[10:10] Joseph so you got to
[10:13] um you got to accept
[10:17] it
[10:19] um Another Blessing was Genesis
[10:23] 27
[10:27] 29 Genesis
[10:46] 27 oh let's see Genesis 27 let start at
[10:50] verse
[10:52] 26 this is Isaac blessing Jas Jacob and
[10:56] his father Isaac said unto him come near
[10:58] now and kiss kiss me my son and he came
[11:00] near and kissed him and he smelled the
[11:02] smell of his rment and blessed him and
[11:04] said see the smell of my son is as the
[11:07] smell of a field which the Lord has
[11:10] blessed now everybody everybody pins
[11:13] Jacob down as being such a Shyer and a
[11:15] little uh kind of a naughty boy but how
[11:19] much worse was it what Esau did that he
[11:22] bued the birthright the promises of God
[11:24] he valued it so little that he would
[11:26] trade it for a just a little piece of
[11:28] cenal soup that always think about that
[11:31] when I'm in the grocery store and see
[11:32] the lenel that's what Esau traded his
[11:34] Birthright
[11:36] for therefore God give thee of the Dew
[11:38] of Heaven and the fatness of the earth
[11:40] and plenty of corn and wine let people
[11:42] serve thee and Nations bow down to thee
[11:45] be Lord over thy Brethren and let thy
[11:46] mother's sons bow down to thee cursed be
[11:49] everyone that curseth thee and blessed
[11:51] be the be he that blessed thee so he
[11:55] gives them a promise of of natural
[11:58] plenty that he'll be blessed with the
[12:00] fatness of the land and plenty of corn
[12:01] and wine everything he has need of
[12:04] because God is Jehovah J our
[12:08] provider uh people will let people serve
[12:11] thee Nations will bow down before him um
[12:14] he'll be Lord over his Brethren and um
[12:17] everyone that curses them will be cursed
[12:19] and everyone that blesses them will be
[12:20] blessed and that's some good promises to
[12:23] lay cl to um so we got this promise of a
[12:28] many nations that uh Kings will come out
[12:31] of them we've also got another promise
[12:33] of a priesthood because the um the first
[12:37] born until the Levites were the first
[12:40] born was the the priest of the home he
[12:43] was um he led the family in sacrifice he
[12:48] taught his family the way of forgiveness
[12:50] was through the shed blood that there
[12:51] was a covering for
[12:54] sin and
[12:56] uh he was the uh
[12:59] I guess the the word was revealed to the
[13:02] the one with the firstborn so that he
[13:03] could impart it to you know Isaac the
[13:06] word came to him when he when he blessed
[13:08] Jacob after he blessed him he said and
[13:10] he will be blessed because he knew that
[13:12] it was it was something that God gave
[13:15] him um so he was the communicator of the
[13:18] Divine secret now think about this in
[13:20] the context of your Holy Ghost
[13:21] experience that God's word is revealed
[13:23] to you if you're born of the Holy Ghost
[13:26] just like the birthright the firstborn
[13:28] birth orite in the Old Testament was the
[13:30] communicator of the divine secrets to
[13:33] his family and taught his family the way
[13:35] to live the firstborn was supposed to
[13:38] live a consecrated life to live a holy
[13:41] life for his family and and the world
[13:43] and to make intercession for his
[13:47] family and let's look at for an example
[13:50] and make an intercession let's look at
[13:52] Genesis
[13:57] 25
[14:07] oh I might have rot the wrong one
[14:21] now
[14:27] second
[14:35] well this is when uh Rebecca was I'm
[14:39] sorry I can't find it but I I'll just
[14:40] tell you what it is Rebecca uh was bar
[14:44] and it's the scripture where it says um
[14:46] oh here it is verse
[14:52] 2521 let's start at verse
[14:55] 20 and Isaac was 40 years old when he
[14:57] took Rebecca to wife the daughter of
[15:00] Bethel the Syrian of PanAm the sister to
[15:02] laan the
[15:03] Syrian and Isaac entreated the Lord for
[15:06] his wife because she was bued and the
[15:08] Lord was intreated of him and Rebecca
[15:10] his wife conceived so Isaac had the
[15:14] birthright and he uh interceded for his
[15:16] family and that's uh I think that's an
[15:19] important part to remember if if you
[15:21] fill with the Holy Ghost you can you
[15:23] definitely have the right to intercede
[15:25] for your family if I I remember many
[15:28] times
[15:29] through my marriage my wife will wake up
[15:31] in the middle of the night and say I'm
[15:32] hurting somewhere or whatever you just
[15:33] leave lay your hand on her and pray for
[15:35] her in the middle of the night and
[15:36] everything will be all right and it um
[15:40] it bothers me if if that doesn't happen
[15:43] if you you know you pray for somebody
[15:45] and
[15:46] something your prayer is not answered it
[15:48] should bother all of us because this is
[15:51] a Birthright blessing to us that we have
[15:53] a right to intercede and to call on God
[15:56] for the things we have need of
[16:01] um let's look at Exodus
[16:15] 22 verse
[16:26] 29 God took he was going to take the
[16:29] firstborn and then later on he took the
[16:31] Levis instead and we'll go through how
[16:33] that came
[16:34] about Thou shalt not delay to offer the
[16:37] first of thy right fruits and of thy
[16:39] Liquors the firstborn of thy son shalt
[16:41] thou give unto me so the first born was
[16:44] always pecul peculiar know the firstborn
[16:48] was always always consecrated to God I'm
[16:50] not going to try to say that word
[16:53] um and they were next in honor to their
[16:55] parents let's go to Genesis 49
[17:01] verses 3 and
[17:11] four this is where Jacob called all his
[17:13] sons together and he's telling that
[17:15] Reuben you were the first born but
[17:17] you're not going to get the birth right
[17:19] verse three uh let's start at verse two
[17:22] gather yourselves together and hear ye
[17:24] sons of Jacob and hearken unto Israel
[17:26] your father Reuben Thou Art my first
[17:28] born my might the beginning of my
[17:30] strength the Excellency of dignity and
[17:32] the Excellency of power unstable as
[17:35] water Thou shalt not Excel because thou
[17:37] wentest up to thy father's bed then
[17:39] defiles thou it he went up to my
[17:42] couch so uh even though Ruben didn't get
[17:46] it this is still an example of how the
[17:48] the firstborn is is is the
[17:51] uh they're next after their father their
[17:55] parents because they're in line to
[17:57] receive the blessings of the
[17:59] birthright in Deuteronomy 21 it talked
[18:02] about the double
[18:04] portion and then uh second Chron I'll
[18:08] just read it 2 Chronicles
[18:10] 21:3 uh uh the the
[18:15] uh this is where Jehosaphat is
[18:19] um jeor succeeded Jehoshaphat and he
[18:22] said and their father gave them great
[18:24] gifts of silver and of gold and of
[18:25] precious things with fent cities in
[18:27] Judah but the kingdom gave he to jehoram
[18:30] because he was the first
[18:33] born and
[18:35] um let's see what we going
[18:39] next until the uh Tabernacle and
[18:43] Temple the firstborn had the right of
[18:46] conducting the service of
[18:49] god let's go to
[18:51] numbers
[18:57] 8
[19:12] verse
[19:14] 14
[19:24] 16 so until uh you know when the
[19:28] children of Israel were uh in were drawn
[19:31] out of or C out of Egypt then God took
[19:33] the first born that night before they
[19:35] left by um the firstborn of the
[19:37] non-israelites that unless you had that
[19:40] blood over the L of your door the first
[19:41] born was going to die cuz he's going to
[19:44] take the first born then they took the
[19:46] uh the
[19:48] Levites uh instead of taking the
[19:50] firstborn of all Israel he took the Le
[19:52] the first he took the Levites as the
[19:54] first born so verse 14 Thou shalt th sht
[19:57] thou separate the Levites from among the
[19:59] children of Israel and the Levites shall
[20:01] be mine and after that shall the Levites
[20:03] go in to do the service of the
[20:05] Tabernacle of the congregation and thou
[20:06] shall cleanse them and offer them for an
[20:10] offering let's see so just to review
[20:13] that the birth right is um a double
[20:16] portion it's a a symbol of the power and
[20:19] dignity it's both spiritual and temporal
[20:22] because there's a a natural lineage of
[20:25] the birth right that goes through Judah
[20:26] and and many to Joseph and ephra and uh
[20:31] there's also a spiritual birth right
[20:32] that we get by being part of Christ part
[20:35] of his
[20:37] seed he is the
[20:39] seed um and the birthright comes with
[20:42] the privilege of being uh uh the
[20:45] communicator of the divine secrets and
[20:47] this is where you know in this Modern
[20:49] Age that if you say that God talks to
[20:52] you then you're just branded as a uh
[20:56] uh uh just a lunatic um the foolishness
[21:01] of the world you know was wisdom to God
[21:03] um but that's that was part of the mark
[21:05] of of having the birthright that God
[21:07] spoke to Abraham and revealed to him his
[21:09] word and the same thing with Isaac and
[21:11] Jacob and Joseph and uh it's a link in
[21:16] the line of descent through which the
[21:18] Messiah would be born and it represents
[21:20] Kings many nations and the priesthood
[21:22] and we'll see as we get down through
[21:24] here that um uh when the reabo J were
[21:28] separated Levi stayed with uh they went
[21:31] with jeroboam and then later on part of
[21:34] the Levites came back to rabo because
[21:36] jeroboam set up an altar in in Dan and
[21:39] Beth and uh wouldn't let them come back
[21:41] to Jerusalem to worship so the Levites
[21:43] later on they went back to riol um so
[21:46] this was this ended up being Judah uh
[21:49] the tribe of Judah Benjamin and some of
[21:53] the Levites so that's why uh down
[21:56] through history that uh the Jews are
[21:58] called These are these are called Jews
[22:01] these are called
[22:03] Israelites uh but we'll get into that
[22:06] more in detail as we go along so let's
[22:09] start looking at the Kings the uh the
[22:12] Royal Line lineage let's look at Genesis
[22:26] 49
[22:32] verse
[22:42] 10 so we already read how Jacob got all
[22:45] his sons around and he gathered them
[22:47] together and said Ruben you're not going
[22:48] to get the birth right cuz you uh slept
[22:50] with your father's
[22:53] um why for
[22:55] concubine and verse 10 of chap 49 the
[22:59] septer shall not depart from Judah nor a
[23:02] lawgiver from between his feet until
[23:04] Shiloh come and unto him shall the
[23:07] Gathering of the people be now this is
[23:09] an important scripture because you know
[23:11] the Jews uh to this day they say Christ
[23:14] was not the Messiah but this scripture
[23:17] testifies this is one of the key
[23:19] scriptures in the Bible of who the
[23:21] Messiah is because it
[23:23] says uh the she scepter shall not depart
[23:26] from Judah so Judah is got the the
[23:29] scepter all down through the if you look
[23:31] at the genealogy of Judah is father to
[23:33] son father to son unbroken unlike uh jar
[23:37] b b's lineage that has eight different
[23:39] Generations they you know a father might
[23:41] have a son and then he gets killed and
[23:42] another generation another gen uh uh
[23:45] another group of people come in and take
[23:47] over the kingdom but that's different
[23:49] with Judah it's unbroken all the way
[23:51] down to uh
[23:54] Christ and then shallows come so there's
[23:58] no more there's nobody else on the
[24:01] throne because Christ takes over so
[24:03] that's that's a testimony that uh who's
[24:06] who's uh you can't say if you look at uh
[24:09] Jerusalem now and say who's sitting on
[24:11] the on the throne there's nobody there
[24:13] because uh Shiloh has come so this is a
[24:18] testimony that that the Messiah has
[24:20] definitely
[24:24] come does that make
[24:26] sense
[24:33] um let's see and then I'll just read
[24:36] this next one 1st Chronicles
[24:39] 51-2 um I already read that sons of
[24:44] Reuben the firstborn of J he gathered
[24:48] his no I didn't read that I'm sorry now
[24:52] the sons of Reuben the firstborn of
[24:53] Israel for he was the firstborn for as
[24:55] much as he defiled his father's bed his
[24:57] birth birth right was given un the sons
[24:58] of Joseph the son of Israel and the
[25:01] genealogy is not to be reckoned after
[25:03] the birthright for Judah prevailed above
[25:05] his Brethren and of him came the chief
[25:07] ruler but the birthright was Joseph's so
[25:10] the geneology ghost of Judah to the
[25:12] Messiah the birthright is
[25:18] Joseph's and
[25:24] um and this
[25:26] is I know brother Wes talked about in in
[25:29] when you get to Revelations the uh first
[25:32] chapter and he has made us Kings and
[25:34] Priests unto God and his father to him a
[25:35] glory and Dominion forever and ever he
[25:37] has made us Kings and Priests just like
[25:39] in the Old Testament he made natural
[25:41] Kings and Priests through Judah and even
[25:44] through Jobo and in in the book of the
[25:47] revelation of Jesus Christ brother R
[25:49] said he ha made us oh there are certain
[25:52] truths we need to emphasize this is one
[25:53] of them he hath made us salvation is his
[25:56] doing salvation is of the Lord all of
[25:58] Grace he redeemed us for a purpose he
[26:01] brought us for a purpose we are Kings
[26:03] spiritual Kings or we are going to be
[26:05] Kings upon the Earth with him when he
[26:07] sits on his throne but now we are
[26:09] spiritual Kings and we Reign Over a
[26:11] spiritual
[26:12] Kingdom it says in Romans 5:17 for by
[26:16] one man's offense death reain by one
[26:19] much more they which receive abundance
[26:21] of Grace and of the gift of
[26:23] righteousness shall reign in life by one
[26:25] Jesus Christ and in Colossians
[26:28] 13 who ha delivered us from the power of
[26:31] darkness and has translated us into the
[26:32] kingdom reign of his dear
[26:34] son right now we reign with Christ
[26:37] having dominion over sin the World the
[26:38] Flesh and the devil showing forth his
[26:40] praise and glory showing forth himself
[26:43] for it is Christ in US willing and doing
[26:45] of his good pleasure yes indeed even now
[26:48] we are seated in Heavenly places in
[26:50] Christ Jesus to the promises that were
[26:53] that were made at the the very beginning
[26:55] to Abraham to have many nations and to
[26:57] have Kings come out of him are made uh
[27:00] are just opened up in the seals and
[27:04] uh because we're part of part of this
[27:07] plan part of that
[27:09] Birthright and God being misunderstood
[27:11] he said does not Paul say that he dares
[27:14] any of us to take a matter to the court
[27:15] to the unjust magistrate when know you
[27:18] not that the Saints shall judge the
[27:19] Earth we will sit with Christ and judge
[27:21] Kings and Priests and judge these people
[27:23] that we preach to and told them about
[27:25] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they
[27:27] refused ref to receive it think of
[27:30] it and then uh
[27:33] priests CU being a priest of your a lead
[27:37] a spiritual leader of of the family was
[27:40] a part of the birth right so now we're
[27:42] going to talk about the history of the
[27:44] levitical priesthood and how it started
[27:46] from the first born and we have just a
[27:49] few more minutes so I'll kind of get
[27:50] started with
[27:52] that uh in Revelations 26 it says
[27:55] blessed and holy is he that hath par in
[27:57] the first resurrection on such the
[27:59] second death hath no power but they
[28:00] shall be Priests of God and of Christ
[28:03] and shall reign with him a thousand
[28:04] years so as preach in this in this new
[28:07] kingdom that the son of David came to
[28:11] manifest we
[28:13] uh in the in the temple the priests
[28:15] would um the altar the of incense
[28:17] represented prayer we alter up by praise
[28:19] and thanksgiving and brother Brown
[28:21] talked about that we can now uh the veil
[28:25] has been rented so we can go behind the
[28:27] veil for tape and
[28:31] um actually this this is probably a good
[28:34] place to stop before we get into that so
[28:36] let's go ahead and stop
[28:43] in
