[0:26] us second Peter 1 let's go ahead and
[0:29] read this
[0:31] up
[0:34] here all right everybody ready yeah
[0:38] can't read it while you're thr somebody
[0:40] else Simon Peter and a servant and
[0:42] Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that
[0:44] have
[0:45] obtained like Precious face so he's not
[0:48] talking to the world he's talking to me
[0:49] and you all right he's talking to the
[0:52] ones that are born again so this has
[0:54] nothing to do with the outside world
[0:56] this is kind of like marriage and
[0:57] divorce it has nothing to do with the
[0:59] outside world CU we're going to read
[1:01] here in a few minutes what brother
[1:02] brandham said
[1:03] that um you can have a portion of these
[1:07] virtues and not even be born again can
[1:09] everybody see that from this side Jo you
[1:12] see it okay I Dan a that better GL see
[1:19] you got it yeah I got it okay all right
[1:22] like Precious Faith with us through the
[1:24] righteousness of God and our Savior
[1:26] Jesus Christ Grace and peace he
[1:28] multiplied unto you the to the knowledge
[1:30] of God and Jesus our lord according as
[1:33] his divine
[1:34] power ha given unto us all things that
[1:37] pertain under life and godliness so this
[1:39] is what he's talking about
[1:41] life and godliness all
[1:45] right through the knowledge of him that
[1:47] has called us remember we don't call
[1:50] oursel he calls us to what glory and
[1:54] virtue whereby are given so they're
[1:56] gifts these are gifts that God wants to
[1:58] give you but he doesn't automatically
[2:00] give them to you
[2:04] right and it's not that you have to earn
[2:06] them you have them with you when you get
[2:08] the new
[2:09] birth but you have to do what we talking
[2:11] about Wednesday night you got to
[2:12] exercise them you got to you got to use
[2:15] them all right and we'll read in just a
[2:16] few minutes what brother R said about
[2:19] that you got to make yourself available
[2:22] for God to work those virtues out
[2:25] through your life all right and and
[2:27] remember one thing if you're born again
[2:29] you're born again if you're born again
[2:30] at Faith you're just as Eternal as God
[2:34] is but God does see that's God requires
[2:38] that you go
[2:39] further he requires that these babies
[2:42] grow up he doesn't require that they
[2:44] stay babies he requires that they grow
[2:45] up right they don't want them to stay
[2:48] baby sure we want the little cute things
[2:49] to stay babies and do little cute things
[2:51] but you know
[2:53] what that's not normal so we want to you
[2:57] know we want to be normal Christians
[3:04] as it pertains to life and godliness all
[3:07] right whereby are given unto us
[3:12] exceeding in other words
[3:14] all great and precious promises that by
[3:17] these you might be
[3:19] partakers of the divine nature having
[3:22] escaped the corruption that is in the
[3:23] world through lust that's your new birth
[3:26] that's the thing that's changed you from
[3:29] what what you were to what you are now
[3:31] it's like I was stay Wednesday night you
[3:32] can hate me or you can love me if you
[3:35] don't go to church more now than you did
[3:37] 6 months ago your backslid or lost one
[3:39] of the two that's what the Bible said
[3:42] not me what the Bible say so you can
[3:44] pretty much check your own self
[3:46] up brother said you know where you're at
[3:49] with God at any moment well you know
[3:51] what if you miss church about three or
[3:53] four times a month you'll know that
[3:55] you're either lost or back live one all
[3:57] right and that's not my word that's his
[4:00] I didn't bring that today but I'll sure
[4:01] bring it and read it to you and besides
[4:04] this see besides the new
[4:06] birth see besides this besides the new
[4:09] birth see besides this what besides
[4:13] receiving the divine nature of God to
[4:15] change you into a Son of God to make you
[4:18] a Son of God and daughter of God and
[4:21] besides this giving all diligence see
[4:24] that's what I mean about being
[4:26] diligent there's two
[4:28] deds Dory and diligent and they're
[4:32] totally
[4:33] opposite I I think in Lea we become
[4:36] dilatory not diligent cuz diligent would
[4:40] make you see things in a different way
[4:42] all right and besides this giving all
[4:45] diligence add to what you believe right
[4:50] add to your faith cuz it's the only what
[4:53] it's what you believe all right add to
[4:57] your faith virtue
[5:00] add to your faith knowledge I'm not
[5:03] adding to the
[5:04] word right cuz it's adding to the new
[5:07] it's not you get all the new birth that
[5:09] you need but then there's little things
[5:11] that like brother R said remember he
[5:12] preached before this he preached the key
[5:15] key was Faith the door was Jesus uh read
[5:19] the book sometime or listen to the tape
[5:21] doors IND
[5:22] doors cuz you walk in the front door of
[5:25] the house meaning you're born again you
[5:28] walk into the front door of the house
[5:29] open the door and you walk in but now
[5:32] there's certain rooms in there you know
[5:35] we have four bedrooms three and a half
[5:36] bathrooms and and those of you that's
[5:38] been there we got several doors but you
[5:41] know having several doors we can uh we
[5:45] started early for your sake so I could
[5:47] talk about
[5:50] you hey brother K how you doing brother
[5:53] good to see you Lord bless your
[5:56] heart and uh you can find my thought
[5:58] that I was just saying uh doors thank
[6:00] you I knew that somebody pick it up
[6:03] somebody's paying attention besides me
[6:05] house you walk in a house you got doors
[6:08] now brother Brown PRS doors and doors
[6:10] God walks up to one door and you
[6:12] say no you can't come in that door why
[6:16] there's something behind it you don't
[6:17] want him to see right and remember the
[6:20] door knobs are on the inside they're not
[6:22] on the outside he's not going remember
[6:25] brother B said one time and it really
[6:26] struck me he said the whole Holy Ghost
[6:29] is a
[6:31] gentleman he's not overbearing he's not
[6:33] overpowering sure he empowers you and
[6:35] gives you power but he's a
[6:38] gentleman you do something wrong brother
[6:40] said the Holy Ghost to go out on the
[6:41] limb now that doesn't mean he goes out
[6:42] of you and goes over here you what he
[6:44] does is is he's going hey till you
[6:47] behave I'm going to go right out here
[6:49] for a minute and when you get all your
[6:51] stuff worked out I'm going to come back
[6:53] that don't mean you lose your Holy Ghost
[6:55] and you everybody understand that you
[6:56] don't lose you can't lose the Holy Ghost
[6:58] if you're born again again but you can
[7:01] grieve it the Bible says grieve not the
[7:04] holy spirit of God where by your SE so
[7:06] you can grieve it
[7:08] away brother R said you have to ask him
[7:10] to come
[7:12] back same thing with the door he's not
[7:14] just going to come you know going
[7:16] through the door just open the door and
[7:17] come no he's going to go you mind if I
[7:20] come in
[7:22] yeah you mind if I come see
[7:25] you okay that's exactly what these
[7:28] virtues are
[7:29] they're doors
[7:31] indoors because look that says right
[7:33] there Tabernacle well inside Tabernacle
[7:36] you got doors or you got skins Badger
[7:39] skins you know they had skins before
[7:41] they had doors so it was Badger skin had
[7:43] it covered up now we're supposed to be
[7:46] where everything is uncovered all right
[7:48] so it's besides this giving all
[7:51] diligence add to your faith it's an
[7:53] individual Walk With
[7:55] God all right it's not it's not we're
[7:57] not we're sure we're going to take a
[7:59] wrap in a
[8:01] group but there are levels of
[8:05] understanding that you can come to or
[8:07] you can't come to one of the two all
[8:12] right besides this giving all diligence
[8:15] add to your faith virtue and to Virtue
[8:17] knowledge and to knowledge Temperance
[8:19] Temperance patience patience godliness
[8:21] godliness brotherly kindness and
[8:23] brotherly kindness charity all right for
[8:25] if these things
[8:27] be in you yes in you I in yeah we're in
[8:33] second Peter 1 in
[8:35] you all
[8:37] right and I know y'all and nobody came
[8:39] late but let's try to start about 5 or
[8:41] 10 minutes before because if you don't
[8:42] we just sit in here and Y and talk about
[8:44] the world and get all that on our mind
[8:46] and brother Dale wants them to be um in
[8:49] their Sunday school class and nobody out
[8:50] so let's just kind of keep it quiet a
[8:52] little bit if you don't mind and uh you
[8:55] can talk about grocery shopping and who
[8:57] you saw on the internet outside or
[8:59] something somewhere but let's just kind
[9:00] of keep it to where uh to where we start
[9:03] thinking about God a little bit sooner
[9:05] cuz it's not humanly we're not like a
[9:08] light switch I'm not so I know you're
[9:11] not I have to start that's why the Bible
[9:13] says meditate on me meditate in other
[9:16] words just kind of get up in the morning
[9:17] like I did with this I didn't really sit
[9:19] down and go well I'm going to use quote
[9:21] this and this but I had a line that I
[9:22] that I'm trying to go down same way with
[9:24] Dad dad's got a line he's trying to go
[9:26] down right and then the Lord may move
[9:28] that line up over all right but still
[9:31] it's a meditation of even just driving
[9:33] from home to here 8 minutes you can get
[9:35] a sermon or something that you need to
[9:38] say to the people and I believe it's
[9:41] what God working on both ends if
[9:43] somebody had a question God will give an
[9:44] answer right cuz we go different ways
[9:46] and we go why we do
[9:49] that but we know it's what God knows we
[9:51] don't for if these things be in you
[9:54] verse eight in you not on
[9:56] you see it can be on you that's like
[9:59] sister breita was asking last night she
[10:02] said brother R said there's a difference
[10:03] in the baptism of Holy Ghost and the new
[10:04] birth that's exactly
[10:09] correct you can have the baptism of the
[10:11] Holy Ghost every day of your life on
[10:12] your spirit and die and go to hell Joel
[10:15] said I'll pour out my spirit upon All
[10:17] Flesh so there's an anointing all over
[10:19] this
[10:20] world you say of the Holy Spirit
[10:22] absolutely which what brother Brown he
[10:24] preached anointed ones at the end time
[10:26] when he preached anointed ones at the
[10:27] end time he said they're Anointed with
[10:28] the truth true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[10:30] but they're false
[10:32] inside right that's what we're
[10:34] contending with right now that's not a
[10:37] future event we're contending with that
[10:39] right now all right cuz you can be
[10:44] Sanctified anointed Sanctified of
[10:49] God and die and go to heaven Judas
[10:53] did Judas did right I know I see some
[10:57] eyeballs popping out but that's exactly
[10:58] the TR that's right you can have the
[11:00] Holy Ghost that's a direct quote from
[11:02] Brother R you can have the Holy Ghost on
[11:04] your spirit you hear what I said on your
[11:05] spirit every day of your life be
[11:08] religious come to this church sit here
[11:10] think everything's all right but you
[11:12] turn the word down one
[11:15] time your B child I when I think of that
[11:19] I always remember the experience you
[11:23] absolutely why' God put brother Brown
[11:25] through those experiences so they would
[11:26] be forever imprinted in our mind that
[11:29] when we come to a point to where
[11:30] somebody's everybody understand what
[11:32] she's talking about all right the Misha
[11:34] experience where brother BR went he met
[11:36] these Pentecostals and that one would
[11:38] stand up and prophesy and the other one
[11:40] would speak in tongues and one would
[11:41] interpret and God met and brother BR met
[11:44] the one this when he was just a young
[11:46] boy but he still had that gift so he
[11:49] went over and contacted this man genuine
[11:51] Christian he went over and make contact
[11:53] with the one that was doing the
[11:54] interpreting what living with another
[11:57] woman had two children by her and was
[11:59] married living in adultery and doing
[12:02] what he was doing all right so and
[12:04] remember that stuned brother brandom a
[12:06] little bit until he went up to the cave
[12:08] remember God come through with the wind
[12:10] and blew it to Hebrews what is it 6 or 7
[12:13] it says the rain falls on the just and
[12:15] the unjust all right so that's what Joel
[12:17] said Joel said I pour out my spirit on
[12:18] All Flesh so All Flesh has an
[12:21] anointing even the Sinners even a sinner
[12:24] has an anointing how do you think they
[12:26] um well you are a sinner if you're if
[12:28] you're not born again
[12:30] the they don't even they're not even
[12:32] counted in that see you got your you got
[12:35] your people that are total unbelievers
[12:37] that do not that'll
[12:39] never that'll never that's never had his
[12:41] name put on a book except the book of
[12:43] Sinners remember we went through the
[12:45] book of life and the books there's books
[12:48] inside of books judas's name was put on
[12:50] the book as a
[12:52] Believer then it was erased out because
[12:55] of what he he didn't go on with God he
[12:57] stopped right
[12:59] same way with you and I that's what I
[13:02] say about coming to church and doing
[13:03] things doing Christian things you don't
[13:04] have to you don't have to uh live here
[13:08] but I I promise you one thing this is
[13:09] where I get my
[13:10] fuel right here I get my fuel right here
[13:13] I I'm not going to go to a a candy store
[13:17] and get gasoline I need gasoline from my
[13:20] car so I stop at a place that's got
[13:22] gasoline all right so these things are
[13:26] are required
[13:29] they're
[13:31] required like I
[13:35] said goats are hardheaded I've got three
[13:38] of them I watch them every
[13:40] day they would absolutely kill theirself
[13:44] to get through that wire to get to
[13:46] something else that they've already got
[13:47] in their
[13:49] pin because it's over there but now
[13:52] remember a sheep has to be
[13:55] led all right and that's what we want to
[13:57] be we want to be sheep but now brother
[13:59] br will say in a minute I think I got
[14:00] that quote where brother BR said sheep
[14:02] manufacturers wool they don't have to
[14:04] stand there and go produce wool produce
[14:06] wool no they just
[14:08] eat they
[14:10] eat and then what they eat produces what
[14:13] they are all right same way with you and
[14:16] I the gospel to miss now is just more
[14:19] simple than it ever has been even having
[14:22] Revelation more than I had you know
[14:24] several years ago it just become more
[14:26] simple that truly the Bible says that
[14:29] the godhead can be explained by the
[14:31] things that we see and here that we see
[14:33] that and I had read this many times in
[14:36] verse three where it says that all
[14:39] things pertain unto life what that's not
[14:43] just you're
[14:44] alive it's your
[14:46] life the life you live and godliness
[14:50] what here you got to put those two
[14:52] together like I say Wednesday night
[14:54] brother R said the book is sealed on the
[14:56] front and the
[14:57] back but it better be the same seal on
[15:00] the front as it is on the back people
[15:02] see you coming forward or walking away
[15:03] from you they ought to see the same
[15:05] thing in other words you ought to bring
[15:06] what you do at work to hear and not be
[15:08] ashamed of any of
[15:11] it any of
[15:14] it if you
[15:17] are it's a problem with a seal somewhere
[15:21] okay all right that's what I mean we we
[15:24] got to have a checkup here everybody's
[15:25] got to we got to everybody we all got to
[15:27] have a checkup
[15:30] if these things be in you verse eight
[15:34] and abound not just be in you but they
[15:38] abound what does abound mean
[15:40] abundance overflowing right you get a
[15:44] bountiful crop then you got so much with
[15:46] it you don't know what to do with it so
[15:49] you give it to everybody else well
[15:50] that's what these virtues
[15:51] are Peter said Silver and Gold Have I
[15:54] None Like I said he had no money he had
[15:57] no way to get the person healed but what
[15:59] he had inside of him such as I do have
[16:03] Peter says I give I unto thee rise up
[16:05] and
[16:06] walk so he had the amount of money in
[16:09] the checkbook to write the check with
[16:12] our problem is we sometimes we write
[16:14] checks they ain't no money in the bank
[16:16] and what does it do brother Brown said
[16:18] it bounces right so now and that's us
[16:22] cuz God's checkbook never bounces all
[16:24] right cuz when you start with this
[16:26] divine nature of God God does give you
[16:29] a
[16:30] check Prophet City he gives you a check
[16:32] with his name on it cuz you know what he
[16:35] doesn't really trust
[16:38] you or is it that you can't trust
[16:42] yourself cuz he knows the in from the
[16:44] beginning he knows what you're going to
[16:45] do with it when he gives it to you why
[16:47] said and this will hit you one day just
[16:49] like a brick like it did me God's knows
[16:51] are the best yeses you've ever heard cuz
[16:54] if he says no if you say God I want to
[16:55] go down this line he says no what
[16:57] happens is he knows what's going to
[16:59] happen to you if he says yes and it will
[17:01] be a disaster so if he keeps saying no
[17:05] maybe he's wanting you to turn and go
[17:06] this way and here's where his yeses are
[17:09] okay cuz he knows and we don't so it's
[17:11] not this is not for his edification
[17:13] there's nothing in the Bible to edify
[17:17] God he don't need it or he's not
[17:21] God it's for mine and your edification
[17:24] it's for God not to believe in you it's
[17:26] for you to believe in yourself
[17:29] okay you to believe that God's with you
[17:32] and that God's going to and we know what
[17:34] God doing it but it's a both of you are
[17:38] in
[17:38] there you have a
[17:41] choice you have a
[17:44] choice that's what he showed Abraham
[17:46] when he was going to kill
[17:47] Isaac he wanted Abraham to see how much
[17:50] Faith he had in absolutely absolutely
[17:55] and that's exactly the truth because I
[17:57] believe Abraham was going to get kill
[17:59] him I believe he was going to kill him
[18:01] and I believe God knew he was going to
[18:02] kill him or he had put that he would
[18:03] have put that angel there to stop his
[18:06] hand well that angel stopped his hand
[18:08] and I'm I'm pretty sure that hand may
[18:10] have been coming down and he grabbed
[18:12] that thing and said no wait a minute
[18:14] Abraham now I know now God don't say now
[18:16] I know how can somebody all knowing say
[18:18] now I know he's saying Abraham now you
[18:21] should know that I'm with you and
[18:25] whatever I say I'm going to do for you
[18:27] you're going to believe it you know
[18:29] that's why he was a father by faith he
[18:30] just believed Abraham just believed had
[18:32] problems in his life and all but still
[18:34] he he believed for if these things be in
[18:37] you and
[18:38] abound they make
[18:40] you they will make you act this
[18:43] way all right that's what the Bible says
[18:45] they'll make you act like this stature
[18:48] of a perfect man all right that you
[18:52] shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful
[18:54] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[18:56] Christ but he that lath these things is
[18:59] blind not
[19:01] physically but spiritually all right
[19:04] you're spiritually blind and cannot see
[19:06] a far off what's a far off
[19:08] Revelation how can you get Revelation if
[19:11] you cut God off you can't God's always
[19:16] moving if we stop then we backlip all
[19:19] right and have
[19:22] forgotten that he was purged from his
[19:25] old sin sometimes we
[19:27] forget sometimes we forget where we came
[19:30] from and God got to remind us wherefore
[19:33] the rather
[19:35] Brethren I don't want

[20:36] verse 11 for so an entrance or a door
[20:41] shall be
[20:42] ministered unto you
[20:46] abundantly fivefolds of
[20:49] it you can't you cannot get these
[20:53] virtues and have them working in your
[20:55] life by
[20:56] yourself Peter did didn't he had Jesus
[20:59] Christ almighty God for three and 1/2
[21:01] years teach him these virtues and when
[21:03] he got the holy ghost boom they became
[21:07] they became Holy Ghost virtue cuz Peter
[21:09] didn't have a lot of patience when Jesus
[21:11] was
[21:11] around he likeed to cut people there off
[21:14] and go to fighting and
[21:17] yeah but now here he's
[21:23] not why he was on this side of born
[21:25] again and this side of born again okay
[21:28] but being born
[21:30] again and what does Peter say Being Born
[21:32] Again by The Incorruptible word
[21:34] Incorruptible word of God so we know
[21:35] what Peter said an entrance shall be
[21:37] ministered unto you abundantly into the
[21:40] Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and
[21:42] Savior Jesus Christ so how you going to
[21:43] get these
[21:46] verses not by yourself not sitting at
[21:48] home not reading G's Almanac or or um
[21:52] Charles Stanley
[21:54] or Joel
[21:56] Olstein I mean my God people how can you
[21:58] talk to a
[22:00] man Joel things says I don't preach on
[22:03] sin that's why he's got 15,000 people in
[22:06] his church if you start preaching the
[22:07] sin he'd have about
[22:12] 15 sin's our problem I believe I got it
[22:15] in here brother BR said sin means miss
[22:17] the
[22:19] mark sin's not smoking drinking cussing
[22:22] running around with women and all that
[22:23] stuff it's unbelief it's not believing
[22:25] in what God Said So now let's read this
[22:28] brother Brown goes to Hebrews 10 and 5
[22:31] now we're going to talk about the
[22:32] Tabernacle now Tabernacle is of course a
[22:34] place where we go to rest now get
[22:37] freshness and so forth like resting from
[22:38] sleep or so forth now Hebrews 10 in the
[22:41] 5ifth verse Paul brings it in wherefore
[22:43] when he cometh into the world he sayth
[22:45] sacrifice that's Christ sacrifice and
[22:47] offering thou wouldest not but a body
[22:49] hast thou prepared me what is a
[22:52] tabernacle now a body God
[22:55] tabernacling in a body
[22:58] that do you really believe
[23:02] that is you better or you stop right
[23:07] there God once up high when he came down
[23:09] on the mountain even a bulock or cow
[23:11] touch the mountain he must be killed God
[23:13] is Holy last evening when those angels
[23:15] covered their face holy serap with holy
[23:17] faces don't even know what sin means and
[23:19] they have to cover their face all right
[23:21] got
[23:23] it in the presence of God cover their
[23:26] feet in humility now holy God could
[23:27] could not condone sin so nothing could
[23:30] touch the mountain now you know what
[23:31] he's talking about where
[23:32] Moses told him to bring he said bring
[23:35] the children of Israel back to this
[23:36] mountain and I'll speak to them all
[23:38] right then God was made flesh and dwelt
[23:40] Among Us in the form of Jesus Christ his
[23:42] son his creation then that son gave his
[23:45] life and the blood cell of God was
[23:46] broken that the life might come out of
[23:49] the blood to us so he's transferred
[23:51] whatever he is to
[23:53] us cuz that statute of a perfect man
[23:56] that is that's Jesus portrayed that when
[23:58] he walked on
[23:59] earth
[24:01] right through that blood we are cleansed
[24:04] and now our blood our life which came by
[24:06] living through sexual desire brought our
[24:07] life in the world the blood of Jesus
[24:09] Christ cleanses us changes our Nature by
[24:13] sending upon us the Holy Spirit then we
[24:15] become into the divine nature of God
[24:19] then we become a dwelling place for God
[24:22] Jesus said at that day you'll know that
[24:23] I am in the father and father in me I in
[24:25] you and you in me so you see who in you
[24:29] the very
[24:31] Creator know how that God is in his
[24:33] church the church is now supposed to
[24:35] take the place of Christ carrying on his
[24:38] ministry he that believeth on me the
[24:40] works that I do shall he do also yet a
[24:41] little while in the world seeth me no
[24:43] more yet you shall see me now where are
[24:45] we going to see him
[24:48] at where we going to see him at each
[24:52] other okay in each
[24:55] other see the world that's why I said
[24:57] it's going going to be a secret I was
[24:58] telling the the brothers they were
[25:00] talking about the coming of the Lord and
[25:01] and you know when the Rapture and all
[25:03] these
[25:04] things when we get out of here it's all
[25:07] going to be a secret nobody's going to
[25:09] know about it nobody all right it's a
[25:12] secret catching away because where is
[25:16] Christ Christ is only in the
[25:19] bride indwelling you got me IND dwelling
[25:23] in here that's why it says in the Bible
[25:25] in if these things be in you you in a
[25:28] bound not on you Butz you have an
[25:30] anointing like I said you be anointed
[25:32] for a lot of things there's a lot of
[25:33] anointed preachers around but they're
[25:35] false CU of what they speak all
[25:39] right where was I there it
[25:43] is even in you to the end of the world
[25:45] see there it is carrying on his
[25:48] work but look you notice here he said
[25:53] first got to have what
[25:56] faith
[26:00] and a brother came up to
[26:02] me might have been
[26:06] Sunday and he was real honest and he
[26:09] said I don't have faith for
[26:13] everything and I can hey that's the
[26:15] first place to
[26:16] get that's the first place to get is
[26:18] just say I just don't have faith for
[26:20] that right there well okay then let's
[26:22] work on that right there all right and
[26:25] we all obviously work
[26:28] here we're still here so there's
[26:30] something we don't some of us don't have
[26:32] faith in that's why you need a five-fold
[26:34] Ministry to tell you five different
[26:37] angles of the same story not not five
[26:40] different stories of five different
[26:41] stories I mean five different stories of
[26:43] the same story no you you get five
[26:45] different angles like Matthew Mark Luke
[26:47] and John that's four angles that are
[26:50] totally perfect of the same happening
[26:53] all right so the same way you get with a
[26:54] five-fold Ministry but a five-fold
[26:56] Ministry how many times times his
[26:57] brother Dell preached on I don't know
[27:00] just marriage and divorce but that's a
[27:02] hard one but preached on a new birth and
[27:05] then a preacher come in and preach and
[27:06] just say one little word or one little
[27:08] phrase and you go oh that's what that
[27:11] means and brother Dale has been
[27:12] hammering it for 6 months you needed
[27:15] that because you know what that's why
[27:17] God give you a five-fold Ministry cuz he
[27:19] said he gave some Apostle some prophets
[27:22] that means he didn't give everybody
[27:24] prophets only certain amount of people
[27:25] can handle a prophet only certain amount
[27:27] of people can handle this certain amount
[27:29] of people can handle that right he gave
[27:31] some but all that some is the body of
[27:34] Christ and you can maybe understand
[27:36] something a little bit more from a
[27:37] teacher a lot of people like a teacher
[27:39] because he can slow down he can break
[27:41] the things down for you but some people
[27:43] like an evangelist cuz you have let's
[27:45] just be
[27:47] honest if evangelist really do something
[27:51] for you then you got problems in your
[27:54] life a lot of people are shaking their
[27:56] head and that's exactly the the truth
[27:59] because an evangelist will stir up the
[28:01] emotion in you which is good it's of God
[28:04] stir up the emotion in you and get you
[28:05] to looking at your life or looking at
[28:07] something here or looking at something
[28:08] there right and get you under
[28:12] conviction where a teacher will take
[28:16] somebody that doesn't have a lot of
[28:17] problems sure we all got problems but
[28:19] not as much as the other and I don't
[28:22] like to use the word weaker but brother
[28:24] Brown did call him weak Christian some
[28:27] Christians weak that's why they're at
[28:29] the bottom of the pyramid down at Faith
[28:31] as you go up higher you develop more you
[28:34] get more faith cuz you never lose that
[28:36] Foundation he'll tell you in a minute if
[28:37] we get to it he never never lose that
[28:40] Foundation of Faith you go right back to
[28:42] that Faith every time you need something
[28:44] cuz you you got to have faith that you
[28:46] got virtue you got to have faith that
[28:48] you got
[28:49] knowledge that's why it says add to your
[28:51] faith and that's why I read that add to
[28:53] your faith virtue and the Bible says The
[28:55] Virtue knowledge but I didn't add it in
[28:57] I'm reading between the lines between
[28:58] the lines says add to your faith cuz if
[29:01] you don't have faith for knowledge right
[29:03] there s stop
[29:04] right this is just like a just like
[29:07] Jacob's
[29:08] fladder climbing up climbing up to God
[29:11] and that's what we're doing we're
[29:12] climbing up to God but we notice and see
[29:15] that that having faith we have people
[29:18] that are weak Christians so you take
[29:20] somebody like an evangelist and and and
[29:23] I want to be real honest with
[29:24] you I know brother R said it sometimes I
[29:27] have a hard time believing that brother
[29:29] Ram said every time you go to the altar
[29:30] you get weaker is know what he said
[29:34] every time you go to that altar you get
[29:35] weaker and weaker and
[29:38] weaker he wants you to sit he wanted you
[29:41] to sit in your seat and believe it right
[29:44] that Centurion walked up to Jesus and
[29:46] and said sir I got a
[29:52] problem right I got a person sick in my
[29:56] home Jesus said well let's go he said no
[30:00] you just speak it now and whatever you
[30:02] say that's what will happen we see that
[30:05] he had faith in that never had to have
[30:07] the Bible says lay hands on the sick and
[30:09] they shall recover but the Bible also
[30:10] says speak to the
[30:12] mountain not lay hands on the mountain
[30:14] speak to the mountain but remember you
[30:15] got to have something to move the
[30:17] mountain in you
[30:19] first are you are your check's going to
[30:21] bound all right so we see that how we we
[30:24] do have faith for certain things certain
[30:26] preachers Don't Preach a certain thing
[30:28] but teachers because brother R said
[30:31] teachers positionally places you in the
[30:33] body well a lot of times teachers do
[30:35] preach conviction so much they're the
[30:38] ones that take the ones that are already
[30:41] established in the gospel and carries
[30:43] them
[30:44] further okay and that's just the gifts
[30:47] that you that you have to deal with I
[30:50] mean some people go to sleep on a
[30:53] teacher but they won't on a evangelist
[30:56] or a or a pastor
[30:58] cuz they just sometimes they just can't
[31:00] understand but if evangelist is
[31:04] here and you like
[31:06] them you'll come to church on Wednesday
[31:08] night when you don't tell them anymore L
[31:10] brother
[31:11] that
[31:16] hello but that's the
[31:18] truth why because you have a contact
[31:21] with that person and that's okay that's
[31:25] but what it is you have faith in what
[31:27] that person
[31:29] says right you have a connection so you
[31:31] got to have five folds of it you got to
[31:33] have Apostle Prophet Pastor teach you
[31:35] got have all that all right to help us
[31:38] get up the statute of a perfect man
[31:39] because an entrance has been made
[31:41] ministered to us but first we got to
[31:43] have faith if you don't have faith that
[31:45] you got to come to church every Sunday
[31:46] and
[31:47] listen that's why I said you're either
[31:49] backl or lost there's no in
[31:52] between back ler laws one two and I it's
[31:55] not me to judge
[32:01] but notice here he said first we have
[32:03] faith virtue knowledge temp patience God
[32:05] goodness or godliness and brother love
[32:06] all right brother kindness and then add
[32:08] love let me read this over again I
[32:10] wanted to read it with the way he reads
[32:11] it and besides this giving all diligence
[32:14] add to your faith virtue The Virtue
[32:16] knowledge knowledge Temperance
[32:17] Temperance patience patience godliness
[32:19] godl brotherly kindness brotherly
[32:20] kindness charity which is love if these
[32:22] things be in you and abound they make
[32:24] you that you shall neither be baren or
[32:25] unfruitful the all of our Lord Jesus
[32:27] Christ watch what he says next now Peter
[32:30] is outlining something here for us that
[32:34] how to what how to get
[32:38] it how to get there Peter is outlining
[32:41] something here for us that how to get
[32:43] there all right so that's why I said
[32:47] Wednesday night and I hope I didn't
[32:48] offend people but see that's this is old
[32:50] news because Peter had it Peter had it
[32:53] working in his life every
[32:56] day
[32:58] working in his Fish Department or
[32:59] whatever it is you know and and all he
[33:02] he had these virtues working in his life
[33:04] right and Peter there's no way Peter
[33:07] could tell us how to get there unless
[33:08] Peter had it right now I want to say
[33:12] this that there are some people who have
[33:14] a portion of this virtue and all this
[33:16] wisdom patience and so forth that don't
[33:17] even Pro profess to be Christians now we
[33:21] just were teaching Sunday school and
[33:22] that's true there's some people that
[33:24] have a portion of this that don't even
[33:25] pretend to be Christian but that doesn't
[33:28] that won't do it it's like a black bird
[33:31] trying to put peacock feathers in his
[33:33] wings to make him a peacock he only
[33:35] disgraces himself see that you only make
[33:39] a disgrace out of yourself when you
[33:40] don't do what God tells you to do and
[33:42] and it's so
[33:43] obvious um and I'm sorry that's just the
[33:46] way it is it's just obvious you
[33:49] you prove who you
[33:52] are be better just to stay the
[33:55] Blackbird when he tries to exercise
[33:57] these things without being a Christian
[33:59] he's just simply all out of place all
[34:02] right like a sycamore
[34:05] tree trying to manufacture apple
[34:09] apple it can't do it although it's a
[34:11] tree but it can't manufacture apples
[34:14] like a mu trying to manufacture wool
[34:15] trying to be a sheep when he's a mu see
[34:17] he can't manufacture wool he can't do it
[34:20] wool is a gift to a
[34:24] sheep these are gifts to the
[34:28] individual not to a m all
[34:33] right well I can eat like a sheep I can
[34:36] do this like a sheep and no matter what
[34:38] you can do you've got to be a sheep in
[34:40] order to have wool let me stop here a
[34:43] minute the Sheep doesn't manufacture
[34:45] wool he has wool because he is a sheep a
[34:48] lot of people trying to say well I'll
[34:50] try to get good see that's what I don't
[34:52] want us to do we say well I'll just try
[34:54] to get good you can't do that sheep
[34:57] doesn't it isn't asked isn't isn't
[35:01] expected to manufacture wo it Bears wo
[35:03] and it does it because the sheep and
[35:05] when you're a Christian you just bear
[35:07] the fruit of the spirit you don't
[35:08] manufacture it you don't try to make it
[35:10] up you try don't make yourself something
[35:13] you're not that's why the brother Dell
[35:15] always says I I wish to God I
[35:18] could make
[35:20] everybody
[35:23] unbelievers cuz we get a thing in our
[35:25] mind that we're a Believer cuz we've
[35:26] been in the is 37 years and we do this
[35:30] what's I got to do with it it's this
[35:32] right here it comes right down to your
[35:34] life amen and you're the only one that's
[35:38] with you
[35:39] 24/7 you and
[35:41] God so don't think you're fooling
[35:44] anybody you're sure not fooling God
[35:46] Don't Make yourself something that
[35:47] you're not you just become what you're
[35:50] supposed to be then it takes care of
[35:52] itself if you heard people say well I
[35:54] I've joined church I really ought to
[35:55] quit this line you're trying trying to
[35:57] manufacture something again you can't do
[35:59] it so there's no need of trying no more
[36:01] than a mule can make himself have wool
[36:03] he can't do it now that's what he's
[36:05] talking about manufacturing Christianity
[36:07] what's going to happen is this is
[36:09] manifesting time we'll be we'll go now
[36:11] we'll finish up later or next
[36:14] Sunday somewhere along the line God's
[36:18] going to test your Born Again experience
[36:21] not for his purpose but for
[36:24] yours and if you're not you you know
[36:27] what then that's good because you know
[36:28] what God's calling you at least he at
[36:30] least he's trying to get you to see
[36:32] something he's yeah if it bothers you
[36:35] then it's God trying to call you into
[36:37] the family
[36:42] it take it an honor that God's bothering
[36:45] you about your new birth because you
[36:47] know what if he's not then you're not a
[36:52] child you know I had a
[36:55] question that if these things
[36:58] are
[36:59] right it talks about the knowledge God
[37:08] right but these things be in you and
[37:11] abound those things to be in yes
[37:16] abounding in you not
[37:21] bouncing good thing bu but
[37:25] what you would be bountiful in the
[37:28] knowledge
[37:35] of oh yeah
[37:42] camera I'm leave
[37:50] it
