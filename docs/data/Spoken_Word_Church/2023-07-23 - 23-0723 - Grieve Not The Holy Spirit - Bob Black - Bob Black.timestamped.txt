[0:00] mm-hmm
[0:05] I'm getting an Amber Alert
[0:08] um
[0:09] it's asking me to subscribe all of a
[0:12] sudden
[0:15] hold on let me see if I can
[0:21] all right
[0:30] sorry about that y'all just bear with me
[0:54] okay
[0:56] let's go the Lord in prayer Lord God
[0:58] we're so grateful to be able to gather
[0:59] together this morning Lord around your
[1:01] word and as we study these things out I
[1:03] pray the Lord that you'll bless your
[1:04] people and
[1:05] Lord edify them build up their Faith
[1:08] Lord give us something in the hour that
[1:10] we're living in Lord to help us along
[1:11] life's way be with the services today I
[1:13] pray Lord that you're just blessed by
[1:15] the way to seize Minister and brother
[1:17] pageants blessed brother Louise this
[1:19] morning Lord and we just ask your
[1:20] blessing upon the service now in your
[1:22] name amen
[1:24] now we've been kind of studying on
[1:27] Hebrews chapter 11 and and getting into
[1:29] verse 12 but I I kind of wanted to take
[1:31] just a little detour I've been thinking
[1:33] about some of these things that I I'll
[1:35] bring out today I just wanted to
[1:36] meditate on you know it you the only way
[1:40] that you can please God is to have faith
[1:42] and and there's things that you do if
[1:44] you disbelieve God's word and and act
[1:46] out of turn and things like that and it
[1:48] Grieves the Holy Spirit now you know
[1:50] when we come together and we gather
[1:52] around we gather together in in this
[1:54] little assembly this morning you know
[1:56] really our main objective is to is to be
[1:58] pleasing to God and to do things so that
[2:00] we're we don't do things that are that
[2:02] are Grievous to the holy spirit because
[2:04] we want we want the service and we want
[2:06] the songs that are sung and the words
[2:08] that are said and everything our actions
[2:10] and our D's and the things that come
[2:11] across the pulpit to be pleasing to the
[2:13] Holy Spirit now Paul in Ephesians
[2:16] chapter 4 verse 30 will kind of study
[2:17] out a few scriptures there in Ephesians
[2:19] 4 30 Ephesians chapter 4 where he said
[2:22] in verse 30 and grieve not the Holy
[2:24] Spirit spirit of God whereby you are
[2:26] sealed into the day of redemption so we
[2:28] can take away from that there's a lot of
[2:30] things that you can do that that can
[2:31] grieve the holy spirit of God even after
[2:34] you're born again
[2:36] now if you study these things out before
[2:38] you're born again there's things that
[2:40] you can do to grieve the Holy Spirit and
[2:41] you know you uh he would and we'll we'll
[2:44] kind of study these things out and as we
[2:46] go through some of the slides
[2:48] but it's very Grievous when we don't
[2:50] when we don't believe what God is saying
[2:52] across the pulpit when we don't believe
[2:54] what uh what the message is and it when
[2:57] he said you can grieve the Holy Spirit
[2:59] until finally your soul just kind of
[3:01] backs off and you're not listening to
[3:03] that to that still Small Voice anymore
[3:04] until it becomes fainter and fainter and
[3:07] your your heart becomes as like in in
[3:09] the Old Testament says your heart begins
[3:11] sealed your conscience becomes seared
[3:13] over as a as this as if it was seared
[3:15] with a hot iron and you just don't hear
[3:17] anymore
[3:18] why because you've grieved away the Holy
[3:21] Spirit but now after the Holy Ghost
[3:23] after you've been born again you do
[3:24] things just in your conduct and the way
[3:26] that you act that Grieves the Holy
[3:28] Spirit you know things can go wrong
[3:29] that's why there's deacons said in the
[3:31] church and you know keep you know keep
[3:32] children from running up and down the
[3:34] aisles and so forth like that because
[3:35] you want to set the atmosphere so where
[3:37] the Holy Spirit has it it feels at
[3:39] Liberty to to do things to move and and
[3:42] to impact your life and now brother Ann
[3:46] would say in the Israel and the church
[3:47] he'd said seal till how long because
[3:49] this verse is saying don't grieve the
[3:51] Holy Spirit whereby you're sealed so
[3:53] you're sealed you've got the Holy Ghost
[3:55] right you've been born again you've been
[3:57] born again and now you can do things
[3:59] that are wrong he's but he's saying he's
[4:01] trying to stress the point seal till how
[4:03] long grieve not the holy spirit of God
[4:05] whereby you're sealed until the day of
[4:07] your Redemption not from one Revival to
[4:09] another but until the day of your
[4:12] Redemption
[4:13] the everlasting life just isn't a little
[4:15] space of time Everlasting is eternally
[4:18] forever can't die no more than a grain
[4:20] of corn could have become a cocklebur
[4:22] and if a man's born of the spirit of God
[4:25] it's automatically he lives the life
[4:28] y'all think about that now it's if
[4:30] you're born again it's going to be
[4:32] automatic that you live the life
[4:33] automatic now of course you're gonna you
[4:36] know just like a little baby growing up
[4:37] it's you're going to trip and fall and
[4:39] do things but as you grow up you're the
[4:41] little things that that maybe a little
[4:42] child will deal with as you grow up and
[4:44] become an adult you're not dealing with
[4:45] the same things anymore those things get
[4:48] worked out
[4:49] now but you so you're you're grieving do
[4:52] you think of Jesus looking at us like a
[4:54] little child growing up and and to
[4:57] grieve means to suffer you know any
[4:59] parent can look at their children and
[5:00] see things that were I wish they
[5:02] wouldn't do that a little child getting
[5:04] playing with their their tricycle and
[5:06] they get get to getting too close to
[5:08] traffic hold don't do that and you start
[5:10] yelling at them get out of get out of
[5:11] the road or as they grow up they start
[5:13] talking to the to getting in the wrong
[5:15] crowd and everything and it becomes
[5:17] Grievous and you see Jesus is kind of
[5:19] looking at he God is looking at that
[5:21] with the same same kind of viewpoint I
[5:24] guess you'd say he's like a parent
[5:26] and and we can do things that cause him
[5:28] to to grieve and greet to grieve means
[5:32] to suffer grief to feel grief for
[5:33] because of to cause great distress to
[5:36] someone and you know if you really break
[5:39] it down to grieve the holy spirit means
[5:40] to engage in behaviors or attitudes that
[5:43] are contrary to God's Will and character
[5:45] to to do things that are wrong or to
[5:49] think things that are on to behave wrong
[5:51] or to have the wrong attitude the wrong
[5:54] attitude when we come to church or when
[5:56] we're just going through life and we're
[5:57] doing things the wrong attitude and that
[5:59] Grieves the Holy Spirit
[6:02] brother and would say in the position of
[6:04] a believer in Christ he'd say
[6:06] quoted for the sake of time grieve not
[6:08] the holy spirit of God and he broke it
[6:10] down he'd say by your back biting back
[6:13] by talking about people behind their
[6:14] backs saying things that to kind of stir
[6:16] things up by your carrying on now if you
[6:19] really break down what carrying only is
[6:21] and that's that's kind of something
[6:23] harder to find what is carrying on with
[6:25] the internet says carrying on means they
[6:27] just act foolishly you know just just
[6:29] just uh behave in in a way that's like
[6:31] you know you know what it is when you
[6:33] say it carrying on indifference not not
[6:38] really caring about not I think that's
[6:40] one of the worst things to see in in
[6:42] Christian Christian uh Christian people
[6:45] is indifference where you just don't
[6:47] really care anymore you just you're
[6:49] you're not really engaged in the service
[6:51] anymore you're just kind of going
[6:52] through checking off your your Sunday
[6:54] services and you don't really oh to
[6:57] think about now that that would grieve
[6:59] the Holy Spirit just to see somebody not
[7:02] really caring anymore you know what the
[7:04] ministers are preaching about growing in
[7:06] maturity in a stature perfect man and
[7:07] the blessings of God and the promises of
[7:09] God and people just get indifferent well
[7:12] it's just the same old same old and
[7:14] another way you can grieve the holy
[7:16] spirit is by your unbelief
[7:18] to see the promises of God and all the
[7:20] acts all the things that you can have
[7:22] access to and hear Brother Adams make
[7:23] statements like we're living beliefs our
[7:25] Privileges and yet we fail to believe
[7:27] the things that that God has said grieve
[7:30] not the holy spirit of God whereby you
[7:32] are sealed to the day of your Redemption
[7:34] now now that's a powerful scripture
[7:36] because you're sealed to the day of your
[7:38] Redemption your soul is sealed you're
[7:40] born again but you can still do things
[7:43] that are Grievous to the Holy Spirit
[7:45] thank you
[7:48] and to see Jesus brother Brown said as
[7:50] you come lady he's talking to somebody
[7:52] in a prayer line come believing and and
[7:54] I I just want to talk about how the
[7:56] nature of the holy spirit because he's
[7:58] he's in this prayer line he's saying
[7:59] he's telling his sister come believe him
[8:01] don't have any doubts in your heart for
[8:03] if you are just a little suspicious
[8:06] now think about this if you're just a
[8:08] little suspicious the Holy Spirit cannot
[8:12] and will not if you're just a little
[8:14] suspicious it's it's a very timid being
[8:18] now you think about the nature of the
[8:20] holy spirit this morning is if we we
[8:22] want the Holy Spirit to feel welcome in
[8:24] this Sanctuary we'll want him to feel
[8:26] welcome in our lives but the Holy Spirit
[8:28] the nature of the holy spirit is very
[8:30] timid he's not going to just come kick
[8:33] the door down and just barge in and say
[8:36] well I'm taking over anyway you got to
[8:38] let him in you gotta you gotta you gotta
[8:40] you gotta have the right attitude and
[8:42] the right Behavior he's he's going to
[8:45] back off and pull away if if if you know
[8:47] you're not just treating the sanctuary
[8:49] right if if the conditions are not right
[8:52] if he detects any kind of unwelcome
[8:54] attitude then he's gonna pull back why
[8:56] because it's he's very timid the holy
[8:59] spirit is a person it's not just some
[9:00] kind of a spooky thing floating around
[9:02] or something it's a person it's the
[9:04] person so a person has characteristics
[9:06] and likes and does not dislikes and the
[9:08] Holy Spirit does not like unbelief
[9:11] it doesn't like all the things that we
[9:13] just read about foolishness and and
[9:15] carrying on and and all of those things
[9:19] and being led by the spirit brother
[9:21] Brown said but whatever I say now do
[9:23] just as I tell you for it isn't me
[9:25] when the anointing strikes me I don't
[9:27] even know until my brethren play a tape
[9:29] and tell me what I said so you see it's
[9:32] so timid the Holy Spirit
[9:34] just the least little thing Grieves it
[9:37] now think about that just the least
[9:39] little thing Grieves it be real reverent
[9:43] and Jesus will come to you if you're all
[9:46] excited he can't come to you see be
[9:49] reverent and believe
[9:52] now to think about that how you can be
[9:55] pleasing to the holy spirit is to be to
[9:57] think with a with a sane sound mind to
[10:00] think on the Lord to to be conscious of
[10:04] that you won't fellowship with God to be
[10:06] to meditate on his word to be reverent
[10:09] to be sincere you you'll know every
[10:12] every single time that brother Brown
[10:13] would move up all these three stages of
[10:16] grace to the next level the angel of God
[10:18] would come and tell him to be more
[10:20] sincere what I need to do be more
[10:21] sincere and be more sincere because the
[10:24] holy spirit is very timid and you're not
[10:27] going to get anywhere with the Holy
[10:28] Spirit if you're not sincere and
[10:30] reverent and and looking at things in
[10:32] the right with the right attitude and
[10:34] the right Behavior not not wanting to
[10:36] carry on or not do do something
[10:38] irreverent but
[10:40] because we don't want to grieve the holy
[10:42] spirit so when we come together around
[10:44] the word of God we want to have a church
[10:47] service that's pleasing to the Lord we
[10:49] want to have our lives in order so that
[10:51] we're pleasing to the Lord our every
[10:52] footstep every thought is pleasing to
[10:54] the Lord so that we don't grieve the
[10:56] Holy Spirit now
[10:58] if you want to find some examples of
[11:00] grieving the Lord you can go back to
[11:02] Ephesians 4 of course there's a lot of
[11:03] examples in Corinthians and all through
[11:06] the scriptures but where Paul says this
[11:08] in Ephesians 4 30 back up a few
[11:11] scriptures and he'll lay out some good
[11:13] examples that we can take take note of
[11:15] of how you can grieve the Holy Spirit
[11:18] and in verse 25
[11:22] wherefore putting away lying speak every
[11:24] man truth with his neighbor for we are
[11:27] members one of another
[11:28] now you know reading some of these
[11:30] scriptures getting down to the where the
[11:33] rubber meets the road but you know these
[11:36] are things that I think are worth kind
[11:38] of studying out and meditating on that
[11:40] that Christians are truth bearers now
[11:42] you think about this now we're talking
[11:43] about grieving the holy spirit that if
[11:45] you don't bear the truth if you say
[11:47] something that's that ain't quite right
[11:48] it's going to grieve the Holy Spirit
[11:50] Away the holy spirit is very timid so
[11:52] it's not going to like that Christians
[11:54] are called to be people of Integrity
[11:56] honesty and truthfulness now you go all
[12:00] the way back to the verse verse 1 in
[12:01] Ephesians chapter four and Paul says I
[12:04] therefore the prisoner of the Lord
[12:05] beseech you that you walk worthy of the
[12:07] vocation wherewith you are called in
[12:10] other words every aspect of your life
[12:11] should be trying to line up with what
[12:13] the Holy Spirit the way that he wants
[12:15] you to live to be truthful with one
[12:18] another be honest with one another try
[12:21] to try to you know if you promise
[12:22] somebody that you're going to do a
[12:23] certain deed for them on the job or
[12:25] something you you do the very best that
[12:27] you can of course in all aspects of your
[12:29] life but especially dealing with one
[12:31] with one another because we're brothers
[12:32] we're brothers and sisters in Christ
[12:35] and here's a good one and the Very
[12:38] skipping on down a couple of verses from
[12:40] 25 to 27 be angry and sin not let not
[12:44] the sun go down upon your Wrath
[12:46] now you know we're talking again about
[12:49] grieving the Holy Spirit
[12:52] anger anger at by just by itself isn't
[12:54] inherently sinful there's probably a lot
[12:56] of reasons that you could here's some
[12:58] good examples of when you can get angry
[13:00] and you might be right like you're you
[13:03] find out your kids hadn't done their
[13:04] maybe you're homeschooling your kids and
[13:06] you find out they hadn't done any
[13:07] lessons in like three or six months or
[13:10] something and of course you're going to
[13:11] naturally get a little bit upset what do
[13:13] you mean you haven't been recording your
[13:15] word or uh you know I I I'm gonna use
[13:18] Zach for an example he was telling us
[13:19] yesterday that he was on the job and the
[13:22] guy working the ship before him hadn't
[13:24] feel to get put gas in all the trucks so
[13:26] naturally you're going to be upset
[13:28] actually if you weren't a little upset
[13:30] something something will be wrong God
[13:32] don't want you to go through life like a
[13:34] robot and like not get upset when like
[13:37] you know you're you're your family's not
[13:40] living right you ain't you ain't doing
[13:42] right the people on the job ain't doing
[13:43] right so anger and you'll find we'll
[13:46] find a few examples in scripture here
[13:47] where where Jesus got angry the Bible
[13:50] says that he got angry so anger in
[13:53] itself is not inherently sinful but when
[13:55] you when it gets out of control you know
[13:58] when when things begin to get out of
[13:59] control see there's nothing wrong with
[14:01] you angry angry at your children for not
[14:03] doing what they're supposed to do if
[14:04] your kids don't don't uh don't show up
[14:07] on time for their job and then they get
[14:09] fired of course you're going to get
[14:10] angrier but when you cross that line and
[14:12] you start railing on them and saying
[14:14] you're stupid and worthless and
[14:16] something something else begins to take
[14:18] over that's that's so what's what's
[14:21] taking over what's in control
[14:23] you know uh you can kind of compare
[14:27] in Mark chapter 3 verse 1 to 5 when
[14:29] Jesus entered the synagogue and there
[14:31] was a man there which had a withered ham
[14:33] and he and he healed him and and they
[14:35] got all upset with him and he he said
[14:37] unto them is it lawful to do good on the
[14:39] Sabbath days or to do evil to save life
[14:40] or to kill but they held their peace and
[14:43] when he had looked around about on them
[14:44] with anger being grieved for the
[14:47] hardness of their hearts he saith unto
[14:49] the man's straight for stretched forth
[14:50] on hand now look at look at Jesus in
[14:52] this case he was angry at them because
[14:54] they did not believe that they got so
[14:57] wound up because he was trying to heal
[14:58] somebody on the Sabbath that they didn't
[15:00] even see the good that he was trying to
[15:02] do so naturally he got angry with him he
[15:05] was angry and furthermore he was grieved
[15:08] why was he grieved for the hardness of
[15:10] their hearts so there's another example
[15:12] of where you can grieve god with your
[15:15] hearts all Stony and you just don't you
[15:17] just you just don't care so much anymore
[15:19] oh that's what the gospel was given for
[15:22] to take somebody that don't care and and
[15:24] soften up that heart and start chain
[15:27] start when you begin to realize how much
[15:30] God loves you and how God wants to woo
[15:32] you and and do something with you and do
[15:34] something with your life
[15:35] it'll uh it it'll change that old Stony
[15:39] heart into and soften it up now talking
[15:42] about anger so who who really is the one
[15:44] in control on the left we got a picture
[15:46] of Jesus in the temple well striking out
[15:49] at all the animals and the people and
[15:50] everything because they were they turned
[15:52] his turn the temple into uh uh a den of
[15:55] Thieves that turned it into something
[15:57] where they were just interested in money
[15:58] but on the right you've some got some
[16:00] people that just have lost control
[16:02] lost control
[16:04] who's the one in control
[16:06] now just to kind of call out that that
[16:09] image on the on the left is if you've
[16:11] been paying attention to artificial
[16:13] intelligence lately I generated that
[16:15] from a computer that is a fake image can
[16:17] you believe that
[16:19] that's completely generated by
[16:21] artificial intelligence and this one too
[16:24] so don't let this anger out don't let
[16:26] the sun go down upon your wrath and this
[16:28] is where you start to grieve the holy
[16:29] spirit is when when you just get angry
[16:32] so angry that it starts taking up root
[16:35] in your life and you start getting
[16:36] bitter with one another and it starts
[16:38] growing up into something that's why the
[16:40] Bible says in that same verse Don't Let
[16:42] the Sun Go Down on your wrath don't
[16:45] allow it to fester and grow into a
[16:47] grudge or unresolved conflict if you got
[16:49] if you're angry at your spouse don't
[16:51] wait till tomorrow to get it resolved I
[16:54] I I've got uh over this is maybe too
[16:58] much information but over my wife and
[17:00] I's bed we have a sign that says don't
[17:03] forget to kiss me good night because we
[17:06] want to get all the problems resolved if
[17:08] there's any any fights or anything you
[17:11] get the problems resolved and every
[17:13] night before we go to bed we've got that
[17:15] sign over the bed that says don't forget
[17:16] to kiss me good night because
[17:19] uh it's because of this scripture don't
[17:22] allow things to fester and grow into a
[17:24] grudge don't carry unresolved conflict
[17:27] into the next day don't let anger linger
[17:29] in Poison relationships and handle your
[17:32] emotions in a manner that honors God and
[17:34] promotes healthy relationships with one
[17:36] with others why because if you don't if
[17:38] you're angry with somebody you got
[17:39] something against somebody if you don't
[17:40] deal with it right then then it might be
[17:43] 15 years later and you hadn't talked to
[17:45] that person in 15 20 years and you've
[17:47] you've oh you you just let you just let
[17:49] the devil tap dance all over your life
[17:53] you just let the devil run the show
[17:55] don't don't let things grow until they
[17:58] just get out of hand until until it
[18:00] becomes a problem greater than when it
[18:02] started
[18:03] be angry and sin not and of course of
[18:06] course we're all familiar with the
[18:07] scripture in John Chapter 2 or Jesus I
[18:10] was just referring to he went into the
[18:11] temple and and uh made a scourge of
[18:14] small cords and drove everybody out of
[18:16] the temple and in verse seven chords and
[18:18] drove everybody out of the temple and in
[18:20] verse 17 it says his disciples remember
[18:23] that it was written the Zeal of thine
[18:25] house hath eaten me up now brother Brown
[18:27] would often quote this scripture when
[18:29] he's talking about deacons in the church
[18:31] because sometimes you know deacons have
[18:33] to you you know there's a time when you
[18:35] you want to be nice and sweet to
[18:38] everybody but there's a time when you
[18:39] got to do like Jesus here and and as he
[18:42] rose drove everybody out you gotta you
[18:44] gotta get a little bit rough if if uh if
[18:48] things aren't going right you know you
[18:49] gotta
[18:51] straighten things out
[18:57] let's read through a few other places in
[18:59] the in the Bible where anger anger that
[19:02] you want to be sure that your anger is
[19:04] well placed in Proverbs Chapter 14 verse
[19:06] 17 it says he that is soon angry dealeth
[19:08] foolishly and a man of wicked devices is
[19:11] hated
[19:12] in Proverbs 15 18 a wrathful man stirth
[19:16] up strife
[19:17] but he that is slow to anger appeaseth
[19:20] strife and I'll I'll post these online
[19:22] I'm gonna I'm not going to belabor the
[19:24] point you can read all these scriptures
[19:25] in your own time and in verse 28 says he
[19:28] let him that stole still no more but
[19:31] rather let him labor working with his
[19:33] hands the thing which is good that he
[19:35] may have to give to him that needeth but
[19:37] what do these scriptures art for I'm
[19:39] reading about that there's things even
[19:41] after your new birth that you can do
[19:42] wrong that can grieve the Holy Spirit
[19:44] and God wants you to God wants you to
[19:46] not not be a thief but to to work for
[19:49] what you earn to to uh and verse 29 let
[19:52] no corrupt communication proceed out of
[19:54] your mouth but that was just good to the
[19:56] use of edifying that it may Minister
[19:59] Grace unto the hearers and I think
[20:01] there's there's a real that's something
[20:03] that'll really cause the Holy Spirit to
[20:05] draw back when you say a little joke
[20:07] that you don't need to be telling or say
[20:09] something a little bit crass you know
[20:11] sometimes we'll we'll get in that mode
[20:13] where we've
[20:14] well I'm just going to skip over there
[20:18] let no corrupt communication proceed out
[20:21] of your mouth
[20:22] engaging in Gossip or spreading
[20:24] malicious rumors using foul language
[20:26] profanity or derogatory terms
[20:29] promoting or discussing immoral
[20:31] behaviors that that sort of conversation
[20:33] has no business in a Christian's mouth
[20:35] discussing immoral things things that
[20:38] things that you're not supposed to
[20:39] things that the world that's the world
[20:41] what the world is doing encouraging
[20:43] harmful or destructive actions towards
[20:45] oneself or others engaging in sexually
[20:48] explicit or inappropriate discussions
[20:50] that violate God's design promoting
[20:53] violence all those things are corrupt
[20:55] communication and Paul's saying now so
[20:57] there's the scripture if anybody ever
[20:59] asks you where does the bible say we're
[21:00] not supposed to cuss you can take them
[21:02] to Ephesians 4 29 let no corrupt
[21:05] communication proceed out of your mouth
[21:06] are your conversations supposed to be
[21:08] holy that the words that you say and the
[21:10] actions that you that portray or
[21:12] everything's supposed to be holy
[21:15] brother Ram would say on backsliding now
[21:19] see these are things that we're talking
[21:21] about a born-again Christian he said on
[21:23] backsliding I wish somebody would go to
[21:25] ask me that but on backsliding remember
[21:27] you backslide every day every day we
[21:30] make mistakes every day we do things
[21:32] that are Grievous to the Holy Spirit we
[21:34] need to repent of
[21:35] but see those things are more when
[21:37] you're a baby and grow less as you
[21:40] mature
[21:41] there's no way at all for you to keep
[21:43] out of out of it but you backslide to
[21:47] the people in the church but not before
[21:48] God see you backslide on Christ but you
[21:51] don't own God because when you sin
[21:53] you're gone but you're constantly
[21:55] falling Paul had to die every day is
[21:58] that right he had to die every day
[22:00] repent every day and just constantly
[22:02] repenting all the time
[22:07] so we don't want to grieve the Holy
[22:08] Spirit
[22:09] I'ma skip over that you know we we
[22:12] should be conscious of the Holy Spirit
[22:14] what the Holy Spirit likes and what the
[22:16] Holy Spirit doesn't like like Elijah in
[22:18] that cave listens to that still Small
[22:20] Voice when the holy spirit says you've
[22:22] done something wrong aren't you glad for
[22:24] that that little twinge when you said
[22:26] something wrong to somebody I've heard
[22:27] people say I say things to people all
[22:29] the time and I never feel bad about it
[22:31] boy I do I I feel sometimes I say
[22:34] something and harsh to my wife or my
[22:37] children and I you just got to apologize
[22:39] I think that's the mark of somebody
[22:42] that's coming close to maturity when you
[22:43] can get down and say I'm sorry or or you
[22:46] know some there's a mark of something
[22:48] really Supernatural taking in place in
[22:50] your life when you feel bad because
[22:53] you're doing something listen to the
[22:55] Holy Spirit when you grieve the Holy
[22:57] Spirit turn around and make it right
[22:59] when it says you got to make something
[23:01] right or when you say you need to says
[23:03] you need to do something differently or
[23:05] something's off or you listen to it or
[23:07] when something's listen to that Holy
[23:09] that still Small Voice when it says
[23:11] something's off kilter when those when
[23:13] those guys start coming around talking
[23:15] to your daughters or or vice versa the
[23:17] girls there's there's a still Small
[23:19] Voice that'll tell everybody something's
[23:21] off and you listen to that listen to
[23:23] that still Small Voice because it's
[23:24] there for a purpose
[23:26] and back to where we started from and
[23:28] the message testimony brother Brown said
[23:31] when you move or Stir It just shakes me
[23:33] now
[23:34] you think about brother Branham saying
[23:36] this and and how close he was with God
[23:39] and how should we look at the Holy
[23:41] Spirit and the way that we live he would
[23:44] he would say I lose the anointing so
[23:46] quickly
[23:47] and he would say the holy spirit is very
[23:50] timid
[23:51] how many knows that very timid
[23:54] and the message Jesus Christ the same
[23:56] yesterday today and forever he would say
[23:57] now don't do that see you're moving
[24:00] around he said I'll have to stop
[24:03] first thing you know my son will be
[24:05] beating me on the side brother Billy
[24:06] Paul will come up and pull on him and
[24:07] tell him it's time for him to stop
[24:09] preaching and that means go see be
[24:11] Reverend just be quiet just for one more
[24:14] will you then we'll just ask them to lay
[24:16] their hands on one another when you get
[24:18] up like that it Grieves the Holy Spirit
[24:20] and I and I gets away from me and I
[24:23] can't control it see because he Grieves
[24:25] and he leaves me why why would the holy
[24:28] spirit because the holy spirit is so
[24:29] timid now you think about this morning
[24:31] in in the church the holy spirit is so
[24:33] the Holy Spirit doesn't want to be in a
[24:35] building where people are indifferent
[24:36] where they don't care about the service
[24:38] where they're not engaged where they're
[24:39] not listening or it's just something
[24:40] else where they can check it off their
[24:42] list the Holy Spirit doesn't want to be
[24:44] in a building where people are not
[24:45] believing where they're not wanting to
[24:47] be there oh but if you want to be there
[24:49] then the Holy Spirit wants to be there
[24:52] too oh you think maybe maybe this is a
[24:54] little bit hard I can I can kind of tear
[24:56] about by the Expressions on your faces
[24:58] maybe that you're pushing back a little
[25:00] bit but the Holy Spirit wants to be
[25:02] where he's welcome and if you'll welcome
[25:04] the Holy Spirit the holy spirit will
[25:06] come and all we can think we'll meditate
[25:08] on that this morning
[25:10] if you want the Holy Spirit to be active
[25:12] in your life welcoming if you want the
[25:14] Holy Spirit to be active in the church
[25:16] and moving welcome him and don't do
[25:19] things that grieve the holy spirit
[25:20] because the holy spirit is very timid
[25:23] the holy spirit is very timid God bless
[25:26] you Saints
[25:32] there you go
[25:37] like
