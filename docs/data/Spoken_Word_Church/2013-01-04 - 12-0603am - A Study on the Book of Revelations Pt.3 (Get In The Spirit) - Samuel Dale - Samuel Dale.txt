========================================

oh because that's what we're here for but joe gave me something i thought was very interesting and i'll just read it to you one of the musicians are going back it says if you have food in your fridge clothes on your back a roof over your head and a place to sleep you are richer than 75 of the world if you have money in the bank your wallet and some spare change you're among the top eight percent of the world's wealthy now see that's not on the downside that means it's wearing that if you woke up this morning with more help than illness you are more blessed than the million people who will not survive this week if you have never experienced the danger of battle or the agony of imprisonment or torture or horrible pains of starvation you are luckier than 50 million people alive and suffering if you can read this message you're more fortunate than three billion people in the world who cannot read it all seven billion people in the world and three billion people can't even read that's something amen good to see everyone in the house of the lord you like turn in your scriptures turn to revelations 1 where we've been reading from now remember the lord willing wade and june will be traveling back tomorrow he's preaching for brother claude today and let's just pray that the lord would be with him i thank you announced brother deans you have brother harris says he's preaching foreign all right so just remember that and pray for these and uh do you know you know all right now while you're standing we want to get a couple announcements and that way you can't say you didn't hear it uh as of starting this afternoon all right the musicians are asked to come and play and we've toyed up and down of how many minutes and what to do and backwards and forth but the musicians are asked to come and play 10 minutes someone's 15 something different but the musicians will come and start playing 10 minutes before any of the services sunday morning sunday evening you know wednesday night 10 minutes early all right that way then they will be responsible to musicians of getting here and you know being here in the church and playing at 10 minutes before the service and 10 minutes of live music no singing now not to sing with it or anything just playing as people are coming in you know we have the other one running but then we will turn over to 10 minutes so then josh will be cutting the sound system off at 10 minutes till and that'll you know that'll put it to the bases that they will be starting their playing so the musicians will be responsible for you know getting together and figuring out what they want to do we will do it basically as we would do the piano will be the leading type of instrument to start and play you know because that'll keep it all going and then we will have it on that basis starting as of this afternoon okay everybody understand 10 minutes early music being played not to sing with it just playing the music and having it you know up on that basis all right also now to help with the congestion that we have on the outward of trying to come up and coming in all right now now this is going to require some of you adults you know to participate in something because what we're going to do is rachel and sister rachel and sister monica they want a time because see they don't have i sit back here so i see who comes in and what comes in what and see they don't get 15 minutes so we've done an ounce don't go through that room now and see don't do that form of doing and causing them trouble you know um but they're going to start 10 minutes early that will be 10 minutes till 10. so now if you come through that door will be locked from that power don't come the other door be to close the other way don't go through you're not supposed to be doing it anyway you're already supposed to be up here okay so don't go in there beating and banging around and everything because the sunday school class will be going on at 10 minutes till on sunday morning and then that will put them getting out the 20 minutes after and that way the children can come up and go to the bathroom and everything and they will be uh just they bring them up to the bathrooms and everything so your children will be brought up to here and you they will be you know the classes will be sent to the bathroom and that'll get that congestion out to where that when then you're coming up to the sunday school some of you going to the bathroom you know when you come up so that'll put a little bit of a different uh different situation and all and i said then that's going to mean that some of your parents are going to have to get here a little bit earlier so sometimes some of you get here uh five after now i'm just honest and i'm not mean but just hateful okay there's a difference in the word you know but you don't do that to your work all right this is more important than your work and see then that's what i said you don't come in downstairs and and causing a lot of confusion over in the other side there while uh you know while the sunday school classes is going on you know and all like that because we will if necessary we will assign a deacon to make sure that you come in and all and we should be in here i've never been one to worry that you've got to do right now but we should at least be in here 15 minutes before service starts 30 minutes is better but that's hard i'm honest you travel a long ways and and i try to be as nice as i can about that but we need to be here 15 minutes early come in the services and sit down and praying and listening to the music you know being played then the the live music will start 10 minutes before the service time and that will give you time to relax a little bit and get everything in the way you know straight so is everybody understand that starting this afternoon from then on 10 minutes before the music will start of the piano playing you know in the musical instruments playing of live music and not singing with them just you know letting them play and letting it be a a time and then we'll have that from now on on that services and then the sunday school class will be starting 10 minutes earlier sister monica's now consistent rachel's now don't come up to tomorrow or next week say oh wait you know where bobby you gonna start 10 minutes early i'm not talk i'm telling you what time all right everybody understand it's for those two classes only to where we can get the children upstairs to be able to do away with a little confusion out at the front so everybody understand okay all right then that'll that'll take care of that so i i've got myself notes to write down here to do but you know that we we had a good time yesterday at the bible study we've just finished up on all the officers of the church offices and officers of the church and we will be back on regular questions the next time so just remember that okay revelations one i think that's all the announcements see because brother joe starts they start the video in somewhere on the order of 15 minutes till you know they start the camera running for anybody live streaming never having to say that word you know and getting it straightened out and that way we'll put everything in order we're glad to have our brother back there with us he's not a visitor uh brother's brother dave he's not fisting with us he said the lord got a hold of him out in kansas and told him to get straightened up so they had car trouble going that away you know both vans i mean both things broke down the meeting was there but that was worth it all right work it out okay straighten up let's go all right let's read their let's pray and read our scripture all right father we thank you we love you and we ask you to just help us guide us we need you lord this day to come among us to guide us and and give us understanding of what to say bless those that are not here with us remember wait in june they're traveling back and just be with him tomorrow lord and have your way with him today there is he's ministering you sound a little creepy this morning when i talk to it so just bless him and take care of him and just let your love be made manifest in each one of the hearts and lives there and also here today we have we just ask you to forgive our sins because we want to stand complete in you and to guide us in your love guide us now as we read and have your way in jesus name amen revelations what are we using this is just the basis for the the part that we're in but we're in revelations one 1-3 and the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show it to his servants things which must shortly come to pass and sitting sent and signified by his angel and to his servant john who bear record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand you may be seated as a little daddy's blessing to the reading of the word now remember we were covering the other day if i have time i'll get back into the end of the message one but we were covering how the word prophecy it's a setting in order of scriptures you know in the book of revelation then would be the summation of all of the things and bringing it down to a basis of setting everything in order and bringing it to that place and i noticed it when i was looking up studying on this a little uh this morning that it says three times the testimony of jesus it says uh excuse the testimony of jesus christ that we just read here and then it says one time the testimony of jesus and uh then that's the spirit of prophecy the testimony of jesus revelation 19 i believe says it's the spirit of prophecy and see that's sitting in order of scripture so our we're looking at the book of revelations not as an addition to any of the writing you know we're adding to the bible or anything but looking at it as the the one that is is prevalent or most important for our day because it's going to show us who we are and what we're doing here in the book of revelation the one that we were told to stay away from now satan doesn't want us to to read the book of revelation and to understand it so then he attacks that and says you can't understand it well by way of the prophet's message we can understand the things that are said and don't have to worry about it see we know what he said these things mean and like i said if you want to know what they mean you take my bible and read the side of it because i write down what he says these things are and everything because i want to keep up with it myself all right now but it's a revelation of jesus christ that we read that god gave to jesus all right to give to john now when you say but yeah but jesus was god how is it that he didn't understand when you have god in you how it is that you don't understand everything right but see he knew everything but he didn't know about his coming right that was withholding from him and the fact of what was going to be the future in the church you know the future part of the church all right was withholding from him and here when he comes to patmos he has went through the death burial resurrection you know ascension and then receives the prophet said from the father of the future of what would be all right and see then it when it does then he can see the book of revelations that i've tried to say to you it is the one book written directly to you and i the others would be written to the ephesians which means it's to us because you know it's in the book but it was written to the corinthians all right but see the book of revelation is written to you and i yes all right it's our book it's the most important book that we could think about because it shows the christ the present and the future all right and it shows those things and brings in the light the the opening of the entire world so then whatever would not be comprehended now listen to this point but around my statement one time he said if you miss it in the seals and things he said come back to christ's mystery and this is worse he said come back to this message christ the mystery see then that would explain the seals and things into that order all right now so if you don't understand what is in you know this is going to be reversed to what mankind thinks but if you don't understand what's in ephesians are you listening go to the book of revelation that's right now pause for that to be thought about and the emphasis is what you don't understand the seals you didn't say you had to go back and stay in the seals and keep reading what you need to do what do you say come to the christ the mystery right because that would help you understand those things all right so if we don't understand the godhead of john where it says god is a spirit then go to the book of revelations and it will explain that to us it'll unfold it because it's the revealing the making gnome i think go ahead and pull up number one brother forgive me for my throat but we talked a good bit last night then we was around 12 getting into bed and ate too much ice cream and sat around and talked too much but really enjoyed it had a good time with brother being in sister brenda and uh you know just listening to old things and thinking about where we've been down to time but i guess it left my throat just aggravating enough but that's all right i can whisper you know we'll draw it out on the board you know we'll take care of it one way or the other but look what he says now in the church age book page 13 this is the revelation jesus christ which is actually called the church age book now the greek word for revelation is apocalypse which means unveiling this unveiling is perfectly described in the example of a sculpture unveiling this work of statuary exposing it to the onlooker it is an uncovering revealing what was previously hidden all right now listen now the uncovering is not only the revelation of the person of christ listen but is the revelation of his future works in the oncoming seven church ages all right now so it's not going to be dealing i've told you over and over the book of revelation you never see jesus by himself you see him with his bride you see him in his bride revealing himself to his bride or whatever you know but you never see him by himself because remember on the death pentecost when the holy ghost come and started the new testament church it was revealing jesus christ living in mankind right now we come and we'll get just mention it more maybe this afternoon because see then you can get in the church ages and actually go back to the and connect it to the book of acts because the first church age started about 1890 i mean uh 1853 that's where paul coming through you know all right so then it would tie back and connect it together and the book of revelation was written about 1895. all right now it's going to be revealing christ in his church how much greater could that be than to find a book that we could read that's talking about us i hope you you you know you you anchor your teeth into that and think on it we think well we can't understand the book of revelation why not the prophet has brought us to understand it the symbols have been explained but the biggest problem is is we can't see ourselves and that's hard to look at because we look at ourselves in the wrong way we look at how bad we are and we'll get to it the lord within this afternoon that before he even comes into the church ages to write okay you know what's happening what would take place on earth he already described how perfect the church is before he writes anything about what she's done now record that in your mind and it'll help you to see what god is doing and it'll help you to understand how that the lamb could be slain before the foundation of the world and all could be done because surely if we believe in god we ought to believe him enough to realize that he knows the beginning of the ending if he doesn't then he's like me and you changing her mind every day but we know that's not true now that's the emphasis of my whole thing and i keep referring to it every service to tie our minds into thinking about that we're talking about ourselves it's not armand neville written in the bible right but when armand neville's on earth and what he's doing you know what's taking place he said his name's in the book well then that's our names in the book it's so simple until we stumble all over it i always try to emphasize it you know that the uh stumbling stone when people stumble over uh you take a uh a whole football field you know and there's nothing on it i forgot what is it wide 50 yards wide but it's 100 yards long and uh nothing on it but lines drawn out and then one rock laying in the middle of it and you're looking for it you know the mankind was supposed to be looking for god to come and stumble over it trying to find it now that's you know i know that's carnality but it's pretty sensible too you think about it let's don't stumble over the word trying to find it that's right it's already been delivered unto us given into our hands all right so then it's the revelation of his future work the godhead is explained throughout the bible life and immortality is brought to light through the scripture all right the bible explains that jesus says unless you believe that i am healed in your sins then the book of revelation is not just dealing with trying to explain the godhead as much as it's dealing with explaining the godhead and where it's at that is in the people that's right and we're seeing a picture of ourselves of how perfect we are in god's eyes before we ever even see it you know before it ever takes place all right now if you don't get that mess get that point because that's what i want dwelling in our mind all right in the book of revelations we never see him alone we see him in bright form or we see him with the bride you know like revelation 19 to make riding with him you know whatever you know and we see the lamb standing there but it might be interesting one day when we get to revelations 5 to talk about that lamb the lamb that takes the book that might be interesting when we get there because remember that lamb has seven horns and seven eyes which is the church itself right so put that down and think on it as we go along all right now it's the revelation that god give to jesus because he didn't understand when he would be coming back he said well he was gone he said he understood all things don't it was withholding from him that's right if god i noticed brother richard wilkes wilson they would mention they would always say if god can have amnesia oh that's impossible well evidently it's not because our sins can be put in the sea of forgetfulness and god can't remember them when i thought god could know everything he does but what he decides he don't want to remember you know and i don't mean this wrong now i just try to think in a carnal way you know we think about alzheimer's and i like that every time you say those words but you know you've ever thought about it you look at a person sitting there and they they can't remember you know i know i'm carnal i know that but forgive me but you know there's a lot of things i'd like to be able to not remember right i mean a lot of things i wish i couldn't remember you know well are they cursed or are they blessed you know i just look at things differently i know it's it's a bad thing but it's mainly because we and you know come on i know i get in trouble trying to explain things but still you know you go into people and the first thing you do you go in like somebody that's real sick what's your first thing you remember me right in that 90 of the time you remember me you know who i am unless you ain't helping the person you say i just want to know if they can remember why why don't you tell them who you are might be like i told you before about my brother gave my mother a ring because you know daddy never had one to give to her my brother gave my mother a wedding man hanging you know had a little stone in it but he told me he said when you pass away i went back but we were sitting there until we took care of her house and you know and she was laying there we thought like liking a coma you know whatever just not saying nothing my brother would have taken it off it would just turn over and a little stone was pushed into her finger and it just reached down and turned it back over you know to get it from pressing in she said leave it alone i ain't dead yet well when i think about life in a different form in a way why you want to go in you know who i am don't tell them who you are that's right you know what i'm saying when you're doing all right you said when you're you're telling them who you are well the birds on me and you get the point we we we run a lot of things and i don't mean to get into all that i don't charge for those things but listen church i think it's about time to realize who we are and our purpose for being here it's not too good of a day to try to figure out what we're going to do and what we're going to have because tomorrow we might not have you know it's the time to realize who we are god's got a purpose for you and i to find out who we are he wasn't denying his family he said i found out i'm a child of god it's time you and i realize who we are and our purpose for being here is to conquer satan right well that can't be done let's see there's where you you just first off you lied because the bible says we can i said all things are possible to them that believe so you're lying about it and you're not facing up to what see we're chosen for an end time to bring somebody's got to come to a change of the body right right but how can we come to a change of the body if we don't realize who we are and our purpose for being here maybe it'll work all right jesus didn't know when he was coming right and the prophet said in the same way he didn't know what was going to be in the future about the church you know the operation the daily part to him being in the church he knew he came to die he knew that things but i know i think cardinal but as i said god if god can have amnesia why can't we think of jesus being human enough to work that things had to be made known to it that was that inside making outside known right and see then god had never made the god inside of him had never made known to the outside man he is part of what was going to be because i think i honestly believe i believe that one day when they handed him the scroll you know when he sat down there and he read isaiah and he when he read isaiah 61 the spirit of the lord's upon me because he hasn't wanted me to see he only read heist because when he started reading it it was made alive so he stopped and didn't read the rest of it so because that'll be for another day then he looked back and he said this day this scripture is revealed to me all right when are we going to do that to get to that point all right get on into what we're trying to do he didn't know when he would come he didn't know he's part of the kingdom my point is trying to get one thing that god has come to join our patmos to reveal the future of the church all right as i say we basically most of the time reading the bible we read the bible to try to find out how bad we are right yes we want to know what we've done how about does the bible say it's wrong because remote used to say i don't know it had a point of funny way of expressing it and said you know you talk about stealing he said you know the bible don't say thou shalt not steal chicken you don't say that then you scripture but see it tells you not to steal them well then it would cover all animals but you see then are we reading the bible to try to find out what god is saying about us or are we trying to find out what he's saying the bad part about us sure we want to get rid of the things of our life right sure we want to quit things that god says we shouldn't be doing and we want to do the things that that he said we should be doing right but why can't we read it to find out who we are the entire bible is written to show us who we are then the book of revelations counts it off by actually showing us when something is revealed to you to you you know that's as real as almost that you can make it that's right right if i run around and say he said if god told me to go raise george washington from the dead he said i'd invite the world why because if he showed him he was raised george washington was already raised as far as he was concerned right see that's the way a revelation is so when god shows the church what i love and i'll try not to spend much time in it because i'm wanting to get on over but yeah i love to read and see like verse one maybe of the church age and how bad we are and like i said what we need to get rid of i i that's fine but i like to read the last verses to that age because every one of them says to him that overcome it well you know as far as god is concerned he's not seeing what we're doing if he's seeing what we were doing he'd have to kill us for doing it that's right but he sees the lamb that paid the price that's right so he's not looking at us that's right well see that's where that most of your preachers preach what you're doing and what you're not doing now come on first i'm not that bad just try to express it a little but you know it's true they spend their time trying to condemn you to straighten you up the lord call me to straighten the church up no the lord called me to preach the gospel illustrating the church he didn't call me to straighten up the church that's bad business because who am i going to start with i'm starting to pull pip first i never would be able to get out of the pulpit right because every time i get one thing straight you ever done that you ever had something bothering you yes you think if i could get over this oh would it be wonderful if i get over this you get over that and this board is pretty good for a little while you know but all at once here goes something else then you got to start working on that one because we're just human mortals all right we see we need to get down to the point of believing that the bible is telling us who we are and not only does god tell us who we are you know we're his children we're his offspring all right but he's telling us how precious we are in his side he's telling us what he look what we looked like through his eyes he said well boy that's bad because of what he looked on because he can't see us he only sees the blood you can't see what we're doing the church that's what i'm trying to get us to understand then the book of revelation is just summing up and showing who we are he said but but brother dallas if we go too far into that we'll go out into the world no matter what we do deceiving your own self by him revealing to me how perfect i am you know where that carries me to my knees right because i know what i am i don't have to be told what i am right i know what i am so then it'll be in that way when he starts telling me what he thinks about me you know i mean if you want to really have a day home or something just get all of these sisters together with their bright books you know then pictures of the kids and the grandkids you know well you know you don't start out and you know and look down and there's a baby and then you grow up you know you don't look down to said that dirty rascal is a drug addict don't talk to mama about her kids okay right you get into trouble if you want to get along with grandmas you talk with grandmas about the good things you know you don't throw off on the kids or the grandkids cause they you know they're blind they just can't see it now they know what happened we get what's in it look at the baby and they don't think about all the it has to see later pictures it makes them start thinking about the wrong things in life we don't i don't know later pictures he made one picture you know what i like about it we can put all the emphasis in how how old we was 18 20 years old or something you know prior to the prime of life the thing but you know most people don't ever read enough to realize where that picture was made what do you mean it made one 1820 no no no it was made before the foundation of the world of prophecy it wasn't made sister gayle when you were 18 or 20 in your prime it was made before the world well then it's not a picture of you in 1820 it's a picture of what he sees oh they can take these things now you know they can take an old rugby face like mine and they can just doctor that up and and man they you know they make you look good but don't change nothing i can put on all kinds of stuff to make me look good it don't change my hand but just get what i'm saying god so much of his bride in the end time and i keep emphasizing that because you know yourself what you think now how many of you think this way i wish i'd have been back there i wish i'd been there when when jesus was this or that i wish i'd been back there when brother branham was here no i'm glad to be here right i mean there's no way i want to erase we talk about that this morning i wouldn't want to raise my life for nothing i've told you over and over there's a lot of things in my life i don't like i wish i could get rid of without changing me but you know if i got rid of them things i wouldn't be who i am so good or bad i just take it like it is what i've been through in life has made me what i am but what about god not even seeing us wrong i can't get away from that point that's just you know let's see now look he's revealing his presence to us all right so let's start in a little bit i didn't think you're gonna be on this but all right let's just read a little bit of the things that you understand let's go to verse 4 of brother anderson there's any way for you to pull up because you would own three want to go and he's going to scroll down you know one two three revelations one can you pull revelations one four like through a to describe it you know and while they're working on that to get it i want you to notice something that's very odd to me anytime god repeats something it means like where he says very very i say unto you all right now for him to repeat something the prophet said it one day like this he said he's emphasizing you know led emphasis upon the point so when he says verily verily surely surely i stay under these pearson he's emphasized now what i want you to do i've never counted to see how many they are but we're going to read verse 1 through down through eight in revelations one but i want you to notice how many times it says and all right then in your mind translate the word from and to even because that's interchangeable word every time an ant is used it's not meaning even but you know like paul said to god and father that's two people god ansi but when you say god even father it totally changed the thought didn't it you come back to one understanding of who it is it's not two gods so then use that in your mind and think about it but now just notice how many times that when you get down we'll start on verse four brother so roll it up to the top john to the seven churches which are in asia grace be unto you and you don't have to move it to there but that's good even peace from him which he is and now for a second what i'm talking about when it's used is and i'll use the word even okay so then we'll read it john to the seven church ages which are your names of grace be unto you even peace from him which is even which was even which is to come emphasizing the one even from the seven spirits which are before his throne now we've got them here if you need them so there's no need of scrolling even up in it to find them but there's not seven spirits of god and i have a quote in here for good time we'll get back and read it but brother brown said it's like explaining in corinthians about the uh gifts and times he said it's one holy spirit with nine gifts right all right so it's seven times god uses the the uh spirit of god down to the ages and that's the emphasis i put onto the life's messenger of the holy spirit in every age to make it blind be in our minds and line up that that it's not seven spirits i don't have seven holy spirits it's one holy spirit manifesting himself in seven ways through the seven church age messengers all right it's one holy spirit manifesting himself in the millions of born-again christians that from there up until now not a different holy spirit so then when you talk about is the word that was eat down in the ages not the holy spirit right it was the holy spirit in those ages that was the emphasis all right now we're coming up to the point of what from the seven spirits not seven spirits but it was selling spirits and be selling thrones right so then you agreed seven spirits which are before seven thrones because you'd have to have a throne for each one of them if not you've got to throw them full of spirits right you know seven spirits sitting on one throne but you see we needed the prophet to explain them things to us and to emphasize the things to work that we would understand what it's talking about it's talking about the church age messenger and the spirit of god through those men and the spirit of god in each church age giving the new birth to the people and leading the people in that age all right and what don't keep in their point now verse 5 even from jesus christ who is the faithful witness even the first begotten of the dead even the prince of the kings of the earth there's no emphasis made then upon trinitarianism in any form that's what i'm trying to erase from our minds you say well brother dale what do you mean i've never been a trinitarian i never was out there i don't understand the doctor was born one they born one we were born with a carnal mind a carnal mind right to not be able to understand so then it just keeps on going unto him that loved us even washed us from our sins in his own blood i'm just emphasizing it that he's showing us this is a description of you and i it's a description of him yes but where's he at he's in you and i manifesting himself and has made us kings even priests verse six unto god even his father to him be glory even dominion forever even ever it is emphasizing the point he's showing a picture of you and i starts right off the book of revelations telling us it's a revelation that's going to be given to jesus christ of himself and his works in the church all right that one through three that we've been reading all right and then it would be showing the bride and what he thinks of us before he ever gets to chapter two to start writing about what we've done he's already telling us how perfect we are but see our problem is we look through our own eyes not only at other people we look at our own sails now sometimes we lie to ourselves tell us how beautiful we are but we got enough sense to know right like i've always told you there's more muscle strain my weight lifters in front of a mirror you know doing the pumping their muscles than they are pulling on the weights you know but there's no need to lie i know i get in trouble by trying to say things and then i say that something like my wife you know and then she'll say well why'd you bring that out i don't look as pretty as i did no we're not as pretty as we used to be but in my eyes she's just as beautiful as she was the day i married her why because she's my wife and i love her yeah i know i'm not the guy she married i'm old but her eyes got damn right she can't see it's because she used to you have to be along with her that because you put her hair on the floor and she'd find it anything i'll do this come here honey find a screw i don't look all over the place you look clarity yes when you see that one you know but see that's just life all right but not get the point it's not seven spirits it's the holy spirit that's right dealing in the church ages all right now in doing that it connects to every verse to show us the and the and the and as even not another one not and meaning one thing and then another one you see if you reach this way you go to town and get a loaf and a pound of bananas all right now you don't read that you go to town to get a loaf of bread even a pound of bananas now you don't let one of them out right come on i know that's carnal but is it sensible you left one of those off you're only going to get one but when god says god and father god even father he's not talking about two people he's talking about the one person and how beautiful it is all right now i want to emphasize a minute one thing do we believe we are the children of god by the new birth do we believe the bible and what it says we are his offspring amen now if we are the children of god then you can run a dna to find out whether we're real or not right now that's the word you know that's what they do to find out whether we're really the children of god is to go into the word it's not go down and find out how we shout and scream and glory hallelujah and all that's well and good you know how we are and how good we are is to go and see what we think about this word because this word not only was my father writing to me this word is my father writing about me now can you separate you know we have wade karen anna now can you separate them from me irregardless if anna got married see and her maiden name changed to roberts all right i mean her name changed robert her maiden name was dale she got dale blood right and it'll never change because your children are you reproduced right right the dna proves it the things that we run through but what about in god when seeing in in natural they had to be a a a um what's the word procreating is that the ones you use you know they had to be uh uh some take place between me and my wife to bring the kids all right but see in god by the new birth he didn't just make us another person by the new birth he makes you his offspring which is him in another form right right he said well i'm a son of god you see a lot of people believe in trinitarianism right now which one are you in trinitarianism which one are you are you a son of jesus are you a son of god or your son of the holy spirit so trinitarianism won't work you would be divided up and trying to figure out where you come from but in the one true and living god the father son and holy ghost is the same lord jesus christ so then that would make you god make manifest in another form is that true we're not just the offspring like some offspring that is made we are him made manifest so he's not describing you and i in the book of revelation come on you understand follow that word you're not describing what you're looking at that's right he's not describing samuel dale and his attitudes and ways and things and doing that's the part of the the church ages that he always has to kind of click us a little bit but he's talking about himself in you and i not another person but himself may manifest in you and i well brother dale if i believe that i'd be shouting why don't you what i think about what god says we thought long enough about what we thought we talked long enough about ourselves i like that song you know so what sims are you talking about huh so you can't always say it over and over you can't accuse my dad he's been dead since 1945. you can't accuse him of doing something today and even if i've done something it's not credited to him hey he's telling us if we be dead in christ i mean why can't we start looking at that hey listen folks see some people are worried that you preach to people and get them to free now don't you worry about it because the devil ain't gonna let you get free if he does you belong to him if you ever get the idea well it don't matter what i do i'm a christian all right you're not a christian isn't that sensible you're the devil's child you're deceived well i can get my way because i'm a christian no you can't get by brother said you sent us in as a christian you'll reap a top four don't you worry about the devil's gonna keep beating on us to keep us from getting to play to the place that we find out we're too perfect he's going to beat on us too much until god's going to have to cut the work short if he don't there ain't going to be no flesh saying that's what the bible says the prophet said you see we say well bless god brother dale i can't be deceived you're quoting good you're talking good but what are you going to do where the prophet said if and the bible says if he didn't cut the work short there'd be no flesh saved now what are you gonna do that what are you gonna do with the prophet saying you know that we're seeing every day what are you gonna do with those type of things you see we've got to get to the basis of seeing the way god sees things that's where problem is because that's that's the point of what we're talking about we'll get to because you're going down to verse 9 of what we've been there now and he said john he said he was in the spirit all right and we know enough to know all the things we don't need the quotes i've got them laid here if you'd like them when the prophet talks about you go to a ball game you don't go down to a ball game and said turn like all fire you know whenever your teams are winning oh i was good oh you do like the kids that was cool me and zach was going through jefferson one day and the guy right in front of us just smacked the far out of the back of a car and zach was about four years old 10 or 12. and this guy run right in powder in the back exactly told me he said that was cool wouldn't it well i just think he's too cool and i'm sure the guy got run into it and thank you why would you see him no cool but listen church if you get in the spirit you know they brought around said you cannot get the holy spirit without getting in the spirit now you didn't say the spirit fall on you then you get in the spirit right he says you can't get in the spirit you know i mean you've got to get in the spirit to get the holy spirit getting in the spirit but do we pray for a revelation how many today prayed that god would speak to you this morning here in the church before you came i mean you don't have to get down and beg him to do and i'm just talking about you know on the road you're thinking driving up the road to the lord i assure you hope is a good service today we'll see how i count that as talking to god you know what you'd be in a prayerful attitude and never say never get down on your knees and pray and do all those things you just live in a prayerful attitude you ever just go around thanking god for what he's done never do that just thank him i get up in the middle of the night and go to the bathroom you know and everything and then i thank him for getting me up and letting me go to the bathroom you know like we read a lot of people incapable of doing that that catheters take care of that problem but listen church we need to get in the spirit more than anything in the world now we get in the spirit of everything we do in life and living and things like that that's all and i i'm not one to say you can't go to the ball game yeah but if you emphasize the ball game above the church then you miss it you go to the ball games and the things like that hunting fishing whatever you do it and you go do it deliberately on sunday and miss the services in this room wrong i'm just honest but if we just in the spirit can live in the spirit let's run through these in a hurry okay because there's some in there i want to make sure we just read them go ahead brother pull up all right there that's the one that i went through that well ago because this is explaining the seven spirits to begin with this is taken for 248 church eight books already in church age to begin with we know that certainly these verses are not teaching a new and country doctrine to john 4 24a which says god is a one spirit but this is like first corinthians 12 8 through 11 wherein we find one spirit manifesting himself in nine ways thus we know that the seven spirits of god mean it is the one and same spirit coming forth in a seven-fold way go ahead and screw the other and we'll read as fast as we can it is very evident that the word they refers to men thus we see that the eyes of the lord in this testicle that's what he's talking about to plummet there's a ruble in the thighs of the lord of course they will be the be anointed men full of the holy ghost for god's ministries are not in the power of men but of the holy ghost putting our scriptures discoveries together it is evident that the seven spirits of god refer to the continuous ministry of the same holy spirit in the lives of seven men with whom god identifies himself very closely they are his eyes and they are his lamps who these seven men are can easily be seen because the next verse calls them the seven stars which you already know which is the messenger of the age go ahead to the next huh yes this is 251 church eight book yes the spirit is not seven spirits but one he will always be the same and act the same all right now and the seven messengers will have the same spirit and teach the same word and have the same power if the church is the true church it will have the very same spirit and word and acts of power that they had at pentecost by experience it will be a pentecostal church and there will be tongues and interpretation and prophecy and healings god will be in the midst of her and god will declare himself in the midst of her as he always has hallelujah and she will be unorganized don't forget that now you say well we don't have tom we don't have a shout out you me we don't have it you know what you're saying you're saying y'all don't have it you're not saying we right you're saying it's everybody else's fault so if you think that we don't have tons of interpretation why don't you do something about it and shut up dropping about what everybody else and thinking y'all don't have it i'm in the spirit but won't you act like like i always tell everybody you know if you're happy let your face know it right come on get the next one okay this is talking about getting in the spirit this is what i want to get to and you can't do any good until first you get in the spirit god can't use you that's right okay you're you're you're you're he stutters real good all your efforts are are in vain until first you do it in the spirit if i will sing i will sing in the spirit if i'll pray he said paul i pray and then if there is anything that comes to me that's any good it has to be revealed to me by the spirit and confirmed by the word made manifest by the results it bears okay so now it's our problem if we don't get in the spirit god can't use us you come in and sit down like a fired up prune and want everybody else to why why is everybody else not happy today you know that brother brown says one person hinder the spirit of god and we'll have to give an account he said a judgment for that there are certain people that i don't want to come to church here no you know why because they've never changed yet and they can come in here and lock this place down because everybody's got in the spirit of that person well brother dale's mean i know but i have to fight them out of service well why don't you just tell the person to leave then see that way i wouldn't be i wouldn't be loving the person that's right i love people and i want them to be helped so there's not a person in the world i don't want to see in this church did that change it around where you can understand what i'm talking about i want everybody to come but it wants all to be in the spirit of god and be happy and joyous and be you know rejoicing about god's word all right now go ahead with the next all right now this is the patmos vision uh not this this is 1204 which is the sea reason all right now it was in the spirit of the lord's day now remember the first thing you have to do is what get in the spirit yours how's these revelations going to ever come to you you know what most people don't get a revelation right here it is they don't get a revelation cause they don't get in the spirit to receive it amen how's these revelations going to ever come to you get in the spirit are you ever going to get the holy ghost get in the spirit was that right what i said a while ago how are you going to get the holy spirit you got to get the spirit to get the holy spirit you know i want it you know i love you lord that means told him to date you loved him or you like the fella was you know his wife said honey you told me when you love me you know when you married me that day she loved me and said it's 20 years now you ain't never told me again he said if i ever change my mind let you know well is that the way we would thank god you know thank my mind lord i'll tell you i love you now that's not exactly the way it's supposed to be all right now go ahead to the next one this is off the patmos vision church book now page 43 i was in the spirit isn't that just beautiful my i love that if you could just call these words the whole of the christian life what getting in the spirit if we are going to live as christians we have to be in his spirit john was not talking about being in his own spirit that would not have brought these visions now come on john patmos wouldn't talk about being his own spirit it wouldn't brought the vision it had to be the spirit of god it has to be the spirit of god with us to our all our efforts are inviting paul said i i will pray in the spirit i will sing in the spirit i live in the spirit if there's anything good that will come to me it has to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word and made manifest by the results it bears as surely as john needed to be in the spirit to receive these tremendous revelations fresh from jesus we need to be in the spirit in the in the spirit to understand the revelation that god has given to us to live by in his word for it is the same spirit one to the next this is patma's vision paragraph 40 or page 42 oh we need to get in the spirit and then things will be done don't go through the acts first acts means we come to church today right we come to church today that's the axe all right but what should we come to church for don't go through the acts first get in the spirit and then go through the acts and watch what god will do go ahead to the next one this is the fatma's vision going back to the church age part 6 1960. in the spirit of the lord's day we hear it now we hear it now what now what was he doing he was transferred from the aisle now in the spirit over into the lord's day and as soon as he got over into the lord's day he heard a trumpet what is it it's somebody approaching a great one's approaching trumpet sound somebody's coming he looked hallelujah it what then i'm out for an amiga this is the one on so watch before i show you anything now you ready before i show you anything i want you i want to let you know who i am now i'm coming back to the point i was trying to emphasize to start with in the book of revelation is god revealing himself to a church you know a distance away or something or is he revealing himself in the church my emphasis on this whole thing is he's revealing himself in the church he's revealing where he's at he's in the church he's in the bride not in the church there's a difference in the bride in the church let's see the church is going through the tribulation right with the bride ain't so there's a difference in it but he's using those words and what before i say show you anything i want to let you know who i am the greatest of all the revelation is the deity the supreme deity of our lord jesus christ you can't get to first base until you believe that and walk out so fine brother gary and i talking one day about something he said well i see that in us or something like that and i said brother here you can't do it you gotta see it in jesus first see we gotta see one true living god and jesus being that god all right but then because we when when we see who he is then he reveals where he's at right you realize the revelation brother callie of one god to you is god telling you where he's at i said it a moment ago you agreed with it in revelation this eternal word of god revealed how much more would you want than what something revealed to you see when it's revealed to you you don't have to worry about it amen right i know i should have done it on more and i just emphasized the point but i've looked for the lord to come every day i want him to come every day but when he revealed to me that we was missing on daniel 70 weeks the time of his coming that i began to preach that we could pass 77. you know i still that was 73 said before i was wanting to come but i was just saying it could be done but you know when he showed me that it could be done i should have said his stuff said the lord he can't come to life 77. that was the way i should have said it but i'm not that strong in what you think i still wanted it to come 72 73 74 75 i wanted him to come but i knew he didn't have to to fulfill the bible or the prophet's message so where the others were saying that he had to come i was saying he could be longer because he revealed it to me that he could pass there you ever got a revelation you stand by yourself you know and i'm honest and i'm not bragging just tell it like it is when i said that in 74 i stood by myself no and the richer them will hear that they know it's true but i didn't know them back then brother would've been them i got acquainted with them long and said before but had already preached it when i preached it to 57 i stood by myself then my wife began to see and talk to me about it and then some people begin to catch on and listen a little and i stood by myself you tell me i didn't come show me you tell me anybody else that said it that way i know that don't fit good in your pocket but chew on it i've got the tapes to prove to what i preached and that's bragging on jesus christ for what he shows me i can't hit this he chose me to bring it that wasn't what i wanted i wanted it to be through anybody else but when you get a revelation now what was we read there the other day when the bride of christ gets a revelation of who she is and what she's here for that she'll be a super race a super people why because nobody can't argue with it i told you about when i told the the dream of anna and forrest being born way before that you know that there's even born the brother motors have a little boy and we'd have a girl she'd be back you know maybe six seven eight years old whatever and that was about 72 and see everybody laughed at me said you're gonna miss the rapture because it had to be over in 73. i said i just tell him dream like a tree i saw a girl with a long black hair and a boy that brother mole was supposed to have a boy and was supposed to have a girl i just told her dream it's a dream but you see it to enterprise well it must have been something right well the reason is because it was the reason is because the bride ain't ready i mean that's the reason that's really got out of here you know what we ain't believing what god says about us we ain't believing what he says in his word when i read melancholy in malachi 4 told my wife that was in the badges where he joined the baptist church i said according to what the bible said there'd be two prophets coming for the end of the world i believe what it said but when brother mulch said malachi 4 i said what about malachi 3 who's that he explained john the baptist and brother brown's ministry and i said that settles that but you see i seemed by the bible that that was what it would take place the bible says there'd be pestilence like someone was talking the other day you know they said what kind of what kind of prayer could you pray is there any way that you could pray for the economy to straighten out now i want somebody to get in the bible with me i want you to talk in the bible with me i don't want your opinions pray for your economy to get straightened out right and that'll work that's right help you but you're praying contrary to the bible if you ask god to straighten out this economy and make it work you're praying contrary to the bible if you ask god to not bring pestilence and and things upon the earth because he said he was going to do it you can pray for god not to let it come on you and your family or whatever that's wonderful that's bible but you can't pray for god to change his mind about his word he's already said it's going to take place you can't pray for god to to straighten out all of this situation to the doctrines and the ideas of mankind because he said they would be here but you can pray for him to strengthen your and your ideals and that way the whole world can be falling apart and you can be flooding in money i mean that's just honestly that means because god can take care of you but you can't pray for those things to happen that's right lord we're going down here and pray for the empty hospital the prophet said it is not in the bible it won't work because god said there would be sicknesses and heartaches and troubles but you can pray for it to be straight in your life or your family or or whatever that's for somebody and god can honor that i hope you understand that don't blink off women when i said that while ago a lot of people do that when i say something their computer just shuts down and they don't even hear the rest of what i say you know the mind the computer but you see church we can let me ask you this way do you believe the bible says that there will be pestilence earthquakes great destruction come up on the earth do you believe that yes i am everybody believe that's what you mean now you shouldn't have done that i'm going to ask you another question do you believe the book of revelation shows you how perfect you are i got one yes and three or four nods not an amen okay now you see you believe this other part that's right but it brought it back personally see there's where we're missing the church we can read the bible and see all these things that take place and we know it well but when we read the bible it's telling us how perfect we are and that we're his body we're his people amen and then we down man well in a way i guess that could be right there ain't no in the way you're getting in the way when you're doing that when are we going to believe what god says come on music what are we going to believe we believe all the other we the people of this message puts her and come on now folks listen to what i'm saying they put their emphasis upon trying to prove brother branham as a prophet amen that's good right right but the same bible says you're perfect come on right the same bible tells you it shows you how pretty you are you're that beautiful that you are amen and what about it do we believe that go now if you believe one you gotta believe the other but if you deny one now quote the prophet you're denying the other if you deny that in god's eyes you're perfect then you deny the blood of jesus christ all right but brother dale i just got so many problems what's that got to do with it i got a lot of problems right i'm a human i've got a lot of problems i'm sorry she had hateful awareness but you know what my wife loves me she must she puts up with me so she's evidently looking over what i'm doing right you know that's where god is he ain't a dodio granddaddy he's a father let's say him again jesus is you see is is take away our little buddy is developing a coupling call nevermind about got it so we can sympathize with him and pray and believe you don't mean he's got to have it because the rest of us has got it we thank you lord jesus for touching our little body this little proof because the thing that is anybody else jesus why do you want him to come down here he's already down here you know brother rick they got him in jail it's not a sensible thing whether they trumped up the charges or whether they would guilty no problem you could face as much as 40 years because of the different accounts like four felonies or something like that five felonies he's one to get in ten years pray pray for his family his wife kids let's just pray let god come on the scene and work it out because he can work out things but you see we tried to get into that basis of trying to well he should have done this and he shouldn't have done that they say don't even pray in that way pray that god will come on the scene and touch the brother give our brother the words to be able to go to him and talk to him and pray that he can contact him or somebody that he can do but i've already told brother boyd this part he said something about it i'll be glad to go that maybe you know somebody from the church or minister could go and stand there with him at the the time of you know the um kind of in the sentence and i'll be glad to go and stand there and just say your honor i'm here to say he come to church for two years and i don't have any problems with him you know but i wouldn't lie and tell him that everything was perfect or whatever i just say your honor that's the way it stands you know because you know he needs help now let's pray to god father we just lay our hands upon our brother believing that we'll go this afternoon and he'll be able to contact her brother the lord just let him know we're all praying for him father whatever the thing or whatever it's done that's left in your hands to be able to work out something to where you can do it and we believe you lord that you'll manifest yourself because your little bride's asking for it father it's not that satan has come in to take out one of our members because he's not gonna be able to take him out if we just hold on to you but he's got a lot of problems a lot of trouble for we'd like to see those things straightened out see him in the right place and you're the only one that can do it so we just ask you father to be my brother here and be able to predict our lord in jesus name just go believe it and all things is for yourselves father we don't watch things the problems me our sister's asking for somebody else's family yourself is is is she's always prided herself is is nothing between my soul and my savior i want it to be the word i can always make contact but you know what i can't make contact a lot of times because i condemn my own self that's fine i need to straighten up no problem with that but you know a lot of times the devil condemns you when you ain't guilty you know but then you need help to be able to say get out of here you know get things going and you don't say them leave us alone amen you believe it and just remember this father we ask you to just bless us be with each one of us as we go our way leave a natural meal bring us back together in you lord forgive our sins lead us to guide us we believe all of these that came today is delivered healed set free because we believe your word truly we don't want nothing between our soul and our savior we love you father thank you man jesus night amen in the sky oh is there we go no is me two me
