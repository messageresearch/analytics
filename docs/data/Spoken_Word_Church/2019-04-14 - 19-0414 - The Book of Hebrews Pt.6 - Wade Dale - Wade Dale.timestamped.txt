[0:02] all right we are in the book of Hebrews
[0:06] and we are on chapter 5 we got down to
[0:11] verse Abel's gonna back up a little bit
[0:13] review for every high priest taken from
[0:19] among men is ordained for men and things
[0:22] pertaining to God that you may offer
[0:24] like different sacrifices percentage who
[0:27] can have compassion on the ignorant and
[0:29] on them that are out of the way when the
[0:32] himself is compassed with infirmity and
[0:34] by reason here of he ought as for the
[0:37] people so also for himself to offer
[0:40] percent so in other words a saying is a
[0:43] high priest was not sinless itself a
[0:47] high priest of normal human high priest
[0:50] has had sin problems - he wasn't he was
[0:55] only set aside to do a job but he still
[0:58] for the people and also for himself
[1:01] percent because when he made that
[1:03] offering in the in the temple in the
[1:06] Holy of Holies he made it for itself and
[1:08] the people he didn't make it for the
[1:10] people it made for itself but now what's
[1:13] he fixing to tell us though Christ
[1:14] didn't need that cos didn't didn't come
[1:17] to die for itself
[1:18] he came to die for us and by recent hear
[1:20] me all okay no man taketh dishonouring
[1:22] to himself but he that has called of God
[1:25] as was Aaron so also Christ glorified
[1:28] not himself to be made a high priest but
[1:32] that he said unto Him thou art my son
[1:34] today have I begotten thee so in other
[1:36] words he was the son of God he wasn't a
[1:38] high priest but he was not a high priest
[1:40] like we're high priest so what happened
[1:42] is is Paul's telling us in the Old
[1:45] Testament you had the high priest he was
[1:47] the only one I mean Christ was known
[1:49] earth God wouldn't not one here he was
[1:52] he was about the people but the high
[1:54] priest that was on the earth was doing
[1:56] the work but that high priest needed a
[1:58] sacrifice also so God sent his son to
[2:03] sacrifice as he except also in another
[2:06] place our two priests
[2:08] after the order of melchizedek now
[2:11] remember in the Old Testament there was
[2:14] it was called the I'm sorry the Aaron ik
[2:17] our errant priesthood which you had
[2:20] Levi's severed Sara Sara then that ended
[2:26] with Christ but now remember it was the
[2:30] order of Melchizedek we are under the
[2:36] order of Melchizedek look Melchizedek is
[2:38] not a priest Jesus Christ is our break
[2:41] I'm not rich okay Melchizedek was a form
[2:45] God took a form God took in the Old
[2:51] Testament but that's not our brother
[2:54] that's not our Savior what was inside
[2:58] that man was our Savior but Melchizedek
[3:00] the flesh man that talked to Abraham was
[3:03] a created body the flesh body then when
[3:07] God was finished talking to Abraham he
[3:09] just when he went into another dimension
[3:11] he just it would be fun to watch now
[3:15] when milk has a day when God Almighty
[3:17] steps in you know it's a faster
[3:19] dimension so when he stepped in that
[3:21] faster dimension you just saw a little
[3:23] dust flutter down to the ground
[3:24] I mean rarely that was his body brother
[3:27] brown said he just took 16 elements of
[3:29] Earth put it over his put it over to the
[3:32] aqua knee but when he went back into
[3:33] that seat couldn't take it wedding the
[3:35] only time you can take flex that's why
[3:37] Christ is our high priest he took his
[3:39] flesh into another dimension right he
[3:42] took his flesh into another dimension
[3:44] he's got a body changed and took that
[3:45] flesh and
[3:46] other dimension melchizedek did not he
[3:49] had to come back as Jesus Christ because
[3:53] Melchizedek wasn't a son the flesh
[3:56] Melchizedek was not son he was a created
[3:59] being absolutely
[4:02] they look like a 20 year old Jesus not
[4:05] Jesus do you feel them all up in the
[4:11] Anthony never would listen god never
[4:12] though never looked old so milk as a
[4:16] nickel didn't look oh no Cass I think
[4:19] was a young guy like 20 years old walked
[4:21] up to Abraham come listen think about
[4:25] this here's Abraham 99 years old all
[4:29] right
[4:29] Abraham's ninety-nine years old getting
[4:33] along in life there you know tell like
[4:35] all of us and then he meets Melchizedek
[4:39] that's going to give me my body change
[4:41] in milk air as it looks older than him
[4:42] you can't have that no a youthful milk
[4:46] as a big sense about the time of life
[4:49] you're gonna have a child and your
[4:51] body's gonna he didn't say that in the
[4:53] Bible but that's what happened his body
[4:55] was changed back
[4:56] so what a young man 20 year old young
[5:00] person so so yes Melchizedek was a young
[5:04] man and Jesus Christ only grew older in
[5:08] his human body because he was in this
[5:11] world all right he wasn't born in sin
[5:14] but he was born in a sinful world so he
[5:17] was 30 which he looked 50 because of his
[5:20] leaving look at brother branham he died
[5:22] at 56 years old I'm 59 he looked older
[5:25] than me when he was 56 if you look at
[5:27] the pictures of his hand
[5:29] it's like a wrinkled old
[5:30] oh man why because of the office that he
[5:33] carried right but we'll never see that
[5:36] again to them he's already standing in
[5:38] that condition now where he's already
[5:40] changed back so as Christ glorified not
[5:43] himself to be made of concrete but he
[5:46] that said unto Him thou art my son today
[5:48] have I begotten thee as he steps also in
[5:51] another place thou art a priest for ever
[5:53] after the order now not now Kevin II the
[5:56] order of Melchizedek but who in the days
[6:01] of his flesh when he had offered up
[6:03] prayers and supplications with strong
[6:05] crying and tears under him that was able
[6:07] to save him from death and was heard and
[6:10] that he feared though he were a son yet
[6:13] learned he obedience by the things which
[6:15] he suffered because remember Christ did
[6:19] not overcome at the cross no that was
[6:25] the act afterward the property God said
[6:27] he overcame in the Garden of Gethsemane
[6:29] you got to have a guest there any
[6:31] experience before you can have a
[6:33] crucifixion experience so in the Garden
[6:36] of Gethsemane is where he fought it out
[6:37] and won the battle the overcoming was
[6:40] done when he said father not my will but
[6:42] thy will be done in other words I'm
[6:43] going to what I need to do and I'm very
[6:47] willing to do it all right
[6:50] don't leave our son yet he learned to be
[6:52] about things with your suffering and
[6:53] being made perfect now look Christ did
[6:56] inside man didn't need to be made
[6:57] perfect you see this man here but this
[7:00] man when this man come into human flesh
[7:02] that body had to be perfected it was
[7:05] like we said he looked fifty years old
[7:07] but when he come out of that tomb on
[7:11] Easter morning he didn't look like he
[7:14] did it's obvious he didn't look like he
[7:17] did Mary Magdalene didn't know who he
[7:18] was
[7:18] the disciples had a problem with it
[7:21] because they didn't know when he was 20
[7:23] years old so it was having a problem
[7:24] with this guy that says but remember
[7:26] when she heard the voices divorcing
[7:27] never changed when she heard the voice
[7:29] when he said Mary she said Ravana our
[7:32] master and being made perfect he became
[7:36] the author of eternal salvation unto all
[7:39] them that obey Him yes we know there's
[7:43] any SS Christ but he was the author of
[7:45] eternal salvation now if he's the author
[7:46] of eternal salvation that has to be a
[7:48] recipient somebody read the book he's
[7:50] the author and finisher of our faith
[7:52] all right and like we've been saying
[7:54] he's the author of eternal salvation but
[7:57] once she received salvation once you
[7:59] received the new birth I was talking to
[8:03] a guy yesterday a beekeeper friend of
[8:05] mine and he's he's more maybe Church of
[8:08] God or maybe a little Pentecostal but he
[8:12] he has a problem with the once saved
[8:15] always safe so he and I got any pretty
[8:17] good discussion you know and he said
[8:19] talking about being different from being
[8:20] born-again and being saved he said
[8:22] they're definitely different I said yeah
[8:23] there's a difference but we were talking
[8:26] about if you take this yes once they'd
[8:30] always say eternal salvation all right
[8:34] do you receive the new birth in your
[8:36] soul you are eternal as God is that's
[8:38] what we're missing we're not getting
[8:41] that part fully is that we're already in
[8:44] eternal person all right we're gonna
[8:47] talk a little about that this afternoon
[8:48] because brother Graham talks about
[8:50] omnipotence do you ever look the word on
[8:52] the impotence up I mean if this means
[8:55] all-powerful brother Brown says when to
[8:58] omnipotence meet which is us and him so
[9:01] we'll talk about that but look being
[9:03] made perfect made us perfect all right
[9:06] called of God and high priest after the
[9:08] order of Melchizedek all right now you
[9:11] what Melchizedek anymore because
[9:12] remember
[9:13] they went away Jesus Christ came on the
[9:16] same there's no more Melchizedek all
[9:19] right but in the order that it came in
[9:22] the order that it came it was in the
[9:25] order of Melchizedek all right you know
[9:31] and you look at this title and I was
[9:33] trying to think of a way to say this but
[9:36] really Melchizedek doesn't have anything
[9:38] to do with us in that form he did come
[9:44] she had to go to Abraham because he
[9:46] couldn't be born of a virgin at that
[9:48] moment so he was a messenger he was one
[9:52] that brought a message to Abraham no we
[9:54] know that Melchizedek had to me neighbor
[9:57] him to change his body but Melchizedek
[10:01] the flesh ordered the flesh part of
[10:04] Melchizedek we were talking about before
[10:06] when they when that guy went back into
[10:09] that faster dimension it just dropped
[10:11] the elements back down on the earth
[10:12] and it became earth again there was no
[10:14] flesh went into another dimension with
[10:16] no cavity but with Jesus Christ being
[10:19] the author and finisher of our faith
[10:21] he took his flesh into a flat faster
[10:23] dimension showing that we can be
[10:26] glorified on this side and carry it
[10:28] somewhere else with us all right the
[10:31] call of God a high priest after the
[10:33] order of Melchizedek of whom we have
[10:36] many things to say and hard to be
[10:37] uttered there's listen there's a lot of
[10:39] people there's a lot of people there's a
[10:42] doctrine in them in the denominations
[10:44] that Melchizedek was just a priesthood
[10:46] it wasn't a person it's a Melchizedek
[10:49] Priesthood which is can they take that
[10:51] in the things in the Mormons or
[10:53] somewhere they take that Melchizedek
[10:54] Priesthood as their preachers I don't
[10:58] want to be that because that man was my
[11:01] Savior that man didn't say my soul okay
[11:06] that name person that order of
[11:08] Melchizedek now it brought us to because
[11:12] they have you come to Abraham Abraham
[11:13] was faith faithful he you had to have
[11:16] faith Abraham had to have faith that
[11:19] that man
[11:20] Cassady was something difficulty said my
[11:23] lord capital all right
[11:25] opponent we have many things to say and
[11:27] hard to be uttered seeing it's your
[11:29] dough of hearing because there probably
[11:30] was contention back then as there is now
[11:33] is this a real person or is this just an
[11:38] order it's just is it just a bunch of
[11:40] priests no it was a man okay the Bible
[11:44] says the man well kids and that thing
[11:45] will get into a Hebrew sticks and he
[11:47] doesn't leave this Paul doesn't leave
[11:49] this he continued on with this
[11:51] Melchizedek Priesthood of then we have
[11:54] many things that's saying hard to be
[11:55] under senior adult hearing for when for
[11:58] the time ye ought to be teachers you
[12:00] have need that one teach you again which
[12:02] be the first principles of the Oracles
[12:05] are what is that Oracle's it is sayings
[12:10] or teachings of God and I become such as
[12:14] have need of milk and not of strong meat
[12:16] so what's Paul saying he said your your
[12:19] your appear worried about if it was a
[12:22] man or worried about if it was a priest
[12:23] today that man already disappeared that
[12:26] man's gone that order of Melchizedek
[12:30] comes back into the Old Testament I want
[12:32] Jesus Christ Jesus Christ went to the
[12:34] cross for me male kinds of things did
[12:35] not that allure do you understand that
[12:38] that position that Christ took now we
[12:42] know what was inside of him did because
[12:44] it's not going to change it's the very
[12:45] same person all the way down that's why
[12:48] Jesus stood one day and said before
[12:49] Abraham was I am
[12:51] okay he was before Abraham what the
[12:54] inside person not the not the flesh milk
[12:56] as it ain't no not that person
[13:05] reverie wine for everyone that uses milk
[13:10] is unskillful nothing wrong with milk
[13:16] for takers of milk for everyone that are
[13:19] protectors of milk is unskillful in the
[13:21] word of righteousness right for he is a
[13:24] babe but strong means she worked it word
[13:28] strong means solid food belongs to them
[13:33] that are of full age or of maturity
[13:37] mature all right
[13:40] strong meat belong to them to Dermot or
[13:42] even those who by reason of use look by
[13:45] reason of use yeah it's like the lease
[13:48] of sin we need to practice when he'd
[13:49] come church need to read your Bible we
[13:52] need to pray and do the things of God
[13:56] have their senses exercised that's what
[14:00] you do every day see that we're trained
[14:03] to discern both good and evil so that's
[14:08] why you have to start out with milk
[14:11] which is fine the Paul's telling you you
[14:15] just use milk your unskillful your baby
[14:18] but strong meat belongs to them that are
[14:21] mature age even those who by reason of
[14:24] use have their senses exercised to
[14:27] discern both good and evil the only way
[14:30] you're going to discern good and evil
[14:32] that's what let me get this off you'll
[14:36] be skillful in the word because take a
[14:41] baby take a baby and give them 10th
[14:44] grade algebra or 12th grade algebra give
[14:46] it to a six-year-old child well they're
[14:49] just gonna sit there stare at the page
[14:51] right there go just look at the page
[14:53] there's this thing right there's there's
[14:55] numbers there and they've got a brain
[14:57] and they're human they're gonna they're
[14:59] gonna step down they're gonna look at it
[15:01] but give that person some time are some
[15:05] training or some teaching and then like
[15:08] the Anna now
[15:09] she's doing a couple of grades ahead in
[15:11] math you know why cuz she keeps
[15:12] practicing she like I said can't
[15:14] practices
[15:15] she keeps practicing her mouth she
[15:17] practices math all the time she'll sit
[15:18] there one day and you'll see a whole
[15:20] list of problems that she's done you
[15:22] know she'll she'll say here give me some
[15:24] problems today so why she's exercising
[15:28] she's exercising what her human brain
[15:33] which we should exercise our spirit
[15:37] realm to accept the things of God so the
[15:41] problem with this whole thing is is face
[15:43] I've come to the conclusion after all
[15:45] these years that we just don't have
[15:48] enough faith about what God is already
[15:51] saying okay we just don't have enough
[15:55] faith program said we don't have enough
[15:58] bang for a headache that was nothing 60
[15:59] something we should be look to the place
[16:03] not that everything is listen you know
[16:08] yeah everybody's got something today
[16:09] there's a list of something that's wrong
[16:11] with them
[16:12] right right so that doesn't mean that
[16:14] you're lost
[16:15] it just means we're living in the human
[16:17] body but we must overcome that in what
[16:20] go on to perfection being trained more
[16:24] and more being trained by the Word of
[16:29] God through good teachers as brother
[16:32] Louise was on that Wednesday night it
[16:34] has to be done even the order of
[16:37] Melchizedek was Melchizedek brought a
[16:39] message to Abraham okay he brought that
[16:42] message to Abraham now what did Abraham
[16:44] do brother branham said hey the reason
[16:47] God did these things for Abraham
[16:49] paraphrasing sorry I'm gonna paraphrase
[16:52] the quote is that he knew that Abraham
[16:55] would tell his next generation that
[16:56] Abraham was generation would tell the
[16:58] next generation and all the way down
[17:00] people he would tell him why tell them
[17:02] about why tell them about the good news
[17:04] the gospel what happened to it
[17:06] my if I said they're 99 years old and
[17:09] dead is a hammer and all of a sudden the
[17:11] next morning I wake up and I'm 20 years
[17:14] old again and I let go
[17:16] they're sterile 20 years old again he
[17:19] was happy about nothing so he told this
[17:24] next generation how that God had changed
[17:26] his body that God had brought him back I
[17:30] mean it's kind of obvious that Abraham
[17:34] and Isaac with Sarah right that when
[17:37] they got changed but remember several
[17:39] years later he married cateura and had
[17:42] seven more kids well obviously I was
[17:44] level was way older than them youngins
[17:46] learner so Abraham could say look when I
[17:49] got changed this is what happened and
[17:50] then mama died and then I had these
[17:52] other I had this other group of people I
[17:54] could tell my story to okay then i okay
[17:59] with it so now we were loading a look
[18:02] back you got to go back remember this
[18:03] the paragraph or the chapter doesn't end
[18:06] here strong meat belongs to them to
[18:08] their full age even those who by whom
[18:09] you who by means reason them use have
[18:13] their senses exercised to discern both
[18:16] good and evil
[18:17] keep reading therefore leaving the
[18:21] principles what does that principles
[18:24] mean Elementary discussion of okay it's
[18:29] alright to talk about one gun water
[18:31] baptism and and all these things but
[18:34] let's go on leaving the principles of
[18:38] the doctrine doctrine of Christ not
[18:40] doctrines doctrine of Christ let us go
[18:43] on unto what completion or maturity let
[18:48] us go on to maturity not laying again
[18:51] the foundation of repentance from dead
[18:53] works and of faith toward God you see
[18:56] that that's what I've been trying to
[18:57] tell you I don't have to have faith
[19:00] that's what I was telling that man
[19:01] yesterday I don't have you know because
[19:04] a lot of times especially in
[19:05] denominations they said well I hope we
[19:08] have this hope I have hope
[19:09] I said gene I don't have hope anymore I
[19:12] said I have an assured he I've know if
[19:15] I'm born again I know we'll see he
[19:17] couldn't understand that
[19:18] that was a little too close for him you
[19:20] know but I said look I said I don't have
[19:23] to have faith times I had to have faith
[19:25] when I got in the car because I didn't
[19:27] know if the car was gonna make it to
[19:28] your house I was only five miles from
[19:30] he's a beekeeper friendly man and I went
[19:32] over to get something from him I said
[19:34] gene I don't need faith to come visit
[19:37] you that faith is behind me that faith
[19:41] is in the journey when I'm standing here
[19:43] in front of you I don't have to have
[19:44] faith okay look I said I don't even have
[19:47] to have a whole
[19:48] I hope I'm gonna see I'm looking at you
[19:51] right so that's the same thing with here
[19:54] we can have a hope but I think what the
[19:57] prophet of God brought us was not a hope
[19:59] he took all that denominational worried
[20:02] about like I said before and I will say
[20:05] it again about they got to go through
[20:06] the tribulation that's something you go
[20:08] to bed any denominational Church ask
[20:11] them do I have to go through
[20:13] tribulations they will say yes you have
[20:15] to go if we have we're not know no
[20:17] imperfect no not one ain't got nothing
[20:21] you ain't perfect you ain't perfect you
[20:23] know I said wait a second
[20:24] that's all I understand what God said
[20:26] about me I just want to tell in genius
[20:30] today I said look if I'm a child of God
[20:31] how can I be good yeah I'm judged by
[20:35] Christ and if he's perfect now I'm
[20:37] perfect he kind of look you know maybe
[20:39] James are pretty he's any seventies and
[20:41] he's he's a good he's just he's a real
[20:44] good nominal Christian but he still has
[20:46] problems with some of their doctrines in
[20:48] you you talk to some of them and we
[20:50] never got into the tribulation part of
[20:52] it but they're saying you got to go
[20:54] through the tribulation to be purified
[20:55] when we as bride know that we're
[20:58] purified here and we don't have to do
[21:01] that right and that's one of the major
[21:04] doctrines of them versus what we have
[21:06] and I don't mean them I mean they dot
[21:08] way that's what they've been taught what
[21:11] they've been taught somebody came up
[21:12] with that God did something some man
[21:15] came up with that doctrine well we gotta
[21:17] go to the tree
[21:18] we're not perfect you know well I I
[21:24] don't see that but see look not laying
[21:28] again the foundation of repentance from
[21:30] dead works and of faith toward God in
[21:33] other words you shouldn't have to have
[21:36] faith that you're saved if you're born
[21:39] again rest in that put that away
[21:43] but if you're not you better worry about
[21:45] it but if you're born again just don't
[21:47] even worry about that foot back to the
[21:48] side you know what worry about going up
[21:51] worry about exercising what you've
[21:55] already got
[21:55] right of the doctrine of baptism and the
[21:59] laying on of hands would have been
[22:00] through all this all right I don't have
[22:04] to you know I don't have to go get
[22:05] rebaptised
[22:07] okay unless you've got a problem if you
[22:09] want a problem why do you have to go
[22:10] back and visit being rebaptised now the
[22:15] babies in Christ yes they need to be
[22:17] baptized but once you're baptized
[22:19] something Lord Jesus Christ and believe
[22:21] to the new birth you should not have to
[22:23] go back and have to do it again that's
[22:26] what he's saying here of the doctrine of
[22:27] Baptism and ableo avanza I'm sorry Paul
[22:31] tells us to leave that Paul says leave
[22:36] laying on of hands alright we've been
[22:38] through that knob you can believe that
[22:40] if you want to but it's just it's right
[22:41] there in the Bible if you don't believe
[22:43] the Bible then you're not believing
[22:45] because look and a resurrection of the
[22:49] Dead and of eternal judgment we must put
[22:52] all that away and this will we do if gun
[22:58] permit all right but now a week people
[23:02] in just I'm sorry we people have two
[23:04] hands they don't just the way they're
[23:07] sorry I told you what brother I've said
[23:09] about it right the Jewish tradition in
[23:13] whatever them wasn't a Gentile tradition
[23:15] if they do
[23:15] tradition brought in by the weakness of
[23:20] people
[23:28] for it is impossible I like that word
[23:32] pulses it's impossible for those who
[23:35] were once enlightened and have tasted of
[23:37] the heavenly gift and were made
[23:39] partakers of the Holy Ghost now that
[23:41] doesn't mean you give to Holy Ghost and
[23:43] if you were made for takers of the Holy
[23:46] Ghost and have tasted the good word of
[23:48] God and the powers of the world to come
[23:50] if they shall fall away to renew again
[23:52] into repentance in other words if you
[23:54] got if you were particular to the Holy
[23:55] Ghost if you have the Holy Ghost you're
[23:59] not going to do this if they shall fall
[24:02] away we see these people now this this
[24:05] you know priests like a house on fire on
[24:09] a windy day and I set one time to listen
[24:12] to - a brother preached and he did the
[24:15] best job I ever heard about the
[24:16] millennium and different things he was
[24:20] sleeping with a 14 year old girl life
[24:21] preaching that sermon so yeah but and
[24:28] that's the fact not a not a lot of hope
[24:31] so that's a bad but so remember if you
[24:36] shall fall away what he was doing he was
[24:38] preaching off of just pure intellect my
[24:42] brother Graham said it's really simple
[24:44] to read the Bible and say you need to be
[24:46] baptized name of Jesus Christ you know I
[24:47] meant just ability to read but if he had
[24:53] the Holy Ghost inside he wouldn't be
[24:55] doing that alright big difference in all
[24:57] that but it is impossible for those who
[24:59] were once enlightened and have tasted of
[25:01] the heavenly gift and were made
[25:02] protective of the Holy Ghost
[25:03] see if you remain particular to the Holy
[25:05] Ghost you're not going to fall away
[25:07] you might backslide you might do some
[25:10] things wrong but you're not going to go
[25:12] like that and go back that way if they
[25:16] shall fall away to renew them again unto
[25:17] repentance seeing they crucify to
[25:20] themselves the Son of God afresh and put
[25:22] him to an open shame in other words man
[25:28] helping are again how shameful would
[25:31] that be for the earth with drinketh in
[25:35] the rain that coming off the opponent
[25:37] and bringing
[25:37] urghhh meet for them by him in his dress
[25:39] receiveth blessing blessing from God but
[25:43] that which back thorn and brothers is
[25:45] rejected in nine the cursing who's ended
[25:47] to be burned but now remember they
[25:50] received the same rain they received the
[25:53] same nutrition the covers and the good
[25:58] grass you go look out your yard today
[26:00] and you're gonna see him bit Nettles
[26:03] you're gonna see thorns you're gonna see
[26:06] and you know what they're going how this
[26:09] rain is great cuz we're growing right
[26:11] out with your great little grass we're
[26:13] going around with it but remember they
[26:16] will show their character about what
[26:19] they grow not what comes up only in us
[26:24] candy takes a cooker burner and make
[26:27] them make a wheat plant out of all right
[26:29] but window cuckoo bird seeds in the
[26:32] ground is just don't make color works
[26:34] ain't gonna come up one day and all of a
[26:36] sudden you're gonna go oh I love this
[26:39] this grass you know no it's always going
[26:43] to because of our eye but remember when
[26:47] it starts up about this high and all
[26:49] this about the same green sprouts roots
[26:54] but when it starts bearing its fruit but
[26:59] that which bears thorns and briers is
[27:01] rejected at 9:00 the cursing whose end
[27:03] is to be burned but beloved we are
[27:07] persuaded better things of you all right
[27:11] in other words we complement of so Paul
[27:17] has a group of people that he's
[27:19] confident with that there is a group of
[27:21] people it's what I've been telling you
[27:22] there I'm confident there's a group of
[27:24] people gonna take a body change here
[27:28] today here somewhere on this earth maybe
[27:30] not in this building I'm not I'm not so
[27:33] I'm just saying somewhere there's got to
[27:35] be somebody who's gonna believe what's
[27:38] already been said yes but beloved we are
[27:41] persuaded better things of you and
[27:43] things that accompany salvation though
[27:46] we the speak so in other words you see
[27:49] this this
[27:50] company salvation the statue of a
[27:54] perfect man it accompanies your
[27:56] salvation all right because then you
[27:58] exercise these gifts and you become
[28:02] degree you can handle things of God
[28:10] power without character remember power
[28:13] without character
[28:14] it's the tannic because you use it wrong
[28:16] because you're born we're still with
[28:18] that sticky nature attached to you
[28:21] somewhat of this world and you'll use it
[28:25] wrong that's why Christ that overcomes
[28:28] the garden I mean after the garden he
[28:32] was being stripped naked beat put a
[28:33] crown of thorns and he never uttered the
[28:36] word hardly you know without say you
[28:39] know are you saying in other words and
[28:42] then here he was the mandate that raised
[28:45] Lazarus from the tomb and stopped the
[28:47] wind and raised Gary's his daughter and
[28:50] all these powerful things when he was
[28:52] stripped of all that yet he did not you
[28:57] know the song he could have called ten
[28:58] thousand angels well he could if he was
[28:59] God I didn't leave him the anointing
[29:01] left and God didn't leave him in still
[29:03] God yes alright
[29:05] but he'll did itself to what his job his
[29:08] job was was going across okay and that's
[29:12] our job our job to go to the cross but
[29:14] not to hang him up again like I said
[29:16] back up there them you can't keep
[29:18] putting him on the cross and the problem
[29:19] with most people is they can't get him
[29:21] off the cross and give him inside of you
[29:22] I love what that man said he was a
[29:26] denominational man he done a good job
[29:27] but he said where were we have a
[29:30] historical God we don't want a
[29:31] historical God we want a now God you
[29:34] know somebody now well maybe they're
[29:36] catching on a little bit well I know I'm
[29:39] saying cuz Christ died on the cross and
[29:41] I don't mean nothing I just
[29:42] you know you're just looking at a scene
[29:44] but when that man comes inside of you
[29:47] that's the difference for God is not
[29:50] unrighteous to forget your work and
[29:52] labor of love which he have showed
[29:56] toward his name in the 'i have
[29:58] ministered to the saints and do minister
[30:00] master you shoulda read that scripture
[30:06] but you're not thinking what the weeks
[30:08] are talking about means tonight there
[30:11] are a lot of good gospel ministers in
[30:15] this message seeing their people leave
[30:20] leave them leave them leave the
[30:22] congregation to stay home and watch tape
[30:25] or listening to tape from jefferson bill
[30:27] i'm gonna say it now i stone place is
[30:30] coming from and and here they are
[30:33] they're good ministers and now they're
[30:34] having to you know readjust or even get
[30:38] jobs because their congregation is one
[30:40] with nothing well you know what it's not
[30:41] him small yes those people fall and it's
[30:46] those people up north you don't ignore
[30:48] those people up north fall for dragging
[30:51] them away because it's not right it's
[30:53] wrong
[30:53] right yeah there's nothing right about
[30:56] it not one thing there's not one thing
[30:59] right about it or you turn the bible
[31:01] completely apart music but it is hurting
[31:05] and that's where you can feel the hurt
[31:07] only tonight you can feel the hurt
[31:09] knowing somebody standing there with a
[31:10] congregation of 50 or 75 people and
[31:13] you're preaching the way and all of a
[31:14] sudden there's 20 you wonder where they
[31:18] went what did they go to another church
[31:20] now they're saying the home listening to
[31:25] yep
[31:28] Bob talks about the king of the north
[31:35] but listen I'm telling you that's the
[31:37] problem though it's wrong what's wrong
[31:38] is wrong you need to call it wrong it's
[31:40] wrong and you know what it is it's back
[31:44] to right over here mature mature Bragg
[31:53] will never fall for that never I'm not
[31:57] saying that these people are not born
[31:59] again but they're just babies right but
[32:03] now I'm telling you with the Holy Ghost
[32:04] inside of you how's it going to drawing
[32:06] you away from what the Bible says I
[32:09] can't do it that's what I mean there's a
[32:10] lot of people in this message that are
[32:12] not warning in that thought they were
[32:13] because of thinking that they did the
[32:16] hair and the dress and the do's and the
[32:17] don'ts and the ten commandments and all
[32:19] that and you know right but people and
[32:23] it may happen in this church but I don't
[32:24] think you well we've been established
[32:26] enough to know the brother Dale told us
[32:30] to get born again and getting born again
[32:32] sure helps a lot it's everything because
[32:37] brother Branham said remember the Bible
[32:40] says it will deceive the very elect if
[32:42] it were possible brother Brown said you
[32:45] can't deceive the elect but frankly if
[32:48] you'll only time I think he ever used
[32:50] the word frankly put frankly in your in
[32:52] your table and he says he one time in
[32:56] the church days book he says but frankly
[32:58] God will have to cut the work short
[32:59] because you get her confused well that's
[33:00] what's happening now it's the confusion
[33:03] even though they say I'm right and I'm
[33:05] wrong or whatever you want to say
[33:07] there's a confusion there and we know
[33:09] who it is God is not the author of
[33:12] confusion right so we know I see other
[33:15] guys all right if I okay with that
[33:19] family I'm saying well I don't have to
[33:21] eat any what's gonna happen if they
[33:24] start signs and wonders somewhere I
[33:29] still ain't gonna believe because
[33:31] they're not doing it right to start with
[33:33] their foundation is not
[33:34] right go back to the foundation all
[33:38] right
[33:39] you know what I'm not doing like
[33:41] somebody in the message called him
[33:42] Antichrist I'm not gonna do that at the
[33:46] moment they look a little anti word a
[33:49] lot of anti word but you can come back I
[33:53] mean you can use that's not up that's
[33:56] not a sin unto death unless you carry it
[33:58] onto them you know so you understand
[34:01] what I'm saying this I don't praying
[34:03] that God will turn Abel because what
[34:05] about a great thing if he turn it all
[34:06] back around Brooke should be what a
[34:08] great thing it would be I mean it would
[34:10] be powerful to low to use the resources
[34:15] that they have for for the right thing
[34:18] but people get trapped they're babies
[34:22] this seat feels good sounds good you
[34:24] don't smell anything
[34:25] mm-hmm and I'll bet you I don't say that
[34:28] I'll promise you Paul had to deal with
[34:30] stuff like that
[34:32] I bet you they did think Paul was God at
[34:35] one time but all the miracles and things
[34:37] that he'd done but you don't read it in
[34:38] the Bible because it's not read but
[34:41] there had to be some because even Paul
[34:43] says you know he said you've got some of
[34:44] Cephas and some of this and he said some
[34:47] of Paul and some of this one he said
[34:49] Apollo's water or Paul water and Apollo
[34:52] whatever yeah but you understand he
[34:54] named names about people that were in
[34:56] the congregation they were saying well
[34:57] Paul you know the same way with brother
[35:01] branham I would assume if you were
[35:04] around that man and he could tell you
[35:05] what you're gonna do in 15 minutes and
[35:08] how many fish you're gonna catch the
[35:11] next day and the day after you remember
[35:14] that I read that the other day where
[35:15] brother Brown told that man he was
[35:18] trying to convert this guy and his
[35:20] grandpa comes in so I don't believe know
[35:23] that we're brother Ron said okay you
[35:24] tell your grandfather we're gonna catch
[35:25] one fish tomorrow I'm gonna catch 6 the
[35:29] next day and the next day they're not
[35:31] gonna catch anything we're not gonna
[35:33] catch anything and and the you know the
[35:36] grandfather's life you know happened
[35:39] exactly
[35:39] they said they'd fish I mean the hardest
[35:42] thing a thing you cannot do God
[35:46] God brother Ralph saw that Division will
[35:48] then he said at the end the grandpa just
[35:51] softened up and said well there must be
[35:53] something to this we converted even took
[35:55] running form or some people need them
[35:58] that's right it was brother woods and
[36:00] his granddaddy your brother woods in his
[36:01] day you wanted the whole family right
[36:03] yeah that's what it was you're right
[36:05] no television took a bishop and said I'm
[36:10] gonna catch one fish today and it's
[36:12] going to be the biggest one of the whole
[36:14] trail but I'm going to catch six
[36:15] tomorrow y'all that Widow kicks in like
[36:17] and they stay well now that's three days
[36:18] out and I mean you're going now I put
[36:20] the biggest worm and put the biggest
[36:22] Lord I'll guarantee they tried to prove
[36:25] me wrong I would have taken I wouldn't
[36:29] say you know but you know what you can't
[36:31] do God have a purpose in that brother
[36:34] Brown wasn't showing off he was showing
[36:37] those people that what he was preaching
[36:38] was the truth that's the pay of the hook
[36:41] they didn't catch them fish the problem
[36:43] is they didn't see the allegory to that
[36:46] there was no fish caught the last day
[36:48] but there was some eternal fish that
[36:50] were caught that day the whole with him
[36:53] he was caught that day by the Prophet
[36:56] and same thing with you and I we don't
[36:58] have to be prophets but things in our
[37:00] life we can show people we can be
[37:02] examples of a Christianity that will
[37:06] bring somebody in you don't even know
[37:07] that you do it you know for God it's not
[37:10] righteous to forget your work and labor
[37:11] that's what we're talking about here
[37:13] couple of which he have showed toward
[37:15] his name and that you have ministered to
[37:17] the Saints and do minister and we desire
[37:20] that every one of you to show the same
[37:23] diligence till the full of chefs are
[37:24] hoping them go preach go go spread the
[37:29] gospel we desire that every one of you
[37:31] do show the same diligence to the
[37:34] fullest shots of hope unto the end that
[37:37] you be not slothful
[37:39] like a same we do not you know I'm sorry
[37:42] I said lazy they're just people are lazy
[37:45] to not get a to what are you gonna
[37:47] overcome if you sit at home with coffee
[37:49] in your slippers on and and watch or
[37:53] listen to a sermon or even watch this
[37:56] this church when the doors are opening
[37:58] you're healthy to get here like I said
[38:01] the other night about brother Colley
[38:02] he's in his late 70s and that Guildford
[38:04] they many services he's missed in the
[38:06] years I'm talking about
[38:07] you couldn't put him on that calendar
[38:10] how many he has missed in 50 years of
[38:13] coming here since 1974 I think again and
[38:18] you know why he told me the other day he
[38:19] said it's getting hard but you know what
[38:22] he never shut up quick hey I'm coming
[38:27] look sister Trudy the same way she
[38:28] traveled all the four hours both ways to
[38:32] come to church all those years good okay
[38:35] there's a reward for that yes ma'am
[38:38] there's never a reward for that yeah
[38:39] that she be not slothful which that
[38:42] would be lazy are sluggish sluggards but
[38:46] followers of them who through faith and
[38:48] patience inherit the promises of them
[38:51] that preach the gospel
[38:52] Colette's where you going to get your
[38:54] food from you're going to get it from
[38:55] from mama Eagle that choose the food up
[38:58] for you and give it to you all right
[39:00] because remember we're equals Eagles
[39:03] don't ever have Milty always ate they
[39:04] start off eating meat for when God made
[39:11] promised to Abraham because he could
[39:13] swear my by no grapes were by himself
[39:15] when he made his own nose in the only
[39:16] he's for myself see we're not to swear
[39:20] to God but God can swear by itself
[39:22] because there's nobody else to swear by
[39:23] he swears by his own self because you
[39:26] know what if he made peace wears a
[39:28] sweater it's not just you know he said I
[39:32] swear I'm on GoDaddy BAM I swear I'm
[39:35] going to you do that one time you car
[39:39] breakdown you you you know the bridge
[39:42] will fall down between me and Danny but
[39:44] now God don't do that when he swears
[39:45] it's already done when he swears he
[39:49] swears by self there's no greater he
[39:52] swears myself saying that wouldn t /
[39:55] surely blessed surely we'll stop right
[39:57] here won't stop 1:15 I want to get to
[40:02] that one because that's in Mackay surely
[40:04] blessing I will bless today and
[40:05] supplying I will multiply they'd not
[40:07] physically spiritually we are now under
[40:12] the spiritual multiplication of the
[40:14] spoken word right and so after he had
[40:18] patiently endured he obtained the
[40:21] promise to Abraham so the Bible says in
[40:25] Matthew 24 right at the end of the
[40:29] lessons of the fifth seal we read it the
[40:31] other day long time ago now then those
[40:35] who endure to the end and that's the
[40:38] only way you're gonna know that you got
[40:39] the goods if you endure to the Union
[40:41] because if you don't you're gonna fall
[40:42] off you're gonna do this one to that all
[40:44] right for me anybody swear by the
[40:46] greater and an oath of confirmation is
[40:48] to them to end will stop their stuff at
[40:50] 15 all right let's go now next Sunday
