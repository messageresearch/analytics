[23:14] day of 70 weeks we're going to talk
[23:16] about the seals so let's bow our heads
[23:19] the only father we pray today Lord that
[23:21] you wouldn't
[23:23] Jesus not be a bystander but Lord be an
[23:26] active participant in this service
[23:28] we know you've been with us in the songs
[23:31] and the Praises Lord and the prayers
[23:34] the offering now I pray that you'll be
[23:36] with us Lord here as we
[23:38] try Lord to present your word to the
[23:40] people
[23:42] father you said you would be with us you
[23:44] wouldn't leave us or forsake us
[23:46] all the things that are going on Lord in
[23:48] all of our Lives we
[23:50] we lord we continue to give you praise
[23:52] Lord that you've kept us Lord from from
[23:55] things and of life and you've helped us
[23:58] Lord
[23:59] and we pray that you'd help us more now
[24:01] Lord as the day approaches father that
[24:03] Satan's return his best to
[24:06] cut us off but Lord you said that no
[24:08] there's no weapon formed
[24:10] that will stand against this little
[24:12] bride
[24:13] Lord I pray that you come on the scene
[24:15] father be with a sick you said you sent
[24:17] the word and healed them and delivered
[24:18] them from their destruction as the word
[24:20] Goes Forth father I pray that she would
[24:22] just Lord give us the eye sound of the
[24:24] Holy Spirit and Lord give us ears to
[24:26] hear what the spirit says to the
[24:28] churches father forgive us of our sins
[24:30] bless this day continue to be with us be
[24:32] with the bride around the world we were
[24:34] the missionaries on the foreign field
[24:35] Lord give them fruit for their labor or
[24:38] just give us our daily bread today we
[24:39] ask these things in Jesus name
[24:41] amen so we're running on one wheel so we
[24:44] got the we got the uh
[24:47] one computer working our brothers in the
[24:49] back so they're uh they do a wonderful
[24:52] job a lot of stuff y'all don't see that
[24:54] they take care of before all this has
[24:55] been taking place
[24:57] out here so uh remember them in your
[25:00] prayers too but Daniel 9
[25:02] verse 24.
[25:05] we're going to continue on the study of
[25:06] the six-fold purpose but we're going to
[25:08] try to like we said last Sunday is bring
[25:11] in the natural part of the seals because
[25:14] you know we get the spiritual part and
[25:16] and brother Dale was speaking on that
[25:18] this morning and did you know of course
[25:19] he always does a wonderful job but that
[25:21] just kind of fits right in if you'll
[25:22] keep your mind on that then you'll be
[25:25] able to maybe learn a little more about
[25:29] the natural part of the seals being open
[25:31] because we don't see the natural part of
[25:33] the seals we see the spiritual part the
[25:36] natural part goes to the Jews so as
[25:39] we're standing on a six-fold purpose
[25:40] let's read Daniel 9 24. the 70 weeks are
[25:44] determined upon thy City and upon thy
[25:46] holy and upon thy people
[25:48] and upon thy Holy City to do these six
[25:51] things right to finish the transgression
[25:53] to make an end of sins to make
[25:55] reconciliation for iniquity bring in
[25:57] Everlasting righteousness seal of
[26:00] division and prophecy and to anoint the
[26:02] most holy now let's go to Revelations
[26:04] 11.
[26:06] read verse 1 there that is where the
[26:09] good profits are coming into Israel
[26:12] we've all ready for those of you that
[26:14] are not they have not been here or have
[26:16] been here a few times before not the
[26:19] background so much but we in this church
[26:22] believe that Daniel 70 weeks that the
[26:24] prophet preached them correctly
[26:26] he preached them right the first time he
[26:29] does not need someone to come back and
[26:31] correct him
[26:32] if he needed correction God corrected
[26:34] him right so we believe that today of 70
[26:37] weeks was preached by our prophet and
[26:39] then it was then it was Vindicated and
[26:42] then it was revealed
[26:45] to you and I anything the prophet
[26:47] preached has got is is a revelation to
[26:50] you and I we'll take it as that right
[26:51] all right now remember Jesus said eat my
[26:55] flesh and drink my blood that's a quote
[26:58] you take that quote out of context you
[27:00] make him a vampire right right but if
[27:02] you take that quote in context he's
[27:04] telling us what to do as far as the
[27:06] communion goes all right so that's the
[27:08] same way with brother Branham we see
[27:10] that he brought and and revealed to us
[27:13] the love letter
[27:14] and showing that these two prophets
[27:16] would come after we leave but it does
[27:19] have something to do with us because it
[27:21] is the Redemption of Israel we must see
[27:24] our Redemption
[27:27] because like I told you last Sunday what
[27:29] we received here is a revelation we have
[27:32] to hand that child
[27:34] right
[27:37] handed that child to Naomi not a
[27:40] different child the child that they
[27:42] conceived and they birthed they handed
[27:46] it to Naomi which was the type of us
[27:48] handing Jesus Christ back to Israel so
[27:50] we can't hand them a trinity we can't
[27:52] hand them a false Doctrine we can't hand
[27:54] it hand them that brother Brandon was
[27:56] wrong and that the the words wrong here
[27:59] and there we can't handle that we got to
[28:00] hand them the perfect word of God for
[28:02] God to come into these two prophets and
[28:05] reveal reveal what's already been
[28:08] revealed to us that's right see we're
[28:10] the bride they're servants right
[28:14] I'm gonna I'm gonna converse with my
[28:16] wife first
[28:17] tell her the secret things that's right
[28:19] then if we decide to give it to somebody
[28:21] else we can but if not it's between us
[28:23] that's right that's what God did he
[28:24] revealed his secrets to his bride and
[28:27] then we take what we have and we hand it
[28:29] to Israel
[28:31] so they can be redeemed also so
[28:33] Revelations 11 1-6 and there was giving
[28:36] me a read I want you to watch this
[28:39] because we usually skip down to verse
[28:41] three to talk about the two witnesses
[28:44] but remember
[28:45] in our study of Daniel 70 weeks in the
[28:49] six-fold purpose
[28:51] remember that six things has to happen
[28:54] to the people and the what
[28:57] City amen listen to this and that was
[29:00] giving me a read like I can do a rod and
[29:02] the angel stood saying rise and measure
[29:04] the temple of God
[29:07] now we know where the temple of God
[29:10] but there's going to be a natural temple
[29:12] built in Jerusalem the Millennium Temple
[29:14] all right all right so this is the
[29:16] twofold manner here a twofold purpose
[29:19] rise and measure the temple of God and
[29:22] the Altar and them that worship therein
[29:24] but the court which is without the
[29:26] temple leave out
[29:28] and measure it not
[29:31] remember we get we don't get time times
[29:34] and the dividing of times
[29:36] he raises his hand in this fraternity
[29:39] right right we're gentiles but the court
[29:42] which is without the temple leave out
[29:44] and measure it not right
[29:46] right because there's no special time
[29:47] for the Gentiles there is a special time
[29:49] for Israel though
[29:51] what is given unto the Gentiles what the
[29:54] outer core right the outer Court you
[29:57] there was a court that you could walk in
[29:58] as a gentile but watch this and the holy
[30:02] city shall they tread Under Foot 40 and
[30:06] two months who the Gentiles so that
[30:09] Temple cannot be restored
[30:11] during the 42 months that these two
[30:14] prophets are going to preach exactly so
[30:15] there must be a time
[30:18] for the holy heavy to be restored right
[30:21] and redeem all right and I will give
[30:24] power to my two witnesses and they shall
[30:26] prophesy a thousand two hundred and
[30:27] three score days
[30:28] clothing sackcloths these are the two
[30:30] olive trees and two candlesticks
[30:32] standing before the god of the earth and
[30:34] if any man will hurt them fire
[30:35] proceedeth out of their mouth now that's
[30:37] not literal fire it's what they're words
[30:39] right and devours their enemy and if any
[30:42] man will hurt them he must die must be
[30:44] in this manner be killed these have
[30:47] power to shut heaven and Reign not in
[30:49] the days of their prophecy and have
[30:50] power over Waters to turn into blood and
[30:52] to Smite the Earth with all plagues as
[30:55] often as they will and you may be seated
[30:56] in the Lord at his Blessing for the
[30:58] reading of the word now just in the
[31:00] background we want to show
[31:03] for those of you that have not been here
[31:05] are are coming a little bit later
[31:08] we're looking now at the
[31:11] part of the Daniel 70 weeks chart that
[31:14] brother Branham Drew
[31:16] and we're looking at the last week so
[31:18] we're that's what we're dealing with is
[31:20] the six-fold purpose is for the
[31:23] Redemption of Israel correct
[31:25] amen amen amen Mr Michelle I get the
[31:27] Sleepy crowd so I get to walk out here
[31:29] and wake them up see what I mean
[31:32] don't you need to go sleep
[31:35] all right
[31:38] six-fold purpose though finishes
[31:41] Israel's Redemption
[31:43] right right
[31:44] them and the City
[31:46] correct all right six seals finishes our
[31:49] Redemption so there's a parallel there
[31:51] the library Adele said this morning we
[31:55] get the spiritual part
[31:58] we get the spiritual part of Revelation
[32:00] 6 1 through 19. we're not here doing
[32:03] that time
[32:05] we're not here we're going 401 we're
[32:07] caught up into heaven correct right
[32:08] right all right so now
[32:12] message to the 144 000 will last how
[32:16] long
[32:17] the Bible said
[32:19] 1260 days
[32:21] which is a 30-day prophetic calendar 30
[32:25] days in a month that's exactly three and
[32:27] a half years right okay
[32:30] so now those two profits are going to
[32:33] preach and prophesy for 1260 days
[32:36] according to Revelations 11 3 that we
[32:39] just read right
[32:40] so
[32:42] and then during that time Israel is
[32:44] going to receive
[32:47] the Messiah message that Jesus preached
[32:50] three and a half years when he was here
[32:52] right
[32:53] Jesus preached three and a half years
[32:55] here now he's going to preach three and
[32:58] a half years over here through to
[33:00] profits right all right so we see that I
[33:04] mean we've already been through that
[33:05] this is just the background but I wanted
[33:07] to show you like we were talking about
[33:08] last week how that comes to the seals
[33:13] because it's got to show us
[33:16] that in this 1260 days that all these
[33:20] things happen
[33:21] the seals the plagues the vows the
[33:24] trumpets anything from Revelation 6 1 to
[33:26] Revelations 19 21 when we come back with
[33:29] Jesus into the Millennium has to do with
[33:33] the Jews
[33:34] right right nothing to do with us at all
[33:38] right except if we don't get the
[33:40] spiritual revelation of it no they're
[33:43] not going to get the natural part of it
[33:45] right remember God does it he reveals it
[33:48] and then he makes it manifest right
[33:49] right so he does it reveals it makes it
[33:52] manifest so he does it reveals it to us
[33:55] then he makes it manifest to Israel
[33:57] through two prophets all right but you
[34:00] and I have got to see the breaking of
[34:02] that seal yes are the books still closed
[34:05] right and if the book's still closed
[34:07] they can't get the open book all right
[34:09] because Revelation 6 1 does revelation
[34:12] 19 is what's going to happen between
[34:16] that 1260 days that these two prophets
[34:19] are going to preach right
[34:23] you don't agree with it I'll you'll have
[34:26] to disagree with the prophet but I'm
[34:27] going to read quote with you in just a
[34:28] second
[34:29] to back that up the revelations
[34:32] 19
[34:37] and throw it away
[34:39] like I said last Sunday
[34:42] if six one to 19 is not to us and we
[34:44] don't have anything to do with it then
[34:45] just taking care of it out of your book
[34:46] throw it away
[34:48] but now you got to deal with Revelations
[34:49] 22 where it says if you take anything
[34:52] out of the book your name's took out of
[34:55] the book all right so be careful when
[34:57] you take something out of the Bible
[34:59] now let's go to the quote number a now
[35:02] let's read it
[35:07] this is Gable's instruction to Daniel
[35:09] now this is Brother Brown he's preaching
[35:10] the 70-week series he's in the
[35:13] instructions to Daniel Revelation 6 1 to
[35:15] Revelations 19 21 it's connected with
[35:18] the 70 of weeks therefore we must stop
[35:21] and explain before we go further
[35:23] that's what we're doing now we must stop
[35:25] and explain why these 70 weights because
[35:27] if you don't you'll miss the sales
[35:29] you'll miss the trumpets you'll miss the
[35:31] vowels the plagues three unclean spirits
[35:33] like frogs that's all in six one to
[35:35] nineteen all right those three woes the
[35:38] casting out of the Red Devil the woman
[35:39] in the sun you'll miss it all if you
[35:41] don't because it takes place right here
[35:43] in this 70th week that's where it takes
[35:46] place everybody see that say Amen all
[35:49] right the Revelation 6 1 to 1921 is to
[35:52] the Jews but it does have a spiritual
[35:56] meaning to us
[35:58] but it's going to be a natural happening
[36:00] to the Jews all right everybody got that
[36:03] same man all right number B
[36:06] this is the six-fold purpose what we're
[36:09] talking about now what is it his people
[36:11] had just crowned him King of Kings now
[36:14] to save time that was the last one which
[36:18] is anoint the most holy this is what he
[36:20] was talking about when he was talking
[36:22] about the bride coming back and
[36:24] anointing the temple right here and then
[36:27] paragraph 134 he starts with this
[36:30] what is it his people had just crowned
[36:32] him king of kings and Lord of lords
[36:33] coming back to his holy Temple Anointed
[36:36] with the presence of God to living Reign
[36:38] through the Millennium with his church
[36:40] because remember I after the two
[36:42] prophets prophesied battle of Armageddon
[36:44] the holy cities to needs to be built and
[36:46] then we're supposed to come back in in
[36:48] the Millennium in Revelations 19 21 is
[36:51] that correct
[36:52] right all right so now the appearing
[36:54] with the mighty king to take her place
[36:56] at his side the new Royal anointed
[36:58] Temple so we must be there with her with
[37:01] him her right that's us okay all right
[37:05] now the sixth full purpose of Revelation
[37:08] 6 1 to Revelations 19 21 is fulfilled
[37:12] so Revelation 6 1 to Revelations 19 21
[37:15] has to be fulfilled in that last part of
[37:19] the 70th week of Daniel now in closing
[37:22] the seven seal seven trumpets seven
[37:24] files three woes woman in the sun
[37:26] casting out of the devil the red dragon
[37:27] comes between these times during the
[37:30] Great Tribulation period don't forget it
[37:33] all these things take place during this
[37:35] time but here is the six-fold purpose of
[37:39] his coming who's coming Christ amen what
[37:42] is the two prophets preach Christ
[37:45] right so much for where they say where
[37:47] did you get those scars that's right man
[37:49] he doesn't physically come but he
[37:51] doesn't physically come here either
[37:53] but we get a body change and we get took
[37:56] out of here just by the revelation of
[37:58] him being so present Among Us that
[38:00] brother Khali is God made manifest in
[38:03] another form we are the Bride made
[38:06] manifest where God made manifest if
[38:08] we're in The Bride of Jesus Christ we
[38:09] are God not a second person amen that's
[38:12] right amen if we're not we're anti right
[38:15] right we're Antichrist if we're not
[38:18] Christ make manifest in another form but
[38:20] here's the sixthful purpose of his
[38:22] coming what to them
[38:24] because he promised he'd never forget
[38:26] Israel that's right even though he put
[38:29] him away in adultery he said I'll never
[38:30] forget them because they are to come in
[38:33] as servants all right but here's the
[38:36] sixthful purpose of his coming do you
[38:37] believe it what a glorious time lays in
[38:39] store for those who love the Lord I tell
[38:41] you friends we can't afford to miss that
[38:43] don't miss that whatever you do be sure
[38:46] it's like Daddy said today don't miss
[38:48] the Rapture because it's the tribulation
[38:51] period
[38:52] if you miss it right
[38:54] right and as much as we know about the
[38:56] message it's going to be hell
[38:59] if we miss it so now who will these two
[39:01] prophets be we know it's Moses and
[39:03] Elijah and we know they're coming to
[39:06] bring a message
[39:07] but now we're going to see and bring up
[39:09] number one
[39:11] just kind of lay a little background
[39:13] here and then we're going to get into
[39:14] the scripture and talk about the seals
[39:16] watch these two prophets this is in the
[39:18] 70th week of Daniel watch these two
[39:20] prophets going to do when they come
[39:22] so in other words
[39:24] the Raptors already taking place we're
[39:26] gone right we don't go through the
[39:28] defibrillation period right man we don't
[39:30] see the amount of sin sitting in the
[39:31] temple of God we don't see the seal open
[39:34] in its natural form right
[39:36] right we get a revelation of it remember
[39:39] what brother Dale said the seal does
[39:41] what shows what was
[39:43] what is and what is to come right so we
[39:46] can see what is to come this is what is
[39:48] to come this is the prophecy that we can
[39:50] see that brother Brown came to bring us
[39:53] the open book so that we can read it not
[39:55] that he read it for us right
[39:59] I didn't graduate high school because my
[40:02] teacher could read that's right right
[40:04] right amen I graduated high school
[40:06] because I learned how to read all right
[40:10] watch these two prophets going to do
[40:12] when they come this Beast this Prince
[40:13] that shall scatter the power of the Holy
[40:15] people what will you do he'll break his
[40:18] Covenant with him after three and a half
[40:19] years he'll ask them now people think
[40:22] that's communism that's just because
[40:24] you're the spirit of God hasn't dealt
[40:25] with you yet it's not communism it's
[40:28] what
[40:29] religion Protestants and Catholics all
[40:32] right the Bible said it would be so
[40:34] close it would deceive the very elected
[40:36] possible Jesus said sit so so we're in
[40:39] the last one now these two prophets what
[40:41] will they do it's more than Elijah
[40:43] they'll rise on the Saints they'll tell
[40:45] those Jews their mistake
[40:48] to what they're going to tell them
[40:50] you're wrong
[40:51] they're going to establish Temple
[40:52] worship the Beast is going to sign a
[40:54] pact with them and let them do their own
[40:56] sacrifices and all that stuff and then
[40:58] these 144 000 these two prophets they're
[41:01] going to raise up and say hey
[41:03] you missed it you've made a mistake
[41:06] they'll tell those Jews they're mistaken
[41:08] out of that Jewish Bunch that there's
[41:10] now to be 144 000 so it's not all Israel
[41:13] going to be saved amen there's only 144
[41:16] 000. all right God will call with these
[41:19] prophets what is it the spirit of Elijah
[41:21] off of this Gentile church now who's he
[41:24] talking about us all right off of this
[41:27] Gentile church will just continue right
[41:29] on into that Jewish Church
[41:32] go right on in and call Moses with him
[41:35] Hallelujah
[41:36] you see it and he'll preach the same
[41:38] message of Pentecost to those Jews that
[41:41] they rejected the Messiah amen you see
[41:43] it it will be the same Pentecostal
[41:45] message that these Jews will preach
[41:47] right over
[41:48] to them now we're going to get into that
[41:50] stop this is hanging we're going to get
[41:51] into that because I want to if we can
[41:53] get through the seals today I want to go
[41:55] into the trumpets because the trumpets
[41:57] brings a little different
[41:59] it's not different but it is a little
[42:01] bit different angle
[42:03] of because the Jews missed the Feast of
[42:06] Pentecost
[42:09] right they missed the piece of Pentecost
[42:11] all right so just keep that in your mind
[42:13] for a minute because it'll be the same
[42:14] Pentecostal message they're not going to
[42:16] preach something different than Paul
[42:17] said I mean Peter stood up on in the
[42:19] book of Acts
[42:21] in Acts 1 Acts 2 1
[42:24] he comes up and in Acts 2 38 Peter gets
[42:27] up and starts preaching him a message
[42:28] what is a Pentecostal message
[42:30] action 38. it's the same Pentecostal
[42:33] message that these years will preach
[42:35] right over to them and they'll hate
[42:36] those Jews so badly till they'll kill
[42:38] them and we're hated by All Nations and
[42:41] in the midst of the week because it had
[42:43] raised up a great hundred and forty four
[42:45] thousand now here's one that I didn't
[42:46] bring last Sunday
[42:47] a great powerful 144 000 not just two
[42:50] profits are great
[42:53] right not just one profit in the end
[42:55] time was great
[42:56] right right there's the people raised up
[42:59] underneath that message took the voice
[43:02] in the days of The Voice
[43:05] we're taking the message and becoming a
[43:07] powerful
[43:09] one without number they are a powerful
[43:11] 144 000. they had the Holy Ghost and
[43:13] brother you talk about doing Miracles
[43:15] they did them they stopped the heavens
[43:16] it didn't rain the days of their
[43:17] prophecy spoke the Earth with plagues as
[43:20] often they wanted to they give plagues
[43:21] and everything else they'll give them
[43:22] Romans the hard way to go but finally
[43:24] they'll be killed now that'll be over
[43:26] after the 1260 days our God is a
[43:29] terrible God when he's anger but
[43:30] remember that's over in the 70th week in
[43:32] the church in glory the wedding supper
[43:34] going on yes
[43:36] and now notice that's where we've seen
[43:38] her coming back to the millennial Temple
[43:39] over here at the end of the Jewish age
[43:41] the anointed here he comes riding on a
[43:44] white horse those following him on white
[43:45] horses horses Powers dressed in white
[43:48] blood or vegetable dipped in blood wrote
[43:50] the word of God he cometh the mighty
[43:52] conqueror to set up the Millennium
[43:53] coming to the temple Glory there he
[43:56] meets that 144 thousand now let's go to
[43:59] the next one
[44:01] face of the trumpets
[44:03] now what's going to happen is
[44:07] let's just read a quote now notice
[44:09] exactly the continuity of the scripture
[44:11] exactly the same under the seventh
[44:14] trumpet
[44:16] now that's in Revelations over there in
[44:18] eight right right when this when the
[44:21] seventh seal breaks there's silence in
[44:23] heaven if you continue to read a little
[44:25] bit further over
[44:26] you'll see the seventh trumpet is
[44:29] sounding under the seventh trumpet is to
[44:31] Israel the same as the seventh seal was
[44:33] was to the church
[44:36] we find under the seventh seal that we
[44:38] know Souls that were on the altar
[44:40] they'll received roads they were given
[44:41] roads not that they earned them because
[44:43] they were in a dispensation when God was
[44:45] dealing with Grace brother they'll talk
[44:46] about that this morning we the Gentiles
[44:49] not the Jews Israel is saved as a nation
[44:52] that's that hundred forty four thousand
[44:54] they're going to be saved at the 144 000
[44:57] as a nation God deals with Israel as a
[44:59] nation Gentiles are the people for his
[45:01] name not a nation for his name Israel
[45:05] and I think maybe we have one more
[45:08] number five or number three
[45:13] now piece of the trumpets again
[45:15] and at the same time now as soon as this
[45:17] church the bride is drawn together she's
[45:19] taken up and that mystery of the seventh
[45:21] seal on the seventh seal the mystery of
[45:23] going man
[45:26] the Jews is called by The Mystery of the
[45:28] seventh trumpet which is two prophets
[45:30] alive and Moses they come back and
[45:32] there's where Pentecost is all mixed up
[45:34] they're looking for something to happen
[45:37] in other words they're looking for
[45:38] something to happen in the future and
[45:39] the church has done gone and backs to
[45:41] the Jew right all right let's go to the
[45:43] next one number four
[45:45] listen to this
[45:47] because we're going to step back now and
[45:49] turn to
[45:50] Matthew in a minute and start on the
[45:53] field but I want to kind of set up a
[45:55] stage here number four recognizing your
[45:57] day in this message and this is after he
[46:00] preached piece of the trumpets and I
[46:01] went into praying called my wife I'm
[46:02] going in and sincerely I Nat down before
[46:04] God to pray and he revealed to me that
[46:06] the them seven trumpets sounded under
[46:09] the Sixth Seal and I've done preached it
[46:11] supernaturally yeah supernaturally all
[46:15] right and not naturally supernaturally
[46:17] all right so it's not naturally happened
[46:20] it's supernaturally already happened see
[46:22] it's the hand of God the whole thing it
[46:24] pertains to Israel and we picked it up
[46:26] under the seal and you all who have that
[46:30] how the persecution
[46:32] of the Jews can we have one more we have
[46:35] one more
[46:37] they speak back to the face of the
[46:38] trumpet now here's a calling out time
[46:41] and at The Sixth Seal when it when it
[46:43] opened the persecution struck the Jews
[46:45] in the literal standpoint see we're
[46:48] talking spiritual nice and then the
[46:50] literal standpoint all right and here
[46:52] comes the persecution to the church and
[46:54] the ecclesiastical standpoint right
[46:56] that's what's happening now
[46:58] we don't see the sick still open
[47:01] but there's a six seal purging going on
[47:04] now
[47:05] of you and me to get us out of here all
[47:08] right but now look here comes the
[47:10] persecution to the church and the
[47:12] ecclesiastical standpoint but you're
[47:15] spiritual
[47:16] right
[47:18] right right right religion
[47:23] the sabbaths are over because the bride
[47:26] is already called the Sabbath are over
[47:28] and ready for the Jews to be called
[47:29] where to the Feast of atonement now I
[47:31] throw that in there just for you to
[47:33] realize that
[47:35] the Feast of atonement
[47:38] is when they realize that Jesus was
[47:41] already crucified for him not a
[47:43] re-killing of another of another animal
[47:46] but it's not animal blood anymore it's
[47:48] the blood of almighty God where to the
[47:51] Feast of atom an old church don't you
[47:53] see it call to the Feast of atonement to
[47:54] recognize the atonement
[47:56] not no more chickens and geese of what
[47:58] they've been doing the Lamb of God slain
[48:00] from the foundation of the world Israel
[48:02] is going to know that
[48:04] all right now to read all that just to
[48:07] summarize that now what they're going to
[48:10] do is those two prophets are going to go
[48:12] to Israel after we leave
[48:14] they're going to take this message
[48:16] that we're preaching now right
[48:18] right revealed to them
[48:20] and they're going to tell walk in and
[48:22] tell those Jews they're going to say hey
[48:26] no more chickens geese or whatever are
[48:29] lambs
[48:30] because remember they're they're trying
[48:32] now to establish Temple worship
[48:35] go to the Temple Mount uh go to the
[48:38] website for The Temple Mount they're
[48:40] trying their best to get the red heifer
[48:42] they're trying their best to get all
[48:43] these things and we were talking
[48:45] downstairs a couple of weeks ago if you
[48:48] realize this do you know who owns all
[48:50] the pieces of the original Temple
[48:54] who the Catholic church right when Titus
[49:00] destroyed Jerusalem in 80 70 they took
[49:03] the menorah they took the holy of holies
[49:06] they took everything with them and where
[49:09] is it now it's in the Vatican right
[49:10] right that's right
[49:13] so the Jews though think they have to
[49:15] establish the temple worship again so
[49:18] that their Messiah can come right right
[49:20] they got to have a red heifer I've told
[49:21] you to study and look up the five cups
[49:23] of Elijah on the uh I can't remember the
[49:27] name of the website I'm gonna put in cup
[49:29] of Elijah because they said a couple of
[49:31] Elijah they know Elijah's got to come
[49:33] back before Christ comes right
[49:35] the natural Jew knows that they know
[49:37] that now they're waiting for Elijah to
[49:41] come to introduce because they set the
[49:43] cup down they opened the door they look
[49:46] down the road and if Elijah's not coming
[49:48] up the road they close the door and they
[49:49] say until next year
[49:53] so they're waiting for Elijah to come
[49:55] well they're going to get that fifth
[49:56] coming of Elijah but it's going to be
[49:58] through two prophets Elijah and Moses
[50:00] right and they're going to say hey you
[50:02] guys missed it because the forthcoming
[50:04] of Elijah that guy came and revealed
[50:07] everything
[50:09] what see we didn't know anything about a
[50:11] coma we didn't know anything about the
[50:13] Feast of Pentecost
[50:15] oh yeah sure we had the 1906 Isuzu
[50:18] Street and we had a Pentecostal
[50:20] experience
[50:22] but did you know anything about the true
[50:24] atonement until you heard
[50:25] of Jesus Christ and and and just even
[50:28] come into the message and you're we're
[50:30] still learning about the atonement we're
[50:33] still learning what God's doing for us
[50:35] right we didn't get it all at one time
[50:37] so they're not going to get it all at
[50:38] one time the only problem is our Feast
[50:41] of atonement was the second person of a
[50:43] trinity
[50:46] theirs is one true and living God
[50:49] they know that Messiah will be God
[50:51] Almighty you and I were fed a trinity
[50:54] and it took all these years to get the
[50:56] trinitarian doctrine out of us to know
[50:59] that the true atonement was almighty God
[51:01] given his life for you and I not some
[51:04] second person of a trinity so that's the
[51:07] problem with us well not now but still
[51:09] we have come to the Feast of atonement
[51:10] we realize but they have not come to
[51:13] that Feast of atonement yet
[51:16] Acts 2 and 1 says when the day of
[51:18] Pentecost was fully come amen
[51:20] now what happened was before then thanks
[51:23] guys
[51:24] and when the day of Pentecost was fully
[51:26] covered with asking you shall receive it
[51:27] I had one of the damn Pentecost was
[51:30] fully come they were all with one Accord
[51:31] in one place so that was the day of
[51:33] Pentecost you know the Holy Ghost fell
[51:35] on the day it was supposed to fall right
[51:39] Jesus was in the temple every time there
[51:41] was a feast day Jesus was standing in
[51:43] the temple because he was that lamb
[51:46] he was trying to tell him that Lamb's
[51:48] not doing you any good anymore this is
[51:50] the Lamb you need to look at but when
[51:51] they rejected him they said let his
[51:53] blood be on us and our children and
[51:55] that's why the two prophets are going to
[51:56] have to come back and preach Jesus
[51:58] Christ because they were cut off let his
[52:01] blood be on us and our children
[52:03] and you know what I was thinking the
[52:04] other day you can think of that in a in
[52:06] a bad way
[52:07] let his blood be on us and our children
[52:11] but if his blood wasn't covering them
[52:13] Brother Dean
[52:15] they can't come in right man so is it
[52:18] such a bad thing that they said let his
[52:20] blood be on us and our children yes it
[52:22] was because they rejected the Messiah
[52:24] but it's not such a bad thing to be
[52:26] covered by the blood lettuce blood I'm
[52:27] glad his blood is on me Amen in the
[52:31] right way I'm glad it's blood I'm glad
[52:33] that it's combing in I accept that
[52:35] atonement and the blood covers me
[52:37] all right so the blood's been covering
[52:39] them but see what the two problems are
[52:41] going to do they're going to turn around
[52:42] and you know what they're going to say
[52:43] repent
[52:45] and be baptized every one of you in the
[52:48] name of Jesus Christ
[52:49] they're not going to go over there and
[52:50] tell them Father Son Holy Ghost right
[52:52] they gonna say in the name of Jesus
[52:54] Christ for their mission of your sins
[52:55] one of the sixth full purpose do make an
[52:57] end of what
[52:58] Sans all right and you shall receive the
[53:01] gift of the Holy Ghost and that's
[53:02] exactly what they're going to do they
[53:04] they were cut off
[53:06] so that the Gentiles could be grafted in
[53:08] right right all right they were grafted
[53:12] in we were grafted in and then God's not
[53:14] going to forget Israel though he's
[53:15] coming back into profit to do the very
[53:18] same thing right
[53:20] right that's one of the feasts that's
[53:22] why the Feast of trumpets has to come
[53:24] through those two prophets because the
[53:27] Feast of trumpets is what it's a calling
[53:30] of the people right God's calling you
[53:33] and I spiritually under the Feast of the
[53:35] trumpet that's why the Seven Seals and
[53:38] the Seven trumpets I read you the quote
[53:40] brother Brown said they're the same
[53:41] thing right amen the seven sealed to us
[53:43] it's the same as the seventh trumpet to
[53:45] the Jew which is calling us to what the
[53:48] Feast of atonement amen they're calling
[53:50] us to the atonement same way with you
[53:52] and I you know when we really realize
[53:54] the atonement when your body's changed
[53:56] right
[53:57] because he didn't die just for your soul
[53:59] at Calvary he died for your body your
[54:02] spirit and your soul he died for the
[54:04] whole guy right and that's what you and
[54:07] I got to realize
[54:08] we're only accepting a little bit of the
[54:10] pardon that's right remember a pardon is
[54:13] it not a pardon collector said well
[54:15] we've accepted the pardon for our soul
[54:16] right right man
[54:18] why not for this guy right all because
[54:21] it comes from Mom and Daddy and SN and
[54:23] it does this and
[54:25] now that's not what God Said right God
[54:28] said you're perfect that's the same
[54:30] thing with you and I God's going to go
[54:32] over there and he's going to tell those
[54:33] people he's going to say look repent
[54:36] if you repent I'm going to restore you
[54:38] back now I'm not going to restore you
[54:39] back to sonship
[54:42] I'm not gonna restore you back to bride
[54:44] and I'm going to restore you back to
[54:45] sermons and you're going to be right
[54:47] there with me all the time
[54:49] right they're going to be in the temple
[54:51] with us they're going to be in the city
[54:52] with us
[54:56] so let's go to Matthew
[54:58] and let's look
[55:02] because they missed all this
[55:04] but you and I remember let the ass Jesus
[55:10] they ask him what
[55:13] three things right
[55:16] then brother Brown said this was the
[55:18] sealed right okay so we're okay we're
[55:21] we're in the Bible
[55:25] this is not C Spot Run
[55:27] remember that
[55:29] those either working here don't worry
[55:31] about it
[55:32] c-spot run was a first grade reader I
[55:35] know Sister Michelle's not even old
[55:36] enough to remember that
[55:47] all right
[55:49] we don't teach first grade readers then
[55:51] we have to
[55:53] See Spot Run I still had one of those
[55:55] books somewhere my mom may still have
[55:56] them
[55:57] damn sure still reading them
[56:01] Jesus went out
[56:02] Jesus went out Lisa's helping him though
[56:06] Jesus went out and departed from the
[56:09] temple
[56:10] that's my brother
[56:12] Jesus went out and departed from the
[56:14] temple and his disciples came to Empire
[56:15] to show him the building of the what the
[56:18] temple right we're talking about City
[56:19] now right Temple okay
[56:22] and Jesus said unto them see you not all
[56:25] these things barely I say unto you there
[56:27] shall not be left one stone upon another
[56:29] they should not be thrown down and as
[56:31] you set upon the Mount of Olives the
[56:32] disciples came unto him privately saying
[56:34] tell us when shall these things be what
[56:38] shall be the sign of thy coming and of
[56:40] the end of the world
[56:41] all right
[56:42] three things and Jesus answered and said
[56:45] unto them take heed that no man deceive
[56:47] you and if you'll go back
[56:49] end of the sale book I believe it's on
[56:52] the fifth seal of The Sixth Seal brother
[56:53] Brown he breaks these down so we're
[56:55] going to break them down here and show
[56:57] you that that Jesus preached the seals
[56:59] six seals to the people and of course we
[57:02] obviously know that Jesus was the
[57:04] seventh seal which is is coming and
[57:08] Jesus answered and said unto them take
[57:09] heed that no man deceive you for many
[57:12] shall come in my name saying I am Christ
[57:13] and shall deceive many pursue
[57:16] what's profit saved all right
[57:20] second seal is verse six
[57:22] and you shall hear wars and rumors of
[57:24] wars remember the red horse killing
[57:27] right see that you've been out trouble
[57:29] for all these things must come to pass
[57:30] but the end is not yet
[57:33] verse 7 and 8.
[57:36] third seal for nation shall rise against
[57:38] nation and Kingdom against Kingdom there
[57:40] shall be famines pestilence earthquakes
[57:43] in diverse places all these are the
[57:45] beginning of Sorrows then shall you be
[57:47] delivered up to be afflicted and shall
[57:49] then shall they deliver you up to be
[57:51] afflicted and shall kill you and you
[57:53] shall be hated of all Nations
[57:54] for my name's sake right
[57:57] all right that's the fourth seal fifth
[57:59] seal and then shall many be offended
[58:01] before reading this what Jesus was
[58:04] telling now who was he talking to
[58:07] right he was talking to Jews they want a
[58:10] gentile in a bunch
[58:12] unless someone was in the bush she's
[58:13] listening they were no Gentiles they're
[58:14] all Jews all right so he's telling the
[58:16] Jews what's going to happen to them all
[58:18] right because the sales are to them but
[58:21] you and I need to get the spiritual part
[58:23] of this all right
[58:26] and they shall need to be offended shall
[58:28] betray one another and shall hate one
[58:29] another and many false prophets shall
[58:31] rise and shall deceive many and because
[58:33] iniquity shall abound the love of many
[58:35] shall wax cold but he shall endure until
[58:38] the end the same shall be saved now he's
[58:40] telling them what to do they ask him
[58:41] three questions all right
[58:44] and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be
[58:46] preached in all the world for a witness
[58:48] unto all nations and then shall the End
[58:51] come now that's what's happening now in
[58:53] the spiritual part all right when you
[58:56] therefore shall see the Abomination look
[58:58] at verse 15. when you therefore shall
[59:00] see the abomination of desolation spoken
[59:03] of by Daniel the Prophet stand in the
[59:05] Holy place
[59:07] whosoever readeth and understand now we
[59:09] know that when Titus came in and
[59:10] destroyed Jerusalem because Jesus tells
[59:12] them after that to save time says then
[59:15] let them which into in Judea flee to the
[59:17] hills and let him that's on the housetop
[59:19] not come down what's he telling them
[59:21] don't be caught in the city this is the
[59:22] natural part of when uh Titus comes in
[59:25] and levels because remember he said
[59:27] there won't be one stone left on another
[59:29] so that's what Titus did he came in and
[59:31] totally destroyed the temple amen Jesus
[59:34] was telling him not to be there that's
[59:36] the abomination of desolation spoken of
[59:38] by Daniel right then but now we know now
[59:42] that the mosque of Omar are sitting in
[59:43] that same spot right right
[59:46] that's the Abomination is that there's a
[59:49] and we're all Gentiles to a Jew if
[59:51] you're not a Jew you're a gentile I
[59:52] don't care if you're an Islam or you're
[59:54] or whatever you are you're a gentile
[59:56] compared to them so the abomination of
[59:59] desolation is set in there in right over
[1:00:02] the holy of holies right
[1:00:05] that thing's sitting there and the Jews
[1:00:07] can't get to it
[1:00:09] that name were over there 15 years ago
[1:00:12] and they were trying to Tunnel
[1:00:13] underneath to get to it with all that
[1:00:16] over the top they're trying to get to
[1:00:18] because they know that's the spot where
[1:00:20] that Temple was and where it's going to
[1:00:23] be reconstructed again
[1:00:25] right
[1:00:26] but when you therefore shall see the
[1:00:29] abomination of desolation spoken up by
[1:00:30] the name of the Prophet standing in the
[1:00:32] Holy place whosoever readeth
[1:00:34] let him understand right and then just
[1:00:37] keep talking about Great Tribulation but
[1:00:39] I want to try to get to the seals here
[1:00:40] in just a few minutes so we need to
[1:00:42] hurry through let's go to verse 27
[1:00:45] this is a continuation this is where the
[1:00:47] Sixth Seal comes in according to the
[1:00:49] profit from 28 30 28-31 whereas the
[1:00:53] lightning come a thousand East and
[1:00:54] shineth even into the West so shall also
[1:00:56] the coming of the son of man be because
[1:00:58] remember
[1:00:59] remember what we're talking about the
[1:01:00] seals the son of man Ministry was Jesus
[1:01:02] on Earth as the son of man right he was
[1:01:05] God in human flesh
[1:01:07] right now we see that the Son of God
[1:01:10] Ministry was down through seven Church
[1:01:12] ages
[1:01:13] and then for a little while you see it
[1:01:15] at the end time
[1:01:17] not through just William Brown but the
[1:01:19] son of man Ministry is back in powerful
[1:01:21] whether you believe it or not right amen
[1:01:24] this is the son of man Ministry this is
[1:01:26] the Messiah message that that Jesus
[1:01:29] preached that's right for three and a
[1:01:30] half years we get that here remember
[1:01:32] we're talking about Rachel and Liam
[1:01:33] bringing in the types but Sal that son
[1:01:36] of man Ministry doesn't end
[1:01:39] it goes right on over to the Jews
[1:01:42] right because they see the nail prints
[1:01:45] in his hand where you get those scars
[1:01:47] what they see Jesus through those two
[1:01:49] Prophets
[1:01:50] so he's so we're not just talking about
[1:01:52] us
[1:01:54] this is not just the son of man just to
[1:01:56] you and I right those two prophets were
[1:01:59] gone in human flesh to those people over
[1:02:01] there in Jerusalem all right so now look
[1:02:04] hope you're also the coming of the son
[1:02:06] of man beef or who orsoever the carcass
[1:02:08] is there where the Eagles begin you say
[1:02:10] well that's us well that's Israel too
[1:02:13] right
[1:02:14] Israel will come one is the Feast of
[1:02:16] trumpets
[1:02:17] the in gathering what does the trumpet
[1:02:20] do it denotes a war
[1:02:23] or it's trying to tell you something
[1:02:25] in the days of the voice of the Sabbath
[1:02:27] Angel when he begins to say what he
[1:02:29] calls out and we come in like Dad said
[1:02:32] this morning it says come out of her my
[1:02:34] people well that's to us coming out of
[1:02:36] denominations and that's also the Jews
[1:02:39] coming out of that
[1:02:40] junk that's over there now the 144 000
[1:02:44] coming out of her my people all right
[1:02:47] who's her and start Roman Catholicism
[1:02:50] Doctrine I don't care what age it was in
[1:02:52] I don't care what time it was in to us
[1:02:56] or the 144 000 that's what it is it's a
[1:02:59] it's religion right all right it's that
[1:03:02] Roman religion that come in
[1:03:05] so where's whoever the carcass is there
[1:03:07] when the Eagles begin
[1:03:09] of us and also speaking of the 144 000
[1:03:12] right now look six seal immediately
[1:03:14] after the tribulation of those days
[1:03:16] shall the sun be darkened and the moon
[1:03:18] shall not give her life the Stars shall
[1:03:21] fall from Heaven and the powers of the
[1:03:22] heavens shall be shaken and then shall
[1:03:24] appear the son of man in heaven and then
[1:03:27] shall all the tribes of the earth mourn
[1:03:28] and they shall see the son man coming in
[1:03:30] the Clouds Of Heaven with power and
[1:03:32] great glory and he shall send his angels
[1:03:34] with a great sound of a trumpet and they
[1:03:36] shall gather together his elect from the
[1:03:39] Four Winds from one end of Heaven
[1:03:42] to the other all right so now let's go
[1:03:45] to revelation 6.
[1:03:47] one
[1:03:49] now remember
[1:03:51] we have been going through the field
[1:03:53] that has been going through them
[1:03:55] breaking them down
[1:04:00] and at number four going into number
[1:04:03] five
[1:04:04] so now let's watch and see the natural
[1:04:07] opening of the seal because we get the
[1:04:10] spiritual part right remember they get
[1:04:12] the natural part we get the spiritual
[1:04:14] part of the of the seven trumpets they
[1:04:16] get the natural part of the seven
[1:04:17] trumpets all right and I saw when the
[1:04:20] lamb opened one of the seals and I heard
[1:04:22] it was a noise of Thunder one of the
[1:04:23] four beasts saying come and see you said
[1:04:25] well the four beasts are gone from the
[1:04:26] Earth from work when we're gone that's
[1:04:28] exactly correct but brother Brown said
[1:04:30] the four Beast was what the Holy Ghost
[1:04:32] now watch the Holy Ghost gonna be doing
[1:04:34] he's gonna be in two Prophets
[1:04:36] you see how can he be two places one
[1:04:38] time how can you be in a million places
[1:04:40] at one time right it's gone yeah
[1:04:44] it's not for us to understand for us to
[1:04:47] believe that that I can be born again
[1:04:48] here and somebody can be in Alaska
[1:04:50] preaching the same message and it's the
[1:04:52] same Holy Ghost but we're four thousand
[1:04:54] miles apart right so don't wonder about
[1:04:57] well how can the Holy Ghost be here and
[1:04:58] even be hearing him be here the four
[1:05:00] beasts is connected to the bride we know
[1:05:03] that right and it's the Holy Ghost and
[1:05:05] the bride
[1:05:06] but now those four beasts are going to
[1:05:09] absolutely help those 144 000 or it's a
[1:05:12] different Holy Ghost okay is that all
[1:05:15] right and I saw and behold a white horse
[1:05:18] and he didn't sell him had a bowl and a
[1:05:20] crown was given on him and he went forth
[1:05:21] conquering in the conquer now we know
[1:05:24] that that in the natural the spiritual
[1:05:27] opening of that seal that brother Brown
[1:05:28] typed that was the first page it being a
[1:05:31] saying you know right
[1:05:33] it wasn't a person
[1:05:35] it was a little spirit that went out oh
[1:05:37] yeah that's right well now listen when
[1:05:38] we leave out of here and God starts
[1:05:40] dealing with the Jews I don't think that
[1:05:43] man of sin see remember he's not the
[1:05:46] Antichrist
[1:05:48] the Beast
[1:05:50] fulfilled I think he's going to start in
[1:05:52] with flattery just like he did in the
[1:05:54] first church
[1:05:55] he's not going to come in as soon as we
[1:05:57] leave and go I'm it this is it no he's
[1:06:00] going to come in why he's going to make
[1:06:02] them sign a pack that's what the
[1:06:04] scripture says he's going to make them
[1:06:06] sign a document that okay we'll we'll
[1:06:08] give you your Menorah back
[1:06:11] that's right we'll give you all your
[1:06:13] gold back we'll give you all your altars
[1:06:16] and all your your stuff but but you're
[1:06:18] gonna have to do this yeah
[1:06:21] because remember he holds all the gold
[1:06:23] and he holds all the wealth and he holds
[1:06:25] all the bonds right he's got everything
[1:06:27] under his control but he's not going to
[1:06:29] come in and just boom I don't think he's
[1:06:31] not going to do that because see we look
[1:06:33] over after the 1260 days and we see that
[1:06:36] they find out the world finds out the
[1:06:38] Jews find out they've been duped
[1:06:40] right because that's what the battle of
[1:06:42] Armageddon is going to be about right
[1:06:44] they're going to figure out that
[1:06:45] something happened right so see the the
[1:06:47] first the first horse rider he's going
[1:06:50] to be religious
[1:06:52] oh he's going to be a white righteous
[1:06:54] shirt he's not going to be a devil like
[1:06:56] he ends up after 1260 days no he's going
[1:06:59] to come in with flattery the Bible says
[1:07:01] right right and we don't have time to
[1:07:03] read every scripture but you understand
[1:07:04] what I'm saying and I saw him Behold a
[1:07:06] white horse and he had a bow and the
[1:07:08] crown was given on him remember he was a
[1:07:09] bluff
[1:07:10] he was a blessed in the first stage as
[1:07:12] far as the spiritual part of of us
[1:07:14] seeing the seal in the spiritual part
[1:07:17] right but in the natural part he's going
[1:07:20] to be the same thing now he's not going
[1:07:21] to ride over there on a white horse he's
[1:07:23] riding in the people that's right that's
[1:07:26] right all of Israel he's writing in all
[1:07:29] of Israel because they all signed that
[1:07:31] Pact all right then God's gonna say come
[1:07:34] out of her my people he's going to draw
[1:07:36] out 144 000. just like you and I were in
[1:07:40] the church ages
[1:07:42] right Baptist methodists and all those
[1:07:44] things he's gonna what
[1:07:47] come out of her my people all right
[1:07:50] but he's a blessed and he's still a
[1:07:52] bluff he has no power unless God give
[1:07:54] him he's a bluff because the Bible says
[1:07:56] one day we're going to look at the Devil
[1:07:58] that's what a man laying in a ditch on
[1:08:01] the side of the road
[1:08:02] and we're going to look down and say is
[1:08:04] this the man that calls Nations
[1:08:08] to fall amen and us and billions of
[1:08:11] people to die is this the man that
[1:08:14] caused all that
[1:08:15] dress the same way here he's going to
[1:08:17] start out as a little saying a little
[1:08:19] deed a little Doctrine a bluff he's
[1:08:22] going to bless them people right because
[1:08:24] when he becomes the full incarnate Beast
[1:08:27] at the end after the 1260 days he's
[1:08:30] gonna say I'm the man
[1:08:33] right I've been the man all along that's
[1:08:36] right now I've got you all under my
[1:08:38] control and the next one they're gonna
[1:08:40] start punching the buttons for the
[1:08:43] battle of Armageddon everybody okay with
[1:08:45] that so we're just kind of we're going
[1:08:46] to run through them because I promise
[1:08:48] you I would and when he had opened the
[1:08:49] second seal I heard the second beef say
[1:08:52] come and see and there went out another
[1:08:53] horse that was red
[1:08:55] and brother they'll touched on it this
[1:08:57] morning they're going to kill those 144
[1:08:59] 000. they're going to kill those two
[1:09:00] prophets right right that's right just
[1:09:02] like they killed the people in the Dark
[1:09:04] Ages why did they kill the people in the
[1:09:06] Dark Ages
[1:09:07] because they went against the Catholic
[1:09:09] church right
[1:09:12] any different here are we seeing a
[1:09:14] pattern
[1:09:15] we're seeing a pattern God's in a
[1:09:17] pattern remember God's got a plan and a
[1:09:19] purpose
[1:09:20] and his plan and purpose is not just to
[1:09:23] do us one way and do Israel another no
[1:09:25] he's going to redeem them the same way
[1:09:27] he redeems us right and when he had
[1:09:29] opened the second seal I heard the
[1:09:31] second beast say and they went on
[1:09:32] another horse that was red and Powell
[1:09:34] was giving him to selling him to take
[1:09:35] peace from the earth what's this guy
[1:09:36] gonna do
[1:09:38] he's going to do that
[1:09:41] those new prophets are going to be
[1:09:42] preaching and he's going to be anti
[1:09:44] against anything they say oh yeah
[1:09:46] because they're going to preach the true
[1:09:47] word of God but he's not going to sit
[1:09:49] here at first he's not going to deny it
[1:09:52] he's going to do just like he did before
[1:09:54] he's going to ease his way in
[1:09:57] say well
[1:09:59] brother Brown was wrong here
[1:10:03] but over here he's okay and yeah and and
[1:10:05] you can't really listen to 47 to 63 you
[1:10:10] know just 63 and above and and now after
[1:10:13] 63 he really wasn't right then well next
[1:10:16] thing dude that's to find another profit
[1:10:18] if he was that confused and I don't
[1:10:20] think he was actually I know what he was
[1:10:21] right and I went on another horse it was
[1:10:24] red and power's given what he's getting
[1:10:25] a little more power
[1:10:27] sat on him take peace from the earth
[1:10:28] that they should kill one another
[1:10:31] Wars are still going on here there's
[1:10:34] going to be peace on the earth for a
[1:10:35] little while but remember what the Bible
[1:10:37] says about
[1:10:38] when you hear of Peace then what sudden
[1:10:41] destruction right
[1:10:42] where's it going to come from it's going
[1:10:45] to come from that Beast that Antichrist
[1:10:47] system
[1:10:49] that's going to do the killing they're
[1:10:50] going to kill those 144 000.
[1:10:53] and the one on another horse that was
[1:10:55] red take peace from the earth they
[1:10:56] should kill one another and was given
[1:10:57] unto him a great sword in other words a
[1:10:59] word
[1:11:00] power was given power was given all
[1:11:03] right
[1:11:04] and I'll be held and look he opened the
[1:11:06] third seal and I heard the third Beast
[1:11:07] say come and see him Behold a black
[1:11:09] horse he'll sound him a pair of balances
[1:11:12] in his hand
[1:11:13] what the gold of the world he's he's
[1:11:16] accumulating wealth he's not going to
[1:11:18] quit accumulating well during this time
[1:11:20] he's going to still accumulate wealth
[1:11:23] while the two witnesses are preaching
[1:11:25] bringing 144 000 out just like you and I
[1:11:29] hey folks those same horses are here
[1:11:31] today
[1:11:33] right here right
[1:11:35] right we're not immune to them yet I
[1:11:38] said yeah we're not immune to them
[1:11:40] they're still here they're working on
[1:11:42] you they're they're working on me
[1:11:43] they're they're in our brain Santa I
[1:11:45] wish you'd shut up
[1:11:49] but remember
[1:11:52] you see a black you see a white horse
[1:11:54] he's going to come in just want it right
[1:11:56] just you okay assistant she's cold and
[1:12:00] I'm sweating
[1:12:01] she does have a lot when I'm sitting
[1:12:03] over here she does it so I can see it
[1:12:04] she throws it way out like
[1:12:08] catch it out of my vision and I'll turn
[1:12:10] it down so I'm not over there now so
[1:12:13] okay that's all right okay
[1:12:15] but you're seeing comes a white horse
[1:12:18] as a red horse
[1:12:20] and as a black horse just like he's
[1:12:23] coming down through the church ages as
[1:12:25] brother Brandon was talking about
[1:12:26] because remember when he was get up to
[1:12:28] the Black Horse He was talking about
[1:12:30] Luther and Wesley a great time of
[1:12:33] Revival as far as man's intelligence I
[1:12:35] said man's intelligence right it was the
[1:12:38] age of man which was that Beast was a
[1:12:40] man Beast right right same way what's
[1:12:42] going to happen you think he's going to
[1:12:44] get any Dumber no he's going to get
[1:12:45] smarter and smarter
[1:12:48] because we're gone now he's worried
[1:12:50] about 144 000 people he's not worried
[1:12:53] about the bride we're gone we're
[1:12:54] protected we're in glory so he's not
[1:12:56] dealing with us
[1:12:57] and I believe he knows he's got just a
[1:12:59] little bit of time that's why he's got
[1:13:01] to kill that 144 000 but when they
[1:13:03] resurrect and those two prophets
[1:13:05] resurrect but even when that happens
[1:13:07] it's going to be a day of Blackness
[1:13:10] don't you think
[1:13:12] because when Bailey
[1:13:15] there is nothing this whole world's
[1:13:17] going into total Blackness because
[1:13:19] there's no holy ghost on the earth why
[1:13:21] do you think the battle of Armageddon is
[1:13:22] going to be an all-out War
[1:13:25] there's going to be nothing here to stop
[1:13:26] it right right see we're not being
[1:13:29] killed because of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:31] protecting us right
[1:13:33] 144 000 during that 1260 days and those
[1:13:37] two profits the Holy Ghost is going to
[1:13:38] protect them right from being killed but
[1:13:42] when they're gone
[1:13:44] who's going to be there to protect
[1:13:46] there's nobody there to protect
[1:13:50] remember the foolish virgins being
[1:13:51] hunted down like dogs during that time
[1:13:53] they're being killed
[1:13:55] all right because you see the killing is
[1:13:58] not going to be it's not just going to
[1:13:59] be toward 144 000 right when we leave
[1:14:02] it's going to be Unleashed around the
[1:14:03] world
[1:14:05] it's going to be a worldwide thing the
[1:14:07] devil is going to just unleash
[1:14:09] everything he's got
[1:14:11] because he doesn't have you and he's
[1:14:13] Unleashed it on us remember the 200 000
[1:14:15] 000 demons brother Brown said it was
[1:14:16] least Unleashed on the end time bride to
[1:14:20] drive her back into our homeland which
[1:14:21] is the word of God so those two hundred
[1:14:23] thousand thousand demons are going to
[1:14:25] come right back over onto the children
[1:14:27] of Israel or the 144 000 and they're
[1:14:30] going to direct their power right toward
[1:14:32] them but God's going to protect them
[1:14:34] until they're killed but after that
[1:14:36] watch
[1:14:37] and I heard the message before be saying
[1:14:39] measure I'm sorry let's go back to three
[1:14:43] when he had opened the third seal I hold
[1:14:45] the third the third third Beast say come
[1:14:47] and see and I'll be healed and lower
[1:14:49] Black Horse and hit it selling him had a
[1:14:51] pair of balances in his hand and I Heard
[1:14:53] a Voice in the midst of the four B say a
[1:14:55] measure of wheat for a penny and three
[1:14:57] measures of barley for a penny and see
[1:14:58] thou not hurt the oil and wine that's
[1:15:00] what I was just saying now I missed that
[1:15:02] part I'm sorry I'm glad the Lord brought
[1:15:03] me back to that but remember brother
[1:15:05] Ryan said that was not the voice of any
[1:15:07] of the Beast that was the voice of the
[1:15:09] Lamb amen right man so they're 144 000
[1:15:12] they're going to be protected just like
[1:15:14] we are by this right here see thou not
[1:15:16] hurt the what
[1:15:18] the Holy Spirit
[1:15:20] in the 144 000 and in the two witnesses
[1:15:23] you see how they're getting the natural
[1:15:24] part of this because Jesus preached the
[1:15:27] seals over there we're talking about
[1:15:28] wars and rumors of wars and false
[1:15:30] christs well guess what
[1:15:32] that's what's going to be there
[1:15:35] beating on those 144 000 right and I
[1:15:38] heard the voice in the midst of the 4B
[1:15:39] say a measure of wheat for penny three
[1:15:41] measures of barley for a penny because
[1:15:43] you know what brother Brown said there's
[1:15:45] going to be famines pestilence there's
[1:15:47] gonna be all things going on around the
[1:15:48] world while these two prophets are
[1:15:51] preaching and we're going to see in a
[1:15:53] minute I'll read this quote to you where
[1:15:55] under the Sixth Seal they break these
[1:15:58] things to the world
[1:16:02] they are the six seal they're the ones
[1:16:04] that's going to speak and all these
[1:16:06] things are going to happen who the two
[1:16:07] Prophets
[1:16:09] the two prophets are going to break that
[1:16:10] sick seal standing on earth right right
[1:16:12] that's right right and when he had
[1:16:14] opened the force Hill I heard the voice
[1:16:15] of the fourth Beast say come and see you
[1:16:17] know let me hold a Pale Horse
[1:16:19] his name that said on him was death and
[1:16:21] Hell Followed With Him and power was
[1:16:23] given on him for the fourth part of the
[1:16:25] earth to kill his sword
[1:16:27] and with hunger and with death and with
[1:16:28] the beasts of the earth and the light
[1:16:30] Rodell said that fourth
[1:16:33] that fourth that horse is a pale Grizzly
[1:16:37] Porsche a sickly horse
[1:16:40] but that's when the power of that Beast
[1:16:42] is going to be so powerful so he's going
[1:16:45] to be the one in Thessalonians that
[1:16:47] walks in and tells those guys says hey
[1:16:51] no more sacrifices remember in Daniel 70
[1:16:53] weeks it says that he'll confirm the
[1:16:55] Covenant with many for a week
[1:16:57] but in the midst of the week he will cut
[1:16:59] it off so after three and a half years
[1:17:01] or 1260 days
[1:17:03] everybody with me
[1:17:04] after 1260 days he's going to walk in
[1:17:08] and say no
[1:17:10] you're not gonna do that anymore
[1:17:12] because of sacrifice and oblations will
[1:17:14] cease he'll make it stop and he'll say
[1:17:16] what I'm the guy
[1:17:19] I'm the one
[1:17:21] I'm God
[1:17:22] worship me
[1:17:24] and the Jews of course 144 000 is going
[1:17:27] to be gone the two witnesses are going
[1:17:28] to be gone right so what's going to
[1:17:30] happen
[1:17:31] well the fifth seal we know watch what
[1:17:33] the fish said when he opened the fifth
[1:17:34] seal I saw under the altar The Souls of
[1:17:37] them that will slain for the word of God
[1:17:38] and for the testimony which they held
[1:17:40] that's what brother Dale was talking
[1:17:41] about today
[1:17:42] and for those of you that that are not
[1:17:45] following along and I'm not saying that
[1:17:47] drugstore I'm just saying you come in in
[1:17:49] the middle of a series because brother
[1:17:51] Dale and I were more like teachers so we
[1:17:53] have to you know teach 10 sermons before
[1:17:55] we get a point across about it and um
[1:17:57] that's just the way it is
[1:18:00] but when it opened the fifth seal and he
[1:18:01] was talking this morning about the souls
[1:18:03] under the altar that was slain for the
[1:18:05] word of God and for the testimony which
[1:18:07] they held now if you read the fifth seal
[1:18:09] that's a fifth seal Jew that's a
[1:18:11] testimony they held not the testimony of
[1:18:13] Jesus Christ that's the testimony they
[1:18:16] have which what we're Jews that's it
[1:18:19] that's it
[1:18:20] they don't believe Jesus Christ but
[1:18:22] God's giving them eternal life because
[1:18:24] he had to Blind them on the cross he had
[1:18:27] to Blind them so that you and I could
[1:18:29] come in so if he blinded them then he's
[1:18:31] going to have to take that blindness
[1:18:32] because remember the Bible says
[1:18:33] blindness in part has happened right
[1:18:36] so let the Gentiles could come in right
[1:18:38] so now he's taking the blindness away
[1:18:41] from the 144 000 but he's still got that
[1:18:44] fifth sealed Jew that's already dead so
[1:18:47] he can't he can't redeem them they're
[1:18:49] already dead all right so he's going to
[1:18:51] give them eternal life but listen this
[1:18:54] is connected with 144 000 and a little
[1:18:57] piece watch this
[1:18:59] for the testimony we sell when they cry
[1:19:00] with a loud boy saying how long the Lord
[1:19:02] holy and proved us thou not judge and
[1:19:04] avenge our blood see if it was a
[1:19:06] Christian it wouldn't say avenge our
[1:19:07] blood right so we know this is the fifth
[1:19:10] sealed Jew
[1:19:12] Hitler killed and all the ones down
[1:19:14] Through the Ages avenge our blood on
[1:19:15] them that dwell on the Earth question
[1:19:17] mark
[1:19:18] they're asking that question and white
[1:19:21] robes were given unto every one of them
[1:19:22] and it was said unto them that they
[1:19:25] should rest yet for a little season
[1:19:27] until their fellow servants
[1:19:29] but the Jews that are on the Earth right
[1:19:31] 144 000 it's alive
[1:19:34] and also and their Brethren what Jews
[1:19:37] got to be Jews that they should be
[1:19:39] killed as they were
[1:19:41] should be fulfilled so the 144 000 and
[1:19:43] the two witnesses are going to have to
[1:19:45] be killed
[1:19:46] according to here we see that
[1:19:49] until that fellow sermon also on their
[1:19:51] Brethren they should be killed as they
[1:19:53] were should be fulfilled
[1:19:55] and I'll be home we open the Sixth Seal
[1:19:57] and though there was a great earthquake
[1:19:59] the sun became black the sackcloth of
[1:20:01] hair and the moon became his blood and
[1:20:02] stars of Heaven fell into the Earth even
[1:20:04] as fig leaves casteth her untimely fruit
[1:20:06] when she's shaking of A Mighty Wind
[1:20:09] we can go on but we know that look the
[1:20:11] kings of the earth and great men rich
[1:20:13] men so there must be people alive
[1:20:16] 944 000 and those two witnesses
[1:20:19] after they're resurrected I don't know
[1:20:21] how much longer they're going to be
[1:20:22] around here because the Bible doesn't
[1:20:24] say the Bible just says there was a boy
[1:20:25] said come up hither and they took a
[1:20:27] Rapture if they're around here a day 10
[1:20:30] days two weeks months whatever doesn't
[1:20:32] matter but right here's what's going to
[1:20:34] happen that is going to run through that
[1:20:37] Sixth Seal because brother Brown said
[1:20:38] they are that Sixth Seal they open it
[1:20:40] whenever they want to so when they open
[1:20:42] it then buddy that's when it's going to
[1:20:44] really start but that's when that battle
[1:20:46] arm again is going to get real hot and
[1:20:48] heavy but they're not going to be
[1:20:49] hearing the two Jews or not the two
[1:20:51] witnesses not going to be there all
[1:20:52] right so you see that
[1:20:55] now
[1:20:59] let's don't do second Thessalonians for
[1:21:01] time let's just go down to the last
[1:21:03] quote
[1:21:05] number six just finish it up with it
[1:21:08] because we've already Revelation now
[1:21:11] look
[1:21:12] here's what's gonna happen
[1:21:15] The Sixth Seal is the Tribulation period
[1:21:18] that's what takes place the bride has
[1:21:20] gone see this is in the Sixth Seal
[1:21:22] there's no living creature nothing there
[1:21:25] to say it it's just now God is not
[1:21:26] dealing with the church no more it's
[1:21:28] been gone he's dealing with Israel see
[1:21:31] this is the other side yeah this is when
[1:21:34] Israel receives the message of the
[1:21:36] Kingdom what what's the first thing
[1:21:38] Jesus preached the son of man said the
[1:21:39] Kingdom of Heaven is at hand first thing
[1:21:42] and two witnesses are going to preach
[1:21:43] the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand all
[1:21:45] right by the two prophets of Revelations
[1:21:46] 11 remember Israel is a nation God's
[1:21:49] servant Nation and when Israel is
[1:21:52] brought in it'll be a national Affair
[1:21:54] Israel the kingdom age is where David
[1:21:56] the son of David sits on the throne
[1:21:58] that's the reason that woman cried thou
[1:22:01] son of David and David is the son of
[1:22:03] David God swore by him to David that
[1:22:05] he'd raise up his son that would take
[1:22:07] his throne remember the Millennium is
[1:22:09] not to us I've already said this one
[1:22:10] time I'm saying it again the Millennium
[1:22:12] is not to us it absolutely has nothing
[1:22:15] to do with us right amen right according
[1:22:18] to description according to promise
[1:22:19] message the Millennium has nothing to do
[1:22:21] with us we're eternal we're with our
[1:22:25] king that's right that has nothing to do
[1:22:28] with that right right but God promised
[1:22:30] David that he would have a son that
[1:22:33] would sit on the throne and would what
[1:22:36] watch over the 12 tribes of Israel
[1:22:39] during a time and that's what the
[1:22:41] Millennium is a millennium is for the
[1:22:44] Jews it's not for us brother Brown said
[1:22:46] we're there on a honeymoon
[1:22:48] well now you don't take your bride
[1:22:49] somewhere Danny didn't take you
[1:22:50] somewhere and make you work for a week
[1:22:52] when y'all did honeymoon right
[1:22:54] no we're there for a honeymoon to have a
[1:22:56] wonderful time they gonna bring us
[1:22:58] things they're going to be our servant
[1:23:00] right
[1:23:01] that's the reason the woman cried thou
[1:23:03] son of David and David is the son of
[1:23:05] David God swore by him to David that he
[1:23:07] had raised up his son that would take
[1:23:08] the throne and it would be an
[1:23:10] everlasting Throne see it have no end
[1:23:12] Solomon gave it in a pipe in the temple
[1:23:14] and Jesus just told them here that there
[1:23:16] won't be a rock left on one one of them
[1:23:19] what he's reading Matthew 24.
[1:23:22] but he's trying to tell them here what
[1:23:25] he's coming back when are you coming
[1:23:27] back these things shall take place
[1:23:29] before I come back
[1:23:31] and here they are now we're at the time
[1:23:33] of the tribulation remember when the
[1:23:35] kingdom is set up on the earth now this
[1:23:36] may be a little shocking if there's a
[1:23:39] question you still ask me if you want to
[1:23:41] put the question up afterwards because I
[1:23:43] just hit it if you didn't if you don't
[1:23:44] already know it in the time of the
[1:23:46] Millennium it's Israel that's a nation
[1:23:49] the 12 tribes of the nation but the
[1:23:51] bride is in the palace
[1:23:53] we live in the temple
[1:23:56] she's a queen now she's married and all
[1:23:59] of the Earth shall come into this city
[1:24:00] Jerusalem and shall bring the glory of
[1:24:03] it in there all right just get them down
[1:24:04] for time do you see that in there not
[1:24:07] the bride
[1:24:09] not the bride isn't going to be out here
[1:24:11] laboring in advance no sir she's a bride
[1:24:14] Queen to the king it's the others that
[1:24:17] labor out there the nation not the bride
[1:24:19] amen all right notice these Messengers
[1:24:21] now these messengers of Revelation 12
[1:24:23] these two prophets they're going to
[1:24:25] preach the kingdom is at hand see the
[1:24:27] kingdom of Heavens to be set up
[1:24:31] the last time the last three and a half
[1:24:33] years of Daniel 70th week promised to
[1:24:35] the Jews his people remember now
[1:24:38] that to prove that that this is Daniel's
[1:24:40] last part of the 70th week I got a
[1:24:42] question on that for tomorrow see now 70
[1:24:44] weeks was promised which was seven years
[1:24:47] everybody okay with that I know
[1:24:49] everybody didn't go to church here knows
[1:24:51] that for a fact that there's there was a
[1:24:53] seven year Ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:24:54] promise to restore us and to restore
[1:24:57] Israel right we just talked about the
[1:25:00] last half of it the 1260 days that the
[1:25:02] two prophets preached and Jesus preached
[1:25:05] the first three and a half himself right
[1:25:06] right
[1:25:08] but now remember
[1:25:10] that doesn't mean that there's only
[1:25:11] three and a half years left after the
[1:25:13] Rapture
[1:25:14] there's one wheat left after the Rapture
[1:25:16] because you got to restore the city
[1:25:18] that's right we can't restore the city
[1:25:20] during the 1260 days right right because
[1:25:23] the Gentiles are still here just like a
[1:25:25] red day in Revelations 11 1-2
[1:25:28] they left that out of court for the
[1:25:29] Gentiles so there's no way they can
[1:25:31] restore the city until everybody's out
[1:25:33] of the way those 144 000 are going to
[1:25:36] have to come back to this earth and
[1:25:38] start that bringing an Appalachian
[1:25:40] righteousness self-devision and Prophecy
[1:25:41] in the anoint the most holy during the
[1:25:43] last half of that week to the Jews
[1:25:45] everybody understand that
[1:25:47] right we got it yes okay all right
[1:25:52] where was that
[1:25:54] and in the midst of the seven weeks oh
[1:25:56] wait a minute I got a question for that
[1:25:57] now 70 weeks was promised which is seven
[1:25:58] years so it was only a seven year
[1:26:00] Ministry of Jesus Christ right right
[1:26:02] three and a half he preached by himself
[1:26:04] and the three and a half that is due to
[1:26:07] the Jews the 1260 days all right but now
[1:26:11] you and I we get the revelation of that
[1:26:13] three and a half years you see that we
[1:26:15] get the revelation of that three and a
[1:26:16] half years just like Jacob
[1:26:19] worked seven years for Rachel
[1:26:22] right seven years for Lee anywhere seven
[1:26:25] years for Rachel which is three and a
[1:26:27] half that Jesus preached plus the
[1:26:28] Revelation that we're preaching now is
[1:26:31] the revelation of that three and a half
[1:26:32] weeks that Jesus prayed all right so
[1:26:35] Rachel was the one he was looking for
[1:26:36] anyway but he got Leah remember which is
[1:26:39] a type of old old Israel and in the
[1:26:42] midst of the seven weeks the Messiah was
[1:26:43] to be cut off to be made a sacrifice
[1:26:46] that was back there at Calvary right he
[1:26:48] would prophesy three and a half years
[1:26:50] and then he'd be cut off for a sacrifice
[1:26:51] for the people and still a determination
[1:26:54] that three and one half years are still
[1:26:56] determined for Israel and that's what
[1:26:58] we've been talking about today right yes
[1:26:59] that's the 1260 days
[1:27:02] notice now we find out that the times
[1:27:04] time lasts I said three and a half years
[1:27:07] of Daniel 70 weeks let me explain that a
[1:27:09] little closer now because I see somebody
[1:27:10] here that's always watched that now
[1:27:13] I want to try to make myself clear a
[1:27:15] teacher notice when the 70 weeks come in
[1:27:18] when Daniel seen the vision of the time
[1:27:20] coming and the ending of the Jews
[1:27:22] but he said there was determined 70
[1:27:24] weeks that seven years you see how he's
[1:27:27] brought that every bit of that 70 weeks
[1:27:28] down to one seven year period three and
[1:27:31] a half when Jesus preached here three
[1:27:33] and a half when Jesus is going to preach
[1:27:35] to the prophets the 1260 days all right
[1:27:38] so the whole 70 weeks is income passion
[1:27:41] 117 year period that's seven years in
[1:27:45] the midst of it while the Messiah would
[1:27:46] be here we'd be cut off for a sacrifice
[1:27:48] now that's exactly what taken place then
[1:27:50] God built with a gentile so he took out
[1:27:52] a people for his name as soon as the
[1:27:55] Gentile church is taken out he taken up
[1:27:57] the church and when he did the sleeping
[1:27:59] virgin the church itself the bride went
[1:28:02] up and the church itself was put into
[1:28:04] outer Darkness with his weeping and
[1:28:05] wailing and ashing of teeth and the same
[1:28:07] time the tribulation falls upon that
[1:28:10] people when we leave the tribulation
[1:28:12] begins right and while the tribulation
[1:28:15] is falling in there comes these two
[1:28:17] prophets of Revelations 11 to preach the
[1:28:20] gospel to them
[1:28:21] and they preach a thousand one hundred
[1:28:24] and three score days which is actually a
[1:28:25] thousand two you learned three four days
[1:28:27] that's why what's exactly what 30 days
[1:28:30] in a month like the real calendar has is
[1:28:31] exactly three and a half years that's
[1:28:33] Daniel's 70th part last part of the 70th
[1:28:36] week
[1:28:37] all right
[1:28:39] God doesn't deal with Israel now you
[1:28:41] know God's dealing with Israel when
[1:28:42] we're out of here there you are there
[1:28:44] you are see how the seals open down
[1:28:47] there in the church age
[1:28:49] us
[1:28:50] how it showed the martyrs right watch
[1:28:54] him typing back and forth we get the
[1:28:56] spiritual part they're going to get the
[1:28:58] natural part because see and now here's
[1:29:00] these two prophets standing here with
[1:29:02] the word of God to do anything to Nature
[1:29:05] they want to they shape the Earth and it
[1:29:07] shows exactly who does it it's Moses and
[1:29:10] Elijah because there's their ministry
[1:29:12] reimbursemented again both men oh my do
[1:29:14] you see it now see what that six seal is
[1:29:17] it's those prophets
[1:29:18] now notice don't let it choke you but
[1:29:21] watch what happened what opened that
[1:29:24] seal prophets see amen there you are oh
[1:29:27] we're living in the eagle day brother
[1:29:29] what's he talking about Revelation
[1:29:31] brother head up among the clouds they
[1:29:34] opened that Sixth Seal they have power
[1:29:36] to do it amen there's your Sixth Seal
[1:29:40] coming open
[1:29:41] until those two prophets opened that
[1:29:43] sick seal and there is a quote where
[1:29:45] like brother Dale said last week
[1:29:47] they are that sixth ceiling right so you
[1:29:50] see a one through six we see
[1:29:55] that those seals open to the Jews in the
[1:29:58] literal standpoint
[1:29:59] they opened us spiritually now we're
[1:30:02] preaching them but we have to see that
[1:30:05] we got to see the spiritual part amen
[1:30:08] before the natural part can take place
[1:30:10] because as long as we're still here it
[1:30:13] can't open to them all right but there's
[1:30:16] going to be somebody that's going to
[1:30:17] catch the spiritual part there's going
[1:30:19] to be somebody that's going to say I see
[1:30:21] that and they're going to apply that to
[1:30:23] their life and like brother now said
[1:30:25] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:30:27] of the Holy Ghost and the opening of the
[1:30:29] word and toward the adoption series you
[1:30:32] got first horse second horse third horse
[1:30:34] and fourth horse
[1:30:36] then five six and seven is your fifth
[1:30:39] seal six seven so he's still showing how
[1:30:42] it's done and who does it Christ does
[1:30:45] all those right it's nothing we've done
[1:30:47] it's all Jesus Christ then it goes to
[1:30:50] two prophets and they do the same thing
[1:30:53] they stand over there and nothing can
[1:30:55] come against them right they open that
[1:30:57] seal they see see they see what's going
[1:31:00] on they're like we do now
[1:31:03] we see the opening of the seal in the
[1:31:06] spiritual part where they're going to
[1:31:07] come over there and realize they're in
[1:31:09] the natural opening of the seal but
[1:31:11] they've got to call out a group of
[1:31:13] people according to Redemption
[1:31:16] which the seals are Redemption that's
[1:31:19] right but we'll get into it next time
[1:31:21] maybe Lord willing the next time we we
[1:31:23] Minister we'll we'll show the Feast of
[1:31:25] the trumpets because the trumpets have
[1:31:28] to sound
[1:31:30] if the trumpets are the same
[1:31:32] to them as a seal guard to us then
[1:31:35] there's got to be a connection between
[1:31:37] those two just like I said about the
[1:31:39] atonement and all those things like that
[1:31:40] it's a wonderful study I know people
[1:31:43] I've heard ministers many times say that
[1:31:45] that the Feast of the trumpets was so
[1:31:47] messed up that brother Brown didn't know
[1:31:48] what he was talking about I'm tired of
[1:31:50] listening to those people
[1:31:53] I'm tired of that amen I'm tired of it
[1:31:57] I'm tired of people talking about my
[1:31:58] profit that's right I want us to stand
[1:32:01] up one day and do like brother Rams said
[1:32:02] I want us to look at people and say
[1:32:04] you're not preaching what Apollo Creek
[1:32:05] right you're not preaching what William
[1:32:07] Brown and preaching and I say that
[1:32:09] myself to anybody that comes against the
[1:32:11] prophet saying he was wrong right yeah
[1:32:15] if he's wrong we need to find another
[1:32:17] one because we got to find somebody
[1:32:18] that's right to get us out of here
[1:32:21] because remember we were talking about
[1:32:22] righteousness do you know what
[1:32:23] righteousness means to be right
[1:32:26] if you're wrong you're not righteous
[1:32:29] that's why God's not wrong
[1:32:31] when God brings a message and he says
[1:32:33] that he says it's thus said the Lord
[1:32:35] then that you know what the problem is
[1:32:37] me that's right that's right if you can
[1:32:40] put it in Scripture
[1:32:41] Richard Marlow right you put it in
[1:32:43] scripture we put it in scripture if we
[1:32:46] put it in Scripture
[1:32:48] I don't care what anybody says
[1:32:52] I still know what the word says and
[1:32:53] brother Brown couldn't be anything but a
[1:32:55] word Prophet that's right he got it from
[1:32:58] the word he caught the mind of God the
[1:33:01] revelation of what we need he caught
[1:33:04] that and brought us that love letter out
[1:33:07] of that Bible same thing those two
[1:33:10] prophets are going to do they're gonna
[1:33:12] say you missed it and this is where you
[1:33:15] missed it I don't they don't have to
[1:33:17] take a message book over there they're
[1:33:19] going to prove it to him out of the
[1:33:20] Bible and you know what
[1:33:23] they gonna prove it to him out of the
[1:33:24] Old Testament that's right
[1:33:30] the Old Testament
[1:33:32] because remember the Jews don't care a
[1:33:33] thing about New Testament because I
[1:33:35] don't believe but when the Messiah comes
[1:33:36] they're going to say okay look now we
[1:33:37] got a whole book
[1:33:39] right right now New and Old Testament
[1:33:41] this is where you missed it and now look
[1:33:43] all right
[1:33:45] here's what God was saying about you
[1:33:47] that's right
[1:33:49] you're in here
[1:33:50] 144 000 12 000 out of every tribe but
[1:33:55] you know what you and I are going to
[1:33:56] have to see the same thing
[1:33:58] that they see
[1:34:01] that God in my name's in here too
[1:34:04] I may be a gentile
[1:34:06] and and I may not be my name name
[1:34:09] because my name is in the book Samuel
[1:34:12] you know
[1:34:15] but
[1:34:17] if I don't see my name in here like the
[1:34:19] 144 000 they're gonna have to see their
[1:34:21] name in the book
[1:34:22] because that book in Revelation 5 that
[1:34:25] we were talking about that was the name
[1:34:26] of the redeemed right
[1:34:29] and you can only be considered in
[1:34:30] Redemption if you see your name in the
[1:34:32] book because if your name's not in the
[1:34:34] book you're not considered in Redemption
[1:34:35] Glory man so the 144 000 they're gonna
[1:34:38] have to see their name brother Mark in
[1:34:40] the book
[1:34:41] just like you and I are gonna have to
[1:34:42] see our name in the book
[1:34:44] to see that we have been redeemed right
[1:34:47] then when we see and everything's open
[1:34:49] then guess what this is going to go
[1:34:51] right over to Israel
[1:34:54] not a quote book
[1:34:58] those two prophets are going to say
[1:34:59] there was a group
[1:35:01] of gentiles
[1:35:03] dogs
[1:35:05] that's right that believed this and took
[1:35:09] a Rapture and you know what they're
[1:35:11] going to say sister Johnny what's your
[1:35:13] problem
[1:35:14] what's your problem you're God's chosen
[1:35:17] he knows there's going to be 144 000 of
[1:35:19] you whether you like it or not there's
[1:35:20] going to be 144 000 you're gonna make it
[1:35:22] amen amen that's what I've always said
[1:35:25] you know I've always said there's going
[1:35:27] to be a bride
[1:35:44] confess for every one of us
[1:35:46] but that's Catholicism
[1:35:48] he's not a priest right when it comes to
[1:35:51] like being a Catholic priest he's not
[1:35:54] gonna
[1:35:55] do pants on you and and you make it
[1:35:57] because he makes it you gotta make it
[1:36:00] for yourself because the Bible said
[1:36:02] we're all priests and kings and we're
[1:36:05] Reign Over this Earth but you know what
[1:36:06] God's got to come to us first yeah right
[1:36:09] man here's my whole point God's got to
[1:36:11] come to us first sure through the
[1:36:13] opening of the seals amen through the
[1:36:16] opening of Revelation 6 1 to 6 19 that's
[1:36:19] got to open up to you and I right right
[1:36:20] that's why Prophet had to come and he
[1:36:22] had to put those pieces together
[1:36:25] he's the only one who could do it to
[1:36:27] make it a beautiful picture because if
[1:36:28] you read straight through six one to 19
[1:36:30] you can't understand
[1:36:31] all right because it kind of jumps
[1:36:33] around a little bit but according to the
[1:36:36] prophet it's all laid out perfect and if
[1:36:38] you don't listen to him it's all laid
[1:36:39] out perfect right and when they take it
[1:36:41] and lay that down to that 144 000
[1:36:43] they're gonna say
[1:36:45] where did you get those scarves
[1:36:49] right he's gonna say in the house of my
[1:36:51] friend right right a group made it over
[1:36:54] there in America out of the most hideous
[1:36:56] nation in the world out of laodice
[1:36:59] sister Gail the most the worst of worst
[1:37:03] those two witnesses are going to say God
[1:37:05] pulled out a group of people right and
[1:37:07] they made it because of this right here
[1:37:09] so we're preaching to you today repent
[1:37:12] yes and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:37:14] Christ I hope they feel that Jordan
[1:37:16] River full of them
[1:37:18] baptize them right there where Jesus
[1:37:20] started every bit of the bat where John
[1:37:21] started baptizing I hope they baptized a
[1:37:23] whole 144 000 right there in the in the
[1:37:25] Jordan River
[1:37:26] but you see now you and I though we're
[1:37:28] going to be in glory but right now you
[1:37:31] and I are going to have to take those
[1:37:34] seals
[1:37:36] because the sales was given for this guy
[1:37:38] right here that's right exactly right
[1:37:40] right the seals were given for the
[1:37:42] Redemption of this body
[1:37:45] not for the soul it is for the soul part
[1:37:48] of it but remember
[1:37:50] there's a lot of people didn't get the
[1:37:51] opening of the seals it's going to be in
[1:37:54] the bride
[1:37:55] Son of God Ministry that's right right
[1:37:58] right that's right but the son of man
[1:38:00] Ministry is this guy's gonna get changed
[1:38:02] that's right amen which is the opening
[1:38:04] of The Seven Seals which is the opening
[1:38:06] of the trumpet so the of the vowels and
[1:38:08] the plague showing us that God's doing
[1:38:10] something right here like Dad said this
[1:38:13] morning the greatest battle ever fought
[1:38:14] well Armageddon is going to be the
[1:38:15] greatest battle there was on the face of
[1:38:16] the Earth right right between men
[1:38:19] religions well guess what what's
[1:38:22] fighting you now religion right religion
[1:38:25] is what's killing us right and right
[1:38:28] here this is the battle of Armageddon
[1:38:30] for us
[1:38:31] but thank God we're not going to be here
[1:38:32] when the literal part happens right but
[1:38:35] we're going to overcome
[1:38:36] because there's no weapon formed brother
[1:38:38] Aaron there's no weapon formed amen
[1:38:42] there's no weapon formed amen that's
[1:38:45] going to take this guy right here right
[1:38:50] right and put it like this
[1:38:52] it's not Us beside Christ
[1:38:55] it's not a Perugia right
[1:38:57] no that's not standing here
[1:39:00] but God's standing in here now that's
[1:39:02] right he wants this Temple this is the
[1:39:04] Temple of the Holy Ghost let's stand
[1:39:06] right this is what's going to the Jews
[1:39:08] not this literal man you see Samuel down
[1:39:10] junior standing in front of you right
[1:39:14] right but it's going to be the
[1:39:15] Revelation that we get amen the
[1:39:18] revelation we get brother Bonnie that's
[1:39:20] what that's why we got to get the
[1:39:22] Revelation right
[1:39:23] amen the Revelation has got to be
[1:39:26] correct or it can't go to Israel that's
[1:39:28] right you can't take a false Doctrine to
[1:39:30] them Jews that's right it's like that
[1:39:32] Jim said he said you can't you can't
[1:39:39] he won't take it
[1:39:41] so anything contrary to the word to me
[1:39:43] is transarian I am that's right because
[1:39:46] where did the trinitarian doctrine come
[1:39:48] from the prophet said come from the pits
[1:39:50] of hell right
[1:39:52] so if we don't see one true and living
[1:39:53] God
[1:39:54] we're sure not going to be able to take
[1:39:56] it to Israel right let's sing song
[1:40:01] they're doing a great job aren't they
[1:40:02] great job
[1:40:06] if there is a future this is our future
[1:40:08] amen yeah

[1:44:09] us
[1:44:28] classroom
[1:45:09] what's up
[1:45:14] because you know they know we missed
[1:45:15] Jehovah
[1:45:17] maybe I miss Jehovah God they know him
[1:45:19] as a seven compound names of Jehovah
[1:45:22] but they don't think he's come yet
[1:45:25] what a bless the thing to know that he's
[1:45:27] already come and we can call him all
[1:45:30] these names and we get all these
[1:45:31] Redemptive blessings before Israel gets
[1:45:34] them because see look how look what a
[1:45:36] look what a God that we served and if we
[1:45:38] turn him down look what we get right
[1:45:40] right
[1:45:43] we get blinded brother Brown said God
[1:45:46] blinded Israel on purpose he said if
[1:45:49] you're blind you do it yourself right
[1:45:52] and there's no cure for that there's no
[1:45:56] seal for that there's no Redemption for
[1:45:58] that if you turn him down you can't say
[1:46:01] no God you didn't tell no
[1:46:03] only to Israel he blinded Israel so he's
[1:46:07] the one that's going to redeem them amen
[1:46:09] right we blind our own eyes remember I
[1:46:12] read you that quote the other day and he
[1:46:13] blind if we blind our own eyes there's
[1:46:15] no Redemption for that right you and I
[1:46:18] are just on our way to hell
[1:46:20] so you and I realize one thing's for
[1:46:22] sure we ought to be the Most Blessed
[1:46:24] people on the face of this Earth amen
[1:46:26] knowing that God has come to us showed
[1:46:28] us Redemption first showed us full
[1:46:31] Redemption and now he's going to take
[1:46:33] that little part and he's going to send
[1:46:34] it over to the ones that should have
[1:46:36] been his wife
[1:46:39] Israel should have been his wife
[1:46:42] they turned him down exactly so when
[1:46:45] they turned him down he still couldn't
[1:46:47] forget him because he said they're woven
[1:46:51] in my thinking they're just as how can
[1:46:54] you count the Stars how can you count
[1:46:56] the Sands of the sea he says I can't
[1:46:58] forget Israel
[1:47:00] because there's people right
[1:47:02] but he had to take out a little piece to
[1:47:04] bring a bride in because he was looking
[1:47:06] at Rachel because she was very pretty
[1:47:09] Leah was the owner but Rachel was very
[1:47:12] beautiful the Bible said and Jacob
[1:47:14] worked seven years to get Rachel
[1:47:16] and that's what he's done for you and I
[1:47:17] he's worked all this time to get a bride
[1:47:20] ready
[1:47:21] to get somebody who will be able to
[1:47:23] stand in this end time
[1:47:26] and not let this bother him and not let
[1:47:28] that bother him and not let this bother
[1:47:30] and not let this false Doctrine over
[1:47:32] here and his false Doctrine over here
[1:47:35] remember
[1:47:36] he's going to come and knowledge is
[1:47:39] going to increase and we'll uh what is
[1:47:41] it we said about the elite silly women
[1:47:43] women churches
[1:47:44] that's what's going to happen he's even
[1:47:46] going to get give the church a strong
[1:47:48] delusion that they they believe in that
[1:47:50] I lie and be damned by it that's right
[1:47:52] believe a lie and God's going to let
[1:47:54] that happen
[1:47:55] but not to his not to his bride all mine
[1:47:59] who in the world would treat their wives
[1:48:00] like that
[1:48:01] almighty God we serve never will let us
[1:48:05] fail because we're predestinated not to
[1:48:08] fail you and I are going to make it amen
[1:48:10] amen we're going to make it by the skin
[1:48:12] of our teeth but we're going to make it
[1:48:14] remember the five wise virgins said hey
[1:48:16] we just got enough oil to get us in you
[1:48:18] need to go get your own that's right in
[1:48:20] other words I've come to church for a
[1:48:21] long time and I've gotten I'm full
[1:48:24] I don't got any more I give you
[1:48:26] you should have come to church when the
[1:48:27] door's rolling that's right that's right
[1:48:29] you should have listened to the message
[1:48:31] that's what they're going to say you
[1:48:33] should listen you should have heard we
[1:48:35] got just enough to get us in but you
[1:48:37] know what that is just enough to get us
[1:48:38] in we are going to make it we're gonna
[1:48:41] make it Glory you know the Lord amen all
[1:48:45] right anything can be said before we go
[1:48:48] now I don't know where we're going to
[1:48:49] have the class here or downstairs so
[1:48:51] just hang around those of you that's
[1:48:52] going to stay I think sister Michelle
[1:48:54] and the uh the two friends she has that
[1:48:58] are here with her
[1:49:00] I've seen brother Daniel likes her too
[1:49:04] you know I've known them for a long time
[1:49:06] we we started going to youth camps way
[1:49:08] back in the late 90s and she was just a
[1:49:10] young kid back then so she's I told her
[1:49:12] I said you're a pastor's wife now I said
[1:49:14] because God started putting that
[1:49:15] highlighter in your hair
[1:49:18] that's right look at my mom keep gray
[1:49:22] headed dude so you pray for pastors
[1:49:26] lives not just for pastors you pray for
[1:49:28] pastors wives my brother Brown said when
[1:49:30] he died called the man he called the
[1:49:31] woman with her women so you pray for her
[1:49:34] too because I'm going to tell you
[1:49:35] something it's tough
[1:49:37] it's real tough
[1:49:39] but just keep him in your prayers thank
[1:49:40] you thank you for coming honestly really
[1:49:42] did
[1:49:43] um we have went through the Financial
[1:49:44] Peace University class we finished it
[1:49:47] last Sunday
[1:49:48] we don't have all of our numbers tallied
[1:49:50] up but I know for a fact that we saved
[1:49:53] that we paid off about 70 or 80 000 in
[1:49:57] debt in nine weeks
[1:50:00] paid off around that seventy eight
[1:50:02] thousand dollars in debt
[1:50:04] and we avoided almost a hundred thousand
[1:50:07] dollars in debt that we would have had
[1:50:09] and we not have taken the class so
[1:50:13] you're looking at about a two hundred
[1:50:15] thousand dollar turnaround
[1:50:17] much less uh 14 or 15 000 I think they
[1:50:21] that we put in savings between that nine
[1:50:23] week period so you know we
[1:50:26] we trust in God
[1:50:28] and we all gathered together last Sunday
[1:50:30] downstairs and we held hands and we
[1:50:32] prayed and I pray for each one of them
[1:50:34] and we've all prayed for each other and
[1:50:36] it takes prayer right but it takes some
[1:50:38] of this right here God give you a brain
[1:50:42] like brother Brady said I've told you
[1:50:43] many times brother Brady said God give
[1:50:45] you five senses you need to start using
[1:50:47] them right all right
[1:50:50] because you I don't believe you can be a
[1:50:52] well-rounded Christian if you don't have
[1:50:53] your finances straight
[1:50:55] I just don't I just do not believe that
[1:50:57] because God don't want you to be wrong
[1:50:59] in one place and right in another
[1:51:02] this has taught me to look and
[1:51:06] and try to do things in a Godly way
[1:51:08] first
[1:51:09] trust God sure
[1:51:11] and like I was telling them a couple
[1:51:12] weeks ago we were somewhere and I said
[1:51:14] well I told him that brother Collins
[1:51:15] Thursday night I said look I said we're
[1:51:18] going to trust God
[1:51:19] I'm gonna trust God for a new job so
[1:51:22] brother Mark I'm not coming in for about
[1:51:23] three months I'm gonna sit at home and
[1:51:25] wait for God to bring me a job
[1:51:28] that don't work
[1:51:31] no God wants you to do he wants you to
[1:51:33] have a party you know why it's like Dave
[1:51:35] Ramsey said he said you you need to see
[1:51:37] the part of giving because
[1:51:40] remember he read the scripture
[1:51:44] he said God gave
[1:51:49] his only begotten son
[1:51:52] so God forgive her
[1:51:54] we know he did it himself but the
[1:51:56] scripture says he gave his only begotten
[1:51:59] son right so God's a giver that's what
[1:52:02] God wants us to do he don't need our
[1:52:03] money
[1:52:04] but he wants you to give to get the
[1:52:07] blessings right go ahead
[1:52:09] Malachi says you pay your time I'll pour
[1:52:11] out a blessing
[1:52:14] read the whole Book of Proverbs The Book
[1:52:16] of Proverbs tells you
[1:52:18] that
[1:52:19] if you handle any finances right God
[1:52:21] give you more to handle right
[1:52:23] if he doesn't
[1:52:26] he won't give me any more
[1:52:28] right same thing with the word of God he
[1:52:31] knows you're not going to handle the
[1:52:33] word of God right he's not going to give
[1:52:34] you any more God's a good daddy amen
[1:52:37] amen and remember
[1:52:39] God's knows are better than any yeses
[1:52:43] God tells you no that's the best yes
[1:52:46] you'll ever get in your life
[1:52:47] because he knows what you'll do if he
[1:52:49] says yes and he knows what you'll do if
[1:52:52] he says no
[1:52:53] and if he says no you know one thing's
[1:52:56] for sure brother Eddie you would have
[1:52:57] done something wrong if he would have
[1:52:58] said yes
[1:53:00] because when God says no Then you think
[1:53:02] that is the best yes you'll ever get
[1:53:04] because he's a heavenly father that
[1:53:06] knows the end from the beginning if we
[1:53:09] would have known the end from the
[1:53:10] beginning we'd
[1:53:11] have begun our lives a lot different
[1:53:13] but we don't we're finite and living in
[1:53:16] a finite world we need an infinite God
[1:53:18] though to come and teach us
[1:53:19] and in scripture there's 800 scriptures
[1:53:22] about money and finances in the Bible so
[1:53:24] it's very important I believe to have a
[1:53:28] good well-rounded Christian Life you got
[1:53:30] to have your finances straight because
[1:53:32] you know what
[1:53:33] Hey Brother Dale like you said he paid
[1:53:35] for all these kits and probably
[1:53:38] four or five thousand dollars worth of
[1:53:40] kits
[1:53:42] he needs the money now guess what we got
[1:53:45] him to give back to him if you'll handle
[1:53:47] your finances right you'll have a little
[1:53:48] bit set aside that you can give the
[1:53:50] money back if he needs that money right
[1:53:54] God works in mysterious ways but I'm
[1:53:56] really glad that that you know probably
[1:53:58] 90 percent of y'all have went through
[1:54:00] this class and it has really
[1:54:03] um
[1:54:03] some it helps more than others that's
[1:54:06] okay
[1:54:07] he's gonna take just a little part of it
[1:54:10] and watch your finances and watch your
[1:54:12] life then God's going to bless you yes
[1:54:14] sir God will bless you he said I'll pour
[1:54:16] out the windows of Heaven you know you
[1:54:17] do your tithes and offerings right on
[1:54:19] correct the windows handled so let's
[1:54:21] take him at his word
[1:54:23] try sometimes
[1:54:25] just try sometime make sure everything's
[1:54:28] well-rounded you know you you what I
[1:54:30] said many times when we first started
[1:54:32] this course even when we taught the
[1:54:33] first one was that I wanted to see
[1:54:36] husband and wife closer together
[1:54:38] because you two are one whether you like
[1:54:40] it or not
[1:54:41] right right
[1:54:43] yes thank you you two are one whether
[1:54:47] you like it or not and all the finances
[1:54:49] is one anyway God give it to you a hurry
[1:54:51] to one it's all together right it's his
[1:54:54] and he's just gonna let you operate for
[1:54:56] a little while that's right
[1:54:58] but remember
[1:55:00] God gave
[1:55:02] his only begotten son so he's a giver
[1:55:04] he's the first Giver
[1:55:06] because he give his life for us so now
[1:55:09] what we give back to God
[1:55:12] that's just something we do because we
[1:55:14] love him
[1:55:15] I don't pay my ties because I have to
[1:55:18] I pay my ties because I love the Lord
[1:55:20] and I don't pay that tire check say God
[1:55:22] now you said you'd pour out of a
[1:55:23] blessing no it just comes with the
[1:55:25] territory right brother Gabe how many
[1:55:27] times have we seen now
[1:55:30] me and brother Gary's walked in life
[1:55:31] together a good bit I mean how many
[1:55:32] times have you seen God bless you if
[1:55:34] you'll do what he says all right that's
[1:55:35] pretty simple in it I'm gonna bless you
[1:55:37] when you do what he says just the way it
[1:55:39] is so let's bless him
[1:55:41] by asking him to bless us yeah right and
[1:55:44] give us a good week
[1:55:46] sure absolutely you know the secret to
[1:55:48] all of this is work
[1:55:50] yes we got a daughter if she had one job
[1:55:54] in her lifetime she's 55 years old
[1:55:57] somewhere
[1:55:59] and uh she's uh
[1:56:01] lost a lot of jobs that's went out of
[1:56:03] business in her lifetime
[1:56:05] but on Monday morning
[1:56:07] she was temp service
[1:56:10] and he's blessed her
[1:56:12] and the Secret's work absolutely and I
[1:56:15] think we've lost it yeah
[1:56:17] as a nation did that yes absolutely
[1:56:19] we're not a working Nation
[1:56:25] that's what Dave Ramsey said he said you
[1:56:27] wanna he said you wanna have money
[1:56:29] he said get a job
[1:56:33] that's not gonna
[1:56:36] that's entitlement God's not he's not
[1:56:38] you know he's not going to give you
[1:56:40] a big wad of money but you know what if
[1:56:42] you go out and make money and you do
[1:56:43] well and you put it back into his work
[1:56:45] yep he's going to bless you it's like
[1:56:48] brother dick I've said many times
[1:56:51] and I'll say this for the glory of God
[1:56:53] not because he's my father but my dad's
[1:56:56] worked all his life
[1:56:59] and he's got everything he needs but you
[1:57:03] don't want to give God the glory first
[1:57:05] and he does the things right he handles
[1:57:08] well Mama handles the finances right but
[1:57:10] they're a team we suppose I'm working
[1:57:12] together a member of free spirits and
[1:57:14] nerds you know the Nerds the one that
[1:57:15] saved the money and the free spirit
[1:57:17] spends it but it takes both of you
[1:57:19] thanks a little free Spear and it takes
[1:57:21] a little nerd I was a free spirit and
[1:57:22] Jim was a nerd
[1:57:24] but now we're both nerds we're real
[1:57:26] nerdy now
[1:57:27] because we don't yeah there's the free
[1:57:29] spirit right there
[1:57:33] Susan's had to throw the net over him
[1:57:36] and
[1:57:38] sent your bottom
[1:57:40] stuff flying out of his pocket you know
[1:57:42] it's a full-time job right it's a
[1:57:44] full-time job but you know what you
[1:57:46] realize that that's what this course
[1:57:48] does it realize it helps you realize
[1:57:50] what you are and you work in that
[1:57:52] you worked in your ability
[1:57:53] now I'll I'll become a nerd now because
[1:57:56] I don't spend money like I used to but
[1:57:58] man my uncloth is full y'all see it next
[1:58:00] time Saturday I'm gonna sell some of
[1:58:02] that stuff
[1:58:03] I don't need it all but I had it at one
[1:58:06] time and it was a bunch of stuff and I
[1:58:08] shouldn't have I should have been saving
[1:58:09] that money or or you know I've always
[1:58:11] wanted to be where a minister walked in
[1:58:14] and needed something and him a hundred
[1:58:16] dollars
[1:58:17] handy fifty dollars handing 200 whatever
[1:58:20] and just give it out of the goodness of
[1:58:21] your heart not have to not have to go
[1:58:22] back
[1:58:23] and worry about where you're going to
[1:58:25] pay a bill or not right right you know
[1:58:27] it feels good I've had to I've been able
[1:58:29] to do that recently you know and and
[1:58:31] give that little girl down that uh
[1:58:34] uh Ryan's the other day she had a table
[1:58:36] of eight people
[1:58:38] they left her two pennies for a tip oh
[1:58:41] two pennies and she was about in tears
[1:58:44] because somebody picked the two pennies
[1:58:45] up somebody we were a bunch of us were
[1:58:47] there somebody picked the two pennies
[1:58:48] out and said what is this and she said
[1:58:49] well that's all I got
[1:58:52] out of eight people at a table
[1:58:55] and she stuck them in her apron and
[1:58:58] she's wiping the table off you know and
[1:59:00] I'm sure she was thinking in her mind
[1:59:01] probably not very good thoughts yeah
[1:59:04] I'm human I'd probably the same way
[1:59:08] but I just reached in my pocket and I
[1:59:10] got a 20 bill out
[1:59:12] I just stepped in there
[1:59:14] all right we're stuck in her apron she
[1:59:17] wants that she said I don't have your
[1:59:18] table you know her table was over here I
[1:59:20] said that's for the people that didn't
[1:59:21] couldn't give you a tip if they couldn't
[1:59:23] afford it then I can afford it I'll just
[1:59:24] give you twenty dollars
[1:59:26] she did cry then I mean she was bawling
[1:59:28] man she was crying but it makes you feel
[1:59:30] good
[1:59:31] you know to be
[1:59:37] 14 and a half percent because no 120 and
[1:59:41] make her a day we're still human people
[1:59:43] we still live in a human world right
[1:59:45] just like sister Michelle coupons you
[1:59:47] may not think a thing about them but you
[1:59:49] know what
[1:59:49] if God give you 90 percent of your money
[1:59:52] back
[1:59:54] he only asked for 10. right
[1:59:57] he get he owns 90 of that 90s hits too
[2:00:00] but he gives you that 90 to be a steward
[2:00:03] of right and I read you a quote not too
[2:00:06] long ago for brother Brown said you're
[2:00:07] going to give an account for the money
[2:00:09] you spend
[2:00:10] apparently you're going to give an
[2:00:11] account for it right I don't want to
[2:00:14] have that on my slate
[2:00:15] I don't have that on my sheet where I
[2:00:18] have to give an account for for spending
[2:00:20] something idly or or stuff like that but
[2:00:22] take that 90 and if you can if you can
[2:00:24] correctly use that 90 percent you'll
[2:00:27] never out give God right but if we can
[2:00:29] save
[2:00:30] from this couponing class then
[2:00:34] I believe it's God
[2:00:36] I believe God helps us because he knows
[2:00:38] we're humans and he knows we have ups
[2:00:41] and downs and problems and ins and outs
[2:00:42] and you know what what's most of our
[2:00:44] problems money
[2:00:46] come on baby money is most of our
[2:00:48] problems if we have a problem in an area
[2:00:51] you say well no it's me and my husband
[2:00:52] fighting oh let's dig on back this a
[2:00:55] little bit further
[2:00:56] that we ain't got the money for this or
[2:00:59] we don't have the money for that or we
[2:01:00] don't have the money for that right
[2:01:02] so it's pretty much all money and we
[2:01:04] hate that but we still live in a world
[2:01:07] where
[2:01:08] um we're not able to give out anything
[2:01:10] but money tomorrow when we go to work
[2:01:13] we're expecting money as pay and then
[2:01:15] when we go to Walmart they're expecting
[2:01:17] money in return for the services that we
[2:01:19] give them so money has got a good part
[2:01:21] in our life you know but maybe that uh
[2:01:24] since we got sister Michelle here she
[2:01:26] can help us keep some of that money
[2:01:29] coach couponing will help you keep some
[2:01:31] of that money
[2:01:32] and brother Benny helped us out by by
[2:01:34] showing us some things too he's a pretty
[2:01:36] good coupon guy himself so we thank God
[2:01:39] that we got people that that
[2:01:41] like that that took enough emphasis to
[2:01:44] say hey I'll pay for that yeah and you
[2:01:46] come and you learn
[2:01:48] learn how to do
[2:01:50] you know do your finances learn how to
[2:01:53] do your money right because I don't want
[2:01:55] to get I got enough I'm gonna have to
[2:01:56] give an account for
[2:01:58] yeah I hope money I hope is not one of
[2:01:59] them
[2:02:00] brother didn't sister girl I look at
[2:02:02] them it's four o'clock and I'm gonna
[2:02:03] talk another 30 minutes
[2:02:05] brother didn't accept the Gale has
[2:02:07] always been a good example
[2:02:10] she told me one time they didn't have
[2:02:12] enough money to where church was helping
[2:02:13] you right when Dick broke his leg or
[2:02:15] something couldn't work they brought
[2:02:16] food to your house now that's the low
[2:02:19] part of
[2:02:20] of their life right it's like Dave said
[2:02:24] he said broke his he said broke
[2:02:25] shouldn't be a way of life
[2:02:27] broke is just a passageway through
[2:02:31] we've all been broke in our life
[2:02:33] somewhere right we've all been broke in
[2:02:36] our life somewhere brother Dean's sister
[2:02:37] paid the same way now that they what
[2:02:39] they do they become smart with their
[2:02:41] money right
[2:02:42] and now you know what they're retired
[2:02:44] and they're not having to pinch pennies
[2:02:46] they go out and do what they want to do
[2:02:47] and they enjoy life I I applaud anybody
[2:02:51] that can retire and enjoy themselves
[2:02:53] about anybody I don't care if you're 50
[2:02:55] years old my brother I don't hold one
[2:02:57] thing against him retired when he was 44
[2:02:59] years old and I don't God knows I know
[2:03:01] never I know I just wish I could do that
[2:03:05] but he you know what he's doing
[2:03:07] well I was out messing playing with my
[2:03:09] money he was putting his up
[2:03:12] he was saving it and you know what he
[2:03:14] can retire 44 years old
[2:03:17] so you see
[2:03:18] and he can enjoy life and he can give
[2:03:21] money when people need money and he can
[2:03:22] give to the church when the church needs
[2:03:24] it because he done what he started the
[2:03:27] right way and he listened to Mama where
[2:03:29] I didn't
[2:03:30] so wait yes I think the most important
[2:03:34] thing about money and having money
[2:03:37] is make sure you give your money to God
[2:03:40] first person we saw a time in our life
[2:03:43] that we did not have money to tithe if
[2:03:46] we had him we might not have had enough
[2:03:48] grocery money coming in but he made the
[2:03:51] decision that we're going to tithe
[2:03:53] regardless right and we started tithing
[2:03:56] even when we didn't have it right and I
[2:03:58] don't know what happened but somewhere
[2:04:00] along the line God just worked a miracle
[2:04:02] right and and
[2:04:08] maybe 25 saving never touching it and it
[2:04:12] just first thing you know and then he
[2:04:13] was telling Brother Ray the other day I
[2:04:16] got a statement one time it's been years
[2:04:18] ago and I handed it to him and said
[2:04:20] explain this to me and he looked at and
[2:04:22] he says Gail you've got over a hundred
[2:04:24] thousand dollars in this account and I
[2:04:27] had you know I didn't check them I
[2:04:28] didn't pay any attention to him or
[2:04:30] anything and that's God sure that's
[2:04:32] right nothing but God that's right
[2:04:34] because we were young with kids didn't
[2:04:36] know how to save didn't know how to do
[2:04:38] anything but he knows how sure so make
[2:04:41] sure you tired no matter what no matter
[2:04:43] what how poor you are make sure you give
[2:04:45] God
[2:04:47] you've never seen a righteous forsaken
[2:04:49] or received begging for Prince or don't
[2:04:51] worry
[2:04:51] if you might have to eat some soup and
[2:04:53] ramen noodles
[2:04:55] but our water in ramen noodles and then
[2:04:58] noodles and rum and water
[2:05:00] whichever one but
[2:05:03] he said he would supplier needs not our
[2:05:05] wants he'll Supply your need
[2:05:08] all right back to the store of brother
[2:05:10] brother Nick sister Gayle they weren't
[2:05:13] a four-letter word
[2:05:15] work
[2:05:17] they worked hard and they had they
[2:05:18] they're able to enjoy now brother they
[2:05:20] ain't seem to pay the same way Mom and
[2:05:21] Daddy and some of your others but you
[2:05:23] see people come to the end part of their
[2:05:25] life the one that's struggling
[2:05:27] I don't like to see that I don't like to
[2:05:29] see it June's mother lives on 900 a
[2:05:31] month
[2:05:33] 900 a month how many of y'all can live
[2:05:35] on 900 a month we hardly live on 900 a
[2:05:38] week
[2:05:39] but she wasn't smart with her money
[2:05:42] so she's come down to where we have to
[2:05:44] take care of her a little bit well thank
[2:05:45] God we can take care of her but I don't
[2:05:47] want to be a burden on anybody I I don't
[2:05:49] I don't want to do that like I said I
[2:05:51] want my slate clean and my sister Gail
[2:05:53] said pay your tires
[2:05:55] God will pour out the windows of Heaven
[2:05:58] he will bless you if you pay your time
[2:05:59] right and you know what one year when I
[2:06:03] when I owned jng one year I paid more
[2:06:05] time June and I paid more tithes than I
[2:06:07] made
[2:06:08] the first year I was on salary at
[2:06:11] McDonald's I made about eight thousand
[2:06:14] dollars a year seventy nine hundred and
[2:06:16] twenty dollars I think was my first
[2:06:17] salary in 1979 at McDonald's
[2:06:21] and in
[2:06:22] 1996 seven
[2:06:24] June and I tithe about 8 800.
[2:06:29] so I tithe more than I made and I'm sure
[2:06:32] you probably have too tithe more than
[2:06:34] you made your first job and you wonder
[2:06:36] how you made it on the 80 on the 7 900
[2:06:39] and here you are giving God 8 800 and
[2:06:43] you're living 20 times better
[2:06:45] so listen got to do that I'm sorry to
[2:06:47] keep you on but got to do that God will
[2:06:50] keep his promises you and I are going to
[2:06:52] have to be able to keep ourselves
[2:06:54] we promised something somewhere we
[2:06:56] better be able to keep that promise see
[2:06:59] I don't make promises much because I
[2:07:02] might have to break them because I'm
[2:07:04] human but God it don't matter to him
[2:07:06] he'll make a promise and it doesn't
[2:07:07] matter he'll see it fulfilled don't pay
[2:07:10] your tires pay your offering do the
[2:07:13] right thing pay your debts
[2:07:19] like Dave said he said here show me one
[2:07:22] place in the Bible that that's good
[2:07:24] there's not one scripture in the Bible
[2:07:26] that said dead is good but I know we
[2:07:28] have to have it brother Brown even said
[2:07:30] for you rent and car and stuff like that
[2:07:31] we don't we can't accumulate money and
[2:07:33] help not have rent but we not we not
[2:07:36] have twenty thousand dollars on a credit
[2:07:37] card that we don't even know where to
[2:07:39] win
[2:07:40] our Panther on credit card don't even
[2:07:42] know where it went
[2:07:43] at least with a car you're going to look
[2:07:44] at four wheels and you got a way to get
[2:07:45] to work so you look at a house and you
[2:07:47] can get my house and you can be you know
[2:07:49] cool when it's hot and hot when it's
[2:07:50] cool
[2:07:51] but when you just go out in frequency
[2:07:53] spend money and you don't know where it
[2:07:54] went to and you don't know
[2:07:56] you got to pay it back
[2:07:58] right so that's the part that God don't
[2:08:01] want you to do he don't want you to be
[2:08:03] in so much debt till you can't get out
[2:08:05] right I don't know where I started here
[2:08:08] but let's play our heads
[2:08:11] the heavenly father
[2:08:13] truly I thank you Lord for all the
[2:08:15] blessings you've given

[2:08:19] pastor that cares about his people
[2:08:21] that cares about their finances it cares
[2:08:23] about their life Lord

[2:08:27] care about your sheep and I pray Lord
[2:08:29] that even coming down to the deacons and
[2:08:32] the assistance and the song leaders and
[2:08:35] all the all the ones that call this
[2:08:38] their church that we would truly be an
[2:08:40] example and

[2:09:36] everything that we do that we pray
[2:09:38] to you Lord and ask you Lord what to do
[2:09:40] and father we know that we need to have
[2:09:43] a tentative ear to hear what the spirit
[2:09:45] says to the churches a lot of
[2:09:47] forgiveness of our sins and our many
[2:09:48] mistakes Lord if anything said today
[2:09:50] Lord it was against you father I pray
[2:09:52] that you'd forgive us
[2:09:53] discount that is human heirloin but I
[2:09:56] pray Lord that we'll see that you are
[2:09:58] perfect Lord your word is perfect
[2:10:01] and then for the perfecting of the
[2:10:03] Saints there must be a word come Lord
[2:10:05] through the faithful Ministry could
[2:10:07] perfect us Lord
