[3:24] amen amen amen

[3:39] luigi
[3:40] no interpreters on the other side
[3:44] we'll all speak one language yes amen
[3:48] yeah
[3:50] you have to get rid of me
[3:52] listen to the southerners another day or
[3:54] two before you get used to it
[3:56] good to be here good to have each and
[3:57] everyone over here thank you for the
[3:59] ones that are participating and like i
[4:00] said before if the uh if the lord
[4:03] strikes you
[4:04] hit the water yes i believe folks ain't
[4:06] getting them before the devil dies
[4:09] brother brown never said somebody was
[4:11] too young
[4:13] never there's not a quote in the in the
[4:15] whole 1100 sermons where brother man
[4:17] said no you need to wait he said no get
[4:19] them to the waters back that's right
[4:20] amen and you know what
[4:23] they might not totally understand
[4:24] everything but you know what some of
[4:26] these that we're going to baptize may
[4:27] not totally understand everything either
[4:29] but it's an outward show of an inward
[4:31] work it's something somebody wants to do
[4:32] because of what's inside of them
[4:35] about the age of the child so let's read
[4:37] romans 6
[4:39] verse 1 says what shall we say then
[4:41] shall we continue in sin
[4:44] that grace may abound thank god brother
[4:46] mike brought all that wonderfully this
[4:47] morning yes
[4:49] god forbid how shall we that are dead to
[4:51] sin live any longer therein
[4:54] know you not that so many of us as we're
[4:56] baptized into jesus christ were baptized
[4:59] into his death
[5:00] therefore we are buried with him by
[5:02] baptism
[5:04] buried
[5:05] died buried resurrected all right that's
[5:08] what we're going to do today therefore
[5:10] we are buried with him by baptism into
[5:12] death that like as christ was raised up
[5:14] from the dead by the glory of the father
[5:16] even so we also should walk in newness
[5:18] of life
[5:20] for if we have been planted together in
[5:22] the likeness of his death we shall also
[5:25] be in the likeness of his resurrection
[5:27] knowing this that our old man is
[5:29] crucified with him
[5:31] and for the mighty was talking this
[5:33] morning the whole nature
[5:35] so nature is dead
[5:37] the old man is crucified with him that
[5:38] the body of sin might be destroyed and
[5:40] henceforth we should not serve sin
[5:43] for he that is dead is free from sin how
[5:45] many wants to be free today amen this
[5:48] whole weekend i wanted some people to be
[5:50] free as they could be yes and y'all
[5:52] worship man good job
[5:54] the lord was with us let's just keep
[5:56] that and continue and go on with it amen
[5:59] even back to our own homes take that
[6:01] anointing with you
[6:02] and worship god don't be afraid to
[6:04] worship the lord that's right he adores
[6:06] worship
[6:07] yes
[6:08] amen
[6:10] for he that is dead is free from sin now
[6:12] if we be dead with christ we believe
[6:13] that we also shall live with him knowing
[6:15] that christ being raised from the dead
[6:17] diet no more in death have no more
[6:18] dominion over him
[6:20] friend that he died he died unto sin
[6:22] once but in that he liveth he liveth
[6:24] unto god
[6:25] likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be
[6:28] dead indeed unto sin but alive unto god
[6:31] to jesus christ our lord let not sin
[6:34] therefore reign in your mortal body that
[6:36] you should obey it in the lust thereof
[6:39] neither yield you your members as
[6:40] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin
[6:42] but yield yourself into god as those
[6:44] that are alive from the dead in your
[6:46] members as instruments of righteousness
[6:50] unto god for sin shall not have dominion
[6:52] over you for you're not under the law
[6:55] but under grace
[6:57] like what brother mike said grace found
[6:59] us
[7:00] yes that's right we didn't go looking
[7:02] for gray
[7:03] grace found us and then all the efforts
[7:05] that we do this is an effort
[7:08] if you were standing in the water right
[7:09] now you'd say it was an effort
[7:11] but this is an effort but you know what
[7:13] it is
[7:15] it's going to clear it should clear your
[7:16] conscience
[7:18] to where satan can't say any more i need
[7:21] this and you're that no
[7:23] when we put that when we put you in the
[7:24] ground right here
[7:26] you leave everything behind you
[7:29] even if you're just justified even if
[7:30] you're just sanctified if you don't have
[7:32] the holy ghost that's okay start
[7:34] somewhere
[7:35] yes start right here just leave all
[7:37] those sins out here into this water
[7:39] they'll just go back to the devil and
[7:41] give them to you yeah but i want us to
[7:44] to be able to
[7:45] to see that and be free from all a lot
[7:48] of these things that we're that's
[7:49] binding us all all of us
[7:51] binding us to not move on with god and
[7:53] move on with the lord
[7:55] sincere and serious
[7:57] uh with the lord from now on so let's
[7:58] see
[8:01] um now listen uh
[8:03] we have four so far sister gwen

[8:48] he said go into all the world and preach
[8:50] the gospel
[8:53] find a miracle

[9:01] father and of the son and the holy ghost
[9:03] and we know that that's a
[9:05] that's a
[9:07] that's throwing it forward that peter on
[9:10] the day of pentecost he picked up the
[9:11] revelation he knew what jesus was
[9:13] talking about
[9:14] that father's not a name and son is not
[9:17] a name and holy ghost is not a name
[9:19] but he told us that the whole family in
[9:21] heaven would be named jesus christ
[9:24] so that's why we don't baptize the way
