[0:02] foreign
[0:13] God bless you thanks and good morning
[0:30] we sure enjoyed the um brother John
[0:33] Sunday School
[0:34] and uh appreciate him filling them for
[0:36] us
[0:37] and uh
[0:39] y'all just be in prayer for me the next
[0:41] three weekends I'll be we'll be I'll be
[0:43] going ministering so um
[0:45] fulfilling the Great Commission take the
[0:48] gospel into all the world so
[0:52] but yeah we just want to start with
[0:54] James chapter two
[0:56] um just read this scripture and then
[0:58] we'll kind of get into our lesson that
[1:00] says yay a man may say thou has faith
[1:02] and I have worked show me thy faith
[1:04] without thy works and I will show thee
[1:06] my faith by my works that I believe is
[1:08] thou that there is one God I'll do as
[1:11] well the Devils also believe in tremble
[1:12] but wilt thou know Will O vain man that
[1:15] faith without works is dead you know
[1:18] we're talking we're looking at Hebrews
[1:19] chapter 11 talking about faith and What
[1:22] a Wonder wonderful uh it's wonderful how
[1:25] God gives us a balance we'll start
[1:29] um brother Joe I I can't make it any
[1:32] bigger I'm
[1:33] sharing the slide let me see
[1:37] try it one more time
[1:39] oh there we go okay
[1:42] I'll match the wrong button I guess
[1:47] um so faith faith without works is dead
[1:49] God gives us a balance when we kind of
[1:51] get on it's toward one side of the of
[1:53] the road and start going into one side
[1:55] of the ditch and God will straighten
[1:56] this up and start going right down the
[1:58] middle so you say you got faith like
[2:00] like James is saying you've got faith
[2:02] well that's that's fine to say that you
[2:05] have faith but it's going to do
[2:06] something now I got this little picture
[2:08] on the side that uh that shows you know
[2:10] if you're if you really got the engine
[2:12] working and you've got gasoline in there
[2:14] and you've got the spark and it's firing
[2:16] away it's going to do something it's
[2:18] going and that's what your faith your
[2:19] faith is to do something it's going to
[2:21] produce a change in your life it's going
[2:23] to produce a change in your walk
[2:24] something's going to happen that's why
[2:27] the Bible says that signs and wonders
[2:28] follow them to believe now we're not
[2:30] looking for signs of Wonder that's not
[2:31] the thing that we're chasing after we're
[2:33] looking for the word but when you
[2:34] believe something will something's going
[2:36] to happen in your life
[2:37] and so faith faith without works is dead
[2:40] and brother Adam would say in the works
[2:42] that I do bear witness of me and that
[2:44] message that he preached in 1951 he said
[2:46] now I want to speak just a moment or
[2:48] just bring your attentions to a few
[2:49] words here that Jesus said at the works
[2:51] that I do bear witness of me now you
[2:53] think about what a great thing that the
[2:55] works that I do bear witness I mean you
[2:57] can see what type of man that Christ was
[3:00] as he lived that you just by looking at
[3:02] his life he would say he could make
[3:04] declarations about who he was and those
[3:06] kind of things but the works actually
[3:08] bore witness of who he was he said the
[3:11] things that I do what I say is what
[3:13] Bears record of me and that's what Bears
[3:15] record of every person do you know I'd
[3:17] rather you'd live me a sermon than
[3:19] preach me one it'll be a better evidence
[3:21] that you're a Christian isn't that right
[3:23] live a sermon and what we are is what we
[3:26] live what we do our actions shows what
[3:28] we are and if we say we have faith and
[3:30] then afraid to step out and claim our
[3:32] faith and put it to work then our faith
[3:33] doesn't do as much good does it
[3:36] the Bible said that faith without works
[3:38] is dead just as the body without the
[3:41] spirit is dead so Faith real faith is
[3:44] going to produce a living something
[3:46] something is actually working something
[3:48] that's doing not just something this
[3:49] just lays there something nice to look
[3:51] at and say well well we've got it no
[3:53] it's going to be something that produces
[3:55] now you think about that as we go into
[3:57] Hebrews 11 that Hebrews 11 is a great
[3:59] book a Chronicle a hall of Faith as Paul
[4:01] would say a cloud of witnesses in
[4:03] Hebrews chapter 12 he says a cloud of
[4:05] witnesses that we could look at and see
[4:07] examples of how when you believe it's
[4:09] going to produce you can see how it
[4:11] produced something when enables life
[4:13] that God actually Vindicated in Enoch's
[4:15] life he got up and started walking up
[4:17] and built a monument of his faith and
[4:19] walked off the Earth and Noah's life it
[4:22] didn't just sit there and he didn't just
[4:23] say well I believe that he'd actually he
[4:25] actually got up and started building and
[4:27] started producing and his faith was
[4:29] Vindicated because God
[4:30] prove that he what he said was right by
[4:33] rain falling on the earth like it is
[4:36] this morning rain
[4:38] rain coming down and so you you see this
[4:41] is Hebrews the whole book of Hebrews
[4:43] chapter the whole chapter of Hebrews
[4:45] chapter 11 is an example that faith is
[4:47] going to do something and verse 4 it
[4:49] says by faith Abel offered unto God a
[4:51] more excellent sacrifice than Cain by
[4:54] which he obtained witness that he was
[4:55] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[4:58] and by he being dead yet speaketh and
[5:01] let's just go to the Lord in prayer
[5:03] before we get to verse five Lord God
[5:04] we're so grateful to be able to gather
[5:06] here this morning we just absolutely
[5:07] your blessing on brother Wade is he
[5:09] studying and preparing that you'll
[5:11] prepare our hearts this morning for the
[5:12] word that you've got laid up for us to
[5:14] receive this morning we ask Lord to get
[5:16] your blessing upon the service in your
[5:17] name amen so verse 5 says by faith in
[5:22] Enoch was translated that he should not
[5:23] see death and was not found because God
[5:26] had translated him
[5:28] for before his translation he had this
[5:31] testimony that he pleased God and what
[5:34] was what was uh Paul laying out earlier
[5:37] that that you can't please God unless
[5:39] you've got faith so if you want to
[5:41] please God then have faith and so as
[5:43] we're coming to church and as you're
[5:45] listening listening to the word and
[5:46] reading your Bible your faith is being
[5:48] built up because and that's that's what
[5:51] that's what is going to be pleasing to
[5:53] God you think you think about how Enoch
[5:55] walked with God for 365 years
[5:58] yeah according to the Bible what the
[6:00] scripture says and and that all that
[6:02] time he he just kept walking kept just
[6:04] staying right with the word and you see
[6:07] that's an example for us for us in this
[6:09] day as brother Wade's preaching on the
[6:11] Statue of perfect man and coming up the
[6:12] Sun to the revelation of the son of man
[6:14] and all these things that that Enoch was
[6:17] a type of what we are actually doing
[6:19] right now now I I've got this Viewpoint
[6:21] you can see where uh it's a picture of
[6:23] where the capstone's supposed to come
[6:24] down on the pyramid and you can see all
[6:26] the the uh the where the uh the the
[6:30] stones they used to be that they took
[6:32] off that used to be laid on top of it
[6:34] where they uh there was 144 000 Stones
[6:37] all around over the pyramid that you
[6:39] could would actually reflect the light
[6:40] of the Sun that ever they say everywhere
[6:42] you look you can see like that The Gleam
[6:44] of this pyramid and it's actually a
[6:47] an example of what's of what we're doing
[6:49] today and the ten verges in the 144 000
[6:52] brother Raymond said oh God May someday
[6:54] the church which is a type of Enoch 500
[6:57] years you walk before God walking
[6:59] walking in the light with a testimony
[7:00] that everything God said he did it he
[7:03] didn't displease him what the Lord said
[7:05] do Enoch done it now if you think about
[7:08] your testimony this morning that if if
[7:10] God said do it you did it if God said to
[7:13] dress different you did it if God said
[7:15] be baptized you did it be baptized the
[7:17] right way God said be filled with the
[7:19] Holy Ghost you did it and all you can
[7:21] look back like Enoch did and see all the
[7:22] things that you did and that everything
[7:24] that you did was by faith and that God
[7:26] is pleased by the faith that you have by
[7:29] a revelation of who he is and and all of
[7:31] those things and then Enoch took us took
[7:34] a trip off the Earth
[7:36] but come with us to fulfill our all
[7:38] righteousness he said I can see Enoch as
[7:40] he knowed it was becoming to him for he
[7:42] was a prophet and he knew what was going
[7:43] to happen so I can see him kiss his wife
[7:45] goodbye and say darling I'll see you
[7:49] later take up his children and kiss them
[7:51] goodbye and go down to his married son
[7:53] and his married daughter and kissed him
[7:55] goodbye and it wonderful to have a
[7:56] prophet that can lay these things out to
[7:58] us and show these things that uh exactly
[8:01] how it happened kiss his married son his
[8:03] married daughter and kissed him goodbye
[8:05] and say where where are you going father
[8:06] are you going out for a little walk yes
[8:08] going for a stroll but he never took the
[8:11] old familiar path that day he took the
[8:13] King's Highway and he went on to glory
[8:15] and it was becoming him to do so he
[8:17] didn't want to leave now you think about
[8:18] that he didn't want to leave but yet it
[8:21] was becoming to him that he fulfilled
[8:23] all righteousness because he was a type
[8:25] of the church today he was a type of the
[8:27] church that's going to take an afternoon
[8:29] stroll one of these afternoons we're
[8:31] going to strike the King's Highway and
[8:33] Away we'll go
[8:34] and the true Easter seal brother random
[8:36] said they weigh tons and tons up there
[8:39] how they ever got them up that's still a
[8:41] mystery to man but they take this razor
[8:42] blade and can run along and it's so
[8:44] honed out so perfect until you can't
[8:46] even put a razor blade where mortar
[8:48] should be now that's what God is doing
[8:50] to his church he's honing off the people
[8:52] and making it in such a perfect way that
[8:55] when The Headstone Christ comes it fits
[8:58] the building together and then a
[9:00] resurrection of the whole thing the
[9:02] church is going up oh thank God that
[9:04] we've got the plan of how to get out of
[9:06] here that we can see actually what's
[9:08] happening in our lives as we as we come
[9:10] to church as we kind of go through the
[9:11] motions of life that God is building us
[9:13] up so that we can get out of here
[9:15] through a revelation of of who he is and
[9:18] all these things and why I'm against
[9:20] organized religion he said and that's
[9:21] the way God does the church he beats
[9:24] every Creed every denomination every
[9:27] man-made Dogma until he sees his own
[9:30] life reflecting in you right if I now
[9:33] there's that that scripture that I was
[9:34] reading earlier if I do not the works of
[9:36] my father believe me not see if what is
[9:41] purpose to the church the life that was
[9:43] in Christ isn't reflecting in you don't
[9:46] you stand still if you haven't got
[9:48] patience virtue all these things and
[9:51] Temperance and things and godliness and
[9:53] brotherly kindness and all these things
[9:56] that's required of you so think about
[9:58] that this morning that this required of
[10:00] you to have these virtues in you and
[10:02] brother Brown will say in another place
[10:03] that if you don't have these virtues and
[10:05] it becomes a stumbling block to the
[10:06] belief why is it a stumbling block
[10:08] because if you say you have faith and
[10:10] then all these things are not on display
[10:11] then it creates a question in somebody's
[10:13] mind why are you flying off the handle
[10:16] why do you not have to why are you not
[10:18] tempering why are you why you get so
[10:20] upset with somebody and not able to deal
[10:23] with somebody it creates a confusion
[10:25] because people are expecting the works
[10:27] of Christ to be on display if you say
[10:30] that you're a Believer faith that's
[10:32] where the The Works The Works of my
[10:34] father are these things right here on
[10:36] that that we're talking about the word
[10:38] what is it it's Christ actually on this
[10:40] play in you in the body of Christ and
[10:43] when you come to church you want you
[10:44] expect to see Christ you expect to see
[10:46] Christ in The Believer and you think
[10:49] about what brother Brown was saying here
[10:50] he says no matter what you've done no
[10:51] matter how much you've shouted how many
[10:53] churches you've joined how many feathers
[10:55] you've panned into yourself
[10:57] don't do it wait till genuinely from
[11:00] your heart oh think about what he's
[11:02] saying now a real Holy Ghost Field
[11:04] believer can forgive somebody wait till
[11:07] genuinely from your heart you can
[11:09] forgive till in your heart you have
[11:11] brotherly kindness
[11:13] no matter if they pull a handful of
[11:15] beard from one side you can turn the
[11:16] other cheek with sweetness see until
[11:18] those virtues no matter what they say to
[11:21] you no matter what they say to you
[11:24] that God's God's given us the the recipe
[11:27] to achieve this by his word as we
[11:29] receive the word it's actually changing
[11:31] is to make us to make us like him to
[11:34] make us be like Jesus so you think about
[11:36] you think about the higher you go up
[11:38] that pyramid I've got a little picture
[11:39] here of a young man that climbed that
[11:41] pyramid illegally and he got up there
[11:43] and he he sat on the top and you think
[11:45] about when you get up you it changes the
[11:48] way that you view things it changes you
[11:51] think about what he's saying here until
[11:52] you can forgive in your heart that you
[11:56] have brotherly kindness that you can
[11:57] look on somebody differently maybe than
[12:00] you did when you were down you just got
[12:02] born again and you were looking maybe
[12:03] with a critical eye and maybe all you
[12:05] could think about was about whether
[12:07] somebody had a Christmas tree or not and
[12:08] you're just ready to criticize criticize
[12:10] but the higher you go up it changes your
[12:13] Viewpoint where you're now you're
[12:15] looking at other people that now you're
[12:17] realizing they're going through a a
[12:19] journey themselves and that the same God
[12:21] that took you through your journey is
[12:23] able to take them through their Journey
[12:25] because he promised that the spirit of
[12:26] truth will lead and guide you into all
[12:28] truth so if he took me and led me to
[12:30] where I am that he's able to take you
[12:32] and lead you to where you are and that's
[12:34] what Peter was talking about the second
[12:35] Peter when he said but he that lacketh
[12:37] these things is blind and cannot see
[12:40] afar off oh God wants you to get up high
[12:42] that's what that's what he got divorced
[12:44] that John heard come up higher he wants
[12:46] you to come up higher so you can see
[12:48] things differently the higher you go the
[12:50] more the more love you can show with the
[12:52] other person the more grace you can show
[12:54] the other person things look a little
[12:56] bit different when you get up higher you
[12:58] cannot see a far off if you don't have
[13:00] these virtues but he that lacketh these
[13:03] things as blind and cannot see afar off
[13:05] and have forgotten that he was purged
[13:07] from his old sins oh you think about
[13:10] somebody way down at the bottom maybe
[13:11] they're they're kind of getting started
[13:13] and they they're all they can think
[13:14] about is well you you just you're
[13:16] something wrong with you and something
[13:17] wrong with you but when you get up
[13:19] higher you remember how God delivered
[13:21] you of your own sins and you can show
[13:22] Grace to somebody else Grace that's why
[13:25] it's Grace Grace Craig great crying
[13:28] Grace To The Headstone Grace where you
[13:30] can show Grace to somebody else and
[13:31] minister to somebody else with love and
[13:34] show them a little bit of Grace and
[13:35] kindness kindness
[13:40] let's keep going with this study so so
[13:43] the Bible says by faith Enoch was
[13:45] translated that he should not see death
[13:47] and was not found because God had
[13:49] translated him for before his
[13:51] translation he had this testimony that
[13:52] he pleased God but without faith it is
[13:55] impossible to please him for he that
[13:57] cometh to God must believe that he is
[13:59] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[14:01] diligently seek him uh you you think how
[14:04] you when you read the Bible you've got
[14:06] to read it in context so you could
[14:07] isolate that scripture where he's
[14:08] talking about that Enoch please God and
[14:10] say how do I please him but just keep
[14:13] reading that by faith without faith it
[14:16] is impossible to please him so with
[14:18] faith you can please God
[14:21] and believe in God brother Adam said now
[14:23] if we are born of our Heavenly Father
[14:25] God who calls those things which are not
[14:27] as though they were there's got to be
[14:28] something in us like that see that's the
[14:31] reason that a real consecrated Christian
[14:33] that's all out for God looks to what God
[14:36] Said instead of what you see or feel
[14:38] that's the Earthly man there if we walk
[14:41] in the flesh we can't please God we walk
[14:45] after the spirit
[14:46] you think if you're if you come to
[14:48] church living by faith that you're not
[14:50] looking so much even to please the other
[14:52] person or the other you're not maybe
[14:53] even to please the minister but you're
[14:55] looking to please God and that's when
[14:56] something will happen if you if you want
[14:58] to please God and make sure that God is
[15:00] Happy Look to Him and look to his word
[15:02] instead of all the circumstances and all
[15:05] the things around like like Noah did
[15:07] when he just ignored all the
[15:09] circumstances like Abraham did when he
[15:11] ignored the circumstance of his life and
[15:13] where you know all like no Moses did
[15:15] when he got to the Red Sea and the
[15:18] Egyptians were on his tail and and the
[15:20] Red Sea was before him and he just he
[15:22] just looked to what God had promised
[15:24] instead of all the things that he could
[15:27] observe by his natural eye my brother
[15:29] Adam said in diseases and afflictions he
[15:30] said you can't have anything from God
[15:32] Only By Faith by faith the walls of
[15:35] Jericho failed by faith Moses Refuge to
[15:37] be called the son of Pharaoh's Daughter
[15:39] by faith to Gideon did so and so by
[15:42] faith the only way and without faith is
[15:44] impossible to please God and if you want
[15:47] to please him you must come to him with
[15:49] faith believing his word is truth
[15:54] brother Adam said when you are saved God
[15:57] gives you Faith to rise from the muck of
[15:59] the earth your faith overcomes the
[16:01] things of the world what is your faith
[16:03] your faith is that act that God has did
[16:06] in you to make you a Son of God oh to
[16:10] think about that this morning that faith
[16:12] is not just just studying something and
[16:14] not just being educated but faith is
[16:16] actually something Supernatural in your
[16:18] life he said you quit your line you quit
[16:20] your stealing you quit your drinking
[16:22] because your faith Rises you up above it
[16:25] if you don't do it you don't have any
[16:27] faith and by faith are you saved and
[16:30] that through Grace and he said as much
[16:32] as you think about this as much as your
[16:34] faith will be released that's how much
[16:37] power you can have now you you think as
[16:40] you're studying the message you think
[16:41] about all these things that brother Ryan
[16:42] said to build our faith that all these
[16:44] things that Paul is saying all the way
[16:46] up leading up to Hebrews 11 and closing
[16:48] out with Hebrews 12 and 13 was to get
[16:50] you to believe that there is nothing
[16:52] impossible with God if you can believe
[16:54] it if you can believe it you can speak a
[16:57] world into existence and go live on it
[16:59] and there is nothing impossible and
[17:01] nothing means nothing nothing nothing
[17:02] there is nothing impossible with God if
[17:05] you can believe it if you can believe it
[17:06] God will put that pocket knife in your
[17:08] pocket if you can believe it he'll make
[17:10] the little keychain move if you can
[17:12] believe it your family can be set in
[17:13] order if you can believe it you'll get
[17:14] the Holy Ghost there is nothing
[17:16] impossible with God if you can believe
[17:18] it a little faith is as a grain of
[17:20] mustard seed will move a mountain if you
[17:23] can believe it if you can move it
[17:24] believe it the Red Sea will be parted
[17:26] the Egyptians will be destroyed all
[17:28] those things that have been trailing you
[17:30] that you've got problems with what all
[17:32] your life maybe all addictions and
[17:35] things if you can believe it it'll be
[17:36] it'll be destroyed just like God destroy
[17:38] the Egyptians
[17:40] God dwells in you and you are Sons and
[17:42] Daughters of God there you are but it's
[17:45] your faith Jesus said according to your
[17:47] faith be it unto you if thou can't
[17:50] believe all things are possible verily I
[17:54] say unto you if you say unto this
[17:55] mountain be moved and don't doubt but
[17:57] believe that what you have said all
[17:59] things are possible
[18:01] that's why even the song that brother
[18:02] Brown said it said that's saying in his
[18:05] ministry was only believe all things are
[18:07] possible because he wanted people to
[18:08] believe that it didn't matter whether
[18:10] they had cancer in their body it didn't
[18:11] matter if they had uh problems in their
[18:14] minds it didn't matter it all things are
[18:16] possible if you can believe
[18:20] and he said you could speak a word into
[18:22] every present water from The Rock he
[18:24] said you could speak a world into
[18:25] existence and go live on it there you
[18:27] are that's what power is in the church
[18:29] now but it is controlled by a law let's
[18:31] see what kind of law he's talking about
[18:32] it's controlled by law and that law is
[18:35] not keeping a bunch of Commandments it's
[18:37] not just like an intellectual idea like
[18:39] Cain say thought or Esau when they came
[18:41] trying to come with their intellectual
[18:43] idea what the message of that day was
[18:45] it's a law of faith
[18:49] faith Jesus said all things are possible
[18:53] to them that believe
[18:55] and if you can believe it whatever God
[18:58] will lead your soul to believe that is
[19:01] yours
[19:03] the whole to think about that this
[19:04] morning if we could just grasp it
[19:06] if you can believe it
[19:09] whatever you need is yours every place
[19:13] The Souls of your feet foot can set upon
[19:15] by faith God gives it to you it's yours
[19:19] you possess it if you can find the key
[19:22] to this law of faith that opens it to
[19:26] you oh that's what Paul's talking about
[19:28] in Hebrews chapter 11. now you can
[19:30] believe it something's going to happen
[19:31] if you can believe it there's going to
[19:32] be Works following there's something
[19:34] something will be demonstrated where
[19:36] people can look at your life and see
[19:38] there's a real belief where people can
[19:39] look at the evidence the evidence of
[19:41] something happening in your life because
[19:42] faith will produce something it'll do
[19:44] something and that's what that's what
[19:47] Paul is talking about as we keep going
[19:48] he said by faith Noah being warned of
[19:50] God of things not seen as yet moved with
[19:53] fear prepared an ark to the saving of
[19:56] his house
[19:57] by the which he condemned the world and
[19:59] became heir of the righteousness which
[20:01] is by Faith by faith Noah got up and did
[20:05] something he believed God enough to
[20:06] start building on that Ark and uh
[20:09] there's there's so many things that you
[20:11] can study here that the three pools of
[20:13] what Noah was doing and so forth and so
[20:15] on but by faith Abraham when he was
[20:17] called to go out into a place which he
[20:19] should have received an inheritance
[20:21] obeyed and he went out not knowing
[20:23] whether he went by faith he'd sojourned
[20:26] in the land of promise as in a strange
[20:28] country dwelling in Tabernacles with
[20:30] Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of
[20:33] the same promise for he looked for a
[20:34] city which hath foundations whose
[20:37] Builder and maker is God you think now
[20:39] would that have been faith if Mo if God
[20:41] talked to Abraham and he just sat there
[20:43] in the land of shinar or wherever he
[20:45] started off from and just just sat there
[20:47] and and said well God told me he maybe
[20:50] say I believe the message I believe what
[20:52] God told me but no James is telling us
[20:54] it's not Faith unless you get up and do
[20:56] something because faith is going to
[20:58] produce works and Abraham started on his
[21:01] journey and started started started
[21:03] looking for the city that God promised
[21:05] him
[21:06] right and we'll get we'll get to it here
[21:08] in a minute that Abraham was looking for
[21:10] a city that he never got to but we it
[21:12] Paul as Paul lays out in Hebrews chapter
[21:14] 12 we have come to the Mount Zion we
[21:17] have come to the New Jerusalem we've
[21:18] come to the to what all those things
[21:20] that that the Old Testament saints were
[21:22] looking at for we have come to those
[21:24] things
[21:25] and then the only ones at the end time
[21:26] brother Brown said what is faith faith
[21:28] is something that's revealed to you that
[21:30] is not yet but you will believe it but
[21:33] but you believe it will be faith is a
[21:36] revelation of the will of God
[21:38] so by revelation
[21:41] it was a Abel got the revelation of the
[21:45] will of God when he offered a sacrifice
[21:46] that the right kind of a sacrifice not
[21:49] just fruits from the field but he
[21:50] offered a little lamb and Noah got a
[21:53] real revelation of what God wasn't going
[21:55] to do and you think about God can give
[21:57] you a revelation of his will that will
[21:59] inform where you should go and how you
[22:01] should act and what church you should go
[22:03] to and who you should marry with the
[22:05] rebel a revelation is the will of God
[22:09] so by Revelation and the churches today
[22:11] don't even believe in spiritual
[22:12] Revelation they believe in a dogmatic
[22:14] teaching of some system by Revelation
[22:17] Abel offered unto God a more excellent
[22:19] sacrifice than that of Cain which God
[22:21] testified he was righteous
[22:23] I hope you see that see where we're
[22:25] living see the hour I was talking to a
[22:26] gentleman not long ago a Christian
[22:28] scholar and gentleman he said brother
[22:29] Branham uh Mr Brandon we refuse all
[22:32] Revelations I said then you have to
[22:34] refuse Jesus Christ for he is the
[22:37] revelation of God Amen God revealed in
[22:40] human flesh and unless you see it you're
[22:44] lost
[22:45] but to the church he said in the Rapture
[22:47] the bride the Rapture is a revelation to
[22:49] her it's revealed to her that the
[22:51] Revelation the true bride of Christ will
[22:54] be waiting for that Revelation for the
[22:55] Rapture it is a revelation for the
[22:58] Revelation is Faith you cannot have a
[23:00] revelation without it being faith faith
[23:03] is a revelation because it's something
[23:05] that's revealed to you faith is a
[23:07] revelation faith is something that's
[23:10] been revealed to you like it was to
[23:11] Abraham that could call anything
[23:13] contrary to what had been revealed him
[23:15] as though it wasn't so now Faith that's
[23:18] what faith is is the revelation of God
[23:22] the church is built upon a revelation
[23:27] the whole entire
[23:30] excuse me
[23:32] the whole entire body
[23:36] but he said oh how we need Revelation by
[23:38] the spirit
[23:40] we don't need a new Bible we don't need
[23:42] a new translation though some are very
[23:45] good in the musicians can go ahead and
[23:46] come forward
[23:47] some are very good and I'm not against
[23:49] them
[23:50] but we need the revelation of the spirit
[23:53] and thank God we can have what we need
[23:56] for God wants to reveal his word to us
[23:59] by his spirit
[24:00] aren't you glad he said that thank God
[24:03] we can have what we need and God bless
[24:06] your Saints
[24:07] [Applause]
