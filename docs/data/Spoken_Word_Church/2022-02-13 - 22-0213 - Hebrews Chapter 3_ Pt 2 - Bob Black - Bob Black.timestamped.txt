[0:02] god bless you saints
[0:05] yeah like you said monica's doing
[0:07] wonderful so i appreciate your prayers
[0:10] and your and your calls and all of those
[0:12] things we sure appreciate we sure
[0:13] appreciate having to pray in church
[0:18] so last time we were we were looking at
[0:20] hebrews chapter three and uh
[0:23] got down to about verse five let's just
[0:25] go to the lord in prayer real quick
[0:26] before we go into the word lord thank
[0:28] you thank you so thankful lord to be
[0:30] able to come together this morning to
[0:32] look into your word and i pray god so
[0:33] just strengthen us now lord edify us by
[0:36] the things that we read lord and
[0:38] give us give us courage to fight this
[0:40] battle lord and we pray lord that you'll
[0:41] be with brother wade as he prepares lord
[0:43] for the morning message in the name of
[0:44] the lord jesus
[0:47] now um
[0:48] so so hebrews chapter 3 verse 5 says and
[0:50] moses verily was faithful in all his
[0:52] house as a servant for a testimony of
[0:54] those things which were to be spoken
[0:56] after
[0:56] but christ as the son over his own house
[0:58] whose house are we if we hold fast the
[1:00] confidence and the rejoicing of the hope
[1:02] firm unto the end so paul is talking
[1:04] about building a house and christ is the
[1:06] one that's that's that's building a
[1:09] tabernacle for himself to live in and
[1:10] that's what he talks about in first
[1:12] corinthians
[1:13] for we are laborers together with god ye
[1:15] are god's husbandry ye are god's
[1:17] building according to the grace of god
[1:19] which has given them to me as a wise
[1:21] master builder i have laid the
[1:23] foundation and another build of their
[1:25] own but let every man take heed how he
[1:27] build with their opponent
[1:28] now you think about all these kind of
[1:30] hard to be understood things that paul
[1:32] lays out that he's he's actually laying
[1:34] out all the materials and laying out all
[1:36] the frameworks so that this house this
[1:38] tabernacle can be built down through
[1:40] seven church ages everything that we
[1:42] preach this goes back to what the things
[1:43] that paul
[1:44] told us about and
[1:46] because god's god's trying to build a
[1:48] building that that so that he can
[1:50] tabernacle in
[1:52] now but now
[1:53] paul gets into here he's he begins to
[1:55] warn us he begins and the major theme of
[1:58] the next the rest of the chapters is
[2:00] watch out
[2:02] that you don't do like the children of
[2:03] israel when they were coming out of
[2:04] egypt
[2:05] because they failed to believe
[2:07] everything that the prophet that that
[2:10] their prophet moses told them they
[2:11] failed to believe
[2:13] the promise that god had promised that
[2:15] they were going to be able to go into
[2:16] the promised land and and reap the
[2:19] rewards
[2:20] so if we go to the next slide
[2:22] hebrews uh chapter 3 verse 8 says harden
[2:25] not your hearts as in the provocation
[2:28] and the day of temptation in the
[2:30] wilderness
[2:31] when your fathers tempted me proved me
[2:34] and saw my works 40 years
[2:37] now you you really when you begin to
[2:39] meditate on the things in this chapter
[2:40] it's very it's very scolding it's it's
[2:43] it's kind of harsh
[2:44] the things to to consider are you know
[2:47] you begin to consider uh are
[2:49] are we
[2:50] are we failing like like like they
[2:52] failed
[2:54] and so paul says wherefore i was grieved
[2:56] with that generation and he's quoting
[2:58] and said they do always air in their
[3:00] heart and they have not known my way so
[3:02] i swear in my wrath they shall not enter
[3:05] into my rest
[3:07] now what provocation means provocation
[3:09] is when you it's something you do to
[3:11] make somebody real annoyed or angry so
[3:13] that children of israel they were
[3:14] annoying they were getting making god
[3:16] upset you think about all the things
[3:18] that god did for them showed them a
[3:20] pillar of fire part of the red sea and
[3:22] gave them water from a rock and manner
[3:24] from heaven and all the different things
[3:26] and yet they failed to believe when they
[3:27] came to going over into the promised
[3:29] land they failed they stopped and failed
[3:31] to believe that god was able to give
[3:32] them what what is the promise the
[3:34] promise is the baptism of the holy ghost
[3:37] now if we go to the next slide
[3:40] brother evan said they heard it they
[3:42] heard it but they didn't believe it
[3:44] god come down he showed them a pillar of
[3:46] fire showed by his prophet signs and
[3:47] wonders he was with him they didn't
[3:49] believe it
[3:50] oh they like to see the miracles they
[3:52] like to hear the prophet
[3:53] so you you go to a church service and
[3:55] and they and they start saying well god
[3:57] sent a prophet and everybody rejoices
[3:59] they believe they believe as far as
[4:00] believing it
[4:01] but he said but as far as believing that
[4:03] they didn't
[4:04] their lives prove they didn't now he
[4:06] said don't you fall after that same
[4:08] example of unbelief or in this last days
[4:10] to the gentile church
[4:12] god has appeared again same sign same
[4:14] warner same pillar of fire vindicated
[4:16] proven let us not harden our hearts and
[4:18] fall in that temptation back yonder of
[4:21] unbelief full will rot on earth and
[4:23] that'll be all of it
[4:25] now if we go to the next slide he said
[4:27] let's stop here a minute
[4:28] the provocation when they provoked
[4:32] now what did god do
[4:33] now paul is trying to speak let's go
[4:35] down to the next highlighted
[4:37] verse
[4:39] paragraph 121.
[4:40] he said no god had his people with
[4:42] unsettled rest
[4:44] they were down in egypt
[4:46] they were out of their right position
[4:48] they were out of their homeland
[4:50] what was our homeland the promise of the
[4:52] baptism in the holy ghost
[4:55] now now that that that means different
[4:58] something different depending on where
[4:59] you are in your journey
[5:01] and i'm gonna get into that
[5:03] they were strangers and pilgrims and god
[5:05] was going to bring them from that housed
[5:07] in place
[5:08] in egypt up to the homeland
[5:12] a title today we're unsettled
[5:14] here it don't take long little chubby
[5:16] handed boys playing marbles little girls
[5:18] with the dollies playing the first thing
[5:19] you know you got gray hair and wrinkled
[5:21] up there's something wrong here now now
[5:23] he's see he's talking about he's talking
[5:25] about a born-again christian
[5:27] that there's something wrong but we're
[5:29] going somewhere
[5:31] we're going somewhere what are we going
[5:33] to we're going to adoption we're going
[5:35] to a body change so we're in a journey
[5:39] he said there's something wrong here
[5:40] this is not home we're in the wrong
[5:42] place that's why we say we are pilgrims
[5:45] and strangers
[5:46] something's happened we gotta we gotta
[5:48] get somewhere
[5:50] so don't do like them in the provocation
[5:52] to disbelieve
[5:54] now now we gotta to to really this
[5:57] really to sink home we've got to
[5:59] understand where we are you remember and
[6:01] when you young people you go to the mall
[6:03] back in the day when people still went
[6:05] to malls and malls were open
[6:07] they'd have a big kiosk at the front
[6:09] that said
[6:10] you are here in the mall or if you maybe
[6:12] you go to a theme park and you look at
[6:13] the map and it says you are here so you
[6:15] can know where you are so this this this
[6:17] story maybe won't make as much sense to
[6:20] you if you don't understand where you
[6:22] are today in this story
[6:24] now
[6:25] and so let's go to the next slide
[6:27] now think about this now meditate on
[6:30] this where where are you in this story
[6:32] you're in you're in this somewhere
[6:34] now the children of israel coming out of
[6:36] egypt they were coming out of egypt and
[6:38] they went through the wilderness and
[6:39] they were going to the promised land and
[6:42] now now you now we can compare that with
[6:44] justification
[6:45] sanctification
[6:47] and the baptism of the holy ghost
[6:49] so you're you're going through this
[6:51] place of sanctification on the way
[6:54] to a promise
[6:55] that god has given to you
[6:57] so you're in the middle of this journey
[7:00] and all these things are happening
[7:01] there's so much so much happens in that
[7:03] state of sanctification because that's
[7:05] where you're packing the word in and
[7:06] you're you're trying to keep the
[7:07] candlesticks lit and you're you're at
[7:09] that altar of incense praying and things
[7:11] happen and you've got to repent and
[7:13] you're trying to trying to trying to
[7:15] live a christian life and things are but
[7:17] you're on your way
[7:18] to the promised land
[7:20] now where we can kind of get mixed up is
[7:22] when you think well i'm already born
[7:24] again
[7:25] so that doesn't apply to me anymore and
[7:27] there's where you miss the picture you
[7:29] missed the big picture
[7:31] of of where you are in that story
[7:34] if you're sitting here this morning and
[7:36] you think sanctification no longer
[7:37] applies to you anymore anymore then
[7:39] you're let's let's get into the depth of
[7:41] the message what the message really is
[7:43] let's go beyond now now you're born
[7:45] again
[7:46] we got to go somewhere
[7:48] now let's if we go to the next slide
[7:49] let's kind of look at the at the road
[7:51] map god gave us a road map in the old
[7:53] testament that we can look at and you
[7:54] get you got in on the outside the outer
[7:56] court your sacrifice has been offered
[7:59] and you put your hands on the bloody
[8:00] sacrifice and to identify yourself with
[8:02] it
[8:03] and you're washed and baptized at the
[8:04] labor and then you're as as part of your
[8:07] to show justification that christ died
[8:09] for your sins and that you go on into
[8:12] into sanctification where you got the
[8:13] three the three the the table of
[8:15] showbread you where you open up your
[8:17] bible and you're studying and you and
[8:19] you've got the candlesticks where you're
[8:21] you're trying to keep them lit and they
[8:23] go out and it gets foggy in there and
[8:24] you're trying to keep them lit and
[8:25] everything but then finally you go into
[8:28] the baptism of the holy ghost where the
[8:29] word begins to open up to you and the
[8:31] life of christ begins to live in you and
[8:33] now that now the word is beginning to be
[8:36] real to you he gives you his faith but
[8:39] that's not that's not the end of the
[8:41] story
[8:44] so now now now let's get a little bit
[8:46] deep here
[8:47] because you got to understand where you
[8:49] are for this story to make sense the
[8:52] story of the provocation in the
[8:54] wilderness because if you think that
[8:56] that sanctification doesn't apply to you
[8:57] anymore then you won't be able to
[8:59] understand
[9:01] this story correctly
[9:03] so let's say you you're
[9:05] you you you go you've gone uh
[9:08] you've gone through this journey
[9:09] justification sanctification baptism all
[9:12] the ghosts now you're inside i gotta
[9:13] stay close to the microphone you're in
[9:15] inside the holy of holies but now now
[9:17] what you gotta do something happen
[9:19] that's personal to you but now what
[9:21] happens is you come out
[9:23] to share with their other people now
[9:25] you're you've got a life that's got to
[9:26] be put on display now you go to church
[9:28] and you can show so it's like you're
[9:31] coming out you're coming out to share
[9:33] with others what happened to you on the
[9:35] inside there
[9:37] so then
[9:39] now after that that that your journey
[9:41] started now you're going through like
[9:44] phase two now let's look at that on the
[9:46] on the next slide
[9:48] so you go through justification
[9:50] sanctification and baptism in the holy
[9:51] ghost
[9:52] and now
[9:53] you're going back you're on a journey
[9:55] just like the children of israel again
[9:57] you're going back through a higher level
[9:59] of sanctification where every day every
[10:01] day things need to be cleansed out of
[10:03] your life and and and and it's the
[10:05] baptism of the holy ghost it's the holy
[10:07] ghost that's doing it in your life it's
[10:09] cleaning you out as these virtues are
[10:11] added to you
[10:13] to make you live and walk like christ
[10:15] and when where are you going to what are
[10:17] you going you're going to a place of
[10:19] adoption where god can can actually
[10:21] begin to open up the seals to you and
[10:23] get you to a place where he can open
[10:25] things up the way that he wants to
[10:28] now why what happened at baby form
[10:30] justification he's trying to get you to
[10:32] a place where he can he can put his own
[10:34] life in you and now once he's done that
[10:38] he wants to get you to a place where he
[10:39] can open up the word the way that he
[10:41] really wanted to
[10:42] he wants to and that that comes at
[10:44] adoption he wants to he wants to get you
[10:46] to a place where you can understand
[10:48] christ the mystery of god revealed and
[10:49] and who is this melchizedek and what the
[10:51] seven seals are and be able to look back
[10:53] and understand the path that god that
[10:55] journey that god has taken you on and
[10:57] then once it gets to to get you to an
[10:59] adoption then he wants to get you to a
[11:01] place where he can he he can open these
[11:03] things up to you you think about
[11:05] you think about jesus christ there at on
[11:08] when he went up to mount transfiguration
[11:10] and and a voice from heaven said hear ye
[11:12] him but then
[11:15] then you find out christ was there in
[11:16] the garden of gethsemane crying out to
[11:18] god let this cup pass for me so there's
[11:21] still even after you come to adoption
[11:23] there's something something else that
[11:24] has to take place a dying out to the
[11:26] flesh
[11:27] of dying out so that you think about
[11:30] christ there in the garden of gethsemane
[11:31] what if he had said
[11:33] you know what i'd rather i would rather
[11:35] just go take a wife and just live my
[11:38] life out and not die on the cross then
[11:40] he could have done that but yet he would
[11:42] have never come to that place where he
[11:44] rose on easter morning and his body was
[11:46] changed
[11:47] there's got to there's got to see after
[11:49] even after you come to adoption you
[11:51] there's another you continue through
[11:53] that process right
[11:55] you see why brother brown
[11:57] he he he would preach through the all
[11:59] these sermons about this pattern of the
[12:01] justification sanctification and the
[12:04] baptism of the holy ghost and it goes
[12:05] beyond just just being just being born
[12:08] again
[12:09] and you see that's why you've got to
[12:10] understand what happened in the as they
[12:12] were coming out of out of egypt through
[12:14] this wilderness journey it's it's more
[12:16] than just just being born again and so
[12:19] now now brother branham in the in the
[12:21] intervale
[12:22] in 1956 he said that that in this place
[12:25] where you dwell on the inside the secret
[12:27] place with god there's a difference in
[12:28] their look he said there was three lives
[12:30] that led man
[12:32] there was three lives that lead man
[12:34] today
[12:35] the first thing there was three stages
[12:36] of the manner three state what are we
[12:38] talking about three stages there's three
[12:40] stages of everything
[12:43] there was three stages of everything
[12:45] there's three stages of your experience
[12:48] now look you can see that in all through
[12:50] the scripture you can see elisha had
[12:52] three stages of his experience when he
[12:55] followed elijah
[12:57] david had three stages of his experience
[13:00] he was he was anointed by samuel then he
[13:02] was anointed by the tribe of judah then
[13:04] he was anointed by all of israel to be
[13:06] king they all had three stages and you
[13:09] got three stages of your experience
[13:11] everybody in the all these types and
[13:13] shadows show in three stages
[13:15] now now let's take this let's take this
[13:18] just maybe so you can see
[13:20] take what that slide we just we just saw
[13:23] and let's rotate it
[13:25] so now you can see the ladder that
[13:27] you're climbing up let's spin it on its
[13:29] side and see what that looks like
[13:32] let's go to the next slide
[13:34] so you go through justification
[13:36] sanctification you're in that wilderness
[13:38] you're on a journey so so what what's my
[13:39] point my point is this story will mean
[13:42] something different to you
[13:44] based on where you are in your journey
[13:47] so if you're if you're not born again
[13:50] you're on that bottom rung
[13:52] you're in a place where you're going to
[13:54] church but you're not born again here
[13:56] and you're you're you're looking for
[13:58] that promise of the holy ghost
[14:00] that god can put his life in you and
[14:02] make the word begin he can begin to do
[14:04] the believing and do the living you're
[14:07] you're you're on that way to the journey
[14:09] and if you fail to believe the ministers
[14:11] and if you fail to believe the word
[14:12] you'll never make it to that to that
[14:14] bowling experience
[14:16] but now what if you're born again
[14:18] now what if you're born again now you're
[14:20] going through the wilderness again
[14:22] and you're on your way where you're on
[14:23] your way to adoption
[14:25] you're on your climbing up and if you
[14:27] fail to believe what the prophet said if
[14:29] you start grumbling and complaining with
[14:31] the ministers and how hard it gets to be
[14:34] a christian sometimes and you begin to
[14:35] murmur at what god has given to you and
[14:37] murmur at how hard sometimes it is to
[14:39] understand the word like
[14:41] you know maybe baby they did back there
[14:43] when when paul would say things hard to
[14:45] be understood murmur and complain how
[14:47] are you going to get to adoption
[14:49] then once you've got to adoption
[14:51] once you got to adoption
[14:53] how are you going to get to a body
[14:54] change except you believe the word
[14:56] that's been preached so you're depending
[14:59] on where you are in your journey that
[15:01] story will mean something different to
[15:03] you that's why that's why even when you
[15:05] come to church everybody hears something
[15:07] different
[15:08] depending on where you are you different
[15:10] people will pick on different things
[15:12] pick up on different things that are
[15:13] said and you can actually here
[15:15] understand where somebody else is in
[15:17] their journey by what they'll echo back
[15:20] sometimes i i heard what you were
[15:21] preaching or or different you know
[15:24] they'll people pick up on something
[15:26] different
[15:27] based on where they are in their journey
[15:30] now now
[15:31] if we go to the next slide brother adam
[15:33] said an adoption he said there was three
[15:34] stages of the journey and there's three
[15:37] stages of this journey
[15:39] we are justified by faith
[15:42] believing on the lord jesus christ
[15:43] forsaken the land of egypt come out
[15:46] and then are sanctified
[15:48] through the offering of his blood washed
[15:50] from our sins and become pilgrims and
[15:51] sojourners claiming that we are seeking
[15:53] a land a city that's coming or a promise
[15:56] i hope this maybe means something
[15:58] different to you now that he's not just
[15:59] talking about just being born again he's
[16:02] talking about you're on the journey
[16:04] so did israel in the wilderness
[16:05] sojourners no place place to rest
[16:08] traveling night after night following
[16:10] the pillar of fire but finally come to
[16:13] the promised land
[16:15] where they settled down
[16:17] now what's the promised land for you the
[16:19] promised land is a new birth or the
[16:22] promised land is adoption the token the
[16:24] true baptism of the holy ghost or the
[16:26] promised land
[16:28] is a body change
[16:30] so it depends on where you are in your
[16:32] journey
[16:33] now
[16:34] no place to rest now if we go to the
[16:36] next slide let's think about think about
[16:38] coming to that place of sanctification
[16:41] and all that work you've got to do in
[16:43] there in that holy place
[16:44] constantly tending to the candlestick
[16:46] constantly at that table of that table
[16:49] of showbread opening up the word and and
[16:51] studying and eating and eating and going
[16:53] to the altar of incense and saying god
[16:54] forgive me for what i've done
[16:56] because you're working toward that
[16:58] you're not you working let's restate
[17:01] it's the holy ghost and you work
[17:03] bringing you to a place
[17:04] of rest in the in the in the holy of
[17:07] holies
[17:08] that's why he said no place to rest
[17:10] traveling
[17:11] night after night like the children of
[17:13] israel in the wilderness traveling
[17:16] following the pillar of fire but finally
[17:18] come to the promised land where they
[17:19] settle down
[17:22] so in that wilderness in that wilderness
[17:24] journey there's a lot of provocations a
[17:26] lot of things there was a lot of profit
[17:29] a lot of things that they did to provoke
[17:31] god and a lot of things today that we
[17:34] can do to provoke god
[17:36] just like they did so let's look at some
[17:38] of them provocations then doubting god
[17:40] was with him you think about them with a
[17:42] pillar of fire with them knowing that
[17:44] god was leading them that god was with
[17:45] that man and yet they doubted that god
[17:47] was with him how could we could we be
[17:49] guilty of the same thing today you know
[17:51] what brother wade's back there studying
[17:53] the message when he comes out do we
[17:54] doubt that guess god's speaking to us
[17:56] that do we doubt that that that the man
[17:58] of god is speaking as of the oracles of
[18:00] god
[18:02] do we do we disbelieve god's servant
[18:04] just as they did back then are we
[18:06] dissatisfied with the man and we begin
[18:08] to think that it's boring just like they
[18:09] did and
[18:10] wish for something a little bit wish for
[18:12] something a little bit more exhilarating
[18:14] something maybe so that we could be
[18:16] entertained some a little bit more you
[18:18] know you wonder sometimes if maybe it
[18:20] would maybe church would go better if
[18:22] the preacher would come out juggling and
[18:24] riding a unicycle or something because
[18:25] we we don't get entertained by the word
[18:28] as much we the the word if we if we
[18:30] really see the word as as our life
[18:33] then it becomes
[18:35] it
[18:38] we don't look at our circumstance and
[18:39] things so
[18:40] much like like back then he said look at
[18:43] looking at circumstance instead of the
[18:45] promise
[18:46] and looking back to egypt
[18:48] looking back to where they had been
[18:50] delivered from
[18:51] you know as cr if you're a real
[18:54] christian if you're a really really see
[18:56] where you're headed to then you you stop
[18:58] looking at all that all that
[19:00] the muck in the mire from where you come
[19:02] from and and uh all the makeup and and
[19:05] bad clothes and all that stuff it it
[19:07] loses its appeal
[19:09] and see that's where they begin to doubt
[19:11] they begin to doubt god's word they
[19:12] begin to look back and and wish that
[19:14] they were still back in egypt to even to
[19:16] a place where they were like i wish i
[19:18] wish that we would have died in egypt
[19:20] now you think you think about somebody
[19:21] that would make a statement like that
[19:23] and then look around you in this day and
[19:25] you can see people doing the exact same
[19:27] thing leaving the message and going back
[19:29] to egypt going back to the because you
[19:31] can't leave the message and retain your
[19:33] standard of holiness
[19:35] you can't leave the message and continue
[19:36] to be holiness
[19:38] doubting what god was able to honor his
[19:40] word
[19:41] or saying i know a better way of doing
[19:43] it
[19:44] now you think you think what you think
[19:46] about
[19:47] god what god gives us is revelation
[19:51] revelation the revelation of his word
[19:53] that's what we're after
[19:55] and see when you see a man come out from
[19:56] behind the pulpit and and and and give
[19:59] something that's a deep a show a deep
[20:02] understanding a deep understanding of
[20:04] the word that shows that he's got an
[20:06] understanding of life he's got an
[20:08] understanding of supernatural life and
[20:10] then when you say within your heart well
[20:12] i think i know a better way of doing it
[20:14] jesus said i am the way the truth and
[20:16] the life
[20:17] so if you know jesus you know the way
[20:19] and there's no way a better way to do
[20:21] anything than jesus christ
[20:23] you see how they begin to doubt they
[20:24] begin to want they begin to think that i
[20:26] know better a better way to do things
[20:28] than moses i've got a better way of
[20:29] doing it i've got a better way and
[20:31] people begin to you know but subvert in
[20:33] the church and think i i've got a better
[20:35] way of i i know a better way to do
[20:38] different things in the church than
[20:39] brother wade does or whatever
[20:41] i'm just being i'mma be plain
[20:44] be playing brother bob
[20:46] provocations today doubting god is with
[20:48] us or doubting the prophet in the
[20:50] ministry doubting being dissatisfied
[20:52] with the word or
[20:54] keeping one foot in the world or
[20:55] thinking you know better way or doubting
[20:57] it is possible for god how about this
[20:59] doubting that it's possible for god to
[21:01] to reveal the word to you
[21:03] doubting that it's possible for the
[21:05] seals to be open you know many times
[21:07] we'll come into church and we'll get so
[21:08] cabbage down and we think well i just
[21:10] don't know if it's possible
[21:11] because the word seems difficult but if
[21:13] you'll just keep pressing on press on
[21:16] the word god will open up i i i you know
[21:20] just just to get a little bit personal
[21:22] i've studied many nights until i just
[21:24] come to a point of exhaustion because i
[21:26] want i don't want to get up here and
[21:28] just
[21:29] say
[21:30] say uh empty words but i want to know
[21:33] what i'm talking about
[21:34] when you come to a place where you you
[21:37] you you press you get desperate
[21:39] something will happen god is able to
[21:41] reveal his word god is able to open up
[21:44] the word to you today
[21:47] so what will they do when they were
[21:49] wondering in the wilderness if we go to
[21:51] the next slide in the wilderness of sin
[21:53] for 40 years that's what that will the
[21:55] wilderness of sin wilderness of unbelief
[21:57] because the unbelief
[21:59] now you think when they came out of
[22:00] egypt they really only had a really
[22:03] short journey to the promised land and
[22:05] the point i'm trying to make is it
[22:07] shouldn't take you long to get born
[22:09] again you think sometimes it should take
[22:11] me a really long time to give being born
[22:13] again is really easy god wants to give
[22:15] it to you more than you want to give it
[22:16] to yourself
[22:18] and also he wants to adopt you
[22:20] now now the thing the reason they
[22:23] wandered around in the wilderness was
[22:25] because of their unbelief but if you'll
[22:28] bulk it down and get serious with god it
[22:30] won't take you long to come to a place
[22:32] where god can use you it won't take you
[22:35] and you see the same thing it won't take
[22:36] you long it won't take the church long
[22:39] to take a body change if we'll really
[22:40] get serious with god and buckle down and
[22:43] and get in the word and find out what
[22:45] god wants us to understand the reason
[22:48] why they wandered and wandered and
[22:49] wandered and wandered for 40 years
[22:51] instead of making a quick little trip to
[22:53] the promised land was because of their
[22:55] unbelief
[22:57] now brother brahm said a little
[22:58] something can raise up instead of going
[23:00] to write to the scripture and find out
[23:02] whether it's true or not oh you say oh
[23:04] no
[23:05] that's what he said no see there you go
[23:07] ahead i'll just continue a presbyterian
[23:09] like i am see go ahead blind and you
[23:12] provoke god when god does anything
[23:14] he expects the nation to grab it
[23:19] but instead of that you know well i
[23:21] don't know about that
[23:22] is that how we do sometimes when maybe a
[23:24] little bit hard preaching this preach we
[23:26] go we go to sleep because we don't want
[23:28] it we we don't come to church because we
[23:30] don't want it and that's our unbelief
[23:32] working our unbelief is on display when
[23:34] it when we don't grab it
[23:36] grab it you got to take the kingdom by
[23:38] force you got to come to church with a
[23:40] desire to get your blessing and the
[23:42] musicians can go ahead and come forward
[23:44] see he expects the people to get it
[23:48] if you're concerned enough sit down with
[23:51] the scripture if you're concerned enough
[23:53] you'll get as close to the front as you
[23:55] can if you're concerned enough you'll
[23:56] pray and seek god you'll use your idle
[23:58] time to get close to god if you're
[24:01] concerned enough
[24:02] and we'll in on that god bless you
[24:06] [Applause]
[24:18] you
