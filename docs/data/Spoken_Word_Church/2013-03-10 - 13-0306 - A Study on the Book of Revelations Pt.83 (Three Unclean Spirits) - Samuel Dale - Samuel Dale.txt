scriptures from where we've been reading in Revelations one and we'll be in Revelations 16. it'd be hearing good have a good Wednesday get ready for the next weekend to come well that's what they say Wednesday's far you know I remember the Lord willing the ministers meeting will be at brother Bill Yachts is coming weekend and we'll be leaving probably five o'clock in the morning or something to try to get up there and it looked like it may be snowing so you know they closed down just about this week right so you know we'll see how it goes we won't leave if it's real bad but if there's no problem with the Lord would it all right remember brother Claude why singer will be here with us preaching Sunday right remember the fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday remember your time changes this weekend and we thank the Lord for finding brother Donnie's book that we were praying where they had left it in the Jeep well that was we thank the Lord for that right I'm glad to have it you know when you ask the Lord and then you see him show you where things are or take you to them and that's wonderful thing to be doing amen any other announcements I don't really forget something let's spray before we read our scripture the heavenly father we thank you this night for an opportunity to just take a little time off in the middle of the week yes and to just sit down and think about you and your word and what you've already revealed to us and the hour that we're living and truly Lord if anybody could ever see the day that they're living surely we can because we see it unfold in the natural and we see it in the spiritual we see all the things taking place around the world and everything getting ready We Just Praise Your Great Name if we just come among us tonight and open your word to show yourself unto us and speak to our hearts that we may walk in the light of Your Love forgive our sins and lead us by thy Grace in Jesus name Revelations 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he said and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John because by record of the word of God under the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand and now let's go over to Revelation 16 re-read where we're at because we haven't finished this part yet going on down into Armageddon inherent this evening to we took part of it Sunday morning but when I go on all right Revelations 16 13. and that's all three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouths of the dragon out of the mouth of the Beast and now the mouth of the false prophet all right now we know that the dragon is wrong the Beast is the power you know the the the the power of of that Rome and then the false prophet is the pope right around explaining those things unto us we'll read in just a minute for they are the spirits of devils working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and if the whole world together them to the Battle of that great day of God almighty behold I come as a thief blessed is he that watches and keepeth his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame and he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon you may be may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we were covering our Sunday and trying to you know emphasize some pains on this uh three unclean spirits like frogs the prophet said it went out of the mouth of someone when we read there in the scripture where it does and and what it is is the same Doctrine all right so then we found that natural Rome which was you know hedonistic many gods Etc then it was converted into papal Rome and papa wrongdin came up with the trinitarian concept you know and if not fully three Gods into the point of God and treat persons blessing Trinity you know and coming out to be the same Trinity and then we saw that that they were three uncleans these three unclean spirits like frogs coming out as I said now naturally it comes from Rome natural wrong right over into Apple wrong all right then we're into the things and we'll get a little bit more than Lord willing the next message into the the old mother and the Harlot daughters and see the denominational situations and and life and seeing that trinitarian concept coming over that started at nicaea you know and develop into the Trinity Doctrine in the Christian realm you know of as we would call it coming down into the realm but then the prophet said after the opening of the seals that it would come out that they would be that part of a new Trinity in the end time amen that's right all right and I I made a lot of emphasis and a lot of things our Sunday about you know that the people of this message are the ones to me that the they're the three unclean spirits like frogs that are teaching contrary to the prophet's message Amen in all forms and ways and and coming after that and I want to apologize for making that statement that you know it was brought to my attention that wasn't too nice when I said if somebody tried to convert me to the basis of of believing that brother Branham was deity then I'd spit in his face and walk away well I just wouldn't spit this but it's okay with you take that away and just take that stiff and face that didn't sound too good just emphasizing the point of how much I'm against that right right good word that you know and I told the man we were up in Jeffersonville and we were talking and standing there and the man was a deity believer and I said now and I pointed to another man I said if you believe he's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Brown had the baptism of the Holy Ghost and not dealing with the gifts and the signs and the things that within the prophet's Ministry but I said if you'll say that Holy Ghost in him is deity right because run around and said those things and I said if you'll say that's deity then I'll go along with you with deity and brother Brown he said oh no oh no we'll see that you know you can understand that those things are not right but just put that down to my ignorance of of uh what how was it Ronald Reagan got by with it he just didn't remember maybe 72 I get to where I just can't remember now I was trying to emphasize it so hard when I used the wrong words I shouldn't have said I'd spit in his face I said I should have said I just turned walk away right all right but let's go on because I believe that amen I believe that out of the message of the hour that after the seals broke then you didn't see any of the doctrines you know you saw a few little things taking place while the prophet was here but once he left the scene then you struck our day really because coming along and during the in 66 and hearing of the message and hearing of all of the things that was going on then and they was trying to figure out then well who's to lead the bride who's to be the Elijah who's to be the the uh the uh Joshua to take us through and you know and I tried to tell them in I said well my understanding was that run around come to introduce the great one yep amen and that was the Lord Jesus Christ I mean that's that's what I believe you know and I don't think there's no greater it could be introduced and I don't think the human mortal other than Jesus Christ that you could have anything greater than brother random's Ministry and his life and his dealings with the things to bring us to work but he said after so you come down to the mouth of someone it's the same old Doctrine you just moved from natural Rome the Pagan many gods well brought around said like he said when they come on over and he said then they couldn't go on with just you know with with one God so they had to start changing it and then made it into a pre-god theory you know or God injury person's Theory right and and bringing that in and it developed that nicaea when they begin to come along at 606 you see it really becoming prevalent you know and and all like that and and then you know going through and bringing into the Trinity Doctrine but then you see after the message broke go ahead and pull that one up brother uh Anderson 240 paragraph 244 of the anointed ones you remember there Sunday we were bringing out that brought around says that there was three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth you said gay paragraph 241 said gave birth to a new Trinity from their mother and the things and to be after the seals would come forth and this is what he said he started work it's false prophet singular see there twice it's the the what the three unclean spirits like frogs what it now the dragon Rome the Beast is the power or whatever coming and then it develops into the pope that's why it's the first this is this is false prophet singular false prophet the first pope and from dark came out and the and the mother of harness the whole thing a false Trinity was Rising not in the early days wouldn't be made manifest in the early days it went right on through with it see it went right on through with it it was dark but when the Seven Seals become and opened those Mysteries and reveal them that's when the frogs three unclean spirits like frogs come out to manifest themselves Trinity Doctrine against the right truth right so then it come out to be in this message is where you've got the Trinity Doctrine to coming out to face the truth because we believe the message was the truth right man see this this message is the truth so then when you come out like that it comes out of the mouth of someone someone has to teach it you know so I'd have to teach a doctor that's right oh you know you can have ideas or whatever but someone must teach that and bring it into a Doctrine and that's why you got stages it's come down you like you you've got the Deeds of the Nicolaitans then you got the doctrines and Nickelodeons and then it becomes a law it becomes this out or the other and it's the same old Trinity just brought up a little higher into the message people and I'm sorry about that I'm not I I love the brothers and the people but I thank God for the truth amen I thank God that he's opened my eyes to see things to worry that I can look and see those things and not throw it off on nobody they're wonderful wonderful brothers and the difference between you and I and the others out there it's one time God chose to reveal his word right you better thank God for that every day of your life amen then I chose to reveal himself to you that's right man that don't exalt us into a great big state it humbles us down to realize that what we get the Bible said somebody gave it to you right you say I studied this out while the Holy Ghost gave it to you amen the prophet had already bought it somebody put it in book form and done this out of the other you know and gave it to us but thank God for the truth right all right it comes out of the mouth of someone and as it's coming out of the mouth of someone it's a doctrine that people teach you all right and see then you can see all of these doctrines you know two Souls seven Thunder virtues and all of that um you know two Lords uh River Jordan doctrines no Holy Ghost doctrines all kind of things come out against the truth but they didn't dare stick up their head until the prophet left to say yeah right now here's what the prophet of God said one day and I thank God for it he said I believe it's in the church age book of 99 sure I'll find it he said I'm wanting to wait for a time to people to do like they did and turn around and say you are not saying what Paul said amen right right and look people straighten the eye and say you're not saying what brought around talked right okay and you'll see you become very unpopular you know because you're you're standing for the truth well thank God that there is a little bride that will stand for the truth all right but see in her then we'll be revealed and made known the real true secrets of of life and all and you know and take us even into a change but now watch this in a minute because we're going to get on to the natural form of what is known as Armageddon a great battle that the Bible we read of here this to come in the end time and we notice bringing out Sunday that verse 13 through 16 is a breach placed in you know and what it's doing is like we covered in the seals that there's a breach that you know in the church ages there was a breach see then something is made known dire and that Bridges you across all right now I told you that I'd choose to go through the vows and plagues of these things here of chapter 16 I didn't choose to do that because it is already covered in the opening of the CEOs in the tribulation period and the things like that it's already covered so I didn't choose to go through but I want to emphasize one thing to you that will read it and look at it you read down through chapter 16 and you get up to your sixth vow you know the plague and when you do it in it you see that great things are the the kings of the north that would dry up and brother Brown said Euphrates is where they would need to come down through from a lot of these things of looking at today and he said God will dry that up to where the kings of the North and the things can come down through Euphrates comes but I don't think he's talking about just drying it up because that would we don't worry about that anymore we just get to the water we go across it I think his emphasis is the point that he was making above her when he said that Euphrates runs out of Eden yes right all right but another statement he made if you want me to give it to you I'll be glad to pull it up he said and the same Euphrates runs through Babylon I don't think he's emphasizing the driving up I don't think the Bible is emphasizing the drying up of of the water you might have had to have done that in the days when you needed to come across the horses and chariots and that's basically the riding back there but we're in a day when we don't have to worry about it we can fly over and everything else but I think the point he's trying to make is that that River comes out of eat out right straight out of Eden right and then it'll come right straight down and it comes to Babylon right so that would put the two you know the beginning of the truth of it the good and the Babylon that will get into mystery Babylon Lord willing in the next message I think that's more what he's emphasizing for us to do but see this new Trinity is going to lead the people to the battle of Armageddon right now I'll read that to you in a minute this new Trinity that's going to lead the and you you can call then the new Trinity as I said here's old religion here's new Trinity come out from the old Rome into the Catholic Church comes over into protestantism to be a new Trinity but then come on over in our day to be a new Trinity come out after the opening of the seal but wherever you place it we'll read the quote in a minute where the Prophet says that new Trinity is going to set to people your Armageddon yep now that's the emphasis I want us to make tonight for us to look at because I mentioned it Sunday and I preached on this many times before but to those that haven't heard it we will get down to it in a minute in a reading because when I first read it he would be talking about you know Armageddon okay and and I thought he was going to tell us about how these Russians was going to come down and he said they will right in the Dead Sea alone when we were over there in Israel the Dead Sea alone contains trillions or trillions of dollars of untapped minerals and resources for the resident to come down through there for the uranium I was looking at that a moment ago and see coming down we know they're going to come down there for oh right right you know that's the main thing today is the oil to get it because right in that area is where all the oil that if you go back and read a little bit of your natural newspapers you'll find out that the battle in Kuwait was to secure that area right now I read this out of the newspaper worded even for 50 years they'd have a right to run a pipeline across there right and that was what the whole war was about see we think it's about this that or the other now it would just you know it was that point to get that area to where we could have our hand holds our what do you think Russia is doing the Bible says when you see Jerusalem compassion about on all sides yep but around said the East and the West is gathering together reading these today thinking I I would just quote them but bringing the East and the West together well to circle around Jerusalem right and you look at it Russia Here China here we're here who's over here what's known all coming in the end time the one right around and brought it down to the fourth seal talking of Armageddon he never named those Nations like that he showed us where the forces would be coming from that's right because remember the Trinity is what's going to sit right we'll read that in a minute where he said the Trinity is going to set Armageddon into being in other words that's the thing that's going to draw down to make it come to be called Armageddon where it can be that Basin all right now so let's start and just get some natural things but I want you to take that now and think about it he doesn't cover Russia and China and the United States that will take place we know that right that will transpire because you've got to have those but like I said World War one they had on their Buckles in God we trust on both sides you know see we don't want to think about battles but what about the the great civil war here in America when brother was fighting brother right you said but brother damn that wasn't over a religious matter huh I would beg your pardon all balance has been fought over a religious manners right you might not want to call them religious you know yeah yeah but it's all been religious matters it's somebody's idea contrary to somebody else's idea right right and that brings all of the battles but let's just read a little bit and just with that emphasis in mind and then just think about what he's saying let's go to number one brother Anderson let's see what the prophet of God has to say I love this quote because of of the layout of the way it comes down this is uh questions and answers uh real four or part four 1964 8 30 in the evening paragraph 75. you talk about the ending the broadest call we're already entered into that's what they were saying they were saying the church age ending blacked out see thinking when the seals broke everything was over with and everything but that was their question we have already entered into the tribulation period that's why they were thinking he said no no no you're I wish that I could just have more time on that see the bride when she's taken from the church then the church eggs will cease the people in the message today and I'll go a long way up to a degree of a point but a lot of people are saying the seventh Church age has already ended when I it can't end until we get out of here I mean we're calling caught out of the age but the age still goes right on over and it actually goes if you connect it let's see what church eggs will go right over and connect against with the the tribulation and over to the Jews but you see that's what people will take their own ideas of a thought he said but when the bride is taken then the church age receipts letting you see it goes into chaos the bride goes to glory now look at the order one two three four me yep and the tribulation period sets in upon sleeping a sleeping virgin for three and a half years while Israel is getting its prophecy then tribulation sets in upon Israel and then comes the battle of Armageddon which destroys all things then the bride returns back with the groom for a thousand years I love the order of that thing look the millennial Reign after that comes to watch on judgment after that comes the new heavens and the new Earth and the new city coming down one after the other if you ever want to do that just write that down and if you want to know the order of events okay just read them yep the prophet is giving it to you let's see showing where Armageddon will take place Israel will be getting good prophecy then the tribulation was set in upon Israel of course everybody don't believe that Daniel 70 weeks message but that's all right see the battle of Armageddon will come now the battle of Armageddon will be a a decisive battle and it's also um it's called in what is it megadon or something is the other name for it you can look it up in your Hebrew idea but you know but just think about it what is going to take place the bride has already gone in the rapture so she will have nothing to do the tribulation sets in all things has nothing to do with the literal Armageddon so that will be the the termination of forces with Israel all right now let's go and read a little bit more with this read a whole bunch and then we'll back up and start our talk look at the next one Victory Day preached in 1963 a 421 paragraph 127. we talked about it we've had several Wars wars and rumors of wars and d-days and V days and V days and he'll finally wind up into the great battle of Armageddon that'll be the life of it when she comes to the battle of Armageddon that'll settle the whole thing just before when now when does Army get in take place just before the great millennium Armageddon is to clean off the Earth so you re-purifies yourself with this Atomic blowing and the volcanic action the thing sinks this soaked blood of men and upon the Earth and sin and crime and seeing and all it'll come in in the earth cleanses the Earth for the great Millennium he cleanses his church burning bringing her to that before the great Millennium that's what Armageddon is going to do all right Armageddon is going to set a stage to where the Millennium could take place amen it will be a termination of forces it will be an end of Wars until you come down to goggin Magog and we'll read in a minute where the Prophet says Armageddon is but before the Millennium goggin Magog is after the Millennium there's two great battles in the Book of Revelation and two now let me back up what I said a minute ago when you insert this arm again you can come from the sixth vowel all right and when when you read your sixth vowel I'm gonna do my glasses there we go the six mile is the 12th verse of the 16th chapter and the sixth Angel Port is vile up on the Great River you break these in the word Arrow was dried up right let the way of the kings of the East might be prepared he says me so forgive me for saying North America all right because we've always said to Kings of Illinois you know but look see when you breach this end you showed it really Armageddon is going to be the breached cross if you're reading in your Bible to look at it in verse 17 and the seventh angel poured out Israel into the Earth and there came a great voice out of the Temple of Heaven from the throne saying it is done and there were voices and Thunders and Lightnings and there was a great earthquake and watch ending the tribulation right such as was not since men were upon the Earth's Almighty and earthquake was so great then you're going down to where there'll be Stone's nail falling away as much as 200 pounds but what I'm saying is Armageddon shows you what will will bring about this ending up of all things naturally of the battles and then God shows you what he's going to do right he'll come down and fight for Israel right it'll be natural battles and natural bombs falling to end this whole thing up and that'll be Armageddon but see then God's going to bring a great earthquake to end the whole thing says greater than any of them has ever been but see that's that's where we look at it and we see what's going on all right now go ahead with number three set the mark of the beast and seal of God number two 61 to 17 paragraph e42 notice the very next verse the 12th and 13th verse blessed are the dead that die in the Lord what's the next Armageddon blessed are they that die in the Lord Armageddon church is gone then after this third Angel's message all right go to the next look just tiny in that scripture about the blessing or they that die in the Lord this is paragraph 83 of the 70th week of Daniel 61 806 paragraph 83 them prophets will prophesy 120 three score days which is in the midst of the last week of the Jews then they're cut off and the Armageddon sets in has nothing to do with us right nothing to do whatsoever with the bride because she's gone into glory in the Rapture amen but it will be to Israel and it'll be in the tribulation and they come to that place and the prophet said they prophesy and in the midst of the last week of the Jews then what's going to happen Armageddon forgive me paragraph 215 of the same message Daniel and watch these two or three prophets or two prophets when they raise up here and in the middle of the week they're cut off I'm doing this just to place to where someone out there especially looking into hasn't read these things to place the order of Armageddon it is not after the right to rapture it is at the end of the tribulation period right right real happy years is all the tribulation there is to Israel amen excuse me when they rise up here and in the middle of the week they're cut off like that then starts the battle of Armageddon did God begin to speak himself there he stands and begins to fight that profits are striking the Earth they're preaching the name of Jesus Christ watching they're baptized in the same way you remember the other day I was talking about what message they were going to get when we leave out here being this message all right they're going to baptize them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they're not going baptize and fall asleep they're doing the same thing that the first man across the fathers did and many are following them but who but that who's confederated that organization moved right on down and watch you picking up the organized religion now the power of those prophets didn't break it it doesn't break that power oh the old mother do those two Prophets they're they're going to be so powerful it's going to take the Israelites and make them kill their own people 144 000 to do with him they said we'll make it all an organization and he brings in what is it the Abomination romanism to overstret the spread the whole thing that makes a desolation and it takes everything into it all right placing the order of timing of what it's to be of Armageddon then we'll see and read in a minute let this the prophet just read we'll read what he says about the battle of Armageddon right but just placing it together to see this is taken from from thy house reached in Tifton Georgia 1961-808 paragraph 74. here's what I think it'd be now he's back up here explaining you know coming down and and the communism uh winds up and he told us you know don't fear communism but it is three Spirits just like communism fascism read another one in a minute where he names them calling it fascism communism one jump in Catholicism right now I want you to Anchor that one good because he said those three see you stop at saying audience in communism but remember communism is gone so you don't lost your point now Russia's not gone communism is gone right it's all those three are going to wind up in Catholicism we'll get down to that in a minute so here here's what I think it'd be I believe it's the spirit the sleeping virgin Confederation Church Judaism only rejection of Christ the Jews is rejected and Catholicism because you see where it comes out of and it come out of the false prophecy out of the mouth of the false prophet which was potpourri from out of the Beast see and all that were it come out of you can see the back background where you know where it is and that's the three unclean spirits that sets the whole world to Armageddon now he doesn't bring Natural Forces right he's not talking about Russia Wants to Rule the World he's talking about those three unclean spirits like frogs is going to lead the entire world to the battle of Armageddon right amen that's what I want you to see I'm wanting us to get away from the fact of even thinking about well boy communism is this and this Islam is that communism is gone Russia's not gone no right but communism is gone where did it go but eventually that goes into Catholicism you say no Russia is not Catholic they have a lot of religious people in Russia there's people in this message in Russia bringing the truth to them nurse imagine this Baptist Presbyterian all kind of churches and in China they have them I think I'm writing a quote won't quote them but they call it the three self church or something like that yeah in other words it's the one recognized by the government but it's massive this this Baptist it's Presbyterian it's Pentecostal this but they just put them under one my point is when you see it really see the battle of Armageddon you're going to get away from bombs and airplanes and things happening and you're going to see it setting right now in order that's my whole point setting an order because you know where it's setting in your mind and my mind that's right that's why I tried my best to bring our Sunday a little bit in advance to talk about the spiritual battle of Armageddon that's going on now and me and you right where they're trying to pull us into denominationalism you wouldn't surprise me none whatsoever if some of them had already applied to the World Council of churches to try to get membership in with this message this message is growing by lips and brown boundless millions and millions now right right in this message especially in the foreign field right right see you've got this thing going a few more years we're going to be listed as one of the as big as a lot of the denominational churches are I didn't say that all right I said if this thing goes on the way it's going thank God there'll be a Bride come out of it amen because we got to come out of the church right amen amen that's right amen come on there's a church but there's a bride called out of a church right now amen all right so where are we at look what he says on the next one now they're just placing the arm again ask him this question or question answered on the seal 63 324 in the morning service paragraph 341 would you please explain how Satan has bound a thousand years being loosed again for the Battle of Revelations 20 and 8 Revelation 20 and 8 is Gog and Magog all right watch it this is not the battle of Armageddon Revelation 28 and the eight that's that's not the battle of Armageddon that's what he's explaining the battle of Armageddon takes place on this side before the millennium we all right at the wind the tribulation period is ended you know what relation does it with the Battle of dog and mega none one is this thousand years on this side of another word the other one is is the end of the end of the Thousand Years in other words after the Thousand Years okay you got Armageddon coming first and then you got Gog and Magog we'll get to that as we get on over further in the The Book of Revelation but placing it in order to where you won't misunderstand it watch what he says about now how this will talk start taking place go ahead with number nine because I left out eight okay that's my fault nope we had this already worked out Sunday because that's with my note Sunday this is taken from the United common sign 63 818 paragraph 89 it'll go on down into the 91. because they're right now uniting you said brother Brown was that true they're coming to the battle of Armageddon exactly what they will do see and they're uniting for that right now that's why we got the U.N and everything we have the Western worlds uniting against the Eastern World communism and so forth It's all uniting together the churches are uniting together everything's being united united themselves together go ahead and pull them up the paragraph 91. God is uniting his bride she is coming together for the East and the west and North and the South there's a uniting time and that's on right now what is she uniting for now these others who you're not needing to go to Armageddon right she's uniting for the what the Rapture amen God's getting her ready yes sir uniting what is she uniting with with the word for all the heavens and earth will pass away but my work shall never pass away she's unite herself with thus said the Lord regardless of what any denomination or anybody else said she's uniting herself see that's going on right if we can see these others going on why can't we see what's going on in you and I right that's the point of reading is she's getting ready why she is the bride that's right and she's uniting herself with her bridegroom see and the bridegroom is a word in the beginning was the word word with God and the Word was made flesh and dwell among us all right so what are we doing if we can see a natural thing transpiring why can't we see what's taking place tonight all right amen amen well why can't we see the greatest battle ever fought being fought right now right here in our brain you see the people of this message trying to enroll with every kind of doctor it could be thought of that's right there's no new doctrine to everyone come out of Genesis that's what you're talking about just like we've showed you that the one where they're talking about now that Jesus wouldn't go out to the River Jordan that's identically what they were arguing at the First National Council whether Jesus was God or Alexa that's right you see we're we're battling this we're uniting to the word is correcting our era right amen right all right but that Trinity of unclean spirits that's trying to bombard us to get us to go is also inflicting in every nation in the world right right sure to bring the world to Armageddon amen we're not going to beat our arm again we're going to go up in the Rapture amen at least a three and a half year period before Armageddon takes place but see the battle is going on now that's what he said to you and that's what they're doing you should know that you you energy to try to stop Wars we're never stop one right I'm not against it I love America man but where if you ain't ever stopped the war and why is it when they want to do it we're always number one at goals right right amen so it shows that we're the as we were saying here a while back what we are the image to the Beast right amen we are the ones with enough military power to control the world because we got the bombs we got the planes we got everything ready all right but now what's it doing she's uniting and what's this next one Mr Nick which is ashamed 1965 711 paragraph 2 23 224. and the spirit is not only in America he's talking about these three unclean spirits he's talking about all of the things that's happening how the world is falling down with the Rick Ricky's and the ricketters and the all of the things and the spirit is not only in America it has spread itself out over the world to bring them to the battle of Armageddon they act like that whether they are or not all the whole world and you know what the biggest portion of the world the reason they act like that is because we went in there and took into their nation and their country our thoughts and our ideas and we converted them and we freedom yeah we put the women in The Honky Tonks and the beer joints and yeah right line them up with a man made them equal right right I mean am I saying anything is wrong no and we're trying to convert the world of what so there must be something in the back of us more than just us because we don't want that so it must be that Reagan and the pope got together and destroyed communism that's what paper said the music the night the magazines here right well we kept running the arms race up we kept even falsifying it when we didn't even have the things right so that Russia would keep building and building when they did they demanded payment if they had a demanded payment that day of us we ain't broke too right amount the reason they didn't demand is because we are the one with the mark of the beast right all right but you see what I'm talking about together them together now bypass number 11 because we've done registration Revelation 16 16 and he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon now let's just take this a little bit and let run around them just do this jump over to number 12. let's go into the fourth seal and just read and then you just make up your mind about it yourself as we let him say to us this time this is paragraph 26 278 of the four seal 63 321 and what is this all coming to now we just got about 12 14 minutes here I guess look what is this all coming to what is it it's going right back the way it did it started in heaven it's coming to the end time battle the first thing in heaven was about Lucifer was kicked out and come to the Earth and any polluted Eden then he's been polluting ever since and now from the battle in heaven is coming down to the battle on Earth it needs to be finished on Earth at the end time in a battle called Armageddon everyone knows that the battle started in heaven holy and so they kicked him out Michael and his angels overthrowed them just run out and when they did drop right down and eaten and here started the battle down here right amen all right now what kind of a battle did it start it didn't start a communism and the catholicisms and I mean the communism and Nazism and all of those were this Humanity coming down Nations developing where was the first Babylon in heaven right where was the next battle at in the mind of Eve right right in the mind of Eve and you know it's odd isn't it that we lay so much emphasis upon Armageddon being more into the spiritual mechanism of bringing together the the world to a Catholic Doctrine when you think about what happened in the garden went straight to the mind of Eve you'll be as God knowing Good and Evil you be able to talk to God because you'll have an understanding like him knowledge all wars has been thought over religious matters of one form or the other did I say it one country wants to take over another country because they want to Captivate them they want to get them under their domain and their gods right the Egyptians with many gods wanted to capture the Israelis and make them Egyptians right under their gods all battles in the world has fought over religion Cain and Abel started it out over religion right that's true yep amen fighting over a Doctrine don't worry about run around says don't you fear communism then he said Don't Fear Russia he said there's no place in the Bible that will ever show you that Russia will rule the world right now we know that in the Bible Russia will destroy because they're going to be part of the element of forces in the last days right right but that's not the main thing where did the battle start in the garden where did your Prophet say it's greatest battle ever followed what did he say he said it started in the garden in the mind of man and see what is it that you can have a religious matters and people of different countries both of them will be uh hedonistic governments but you have to go over and Conquer another government to try to convert them to their hedonistic ways and now come on folks I'm not backing up I'm going home America going to the world to try to convert the heater into the heat in America some of those rules and customs and logs that some of those countries has Beats us to death whether you like that kind of talking or not it does yep see we try to free countries to make a war we can give them religion what do we give them into this madness Presbyterian Pentecost I told you when I was in the Baptist Church I knew then the Baptist Association was sending money to incite rights and governments in foreign countries come on of course they couldn't get into that country we talk about the people of this message like that we've just barely got an inroad into China back what 10 years ago or something yeah yeah well you see the reason we got an inroad into China 10 years ago because the message that some Baptist doesn't eat us there probably 20 years ago or more than that right see it's setting up as I read to you a moment ago the prophet would say then that what these three unclean spirits like frogs going out of the mouth of someone a Doctrine is going to bring the whole world to Armageddon right now I want you to think a moment about this now just don't I'm trying to make something natural so listen sure the bombs will be from the U.S the bonds will be from Russia the bonds will be from China this will be from that this will be from that right all right we're still in the in the word and going down the line but what about all of us being religious Christian nations fighting against each other for what what is actually going to be what is your thoughts of Armageddon well one of these days the world is going to get mad somebody's going to push a button and they're just going to start doing that's always good but what's leading up to that how how do I get there other than just some drunk push a button you know I mean it's politude do you know that the president of the United States right now it keeps those ways before they consider a nuclear bomb anywhere they've got to have certain people get together and this has got a suitcase and that has got one and and all these things has got to be together to where they can get it to where they can push off one button because we know they know some drunk or get hold of the button they're doing everything to keep them from where they can set it off well you know naturally every country is going to be that way because they don't want their bonds or their own to go off so who is the battle of Armageddon fought against Earl going to be brought to a basis that we're actually going to be part of it I thought we believed that there would be a tribulation period and in that tribulation period everybody would have a mark of the Beast looking by ourselves without his Mark in their hand or their forehead and I thought we believe that Mark in the forehead was a Doctrine and the fact of the hand was the ability to work we can't work without it then who we fighting against now we're going to all be in one Covenant the Antichrist is going to have everybody in that one Covenant no matter what nation they're in they're going to be under it except for Israel right and the natural nation of Israel will also be in that Covenant I use the words the way I wanted it the natural nation of Israel amen it's only a hundred and forty four thousand and two witnesses that's right and they will be killed for their belief looks like the battle of Armageddon is defeated it looks like it's you see Israel one day will really realize what has went on when that Antichrist steps into that Temple and declares himself to be God then natural Israel will Rebel right nope that's when the bomb starts falling because it doesn't sitting all the way around her it won't be no wonderful little old USA that's fighting for Israel no that's right we will be we will be the destruction of Israel as well as the Arabs are today oh no no no you'll never never get us to do that mm-hmm well go ahead and believe what you won't do but try to have a little common sense sometimes right just plain Common Sense amen to think things over right if the whole world is going to be in an antichrist Covenant and there will be America and all then who's going to be fighting what during the tribulation those hundred forty four thousand and two innings will be able to call down plagues and all kinds of things right and even natural Israel will turn against her yep a new wife when they kill them but what do you think happens to Natural Israel about the time they begin to wake up because you know them two witnesses that 144 000 is going to be describing to Israel as a natural world on the internets and everything in the world they're going to be talking about just what I'm talking about tonight they're going to be talking and trying to tell Israel how they're in oh head over heels with an antichrist Covenant they don't blame them that's right no he's a wonderful guy oh look what he's done he's played all of our national debts yeah if I pay your debt brother Cauley oh you belong to me right yeah no we're in Freedom we'll tell the slaves that back in under a couple hundred years ago thank you but listen folks just trying to get a point across amen the point is the whole world is going to be in an antichrist Covenant for seven years he's going to make it that's right that's according to Book of Daniel all right amen he's going to make that Covenant just after us leaving here right and we just read a few quotes back there we're running around seeing Armageddon would be at the end of the tribulation but three and a half years through Israel all right right amen how do we leave it out of here there's three and a half years tribulation that's what your Prophet said but Satan makes his Covenant for one week why because he knows exactly what Jesus done he preached for one week three and a half years back there to declare himself to be God he preached three and a half years over here to declare himself to be God an will make his Covenant and see hey he done it in seven years and I'll do it in seven I'll make my Covenant card is odd isn't it that they make the Covenant for seven years right now but in the middle of that Israel will eventually win the 144 000 are killed and they realize when that man walks in there and says he's God now now he's saying he's in God's stead all right right they're electing now a man to will declare that he is in God's stead all right all right but then when one day he comes up and steps up there and says I'm God yep yeah they're going to realize man ain't talking about instead of gonna guard somewhere else right they're going to realize he's leaving himself to be that and Israel is going to Rebel yeah and they got the Simpson effect that's what they say you know what Samson done he brought the temple down on himself Israel's always said they're not afraid of their enemies God they got their Sampson effect they can call down the bombs right on their own self and blow it to Smithereens you say they won't do it I'll remind you with about 900 of them went up on the Masada is that right we've got four up there and they refused to be captives anymore and they killed himself which was contrary to their own laws they said how about even I've just got through reading a book that sister truly let me read and he was bringing it all the way down through you remember he used to be what the prime minister of Israel or something he was some kind of a big official back there and he was one of them that was there when they signed the uh the fact of the Israel being coming to Nation you know in a different thing smoke was written in 56 I think but he tells us thousands of thousands of people that would kill themselves to keep from becoming captive to their enemy so Israel is not going to be worried about what's going to happen yeah we will all be sitting there because of the Covenant the bombs won't be falling it's just it just 144 000 in the tribulation calling down the things the two witnesses calling down the things but we need to realize something went wrong she's going to start throwing some bombs and when she does everybody else is going to start doing mom and I read to you the prophet said it'd be the atomic destruction that will cleanse the Earth Yep amen one place he says one time I didn't bring this one but he said everything just killed before the millennium seek Armageddon though will take place until we get out of here and it'll be three and a half years after we get out of here be right at the end of the tribulation all right with three and a half years it is what I keep saying that because some people connect us together and think we believe in seven years tribulation ain't never taught nothing like that never will go today in the Bible amen there's only three and a half years of tribulation but you see a cleanser of the Earth has to take place and that's the injection that'll bring Armageddon into being remember what I bring a while ago verse 12. tells you if you freak these drives up right verse 17 till 17 18 19 says there'll be an earthquake it'll happen it'll be greater than any earthquake has ever been Armageddon is bridged in between to show us what's going to take place right there now we're going to read in a minute what really takes place at Armageddon God is going to come down now remember he's not coming down to fight for the 144 000 right he will be doing that while they're here Oh They'll be calling down plagues of all forms but remember Armageddon they're already gone Armageddon the two witnesses had already gone the Armageddon will come to be a total termination and God will come down and I'm going to say it this way the majority of the Ministers of this message believe that we're going to ride back and battle in the battle of Armageddon I guess you're still so uh hide up in the world and the thoughts of life that they just want us to get some kind of a sword and they want us to ride back on that white horse and just killing everybody you know just well we're going to be over one of us going to be a kung fu where everyone's going to be better than all of these you know because that's what's called but folks I let's think we're gonna ride back with him and fight about him now if you believe it that's your business know but I just don't believe that no amen what me would be what kind of a battle would we fight we're Eternal they're moral all we have to say right come on man Joe they're gone we'll be eternal sure we ride back with him into the millennial reign on my horses amen but Brett Brown says God comes on the scene defy himself in the battle of Armageddon because he's normal don't have to worry about nothing but he's going to let them now listen to what I'm talking about see there's where the problem we don't think right you know that God didn't destroy the world with water so that's right everybody with me amen you know he didn't you know who destroyed the world of water people that's right right people rocked it out of orbit my Nuclear stuff and atomics and things brother Brown and said God don't destroy man man destroys himself that's right man all right are we are we right through the battle of Armageddon is not going to be God is doing it so much he's just going to let them kill each other they're going to cause it because see everybody about the times I said that old Pope walks in there and he says I want you to know it don't matter where you're Muslim hoodoos or whatever what kind of what you are You Belong To Me I'm in charge when he does Israel is going to see their mistake somebody is going to mash the button and when they match the button everybody's gonna match the buttons when they wipe the world end up delivering just almost totally annihilated almost just burn it over we'll put it that way but it won't annihilate because we know better than that but it'll burn off all the sin and the chaos of man but see God just let them do it yourself he didn't destroy the world with water we said well I got a call from right around him hey man Brayden do you find the others her brother Ryan says man destroyed himself that's right he brought on this thing and keep us out of water you realize when that and what is that big old word around that great big earthquake in the water struck over Earth Tsunami Tsunami hey I'll get it one of these days you know that they claimed the world at that time I read that during that time I hadn't heard it anymore they said it knocked the Earth about two degrees back up that one was a big one yeah but this old boy that comes over here after the end of all of it that God does bring right that we just read in verse 17 or 18 and greater than ever been God's going to come down all right now if you believe it then listen um how far did we get did we reach well now we read 12 13. okay let's go to Forte we read Doyle did it and we've got about 12 14 minutes when I get through what it's called come what is it from right now then we read that one yeah first thing in heaven was a battle and all coming out we read that okay jump over it we're on 14. we'll get there anyway so listen listen this will be from paragraph 306 to paragraph 340 I thank you no three uh 25. all right this is the fourth seal so just listen to your profit read what he's just saying about this battle of Armageddon 1963 321 4C of paragraph starting three oh six and I said it'll go three two three five together they want to mix colored horse see he's given the this thing together mixed with Creed's denominations man-made doctrines is that right such a mixed colored now he's talking about riding the arm again and he ain't

read that in verse 15 of the 16th chapter through the day of the Lord all right so he's gathered them together and on this next colored worldly pale sick horse see we're only looking at it and so we only look at it like just some kind of a Catholicism up here Methodist Baptist he's tying it to the whole world right now you argue with him you know you read and see what he's saying this is not just a war of Baptist and methodists and Presbyterians against Israel it's the whole world the whole world right he said like my country wouldn't join up your country's already done the U.N was the start whether you want to believe it or not everybody wants to be in the U.N wouldn't that the choice of Israel or Sam she became in the U.N herself she was there about the time or right before really statehood was developed she was already in the U.N every country in the world is going to be in the U.N ET she wouldn't do me something and one day find out that was Satan's whole plan down through there anyway right come on let me get in a hurry they're Gathering now for The Showdown The Showdown will be an Armageddon according to the word seeing on to play A Horse no not on not the word on the Bell horse that's where people read according to the word see on the Pale Horse now the word ain't on The Pale Horse come on he's talking right riding on it with death pack with a name tapped on him

unity you hear the bad news speaking you know we won't do that we'll just kind of get along with them the old harlot in the first place he said right now here they are joining themselves together coming to that Showdown to Armageddon and riding on the mixed colored horse with one horse of white and one horse with red one horse with black and three different political now he's bringing that to the Natural side not the four combat beasts horses white no he's bringing it to work you know that there are on each sealed wild horse riders a real horse riders a black horse right come on and the political power spiritual power controlled by the demon power which is the Antichrist mixing that all together you got a pale secret looking thing he's riding on that's right now notice look what he's riding on this pale looking Grizzly colored horse mixed with black and red and white coming into the battle Gathering his subjects from every nation under heaven did not Daniel interpret the dream and seen that streak of iron running to Every Nation you remember the other week about that all right here they come get her now this now sit still right it closed just a minute and listen they're getting together and gathering in now to do it bringing his subjects from the four corners of the earth riding a pale sickly three-coated mix colored horse same man Revelations 19 Christ is getting ready now Christ is getting ready in Revelation 19 the battle is going to be hot and heavy Christ in Revelations 19. get Christ together and he is from the four corners of the Earth now watch that next few words that's the key to understanding a lot of times Christ together he is not from the four corners of the Earth because there's going to be a little bitty red right that's all that's going to be on earth that little Remnant is you and I that's keeping them to come in from Battle right now but that little Remnant is is real 144 000 the two witnesses there's a little Remnant left on Earth go to Revelations 19 coming down we're coming down with him yeah but not to fight a battle but what are we going to do okay he's getting in from the four corners of Heaven we'll get them sold under the altar tomorrow night and you'll see whether it's right or not so these this group that he's got is gathered in heaven the others are getting on Earth four corners of Heaven on Snow White Horse these also have the name not death but the word of God lie that it wrote right on his thigh hear the word of God that's the only life because God is the only source of eternal life there he is Zoe that's right you've got life riding on a white horse and here's a man with three different powers mixed up Called Death given his Earthbound delegates and Christ is gathered and he is heaven-born subjects Saints all right we're going to ride back into the millennium but are we going to be fighting a battle that's the point I'm asking you I'm a kind of a battle would we find if we were already Eternal Immortal human beings right what would we find remember the part of the little Remnant yeah because that's where Armageddon takes place let that little Remnant just disappear in your Kong arm again and then we go riding into the Millennium not have to fight I've always said that to people I said oh my God what's your thought what what do you mean brother sit right over here one day one of the ministers means you remember he said well I always I've always been called that we fight that battle I said well when yeah right I mean they got Bazookas they got you know flamethrowers they got atomic bombs and we got the word to go to them and all that's gone what kind of a battle but she's having a Time 19 into a joke cause we go over into the millennium still wiping this thing out across got life right on him you're a white horse and often they're called the children because see those with him are owned by horses also they are to call the children before the foundation world this is when we get on over we'll read it in the 19th Chapter where the name is written on the side and the different children from the foundation World faithful to the word of God word of their choosing and all stimulated with new wine and oil just riding Right Along coming down to meet him they know the Thunders will issue the thing the thing course pretty soon what how does he do it so if he is the word and his name is the word and the word is where is life the Antichrist anything against it so Antichrist against the Christ the word so it's got to be a creep denomination which is against the word coming right back over to where we are they ain't going down what they say and don't miss it don't get the wrong thing come to the church ages I'm just trying to save time here we see life and death coming to the final struggle well just like some kind of battle we're going to make all right sounds just like we're going to come back in a battle thank you but let me just end that one time I tried to explain it Sunday there's quotes on down below where you gathers your subject and I'll try to explain it Sunday afternoon we're right now in a spiritual battle alarm again right right no doubt and for us to be able to be able to ride on that one of my horses to come back into the millennium this battle is going to have to be solved here now that's right amen for Rapture to take place for the bride this battle of Armageddon is going to have to be settled down that's right spiritual battle because we're not going to have a physical battle we're not going over the earth I don't even believe when we come riding back we're going to ride right in in the very presence of us and him coming in or just annihilate anything anyway it won't be a battle I've always been against that point of even thinking about a physical combat when their Mortals and we're Immortals right not these Immortals of these uh what is it the kind of a nine degree black belts don't even fight no more because there's so much Superior so much you know beyond and all like that well then they ain't even in the race whether it's that somebody's standing there it's Eternal right right because they still ain't eternal you remember that one he was about a six seven eight or somewhere in there and he decided he's gonna go sit down in that line dinner that Tiger's Den well they found a couple of pieces of his body and some of the skull because he thought he could go in there and whoop it oh boy just remember as long as we're in this world I don't care how fast you are how good you are with your feet in your hands you cannot run a bullet right right and that ain't even nothing the current prior to what we're talking about this gets a natural but listen Church if you and I can't win this battle over the Antichrist Doctrine and that's what we're battling amen whether you believe it or not you're battling doctrines hey man all right I'm not bad in the doctor I'm just having battling flesh well anyway you've got more to the battle to get on one of these days than you need to get on with it that's why a lot of people are never listen enough to know I've had people to look me every bit in the face of me telling them showing so so and so and they said he never said that here's the tape you want to listen to it you just make him say something if you want to say it he said Jesus went and gone to the River Jordan here it is read it you don't listen to it and she said right there and listen to weeks and hours and months of sermons of people and never catch thereof what's wrong maybe something wrong somewhere right especially here in what we've been trained right amen right train me to the point of to listen to every word you say it and the way out whatever words you say it and to see what you were talking about more than seeing what your mouth was literally letting out amen that's right and you know that there's a lot of these doctrines among the brethren that you can't find out from them what you want you got to go to somebody else you go to some of their assistances or some Churches following them and you'll get the truth about it I can go into a lot of doctrines and bring out a lot of natural things and I know of being hateful in there that's all about it but I've tried my best to help you if anybody else out there is listening that's up to you to what you listen to I'm not your pastor I'm not pastored internet I'm Pastor in Lula Georgia and then all but listen if we don't win this battle and they and if it don't come to a change of the body the Antichrist has whipped us whether you want to believe it or not right he's defeated us but it will stand up against it and say you're not saying what the prophet said right amen you know what they'll eventually won't come around because that's why they don't come here all right and one brother said he said I'll go anywhere in the messaging challenge the people to come and show me we're wrong but he said I don't do it Lula Georgia I know what I mean you think that felt that you think that made it big no it made him about as little as crawling under the floor because if he's afraid to do it here he ought to be afraid to do it anywhere in the world against the Bride of Jesus Christ right what I say I say here what I've always said I said home when I do I stand by what I say that's right because see this thing's got to be if we don't win this battle of Armageddon spiritually they're not going to be a physical battle over there amen but I'm trying my best to get you to see the night the battle of Armageddon is not Russia and China in the base of yes that's them coming down but he'd be Protestants and Catholics for the world and converts everything to their Doctrine that's right oh the Buddhist won't take down the temples of Buddha no the muscles will take down the temperature the bad this won't change the name the master this won't change come on he's going to destroy like that it's just when everybody's got the same Doctrine right one of them brother now wrote it down Muhammad didn't believe that that Mary was the mother of God I promise they probably didn't I don't know maybe he did but I'm trying to say he probably didn't but he was a heathen right right he wasn't a Christian I hear this Catholicism I've got it down in here look right around and said Nazism fascism communism winds up in Catholicism now Nazi ism communism fascism pretty well ruled shows you the world right you just come into mohammadisms and yeah yeah one of the isms and you know you go over to India right now that brother precaution says they have over what three million gods and goddesses and you go over actually I want to tell you about it you God will they okay Savannah we'll listen to you wasn't that what they were doing on Mars Hill they had an inscription for how many gods but just in case they left one out they made a little opening and set it down you know probably didn't put nothing in it just had a little block and it said under the bottom to the unknown God just in case they missed one of them you got the god of the toes you got the god of the heels you got the god of the feet you got out of the mouth you've got the god of the rain got the god of the sun you got all these villains and goddesses just in case you had one of them out so what did Paul say that's the card I want to talk to you about the unknown God see Church the unknown God is the only God there is there's not no catholicisms in the romanisms in this kind of ism and fascism and communism it's all that's what I'm trying to get you to see read the four seal it all comes down into one thing it'll all get tied up in Catholicism who's got to go to the world now come on I don't give a hoot I don't mean anything but can I I'm trying to make a point doesn't matter to me if it's China India Russia Africa what's the difference one more heaters the problem is going to be when the big guy stepped up and says I own you said we're not gonna say Okay pay you debt was that not what happened to Communism who do you think the world Banks and all the people are you know that I read shortly after communism went down that day was at that time after then but there were more billionaires in Russia than there was in the United States where do you think their money was at Swiss bank account right come on properties brought it up now they own everything and what am I trying to get you to see those three unclean spirits like frogs just went to the profit said to every corner of the world and gonna bring them from every place in the world to bring them down to their to where he can declare himself to be God and those that rebel against him he'll destroy them why because he owns the wealth of the world the Bible says in him we'll get on over and read a few more where it says the merchants that used to trade with him listen it says they back off from him it's just showing the natural since they back off from what from Rome the merchants of the world back off because when they see battling go down no come on you understand one more time don't matter what country in the world it is it's all hedonism Israel is the only nation when it comes to the tribulation that even is trying to believe that a one true and living God form right you're right the United States we're already trinitarian to the course of what's the matter amen rides are supposed to be gone so it ain't nothing like that Israel will be left and when he walks in there and says I'm glad to look at him and say you're not him but that's not the 144 000 that's not to well that's just natural Israel when they wind up and see what's wrong and then they push the buttons the things start blowing the then God or step on with a great earthquake and just wipe everything you see what I'm talking about amen you see what I've been trying to get across to you for 40 years read the seal book I remember I was looking down through the chart list you know all the books the index thing I'm looking at the index one day and I saw a tape there and it said invasion of the U.S man I run up here and I look through our tapes and I found that I thought I'm gonna find out how this United States gets War this Beat to Death or so what country is going to do it Russia's coming in when I heard brother Ryan say one of these days you'll wake up and there'll be a Russian standing with a gun pointed in your face that's what he said all right he starts talking about what I'm talking about he starts talking about not a nations of the world but how that Catholicism through Methodist and Baptists and Presbyterian the Pentecostal and brown of my she didn't use that word there I put it in we showed how that they are conquered by the Catholicism the pope don't want the the other countries to come down and bow down to him and call him God in the bases of of they've got their own they keep their own religious beliefs but they belong to me and he says if you don't Bow Down yep I'll declare your debt invite it and take over the whole country you say you can't do that we're the image to the Beast we're the people that sets up all of those things until it comes our Doomsday I hope you understand what I'm talking about if you and I can't win this spiritual battle and go out of here in a Rapture though don't be concerned about all of that as well there's nothing to do with us it'll be an end of all time you and I have got to become one with the word gotta Unite with the word we're reading become one with that word that's right and to do that it might cost us a lot of friendships you know it's cost me a lot of them for me just standing here and saying this is the way I see it if you don't believe it come and show me something different that's made me everything in the world the coach there is a bride there is a God there is a word that's right and that word is what's going to conquer that word to those two prophets is going to bring down plagues right yeah right you know that God don't have to be here to end it up an Armageddon those two witnesses can stand there just before their translation and they can say Let It Be yep that 144 000 if they live any longer don't go up in there with it they can stand right there and say Let It Be that's right and it will be amen and God don't have to come down and battle and I hope that's one thing that sunk in tonight what kind of a battle would it be between Mortals and an eternal Immortal bride the battle is going on now amen that's right that's right if you and I can't take the word and stand here now and say this is what the prophet said forget it and we're going to be in the world Council of churches because we're already got the trinitarian ID on their mind oh but brother Dale we should be friendly with everybody I try to don't you yeah show me somebody that I haven't tried to be friends with when I befriended people that I didn't even agree with I let people come preaching this church that I knew they was wrong proud to be friends with them I tried to be a brother in the Lord the man jumped like everything and said an antichrist wrote to his church I called him and said you're wrong but you're preaching Wednesday night right here in my church to prove it I don't have anything against you now how many preachers would do that when you call them on Southern Antichrist how many preachers out there of you on the internet how many of you would do it I've tried to be friends with everybody to love everybody but I'm trying my best to stay with this word amen right I want to know what that Prophet had to say that's right your opinion in my opinion ain't worth fooling with no that's right see it's going to be a word born bride that'll take a change not a bunch of babies sniffling running around can't never be satisfied can't never be settled right there's no stand on the word and say the word says it and I believe it what do you think about it they're going to be a spiritual battle in you and I if that's not one there won't be a physical battle they need to no need to have it but let me tell you the story before we handle they will be your bride they will take God's word and they will be a spiritual arm again and bombarding us like now to death about it doctrines and ideas flying on every hand was wrong didn't even now saying Jesus was wrong and yet I'm wrong to say something I stood right here in 1974 and proved that we could pass the year 2026. and not break a word on it and prove it by Brother round but I've never been popular and nobody's ever asked me to come to their church and preach it come on you simple brother Dale you're just I know it I'm just human I'm just me but you know these brothers can go out and prophesy and predict and do everything in the world and condemn you and scream and holler at you you've got to believe what I'm saying oh that's bruh he's a good brother you see I fight this out at home in my own self I'm not trying to be hateful to nobody I've never tried to be I try to love everybody and try to help everybody I'd fly anywhere in the world today to try to help somebody if it was really appointed woman and you start thinking of Apple all right do anything I could to help somebody I'm not going to get out of here I'm like brother my brother said you know he said he was 80 years old and he said I'm going to get out of here one way or the other pretty quick and I agree with you he's gonna die or he's going to Rapture or something that's 80 years old well there's a lot of us getting on up there and got some gears on us you know and uh let me think about it let's stay back on these things Armageddon if the forces can't be terminated and you and I they can't be terminated in the world it can't be done all right I hope you'll just take what I said and lay it down and then come and show me if I'm wrong or Israel is at and how Israel is in the Covenant with the Antichrist the whole world is in the Covenant with the Antichrist that's what your Bible says and Merchants of the World when they see her fall and get on over another chapter and says they back away from her so the whole world must be in an antichrist Covenant and don't you think well we we we're not in the Covenant brother we're not these things don't get made overnight covenants between nations are sometimes many years in the making before they're consummated as a covenant the Pope step down somebody else's gonna take over the two main Front Runners as of yesterday's paper I'd cheer some people up out there on the internet yesterday's papers said the Two Front Runners that were answering all the questions related to this situation we're from the U.S that was in yesterday's paper let's not be the guy that comes to the U.S but what if it ain't what are we gonna do but what if it is what are we gonna do go ahead number 15 when the redeemed again amen I am thank you now she wants to believe that and stand on it imagine for them to do our Lord me remember that is foreign foreign okay we're doing work matter of you can't win the battle of the mind there's nothing to work for you but you know Creighton's inroad s but you know why why can't we believe it this way brother Brown and said if you get a prayer cloth now if I miss the number wise forget that well you said something like you're 50 healed if you've got a prayer cloth I've listened to that the other day you have a percentage you know if you get the prayer cloth you're you're that much healed he said when you left that seat sister and started walking this way he said that's where it was settle that right back if I was the biggest hypocrite in the world you know the biggest that could ever be thought of if your faith is in just walking down here and saying brother Dale pray for me then how can you fail to get what you're asking product that's right but I don't believe I'm the biggest hypocrite I may be one but I so then I want to join with you right but I'm gonna do it this way you go back to your seat because Irish where it was settle down that's when you said I'm going up there to ask about this I'm going up there to to seek God about this I need healing I need this I need that yes it will settle down that's where he's talking to him you're talking to me now sometimes believe it anybody else think about it what do you believe about it why can't we just believe in simple truth to you I might not be even us it's a revelation now oh my God the other songs foreign Lord just reminded me when I got back here weeks ago I couldn't know your office I told you I had the corner rotator cuff from two torn tendons in my right shoulder hey man look at his arms I should let's just believe me thank you I'm sorry I'm not like that buddy I'm sorry that when people come and ask me to pray and I don't scream and holler it just challenge the devil and meet people over there I'm sorry just it's not me

most wonderful perfume that could ever be thought of to be able to see you but yet I'm sorry that I'm not like everybody else that has you know just me just okay I'd just like to say it's wonderful to see somebody though abandon their self they're everything before the Lord amen most people would not get down on their knees in front of the altar because they had too much pride it wouldn't look right if they might make an idiot out of themselves but when you can just totally let yourself go like listen up and just no wonder she has answers to prayer right you know I wish that I could abandon myself that's what I was saying to these sisters up there just abandon yourself before God and lay it all out there I appreciate Lisa amen me yeah I called you but I just wanted to tell everybody else that you know I was streaming Sunday morning I saw Barbara go up for prayer for me and I heard what you said and um that before she got there to give me the prints off May everything be okay I was just sitting there about 30 minutes later and I realized Saturday night May back up Saturday night I was hurting so bad I would just cry when I swallowed and with the strep throat and all and it was I was miserable and so then Sunday when I saw y'all pray and then I wouldn't even really thinking about it about 30 minutes later all those I was not hurting at all just believe anybody else remember these that are sick and things come back Satan will do everything he can he did deny to come and attacked Abby here at the church she was playing running doing like everything especially the makeup

the dog but I can for kids let's just believe everything will be all right Lord Jesus we thank you for touching little Abby for a little like baby egg ceremony please Satan would do everything he could tonight to him but yet he can't stop you nowhere you are a God and you change mine that's right we just must believe your word forgive me Lord about human ways and Endeavors of trying to explain your word to try to get people to see you and just believe you I can't do anything that helps in the morning I just ask you to help us and go with us on our way home take care of everybody give a safe
