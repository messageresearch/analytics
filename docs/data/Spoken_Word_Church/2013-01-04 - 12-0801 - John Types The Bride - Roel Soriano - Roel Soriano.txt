this time of year but i was shocked to find out that it's hotter here in in america now than in the philippines so but we bring you greetings from the from my church in taitai it's a town called taitai in the province of rizal just outside of metro manila we call our church the church of the overcomer i want to thank the lord for the privilege of being able to minister to the bride part of the part of the bride in in lulu georgia this evening amen i miss brother samuel dale but i know he's down in florida somewhere having a good time amen praise the lord before i let you be seated um we'll go to the scripture reading in revelations chapter four the fourth chapter of revelation i trust that tonight something can be said that will bless the heart of the people remember the last time i was here we we had a good time the presence of the lord came and we were all blessed i'm trusting that he will give us a repeat of that night tonight hallelujah i'm going to entitle this short message john types the bride revelation chapter 4 verse 1 the bible said after after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will surely the things which must be here after hereafter verse two and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne these are the words of the lord we'll pray heavenly father we ask that you bless the words that we have just read tonight anointed to our hearts lord jesus as we talk about the meaning of it tonight we bless us and reach down and father meet the need of each and every believer that has come here tonight for we want you to take all the glory and honor out of this service in jesus name amen may be seated in revelation chapter 10 verse 11 john was given the commission he said to me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings so i got this thought from what the prophet said about john being the type of the rapture church john being the type of the individual believer that has been caught up in the revelation of the word of god praise the lord in the feast of the trumpets um butter banham also said that um the seventh seal which is a very controversial virtual seal i don't know how it is here in in this country but in our country people are fighting over it you know uh some people believe that the seventh seal is open already some people believe that it's not open something yeah some people believe it's partially open well um i know what the prophet said about the seventh seal the seventh seal is said it's revelation 10. hallelujah the seventh seal is revelation 10 hallelujah and so uh if if we can only understand uh the contents of the tenth chapter of revelation as ministered to us by the prophet of malachi 4 then we can see our place because revelations 10 is the passing the passing of revelation right right from the mighty angel to the messenger of this day hallelujah to john who types the bride hallelujah so this is all happening in revelation 10 i want you to understand that we're now living in the opening of the seventh seal hallelujah this is the half hour silence uh the bible is talking about in revelation chapter eight verse one when the seventh seal was opened there was uh uh uh there was silence for about half an hour in heaven amen hallelujah i want you to understand that we're right here right we're living it revelation 10 hallelujah this is the seventh seal thank you lord when um preached the church ages in 1960 revelation chapter 4 he said this and notice john being taking up being being taken up immediately excuse me after the church age what's the type of the raptured church immediately after the church age is over this lay of the sea and church aids then comes then comes the rapture the church goes up like john did into the presence of god hallelujah that's the reason we read in revelations chapter 4 verse 1 our scripture reading hallelujah what says after this i look after the church ages then john is caught up into the presence of god hallelujah do you see the type john was caught up in the spirit he saw a door open in heaven and was caught up into this door in heaven and he plainly saw the godhead and god showed him the things that are going to happen in the future john saw the seals unfold john heard the seven thunders he actually he actually heard what they were hallelujah because he was about to write the bible said i was about to write when i heard the seven thunders but then uh the angel forbid him to write to write this but he heard it and then he took he took the book from from the hand of the mighty angel and ate the open book hallelujah and he then is commissioned to prophesy again unto many towns and nations and then john lived to see the coming of the lord john lived to see the coming of the lord you might ask when well in matthew 17 the lord was transfigured before him and he actually saw it in matthew 16 the lord said there be some of you that are standing here that will not even taste that until they see the son of man coming in his glory therefore john saw but the ground who called it the preview of the coming of the lord amen hallelujah because moses was there elijah appeared with the lord jesus moses representing the dead in christ and elijah representing those that are alive and remain this was the sin of the coming of the lord hallelujah and he saw it he was privileged to saw it to see thank you lord and brother branham said in this in question and answers 1961 he said this about us but this message that i'm preaching is the true message of this day you agree this is the true message of this day and it's it is the last message amen hallelujah you see what i'm doing brethren he said i'm putting you all in the same place i am because you are just much as much into it as i am and then he said you are messengers of this same message i believe he's addressing the church hallelujah and he's telling us we are messengers of the same message the scene of revelations chapter 10 unfolding the mighty angel coming down with an open book in his hand hallelujah and then in revelations 10 7 is is brother branham's ministry he was the one that preached the opening of the seals and then um john was was commanded to take the book and eat it hallelujah and then prophesy again john types the bride of jesus christ john types the rapture bride hallelujah and so we are here to eat the book meaning digest the message meaning leave the message make it a part of our life hallelujah we can demonstrate this the very same life of the son of man the very life of jesus the very life of god hallelujah manifested again in the last days hallelujah how can you manifest it if you don't eat it first you must take the open book first it must be open you see and not just six seals are open but seven sails are open hallelujah because if one seal is left unopened or unbroken hallelujah the book can never come open amen hallelujah so we're living in an open book in this age tonight i believe we are living in in an age where the bible becomes a new book to us hallelujah there's no more mystery about it still mysterious to the to the denominational world out there but to the bride of jesus christ there's no more mystery amen hallelujah because in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound then the mystery of god should be finished it shall be finished to the bride of christ hallelujah you see but we should not be content i believe we're just discussing the message talking about the message hallelujah we need to take the book and eat it hallelujah we need to live this message hallelujah this precious message that the lord gave us the privilege to hear in this last day hallelujah because you become the messengers of this same message hallelujah hallelujah but yet we have something to do right hallelujah we are left with the open book we are left with elijah's robe hallelujah and a double portion of the spirit this message is not just for ministers to argue about in ministers meaning hallelujah this message is the power of god amen hallelujah this message is not a set of doctrines that we discovered this message is the very life of god hallelujah and you are messengers of this same message amen in end-time evangelism said this god is looking for character not membership character eliezer when he went to get the bride of christ or the bride of isa he sweated it out until he found character right hallelujah he did not just uh go and try to find some uh women out there on the street he made sure he found character right here remember abraham put him responsible as god puts us responsible i hope you you catch this brothers and sisters this is a big responsibility amen abraham put eliezer responsible as god puts us responsible but mindset and then he said heart my bride hallelujah that's our commission in this half hour silence right of the seventh seal is to hunt my bride hallelujah you know you don't hunt as some domesticated chicken no you hunt the rare specie you hung eagles you have to go to the highways and the byways to find the predestinated seed to find character hallelujah we're not trying to find church members here hallelujah right we're finding the last scene the last of the seed of abraham hallelujah and it's a big responsibility hallelujah i don't see how message believers can be complacent and be contented with just sitting in a pew and having some fellowship chips picnic yeah well there's a lot to be done hallelujah we are responsible god is holding us responsible as abraham help eliezer responsible amen i hope that saves hallelujah because that's what we are here for right that is our commission that's the ministry the ministry and the commission of the bride of christ is to heart god's seed hallelujah in the book of john chapter 19 verse 26 and 27 this was when jesus was crucified at the foot of the cross as he was hanging on the cross he saw mary there verse 26 says when jesus therefore saw his mother and he and the disciples standing by whom he loved so he saw two persons marrying his mother and the disciple the disciple whom he loved of course we understand that this disciple whom especially love there's nothing is this uh none other than john the divine hallelujah the disciple whom jesus loved he said unto his mother woman behold thy son and in verse 27 then said he to the disciple behold thy mother it was like jesus was now relinquishing his human responsibility of taking care of his mother he's not dying on the cross his earthly ministry was finished hallelujah but somebody has to take care of his mother in the flesh so he commissioned john hallelujah amen of all the disciples it was john the jesus commission to take care of his mother hallelujah i hope you can see yourself here the jesus commissioned he relinquished his earthly responsibility to john the disciple the bible said whom jesus loved amen hallelujah and then and then the bible said and from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home right he assumed now the role of being the son of mary he took her home with him and from that time on hallelujah the responsibility of jesus fell upon john hallelujah i hope you're seeing yourself now amen hallelujah in john right john is quite an interesting person right he's quite a character he's known in the bible as the sons of thunder him and his brother james right of course you know the reason why they're called sons of thunder because he's so aggressive and he's so bold in wanting to promote the lord hallelujah and promote the gospel we read in luke chapter 9 verse 53-55 where it says and they did not receive him the lord jesus the samaritan people they did not receive him because his ways his face was as though he would he would go to jerusalem and when his disciples james and john saw this the bible said they said lord wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them even as goliaths dead it's interesting that that they made mention of the prophet elias or elijah hallelujah because like the prophet elijah they are now getting a complex come on because because they did not receive him hallelujah and they were very zealous in telling other people about christ in promoting his ministry telling about them about the gospel that he carries and when they did not the people did not believe him now they want the lord to rain fire and brimstone upon the people and kill them all hallelujah do you remember elijah had the same complex in first kings chapter 19 he tells of the story where after shaming the 800 or so prophets of baal hallelujah in a showdown on mount carmel all right verbatim speaks of this anointing leaving elijah and now we see him um he always sings just the negatives he was telling god i'm i'm very zealous for you my lord oh god but then your people they have uh disobeyed your commandments they have torn down the altars and slayed your prophets with the sword now only i am left and thereafter my life you see he was having a complex hallelujah because the people would not receive his hallelujah if you're not careful things we will develop the same complex for the love of this message the seal that we have in trying to communicate to others and people just keep on turning us down and turning us down and rejecting the message rejecting the grace of god upon their lives hallelujah if we're not careful we'll develop a complex and we'll be like john because john pipes the bride amen will will we'll take on this self-righteous spirit and we will begin judging others just because they wouldn't believe the first time we tell them hallelujah brothers and sisters let's be careful right the lord told obey a parable in in the bible in one of the gospels he told he told of the parable of the two sons which the father asked to work in his vineyard the older one said after he asked him to work in his vineyard the older one said yes i would go and work work for you today but the older one did not go he just said yes and then the younger one said no at first right and then he changed his mind and he went to work in his father's virginia the question is which one of these two son did the will of the father the one that said no at first hallelujah you see people can say no at first this message hallelujah right like paul first persecuted the first christian and said no to the gospel but then god turned him around and he saw the light he received the revelation hallelujah of the gospel thank you jesus so i'm encouraging your saints right amen hallelujah not to give up not to be discouraged hallelujah just because three people said no hallelujah that's the way you have to stop right amen you have to press on hallelujah because you have a great responsibility before you god is holding you responsible as abraham is holding hell eliezer responsible to heart god's bride amen hallelujah that's why in the philippines you have never stopped hallelujah we still do the message presentation seminars hallelujah how can we stop doing something that is born so much true and has led hundreds maybe thousands of believers denominational christians into the light of the message of the hour right amen hallelujah just this month i was in the city of kalaukani conducting a seminar amongst ministers and workers of four trinitarian uh churches pentecostals through italian churches in kaluakan city and my they just love what they heard amen hallelujah and and now we're getting ready for a bigger bigger seminar maybe when we go back hallelujah they're organizing a seminar where about 100 ministers will be in participation because they want to hear more they want to share what they heard the first time hallelujah about the message uh that god has uh given us in these last days to get the bride ready for the rapture hallelujah so i can think of hundreds of denominational groups that have forsaken their organization to embrace the truth of the message of the app hallelujah well somebody tried to do it in in in ohio because it was it's it has been very successful in our country they think maybe it's gonna work in ohio so they invited about 200 denominational ministers to come to a uh message presentation seminar and on the day of the seminar only two ministers showed up out of the two hundred only two showed up so they they went ahead and all right and and uh did the presentation anyway and video the presentation and they sent the 200 ministers that were invited copies of the expo seminar video uh expo seminar hallelujah so they wouldn't come to the seminar the brother said we take the seminar to them so i understand it's not working in america but it is still working in our country hallelujah god is still calling amen hallelujah not just ministers not just pastors because usefully when the pastor receives a revelation of the the message and he starts sharing it to his people and the whole congregation comes in amen right now we are working with at least 200 groups that have recently in the in the past four or five years coming to the message in the philippines so we're combating your prayers do you promise to pray for us because it's such a challenge to be facing all those learned men they've been in seminaries five five years in the theological colleges and earned their uh uh doctorate in theology and you have to face them and teach them about the word hallelujah you don't know what kinds of what kind of questions they'll be asking but by the grace of god hallelujah all questions this far has been answered amen hallelujah praise praise the lord because i believe we have the answer amen right man you believe the message you have the answer because the message is god's word for the day hallelujah and so jesus you turned and rebuked them and said you know not what manner of spirit you are off he rebuked john he said the son of man came to save lives not to destroy them amen hallelujah amen so john learned a lesson on grace hallelujah and we need to be careful because i find it a lot amongst message believers message churches it's easy it's easy to judge other people just because they said no the first time hallelujah but we need to be patient with people amen hallelujah because they're not coming because you know right we're good at sharing the message to them they're not coming because of our ability they're coming because of the grace of god right man and that's the way we all came by the grace of god amen hallelujah we don't all deserve to be in the bride we deserve to to go to hell is what we deserve that's right hallelujah amen but then god is has been so gracious to us right he showed us grace and showed us a revelation of the word right so you see the transformation of john now from having the self-righteous and condemnative spirit or attitude hallelujah he turned to be the apostle i call him the apostle of love hallelujah first john chapter four seven and eight here's what he has to say the one that wrote the book of revelation the one that has been entrusted with the deep things of god hallelujah he said in first gen 4 78 beloved let us love one another this is deep brothers and sisters hallelujah you think the open is deep you think uh the seven seals are deep this is deep amen hallelujah hallelujah for the love for love is of god and everyone that loves it is born of god right oh my god right that's why the bible calls him john the beloved hallelujah john the beloved he that love it is born of god and knoweth god he that love it not know it god know it not god for god is love how deeper can you get again hallelujah amen of all the four gospel writers john caught the revelation of agape right right because he writes in john 13 the words of the lord jesus he said a new commandment i give unto you that you love one another as i have loved you that ye also love one another by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you love for one another hallelujah thank you jesus he understood that agape is the greatest amen now there are by the three things love of hope big hope and charity and the greatest is love paul said even here you have all the revelation of the word and if you don't have love in you it means nothing amen amen hallelujah you are nothing john 15 12 and 13 this is my commandment jesus said that you love one another as i have loved you love one another as i have loved you hallelujah greater love than no no man than this then a man laid down his life for his friend what a love that's right hallelujah that somebody would die for me that's right amen for sinners such as i hallelujah so this is the original teaching amen is the teaching on agape right first john chapter 3 verse 11. says for this is the message that you've heard from the beginning so this is the original message my friends this is the message that you heard from the beginning that what that we should love one another amen not as kane who was that of the wicked one and slew his brother and that were for saluting him because his own words were evil and his brother's righteous at the end of the day the battle is going to be against between the love of god and the hatred of the devil amen hallelujah people were being so bound with the hatred of the devil as chaos hallelujah to kill his own brother all right but in the same token people will be so engulfed with the love of god that's right hallelujah to be able to love their enemies and verb said to love the unlovable amen right to be able to pray for those who despisefully use hallelujah and give the other chick hallelujah love the unlovable thank you jesus amen talk about the original teaching amen right this is it all right hallelujah it's actually the proof of individual spirit according to john first john chapter 3 verse 23 to 24 and this is his commandment that we should believe on the name of his son jesus christ and love one another listen to the disciple the apostle of love this is his commandment that we should believe in the name of his son jesus christ and love one another as he gave us commandments right and he that keepeth his commandments dwelled in him and he in him hereby we know that he abideth in us by the spirit which he has given us the holy spirit is truly dwelling in you you can't help but love your brother that's right hallelujah question is do you know god that's it that's the foundation that's the foundation of the church is the revelation of who jesus christ is upon this rock he said i will build my church and the gates of hell will never prevail against it amen first john 4 7 8 7 and 8 beloved let us love one another this is deep my brothers and sisters let us love one another for love is of god and everyone that love it is born of god and know it god he that love it no neither love it not know it not god for god is love and how many people say they know the message they know the doctrine of the godhead come on they know who jesus christ said right hallelujah and can't love their brothers just because they have a different way of seeing things hallelujah can't love your brother because he goes with some other camp that you don't fellowship with let me tell you one thing about him denominational system is a carnal system that separates brotherhood oh amen hallelujah and we think we've come out of the nominational system don't have enough love to forgive our brothers and sisters to try to get go along with them no matter the differences but being said because if you think of it no two person can agree a hundred percent in understanding the scriptures not in this flesh let's get real hallelujah if not two person can see eye to eye hundred percent on scriptures because we're still in this flesh hallelujah the remedy is love you have to have enough love in you to understand your brother amen you have to have enough love in you to give grace to those who need it and not to be asking the lord to send fire from heaven and consume the people that don't agree with us somebody said it's a sad thing that we all came out of the nomination but denomination has not come out of some people hallelujah because it's a carnal spirit that separates brotherhood hallelujah first gen 4 verse 11 and 12. i mean we've been reading from the epistles of saint john and this is all he has to say beloved if god so loved us we are also to love one another no man has seen god at any time if we love one another god dwelled in us and his love is perfected in us talk about perfection the bride is going to be perfect amen hallelujah you remember the statue of a perfect man brother even drew a diagram for us all these glitches hallelujah need to be in a believer hallelujah because if you think about it nobody's perfect not one of us the bible said all have come short of the glory of god hallelujah there's only one that's perfect and that's jesus christ hallelujah but praise the lord because jesus christ now dwells in a body of believers called the bride of christ amen hallelujah no man has seen god at any time but they belove one another god dwells in us oh my and his love is perfected in us right lord to god second john chapter 1 verse 5. if you love him you will obey his word and now john said listen to the doctrine of saint john this is very deep teaching now now i resist the lady talking about the elect lady of all the disciples john wrote to the elect lady lady he addresses his epistle to the elect lady and we know that's the bride not as though i wrote a new commandment in today but that's which we had from the beginning that we love one another john don't you have anything deeper to say right beloved if god so loved us we ought to also to love one another no man had seen god at any time if we love one another god dwelled in us and his love is perfected in us ii john 1 5 and now i beseech the lady not as though i wrote a new commandment unto thee but that which we had from the beginning that we love one another hallelujah and this is love let me walk after his commandments this is the commandment that as you have heard from the beginning you should walk in it walk in what walk in love hallelujah amen that's why he has this revelation in first john chapter 3 verse 16. you know john chapter 3 verse 16 speaks about the love of god for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life but john called a revelation of that scripture hallelujah he understood that that scripture has been fulfilled by the lord jesus christ it has himself been fulfilled but we have a scripture to fulfill and that is in first john chapter 3 verse 16 it's not hard to remember john 3 16 first john chapter 3 verse 16. you know what it says let me read it to you hereby perceive we the love of god because he laid down his life for us and we are to lay down our lives for the brethren amen oh my this is the love of god hallelujah not to say to your brother or your sister on sunday morning god bless you my brother god bless you my sister but to actually lay down your life for the sake of your brethren eternal life you want to know you have eternal life if you want to make sure you possess eternal life is said right you will expand your life benefiting others eternal life is living for others amen that's right so hallelujah was told to come up here i'm reading better venom revelation chapter 4 he said after this i looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show the things which must be hereafter but said john was caught up in the vision caught up into glory we find them that john was a type of every true believer at first he said john is a type of the rapture church now he says john is a type of every true believer hallelujah amen that will be summoned by christ on high is that right he said someone come up either come up higher see he was in the candlesticks speaking from them to his church then the church ages ceased and he left the earth and moved up into the heavens and cold is redeemed up with him oh isn't that beautiful it just makes my head jump hallelujah amen he called john into the heavens and because john types the bride hallelujah he's calling the bride now into the heavens and said heaven is consists heaven consists of the word amen hallelujah so the bride of christ must be summoned to come up higher hallelujah our bodies may be here in in lula georgia but something in us has already been caught up in heavenly places we are already sitting in heavenly heavenly places in christ oh it just makes my heart jump hallelujah i can see why we can all get excited hallelujah because we are a people that have been called to come up like here we have a summons from from the heavenly throne come up either thank you jesus revelation chapter 4 he said not immediately after he showed the end of the age of his work here he went on up into heaven and said i'll show you what's going to be after this after the church ages he said john i can't talk to you down there no more listen god was saying i can't talk to you down there no more hallelujah because i've left down there i've come up higher now come up here with me amen amen and i'll show you what's going to take place here after oh my caught up in the vision caught up into glory hallelujah god gave the prophet ambition hallelujah and the bride of christ needs to be caught up in the vision that god gave him hallelujah up into glory amen this is a glorious message hallelujah we should be consumed amen by the revelation of this message hallelujah look at john he is revelated he has been summoned to come up higher the bride will have a higher revelation of the word we have we have we should have an insatiable hunger for more of the world hallelujah and we want to soar higher into the heavens like john we look not to this present day but to the day of the lord amen hallelujah ephesians chapter 2 verse 6 says he has raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus our thoughts should transcend the troubles of this world this present world we are looking away from the world unto jesus the author and the finisher of our faith hallelujah you see john was the disciple that was closest to the lord verbum said they're about the same age john was the youngest disciple they were about the same age maybe that's that's the factor that that draw them together um they have a lot of things in common they're of the same age and we read in the bible peter turning about seeing the disciple whom jesus loved following which also leaned on the breast on his breast at supper and said lord which is he that betrayed me you see john is always seen leaning on the bosom of the lord jesus christ never that close hallelujah if you see two guys being disclosed nowadays you question them right you have a question hallelujah but see they have this affection towards each other it's not a carnal affection it's the love of god hallelujah when you're that close to him you can hear his heart cry amen you can hear his love secrets as he whispers them to you you can hear his you can know his deepest desires question is are you staying close to the lord is your mind set on him do you mind heavenly things are you always reading his love letter to you have you been listening to the message do you have a decide to know more of him hallelujah do you like it when he whispers love secret to you secrets to you do you love it when he reveals his word to you hallelujah amen the bride shouldn't have to be told this is what the prophet said spoken word reveals fig here is the secret he said the word is in the bride and the mind of christ to know what he wants done with the word amen my and she does it in his name she does thus said the lord or she keeps still all right amen hallelujah the bride knows because she has the mind of christ all right amen hallelujah you don't have to keep on telling her because she knows what god once done with his word hallelujah that's right he has the ego anointing you know the four gospel writers they have four different kind of anointings hallelujah the four beasts of revelation chapter four and five hallelujah matches spoke of his kingship if you read matthew's gospel you seem to concentrate on the kingship of jesus that's why you can read his genealogy is traced back to david the king the son of david is called in matthew hallelujah why because matthew had the anointing of the lion lion is king hallelujah mark on the other hand recorded more of the things that jesus did right not so much what he said but what he did right he portrayed jesus as a priest a servant and that's the anointing of an ox of the ox the anointing hallelujah servant who and luke speaks about people portrays his humanity hallelujah because luke had the anointing of a man but john hallelujah he had the anointing of the ego amen that's why he could write in his gospel i and my father are one in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god if you've seen me you've seen the father the holy ghost is your comforter hallelujah i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you speaks of theophanies in my father's house are many mansions hallelujah if it were not so i would have told you you see can you see that john has a much higher revelation because he had the anointing of an eagle amen glory to god amen john was a prophet you know of all these four gospel writers john was a prophet hallelujah he wrote the book of revelation the last book of prophecy in the bible hallelujah see the ego is a heavenly creature if you notice the other three the other three beasts or anointings were all earthly creatures but the eagle is heavenly of all the beasts the eagle doesn't drink milk as an infant right all the three other bees they drink milk but the ego has an infant he already eats meat not just meat but fresh meat amen amen the strong meat of the word of god we read in the book of job chapter 39 verse 27 to 2029 where it says does the ego mount up at thy command and make her nest on high she dwelled and abided on the rock upon the crate of the rock the strong place from then she seeketh the prey and her eyes behold afar off verse 13 her young ones also suck up the blood and were the slain are there is she and these prophets are eagles amen hallelujah and the bible said where the newly slained animal is where the carcass is there the eagles will be gathered together hallelujah the eagles the eagle is able to soar high altitudes where pressure is so strong hallelujah the eagle dwells in the cleft of the rock amen up high in the mountain the eagle is faithful to her mate it is monogamous through life the ego is capable of renewing its strength amen so we can see that john was the most revelated of all gospel writers hallelujah and in john chapter 20 something strikes me as i read this because it speaks of the character of the regenerated john john chapter 20 verse four to eight so they ran both together and the other disciple did ultron peter and came first to the sepulcher the other disciple was john doesn't it interest you that john wrote the gospel of saint john and he doesn't mention his name in this gospel not one time did he mention his name he always refers to himself as the disciple which the lord who whom the lord love it than the other disciple but never mentioning his name it's his book but he's not mentioning his name hallelujah it shows something it's yours john's character hallelujah and he stooping down and looking in saw the linen clothes lying yet but he not in and then cometh simon peter following him and went into the talker and see it the linen clothes lie you see being younger he was able to outrun peter he came to the grave first but then look what happened the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes but wrapped together in a place by itself and then went in also the other disciple which came first to this sepoka and he saw and believed he came to the grave first but he waited for the older one to come in and then he came in right amen this shows humility this shows respect hallelujah this shows christian character come on hallelujah of being respectful to elders hallelujah you know what i've heard a lot of young ministers in the message and they run the older ones because they think they know more right of the message now than the older ones just because the older ones they cannot they don't know how to operate their computer but they know they know just how to do it so and i watch them they become disrespectful just because they know more that's not john i am hallelujah john was humble enough to wait for the elderly let him go into the simple curve first and then he went in amen to god one last point before we close in question to now answers hebrews 1957 brother said this about the 24 elders he said the four and 20 elders he said an elder is an overseer now noise they were 12 patriarchs and 12 apostles 12 and 12 is 24. that's the old testament chairs in the new testament church the elders of the old testament church are the 12 patriarchs the elders of the new testament chairs are the 12 original apostles can you see that hallelujah and there were twenty and four elders which were the twelve patriarchs on one side the old testament herban said in the 12 apostles on the other side of the new testament amen so you see john was one of the apostles therefore john was one of the elders do you see that amen say even if you do so he was one of the elders hallelujah in that setting the 24 elders were surrounding the throne of god john was was uh shown the vision of the throne of god in heaven there were 24 elders around the throne hallelujah and then barbara said this who is this melchizedek he said then after you recognize the word of god was eagle food then you left the other thing whatever it was we were feeding on out when we were back when we were still in the in the denomination after we heard the message and we recognize that it's eagle food batman said you've then been formed into the living image of the living god amen he said you heard from your theophany hallelujah if this earthly body be this hope he said we have one waiting therefore when we receive a revelation of the message that meant you heard from your theophany did you know john wept after he looked in the heavens on the earth under the earth and found no one that was worthy to open the book he wept the bible said hallelujah until one of the elders one of the elders told john hallelujah we not john because the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david has prevailed to open the book to take the book and open the seals thereof hallelujah and then john from weeping he changed to celebrating and praising god and rejoicing hallelujah till all the heavens all the angels in heaven shut up hallelujah right they were all praising god but then when john started praising verb kind of explained it hallelujah his voice of praise drowned down the praises of the angels in heaven oh my what joy what excitement amen hallelujah amen because one of the elders said with not john hallelujah amen no but did not say this but i'm just saying if you heard from your theophany and john heard one of the elders say weep not john and then he got so excited hallelujah because the seals have been open hallelujah because he knew if no one was found worthy to open the book then all mankind is doomed hallelujah but then when when he heard from his people come on hallelujah that changed the whole thing amen oh my i hope you see it amen all right man man you know in this last journey you go through trials and tests you go through a lot of tribulations in life hallelujah sometimes you become lonesome like john hallelujah and then you get reminded of the promises of god in his word and weeping changes into rejoicing embracing god right hallelujah why because you've heard from your theophany what is what is your theory by the way it's your word body but it's our representation in heaven if you're a believer your angel always beholds the face of the father in heaven you are represented in heaven your theophany is there hallelujah and when we need to be comforted in times of deep sorrow problems in life all we need to do is tune our hearing and hear from our theory be reminded of the promises of god hallelujah john was the youngest and the last apostle to die matter of fact he was the only apostle that didn't die a martyr's death right hallelujah he died of old age pastoring the church in ephesus he was faithful till the end amen amen one of the songs in this song book says will work till jesus comes will work revelations 1 verse 9 says i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the isle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ he was imprisoned and suffered for the word of god brother said he was trying to compile the new testament hallelujah that's why peter the oldest of all the apostles he was given the keys to the kingdom of heaven he was getting a little jealous of this young disciple hallelujah john 21 grieved me in verse 20 that peter turning about see the disciples whom jesus loved following which also leaned on his breasts that suffer and said lord which is he that betrayed me peter seeing him said to jesus lord what shall this man do lord i thought you give you gave me the keys of the kingdom of heaven i thought i was the man but what is this man doing he wouldn't leave your side he always wants to stay close to you but jesus said unto him if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to today follow theme hallelujah and then went the same there was gossip abroad amongst the brethren that the disciples should not die and yet jesus said not unto him he shall not die but if i will that he tarries till i come what is that today hallelujah of course jan john the divine died of old age hallelujah but because john types the bride jesus was saying what is it to me peter if i allow some people hallelujah to witness my coming in the end what is that to be if i allow by my sovereign will for some people not to taste that hallelujah what is left to defeat peter hallelujah if some people will see the coming of the lord alive come on hallelujah amen what is that to be peter if if this man terrorists will be of course we understand that it's the will of the lord that the bride will carry until the coming of the lord right amen we're still here come on i believe we'll see him coming we'll see him face to face will see the resurrection of the dead in christ hallelujah amen i believe will be lifted up by the power of god to meet him in the air thank you jesus this is the disciple which testified all these things and and wrote these things and we know that his testimony is true and there are also many other things which jesus did which if they should be written everyone i suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written amen the acts of jesus the deeds of jesus being written in a book come on hallelujah the book of acts what brown said she explained it it's actually not the acts of the apostles right it's a record of the act of the holy spirit in the lives of the apostles hallelujah and barbara said about that the orange tree if it ever puts forth an original branch hallelujah they will bring forth oranges hallelujah and and and then and they will write a book a book of acts behind them the holy spirit that does in each and every individual's life could be written in a book even the whole world cannot contain it amen because right now the biography autobiography of saint john is still being rude because john pipes the bride the bride will tarry until it comes they which are alive and remain shall be changed and be caught up together with them with those that are dead in christ to meet the lord in the air first corinthians 15 verse one verse first verse verses 51 and 52 says behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in a drinking tinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorrupt how do we run we are here hallelujah what are we here for right but we are here to manifest the life of the groom amen the life of the groom being manifested in the life of the bride we are here hallelujah to show the world that the lord has come amen in bright form amen the lord has come hallelujah the same life is being manifested that we are the life of his life flesh of his flesh born of his bone spirit of his spirit power of his power life of his life that we are him she is him hallelujah we are living in the days of revelation 10. we are living in the days of the opening of the seventh seal but i'm trusting that god is showing you your rightful position right right as i call them the mysticians get ready to worship god hallelujah i hope we can worship god like john after he heard that someone prevailed and was qualified was made worthy to take the book and break the skills thereof hallelujah because when you see the seals broken when you see the book open the bride of christ john saw his name in the book hallelujah i'm trusting you see your name in the book tonight even as we worship him amen hallelujah this will stand if you may feel deep please d me hallelujah tonight he touched me i'm i will leave you hallelujah me and now i know once again he touched me touch me oh let's praise him let's give him behind the tree we're trusting lord that you have spoken to every heart by this simple message lord jesus may you cause every individual that make up your bride in this assembly to see recognizes rightful position in christ hallelujah father i ask that you as we stand in your presence tonight and our hearts are open hallelujah take away all carnality may you truly lift our souls up into the heavens lord where you are hallelujah and let us not focus on the negatives lord or the trials and tests on the sins and darkness that surround us in this aid in this world today hallelujah help us to look to you let us hear from our theophany let every one of us realize lord that that we are connected to heaven we are connected to you hallelujah that this message has made us one with you hallelujah so that we know exactly what's in your mind hallelujah because you revealed everything in your word all your thoughts that you had even before the world began hallelujah you revealed in the message of the hour hallelujah and as we go through the valleys and the dark times in our lives hallelujah may we hear our theophany speak and maybe be like john who was strengthened with all might to be able to prophesy again hallelujah many towns and nations and peoples of the world hallelujah father we will keep on working until that last scene comes
