[0:00] you were not here Wednesday you need to
[0:02] listen to the
[0:04] p i see the DVD cuz what we were
[0:07] covering here for a little
[0:15] more many times you read the breef once
[0:18] twice two times I read it once well I
[0:22] listen to it well this when I say read I
[0:26] mean read in
[0:28] here
[0:33] all
[0:34] right act
[0:37] one what we're going to do
[0:40] is
[0:44] me you're real
[0:50] close what we're going to do
[0:53] is we're going to start in
[0:57] Act only you
[1:05] she really looked nice last
[1:07] night she looks nice today why she look
[1:10] nice last
[1:13] night at
[1:16] the we all had a had a wonderful
[1:23] time thank the Lord for our M all right
[1:25] acts one get before I was interrupting
[1:30] by
[1:31] the up here so
[1:33] close we're going to look like we were
[1:37] talking about Wednesday
[1:38] night the son of
[1:41] man in Matthew
[1:44] 17 was telling us that he was going to
[1:47] be risen again from the
[1:49] dead and we know that son of man died
[1:51] one time a natural physical
[1:55] death but the second time will be not
[1:58] will not be a natural physical death
[2:00] it'll be
[2:03] worse worse than a natural physical
[2:07] death because if somebody's alive and
[2:11] you count him dead and you take
[2:13] everything he's done and just do away
[2:15] with it but yet the Man still alive
[2:17] that's what denominations and Creeds and
[2:19] our ideas not just theirs has done to
[2:23] the son of man we buried him again like
[2:25] I said Wednesday night under Creeds and
[2:28] denominational doctrines and
[2:30] brandom doctrines and I don't mean the
[2:32] wrong I mean the right one I mean the
[2:34] ones we create that brother brandom
[2:37] didn't say all right around the message
[2:40] that's what's messing us up
[2:43] now but let's see what the last thing
[2:46] the son of man did before he left
[2:50] because remember that son of man which
[2:52] is God in human flesh will not be seen
[2:55] again on this Earth in a human flesh
[2:58] body until we come back with him in the
[3:01] Millennium right right so he's going to
[3:04] be somewhere else but he said in Matthew
[3:09] 17 the son of man had to be risen again
[3:13] before these things could happen right
[3:15] it's on before these things could come
[3:18] to pass so let's read the book of Acts
[3:22] 1 Jesus has been with him he had told
[3:26] him that all power in heaven and earth
[3:27] been given unto him he was still here
[3:30] for 30 40 days he was in a human flesh
[3:32] body walking through walls appearing
[3:36] disappearing exactly the same thing that
[3:38] you and I are going to be doing after
[3:40] the resurrection right so he's our he's
[3:44] our spiritual type but he's also our
[3:47] physical type he is he physically typed
[3:49] what you and I are going to be once the
[3:51] resurrection happens and the change in
[3:54] that 30 to 40 days before we go into
[3:56] Rapture that's exactly what Jesus walked
[3:58] through he was a human mortal man but he
[4:01] was Immortal he was mortal and he was
[4:03] made remember he went from mortality to
[4:05] immortality no man has ever achieved
[4:08] that no matter man has ever went from
[4:09] Mortal to Immortal now say what you will
[4:13] about Enoch and all those let's just
[4:16] understand what we need to understand
[4:18] all right Enoch walk with God for 500
[4:20] years if we walk close with God for 500
[4:23] years he'd probably take us in the r all
[4:25] right but we don't have 500
[4:28] years Ray and Kathy couldn't make it 500
[4:31] years
[4:34] together just
[4:36] Kidd not in the glorified body think
[4:39] that's why it say that only God and that
[4:43] is correct excuse me see Enoch is a
[4:47] type but Jesus wasn't a type he actually
[4:50] went through it right see Enoch's a type
[4:53] brother saying en's the type this one's
[4:55] the type this one's the type but Jesus
[4:57] Christ actually physically died
[5:00] his body was dead and now that body has
[5:04] been resurrected not just resurrected
[5:06] like Lazarus Lazarus was resurrected to
[5:08] a position and then he kept getting
[5:10] older and he died again Jesus Christ
[5:13] raised the Bible said once for
[5:15] all when he raised he'll never die
[5:19] again and he said I'm alive for what
[5:22] ever more all right and have the key of
[5:25] death in hell so he's got all the power
[5:28] he physically went down and he
[5:30] physically rose up so that body is now
[5:32] Immortal now in the chains that's
[5:34] exactly what's going to happen to you
[5:36] and I because we have to become immortal
[5:39] to get out of here right all right the
[5:41] only reason he ascended on this day just
[5:43] like this right here was because he was
[5:45] Immortal he was a mortal man that had
[5:48] become immortal there had been a change
[5:50] right and where did he come from inside
[5:55] right son of man died Son of God went to
[5:58] hell and preached to the souls in prison
[6:00] that Spirit man Spirit
[6:02] God theophany eternal life went and
[6:06] preached to the souls in prison come
[6:08] back up to Paradise picked up the dead
[6:09] Saints and sent them on to Glory he come
[6:13] back and and steep right down in that
[6:15] body on the third day quickened that
[6:18] body raised it up out of the ground
[6:20] remember Romans 8 says the spirit that
[6:22] was what in Jesus Christ it dwells in
[6:24] you it'll also Quicken your mortal
[6:27] body not not your soul Soul's already
[6:30] quickened by the new birth he said it'll
[6:31] Quicken your mortal body and then what
[6:34] change it just like it did with with
[6:36] Jesus Christ all right so let's read the
[6:38] book of Acts this is the last thing that
[6:40] happened to the son of man before he
[6:42] ascended but remember he
[6:44] promised that he was going to be buried
[6:47] again cuz he said when a son of man is
[6:50] risen again from the
[6:52] dead all right one time he was risen
[6:56] before this book of Acts right he was
[6:59] risen on the third day right 30 40 days
[7:02] later that's why they called the day of
[7:04] Pentecost cuz Jesus actually remember
[7:06] how we went through the timeline Jesus
[7:08] actually resurrected and it was exactly
[7:10] 50 days he said go ter in Jerusalem if
[7:13] he was there 30 or 40 days he give them
[7:16] about 10 or so more days right here and
[7:18] told him to go to Jerusalem you'll be
[7:21] endued with power from on high very 50th
[7:24] day that day of Jubilee the 50 days
[7:27] after that man Resurrected he came back
[7:29] on the day of Pentecost in what Spirit
[7:32] form again Son of God came back
[7:35] everybody understand that either shake
[7:36] your head or say Amen okay all
[7:40] right because if he
[7:43] hadn't he could not come back as a son
[7:45] of man
[7:47] again in the physical
[7:51] form because of Luke 17:30 what we read
[7:55] last Sunday and what we read Wednesday
[7:57] night that's what barred him from coming
[7:59] by back because it had to be in the days
[8:01] of Noah as it was in the days of lot as
[8:03] it was in the days of all these people
[8:06] well that wasn't that day that was this
[8:08] day so there had to be a group of people
[8:11] on the Earth today to accept that all
[8:15] right when the coming of the son of man
[8:18] when he would be risen again from the
[8:21] dead what dead works you know remember
[8:23] brother R said there was 68 million Jews
[8:26] killed during the Dark Ages he said told
[8:30] billions spiritually died see so it's
[8:33] worse to be spiritually dead than to be
[8:35] naturally dead
[8:37] right cuz what it is is the Bible says
[8:40] you're alive but you're dead and don't
[8:42] know it right I mean you're you're
[8:44] you're physically alive but you're just
[8:46] as dead as the door Nowell that's worse
[8:49] than just go ahead and you know giving
[8:51] your life for the gospel maybe what
[8:52] brother B said about being naked in the
[8:55] Bible right naked don't even know yeah
[8:58] you're naked and and somebody tells you
[9:00] and you realize it what a wonderful
[9:02] thing you can put your clothes back on
[9:04] but being naked and not knowing it like
[9:06] they are in the end time that's
[9:08] worse all right book of
[9:12] Acts this is Luke speaking let's
[9:16] start let's just start verse one the
[9:18] former treaties have I made o theopus of
[9:21] all that Jesus began both to do and
[9:23] teach until the day in which he was
[9:25] taken up after that he through the Holy
[9:27] Ghost had given Commandments and to the
[9:29] apostles whom he had chosen to whom also
[9:32] he showed himself alive after his
[9:34] passion for many infallible proof by
[9:36] many in fallible proof being seen of
[9:39] them 40 days and speaking of the things
[9:42] pertaining to the kingdom of
[9:45] God and being assembled together with
[9:47] them commanded them that they should not
[9:49] depart from Jerusalem but wait for the
[9:51] promise of the Father which was what go
[9:53] back to St John
[9:55] 14 St John 14 says I'll send you another
[9:59] comforter I and my father are one we're
[10:01] going to come and take our Abode in you
[10:03] that's bringing the what the baptism of
[10:06] the Holy Ghost into the hearts of the
[10:08] believer that was the promise of the
[10:11] father remember Jesus said my father
[10:13] whoever he chooses there's not one you
[10:15] know in other words you won't miss one
[10:16] of
[10:18] them wait for the promise of the Father
[10:21] which he say you have heard of me which
[10:23] was the 3 and 1/2 years that he preached
[10:25] for John truly baptized with water but
[10:27] you shall be baptized with a Holy Ghost
[10:29] not many days hence see the Holy Ghost
[10:32] had not been given yet sure John
[10:35] received the Holy Ghost in his mother's
[10:36] womb but that didn't make him a born
[10:37] again believer right he was just
[10:39] quickened by the Holy Ghost
[10:42] right and I don't mean that just cuz he
[10:44] was one of the greatest he was the
[10:45] greatest of the Prophet but Jesus didn't
[10:49] stop there he said but this Kingdom my
[10:52] father's fixing to set up he's not even
[10:54] in
[10:55] it the least in the kingdom is greater
[10:58] than that man call John the leash the
[11:01] little the toenail the fingernail
[11:02] whatever you want to call it the body of
[11:05] Christ for John through the baptized
[11:07] with water but you shall be baptized
[11:08] with the Holy Ghost not many days hence
[11:11] when they therefore will come together
[11:13] they ask of him saying Lord will thou at
[11:15] this time restore again the Kingdom of
[11:18] Israel what are they they're still in a
[11:21] natural condition they're saying okay
[11:25] you said you were going to bring this
[11:26] Kingdom you said you were going to rule
[11:28] you were going to reign you going to do
[11:30] these
[11:30] things when's it going to
[11:33] happen I wrote in my Bible they didn't
[11:35] know cuz they didn't have the Holy Ghost
[11:37] that's right they heard the word just
[11:40] like a lot of us do we like I said
[11:42] Wednesday night this cannot be head
[11:44] knowledge head knowledge will kill you
[11:45] that is where the death is death is in
[11:48] head knowledge right right this has got
[11:51] to be made alive in somebody's life amen
[11:54] all right because here's the group of
[11:57] people for 3 and 1/2 years God himself
[12:00] walked face to
[12:01] face he told them things that they
[12:04] didn't know about and then sometimes
[12:05] there was things that he explained to
[12:07] them and they said oh we understand
[12:09] that and right here before the greatest
[12:12] happening he had just resurrected from
[12:15] the dead told him what he was going to
[12:17] do son of man be put in the earth three
[12:20] days and three nights he'll
[12:22] resurrect they were there they were a
[12:25] witness this man walked for them for 40
[12:27] days and they still ask him this
[12:30] question
[12:33] right they still ask him this
[12:37] question are you still going to restore
[12:39] the kingdom to
[12:41] Israel what Jesus say it is not for you
[12:45] to know the time or the seasons which
[12:47] the father hath put in his own
[12:50] power but ye shall receive power
[12:54] everybody say this with me
[12:57] after Holy Ghost has come upon you
[13:01] that's good enough
[13:04] after not now or they wouldn't ask that
[13:07] question after that the Holy Ghost has
[13:10] come upon you and you shall be Witnesses
[13:12] unto me both in Jerusalem and Judea and
[13:15] Samaria and into the uttermost parts of
[13:17] the earth and that's where this is now
[13:19] this is the uttermost parts of the earth
[13:21] and when he had spoken these things
[13:23] while they beheld he was taken up and a
[13:25] cloud received him out of their sight
[13:28] all right so he he's going up where he's
[13:29] going up in a cloud and he
[13:31] disappears that correct right he goes up
[13:35] in a cloud he disappears that's how he
[13:39] left right now and while they look
[13:43] steadfast toward Heaven as he went up
[13:46] behold two men stood by them in white
[13:49] apparel which also said ye men of
[13:52] Galilee why stand ye gazing up in
[13:56] heaven if you remember Wednesday night
[13:58] that's what denomination that everybody
[14:00] all the ball players and everybody's
[14:02] like hey thank you Lord thank you God
[14:05] thank you God you know start pointing up
[14:06] in heaven it's not bad to point it's not
[14:09] bad to pray this way but
[14:12] why he's in your
[14:14] heart he's not anywhere else but
[14:17] there he's not in your heart I don't
[14:20] know that but I know he's in mine
[14:22] they're doing that for other people
[14:23] though they want other people to see
[14:25] right that they're but their
[14:27] understanding is too that there's some
[14:28] great God way out you under somewhere
[14:32] that just come down and scored a
[14:33] touchdown for him
[14:35] right but yet he's still up y under
[14:37] somewhere you
[14:40] know and and you know not making light
[14:42] of them
[14:44] but I don't you know brother way but
[14:47] it's serious I mean they don't
[14:49] understand there's your dead but yet
[14:51] physically alive I I don't think I've
[14:53] seen myself there I've seen myself if I
[14:56] we that way and here here he just walks
[15:00] right off the Earth and we're looking up
[15:01] in the clouds we know he just stepped
[15:03] through a Dimensions what he do sure
[15:04] absolutely you sitting there looking and
[15:06] I'm just thinking pow in the back of the
[15:09] head go do what he told you to do and
[15:11] that's that's what I did
[15:13] right many times but now did that solve
[15:18] the
[15:20] problem they still ran into a room and
[15:22] shut the doors and closed the windows
[15:25] and barred up everything and and and
[15:28] didn't move cuz they were for fear of
[15:32] the people to kill them well if they
[15:34] don't know you know they haven't been
[15:36] thought so I guess they're not going to
[15:37] be judged for they got to be judged for
[15:39] what they know right well the last thing
[15:43] they have to prove what they are that's
[15:45] all I'm going to say no I don't they
[15:48] ain't no more Christians in that Chari
[15:49] is if their lives don't prove it but um
[15:52] anyway Listen People this got to be a
[15:54] life that's right we're coming down to a
[15:56] life right that's if we don't can't if
[15:59] we can't if we don't smoke drink cuss
[16:02] run around and do those things and God's
[16:05] going to we're just going to barely make
[16:07] it God's not going to wink at that
[16:09] anymore this is the day that's why y'all
[16:11] missed it Wednesday night I'm telling
[16:14] you people this is the time where we
[16:15] walk down a narrow
[16:18] pathway and few the Bible said will be
[16:21] that find
[16:23] it this message come to Quicken a people
[16:26] to get out of here there are no
[16:28] Christians on this earth except you and
[16:30] I amen I'm
[16:32] sorry I don't care how good your mom and
[16:34] daddy is that's right how good my mom
[16:36] and dad is if you're not born again
[16:39] you're on the outside of the economy of
[16:42] all this Bible right here
[16:44] right and brother Joel that's true I
[16:47] mean they'll be
[16:48] judged but how are they going to be
[16:52] judged this right here right that's
[16:56] right and if you'll look in the news
[16:58] paper and look on the internet a few
[16:59] times you'll see how them ball players
[17:01] live and it ain't Godly until they score
[17:05] touchdown
[17:07] so I
[17:10] get but
[17:11] anyway I want you to realize one thing
[17:14] I'm not trying to be mean but God come
[17:16] to get one group of people and that's
[17:18] all that's right that's
[17:20] all now that'd be like me coming to get
[17:23] June and and and taking Lisa in my house
[17:26] and Rebecca in my house and and and
[17:29] being husband and wife all three God
[17:31] didn't do
[17:33] that I don't do that so I know God's not
[17:36] going to do that God come to find one
[17:40] person that's a bride
[17:43] one not two not three one CH and if
[17:49] everybody else is dead then it's just
[17:51] you and I and everybody else it's and
[17:54] I'm you know I'm saying look let me tell
[17:56] you something let me get a little closer
[17:58] you said said well the message is the
[17:59] only thing that's right no the Holy
[18:01] Ghost is the only thing that's
[18:03] right okay that's what I said about head
[18:06] knowledge Wednesday night pray to God
[18:08] this is not head knowledge because being
[18:10] so close to this amen and not doing what
[18:12] it says you're in worse shape than if
[18:14] you never heard it before right you'd
[18:17] have a better chance like brother Joe
[18:19] said to go God nobody ever told me about
[18:23] you nobody because remember brother R
[18:25] said we will be held accountable the
[18:27] bride will be held held accountable
[18:29] right for not going to the people and
[18:32] telling them about the true meaning of
[18:33] Jesus Christ I just go out there and
[18:35] give them a d confession but a true
[18:37] meaning well the only way I know to do
[18:39] it is a life
[18:41] live you know and I know the the young
[18:45] adults last night we had Valentine's
[18:48] dinner and the young adults got to
[18:50] see a lot of how us couples interact you
[18:54] know as husband and wife and the things
[18:57] we said to each other through that
[18:58] little piece of paper right really you
[19:01] know and I I made a joke they're back
[19:03] there in the back wall going you know
[19:06] cuz it was kind of mushy and it was lydy
[19:08] and it was but it was some it was funny
[19:10] my bassb
[19:13] babe but it some but it was an
[19:15] interaction though that the children
[19:17] what if you know then take them we're a
[19:21] little off the subject but this is the
[19:22] way we're going take them and go put
[19:25] them in a worldly Valentine's party yeah
[19:28] oh my
[19:29] word where there's drinking and and
[19:32] cursing and women and all wanting to be
[19:35] with the you know other men and men want
[19:37] to be with other women and and them
[19:39] wanting to be liars and and drunks and
[19:41] stuff put them over there in that
[19:43] situation and you look what you
[19:45] got you know we just hope they see the
[19:48] difference that's what you're trying to
[19:50] do yes I just hope that they see the and
[19:52] if they can't see the difference then
[19:53] God help us
[19:55] that's God help us if they can't can't
[19:58] see the death right absolutely I mean
[20:01] it's a life live you can sit up here you
[20:03] know Daddy could be preaching for 50
[20:04] years and if he lived like the devil
[20:06] then that 50 years was just counting for
[20:08] nothing right it's the life that we live
[20:12] it's going I told yall a long time ago
[20:13] I've always remember this when I started
[20:15] preaching I said it's going to come down
[20:16] to a life live it's not going to be that
[20:17] you can quote this seal book or that you
[20:19] can make brother Brown said this and
[20:21] brother Brown said that it's going to be
[20:22] a life that you live right and if you
[20:25] don't got the goods one day you're fall
[20:29] off one day you may not for 40 years but
[20:32] one day you're going to fall now to
[20:35] prove that you're not right you stay
[20:37] falling off now that doesn't mean like
[20:39] sister Trudy and I were talking about if
[20:41] you fall and get back up that means
[20:43] you're a Son of God that means you're a
[20:45] daughter of God we all fall off but when
[20:48] you get back on that path and start
[20:51] again I'd rather see that a lot of times
[20:53] and some people that's that's
[20:54] Untouchable seems like that they never
[20:55] do anything wrong just wait
[20:58] the devil will be right there at the
[21:00] door and he won't be far away do had to
[21:03] hand I was just thinking so many times
[21:06] though with what you're saying the life
[21:08] live people turn it into Works sure they
[21:12] turn it into Works in this message sure
[21:15] oh yeah absolutely they absolutely turn
[21:17] it into works but I'm telling you the
[21:18] ones that turn it into Works somewhere
[21:20] they're going to fall cuz if you build
[21:23] your house on Sand it will eventually
[21:25] fall if you build it on work do this
[21:28] don't do that don't do this do this we
[21:30] don't do
[21:32] this and you'll fall somewhere they may
[21:35] not fall for 50 years but somewhere they
[21:37] got to fall if they don't have the goods
[21:39] now if you got the goods I take that
[21:41] from Brother Claude he says it all the
[21:42] time he this gu to got the goods you
[21:45] know but if you got the goods yeah
[21:48] you'll stumble and fall but you get
[21:49] right back on
[21:50] track you won't stay away from church
[21:53] don't tell me you backslide for 25 years
[21:55] no you never got it to start with you
[21:57] that pull you back up that's exactly
[21:59] they fall they don't got right anybody
[22:02] fall and and and you're gone from church
[22:04] three or four five a year six months you
[22:08] didn't get the Holy Ghost you need to
[22:09] come back and get the Holy
[22:11] Ghost then if you fall you may fall and
[22:14] and the best thing to do when you fall
[22:15] is get right back in church get right
[22:18] back in the word of God just say Satan
[22:20] you got one brother R said Satan's got
[22:23] one one punch he didn't say two though
[22:27] thank God he did one punch now y'all
[22:30] think we're off the track but
[22:31] Revelations
[22:32] 5 there was a man took a book right and
[22:36] he had blood all over him that's right
[22:39] what blood was that that blood is what
[22:41] covers what I'm talking about right now
[22:43] that covers our past
[22:45] life because the lamb is the one that
[22:48] took the book now when that lamb takes a
[22:49] book and goes and sits on the throne he
[22:51] becomes the
[22:53] judge right he becomes the
[22:56] judge so then the world is going to be
[22:58] judged by what that's right you and
[23:02] I so that's him taking the book brother
[23:07] Brown said and we're going to read it
[23:08] maybe seven horns and seven eyes which
[23:10] is the church ages that lamb had seven
[23:13] horns and seven eyes what it was the
[23:15] Bride of Jesus Christ in symbol formed
[23:17] by one man the lamb the one that took
[23:20] the book we're going to read that before
[23:21] we before we leave today we're going to
[23:22] read Revelation 5 been about 4 weeks
[23:25] trying to get to it and while they look
[23:27] steadfast toward him as he went up
[23:28] behold two men stood by them in white
[23:31] apparel got slow down out of breath too
[23:38] fat nobody had enough sense to say
[23:44] amen I heard it under your breath that's
[23:47] okay oh that's right we're on internet
[23:50] which also said ye men of Galilee I told
[23:52] them they need to get one of them
[23:54] cameras that like them Spaghetti
[23:56] Westerns you know make them like Clint
[23:58] Eastwood look about 8 ft
[24:01] tall but if I turn this way Joe said he
[24:04] said be this
[24:08] way little humor to kind of break it up
[24:11] a little bit which also said you men of
[24:14] Galilee why stand you gazing up into
[24:16] heaven in other words why are you
[24:18] looking for this man out under somewhere
[24:22] he told you to go to Jerusalem right
[24:24] here and you would be endued with power
[24:27] from on high and you're going to do the
[24:29] same works that I did you going to do
[24:31] also and they're still going he's
[24:34] leaving he's leaving
[24:37] us he's going he's supposed to restore
[24:39] the kingdom he's supposed to come
[24:41] back with
[24:43] power but now remember they didn't stay
[24:46] that way about 10 days later that man
[24:50] that left came back in the form of the
[24:53] Holy Ghost it wasn't that man the son of
[24:54] man it was that man the spirit of that
[24:57] was in that man come back on the people
[25:01] to what give them power and Buddy when
[25:03] they did the doors open they didn't care
[25:05] who saw them they didn't care who saw
[25:08] their life because remember when they
[25:10] went to Antioch they were first called
[25:12] Christians because they acted like Paul
[25:14] no cuz they acted like Peter no they
[25:17] acted like
[25:19] Christ
[25:21] Christian excuse me this same Jesus now
[25:25] they'd have to be lying if he didn't
[25:26] come back
[25:28] this same
[25:32] Jesus this same
[25:35] man that you saw
[25:37] leing which is taken up from you into
[25:40] heaven shall so come in like manner as
[25:43] you have seen him go into
[25:47] heaven now there
[25:49] went the son of man off of the face of
[25:53] the Earth never to be seen again in a
[25:56] physical form right until he comes back
[26:00] with a bride in the Millennium right
[26:02] right but now wait a
[26:05] minute Matthew 17 says Jesus said when
[26:08] the son of man's risen again these
[26:10] things are going to
[26:13] happen maybe he's talking about
[26:15] something here that's what I wanted to
[26:17] get
[26:18] to in Revelations 10 we see that
[26:23] same
[26:25] scenario an angel coming out of the
[26:29] clouds come down to a prophet on Sunset
[26:31] Mountain that's right to bring a
[26:36] message not the son of man in physical
[26:39] form but he hid himself in
[26:42] Simplicity in a man called William
[26:44] Brandon
[26:46] amen he hid himself in that man and
[26:50] brought a message from 1963 to
[26:54] 1965 that was the same message that you
[26:56] read in Matthew Mark Luke and John but
[27:01] one other scenario the unwritten
[27:04] part that's the part we're going to get
[27:06] into but we must have a basis of why
[27:10] that the prophet had to come to a
[27:12] position why because the scriptures told
[27:14] him he had to I mean who of us ever read
[27:19] Revelations 10:1 and saw a mighty angel
[27:22] coming down and know it was Christ we
[27:23] just thought listen let's be honest
[27:26] Revelations 10: 101 says this Mighty
[27:29] Angel come down that's a little
[27:30] a Now you listen to brother brandom he
[27:33] tell you he said if that's a little a he
[27:34] said that's an Earthly
[27:36] messenger but then you see Revelations
[27:38] 10:7 you got an angel on earth a little
[27:42] a god hid that from the
[27:46] people God hid that angel cuz brother R
[27:50] said only Christ it could be right to me
[27:54] it would be a big a cuz that's Christ
[27:56] right the big a would have took the
[27:58] scholars right to that big a where it
[28:00] says Angel like it does the Lord and
[28:02] Jesus and all the capital letters
[28:04] remember we saw in the in the
[28:07] Bible but he hit it in a little a and it
[28:11] took a prophet to come and say that was
[28:14] Christ the that's my identification that
[28:16] Christ come back down and started
[28:18] preaching a message that he left
[28:21] off when he come the first time he said
[28:25] it's finished he said it's done but
[28:27] there's a part in there that man has
[28:29] never looked
[28:30] at remember brother bandam when that
[28:32] sister had a dream about he whipped that
[28:35] top off of that pyramid mountain with a
[28:38] crowbar he said when he looked down in
[28:40] there he said it was things that man had
[28:42] never looked at
[28:45] before and what did he do first thing he
[28:47] done he come back he went to Tucson and
[28:49] then he went to Jeffersonville to preach
[28:50] the seal right you said oh that's
[28:53] wonderful that's it is wonderful to see
[28:55] the the acts of a play see this isn't
[28:57] actual a play but they actually took
[29:00] place in our
[29:02] town the whole pie to this thing
[29:07] everybody would listen is those people
[29:11] back there did not need what he looked
[29:14] into that's right because they did not
[29:17] have their body and spirit did not have
[29:20] to be right taken up or change cuz they
[29:23] were in another age their age counted
[29:26] them to go to the Grave
[29:27] that wasn't the time for that right had
[29:29] to be in the seventh days of the voice
[29:31] of the seventh angel that's the
[29:33] identification the days of the voice
[29:36] that's the key which the voice is
[29:38] sounding now in what remember all those
[29:41] Messengers remember we preach daddy
[29:43] preached I preached about the messenger
[29:44] coming at the end of the age to preach a
[29:46] message for the next age well a lot of
[29:48] times he'd be dead 50 years into his age
[29:51] of the last 500 years well who took that
[29:53] message on the people his voice that's
[29:57] right Paul died in what ad60 something
[30:00] his his message I mean his Ephesus
[30:02] Church age lasted several hundred more
[30:04] years well it was what Paul
[30:07] preached in the people right is what
[30:10] brought the people to the age of
[30:12] Ephesians right right same way with
[30:15] brother brandom he had to go off the
[30:17] scene right for us to even be able to
[30:20] understand because we would actually
[30:22] looked at him and said you're the one
[30:23] that's going to do it that would have
[30:25] exalted him to deity right Right One
[30:28] Singular deity now I think we're all
[30:29] deity and he was deity as far as a new
[30:31] birth everybody that's got a new birth
[30:33] he said that's he said you have deity
[30:34] residing inside of you right but when he
[30:36] whipped that top off it was not that
[30:39] that was strange things that had that
[30:42] that that was not there before cuz God
[30:45] can't add or take away it was always
[30:48] written there right he said light had
[30:50] just not shined on it until now so
[30:53] there's not some new mystery we're not
[30:55] going to learn something new that you
[30:56] going to write down and say boy we know
[30:57] something the world don't know well we
[30:59] do know something the world don't know
[31:00] that's right but it's living that that's
[31:04] right living this to its fullest extent
[31:07] let's go to Revelation 5 we're going to
[31:08] read it
[31:11] today we're going to get to it after a
[31:13] month did your Dy go ahead while we're
[31:14] doing
[31:15] it what I'm seeing with him within that
[31:18] top office you have to come up to that
[31:20] place for absolutely he had to be
[31:23] standing right here whip that top off
[31:26] that's right yeah he couldn't whip the
[31:27] top off down here that's right he had to
[31:30] be standing right here to cut take that
[31:33] crowbar and pull that top off to see
[31:35] what down in here what the bride in the
[31:40] ages these Birches been left off exactly
[31:44] he told him to stay there too exactly he
[31:47] said you stay here and I'll go yep he
[31:49] said stay here and I'll go cuz he what
[31:51] he's the one that had the message he was
[31:53] that seventh angel messenger that had
[31:55] the message he connected with those
[31:57] Angels we'll get to it later but we're
[31:58] going to read Revelation
[31:59] 5 Revelation 5 and I saw in the right
[32:02] hand of him that sat on the throne a
[32:04] book written within and on the backside
[32:06] seal with Seven Seals now next Sunday
[32:07] the Lord willing we're going to try to
[32:09] put this in picture form kind of draw it
[32:11] on the board what went on the
[32:14] scene read the breach brother rown calls
[32:16] it a scene it's a scene right seal what
[32:20] Seven Seals and I saw a strong Angel
[32:22] Proclaim with a loud voice who is worthy
[32:24] to open the book and loose the seals
[32:25] thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in
[32:27] Earth neither under the Earth was able
[32:29] to open the book neither to look there
[32:31] on and I wept much because no man was
[32:33] found worthy to open and read the book
[32:34] neither to look there
[32:36] on and one of the elders said unto me
[32:38] weep not behold the line of the tribe of
[32:40] Judah the root of David hath prevailed
[32:42] to open the book and to loose the seals
[32:46] thereof he overcame something the
[32:48] prophet said seven because he Pro he
[32:50] prevailed to loose the Seven Seals
[32:52] thereof and I beheld in low in the midst
[32:54] of the Throne of the four beast and in
[32:56] the midst of the Elder stood a lamb and
[32:57] they had been slain having seven horns
[33:00] and seven eyes what the church
[33:03] ages the bride he is in Bride
[33:07] form there's no way for you to be
[33:09] redeemed
[33:10] today there's no way for you to receive
[33:13] the Holy Ghost now this may hurt a
[33:14] little bit there's no one has the Holy
[33:17] Ghost in This age I don't believe unless
[33:20] they hear this word of God being
[33:22] preached in it pure
[33:23] form how are you going to get I know
[33:25] brother R said you can put an under a
[33:27] puppy maybe that was for his time but
[33:30] when we come down to this part right
[33:31] here where we're looking at at going in
[33:33] a Rapture taking a body chain it's not a
[33:35] puppy dog sitting on an egg that's right
[33:37] right it's a baby being born from a
[33:40] human right all right that's right I'm
[33:43] not trying to be different with the
[33:44] prophet there's a lot of things he said
[33:46] that continued in an age but it stopped
[33:48] when he started preaching those seals
[33:49] everybody thought he went off and went
[33:50] crazy no that Bible became a new book he
[33:54] didn't change his Doctrine he just Rose
[33:57] up just it just raised up a little bit
[33:58] higher all right let's
[34:00] finish and I beheld in L in the midst of
[34:02] the Throne of the four beasts and in the
[34:03] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[34:05] had been slain what he was doing the
[34:08] work of a
[34:09] redeemer there's only one way you can
[34:11] get born again even through the church
[34:13] Ages was through another Born Again
[34:15] believer coming in contact with you are
[34:18] you hearing the word of God from another
[34:20] believer why why did Cornelius and all
[34:24] those people were preaching the word of
[34:26] God in the book of
[34:27] Rel the Holy Ghost couldn't fall on them
[34:30] until Peter a man filled with the Holy
[34:33] Ghost walks into the
[34:35] room and the Bible says the Holy Ghost
[34:38] fell on the people Peter spake the word
[34:41] because the life only comes through the
[34:43] body how you going to get life from
[34:45] Death right you can't get life from from
[34:49] from these people out in the world that
[34:51] are great teachers if they don't have
[34:53] the Holy Ghost it's dead letter that's
[34:55] right you're not I mean you might learn
[34:57] something for your physical life or
[34:58] something for your human life but for
[35:00] your spiritual life outside of this
[35:02] message people you're not going to
[35:03] understand you're not going to get that
[35:04] word's not going to be
[35:06] quickened you understand that yes
[35:09] without the Holy Ghost to Quicken it
[35:11] life has to come through the body so
[35:12] somebody has to tell me about the word
[35:14] of God God quickens that to my heart I
[35:18] can't hear from a sinner and get born
[35:19] again you can't do that all right so
[35:22] don't think you can go to a Pentecostal
[35:24] church that has that has no belief at
[35:26] all and get the Holy Ghost you can't do
[35:28] that you can't especially not in this
[35:34] age may not believe that but I believe
[35:37] it that's just how I'm I guess I'm
[35:40] dogmatic about the message but still I
[35:43] see that where life is there's no life
[35:46] outside of this message being lived in a
[35:49] born again believer just John real quick
[35:51] oh no no no I disagree with oh you
[35:53] disagreeing okay s can't finger up and
[35:55] agree that's why Jamaica they agree with
[35:57] boy this message revealed exactly seven
[36:01] horns and seven eyes which is who
[36:03] identified in the church ages you and I
[36:06] we're the only one that are
[36:08] redeemable he's the only one that died
[36:12] he died for us
[36:14] only oh no he died for the whole
[36:17] world but only the ones that accept him
[36:20] is the one that's going to be covered by
[36:21] the blood all right having seven horn
[36:24] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[36:25] of God sent forth into all the Earth and
[36:27] he came and took the book who a man the
[36:30] prophet said M the son of man had to
[36:33] take the
[36:35] book he came and took the book out of
[36:38] the right hand of him that sat upon the
[36:39] throne we'll stop right there because
[36:42] that lamb was the son of man behold John
[36:46] said the Lamb of God had take away the
[36:47] sin of the world who was it Jesus Christ
[36:49] stand in human form on the shores of
[36:52] Galilee one more thing it bothers me
[36:54] that that he's in the B are not
[36:57] capitalized when you're talking about
[36:59] he's hiding it he's hiding it from the
[37:01] wise and prudent okay let's
[37:05] go
