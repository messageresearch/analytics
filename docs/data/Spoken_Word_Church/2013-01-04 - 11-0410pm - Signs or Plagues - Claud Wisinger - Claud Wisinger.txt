long ago two of the sisters laid hands on me and prayed for me and before I got seated that was gone so thankful thank you so now if the rest of you would just pray that I have a voice I've just about quit singing and I I mean we got so many good singers in this church so I just don't sing out much anymore and I just appreciate it if youd pray for me because if you don't use it you lose it and that's the truth that's right um how many of you remember when you were saved when you accepted Christ in your lives amen I was sitting over there and I was thinking a few minutes ago my mom and dad used to have a quartet and I've been drugging every Baptist Church on the other side of Atlanta since I was just a little bitty thing and they used to sit my sister and myself up on a piano stool and we would do Duets and then their quartet would sing and that's where I learned the love of God in music and then one night mom and dad were off someplace and I was just probably about 9 years no I was 12 and the church I went to the Baptist Church was right across the street so I just walked over there by myself you know and that night the Lord came into my heart he touched my soul and I remember all of a sudden I just bursted out to crying and just that wonderful feeling of everything you know what you felt like when you accepted Christ and as years have gone on I'm 72 years I'm 72 years old now excuse me and I have seen so much I really never got into very much I mean when you accept the Lord at 12 you don't get into a whole lot through your teenager years some maybe some things but nothing really bad and I got to thinking you know we've tried a lot of things you try the love of a man the love of a woman the love of your children uh the love of the world the love of everything on Earth but this song is it touches my heart and it's page 327 in the spile book and sing with me and it's in key of D I think and I'm going to start with A Chorus and then I'll go with the verses but this is the song of my heart only Jesus can satisfy yourself only Jesus can satisfy you and only can change your life and make you home we give you peace you never so we love and joy and to for ho Jesus safy you try to satisfy the long in your soul you may search the wide world on but you will be just as before you'll never find your satisfaction until you fell alone for only Jesus canide this

know you getting old you get your feet hey that's I'm serious you get your feet tangled up and everything amen let's all stand now we change the serice you need to come in come ahead enjoy the message this morning looking forward to this afternoon we believe it we appreciate brother CL coming being with us we sister jender coming and have a good time fellowshipping together that's the main thing but let's just sing and get ready because what we come for to hear the word faith comes by hearing hearing by the word we're in the aisle the son of man so that's the word made flesh amen so let's just sing it Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see you Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes eyes of my heart I want to see see to the reveal word don't you I want to see and how do you want to see to see you high and lifted up Shing in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy I lifted up high and lifted up shining in the light Your Glory pour out you power and love and we sing holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy I glory amen I want to see you isn't that what I said this morning that's what every man woman whoever you are if you're a Christian you always want to see God is that right that's why we've came here to this afternoon is to see him hear from him uh I appreciate it you're always a a very good congregation to preach to like I've said when people are well taught it's not hard to minister to that congregation at all uh so I just want to tell brother Samuel thank you uh he's been a real blessing to me and uh brother Wade also I enjoy getting brother Wade out you know brother Wade he tells me one thing and he gripes when I do it you know because uh when I was work I retired February the 25th I I've been with an oil company for 34 years and was able to retire but uh you know he always grapped at me while I was preaching and working I invite a visiting preacher every two weeks well he said well you need to do more preaching and so you know I've tried to do that in the last year even though I was still working do more preaching and every time I comes he grabs at me says well you don't have me out very often it's like you know this guy can confuse me so bad sometimes but you know you're the one that told me to do more preaching so now I'm doing more preaching and it kind of cuts him out of the picture right then he grabs cuz I don't invite him more so I was going to let him know it's not my fault I mean I just was doing what he told me to do okay so that's kind of way it works for us sometimes don't it but I I really enjoy ministering here and and uh the Lord has really blessed me the last four years that's right um and not to leave you standing I'm sorry but actually uh I said as a deacon in a church with brother Jess for 20 years uh 25 or 26 years ago I was in a charismatic church and a lady actually prophesied over me and said and she didn't know I was fasting at that time and asking God for more obedience she and she came and she prophesied over she said well you're you're walking obedient This Night in Heaven before God and she said and you're called into the ministry well me and my wife we got in the truck and and I told her I said I looked at her I said well she was half right because you just when you're a minister you fight it do you understand what I'm saying it's the last thing uh you know no preacher feels like they do a good job every service I've ever preached people would tell you and I joke with the people at home I said sometimes I go back out the back door and people Pat me on back say I really enjoyed that in my mind I say were they in the same Serv I was because as a preacher you never feel like you do a good job or you you you study and you have these wonderful quotes and you never seem to cover all the quotes you know what I mean but the thing about a pastor is I always tell people I got three shots at them a week so I don't have to get in a hurry when you're a pastor you don't have to get in a hurry I can just kind of take my time and preach and really get it out there to the people so they can comprehend it and uh it's just been a blessing what L God's done in my life I never pictured myself as a pastor like I say I ran from it my entire life but now that I finally actually accepted the call that God gave me the last four years it's been a blessing it's been a blessing to the church I've seen people really move up and be blessed by it and that like I say it just Thrills my heart it really does and and to see what God's doing in this end time and and for me to be just a small part of it it's just a it's a blessing so as I've said I believe I understand Grace because I am misg Grace you know what I'm saying I really am I have that winning band of Grace I'm that elected lady and I appreciate that so you've been a good audience I hope I didn't confuse anybody with this morning I didn't want to come across as a mad scientist cuz some people probably would think I was and that's not what I wanted to do but I just wanted to show you how God announces it in the heavens and then he does it on Earth is what he does God said it that way in Genesis and he's proved it to us again in this end time that he's still the same yesterday today and forever right and I've told the church the most most anointed preaching that I could do is when I preach current conditions because see he's he's a Jesus of today and if I can't if I preach you a historical God of 2,000 years ago then I feel like as a minister I haven't done my job I've got to bring him present I've got to bring him right here the people is what we have to do so brother brandom even preached modern events made clear by prophecy so your Prophet brought Jesus Christ on the scene is what he did and your should bring Jesus Christ real in this congregation is that right so that's what the true Ministry I believe in this hour will do they'll bring Jesus into the congregation is what they'll do and we know that's the son of man so that's it's just a wonderful subject the son of man I enjoy preaching on it and I think it's a very if you preach on the son of man I promise you be a very anointed service that you preach it really is so God bless you and I appreciate you for having me and brother Samuel and uh you know I I tell the church anymore after I Minister I can't hardly let them go because there's such an anointing that comes down in the congregation it's such a presence of God there that you really don't want to leave it and there's going to come a time where we won't have to leave each other we're going to spend we're just going to spend eternity with one another and it's going to be an awesome awesome time it really is so I want to say thank you uh from the depths of my heart the way you you always treat me well here uh it's just a it's just a great place to be and I think you're a blessed people by having brother Samuel is your pastor and when I see the people I mean you know brother R said you want to understand a minister look at his wife I don't think he was necessarily talking about sister Peggy when he said that but you're good okay I'm not to sister Peggy man smart guy right I do love sister Peggy she's a bit a blessing to me just like brother Samuel but you're he's your husband spiritually speaking of the congregation so when I look out there and I look at you you're the results or you're the fruit of this man's ministri what you are so I know he I know he's a very fine Minister cuz why I can look at the congregation and I can see your living Epistles written R of all men so Lord bless you and I appreciate each and every one of you so I want to go and I want to title this to this tonight if I would it's a little different maybe you think or whatever but I want to call it signs or plagues signs plural or plagues if you remember this morning I preached on the sign of his coming right but we have signs all around us do you know that if you go read the messages in 1964 brother Brandon is almost totally talking about signs did you know that sign after sign after sign is what he's talking to us about so that's what I want to talk about it's either signs or plagues yeah one of the others just like I said in the six seal it's either redemption or judgment does everybody understand that so I just want to read some scriptures okay let's go to Exodus 4 and9 Exodus 4:9 this is God talking to Moses okay and it shall come to pass if they will not believe also these two signs neither hearken unto thy voice that thou shalt take of the water of the river and that thou shalt take of the water of the river and pour it upon the dry land and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land now I'm going to go to Exodus 4:17 okay I'm going to bounce around a bit I apologize for that but it'd be just way a lot of scripture reading if I didn't Exodus 4 and thou shalt take this rod in thine hand wherewith Thou shalt do signs right yeah plural right Exodus 4:30 and Aaron spake all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses and did the signs in the sight of the people right right okay now in Exodus 9:13 and the Lord said unto Moses now the The Exodus 49 417 430 he was dealing with the children of Israel so he show the children of Israel he was showing them signs does everybody agree with that right it was signs that he was showing to the children of Israel now we're going to talk to where he's talking to pharaoh and the Lord said unto Moses rise up early in the morning and stand before pharaoh and say unto him thus sayith the Lord God of the Hebrews let my people go and that they may serve me for I will at this time send all my plagues so it's not signs to the Egyptians it's plagues does everybody understand that send all my plagues upon thine heart and upon thy servants and upon thy people and that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the Earth amen okay I want to read another scripture here this may not sound like it's the same but I'll try to bring it together can I do that Hebrews 12:6 for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth right and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth you know brother random a lot of times in the message says if you when you become a a Christian that God tries you sure you know God has every right to try you as a son or daughter of God the scripture says don't you never try God did you know that see you don't try God if God says it it'll be just like God says so don't you try him but God has a right to try you and why he tries you he's going to see if you're going to keep his word right that's what the trials are for that's why God tries you to see if your faith is going to hold is that right you I don't care who you are if you're a Christian here and you are you're all are a Time tested Memorial is what you are you are a - tested church is what you are is that right and God will send things your way to test you and to prove you just like he did with job he didn't do that to curse job is that right job's wife said why don't you just curse job and just die but he couldn't do it right because job knew that he was a Son of God and he was being tried of God and he kept his facei is that right that's what we're supposed to do too let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we thank you for the reading of your word we pray that you'll Quicken it to us Lord help me oh Father to get myself out of the way and may that Mighty Angel come and minister to the hearts of this people Lord I pray that truly Lord that they'll open their heart like I said you're not looking for a red carpet you're looking for an open heart if they want to do something for you they need to open their hearts oh father and I pray they will Lord and may you speak to them this morning in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen you may be seated just to give you the definition here a plague is an Affliction or Calamity sudden destruction an epidemic or evil did you know that's what a a plague is an Affliction or clamity sudden destruction epidemic or evil is what it is okay and a sign a sign is a signal and for example like when you guys were coming to church today there were signs all up down the road right yeah well you you think man just hatched that up on their own no God's the same way what's he going to do we're on a journey home and God's going to put constant signs up along the way to to Signal you to let you know where you're at in a journey if there's a big turn coming right God's going to allow us to make that turn he's got to put a sign there it goes like that I don't know about you but when I see when I'm going down the road and I see that sign that's got little like that I slow down yeah amen is that right so God absolutely gives you Signs Now I told you this morning about the sign of his coming there was one sign that was given for his coming is that right but for the journey that we're on you got to understand there's many signs that God places out you there to get you where you'll get home safely is that right now do you know in a in in the natural the average uh mishaps or the average wrecks that happen or within 5 miles of your home exactly does everybody know that amen do you does everybody notice here lately how many preachers are falling in the message of the hour how many I mean you you hear a preach and it just it baffles your mind doesn't it well go back to what I said it's it's when you see these things happening it's a sign it's letting you know we're getting close to home is what it is okay so when you see people have set in a church for 30 and 40 years and you never thought they would ever fall out of church and you see them falling out what is it it's a sign that we're at the very end of the journey is everybody okay with that but the only way you can fall is if you just disregard the signs that God has given in this end time is that right remember the Scripture it says the blind will lead the blind they'll both fall in the ditch well what happens if you don't pay attention to the signs that are out there on the highway if it says 45 and you're doing 70 right odds are you're going to end up in the ditch is that right well it's the same way with the message of the hour God has G us signs and we're supposed to absolutely pay attention to those signs that's right is that right we're not an ignorant people at all we know what's going on when you look out there in the world and things this shouldn't baffle you none of these things should ba just like the the the earthquake that happened at Tokyo you know I told the church I said I said go read it under the six seal he said there would be earthquakes that would take every island out of its place do you know Tokyo is 13 ft closer to California now what is it it's just a little preview a little sign for you to tell you where you're at in your journey we're at the end of the end now and that's what I tell our church and I'm not guessing when I say that I see the signs that have been given to us and I understand we're at the very end of this thing so if you're out there playing around and goofing off and thinking oh one day you're going to get yourself right with god brother vom said there's going to be a lot of people that God's going to say it's too late you clowned around and when your Calamity comes I'm not going to hear you because you didn't regard me I'm not going to regard you when your Calamity comes and there's a big Calamity coming I see the signs of it don't you I mean you I could preach on you know brother I'm serious go look at what he preached on in 1964 signs is what he preached on I mean just over and over he was showing it that's the grace of God to preach us signs to show us where we're at in our journey and God hadn't stopped showing signs with brother Ram like I said the most anointed preaching I can do is current events things that are going on right now do you know brother brandom tyed Earth you know earthquakes is a plague that's right do you know an earthquake is a plague do you know after we dawned into the New Age of Aquarius what started happening earthquakes lots of earthquakes choosing of a bride brother R said Los Angeles capernium o capernium consolation of angels City of Angels the wrath of God is beling under you right now is that right what is it it was signs that were given but a for us it's a sign for them it's a flag is everybody understand that remember when they came to Elijah I think it maybe Ahab even I can't remember who he said you're plag in Israel right he said no you're plagued Israel right but I want to tell you something do you know a prophet is either a sign or a plague depends on which side if you accept him he's a sign if you don't accept him I guarantee he'll be a plague to you is that right do you know brother B typed an earthquake as a prophet you know a prophet's supposed to take you out of your place yeah come on is it right we get set in the church VI that's my seat right there you know so you know what every time Israel got in the place where they were just set they weren't going to move God sent a prophet on the seed you know what that do he a qu he qued them man he said you're the one troubling Israel he said no you're the one troubling Israel is that right so God when he sent a prophet it was an absolute earthquake to that generation it was a plague it took them out of their place you understand because why and I tell people our church we're Leo to sins fat dumb and happy right I don't know that's ok bonics I don't know how else I don't know how you say in Georgia but that's the way I say in Oklahoma to look at me I said I'm just fat dumb and happy we're L to sins right but God's got to bring something to you that'll shake you out of your place to where you'll realize where we're at and these things are happen like Japan all it is is just a sign for you to understand where we're at on our journey is what it is and you need to get yourself ready you need to quit playing around in this late hour this is not the time that you brother R and the seals I I it just amazed me how simple it really is he preached God in Simplicity before he preach the seal on the first page before you open the seal he said well God you know the reason God's given us these seals is to get where we'll get closer to God Amen to where we'll be fit yeah is that what he said so we'll be fit for the Rapture now that sounds real complicated don't it and we understand those seals were great Mysteries and Revelation and Thunders underneath which is the voice of God we understand that underneath the seals but the real purpose was was to give get you ready to get out of here is that what the seals were all about but yet we try to we try to get you know we got people now they know all the revelations and they live none of it it just I'm going be it sickens me right I mean it really it sickens me you you got all the mysteries of I'm like Paul you're nothing but a tinkling symbol to me that's all you are that's all you are you can have all the Mysteries and you do none of it you live none of it you can you know I was this is no lie I walked into a quick trip one day back home and there was a guy used to attend our church was standing there and he had a pair of cargo shorts on right here and so I'm paying you know I'm going in to pay for my gas I walk up there and you know and he know he knows me so I'm walking up there and I look at him he looks at me he walks up to you said you know I've been reading in the third seal yesterday I didn't say a word to him you know what I did I just dropped my looked at his pants yeah I thought big sister Society you what brother Brandon said BSS big sister Society you go around wearing shorts right and I didn't man I thought here's a guy he wants to he wants me to listen to him about explaining the third seal and he's standing there in a pair of shorts and I just I didn't say a word I honestly I did not I never commented to the guy I paid for my I just stood there and I just dropped my eyes right down his knees I thought you got to be kidding me you think I want to listen to your version of the third seal you got to be kidding me but that's what you got going on around the message hour they want to quote to quotes you said that one time I like that you know that has haunted me ever since you said that she told me that she said what we got around the message hour is a bunch of guys that can quote the quotes yeah she's right that's the reason it haunts me cuz I don't want to like I said I don't want to be Jehovah Witness I just don't want to be a quote quoter you know what they are readers quote quoters see I don't want to be a Jehovah Witness to the message I want to preach a message I want God to inspire me I want the Holy Ghost to come upon me preach a message of inspiration where the people will come up and start doing this message is that right that's what we want don't we so what I want to talk about is it's either a sign to you or it's a plague to you right one or the other that's what it is to you it's a sign or it's a plague is that right amen and like I say a prophet brother brandom what did he do he shook that denominational system down absolutely did you know he did that he shook that to Pieces didn't he you think they didn't hate him oh they hated him I bet when they seen him coming they said oh there's the one that troubles our the Lutheran there's the one that troubles this one there's the guy that's the problem right there why he was an earthquake and he absolutely man he just shook that thing down is what he did is that right so what what it was a plague to him but to me it was a sign it wasn't a plague it was a signal to me is that right and what is a sign signal do it it's it's something it's a message that's sent and a message that's received right so for it to be a sign it's got to be something not only that's sent to you it's receiv received you could go out here and you see the squiggle on the sign you keep going 70 M hour you didn't receive it right and the results going to be the same so you can see the sign but if you don't accept the sign and do what the sign says which really what it's telling you slow down really so that's what we're supposed to do you can see this message all you want you can say I'm a message believer all you want and you're going to end up in the ditch cuz if you don't do what that says on that sign you're going to end up in the ditch is that right right okay so I I told the church now let's let's go over to plagues a little bit and I thought well you know what is a plague well a plague is Affliction what does an Affliction bring forth death the whole purpose of a plague is to afflict you after the Affliction it brings you to death is that right that's what like the black plague that happened back in the Dark Ages is that right what is it it's an Affliction that hits you and it takes you to your death is that right and I thought to myself when I was doing on the plagues I thought well what was the first plague that ever struck the Earth and I thought about it one day I I said you know what the first plague was a liyon preacher that's why I'm not high on preachers if you ever if you ever noticed the first plague that ever struck the Earth was a lying preacher right come on was it did he afflict Eve's mind that's right isn't a plague an Affliction right the thing was he a plague that's good he was a plague Satan right there was a plague to Eve is what he was what did he do he started afflicting her mind if if the she what did the plague bring forth for her death right right man is that right if she wouldn't have accepted what he said it wouldn't have brought forth death but we understand the first first plague that ever the first plague that Satan ever tried to bring the Earth was a lying preacher right he hadn't stopped has he no he still used that plan pretty good don't he you know brother BR seal said a seducing spirit is a preacher right sure you know what he said D yeah that's why I say I'm not too high on preachers I'm a preacher but I ain't too high on them you know brother brandom said there wouldn't be many preachers make it yes that's right I told the church I said I'm I am crazy I always wondered I was marginal you know what I mean but I said when I decided to Pastor a church Church brother R I'm staring a quote in the face that says there's not many preachers going to make it and I'm pastoring I go boy you need to wake up you know what I mean and I thought well Lord you called me to this so Here I Am Lord right you just March out it's what you do so the first plague that ever struck the Earth was a lion preacher well that's something think about isn't it and like I say what do you got out here now lion preachers everywhere you know it just amazes me in this age we're in where the I mean I tell the people you go out to Walmart and see these women stri strip down you know who stripped them down preachers preachers is who stri those women down if those preachers had what they supposed to have the Baptist the Presbyterian all of them that say sister you shouldn't wear those things is that right so what is it it's a PL those women that are stripped down are plagues to you men right abely right do they afflict your mind come on brothers let's get real here I'm a preacher but I'm still a red blooded American male is that right you see a woman's half dressed and you got to do some praying son is that right what is it it's a plague that comes down that's what it is see people think oh I'm the bride I'm the bride I don't get to see any of the plagues you better go read Revelation again there's a certain amount of her plagues that's going to strike her but there were plagues right there in the Garden of Eden right in God's Garden Satan come down and started all producing plagues does everybody understand that you think he's any different in this ER with this is Satan's eating you talk about plagues you can look the right hand their left hand there is nothing but plagues out there you understand what I'm saying that's right does everybody agree with that now of the children of Israel they signs right when I see a woman half dressed out there I go to where it says as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming in the son of man is that right so when I see things like they were marrying given in marriage right is that right now they brother said they just flat work getting married you know what I'm can I say it like we say live in everywhere you go I think they said in Oklahoma 70% livein now 70% they don't bother to go get a marriage license now is that right well what as it was in the days of Noah it said in the days of Noah they were they were they were given wives right didn't say a wife it said wives plural does everybody understand that so go read it in Genesis six it says they were GI taken and given wi is that way it is marriage and divorce marriage and divorce and half of them don't like say it's not a marriage and a divorce where we're at it's just live in you go you know if you don't like her out she goes and another one comes in I mean that is absolutely as it was in the days of Noah what is that it's plagues that striking the Earth it's plagues I told somebody the other day I said you know brother brandom our prophet he had a cross a little 2-in cross right in his car hanging on the mirror because of the women in that day now I don't know about you but I was around in ' 62 and ' 63 I didn't see too many women wearing shorts back then they were women were still awfully decent come on you guys were in the 60s some of you here is that right he had a 2 by two I said if brother Brennon was here now he'd have a twoot by twoot cross in his car and I'm not being funny but come on is it the truth come on you guys are here you you know you women are subjected to the same thing big sister Society right these men all stripped off and everything course a real woman sister would make her puke she's seen in these come on you know that's what brother ROM said right so you understand but these things that are striking her are plagues but to us it's signs we see the signs now and we understand we're at the end does everybody understand that so all these things you see out here are nothing more than signs or plagues depending on which side of the Cross you're on is that right exactly so it's it's a signal to you God is trying to Signal you the flashing red light of his coming God is trying to get this church ready for a Rapture is what he is he's trying to get you away from the world and the things of the world and all these things that are plaguing people is that right even in in Daniel 70 we or Daniel you know he said that in the end time they'd be running to and fro amen do you know brother random said that everybody was they were neurotics do you know one day I was going to preach on neurotics at the church so I went to a psychological Journal I looked up neurotics they said that is no longer a valid analysis and you know why cuz everybody's a neurotic brother Ram said back then they're one degree away from Insanity so if you said neuro you know what neurotic is running to and fro that's what he said in Daniel's day hurry up and wait how many of us why why are we in such a hurry you and this church come on don't you get in a hurry and you sit there at the end of the day you say why am I in a hurry because you're getting caught up in the hour in the day in these these it's a plague that struck the Earth you understand it's like I told Brother Joseph computers I started computers 34 years ago we dropped 80 column Cards into a hopper you think that wasn't fast no you'd take 4,000 of them you sit there and drop it in and watch them track another it took I remember I worked for an insurance it took us 3 days to run the stocks and bonds out to print the checks it don't take them nearly that long now because the computers have sped up so fast but when you're an IT guy like me when something breaks they want you to have it fixed 2 minutes later they can't wait does everybody understand why running to and fro everything the computer the T I read an article on the TV one time where these kids that watch these video games you remember in the old days when the preacher uh the old circuit Rider preacher he would come into a town and he would preach at a church and they'd have a service all day long did you know that's way the so circuit writers did then technology come in then they got the radio preachers well it was an hour long then they got the TV preachers it's 30 minutes long then these kids got into videos and everything and I I I really read this they said now you know how long it take how long for a preacher you got this many seconds long to get people's attention or they just just ignore you you know how many seconds they said it was seven if you don't get the attention of the people in 7 Seconds you'll lose them did you know that you ever look at these and then don't look at them but these movies that come out they say every 8 seconds this the thing's flipping you're a computer guy I don't know if you understand but you know the refresh cycle on a PC how fast they are and these scenes like they had the one the what was it the uh Armageddon they said they change the scene so fast every 8 seconds and they somebody asked them why did you do that cuz the you lose them if you don't so they're starting to verify that you understand what is that it's a curse is what it is it's a plague that struck the Earth that it that Daniel prophesied about that would happen in the end time they'd be running to and fro is that right brother brand said a guy would get in the car remember brother brand said he's going down the road and this guy around went around pulled into his parking lot he said an hour while his wife fixed lunch for him supper what was it it's Daniel what he trying to tell you Daniel's being fulfilled people are running to and fro they're in a hurry and they don't know why they're in a hurry I told my church why don't you slow down we're too big a hurry to read our Bibles yeah is that right come on help me if I'm wrong somebody help me say h you're too big a hurry to read your Bibles you're too big a hurry to pray you're too big a hurry to pick up a message book that's right is that right what is that you're fulfilling what Daniel said where they'll be running to and fro is that right so what you need to do message Believers you need to realize this is a sign to you that you need to slow your life down you need to get yourself by the bootstraps like brother brandom said and say why am I doing what I'm doing yeah half the time when I look at myself I say why am I doing this yeah is there any real value in me hurrying up and waiting all the time right no so what we need to do as a congregation we need to start slowing down we need to start doing what we need it was a sign that was given to us by Daniel does everybody understand that what we need to do is slow down and start reading our Bibles is that right okay so you understand these things that we're seeing going on out there the earthquakes it's a signed to us and they getting you know I preach on when that happened you know the earthquakes and I had the statistics I don't have them with me now but you know that last year the number of earthquakes that were hard earthquakes had quadrupled does everybody know that do you know in a natural birth the pain start to get harder at the end when you're going to birth the child you sisters come on help me here I mean I ain't have no kids so say Amen please right so you understand when the births coming it when you're close to it get closer together and harder is that right well guess what this earthquake that happened over there is a 9.1 it's the fifth largest one and you know what the one in Indonesia a little while back it was a big one right what's happening God is showing you by this sign that the Earth is fixing to be birthed a new is that right now that's what brother renom taught us in birth pains is that right so it's a sign to us when we see these earthquakes of the magnitude and the frequency that they are it's proed to us there's going to be a new Earth is that right well guess what we're going to be out of here long before that happens is that right we're not going to see tribulation folks does everybody understand that but I'm going to tell you you're going to get some plagues sure is that right in the church ages and you T it at our church so I know they've heard it cuz you taught it at ours I know you taught it here every time a trumpet sounded a War Began what fell a plague fell is that right every Church age when that messenger said trumpet sounded it declared a war and a plague fell is that all right so the people say well I'm not going to see the plagues well yeah you are you certainly are going to see some plagues if you don't see them now there's something wrong with your experience you ought to look around this and if you don't sigh and cry against the Abominations done in the land it's you don't have the mark that the the writer gave them is that right so we ought to understand these things we ought to see the signs that are going on around and what is a sign it's a signal to you it's trying to get you to direct yourself home and quit being this lacad isical people that we become these leot to sins that are lazy is that right we need to pull our up and get get to reading the message of the hour can I tell you that like I say the people expect the preacher to do all of it and you need to do it you understand you need to be praying for this man every day I mean these are things that we need to be doing as a congregation brother brand said what's holding to Rapture up the bride what is holding us up the Readiness of the Bride we're the ones holding the Rapture up we need to look around at the signs that God's put before us and realize we're at the end of the end now so we need to get our lives in order we need to start shaking ourselves seeing if you absolutely are truly abiding in the message of the hour see if you're under the messenger is that right amen so these plagues these plagues have been Fallen right we've been falling for a long time and we haven't recognized that they're falling right and like I said it fell on Eve in the Garden of Eden that's hard to imagine isn't it but she was afflicted there God Satan had come and Afflicted her mind and that plague hasn't stopped since then you I mean I don't care who you are a preacher I don't care how holy you think you are the devil's going to afflict your mind he's going to tell you well you don't have it isn't that what he likes to do right and then you go out there and you know I'm a human I got eyes and and you go out there and you look to the right man by the way was you look to the right there's a blond-headed woman you go oh you look to the left there's a brunette woman it's like oh my gosh it's a plague you understand what I'm saying there's plagues out there and scripture says you're supposed to cast down every imagination that exalts itself against God but don't get thinking you're so holy and Pious that these things don't touch you look I teach our church you know there was light and Goan the plagues fell on Egypt does everybody agree with that so you're going to say well they fell Egypt they didn't fall for him in Goan let me type it for you gan's in you yeah the light was in Goan the inside of the inside the plague don't fall there on me this is Egypt right here this is bondage to me there's plagues that fall on this don't kid yourself don't think you're not exempt from those things cuz I'm going to tell you you are so you think well look poor pitiful me look what's falling on me God chastens and tries his children is does everybody agree with with that every son every daughter that comes to God he's got a right to chasen you to try you to prove you right God didn't step back and say Satan you get away from me could have he done it sure sure he could have done it right but what did he do he let him try he let him prove God knew what they would do but you think God you know just like joob if you considered my servant Jo that's right that's pretty good isn't it right perfect man have you considered him you got a hedge around him man I can't even touch him so I'll take the Hedge off for me is that right right did the plagues fall on him was he still a Son of God so see brother ROM even taught us in the message just because you're going you're driving a Mercedes and you got a big house times are good don't mean you got it is that right and if you're poorly you may live in a little Shack down on wherever down on the river that don't mean you ain't got it is that right so understand so there's plagues that are falling right now can I tell you that plagues plagues afflictions where Satan's trying to constantly afflict you he's afflicting you out here but inside of here he can't get there because I've been sealed with the Holy Ghost there's light in Goan is everybody that's where the children of Israel resided in Goan that's where I live down in Goan amen that I don't live in out there you live out there it's CU you are out there that's right is that right so one or the other you got signs or you got plagues one or the other one or the other right and you're not exempt from the plagues I hope you understand that exactly I mean there's some people thinking a message that well I'm a message believer like you ain't going to get no Affliction I got news for you brother man said did he say this don't pack for a picnic right pack for a battle right I don't know about you but the battle's Affliction so the devil's coming after you is that right and I taught the church this you know you look all through the scripture where Israel was afflicted were they the children of Israel were they the chosen of God absolutely they were weren't they but you know I'm I'm going to show you a Philistine does anybody know what the def anybody ever looked up the definition of philistine you know what it is immigrants laugh but that's what it is go click on it Philistines is immigrants you know what an immigrant is it has no loyal allegiance to the land they're in right right exactly they have no loyal allegiance to the land they're in do you know what the Phil look at the characteristics of the Philistines with Israel okay Shamar every time this crop came up who come marching down to take it from him those immigrants right I I know I'm get arrested after you got this on video Don't you so I don't do that at our church but anyway that's okay so you understand the whole point of the Philistines was to what Israel got a blessing the Philistines came right there to take it away show me every time Israel got a a blessing the Philistines were on their front door trying to get it back you know what this blessing that you're getting today which I hope you're getting blessed the Philistines are going to be right there soon as you walk out that back door to take it from you does everybody understand that with Shamar it was that way every one of the characters in The Bible if if if you got a blessing if Israel was blessed the Philistines were right there at their door to take it right that's an Affliction they Afflicted Israel does everybody understand it's a plue what happens you'll come you'll hear me Minister you'll hear Brother Samuel Minister and you'll think what he just said go he just preached God s a prophet that's all he preached they go out the back door do you know what shamgar picked up in Ox go did that look very significant to kill 300 Philistines would have you picked up an oxco to kill 300 Philistines if you were Samson would you picked up the Jawbone of an ass to kill a thousand amen but he picked up what he had right does everybody understand what I'm saying right so you come to church whatever the pastor whatever you God gave you is that right that's the way we work as pastors right I told him pastors can't keep secrets right no that's right brother you know where your Prophet said he couldn't keep a secret thank God yeah right I read one day he said you he said you know I can't keep a secret I thought man am I happy I am happy because if God told him something he gave it out right that's what that's what a pastor can keep a secret right I hope you can not talking about if you come to him about some crazy thing in your life you know what I mean God reveals something to us we got we can't wait to get out and oh man I can't wait I can't wait to get a church give that you know and he gives it out and you may say I don't know if I understood that or not I don't know well you know what tomorrow promise me or I'll promise you the Philistines are going to be at your door to take whatever it is he gave you and it may not seem like much can I say that after you've been in the message 30 40 years it may not have seemed like much but when that Philistine comes there try to take something away from you whatever it is whatever's right there that you can grab right amen you grab it and you kill a Philistine with it and then you know what the guy that's afflicting you he ain't get nothing right so you may not you may think sometimes you come to a a service and it was insignificant but I'm going to tell you it'll kill an Affliction the next day some Philistines going to be at your door he's going to try and take the blessing this man gave you you take that blessing no matter how insignificant you think it is a Jawbone of an act can you imagine that now how can you yeah how can you explain that that thing been rotten out in the desert I I mean brother BR said the first time he hit one of those 2in helmets they brass helmets they had on them it should have exploded that Jawbone right he killed a thousand of them with it so don't it don't matter what you think you take what the man gives you is that right and then you go out the back door and I promise you a Philistine is going to come to you oh yeah that Philistine that plague that Affliction is going to come to you just like that and when it does you take whatever it is that you got and you kill it glory amen are you okay with that so these all these different things that you seen Israel were afflicted by these were plagues all through their their Journey Israelite right and God said go kill them take care of it right God sent him a prophet prophet's a sign right he's a sign if they listen you know I I preached a message here while back Church you know in Samuel's day David right David or in the book of s David wanted to go get the ark where is he going to put right brother if you go look at trying to do God one of the things was you got to have it's got the place got it's got to be placed right David wanted to get the ark back he had no place to put it what was he doing why was he coming and bringing the ark back and he didn't have a temporal to put it in did he he had nowhere to put the thing it cost him man life because why he got ahead of God is that right see that's what we do sometimes we're try we get ahead of God you got to be sure you're placing this thing right you understand that's what David did he was trying to do good god of service but he didn't do it with his will is that right so be careful folks you may you'll get ahead of God is that right so you better check it out and make sure you're in the perfect will of God okay so we understand the Philistines were nothing more than Affliction a plague to the children of Israel every blessing they ever got here were the Philistines do you know the Philistines I don't know if you studied out the Philistines lived on five mountains did you know that in Israel you ever looked at it in Israel the Philistines lived in 1 2 3 4 5 when children of Israel came in when they took the land they were supposed to kill all the inhabitants did they exactly they didn't do it did they when they came in they were supposed to kill all the inhabitants you know what happened the Philistines were the ones that ran out in the mountains and they got lazy just like some of us message Believers come on right see you're going going to get lazy you ain't going to crawl up in the you ain't going to do any work you mean I got to pray and read my Bible every day you kidding me right no no climb a mountain kill a Philistine you understand what I mean so they got lazy they they got down there and life was good hey the corn was growing God gave them the corn they just to go pick the corn they didn't have to do anything did they brother way so what did they do God said kill them all they didn't kill the Philistines those immigrants those ones that were there and had no Allegiance at all to God is that right right if they' have killed in things they wouldn't have had a problem with them so he went on five mountains you know what the five mountains were touch feel taste yeah here you understand that's the Philistines that's the one who afflict you you understand what I'm saying is that what he does so see that's what the devil does those are the Avenues that you see like I say you go out here and there's a woman I mean it's unbelievable anymore I mean you know I I you know we us men we talk you women know that you women you talk right sometimes you look I say did I really see that it's like e no I mean we're human that's what I'm saying a lot of people in the message are they don't think they're human anymore I guess they think they're those little clouds floating around in the air they can't feel touch here taste here right but no those were the Philistines they left up in the mountains am they left them there you understand and you know what we still got them here and they afflict you is what they do and they'll come down and try to take everything you get from this service is what they're going to do they'll say well I don't you know you'll think you I don't know but and that's what it'll do right well I'm not feeling good well what's your feelings got to do with it get yourself to church you know what I mean cast down those things get those Philistines are going to take everything you let them have oh yeah but Shamar killed finally he said you know what I've had enough and he looks around all he had was an ox go and he went out there and kill 300 of them you know he become a judge in is after that because why he resisted the Philistines you want to get anywhere in the message start killing some Philistines they're immigrants they don't even belong there didn't brother Rand say the devil was a squatter what was he saying he was a Philistine he has no right to be here does everybody understand that so all these different peoples were out there afflicting Israel now I'm going to tell you about another one can I tell you this amen amorites have you ever looked up the characteristic of an Amorite what they were you know what an Amorite you look in the days of of uh Abraham you remember the the the Nations that that got together and they went out there and they conquered Sodom and gomorah and they took them captive you know that was amorites go look it up that was amorites so one of the characteristic of Amite amorites were they like to organize there were five kings that were under one king you understand what I'm saying the amorites there's a characteristic that you might have missed but the amorites go look at it they would be several Kings but they put one king over them amorites right amorites and I'm going to come back to that in a minute to show you something that's happened in our hour amorites you know what another characteristic of an Amorite they they would eat anything you put in front of them yeah that might not sound from uh significant but it is to me is that about the way it is in around the message they are you can throw any old doct in front of somebody they'll lay it up it shows they an Amorite you understand Israel was cursed by those amorites those amorites constantly plag them do you understand what I'm saying but what you're supposed to do you're supposed to get rid of those things kill every one of them like I said you you didn't come to a picnic you came to a battle is that right that's right and you know you think about it and it's we always look at things out there it's right here amongst us you know and like I said you look in the message I challenge anybody you show me where it says message Church you show me where it says message Church brother random wasn't trying to build a church brother random was trying to get us out of here brother ROM was trying to get us to the son of man if we get people the son of man we don't get them to some church then they're going to take a Rapture is what they're going to do you get them to some church they're going to sit there in the Pew and die they're going to be like it little eaglit you on that little fur you know they don't want go old Jehovah starts pulling the hair out the fur and they start hitting the Thorns ow ow ow pretty soon they're going to fly is that right but that's what a lot of people around the me we're a m we're a messy Church well see they're making it real cozy for you all they're doing if you want the truth or command and they're just creating another denomination right the spirit of it right we're not we're not creating a church we're creating a bride somebody to rise up and get out of here right so the amorites they' eat any old thing you gave them did you know that anything anything another point you can come and look at the amorites remember Joshua when he was when he was in the Battle and he knew that if if the sun went down that they would regroup and then it would come back and kill some of the Israelites right you know those were amorites he was fighting do you know that God absolutely Joshua Jehovah savior stopped the Sun and the Moon and said time shall be no more does everybody get what I'm do with this time shall be no more what happened in our time when the mighty Angel come down what did he say time shall be no more did you ever understand why he did that we got some amorites to kill right we got some amorites to kill these people that'll eat any old thing you throw down in front of them we're going to kill that thing any Doctrine any saying teaching or doctrine that rises up in this message we're going to kill it is that what we're supposed to do why did he say that why did he hold the Sun so we could kill all the amorites what were amorites they like to get they were organizations and people that like to eat anything you threw in front of them does that Mak sense right so that's the whole purpose is what was said in Revelation time shall be no more is everybody got it right why it's for us God stopped that for us so that we can kill it all we're going to kill every do right you've been fighting a long time you understand we're going to kill every Doctrine right and we ain't going to we are the people we don't eat just just anything you throw down in front of us if we can't read it we can't see the scripture in the tapes if everything don't lock up don't blend together we're not going to eat it I'm not an Amorite or an Amorite I'm Jewish and I eat kosher food amen is that right I eat fresh kill I'm an eagle when he drops it down to me I eat it but I check it out by the word brother when that angel of the Lord come to me he said he gave me this scripture this scripture this and many more he said if that angel come to me and gave me something and I couldn't find an in the word I wouldn't accept it why brother BR was an Amorite does everybody understand that we're not an Amorite either we're not going to eat anything that some old preacher throws down in front of us we're going to make sure it's kosher is that right there's the significance of that so the amorites plag the people yeah is that right but see to me it's a sign it's not a plague to me you understand it plagues this but down on the inside of the inside God's taking care of me God has given me a sword he didn't just give brother brand that sword did you understand that amen exactly brother brand ain't the one who's got the king sword I got the king sword is that right it's it's a revealing it's the word that's what I've got and I'm going to go forth and I'm going to slaughter every Philistine every Amorite anything that tries to bring a plague on me I'm going to kill it you understand what I'm saying so it's a it's a it's a sign or it's a plague one of the other which is it you know and you like I say people in the message there and I I tell my church people think they're just going to sit there and they're just going to hear good preaching and they're not a part of it that all it is is just coming and saying and hearing of word preacher preach man if that was all of it it'd be that'd be easy wouldn't it well this is it ain't going to be that easy people there's some you got to go out and do something you got to go out and kill some of these things or trying to come upon you you understand and what's trying to come upon you plagues is what they are y and you know what if you'll resist the devil scripture says he'll flee from you amen amen is that right and but you look you know and brother brandom talked about and I looked through you know when I did the message this morning about a sign I thought it very unique when it talks about the coming of the Lord it says one sign that's it cuz you know if there were several signs to prove his coming that would be confusing wouldn't it so God didn't do it that way he said I'm going to give you there's the sign of the son of man one sign that's going to come to show you the com but you know what to show you the end of the world to show you the end of the world there's going to be signs does everybody understand where I'm going with that to show you where at the end of the world there's going to be signs as it was in the days of knowing so shall it be in the coming of the son of man so God has showed you we're at the end of the world is everybody it's not just the coming that now we're looking at we're looking at the signs plural which are telling us we're at the end of the road right that's why when I get up and preach I say we're at the end of the end now I'm not guessing when I say that I have seen I've read 1964 the messages and I will assure assure you the signs of the end time are here we're at the end for the Gentile kingdom does everybody understand that God's fixing to go to the Jews and there not be another Gentile saved once he goes to the Jews so I don't know what the young people are thinking you better get in now cuz when this Rapture takes place brother R said there would not be another Gentile Saint done is that right so this is not a clown around time where we're at you know I told people when I was a young man I sent a message I was 13 how old are you son 16 well I was 13 now 16 is a bad age I'm going to give you some advice now can I I know how 16 is buddy it's rough okay at 13 I was sitting in a message Church second row no first row right over here okay I had my Bible I had my message books I looked like the message of the hour and then one day a plague hit me yeah you know what it was car keys car keys car keys that's right and you know my mom handed me the car keys and buddy I never turned around took me and you know I was 30 years old before I came back to Missi it took me 14 years to get that car turned around that's right seriously seriously it was a curse to me it wasn't a blessing it was a curse is that right but that's what I want to say that you know there's son when I left back I was in I see when I been that been about 1972 when you were preaching no before that even about 68 I know I had to recalculate took me a while 68 well you know the Revelation the breaking of the son of man hadn't really come yet I'm sorry but it didn't and I tell people in our church cuz they look at me and they say well you dropped out and you come back you're pastoring the church yeah so kids look at that and they say oh man you're going it's happily thereafter no we didn't have the Revelation it wasn't breaking back then the son of man you understand all we had was God sent a prophet there was all sorts of things going on in God sent a prophet does everybody understand what I'm saying it really was so when I got the car keys vroom off I went you know but when I came back what I came back to is the son of man that's the that's what I came back under you children here are under the son of man Ministry what's left for you you go out you go away from this what's going to happen you I don't know I'm not trying to scare you but we're at the end of this thing this is the last sign what is the last sign that was given mezic the word made flesh that was the last sign that was given is that right so there were signs given but that was the last sign that this generation is going to see is the sign of mezic is that right so if you you children here you ain't got no time to clown around you I mean I'm sorry I'm not trying to cheat you out anything trust me I clowned around out there for 14 years and I didn't find any I found one good thing right there and it was God's grace that she came in with me I don't know what the only reason well I w't say that well yeah I will God looked over the gift right I had a gift in my life I didn't even know it I was a knad right but God looked over me and he protected the gift to being a pastor cuz if I have married her and she' have divorced me and I have married something done you understand what I'm saying so God looked after the gift is what he did my wife has come in she believes the same message I do will it always end up that way I don't think so right I'm telling you don't try that don't try God is that what I said God can try you but you better not try God is that right and you know what you know we say well you get on where you get off right when I came into the church I when we came there was a big meeting going on it's just people everywhere and me and my wife come to back door they didn't have a seat open to set but right here on the front row do you know I physically I understand that quote that brother man said you get on where you got off I got off right there and 30 14 years later I come through the back doors of that same church I sit right down there and preacher got up in the pulpit and preached the son of man do you know I I I read before I came to the church there I was going to a charismatic church I told you when they prophesied over me I read one and I knew brother Brandon was a prophet that's one thing I got when I was 13 years old I did get God sent a prophet nobody could ever talk me out of William Brandon being a prophet that was done there you know I was under a son of man I knew he was a prophet absolutely and when I came back before I came I read proving his word brother said the word was made flesh in this day right I said I was praying I said Lord if you're here in the flesh give me the same opportunity you gave the disciples to either accept you or reject you that's all I'm asking for that's simple just let me accept you if you're here let me come face to face with let me accept you or reject you just a little simple prayer I was reading a book never thought about it two weeks later brother Jess's niece ran into me at Kmart I was buying a fishing lure that's when I was in a bass fishing I thought like a fish I mean I mean I was on the lake all the time you know I think brother Danny and brother Wade were too from what I understand but anyway she come up to me and said Claude I don't want to tell you this this woman told me I don't want to tell you this she wasn't even going to brother Jess church because his niece she heard he was having a Revival over there they had some black brothers and sisters vising from South Carolina singing and you know and I told her I said well I like singing so she said yeah oh they're having a big Revival over over there singing and you know he invited me but the Lord told me now is't that odd and you know what I was going with that woman to the church she was going to the charismatic why would she invite me to another church right you think God don't work in strange ways folks he does don't he so she says I don't my I don't want to tell you this but God told me I'm supposed to tell you this I thought well okay but she said the other hand so I told my wife went home and said you know what I'd like to go I'd like to go you know I'd like to go I like good singing you know so I went over there like I said come through the back door right here the preacher was up there and he preached the son of man I wore contacts then I cried them out of my eyes me and a black brother crawled around on the carpet trying to find my contacts at the end of that service I got to see the son of man I got to see the word made flesh does everybody understand that right am it was a sign is what it was there's sign and signs given out there to help you on your journey is is that right and so when you look at things out there it's it's not just a plague it's a sign to you to show where we're at in our journey am that's the point I really wanted to to get to you here this morning okay it's absolutely a sign to show you where you're at and all the signs have run out does everybody understand that you've had to sign a Jonah is that what he said brother random said the Queen of Sheba was a sign do you know Sheba if you look at up is seven you know Sheba is seven means seven the queen of seven that's who I am amen I'm the queen of seven is that right you're well you don't but you know you know you see that where it says s seven s on the slot machines they got that from the Queen of Sheba it always shows a queen on them you ever notice that that's the Queen of Sheba they mimicking is what it is but so you're the Queen of Sheba you're the one who goes across the desert you're the one who's on a journey you're the one wants to hear the wisdom of Solomon is that right we are the ones and it even shows up in this day it was a sign that was given to you brother bam said when he preached the seals or what was the seals no future home 1500 miles they come to hear that message what was it it was a sign of the Queen of Sheba all these things were given to show you that we're at the end of time is what it is right there's not much time left I hope everybody understands that you can take all these signs that we given Noah you know lot was a sign to the sodomites when lot left they should have realized it was time to burn brother BR said Enoch was a sign to Noah you know when Enoch went up brother BR said that was a sign to Noah he needed to get ready that the flood was coming does everybody know he said that so Enoch was a sign so there's signs all around and I think sometimes it's leot Deans we're almost dumb to the signs that around we don't really pay attention to what they are out there what their purpose is but and like I said this morning and I hope this will grind it home to you the purpose is you right amen God don't play games you think God you think God's wasting this time out there in that Jun no it's just signs that are given for you all these things that brother Rand go pick up that cigarette package brother said I ain't picking that up yeah what go pick it up he had a message he wanted to preach it was a sign to brother brand he had to pick it up is that right so you see all these things out here what are they they're signs to us to show us where we're at right so that we might not fall in a ditch is what it is is that right right so these are the thing that's what I wanted to understand is people think oh yeah the plagues are going to be yeah they always look oh yeah yeah oh the pressure when the pressure comes brother R said the pressure is now exactly did you know there's a quote he said the pressure is now amen message people were sitting here like I said this morning fat dumb and happy and we don't realize the very thing we're looking to happen is happening right you need to look at the current events made clear by prophecy is that right brother said modern events it's the same way of saying it modern events made clear by prophecy so right now the things you're looking to happen are happening and you need to catch the sign of it so you won't fall in the ditch is that right that's the whole purpose of all this thing all that you see around here is for you right that's right brother boy he must love me brother everything he you ought to be that like I said you ought to be the happy happy happiest people on the face of the Earth right everything everything you see God's doing it for you he ain't doing for that out there Glory he ain't doing that for them right he's doing it for you right amen all these things it's for you it's to show you where we're at so that you'll be ready you'll not be caught unaware is that right so that's what it plagues and signs right that to the children of Israel they were signs to those Israel or to those Egyptians they were plagues is that right right but see that's the way it is so we got some here yeah right oh yeah sure come on and the devil's going to afflict you as soon as you walk out that door sure he'll afflict your mind he he doesn't you know the devil don't change his tactics either if he did Eve that way and he attacked her mind get ready when you leave here he's going to start chipping away at your mind too amen that's even Paul warned you that did he not 2 Corinthians 11: 2 and 3 as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtility I fear that your minds be corrupted from the Simplicity that was in Christ Jesus is that right exactly no wonder brother brand and preach God in Simplicity you understand cuz it is very simple but it came to a simple people right if if it was hard simple people couldn't get it the common people couldn't receive him gladly if it was let see it's not scripture says a fool need not he therein right right is that right God used to win wink at ignorance he don't wink where we're at right cuz ignorance is to ignore it did you know that you're not going to get away with ignoring message now you set a message Church you hear the TR truth preached by a preacher God's not going to bless you anymore if you ignore what this man says you're in trouble right I'm going to tell you that you're in trouble now we know the last plague that struck the church right was dead is that what he said right that's what we're looking at now and brother man said there's people dying right on the church pew so don't tell me the plagues ain't Fallen that's you'll never convince me there ain't plagues falling where we're at absolutely right is that right amen and you know you know what death really is don't you organization right they'll sit right there and organize right is that right like I told it's what they do they organize you can have a an organizational Spirit each one of you sitting here today and it'll bring death to you is what it will exactly is that right it'll bring death to you is what it will but I told him to church and and I want to say this and I'm going to close in the first church age he came forth to conquer and conquering we know that's nickan Spirit wasn't it right now I'm going to bring it down remember I said that the first plague that ever struck the Earth was a lion preacher is it right let me show you something there's plagues that have struck some of the message churches the guy will ride out he'll have a saying a teaching or a Doctrine is that right yeah then the next thing he's on a white horse he'll ride that for a while he'll jam it down to people's throat because he's there to conquer them I'm the I'm the big dog around here I got the message of the hour you're going to have to listen to me that nickol in spirit it's my way or the highway and that what they do so they have a saying a teaching a Doctrine then what happens after a while they stay on that horse for a while then they get off on the red horse then you know what they'll do they say if you don't believe it like I believe it they'll kill your influence right right they'll ask you to leave the church you know that right they'll take their sword out and they'll kill your influence is what they do and if brother Samuel and me don't believe with what he's doing then they'll kill us too is that the red horse rider and that what he goes around to do then the next horse he gets off on is the black one you don't want the black horse rider what brother Bram said he does he has daughters underneath that so he gets out he kills all the ones that don't agree with him the ones that agree with him that's the daughters now he's got on that black horse rider they form a little click this preacher will preach for that preacher that preacher will preach for this preacher they won't let anybody else in their little click does everybody understand that now they've rode the black horse rider and guess what happens after the black horse rider right all three of those get mixed up and it's dead right and brother man said that's the last plague that's going to strike the Earth does everybody agree with that I want to declare to you that plague is striking now cuz that's what's happened around the message of the hour exactly they go out there they try to get somebody to agree with them if you agree with them okay if you don't they kill you with their sword is that right then they'll go out and get their daughters other churches that'll agree with them right that's right and then what do they do they organize and what does organization bring debt now that's what they do but the individual can do the same thing did you realize that that's right amen you can have a saying a teaching a doctor don't agree with your pastor right then what you'll do you'll kill anybody in the church that don't agree with what you got is that right then you're going to ride around the church trying to figure out if somebody in here will agree with what you got is that right and if they do what's it you usually they'll pull them out the back door they'll start another assembly somewhere oh yeah and then what does it bring forth that right and I'm not saying every time that people leave a congregation it's for that it could be because the guy that's preaching ain't preaching a good doct exactly brother said I told the church the only reason you can leave a church that I can see is if the guy ain't preaching right if the guy's preaching false Doctrine brother R says you get you find you a preacher when you're spiritually fed you remain there the rest of your life but if that guy ain't preaching thus sayeth the Lord if he's not preaching the message ER you better run from that guy I would hit that back door in a hurry then is that right amen so you know you got to watch you got to have a balance in what I said that's why I said it but uh the plague that's HIIT now in the ranks is death right right amen so it's a very serious time as brother say they're dying right here on the church pews so right now you could be dying in this church if you organize and if you decide you got it all figured out is that right you're the big guy around here I'm the boss around here and you try to conquer everybody in the congregation with some say teaching or doctorine you have you better watch out right is that right that's right man so I'm going to close on that one I don't even know what time I got started now probably been too long so it's either plagues or signs is what it is when you go through the message there I just challenge you when you're studying you know I know you probably got a lot of other things to study brother Samuel's preaching but go through and look at where he says signs and you'll find that you'll find it be the Queen of Sheba you'll find it be the sign of Jonah is that right all these things are signs signs signs that God's give you and it's to show you we're at the end time that's his whole purpose in is to show this little bride where we're at cuz how you going to know if you don't know where you're at how you going to know where you're going I mean if you had a map out and you're sitting there at the map you're going I don't know where I'm at well you're in deep trouble if you don't know where you're at you don't know where you're going so that's what these signs were given for us to know where we're at right right right and when you see these plagues it signs to us right that's what it is it's afflictions out there and it's just to show us where we're at folks it's the fulfill all it is is the Fulfillment of scripture y it's these dumb dog preachers that won't preach them they got tingling ears they won't correct it out there and they and literally the preachers Lyon preachers just like it was in the days of Eve lion preachers have stripped them women off out there Lyon preachers is what's brought that plague on the earth out there is that right amen exactly sure that's why I say I'm I'm not always real high on preachers cuz I know what they can get their yourself into you know what I mean but a true preacher it's an awesome thing somebody will bring you thus sayith the Lord yes it's a very awesome thing I know some of you here have talked to me about brother Samuel and how what a great Pastor he is amen that's a good feeling isn't it really to know that people not that they have confidence in me but they have confidence in what I say right that's the important part right I don't even have confidence in me at my church I tell them I'm a man I am a man don't you exalt me whatever you do because what I need is I need your prayer he needs your prayer that's what I said this morning I we need to really pray for the pastors cuz they're in a real battle just like you are right and uh yeah just pray for him if you okay amen I appreciate you too brother Sam appreciate being here appreciate seeing every one of you hopefully it'll give you a different thought to where you'll understand that there's a lot of things out there trying to steal what you got right right cuz you're the you're the ones that got it right so why wouldn't they come try to steal it right amen so there's amorites out there trying to get you there's Philistines out there trying to get you the Hittites are out there trying to get you but you know what there's light and Goan man they can't get me and I'm going to take whatever little thing God gave me through the message of the hour that's it it may seem insignificant to the world but I'm going to pick up my Jawbone and I'm going to kill some Philistines I'm going to pick up my Ox go the next service and I'm going to kill some more Philistines is that right and then I'm going to kill every Amorite every saying teaching or doctrine that don't go with thus sayeth the Lord in this hour right because that's why the sun Stood Still that's why time is no more because we're going to going to kill those doctrines every one of them that rise up brother we're going to kill those doctrines there ain't going to exist the doctor ain't going to be alive out there that we're not going to kill right doesn't that make you happy does me anyway bless you brother that's right God bless you brother appreciate you man amen let's stand what was the life thing to strike the church spiritual
