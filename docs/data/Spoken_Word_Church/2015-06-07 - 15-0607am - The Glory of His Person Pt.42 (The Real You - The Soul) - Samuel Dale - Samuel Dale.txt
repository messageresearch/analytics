in you you Lord we ask you to have your way in our hearts and our lives this day in Jesus name amen remember also the kids the ones who went to the mon uh Youth Camp will be coming back in I'm sure this afternoon so remember them in their travels and their doing okay Revelations 1 and I turn to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the pals with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like UND fine Bry as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters all right we'll go over to uh Genesis 1 because what we're going to do is try to go through I wanted was we were planning on having questions and answers Wednesday okay uh I just didn't seem to be right on that I wanted to make sure to review a lot of things with you to where that you would understand and then we'll have the questions and answers this afternoon all right so if you have anything write it down thoughts ideas comments questions write it down we'll try to get to it this afternoon okay Genesis 1:26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the A and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word all right now we covered a lot Wednesday trying to you know uh make sure you follow what I'm saying uh Paul said it's needful sometimes to say the same thing over and I pray that you don't get bored by hearing the same things being said but you know I want you to understand what I say all right and what I believe I don't hide anything I've never had any well you know I've got something that I just can't get to you you know I I I've got this secret thing I've never had nothing like that I I've just been always been an open book to tell you what I believe and why I believe it all right and then see that way at least you don't have to wonder what you know I'm trying to bring out you you can say well there one thing for sure we know what he believes you know he he believes in Redemption go we've heard him talk teach it you know he believes in one true and living God and we we followed that you know we've been through that many serieses and this is me this is number 40 to and we'll try to end this evening with we can on this about you know not now the title that we're using but we'll try to get into at least what we've been planning on getting into 40something Services ago all right but I think sometimes it's needful to keep repeating because repetitive things you know are easier to remember than just one label thing I have a very very bad memory for names all right I'm sorry I I have a very bad memory for names I have to be able to relate that over and over and over and over and then when I need it I can't remember it now that's not 75 okay that was 21 I've never had an ability to remember you know names and things of people but faces I never forget all right because that's part of your brain working I guess and maybe the rest of mine don't work but you know I I think that the best thing to do is just keep on repeating it they say to remember something you repeat it over you repeat it over over over over over all right so forgive me for repeating myself but remember what we're trying to bring out now we cover and have been for for a long time speaking about the Eternal God now I'm a firm believer there's only one eternal life amen all right and that's God's own life amen all right there's only one Eternal theophany and that is God's own life all right now there is only one Eternal Soul right amen so there's no way to talk about how many they are and what this there's only one Eternal all right and that's God's own life okay now but in the human mortal part see when we fail then by Falling Away then we know that we must be redeemed and that is to be where that we start our redemption in the basis of what we call the new birth bir and bringing it to the point of what is that new birth it's the birth of the word all right the words you hear see then know that will stay with us to be able to tie together throughout the stature of a perfect man throughout anything you want to speak about headstone Etc it will always have to be related to the revealed word all right now so we saw then God was eternal and we covered how there Wednesday night on the basis of him of God being that and that that one theophany is eternal life all right now we had to cover some things because it's necessary of the what and I'll keep repeating this point that there's only one Eternal God there's only one Eternal theophany all right now if you're dealing with anything Eternal then you must must relate that back to being the one doing all right and keeping that in your mind all right then remembering that mankind then the prophet brought out as we covered Wednesday night what did he say he said we bypassed the theophany to come to flesh right all right he said Jesus didn't Bice that that's right he said he become word first he became word form then he cond ascended downward to where that he would be made manifest in human flesh all right and I told you the way that I believe in one true and living God I believe the Bible that that body that we call Jesus was spoken into existence by the word Hebrews 10:5 it was the the prophets that built the body but God had to bring it into manifestation the words that they brought had to be brought together and put into to one man and then it would come out to be John uh 1:14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us all right I believe almighty God dwelt in human flesh I don't believe that he was a first person second person or a third person the prophet said he's not any of those he is the person all right cuz if you got a first person that's a possibility your statement itself means you could have a second one all right so that's the best way that a man could say it don't believe that I believe he is the person of eternal life all right that body sure it had a beginning it was a creation it wasn't created full grown as Adam was and then come into uh being you know it was the fact of it being a baby to where that it could be a Redemptive form all right it would he he he could pay cuz melzer even the best you can do with talking about melch that body was spoken into existence and out of existence and it could not be a redeemer because that wouldn't be kin folks that was just brought in and out as as was needed all right but see then that word form came into flesh all right so then being that then God the word created all things which would be as we read in in James you know we've been over it and 3 and N that Jesus Christ created all things so then he was almighty God all right but yet still it's there we got to keep the form of God as our many attributes and things to be able to follow it and not run into the one this thought all right then as we're doing and keeping it correctly the body was a creation I believe that spirit that soul that entered into that body was almighty God Amen now you got your scripture right in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily all right in him uh was God made manifest to where we could be able to see or understand him all right but then we left off at the end because it said he came as Eternal he was the word all right but you and I bypass that then did we byass it is we talking about Wednesday does it mean you bypass something when you try to 285 goes around Atlanta you know and you by pass and go around now that's that's terms that's words it it's simple to me is to just put it in PL language and simple things that we never came that way amen right but we got to put something up and byp pass around it well now where you going to get back to it we were discussing this last night in the Bible study all right and see if you ain't careful then you're going to have too many bodies running around to where that you're you're running into trouble all right but see to byass to me doesn't mean that you got to go around something that it's dire well how do I get connected back to there but it just means simply I never came that way you never came that away nobody came that way except the Lord Jesus Christ because he was almighty God all right so he came down through there condescending you know to where that he would then finally come into flesh all right and that would be to where you would see the one true and the Living God see then that would mean that his spirit as brother brandham said we gave it Wednesday and there is a copy of the quotes to some of you that wasn't here if you don't have it let us know we'll run you off a copy from the quotes Wednesday that I wanted you to keep all right so it's dealing with showing you know Christ being revealed okay all right so we never came word we came human being right amen because of the father amen all right we came into flesh all right then we must return to that but now here is what M basically most people seemingly to me thinks that we come into this world and we come through Redemption and they'll talk about justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the Redemptive form but then we'll turn around and uh we we look look at something as well I'm trying to find a wording that we're not I believe in Redemption here all right may I say it that way I don't believe we're going to heaven to be redeemed all right now that's kind of like the old style we had one day I hope I'm going I maybe I believe I'm saved but one of these days I'm going to heaven and I'll know I'm saved well you know that's that's not positive thinking Jesus never come up and said well I think I'm God maybe I'm God I hope I'm God I act like him sometimes no no he was almighty God all right I believe Redemption is to bring you and I Body Spirit and soul to the Plan of Redemption all right fulfilling the scriptures all right see then what what do I need something else somewhere else you know well I got something to go to what do you what why can't you realize where you're at now right amen I mean if you're going to e you're going to go from in this world right somebody now I contend I'm one of them you can do what you want too but you know somebody is going to even reach a change of the body right here I believe right that's it's not that we have to wait till we get up there that's right well now if you get to change of the body here and it's eternal life then are you going up to another body no I thought it was to happen here I thought we were to become the word here I thought that's what he was bringing out on who is this mzed that we are to become the word right here amen all right and to do that would be the Plan of Redemption right you know but see if not then we're looking for something else and we're like everybody basically used to be and and a lot of the message people are still that what I'm going to get a new body you know that's still taught in the message ranks after all brother randam has said about that it's not another body it's not that it's this body redeemed after all of that they're still teaching we're going to get a new body right well I don't uh I don't get to that I mean that to me is what this message brought to me amen when I first saw uh or heard this message I heard a man talking about eternal life here we was talking about eternal life there amen and hoping we was going to get there right all right but we're doing is the little girl okay or what is she's she's throwing up she went home she went home okay all right long she's okay all right now see if we don't become the word here what are we going to be here right you know what's the purpose right I I believe in Redemption here amen I believe we're going to be just as Eternal right here as we will be in heaven even the ones who must must go by the grave if I'm one of them and I must go by the grave still while I'm here I'm not coming out of the ground some kind of something and then go up to heaven and I finally find my body somewhere go I did I listened to the man that's in this message that really was talking about that you know that we're going to get a new body and and some way now some way I never did understand it but some way we'd walk out on the ashes on on our own ases in some kind of a body in the Millennium that wouldn't be real you know and we'd be walking on our ises you know but one of these days we'd connect back with that yeah well well why not get it here yeah that's right easier amen you know from my understanding of what I believe I believe we're going to be literal people in the Millennium in glorified bodies these bodies glorified Hallelujah right it's not that we're just going to be there in some theophany form and then one of these days we're going to catch back up with it there's not a lot of redemption to that there's a whole lot of waiting you know trying to get to certain places all right but you see Jesus came word form right right come all the way through as the word then stood on Earth as the word made flesh well I thought that we were to come to that Redemptive form through Jesus Christ until when we meet him in the hour that we'd already be in a glorified body well you know uh I'm just sorry that's it's the way I think at least I tell you what I think all right but now watch then see then we've got a realize reality trying to get down now you got questions write them down this afternoon I mean I don't Bo it don't bother me for you to say brother Dale I don't understand what in the world are you talking about that don't bother me at all it's when you go away and tell everybody else you don't know what I'm talking talking about right and you go home and you talk and you you know you don't you don't let me know at least maybe you maybe I word things wrong maybe I state things wrong I'm just a human being but I at least tell you and I keep repeating to make sure that you don't misunderstand me right right because I know it's easy to do it I know you're sitting there I've seen people I've had people to come and tell me said brother Dale you said so and so and I said I didn't say that yes you did you said so and so son I said I didn't say that well yes you did I said okay we'll just pull the tape we'll play the tape find out where who's right because that's what we got to T for well see most of the time that solves a problem because they figure if you enough to say I'm going to go pull a tape that you're you pretty well know you didn't and if I did say it that way that would with what I meant see it to me I believe right here is where the Redemptive part is amen amen that when we meet him in the air we're going to what our bodies lack un his glorious body all right then we'll live it through the millennial Reign even though the Millennium is not to us the time is not to us it has no meaning to us in the Millennium you know what I mean in time wise because we'll already be Eternal all right but see do we get redemption or do we just make our own ideas our thoughts about things okay we can see how he came forth into being it's what I was doing Wednesday but then we seen that we bypassed the way we should have come right we should have come without sin that's fine but we bypass that that's right and we came to flesh to be tempted all right and then here we receive the word according to who is MDC and then we can go there because we become that word hearer all right now in doing that then what is a human being I spent a lot of time so let's deal a little bit about ourselves and then we'll get to a thought a minute brother Bram says it like this they don't have to pull all of these up until I call for them but on possess the Gate of the enemy brother Brandon says the human being that what has a soul all right so we know that right animal doesn't have a soul right if the animal had a soul then you wouldn't need Jesus Christ because the Redemptive plan would have been made through the animal the animal doesn't have a soul all right it is a body it is a spirit form yes but it does not have a soul to be able to redeem but how real do you think about as I tried to emphasize Wednesday was how real do you think God is now you know that I've preached that for some of you have been around here for 40 years and you know that's what I've always tried to get you to believe how real God is Prophet said he's not like the wind right he said if he was you wouldn't have to seek the Holy Ghost cuz it'd be in everything but he's a being but see we we look then we'll get well what form was God in before he became the word I think whatever form he ends up is a form of what he started that's the best I can say it may not be a good way of saying it but every how he started is how he's going to end that's right so whatever he's going to be that way he has to be that way or Hebrews 13:8 is wrong all right so I believe he was real before the world he didn't become Real by his condescending I've tried my best to get you to see that that he didn't come this way and become real he come this way to manifest how real he was right well I just can't see God before the world as being real well why can't you you know why you can't you're still hung in trinitarianism right sorry you're still hung in it because your thoughts is still on that days and hours and things instead of taking the prophet's message and realizing you know who he is and how real he is all right now if you see God is real if you see that God is real and he's not a thought of your imagination he's not something just like a Spirit floating around but he's real and the prophet we gave him Wednesday to you where it said he had a house y he lived in a place called Heaven that's right well what kind of a world was it what kind will it be when it's finished right you can figure out what kind of it'll be why when it's finished the prophet talked about a place called future home and he talked about streets but not that we needed cars and not that kind he talked about the tree of life he talked about the river running through the garden he talked about a world but a beautiful Eternal situation well why can't we believe that that's what it was before we started right amen cuz you see we're making ourselves greater than he is I I keep going over that because I don't want you to I don't want you to lose that thought at least you know that I believe in God being real not just a thought or imagination or or something when we get up to our and we're going to look around there be something floating around well our is a father Our Father how you doing ours the Holy Ghost and our no the Bible says we'll have bodies like under his glorious body so we'll be able to Fellowship throughout eternity am in an eternal body and sister Gail I have never believed that when you get there that you're going to look like somebody else you're going to look like you why can't we believe that why can't we believe that this is the body that we'll live in but made Eternal take away the scars take away the pimples take away the the things you take away the lines you know the age things the chicken tracks take away all of that the fat blubber hey I got one to right ra her hand take away all of that and bring us to a beautiful perfect State and that we'll live like that through eternity amen well you'll see that I really do believe in Redemption all right but the prophet of God said you are a soul that's what you are right mhm a soul a being a person that if death strikes us the body goes to the Grave the spirit goes back to God who gave it the soul goes beyond the curtain of time why can't we believe that and see brother Dale don't understand everything brother Luis brought up a question last night in the Bible study about that Spirit going back to God who gave believe it was him somebody brought it up and you know what I caught something while everybody was discussing that that helped me to understand because I've always wondered about that myself brother dick and I've always talked about that the spirit goes back to God who gave it but I've always told him and always have believe you can't take something sinful back to God right you can't do that but I it really struck me and maybe this is you know when that baby is born that spirit that comes into that body that baby is born is perfect right not not Eternal not Eternal let don't go okay perfect perfect why because God can't create anything imperfect the baby learns to be imperfect you know it learns to lie it learns to do right but it's created Perfect all right I step out of this body there's a lot of problems in my memory my reason my conscience my spirit being that I am inside of there with a spirit we call it now we're not going to I've always believed that you can't take that sinful back into the presence of God nowhere can it stand in the presence of God so then evidently when I leave this earth and my spirit goes back to God who gave it All of Me ain't me Spirit ain't going CU me spirit is bad stuff all of that going to be wiped away but the spirit that is perfect that I started with can go back to God to wait a time that it can come back to reite you reunite with the body and I said okay I I got some thinking now I at least think on that but maybe you don't understand my terminologies the things that are wrong in me can't go in the presence of God and I have wrong memories wrong Consciousness but the Bible says the former things is what passed away so when a person dies the former things of his spirit will never be able to go into the presence of God in the form of the wrong Parts but the perfect part can go there no problem now with that I can see that so I got some help myself questions and answers help me it ain't brother Dale knowing everything I'm learning too you know and ever learning in the word of God all right but get back to the reality see we look at the body as thinking it's real because we can feel it we can do with it see you know we look at the spirit because it has the memories the reason the Consciousness and we we make that real but just remember the soul is more real than either one of those too right but see we want to we want to bring it just like well the soul is just a nature of the spirit no it's not just the nature of the spirit I want one quote where it's just the nature of the spirit I can give you plenty where he says it's the nature of the spirit but you can't take you don't bring that to it's just the nature of the spirit because you're just making it like a dog it's a bird dog and there another was a hound dog and this over here is this dog this over here that dog you're just making it like a dog no the soul of man is real the Bible says a soul that sinth it shall die right right so matter no matter whether we're a sinner or a saint we have a soul that makes the difference between us and the Animals we are a being a person all right and in doing that then brother Bram says you are what you are on the message uncertain s you are what you are by your soul all right you remember what I gave the other day on it it's in one of these quotes where brother brandom is explaining the lie detector and the lie detector comes out from that inside let's see if I can find that I'll talk long enough to find something but I'll do it let's see uh because really what I like is this I like on the message uncertain sound where he says it like this but down on the inside of you in the subconscious lays a place called the soul in the subconscious your soul is what governs you you are what you are by your soul I believe that all right y see nothing has a soul but man Man was created in the image of God y now that was not body right cuz that's the image of the animal that was not Spirit but it was the soul of man all right created in the image of God so when Jesus Christ came back on the day of Pentecost according to the message called the token paragraph 31 not only did the soul of a man come or a spirit of a man but God himself and he goes on into the Israel in the church and he says he sent back his soul in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe that all right see then that push us into that place Amen to where the soul is the real you all right it's not just some thoughts right or ideas it's the real you but now there goost to where or not did you believe now I'm going I'm putting it right back on the message what if you believe that your soul is not real then you don't believe God is real all right I'll let you think about that a little bit if you don't think the soul of mankind is more real than the body and spirit that you see standing before you and talking to you the you don't believe that God is real but but I just can't understand do you mean there's something standing inside of me no it's what's standing in front of you death takes this being that I am and brings it into reality is the soul but I just never have believed your soul why can't you believe that your soul is real right amen amen animals don't know right and wrong right what makes a difference is you is the soul that that's doing it all right now that makes you to understand I'll find that in a minute if you don't I'll get it to you later of where he was talking about the lie detector's test see that lie detector's test is working off of that soul that you are right but see we we we don't want to think about us as being real why not come on if man is created in the image of God is God not real amen right amen well well if God is just a floating Spirit just rolling along this then man is a floating Spirit rolling along and brother randam taught it as what as we read there in Genesis that there was a spiritual Man created in the image of God and then there was a physical Man created in the image of the animal and the spiritual man was placed into the natural man and he breathed into the ad into nostrils of Adam and he became an eternal person is that Blasphemous names well see then it's it's real but the part we bypassed was that part that's Eternal we didn't come come that way it wasn't it was we was eternal and we bypassed it and then become Eternal no we just didn't become Eternal Adam did Adam and Eve were the only one you shorten the prophet's message you show me where anybody else comes with eternal life because God breathes into their nostrils as a living Soul see we would have never known nothing about ad had the prophet not come with that we would have thought about Adam just being like the rest of us no his soul was eternal why because Genesis 1 went into Genesis 2 right all right now as I started off with a statement there's just one eternal life amen there's just one Eternal theophany there's just one Eternal Soul all right so God has to deal with you and I and see that's where we bypass that part of what it should have been okay I turn back and find it I want you to pay attention this is a message y UNC sign you can go ahead and pull up number four if you want you put a li DET tecture on you and you try to impersonate that that truth and try to say that it's truth but down on the inside of you in the subconscious lays a place called the soul and this intellectual mind does not govern that vibration of the system right and this intellectual mind does not govern that vibration of the system the mind is only a director it will direct you and it's very capable of bringing you to God right your mind you cannot know God by your mind intellectual it's one of the resources or the channels that would lead you to it but your soul is what governs you you are what you are by your soul see the L detector doesn't work off your spirit cuz like I told you you can take a pen and they can ask you a question and you take a pen and stick it into your body the machine's going to record a reaction right but if they hold you there and don't let you do none of that you can't lie from the soul it's the soul of man that can't lie the spirit and the body lies all the time always has been but the soul can't lie cuz that's the real you but that seems to be the hardest thing maybe for me to comprehend okay if we think about well brother Dale I see your body I see your AC I do where's your soul that's what I am that's what I am amen right death puts me in another position right that the soul can become come into capable of being seen as we'd call it or whatever cuz what about the man on the road that the prophet spoke of the old man in the Overcoat what about him he was real enough to make the car lunge he was real enough for everybody to see him you know for some to see him what about it he wasn't in his physical body right but we don't want to think about something like that being real you know the reason we don't want to think about real we don't want to deal with it we don't want to deal with ourselves amen we wanted to stay out in the body realm the spirit realm and deceive everybody come to church be good do all the things we was in that last night in the Book of Romans right but the soul is the real you right and no matter am I quoting the prophet no matter whether it's sinner or Saint it's in the image of God come on it's a Supernatural part of a being whether it's sinner or Saint right a sinner has a a old as well as and that's what I've tried for all of these years to explain why brother Brandon would come on and say it's page 80 of the old Hebrew Book it's paragraph 279 of the that he would say that that man let's get down to that part because if you're not going to get it we're not going to worry about it so let's go to number 10 remember what I'm saying now he sent back his soul in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost now let me Express something right there that we think of as I said the other day that we think that this when brother Brown said it's you and God together as persons well is he inside of here or standing beside of here or where's he at as I said if we bypassed something what was it eternal life right we bypassed eternal life we bypassed coming like Adam did that's right all right see then is it two people standing or does God simply come down and bring his nature into you of eternal life see that way you can see the old nature can die and brother Brown will call it the soul that's fine but remember he's not dealing with taking you out and putting God in that's right I've always tried to explain that to you Adam was Adam we'll get down in a minute we get time we don't we C it this evening brother BR said Eve was in Adam and theophany I see that they only had one theophany right I see that and there's only one soul but now watch Eve had a soul and Adam had a soul that's human being Parts but there's only one theophany there's only one Eternal theophany there's only one Eternal Soul all right so watch what he's saying now and when man be come into that body he had control of the fishes now who's he talking about we ain't never had control of the fishes we ain't never had a control of the Beast they're under our subjection but no they're not we're that's his Adam right that's the way we should have come right and if we' have come that way with no sin that would have been us right but we didn't come that way we bypassed so watch what he say and then there was no man to the saw him see he done made male and female well Adam and Eve but there's no man to till the soil then God made Man Out of the Dust of the earth and rolled it on up he gave him a hand like a chimpanzee he's like a dog he's a material like a horse but the difference between an animal and a man God put a soul in a man he didn't put it in the animal because the soul that was in the man is that theophany all right now if there's only one one theophan we're talking about eternal life theop that's right every human being has a soul right every human being is a soul better to say than has a soul has a soul is a different terminology he is a soul he is a being he's a person all right and he has a body to go to when he dies whether it be heaven or whether it be hell he's going somewhere who's going he's not his body in the grave rotten in the way not his Spirit he got to move out go somewhere cuz you can't take that wrong Spirit to God his soul that's it will live on somewhere that's right whether he's a Christian or not right amen your soul is the real you and you're going to stand there one day in that Soul amen and be judged God can bring back the body and let you stand there that's fine but the soul that sinth it shall die you ain't concerned with the body all right cuz watch now in Adam brother R I said is explaining Adam Adam in the Hebrew Book he ain't explaining all of us he's explaining Adam right just like he is on Blasphemous names when he's explaining that God breathed into Adam eternal life amen he didn't breathe into you and me eternal life when we was born that's right but he breathed into Adam eternal life but he didn't breathe into the rest all right but think about it now think with me a little bit and just consider the thought you know consider what I've tried to explain for almost 50 years not seeing it all as I see it now I agree I'm no problem I'm still learning all right but you see if a person dies they're going somewhere it's just not Spirits floating around around there's a place to go to that's right you can deal with show goana Hades in in calling hell because it's really not the word hell is not there it's it's dealing with a place to go and brother random says it's like a falling the center dead is The Fifth Dimension the Christian in whatever form they're in is a sixth Dimension and don't ask ask me to explain that because I can't if I'd have been God I would have said that the Fifth Dimension is five in number of Grace and good and that would be the good people and six would be the bad people cuz the number of man is six but I'm not God so I didn't get to say it right that's good all right he's the one that said it through the prophet well there's a reason for all that being that way because it's got to be in those dimensional things amen it's just like Jesus was in the seventh Dimension right brother Brandon said I want to go there he said you can't go there right you couldn't go on into the seventh Dimension to where God was he had to deal in the sixth Dimension sold under the altar all right but do you understand a sinner has a body to go to it can be called it's theop a Christian has a body to go to it can be called your theophany right one of them's Eternal and one of them's not one of them has a downward current is that the way we brought it the prophet said the other one has an upward current all right when we're born into the natural world we're born going downward that's right right everybody priest king don't matter Prophet priest king whoever it is except Jesus Christ is born with a downward current all right but then when you're born again you turn and start upwardly that's right now as we gave from who is this m brother randam says when you're formed into that word part he said you heard from you theophany come on because why because right here at Faith as you're born again you heard from this love up here that's what's drawing us that's the positive of God's mind that's drawing us upward I believe in every bit of that I believe the soul is not complete as a prop he say he only got the earnest right that's right right the positive is drawing us when this when this grows up into this position and The Headstone United then somebody's going out of here am all right but do you understand what I've tried to bring to you cuz it's what I've tried to whether you agree with me or not that's up to you you're going to have to pray to God to let him talk to you all right I know that's not a popular thought to think about your soul being your theophany but why not well I've always believed I got one up there all right now let me illustrate it you're born again right here right right you know that's what's pulling you right where's it at it's pulling you what's the problem I'm connected to it I heard from The Headstone when I received the new birth right and I've taught you what I believe now F I believe it I believe this message is The Headstone to the body of Christ because that was the thing that was not brought when brother R said The Headstone ain't come yet I said wait just a minute now you mean you got all of this and all of that but then it struck me one day his message caps off everything if not you better look for something else to come to bring you another message right that's right I'm not looking for something else to come I'm looking at this message to be revealed to you and I to be made manifest amen why can't we we'll get into Masterpiece one day and brother Ram even says it like this where he says that Mary represented of zeusa street he said because she was a carrier of the word but somebody's not going to be a carrier come on that's got to happen to you and I all right but listen then to a sinner he has a place to go to when he dies it's not D it's waiting for him to die it's pulling him yeah it's drawing him right the best we think we are don't worry about it an unregenerated person has got a downward pull I don't care what you want to call it upwards you got it all messed up it's it's pulling somewhere else all right but when you're born again and see we got to be born again to be in the body of Christ right then that starts an upward pull from Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience call starts pulling us upward are being born again as Peter would call it right by the what Incorruptible word of God go cuz that's what I asked brother Mo when he taught that 19 in 71 right into 72 he taught the statue of perfect man and it was wonderful to understand those things but I asked him one question I said how do I get those virt and it never was revealed to me until about 1980 right in there when I preached the seals the first time and I began to see some things of prophet was saying and as I begin to see those things I realize what the Bible was saying that you're being born again by The Incorruptible word of God how do you get virtue well I just I just need virtue so I'll just be good brother said that's not a virgin life virtues he said it means power what's going to bring you the power the Bible says what you shall receive power you shall receive virtue after the the Holy Ghost has come upon you amen right see the opening of the word will bring the vires into being I don't believe the seventh under virture message part now because to them really they were saying uh I'll tell you when you're going to get it and I'll tell you whether you got it or not well I ain't never told none of you whether you got it or not and I've always told you the Lord ain't told me where I'm at the only thing the Lord ever spoke to me about the statute of perfect man he said if you'll have patience with the people said it'll prove you got patience now that's all the statement I can tell you he ain't never told me you're here you're there you're doing no he just simply made the statement if you'll have patience with the people then it'll prove you got patience well I thought that's all right I'll stay right there and if that's as far as I go I ain't worried about it I talking to brother Howard Carl the other day and reminded him of what I'd heard he said he said one way or the other I'm going somewhere pretty quick cuz he's he's 80 I think maybe even a little over 80 well we're going somewhere pretty quick one way or the other either by the grave or by change that's right right cuz we ain't going to stay around here too much longer like I told you if it keeps on going where it's going we're going to be having services in the nursing home right because that's where we're going to be but listen church do you see what I'm talking about when a person is created brought into being I tried to explain this I believe now as that baby begins to develop we know that it doesn't record anything until the age of accountability right God doesn't count all of that but that but when that age of accountability comes into being whatever it is and it could be a difference from everybody so we ain't worried about it but when it does you become to know the difference in right and wrong and you know what then your nature is being molded your soul is being built I believe that it took 75 years to build me what I am I believe that all right 1969 I tell tell you and I believe that was the year of my new birth after I'd been in the message for 2 or 3 years all right don't count all of the things that's happened as my new birth I count the birth of the word all right when everybody else was going haywire in 1976 going into 1977 you know where I stood and that I stood right here and said you get away from the dates and the times and the seasons in 1974 I preached we could go past the year 2026 nobody wants to know how come I believe that or why I put that number on it but you know what we're gaining on it right 11 years I might not be able to make it to that place but hey it's pretty close this is 2015 but you know what everybody else was saying you know what I'm saying right that everybody was saying we're going to be out of here in 77 I said you're messing up the prophet's message I said you're making statements that he didn't make he said don't you say that the 77 I'm going out of here right you know what he wanted it way before then right I did too but I knew what it could go to and I'm still know what it can go to it can go a long time cuz see I've upgraded from that 2026 to say now we can go to the year of 4,000 and not break the message 5,000 10,000 I sure don't want to cuz I know for certainty you and I ain't going to be around here but that's the Bible cuz once you entered 1977 instead of it being where everybody started sending their books back that was the year it began to open to me to say here is where it's at it's not a year it's Christ all right see did I begin to preach about God being real and I begin to try to bring things into to our understanding that we could comprehend better than to just well we're waiting on a bus to pull up uh you know something's going to happen I begin to preach that if it was you know what I preached you know if you believe a bus is going to pull up and get you one day you know what somebody's going to have to produce a bus do you understand what I mean by that right if you're believing a bus has got to pull up somebody's got to make a bus that was the one that got me when that brother was was telling me you know that that they create that had that airplane waiting on brother Brown to come back I'm not throwing off on him I'm throwing off on his statement cuz he said we got the airplane we said it' take two years to get that airplane flyable you didn't think about what he say he saying the Lord couldn't come for two years cuz in our airplane ready now ain't that something you know where I stand I've made myself plain we're going to have 30 40 days after the resurrection I ain't got no problems I just got problems with your ideas and my ideas that won't tie with the rest of the word of God right that's right we this to me is creating the bus if you want call it that he's trying to bring the bus into being is our understanding of the word of God is going to have to bring things to a place that God can move on the scene that's right if not what are we doing here why not eat drink and be married forget it cuz it won't be long we all get out of here why not just put it like he's saying it like I said then to Adam God breathed into his nostrils the breath of eternal life his own life into Adam he put in Adam the soul I believe that that would come forth which would be his theophany all right then there's only one Eternal theophany so Genesis 1:26 and 27 is talking about a multiple form of that one person which is Jesus Christ believe that all right and our soul is now at the Y but you say let's go to that but we we're not going to get through let's go to that go ahead brother and pull up uh I got it in here but pull up second Corinthians pull up 2 Corinthians 5 if you want to get into your Bible and read it we can do it but we'll read it off the screen what does it say about this people call the theophany the things put up 2 Corinthians 5 for we know that so that's the ones on the computer they can pull it up in a hurry now watch what he says for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved that's not your house you own at home that's not where you rent an apartment okay that you that's a body that's a human parts and things right we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens so the prophets right that before the foundation of the world and the Bible's right that the Morning Star saying together and the sons of God shattered for Joy but what they explain that his being he said that was in the mind of God right right amen right come on now for in this we grown earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked all right but in this Tabernacle we do groan being burdened m not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortal might be swallowed up of life right roll it back down to verse one and let's read it okay for we know if question our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens now that can't be talking to the sinner right so we're we're going to exclude him because the Bible is not written to The Sinner it is written only to the Christian to the Saints it's not written to The Sinner it's written to the Saints so what the Saints the Born Again Believers if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved bringing it bringing it to a present tense form if it were dissolved we have one waiting is it waiting or is it there the second we step over there right which one is it in God's mind it's waiting right in God's mind everybody that will ever receive the headstone in his mind has already got it right true right but that don't mean we've got it what did we give you and ask you to read where brother brand talking about on Hood this meled where he says we have not yet the bodies well see we want something up there because we we're we're we're satisfied with that God can do something up there but we're not satisfied with what he's doing here I thought this was the most important part I thought you were supposed to have read and who is this Mel chedic that if you wasn't the word to start with you would never be the word you remember that statement if you wasn't the word to start with see that way I believe that all born again Believers had eternal life before the world ever begun in God's mind but not in reality but in God's mind so then my soul is my theophany as it says about Adam because see I'm born again now if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved I just step right over believe is it there waiting on me now I'll express it this way and I'll stop and we'll have the questions and answers this evening because that's what we were talking about last night if we believe in justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost we believe that justification is the work of the Holy Ghost sanctification is the work of the Holy Ghost but the baptism is the Holy Ghost and that's where eternal life comes into being right so you have eternal life in your soul by the new birth right right well then we just read that that body that a lot of people wants is eternal in the heavens right I thought there was only one form of eternal life think about that I didn't think there was four parts of this thing now there's four in restoration don't misunderstand me but there's three stages to life justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost makes that Soul Eternal amen all right they don't make the body and the spirit eternal right it makes the soul Eternal all right and we're being born again by The Incorruptible word as we hear it and it's revealed to us we're gaining upward ground coming more into the positive of what we should be but you see no matter what you say or how many times you say it people are still going to hold on to their thoughts that they had right well I've got a body up you waiting on me and how is it in the message they do right they sing a song about my theophany being up somewhere else and you're going to take a song over the word of God and I have no problem with the song right it's a beautiful song but you see the day you was born again you heard from the positive of God's mind of what you will be in this world but that day your soul became an upward current right which would mean a the aony of God right because that soul is eternal amen right justification doesn't make it Eternal sanctification doesn't make it Eternal the new birth makes it Eternal God's Own Life coming in you amen coming into your and making your soul Eternal right but you see we go into all of that you know but but is it two people or is it to let me answer the question like this until we heard of this prophet's message I'm sorry I'm sorry to make this statement but I'll make it until we heard of this prophet's message we didn't know what a soul was we didn't know what a spirit was we didn't even hardly know what a body was right right but we have become to the we didn't know the word theophany you never heard that in our denominations we didn't know logos and we didn't know that until we come into the message but how we become then so intellectually educated until now we know the whole plan but I thought that we could go back and study the message of Jesus and saying why it starting off that you must be born again and that it would be picked up by their disciples and they would preach about eternal life and the great apostles Paul would even prophesy of the future of the coming of the Rapture you know be changed in a moment twinkl and I yet he never left us dangling and Peter wouldn't when he would say Being Born Again by The Incorruptible word of God but those people had to go by the grave because they didn't attain un that's right what they spoke of righten but some body is not going to go by the grave amen so we're going to become Eternal here right so this is the main place I want to stay you know I want to stay right here where God is dealing with mankind amen I'd like to be here when the change comes I'd like to see it amen but if I don't I'm not worried about it sister Ceta used to say if I go by the grave you remember this one she said I'll just beat you up see cuz you're going to raise first that's probably 40 years ago right maybe a little more than that that statement was made I got a decent memory about some things you and to me that's a good point if I die I just beat you up I'm going to be up before you get your change so it's not worried about the Rapture I'm concerned with the preaching of the Gospel to get the dead raised that's it cuz that's the next step the next step is a dead to be raised then the Rapture will come that we all go up together right but I don't believe the Dead's going to raise corruptible that's right right I don't believe that the Dead's going to raise and then we got to preach something to them to make their bodies Eternal I don't think that now I think that that's going to be that part but I think that's why the Bible says they without us cannot be made complete is that the word perfect amen complete without you and I so they're waiting on you and I amen that's right we've got the message that's right we're not looking for another messenger come on that's right well why do you want to rear greet want to rear some out of the gre's almanac you know it's good to find out how to plant but I always tell everybody they say gre's Almanac says according to the Moon I don't plan on the moon I plant in the ground would you understand what I'm saying come on Brothers musicians I believe that every person has a body that they step over into the second death takes you you step in not step over into that's right it's just you going somewhere you just exit this part amen that everybody can see Hallelujah and if you're a born again Christian you just exit this and right into eternity as far as being it but it's already Eternal but R said I don't believe in what the Mormon doctrine of pre-existence 154 Church age book transmigration or reincarnation he didn't believe transmigration means to go from one body to another is there a body up there waiting on us to step into that body or is that body the body of the word as he's revealing it to you he amen that way I believe your soul is your theophany then there's only one theophany that's Eternal that's it so Genesis 1:26 and 27 is talking about you that are a born again believer this day when it says let us make man in our image that man is eternal am y but you must receive it to have eternal life amen not just a knowledge that this message come we understand this out of the other no brother Bram said what we need to baptism of the Holy Ghost more than anything it's the most important thing in your life that's right is whether or not you're born again let's stand together what we got 16 spiral book transition Earth can build your things ET God brother Dale you don't believe we got something up there the positive of God's mind is pulling us don't ever say that I don't believe in something positive pulling up don't say that I don't believe in being born again by The Incorruptible word The Plan of Redemption brought to us God's unchanging to understand and trust in him who will not by Earthly friends for I was talking with Brother Gary the other day and I said here we are talking about eternal life here we are talking about a change and yet you're laying there in that condition I've seen the dead raise I don't worry about that but you know what you're not going to make it work you're not going to make it work don't you ever get that idea it's when God comes down himself cuz only God can raise the dead you said well why don't you just speak the word I have I said Brother Gary I Believe by Stripes you're healed they will never pass away I believe that beyond that I cannot go any further now come on you say but if Jesus was standing here he could raise him he couldn't do it if the father didn't tell him your don't take it too far now he could not do it if the father didn't tell it journey is completed if you're dismissed remember the service this evening father just be with everybody and take care of in Jesus name glory for your in rapture
