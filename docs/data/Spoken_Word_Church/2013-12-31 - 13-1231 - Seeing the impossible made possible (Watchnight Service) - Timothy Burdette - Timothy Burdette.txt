I believe if you need anything I believe he'll give it to you you believe that let's sing this and we'll get right into the word if you don't mind I stood on the banks of a wide raging River trusting I'd get across I've made my way through some Valley and deserts believeing I'd never get lost I stood on the feet of what felt like Mount Everest knowing I have the strength for the clim oh but through every trial each test and Temptation one thing is sure every time over and over again and again God is faithful and over and over again and again through it all he makes me able to stand and survive to come through Al when it sure looks like I just can't win Jesus is with me I claim the victory over and over [Applause] again now if you ask me why I've got no hesitation God does everything he said he'll do I'd simply say every battle has taught me there's nothing he won't help me through so why should I listen now dwell on the hardships and struggles if I look just beyond them I can see that the way this will end is with great celebration and deep in my heart I believe that over and over again and again God is faithful said over and over again and again through it all he makes me aable to stand and survive to come through alive when it seems like I just can't win oh but Jesus is with me I claim the victory over and over again all to stand and survive to come through a life when it sure looks like I just can't win Jesus is with me I claim the victory over and over [Music] again y'all forgive me I tore my I tore four weeks ago I fell and tore my shoulder all the pieces and uh it's giving me some fits so they want to go in I got to go back to a specialist next week and they want to go in there and do some cutting and all that stuff which I ain't too find of so we'll just have to wait and see what they what takes what they do but right God's good ain't he do you love him my name's Timothy berett I got brother Tim ml with me he's uh he's been with me now for 12 13 years and I think brother Tim has and he's my he's a a great Minister and uh only thing about it I don't like him going outside of my church to preach cuz he's my help but he's been out a couple of times he is a great Minister a great help to me and he is also my trumpet player play a trumpet man like I have never heard in my life this guy can play but it's good to be with you I know Brother Sam we we seen each other several years ago in Indiana right at the Tabernacle and then uh brother Wade uh I remember him and he came over the other day and we got to fellowshiping a little bit and so one thing led to the other but here we are and it is good to be in the house of God with you we're coming out of a one year and going into another and uh there's all kind of uh problems trials test troubles that you're facing that I'm facing the world is facing the only difference is we've got somebody to face them with us they look for the government to do help them or this person or this or that we only have one person we call him Jesus Christ but I believe he's the one that can really help us I believe he's the one that can do what we need to be done and if we ask him I believe he'll do that for us do you believe that but we are glad to be in service with you tonight I am not a long-winded preacher and brother Tim them tells me every now and then I am a long- windy preacher but I said if y'all could just feel what it feels like standing there it's hard to quit sometimes right but uh then they said they have service to about 5 out 12 here I said I told my church Sunday night I says but I'm going to make use of that time but I won't do you that way so we get to hear some more singing and fellowship later on but the word is the most important part and we love the word amen I uh trying to find the mind of the Lord and to uh say the right things that will be a help to you a blessing to you things that you need not just things that's you know I want to preach and say something Brother Sam that will help the people and that's the most important thing and I'm a I'm a big Minister on preaching on overcoming because I believe that that's one big thing today is we need to overcome and be an overcomer and I want to look at a little thought you know uh I spoke at my church a here a while back and I've kind of put several things together as I was looking at it this morning and pray and in my study to be able to speak to you tonight so we just pray that he'll come and just open his word and I think everything be a lot better off so if you come to hear him I think you'll be okay think you'll be okay and I do believe the message 100% believe this message I do read a few quotes if that's all right with you and uh I've never been here to to this place and I think we but I it was closer than I thought Brother Sam when I started out so uh we ain't far from you at all but we'll get over here and fellowship with y'all sometimes and and one of these days Brother Sam we won't have to leave be on the other side we won't have to leave but appreciate you coming tonight may the Lord richly bless you may something be said that would encourage you as we uh and I do love amens I do love I'm a preacher at loves amen so if you'll get in there and amen we'll get in there and have church and we'll have a good time you know it don't matter if it's five here 10 here 100 here five it don't matter God don't care right all God needs is somebody to get out of the way and let him come in and everything will be all right but I want to preach on a little subject called seeing the impossible made possible seeing the impossible made possible are conquering conquering overcoming speaking of conquering speaking of overcoming the impossible things that people think that are impossible that Satan gets us to see this impossible what he's done Brother Sam he's took in this hour and took fear and gried the people's lives with it he took worry brother M said worry causes cancer worry does this and all these things he said but what Satan's done he's took fear and he's gripped the people's lives with it and they stand today in fear right but I believe we've got a God that we don't have to be in that kind of fear if you would have your bibles if you would stand with me just one more time I would appreciate it in Jude 1 uh just for little scripture reading here for just a minute or two and then we'll go right into the word let me read you this little quote if you don't mind why you're turning there brother M says in the message of Grace he said now a lot of you Bible readers say that says profess and profess and confess is the same word he says see and he says made the high priest he said in the book of Hebrews third chapter making intercessions Upon Our confession then he can't do nothing until we first confess that he's done it right now listen he said see you get down here at the altar and pray all night wouldn't do you a bit of good unless you believe that he forgives you then you stand up then as much Faith as you have that's where he saidou once live way down here in the muck of sin you young convert converts he says you believe you're saved he said you've raised up here you raised a little higher he said what does that your faith because you believe you're a Christian now you'll live above these things now see if you want a little if you want to raise a little higher have a little bit more faith CZ it's unlimited just keep on climbing and an impossible can be made real amen now listen an impossible can be made real all things are possible to them that believeth that's right if you say to this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart but believe what you say come to pass you can have what you say right listen friends that didn't stop when brother Bram died exactly amen and that's what I've run across is preaching from different places what I have seen within the ranks of this message people don't believe that no more right but the same God that was with William Brown is the same God that's with me the same God is with Brother Sam brother Tim and you different Brothers if there's any ministers here and even to the body of Jesus Christ see we what we've done Brother Sam we'll limit it to the ministry limit no God he's the same for the believer brother B said if you believe in your the scripture says in Mark 11:22 23 24 didn't say if a minister does it he said if ye don't doubt in your heart when you ask B then it shall be given so it don't take a minister to do it you can do it you believe that in Jude 1 verse three beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the Comm of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you now listen very closely it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly oh God contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints right not another gospel the same Faith right he says for there are certain men crept in unawares oh my who were before all o ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lves and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ amen contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints you can be seated Revelations 22 I want to read the little scripture there Revelations 22:1 17 and the spirit and the bride says the same thing right amen they say come and let him that heareth say come let him that a thirst come whosoever will let him take Water of Life freely for I testify unto every man that Hearth the words of the prophets of this book If any man shall proph If any man shall add unto these things God shall add un the plagues that are written in this book If any man shall take away from the words of this book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book The Lord At His blessings to the reading of the word now we begin to look at this little subject here it's a wonderful subject I believe it'll encourage you and help you as we open tomorrow be a new year we never would actually even thought we'd be in 2014 as a as a as a I was raised in the message my dad come into the message preaching this message in 1968 uh and then from that I was born 65 and then from that time on he's been preaching this message and he went out the scene in 1992 February and then I've had the church and we didn't have a pastor for several years and you one come in and left you know how all this goes and then God began to deal with me and uh I moved into the position that God I felt the Lord wanted me to be in so I've been in that position now at Life Tabernacle for 15 years and I'm going to be honest with you I never would have thought coming up as a young man in this message and being raised by a message parents you would have never made me believe we'd ever step foot to 2013 much less 2014 yeah well the Tim of you was raised in as as I was and he believes and sees I'm sure y'all see the same thing but I want you to realize it if if it does last to 2014 15 16 whatever he's still the same God God don't change right and that's what's so good about it God don't change no let me sh I'm gonna read just a few quotes and I'm gonna get right into my thought if that's all right with you brother says he said now that's how I'll have to come pass come to pass we've got it right here he said says here we are organizations the mark of the beast is upon us just exactly like the first Beast an image unto it a Federation of churches joining of power and they made a image unto the Beast and if if he could both speak it it it done the same thing the first Beast did before right in our clutches he said what time is it is there a POS is there it possible Samson stands there and says what time he said Samson happened to think that great God he's om omnipresent he's the Everlasting God I see my mistake he says I'm going to repent and he cried out that there is a possible that we could do the same thing it's possible we could do the same thing Oh my he said they of that day this day don't see the Visions like Samson if we could only see the visions of this start right now right now this is possible again he says they stood and watched Jesus perform Miracles and so forth declared himself to be the Messiah they just couldn't see it he said they've got eyes but they can't see they're blind Glory he said Samson was blind but here's what Samson recognized that the church has never come to it yet now listen what he says he said here's what Samson recognized but he was blind but the church has never come to it yet right means he's still given us time to get there right notice he said they haven't come through yet he knew there was it was possible to come back if the church could only see that but the people of today don't seem to catch that Vision they don't seem to catch it that it is possible it doesn't come through now he said you can shout a little more Pat your hands a little more dance a little more he said that isn't in it it's back to the word there it is possible of coming back and getting the word on the inside again you bypassed it there notice there he said they sat tight oh sure they clap your hands yes sir but you see thou the sails without an anchor right now here we see how far that they had gotten away from the Lord if you read the scripture there in Jude where it talked about the earnestly contending for the faith if I'm not mistaken it was like brother brother Sam 33 years and they had come to the place in their life that they were so backslid 33 years here and Jude begins to come and prophesy here how they need to get back to contend for the very faith that the Saints once had and that's what this message is to do this message didn't come just to get us a bunch of make us a bunch of lazy Christians come on church this church this message didn't come to make me a lazy Minister make you a bunch of lazy congregation or lazy this and lazy that it came to pull us back this message come that Pro God sent that Prophet to bring us back right back to the same Faith they had not a different faith not another Faith the same thing that made this work it will work now amen the same faith that Peter had same faith that Paul these great Saints not something different the faith notice it says the faith that was once right so you mean to tell me brother sister that once they once believed it like this come on but then they begin to get into a backsliding condition but then God begin to send ministers down through the church ages all the way through and that church age reformers said them reformers come and they begin to reform bringing it back to the word amen see and that's what this this this great message that God sent through a prophet that's what it's done today amen it's done the same identical thing is to bring his brother M just didn't reform he was that Prophet that stood there that would break and bring that word to Vindication on now notice the word once oh I love this means once and for all Hallelujah it don't mean it don't mean something else that word once when Jew speaks this once means once and for all both once and again listen both once and again twice several times repeatedly so if it comes brother Tim it's got to deliver the same thing that it did that you can't take the message that they preach and preach that they expect it to bring something else if we believe like they did it bring bring the same results but see what we've done in this message we're looking for something different oh oh yeah come on now listen if I say something out of the way you ain't you don't worry about it you have to they what your pastor says come on is that is that all right you're all right but notice the thing of it is people's looking for something different they're looking for are looking for that but the Bible says just contend for that same Faith people thinks the impossible things can't happen anymore but Brother Sam we're in an hour and age where we need those things in our lives we need to be able to overcome I preached on a message several months ago on overcoming and conquering brother Tim you remember that how many people can overcome this and overcome that and overcome but yet the thing is they don't conquer it if you don't conquer it that thing's coming back again amen you got to overcome it and Conquer it you got to see the impossible things that Satan makes looks impossible but yet by the word of God we bring it to possibilities amen notice now what I've come across on a lot of them where I speak they want a gospel with no outward emotions now I'll go ahead and let you I'll let you know I'm Pentecost from the inside to the outside I don't believe there's one mess that's a bad this a church Church of God a presbyterian Lutheran or anything in that Bible I believe every one of them is Pentecost and I don't mind telling you I've been preaching on that sack temple being restored I'm going to tell you when they came out of babon and came back up brother T you've been there with me then people was getting they were shouting crying holy Grace Grace coming unto it wow they were Pentecostal brother said they were holy rers so I am Pentecost come on my dad originally came out of Memorial Pentecostal Hol Church in ' 65 and built the church that I Pastor now and 3 years the uh the message come to him by tape trying to do God's service with that as will and then he takes it on and start preaching the message in' 68 the church contacts him and says you ain't going to preach this William Brown stuff and still call you True Vine Pentecostal because that's the original name of my church True Vine Pentecostal Oh no you're not going to preach this William Brown stuff we know him we've heard him about he done in the 40s 50s and 60s but we don't believe it and if you going to follow that nonsense you will change the name of church so he just went outside tuck the sign pushed it down put another sign up Live Tabernacle exactly they couldn't say nothing but on the true Deeds of my church and brother Tim we went back through the count the courts house on the true deed of my church it's called True Vine Pentecostal hold this church I told my church I thought I'm thinking about going back to that name True Vine Pentecostal Holiness Church why that's where it is in the vine amen right but they want something different brother Tim they want something that make you they want something that we don't need a settle down message man God we God sent a message that will not make a formal C Church oh a church with a gospel with no emotions brother tell you what brother B said he said if it made them act like it the way it did what about us with the Revelation that we've got you mean to tell me say we've got more Revelation today come on hold your t I said if I say something contrary to what Brother Sam preachers don't pay no attention to me come on cuz I get excited and I might say something y'all might disagree with that's fine come on the same time he said You Preach Liberty if you say something wrong he said I'll fix it later yeah you have you don't have to believe nothing I say but you got to believe what he said come on Amen right amen but notice they want something different I want you to watch this gospel the same gospel that Samson had this gospel that these great saints of God had they were different the word earnestly contend it means to strive to fight labor fervently right to contend with adversaries you mean to tell me brother Tim I'm going have to contend with adversaries you mean I'm going to have to fight the Bible call Jesus a uh calls the Lord a war a man of war why because it's constantly a battle it's constantly a war when you come into this message I just had a brother tell me the last week last Saturday night he said I'm fighting like I've never fought I said that proves you're doing something right amen amen amen so the message is to take us back hold on now the message is to take us back to the power of the book of Acts amen would you agree with that amen now look at the degree that these guys the that that that that we today and from this time look at the degree that we have fail from yeah compared to what they've got compared to what they had but Jude said we are to contend we are to strive we are to labor fervently we are to struggle with difficulties and dangers Endeavor with strenuous Zeal and strive for that same thingi exactly friends I'm telling you I've seen it work I know to work it means to conflict to race an assembly oh my to battle action listen just a few things what it says to to to be able to celebrate to observe hold in honor to consider to train to educate amen good glory to God bless that's the faith that these guys once had that's what they went through and Samson these great guys and characters Through the Bible they seen the impossible things made possible by the word that they believed amen you believe it now what is happening is Satan is trying to take the Faith from us to try to pull our faith from us but do not we have a right brother said we've got a god-given right come on exactly we've got a god-given right to see our children saved to see our loved ones right to see our people healed to see just just our our church to to come and labor fervently to try to build the congregation of the church up not in numbers so much but in the power and the word of God back to where it was brother Tim now we can't have that you know brother Brown's not here but the same God that was with him is the same God stand here it ain't a different God come on Amen oh my what a power what a faith that these God has Jud didn't say the scripture didn't say you didn't say oh we hope we can do it no sir no way oh my goodness man I sure hope we can get back to that no it said contend until you do get back there amen hallelujah oh my goodness oh brother Tim I don't know if we'll get there I've been laboring I've been fighting I've been battling but I I just don't know if I'm ever going to get there said you talking the devil's language oh my earnestly contend to go after it until you get it seems like if we don't see things happening Brother Sam in a few weeks then we ready to give up yeah I hear the prophet of God say the other day he said Abraham give God 25 years what I hear him say the other day I stand I stand SA and she begins to knit a booty a little socks and booty socks for the baby oh amen and all they had was one word from the Lord right all they had was one word from the Lord but Abraham he stood there saying it's going to happen and 25 years the Bible says go by right what thank you brother before it begins to happen too many people's ready to get up I hear brother say the other day he says people give up quit Church stay at home don't follow God no more he said what they don't realize the next thing that's happened is a Rapture oh my right oh he said they'll go church 20 and 30 and 40 years and get so aggravated because they don't see nothing happening the problem is they're looking for the wrong thing don't you realize church it's already happening amen glory don't you realize the I just read the scriptures and my mind's going a million places in scriptures quotes right now and if I get off of this I'm just going to preach what what I feel L to say but won't you realize brother man the Bible says in verse n there in Zechariah we was preaching on here a while back how that the glory of the second house would be greater than the first house and I told my church I said how is that possible come on how is the glory of God possible in the second house than it is the first you read Ezra and read Zechariah hag and see this how but the house didn't have the instruments it didn't have the furniture it didn't have none of the things that the first had right amen amen the Ark of the Covenant wasn't even in the second house so you tell me the Ark of the Covenant is where the word was where the strolls laid with his gold and its wing backed upon and the people and and the Levites towed on the shoulders it's not even there but the Bible says God looked down and said this house is greater than the first amen what made it Greater it couldn't been all the furniture the the The Omen po all there it wasn't there the lampstand wasn't there many of the things aon's robbed that budded it wasn't there but yet what made it glorious what made it more glorious than the first one it was the bodies that was there why God had come down in the presence of his people not just Furniture Hallelujah Oh Glory God wants somebody to put his word in he don't want it to be just on a Pew he don't want it to be just in Furniture he wants it in human beings HL you've got to be the one to contend for the faith you've got to be the one well I'll wait on Brother Sam to do it well I'm going to wait on so and so to do it I tell you what we'll just wait on sister so and so maybe she'll get excited the spirit of the Lord follow her you know she's a little Pentecostal anyway so we'll just watch her we to see if she gets it first yeah why thees sister so and so don't get it you've got to be the one to step up I've got to be the one to step up glory to God hallelujah hallelujah oh I hope it happens no it don't hope do you realize the word hope in the Bible actually means that you have confidence it will happen that's what the word hope in the Bible means to have confidence that what that word says will come to pass I will see the impossible made possible I will see this I can see this I don't hope I see it I know it's real I've stood in my church and preached this gospel for 15 years I've watched tumors on people's feet fall off in the floor while the preaching of the Gospel was going on why because because I preach brother Tim you've been there with me for 13 years I constantly preach this Faith you know why brother said he was out of town somebody died and they went to the City MO down there and they didn't call Brother B at this time and they went down there and raised the man from the dead come on somebody because said they have been taught to do that amen hallelujah you get these bunch of churches that believe it's another day right see I have no idea how y'all teach you believe do it brother Sam so see I can just preach cuz I don't have an agenda on no I call nobody and says what's legal to preach there I didn't do that nobody called me and said you need to preach on such and such they believe this right here and ain't right they they believe this but they don't believe this nobody called me and told me nothing so whatever I preached ain't nobody told me that's right am amen see that's why I don't call other people and say hey I'm going to so and so church tell me something I can preach give me tell me what they don't believe in that I believe in that I can get them with I don't do that amen amen I don't do that BL it notice this script let me get back to scripture look how far we've come since the prophet brother Bram went off the scene come on look at the the look how how many people has actually Brother Sam left this message why didn't they contend for the faith because they believe this nonsense the garbage hey I may never get to come back and preach here but I'm going to get it out one time they preach this garbage that these preachers crop up in their minds and people start looking for it brother Sam but when it don't happen exactly they're all tore of pieces because it didn't happen and they didn't see nothing they followed it for years and they seen this and they look for this and they look for this but then it don't happen and then they don't go back question that preacher uhuh yeah we just going to quit and give up we I've got many friends and that that guy right there does too we go back a long way and we've both got many friends that's quit this message in in the last couple of years and join methodists and Baptist and Presbyterian churches amen because they was looking for something that wasn't going to come to pass to begin with amen you got to preach this message right down the middle of the road friends you got to preach it and get to people to contend for the faith that that Prophet had he had it amen but here let me lay this on you he had it I believe he had it do you believe that but I want you to realize we've got to have something more than he had oh my go brother Tim hold it right there brother Tim I ain't going that way you brother Tim oh no you ain't going to T there and tell me we going to have something greater oh no brother Tim I ain't going there would you come on brother well stay back then Hebrews tells me that you and I have got to have something to get him out of the Grave [Applause] go tell me this second body tell me it ain't greater than the first exactly amen go on see where I'm from I'm labeled I don't believe the message no more cuz say I don't have a picture well I don't either we don't you'll be ashamed of yourself you ain't even in the message you ain't even in the message no more i t mine down cuz our screen comes down the back wall yes we had the Hopman head and brother random and you couldn't we have all this you couldn't see it so we just moved it and I don't have it in the church I have it out there in the Vue you know right and when I did that I became foolish virgin oh they preaching the other churches around my house I knew Tim didn't really believe his message oh my I knew he didn't have it when he took his picture down oh my what does a picture have to do with me believing this message I had somebody tell me the other day brother Tim was there and he he kind of snuck off and left me holding the bag cuz he knew what was happening he knew what was going on so he just kind of snuck out the door and left me standing there holding the bag and I didn't want to get into it with nobody but I found out they have a shrine oh yeah up there in their room and a shrine of this and the upside downn pyramid and the penny thing and the wax and this and all this y'all might have a shrine I don't know I want to know where that makes me a part of the message friends I was a part of the message before the foundation the world according to the Bible that's right I was a part of God before the foundation of the world is that what not scripture says your name was written in the book when not when you got saved not when you went to church but for the foundation of the world so me having a picture belt buckle a cup links all these things fishing rods I'm not against none of that stuff I'd like to have all of it too just to have it say God it's nice stuff to have but don't think that makes you a part of the message don't think those things put you in the Rapture it don't contending for the faith that these guys had that's what the real thing is Right Samson began to stand there Brother Sam and Samson seen a vision right oh glory and he come to the place where he knew he would have to he' have to come back listen but said I seen him go through and they came back here remember I'll read you a quote Samson stand there and done lost everything done become blind right says he knew he had to come back to where he had fallen from oh what did I do with that quote what did I do with it remember said all others appeared no more they went out never to come back he said but the bride came back because she was Alpha and Omega amen God the great sculptor had made him a masterpiece he said for it was a piece of his his first Masterpiece amen amen it was a piece of his first then if I'm a piece of his first Masterpiece then I can't be nothing else but that thank you look like he made in the Garden of Eden he took a piece from him and made another piece and that was Mar and fell now he's been all the time building it up again he brought forth this masterpiece that was smitten in order that part that was smitten was in order to bring back again another well then who is this other Masterpiece huh who is this other Masterpiece he's talking about one had to fall what glory to God I speaking T to scare half of your death come on so the Masterpiece and the Son of God the Masterpiece listen what he says and his bride amen God give Jesus to you and I as a gift yes sir H you taters we oh it's Christmas time now we know the gift you know the worlds call upon the gift yeah brother said do they see him in a Manger I just read Sunday night to brother Tim how brother said oh he said it's all he said we can see how they worship him in a Manger but we can't see how we're worshiping him in US Amen on seeing the impossible become possible over the Tim is not possible for me being part of that Masterpiece he's God he's Jehovah he's Elohim he MDC it's not possible for me to ever become that it is possible amen I just read today brother M said I was setting up the desk brother M said that there it is he said when he came he said that M that levitical priesthood died there he said because the original was M asess he said there is a masterpiece a Son of God he said that Masterpiece and the bride it's a piece of him which must be filling of the word the word has been fulfilled and we're ready now for the coming of the [Applause] Lord oh let me get back to Samson I love old Samson I love preaching on the bride too cuz I'm part of it Samson says oh I know it's possible I know it's possible to turn back to way I was what right he didn't seen the vision I know it's possible he's blind the Bible says but I know it's possible he said oh I see him standing there we'll say oh so this is Samson he said now catch a picture with me this Great Mighty Warrior let's picture him this afternoon that he had wide shoulders great framework he this big bulk of a man stands there blinded tied with little strings led to the middle of the floor humiliated broken defeated with the great God of heaven looking down upon him his critics drunken soldiers staring at him amen I imagine as they stood there many Philistines had even shooken their shoes to hear his name Samson oh don't say that around me right says oh many Philistines shook in their shoes to hear his name Samson what a mighty name one time so when Christianity now watch out brother bam take it from this this vicinity this era of time and brings it down oh I love how brother B take that story and that great that that great story there and he pull it and preach on it then we'll pull it down brother 10 where we at I tell my church if we can't take the message and preach it to our congregation and bring it down to us what good is the message oh brother Tim to preach it to another church and preaching to another church what good is it for us if we can't preach it to our church he said there he is brother said so was Christianity the church was he said now watch me parallel this this scene Samson's name people just fainted for he was some sort of a man that they' never seen a man like him his strength was beyond anything that the world had ever had there's nothing they had could match it many remembered him as they looked on him standing there in that great in that great condition amen no doubt here stand Samson at this time thank you brother Tim I'm done done far right oh Glory I'm done far right I'm done far I didn't they didn't found my strength I laid my head in lap of some woman I'm done for what amen I guess this the end of the road for me right and all he could do was look back at the things that he had done he killed this and he killed the lion and killed the bear and did all these great things and he he can remember back on his life what God done through it yeah brother Tim as he begin to look back on these great things that he done there caught the fox and tied her Tails together put them in the fields there burnt the fields and all these great things that God used him for and he stands there defeated the fles just tied him with twigs and they cut his hair and he's standing there defeated bless oh God oh God you did this for me I remember the line Lord I remember remember this and I remember that I remember all that you told me to do Lord and God why now right why now Lord why have I come to this this is my end and look at me Lord watch The Parallel many people come to that same place Brother Sam they follow the message all these years and they hear these great things of God and hear people talk about what's taking place in the heathens but maybe many of them never seen it take place and they get so so so down and so so un they're just discouraged amen oh if we're ever living in a discouraged time is now right everybody's looking for the economy has been bad since 08 we've got a president in there that don't know Joseph I'm not a politician preacher sir but look at the in the discouragement that we have in America everybody's tossing to and Flo everybody's running this way they don't know where to run but right here is the time we need God more than ever sir especially people that send this message has follow this message for years and for years and for years and they see and they they'll see God do a little minor thing and it'll just it'll just perk them up and all they'll they'll last another six months and God will do a little thing over here that you cannot look at those things right I know it's hard I was raised in this message I remember that where my fellowship Paul said used to be an old brush Harbor yeah come on I was a little baby at the time little boy young boy yeah and they tell me that the blind would come in that I got pictures of it they said that the blind would come in brother Tim and sister Carolyn you know her James's Mama she' come in she'd had a stroke on the right side left side of her body and they said she'd come in and God come down GL amen hallelujah amen so I was raised being taught to contend for the faith yes sir I've seen God heal many times but I've went for long periods of time where I didn't see God move it seemed like yes sir and you sat there and you beat your head against the wall when you satting at your dash and you hit the dead you say God what is it right Samuel had come Samson had come to this Place excuse me God you've been with me you've did this now God what what is [Applause] wrong oh I hear that prophet of God scream out he shuck his chest out and glared back he said oh just once more Lord hallelujah if we've ever needed just once more Lord is now brother par else Christianity he said Christianity he said was like Samson at one time I'm just using the terminology Christianity was like Samson at one time he said look how Mighty the church was look how mighty brother says the church was right we can read the stories of how how God come down through through the seven Church ages we go back and you know read all the church ages and excuse me see the the the the the the restoration of the gifts and all these things and the fifth Church age and Luther and Wesley come up and then the prophet of God come on the scene 1906 of Zeus Street California we can read that and see that how the power of God fell they worshiped so much they was contending for the faith they stood there in suusi Street California that day and in the month of April and they begin to have the power of God to fall upon them they begin to worship God in that little house on that street there and worship so much that the house fell off the foundation sir oh glorymen they moved from the house to the front porch and tore the front porch down worshiping God yes sir oh but brother Tim them days are gone that's because we want them gone right brother B said Christianity that was Christianity there he said that's how powerful the church was that's how Mighty the church was he said but Satan wanted to see the people Satan wanted to see the people lose their confidence lose their hope lose their Vision amen Bible says in Proverbs where there no vision there people perish see that's the thing that's happened to the Sal this 2013 going into 2014 in a few more hours people's lost a vision they've lost a vision that there's a real God they lost they lost a vision that God can still heal the sick they've lost a vision that God can still Save The Lost they've lost their Vision that God can still raise the dead okay they all every message Church in the World Turns against it brother B say it's truth the Bible says it's the word amen come on Satan will always show the people the impossible thing oh my amen he'll always show you brother the something that's impossible but he'll never show you the things that's possible he always wants you to see the negative part yes siren look how Mighty Samson is this lion comes up and jumps out on him oh my the Bible says it in such the order said the spirit of the Lord come on came on him and he killed the lion now let's just look at it come on church that's impossible sure you can't go around killing Lions not with your bare hands that's impossible but the possible part was it the spirit of the Lord Came Upon him amen amen human being can't do that but God can now to us to human beings we know we understand that is impossible but when God came that's what made it possible that's the whole thing don't do it upon yourself don't look for you to do it don't think you can do it don't think I can do it brother Sam you and I can't it's God amen amen glory go into the new year 2014 where I believe all things are possible to them that can't believe we got more dead churches in this message now I ever seen in my entire life I've been in some Churches I prayed to God to help me to shut my mouth to quit preaching to go home come on I'm telling you the truth I've been in some churches that is so dead that I was preaching pring praying God please tell me find a place to stop to go home I preached in some of them that when I got through my wife was crying like a baby begging me Tim please take me home I can't take this so I know I've been I preached in quite a few churches there's a lot of churches that don't believe the power of God no more they are laid back and they're waiting on brother Brown to come do it for them at all he's coming to back and he's going to do it farest you know the reason people do that church because they ain't got enough Holy Ghost himself to do it now keep in mind you talking of Samson this is the early church is not that the early church look what they're doing it isn't lions that we face today as Samson did right but look what it is that we face today look at the spirits look at the evil look at the the the the filth and the garbage that you and I every day face we get them go to jobs and go to to the market go to Walmart whatever we have to do on our daily duties look at what we face every day yes sir what Samson face really wasn't nothing compared to today oh brother Tim that was a real line man he had big furry head and all this and he had big paws man look at him no what Samson faced was nothing right compared to what you face oh brother Tim you taking away from Samson I'm not taking away from Samson the Bible says the spirit of the Lord Came Upon on them and he killed him right amen look at what you face every day but do but you don't know how you fight it how I got to fight it with the same Spirit he did it ain't a different Spirit glory to God that's where the people's missed it brother Sam they want to fight it the way they they want to find a way oh we're going to find a way our church teaches it you can't F the devil the way the church teaches you got to find the way the word teaches it amen that's why so many people falling by the wayside Brother Sam they're trying to find it their own way and find it way the preacher says here and the preacher shows them is the preacher shows them in and they won't get in the Bible and do the message and see for themselves what God did for them amen exctly I tell my church at home TOS of witness to it I tell my church if you don't go home and check me out something's wrong with you come on you don't go home and see if it Ain in the Bible in the message while I preach and you got problems on look at the early church there in the book of Acts the Bible says when the Holy Ghost had fully come and Peter then began to walk down the street and people the Bible says people begin to be healed Jesus The Impossible made possible right the Bible says the shadow of PE Peter just went over never laid hands on them come on Amen the Bible says the shadow of Peter come over them and they were healed oh but brother Tim that's Peter after all God did give him the keys to the kingdom and Tim that's you stay sick then I well I got where I tell church if they don't believe it stay sick then that's what I tell my church you don't believe it stay sick you want to go home sick go home sick you don't want to go home sick you don't have to go homesick that's right the shadow of Peter and the people got healed right amen but Sam you won't find more them boys went to prison there before they started doing the acts of God right the Bible says that begger was laying by the street Peter comes up and says s and go have we none but such as we have we give unto thee who give it to him Peter is that right then who's going to give it to people today come on Amen s go Have I None but such as I have I give unto thee amen then we find them next week after that the next week they put him in jail that's right amen because as long say the devil didn't mind them if they just went around but don't you do things like this the enemy didn't like it and when they started doing things like that out in the opening Satan rared his old hugly head that brother bam said and he had them throwed in prison same thing with you and I you think Satan cares you come to church and spend four high fires tonight n see all these empty pews Satan sitting in rest of them right well I can prove it by a quote so that's where he's at right well I thought he was in the beard joint well we go to beard joint for it he's already got them he's here trying to get you trying to get Meen he don't care how he don't come mind you come and sitting right here on his Pew he don't mind you getting a little excited hey man brother preach it brother glory to God brother preach it he don't mind that but when you become one with it when you begin to become one with what that word begins to say then he's going to say oh watch it now I can't have you doing that don't don't don't be this that and all of a sudden you'll get an idea I left the stove at home and my house is going to burn down oh I left the iron on the ironing board and this down and I gu oh oh my we ain't going to have a house no clothes we w't have nothing when we get home the devil did that because you was listening for the word exactly if you can take your focus off that's what he's doing to Samson Samson's come to the place where he's took his Focus Samson knew God done all them things for him Samson knew the word of the Lord came on him he knew the power of God laid in his hair he knew all those things he knew he was a Nazarite vow he knew who he was but when Satan got him to real life and take the focus off of who did that he stood there conquered right amen same thing we do amen same thing we do the Bible says when them boys walk by Brother Sam and the shadow H them the Bible says they listen closely the Bible says they recognized they had been with Jesus amen glory to God believe they recognize somebody had been with Jesus I'm telling you friends we're going to face things in 2014 we didn't face in 2013 you going to see things in 2014 you never thought you'd see happen you wait and see if the government can get you and I dependent on them they've got us that's right they've done got it where they got the world depending on them come on yeah right don't you ever do don't you fall without that trick you depend on God amen amen exactly right let's go a little further if I all right oh it's 9:30 it ain't late now watch the difference here the days prior when they recognized they was with Jesus the days prior of the book of Acts when Peter notice what Peter was doing now I'm we'll get back to Samson but watch the early church as we just go through this days prior Brother Sam of what Peter was doing in the book of Acts the B bble says he was running around cussing and was running around naked that's right now if we message people seen him today what would we' thought about Peter right amen about jingus you ain't coming back in my church read your Bible prior of this Peter was running around naked cussing brother Ram actually called him a cussing preacher that's right right amen right but see there's one difference he was doing that before he went in the upper [Laughter] room Lo but the whole time Brother Sam when he got mad and aggravated and started that he left Jesus goes down back down to the river to a boat and throws his clothes off and we cussing right amen but prior of that who's he walking with oh yeah Jesus right amen that's amen see that's about like all those today thans just because they walk with brother Brown they fine right Peter walked with Jesus and he was still unsaved on just because we walk with brother bandam don't mean nothing oh I could say some things but I'm not just because we walk we brother B that don't make us say because Peter and James and John and walk with Jesus look what they done you wouldn't catch me running down thr my close off cussing Peter did and it wasn't long after that we find in the shadow of him going over a man and healing him sir but one difference was the Bible said they recognized he been with Jesus listen friends they was with Jesus before the upper room experience amen right before they go in the upper room they've walked with him they've talked with him they was in some of the greatest convictions ever Jesus looks at Peter and says Peter Satan's desire to sift you yes sir amen that means w Peter Satan wants you but I'm not going to let him have you but I will let him sift you right that's what Jesus said go back go the original words of what Jesus said in the original see if he didn't say that but has he been with Jesus yes did it change him no what changed him when he went in the upper room and experience happen up there yes sir so there's a big difference in just being with Jesus and knowing Jesus right but see after Peter had actually come and he come to the knowledge of who Jesus was right then brother Tim he walks down the street and people says whoa whoa now he's different yeah last week he was this this week he was this because he know he walked with Jesus but now he had come to know the knowledge of who he was amen notice Samson now spiritual food and doe season blood says oh let us turn if you want to follow the message I follow the reading he said Mark it down he says now I don't believe it would be appropriate to have a service without reading God's word and passing a few comments if it's going to be a hidden service or any kind we all understand there's no strangers Among Us I suppose but we all understand what healing is nothing that somebody does for you it's what God has already done for you Samson's on the same line he said the only thing is to get the people to believe that the to believe that's the truth God teaches it in his word and then proves it to them who believe it for for for he said all things are possible in believe you say there's nothing impossible with God you believe that there's nothing impossible with you either thank you Lord right I Wonder Why They Don't Preach that part right here what he says there's nothing impossible with God he said do you believe that then there's nothing impossible with you either he said all things are impossible to them God is one person to them that believe so there's nothing impossible to you if you would just believe it that's it amen oh we don't teach that no more though oh I ain't talked about in the message no more huh that right that ain't talked about no more you know we can't do that man we take him from Brother brownon come on brother that's one one time he's talking about said uh he left my church cuz he believed to return called me over to go over everything with me and saids I want you to see what I got and look at all this he had a big old table there and they laid it all out it was hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of quotes and I said all right I said I see all of them I believe all these quotes yeah I said you got one scripture well well no I ain't got no scripture that's it right there them coaching doing me no good that's right Amen brother Brown says when I when the angel comes to me with a revelation I take it back to the word I said let me ask you a question I said you saying brother Rams coming back to do this and you got nothing can be done he said nothing can happen to brother ra comes back I said what do you even pray to be healed for then that's right right I said I say you pray pray for people to be healed when your kids are sick and all that what do you do that for right if you believe it let's believe it come on if you're going to believe that garbage believe it don't believe half of it come on brother listen the early church Samson brother B tapes the early church starting with Peter there and Paul he Taps that church from then all the way to our day he TPS the early church was Samson amen then brother Tim there must be some significant point that brother B was looking at in Samson's life well he's up the Old Testament brother Tim he don't really me it don't really mean much we're under the New Testament now brother bam typed the early church which was us he Ted it all the way through with Samson yes sir oh my god there they are sitting oh my goodness if you'll go in the Bible of Judges 16 I won't read it you can write it down and read it later you find there they are sitting the Bible talks about it brother Sam how they're sitting by the gate and they're waiting the Bible says they're waiting right for Samson to come at the gates because the Bible says they were going to kill him right judges 16 save time there're that that they've got their schem together they've waited they've seen how powerful Samson is they this is the they banded him all these things they know that God's with they know he's different they know there's something about him different and they and they look at him and they say let's wait for him out here we'll get all these on this side and all of these on this side and when he comes through the gate we'll just kill him right amen oh my but their stories changed when Samson walked out and picked up the gates they had no idea Samson going to pick the gates up they knew it was a mighty man but notice brother B of types Samson with the early church don't you see the importance of what Samson doing it's something that you and I must contend with Hallelujah exactly and they come out and Samson comes out and they got in there and they it's dark and everybody in the middle of night and they don't know Sam Samson they don't think Samson knows but the thing they was missing as God was with him he comes out and he begins to grab he goes up to the gate and the Bible says he GBS the gates and the post right he grabs the gates and the post and the bars and just picks them up out of the ground brother Tim that's impossible with me and you yes yes with me and you that's right but when the anointing the Bible says the anointing came down up oh there's the difference Brother Sam listen we come to church and said here and here four and five I could preach four and five in six hours that ain't worth the nickel unless the anointing comes right it don't matter how sat don't care if I preach all night if the anointing don't come it didn't do no good say Samson walked out but what they wern't figuring on is the anointing was upon it Satan don't mind you coming but what he don't figure on if you allow that anointing to get upon you right brother Tim ask for them gone back there why why do we believe that nonsense because the devil tells us that brother we don't have to be like that no more we don't have to be like brother mam said brother M said the church today he said back then they were Pentecost and they'll be Pentecost again now when I say Pentecost listen friends let me explain what I'm saying I'm not necessarily saying jumping shouting speaking running to pews and jumping the pews and Shing out hang swinging all I'm not talking about that I preached that at my house one time and everybody well Tim thinks everybody's got to be Pentecost like Kim jumping running sweating holling screaming holling snot Tim I didn't say that that's right they wasn't figuring on the anointing of God upon him they didn't think he could come out and pull the gates and pull the post and put the bars up amen oh but when they seen that brother Tim can you imagine their eyes other day oh god what have we got ourselves into because the difference was is when the anointing stood up on Samson it wasn't Samson no more and there's the thing you got to see church when it's not you when the anointing gets on you it's Goden says oh yes when they tried to fence in the power of God see what they done there they fence in the power of God well let's let's let's fence this one area here and leave the power of God I built the church I built several churches one time and in this in this church is the United House of Prayer for all people and uh I built this church and they had right here right here is a little place and they'd have about 50 foot right here what nothing but hardwood and this one area was shouting ground that's all it is you could not come in this area unless the spirit of God hit you oh I thought if we did that to a message church we never have to fix that floor because it never gets stepped on never be scarred up none because I'm going to tell you M's churches friends got where they won't worship they won't speak they won't speak in tongues no more they won't worship no more they won't cry no more they won't scream no more why because they've allowed these low down preachers to teach them that garbage you want to go back and see how the early Church in the B the Old Testament acted read the read as a read Ezra read nemiah read Zechariah and read Hagi and see how they acted right Amen brother bam called them the body of God oh brother Tim those in the old teston they're not the part of the body of God well I'm just tell what you prophecy right amen it's the same ano brother no never did change it's the same one from the Garden of Eden all way to the end but man said it just gets greater and greater and greater that's why we can honestly say friends this church this body today is greater than what they had in the early 40s and 50s and 60s brother Tim you doing away with brother Brown no I'm not listen to what brother Brown said brother Brown preached these things back there he spoke these things there why because he knew that going to be a people Brother Sam that would believe him brother B looked for the Rapture but he knew God was going to take him home oh preached his own funeral wings of a snow white dub he knew what was taking place the anointing was on him but he said you wait till them preachers them little young preachers come through he said let them break it down divide it up and feed it to the children of God he had done spoke and preached these things way back here in the 40s 50s and the early 60s 61 he start talking about bride time bride time sea time bride age bride age why because he's seen it gradually getting greater and greater Ander oh God he said there it is he said tried to fence in the power of God they found out that they couldn't do it Samson picked up those great big iron gates up that would have weighed tons walked up the hill if I'm not mistaken if you go back and look at the history the B it teaches in history that that Samson actually picked the gates picked the post and picked the bars and toted them up a hill not downhill but uphill for 12 miles that's impossible for me but but it ain't for God he said he picked up them Gates walked up on the hill with them and laid them down he said certainly nobody was going to take after him he said they knew better then what do you think 40 50 guys sitting here and he picks up the gates tons brother said that way tons and tons pick them up and start to him up thing 12 miles up a hill they're standing there looking says y'all go at him y' what y'all waiting on hurry up go shoot a bow at him you see if y'all can get him well if y'all can get him down I'll come help you that's way people you go first and I'll come help you amen they knew better friends but said when a man comes listen closely friends I'm not going to hold you much longer when a man comes in the anointing of the Holy Ghost and with the word of the Lord amen uhoh hold your ters now when a man comes in the anointing of the Holy Ghost with the word of the Lord with thus s the Lord do you mean to tell me brother Tim the body can have thus say the Lord I'm just telling you what he he said right the Bible says the spirit of the Lord Came Upon Samson the anointing of God Came Upon him when he came out of the city he comes up to the gates picks them out of the ground walks 12 miles up a hill and throws them down tell me how he did it an anointing right brother M says and when that anointing comes in the on the of the Holy Ghost at the word of the Lord with thus say the Lord you better he said you better have better sense than to try to attack that so brother bam is now paralleling then thus said the Lord the anointing of God paralleling with what Samson had and did right that's why brother B said that's why they didn't attack him friends you don't have to we don't have to have fear he says you better have better sense than try to attack them then cuz you'll find there's a hand of the Living God and it's a heavy hand so he Compares Brother Sam he actually compares the body of Christ today come on with Samson of the Old Testament yes so you don't you don't come against a man if the spirit of God is on him right they found themselves in trouble then will not we do the same thing on Satan and his demons can't stand they couldn't stand the early church remember I'm said that's why they can't stand you keep in mind church it's not you doing it it's God people think that was brother Brown doing it it wasn't I tell you a meeting where brother b stands on a pool pit having a heating line brother B says now wait a minute says you ministers said come up here he called four5 it might been 20 ministers come up he said line up across the platform these ministers standing there in the middle he said start lining up and he said line them through here he said I want to this is what your Prophet said he said I want to prove to you to the congregation to the people that's listening and watching he said that it isn't me what them return people quote that I he said it I want to prove to the people that it isn't me he said now you brothers when they come through the line lay hands on them and you pray for them brother stands there right exactly amen now you see why I'm not like well of course as long as God likes me that's all that matters to me there's character after character after character in the Bible that things had come to them that brother bandam actually ties and brings and parallels I love to watch how brother Brown parallels the early church down through the Old Testament into the New Testament there we find him coming up into Paul's age in Ephesus all the way through up through the church age and brother man begins to parall and and tie all of this and goes goes back excuse me to Samson he goes back to shamard amen oh yeah because what these what these Great Men of God had he said that the body of Christ is to be exactly like them amen well brother Tim the Holy Ghost hadn't come yet I understand the Holy Ghost wasn't like we have it today in the Old Testament but you tell you said brother they didn't have Grace well tell me why in the book of Zechariah they stood there the Bible says they stood there hollering crying shouting Grace Grace Grace amen that's the Bible right but what we want to preach today and believe that they didn't have no Grace that back there oh they was all under law they couldn't see that the sa restoration of the church Brother Sam wasn't wasn't dealing with so much of the law it was God was showing said it was actually a shadow of what was coming God was coming there was law all the way through there was law when Jesus was here he said I didn't come to do away with it I come to magnify I come to make it Greater and there STS the Old Testament with all its great furnish and everything and these old and the Bible says if you look back in history you'll find when they came out of Babylon there are 70 years out of bondage there was 42,3 60 came out close to 50,000 in all but around at 7,000 got mad and GR humbled and gried and complained and the Bible says they cried aloud and bewell in lamentation am because 42360 was crying and worshiping so loud that the Bible says they heard them a far off right prise God but these 7,000 was looking for the first temple right right amen they was of the return Ministry they couldn't see what God was doing in the second restoration right all they could look back and see what would God done under the first that's why the Bible says and when God cometh the Lord the Bible says the two prophets coming the Lord prophesied through them and said the second house is greater than the first that's what the Bible says in verse n right then they couldn't understand why God would even think that because all the furniture was in it all the great things Aaron's Rod was in it the the the everything that needed was in it but see God wasn't looking at the furniture in the second house he was looking at the person Hallelujah that's what made the second house greater not not the furniture come on oh my look tell that Arc of the Covenant in that first house it was so it couldn't touch the ground it couldn't touch the back of a cow it had to be on levite shoulders it remember one time brother Sam it fell and another man jumped over and picked it up and the Bible said he killed him it was so so proper and in order and the anointing of God but now God had moved from that into another dispensation amen yes sir Oh Glory to God hallelujah and now look friends and now here stood the second temple and God said it's greater than the first on then are not we supposed to be greater than the first exactly Amen brother parallels Brother Sam shamard Samson what was the other one Gideon all these great characters of The Bible brother man parallels them shows them through the early church and how we're supposed to contend for what they had on oh Church don't take it lightly because it's just the Old Testament not right it's the power of God he was the same power that stood in the Garden of Eden right now notice if you'll run that on back you'll find out that the watch the word earnestly contend earnestly contend which is actually one word yeah Oh Glory what notice notice what brother bam was doing in all the messages that was preaching and showing shamgar and Samson and all these great people of God trying to bring the body Body of Christ today up to where they was and Brother Sam they was thousands of years ago but look what those great people of God had power friends power was with these guys right amen where's our Zeal like that where's our passion like that where's our passion that will take us back to that amen I told my church many times brother Tim will confess to it my church ever gets cold and former I can find him another preacher I'm not preaching to a cold formal dead church I refuse to do it come on so far we've helded it together pretty good a't with him for 13 years bless why you got to preach that you got to show the people the the manifestation of the message right and then brother B will take us back and show us how it was V Vindicated back there yeah and then he brings it up brother Sam and shows us that it's Vindicated today even in his ministry said he Vindicated who the prophet was he Vindicated what he was saying but listen friends the Vindication didn't stop back there we are also Vindicated of the Lord as a body of Jesus Christ with the word that they had is the same word today amen yes sir what see what happened to Sam he compromised with the world laid his head in the lap of a woman right yes sir Sams and the Philistines are upon me and he jumps up and his locks are cut let me hurry but we see him standing when he says lead me to this the main post what they couldn't see Brother Sam when they put him in the lockup and Delila would comes daily to see him and he's on the grinding wheel and the Bible says he's pushing the grinding wheel around and around and around and his eyes are put out and he's blind but what they couldn't see a little bit of it hair grow and Samson could feel it cuz he doesn't seen a vision of coming back read watch said it said Samson had a vision of coming to back what he first had exactly and he'd go by another day and another week would go by another month maybe would go by whatever the time limit was and it was growing but see they thought they had him and they couldn't see it and then grow back because it was a Nazarite vow right and he said go get him let him lead me to he told the little son lead me to the pillars of the temple right right oh my God Bible say he screamed out just once more Lord yes sir what was he wanting friend don't you see what he was asking for let me feel that once more shouldn't that be what the body screaming for today we as a Church of Jesus Christ friends we should be screaming and shouting come quickly Lord Lord why don't you come quickly Lord come quickly look for it every moment of your life right amen I'm coming to a close he lost everything Brother Sam he lost everything said oh what he oh what must have went through through his mind right he says seeing what them Philistines standing there they knowed him he said when I've heard one reach over to another and say I remember the time he said Philistines was saying this to each other I remember a time when you would say Samson and everybody would run to rats like a hole he said I've heard the time you'd say a thousand men would be marching across the excuse me the desert and then say Samson's coming they drop their arms and run for sat as hard as they could amen one man right I'm tell you brother say I'm going tell you what's happened that gets old to the people oh yeah C it's four five 6,000 years old but me tell you God didn't allow this to happen for nothing God didn't allow this to happen just to keep it in the pages of the Bible when the very Bible says Paul says it shouldn't been read he said we don't want it to just be ink from pens up on paper right oh friends we can read that good in the New Testament we can especially these messages we can read that real good but what we don't do we don't go back to where we talking about what brother man paralleled from the Old Testament and see that Paul was talking about that also he said they'd run like rats in a hole he said I heard one time where you'd say a thousand men he said and Samson's coming they would run for safety he said but now look at him oh he's in a terrible condition he's bound oh because he compromised with a woman that's what he's done she stripped him of his power she kept trying to find where his strength laid she knowed he was a big man but they had big men too but this Delilah she was a real Jezebel she knowed how to work on him to woo him to her and say that he how she loved him but all the time she was trying to fish along where his strength laid and that's the same thing that Jezebel has done to the church yes sir there he is again paralleling that message right amen he said Jezebel's done the same thing to the church he's now remember if you read the brother Brown's messages he's where in 63 now brother Brown is the church the church the church now right after here brother Brown's going to fix to start calling her the body amen amen he go right into calling her the bride amen used to be the church but they wouldn't go with the word he said that's where you Pentecostals fail he said when the word come he said when the word come he said you failed to go with the word you stayed with what you had amen yes sir then Pentecostal come up from 1906 19 through 10 and the teens and the 20s and 30s preaching and the power of God was upon him but when that Prophet came and he was commissioned in 47 we find out excuse me what took place he said there's where you failed you failed to go with the word you stayed with what you had and let me tell you friends they stayed with what they had and it died it killed them am brother said Luther had rabbits and Wesley had rabbits he said God didn't promise US rabbits he promised a four course word sir he said there he that J Bell laid to the church he said she fished see she find out where strength laid he said and if it's the the strength in the word the word is God finally she found where the strength laid she took him down to n of Rome and shaved off his locks yeah right you see how brother Paraline that he saids now they've took what's left out of it taken taken them back to the World Council churches got their locks shaved again you know what sad Brother Sam these message churches has did that and had a message to tell them to do better they know better brother tell me to do that and they allowed these jelly back fish Prett to lead them the wrong way right sir amen yes sir he said he said they got their lock shaved again he said it's a constant shaving taking this out oh this one doesn't mean that the days of Miracles are P oh there's no such a thing as this or that and the other they found where their strength laid substituting baptism and handshakes and other things for the true unadulterated power of God Amen yes sir Glory listen this small one this word is God that was given to his church to to defeat the world and the devils and sicknesses to cast out devils and no denomination was given to the church on the word was give to the church that was her strength but they cut this away and cut that away and cut that away amen oh my let me find a place to stop a so much I preached about two months on this you can't preach that in one hour but did you realize friend what's taking place yeah Satan what I want you to see don't go into the year 2014 thinking it's over right well God didn't come in 213 you know who knows he he might not even come the Bible says in Matthew They delayed he delayed his coming look what they done right amen don't don't don't do that don't be as the early church today I'm talking about the early church as we know it in our time don't be as them be as this early church read Dan read Samuel Kings what David begin to do for the Lord theam goes back and parallels the body of Christ just hit it real quickly he goes back and parallels the body of Christ back to David that early church see but most people look at the early church brother Tim and they see the early church was just in our day they're not looking back to thisen Jud one says contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints that's right amen oh I like this Brother Sam they couldn't see it and Samson was going around and around and around and all they done was shaved it now yeah is that right Bible said they shaved his head cut his eyes out and put him in the dungeon he's going around and around brother Tim this is what I like brother M said actually he said there in the church ages he said they thought they killed it out he said they tried to burn it out snuff it out hang it out and do all these things he said but they couldn't amen he takes it back to sson he hear Samson going around and around and around and around that dungeon his hair is beginning to grow you know where they made their fatal mistake what they didn't kill the roots right they thought they didn't think just because they thought because they shaved it it wasn't coming back but they didn't kill the roots and when it started growing his strength was coming back because he was a Nazarite vow glory to God Amen that's why brother said they tried to kill it out burn it out snuff it out put Peter Peter said hang him upside down put John I think it was John was in bowl a hot ball and all couldn't burn it out of him but M said see they can't kill the roots he said sure down through the church ages we see it y'all see it where it got darker and darker and darker didn't get a little bit of light says God gave him the privilege to give a little bit of light then it shows the eighth little moon right there in his total darkness remember that right that little light that brother said God allowed him to put in the reason it did they couldn't kill the roots amen they were still Sons and Daughters of God on the Earth amen still Sons and Daughters of God on the earth do you love him oh my there's so much I tell you get started you want to preach the whole thing my it's just wonderful though it's just so good to to hear how God done these great people of God let me read you a couple little small quotes if you don't mind then we'll we we we I'll call Brother Sam back up brother M said the the word was given to the church to defeat the world I didn't read that let me just lay that into the side he say the great Victor that we can point back to the days gone by in the Reformation he said back in the days of ireneus St Martin Patrick and all those great though great he said when Luther came out protested the First Church Catholic Church there and the group followed him right come back organized behind him and John Wesley came out of angelism soon as Wes left there organized he said the early Pentecostal Church come out of denominations that was the cursed word to you so what he says he said but as a dog goes back to its vomits a s to its wall he said you've went right back to the things were born to defeat sir he goes right in this this is the same message just once more Lord he preached just once more Lord in another message called once more out of these two messages brother B points the body brother Tim and the church back to the early church and speaks of all of these things and I've got several more that I'm not even going to have time to read but he's pointing it back to what they had that's how much power them guys had back he says in you Pentecostals you went right back to the thing that you were born to defeat he said all that hurts my heart he said that hurts my heart even more than to think of the victory younger that deeon had over Samson I see what Jezebel's got over the church that's the reason that every strength and every fiber in my being I'm trying to protest that thing and call back that church to her place of repentance your mothers your fathers you're oued out of those denominations your organizations they come out of it protested it and here their children has turned right back around and went right back into the thing they' come out of if it ain't the same picture of Samson oh I got many I got many many many many many many many many more but I just don't have time friends don't go into the year 2014 thinking that it's over right now I know the world's about over we fix to going to Rapture I'm not talking about that I'm talking about don't go back in thinking that it's over well brother Tim ain't we ain't going to see God do nothing we let me tell you the best is left to come and he made me and you a part of the best that's left to come can you say Amen do you love him give the Lord a hand clap of praise tonight if you don't mind let's stand together all friends God's good friends don't don't don't don't don't allow the world and the enemy and the things of that nature you say well Brother Sam preaches the word I don't have no doubt that this man Don't Preach the word I preach the word I mean I go to a lot of churches that that really do preach the word some that don't some that do amen that's not what I'm talking about Satan brother said Satan don't care how much Holy Ghost you got well brother Tim I'm away from that thing I've got the holy ghost that ain't for me that ain't what brother B said right you're not exempt from it neither am I don't let the devil confuse you and try to tell you you don't need that and that's of that brother M said no he said you need to go back and see what the early church had that's what we need righten Sam is that true or not exactly amen friends don't don't let the devil fool you if you got if you if you need healing whatever you have your your family a kids whatever it is God's able to give it well Sam I've seen he

Tim he witnessed all this he's been with me for 13 to 14 years now and he backs it up is that right brother Tim it's not me friends it's Jesus Christ if you'll preach that word here honor it and I told that family I says don't you ever give me one bit of credit and they're telling everybody in Anderson that little preacher down there they don't even know my name that little man they call me other says that little man down there he's a little preacher a little young preacher I said man I'm glad you call me a little young preacher least you know I says I didn't do that I said God did they now they're saying they want to come visit my church amen but see you never know what God has in store God's given them another chance right it's all his anointing exactly and see now if I didn't believe in healing didn't believe these things brother Sam none of these things would work right brother Tim's had many miracles that happen in his life is that true brother Tim you know why he believes it he was raised in it he's been taught it right he believes it and stands behind it if you if you teach it and believe it and stand behind it friends it'll work exactly amen it'll work Brother Sam right I got 10 pictures of that brush Harbor meeting and people sitting in it and my daddy's up there preaching and he's laying hands on the sick and they said in that meeting I I know people that was there Elder people that was there when this happened in 60 64 5 and 6 is when this was happening and said in them meetings they have pictures they said the power of God was coming down and they said that Daddy was touching the eyes of these people and they were being healed left and right just like this in a brush Harbor meeting you know why because they taught it brother Brown said my church believes that because I taught it right amen if you'll believe it amen it'll work right when you go into 2014 in two hours from now two hours from now will be in a New Year Satan can't stand it but I'm going to tell you I'm not looking for it to get worse I'm looking for it to get better for me and the rde the world's going to get worser but with far as the body of Christ they getting greater yes sir friends please believe that whatever you do don't let the devil fool you I come to encourage you I mean I that's why I'm here I was asked to come and I'm I've come to encourage you I believe this message works I know that man believes this message Works do believe the word amen you believe with all your heart God bless you Saints be praying for me and brother Tim and my church and the different bodies of Christ around the world because I'm going to tell you I believe that we will see things this year that we'll never thought we would see right and I believe that's moving Us in to the closer to getting us out of here God's allowing these things to get us out of here you see old brother Tim it's so sad it's bad and it is brother BR said don't look at it that way he said look at what it's doing it's getting you and me ready the world can't see that cuz Brother Sam they ain't got a prophet to tell them that because they wouldn't recognize him we see it and believe it because we seen a prophet Vindicated and told us what would happen and see it happening right now prophecies are still coming forth amen I believe that friends and I tell you I'm looking forward for that body change ain't you one of these days but said you have a little funny feeding he said well you'll feel something he said you'll just step right into it well that's way over y brother Tim it's way out y know brother said I was 8 to 10 foot when I looked down and looked at my body right it ain't but just a few Feet Don't Let The Devil fool you friends you said brother Tim I've got the Holy Ghost friends I know too but I've been fool before I can show you quote at or quote quote or quote quot said just because you've got the Holy Ghost you're not exempt from the enemy he wants you more than he wants some people in these beard joints right down here don't don't don't don't fall for them you remember what brother Tim said tonight it ain't brother Tim it's the word of God what I've said come from the scripture in the quotes brother Tim that's all I need to preach you've been with me 14 years now that's all I know to preach right I don't have no agenda I want a body of Christ ready to go home and you know what Brother Sam this church and my church I can't go to y'all ready and y'all can't go to I'm ready as right brother you cannot make a body change to Life Tabernacle Anderson's ready and I can't go neither to spoken word here's ready so we're working together where y'all like me or not we're shoulder to shoulder do you believe it do you love him give the Lord a great hand clap of praise God bless you I love you Saints turn him around send him back up as way then there you go let's just sing if anybody has anything on your heart you you need to get rid of or whatever you need to do you need healing we believe it that's right they said to brother randam said we've got the power he said beg your pardon he said the power ain't come yet come on you want that quote he said the power ain't come yet he said like it's coming amen come on it's going to take a power to change these bodies amen amen oh of course you can go out there and smoke and chew in all ears and think he going to get you a new one but go right ahead that ain't in the Bible I want to see it it's this body changed that's right this body be made new that's right so then we don't have to worry about it do we let's sing just a song and then if anybody has a need the alt's open like I sing sing out love anybody have a need like I lift up my hands I lift up my hands to the singing you love him sing you [Music] sing do you anybody have a need sing it again unto him and think about him in moments like sing sing the love to Jesus [Music] in I up my can you do it I up to the Lord sing Love do you [Music] [Music] you love amen and amen and amen you make sure you tell our brother how much you appreciate it but we believe what he preached amen I don't believe that God died when the prophet died I believe the prophet had to die to where the power could come in the people because the people had their mind on him they had their eyes looking at to man instead of looking to the God so he had to get off the scene he said there can't be two of us here the same time come on you see it's rant word if you as he said about it you know lay out everything said give me the scripture that's what I was thinking about you know people believe we were taught all of our Lives we were going to get a new body I want scripture for it you said well I got just yeah but just remember Jesus raised and had nail prints in his hand did he get another body or was it the same body glorified see that the scriptures right we don't have to worry about it right okay all right you can be seated make sure you tell her brother how much you appreciate it and you know you will we'll get around just let them sing but we've got about an hour and a half now and we're going to just worship have a good time and just let the Lord lead us into what to to do and for the time and then we'll take the communion right on the stroke of midnight to finish up the year I'm really looking forward to next year amen amen I do every year I look forward because I know every minute I go that way way every second I go that's one second closer to seeing my master one second closer to change of these bodies one second closer to a Rapture amen go is right there in the word all we got to do is just keep walking you know and it's just one step at a time right don't try to run and do too much just walk along you we're not discouraged pred because we're here at all this time why because the word told us I stood right here in 1974 and you know it I said we can pass the year 2026 and not change brother bram's message nor the Bible but people don't want to hear that but I said it and I believe cuz everybody thinks brother Brandon made this prediction but he said I didn't do that he said you say what I said yep it's got to be over in 77 what everybody thought he didn't say that he said don't you say that I said that because see the word is true and it'll take care of the whole thing so I'm happy the father we go the more people will fall away amen right you know what that makes it where the scriptures right fear not little flock that's right amen that's right people will fall away but we don't have to who's got a song we want our brother I know he can sing because heard him we want him to come up and sing for us if you will let him be the first and then we'll be next to the song and

re and I maybe this is not the time to do it but I want to do it before we close out we have a man that plays with us at one of the nursing homes hold on just AE it's an elderly man that plays with us at the nursing homes and he's he the way we met him he had a stroke and was in there for rehab and then he came in to hear us one day and then uh he started coming back after he got well and left well he placed this harmonica never seen anything like it it's about that long about that big a round and it's got about six different keys in it on the harmonica and he bought it when he was in Germany it's very old the box it was in just torn up well he was at Eng Les the other day and he had to go to the bathroom real bad and he just got out of his car and ran into the drugstore when he came back somebody had taken the thing out of the front seat of his car he forgot to lock he literally cried this poor old man he goes around to Veterans and he plays for the veterans and anybody that he's just a good Christian old man and I told him about brother collie about how we prayed and the man brought brother col's gun back and I and you know I want I wanted I could see he was trying to believe that that could happen but he just couldn't quite grab hold of it you know so just pray that that H Monica will come back to that poor old man amen because it means so much to those elderly people that we go in and sing and play for him and he he's just he he even won a contest I think he won second or third place so he's pretty good so but he was trying to take these little bitty harmonicas and and sing play with them and it took a lot of time for him to switch Keys whereas the other one he could just roll it around so I know the Lord's going to bring that back I believe it sir sister sitting back here somebody sto her pocket book we pray it came back wor about it I believe it it's like the brother was saying all things are possible oh we yeah we believe all things are possible with God but the Bible says all things are possible to them that believe we know it will work with God but what about us who'll be next Who's got a song Testimony whatever come on come on up we didn't have to go through this the time you remember I was telling the brother Timothy about it while ago the time we announced we was going to just have testimony meeting and we going to have no preacher and watch not service and I said to everybody get a song you know I figured we'd have about three testimonies and somebody have to preach the rest of the night and we wound up and took communion at 1:30 in the morning everybody in the church children and all singing and worshiping and testimonies and never will forget one little one little black brother called brother Timothy all of them around here call me poppy you know whether it's black or white don't make no difference yellow or green and uh little boy he got up and he said I I want to thank poppy let me be let him be my poppy I wanted to thank [Music] him I just can't [Music] in the dark of the midnight have I of hid my face while the storm Halls above me and there's no Hiding Place M the crash of the Thunder precious Lord Hear My Cry keep

of your hand keep me safe till the storm passes [Music] by just keep me safe who'll be next come Brother Richard I just want to give a little testimony amen a lot of people may not understand this but I feel like Lord brought me from Egypt to the promised land amen and I'm glad to be here tonight when I first come here I didn't weigh but about 118 lbs and everybody thought I was on my deathbed but now I'm getting fat so yall just [Music] [Music] start over [Music] will you finally make your interest to that city of Jasper walls and bright golden and new behold all is Beauty and his [Music] Splendor remember there's just one request I make of you look for me for I will be there [Music] to I realize when you arise there'll be so much to do after you been in there 10,000 years a million maybe to just look for me for I will be there [Music] too as you go down your list of first there's no [Music] question you want to see your loved ones waiting there for [Music] you and when you feel you shared your story with the last one that wants to hear you tell just how you made it through just look for me for I will be there too [Music] I realize when you all right there'll be so much to

Glory Hallelujah yeah look for me cuz I'll be there too got all plans to be there who'll be next the brother Marlo he don't even know all the story I never told him when he weighed about 100 lb or a little more he was sitting out in front of a church in a wheelchair wrapped up in a blanket I thought Lord I got to go lay hands on that man but how am I going to do it cuz he went to another church you know how feelings are I never told nobody I just kept walking around till I got a change laid the hands on it I never told him that see he's here with us now might healthy cuz we believe brother Timothy I believe this Prophet brought the message amen who's next who's supposed to sing come on you see what the difference is this is my wife's favorite saying it wasn't the spirit wasn't took away in the ages that's where people are wrong it wasn't the holy spirit that was took away in the age you can't take the Holy Spirit the prophet said it was the Holy Ghost in every age it was the word that was took away we see with the restoration of the word comes what restoration of power so why can't we expect to see healings and signs and what come on brother why can't we expect to see it I I feel bad if I lay my hands on you or speak to you and you know and you're not well that's when I feel bad cuz I know it's real goe I'm going to try this see I tell you what let me I'm going to testimony while he try while we're getting that together uh you know it's it's it's something to be able to stand here having said it so many times standing literally at the bottom of a lake for for much as we can figure six or seven minutes or maybe a little longer I don't know exactly how long it was but I I noticed something the Pastor said the minister said earlier before I got there I had what I needed to get out of there and that was the that's the main thing in in uh in the my experience with Christ is by his grace and mercy he's always been there before I got to in the situation so that's the reason I'm going try to sing this little song here I don't know it's going wait let's try I'm two [Music] above all powers above all Kings above all nature and all created things above all wisdom and all the ways of man you were here before the world [Music] began Above All kingom Above All Thrones above all wonders the world has ever known above all wealth and Treasures of the [Music]

sing 2013 has been a challenging year but in all in all I have to say thank you to every one of you here and the ones who are not here um for your prayers your support phone calls when it came in when it was needed the most and I believe that is what this bride is about we have to be let's say one mind and one Accord help each other out and I do appreciate that um I just want to brag I'm a little girl a little bit she's been um reading a lot more amen listening to brother Brandon messages without me even telling her to go listen to one and I just want to ask you one favor for 2014 to pray us

mother and father sent to America to get rid away from the message because they didn't want her to get into the message centered with the Methodist missionaries live with them she got a job went to work lady right side of her was in the message God knows how to work it all out I'm going to give a testimon I'll ask the boys to come help me sing guess yall can hear me eat microphone okay okay and sometimes I don't say a lot but um the Lord's been keeps putting things on my heart you know so I can talk and um I just want to say a few things of things that have happened um um to me and I thank God um for for his grace and mercy one time um the the the day that brother Ryan and sister Gabby came I know they're not here today we I was driving up the road and something said to me you could have to find somewhere to sit I'm like no I don't it's not Wednesday sister you know brother Ryan and sister Gabby they come on Wednesdays and they sit they used to sit back there where we used to sit I'm like it's not Wednesday it's Sunday and I just forgot about it when I came to church they were sitting right there and I had to find somewhere to sit and some of those things I mean that was just something that's been on my heart for a long time to testify about but sometimes I look at myself like real small and you know nothing but the Lord I think he shows me things so he knows you know so I know that he is there for me and I have no doubt in my mind that the lord loves me and he guides me and if I had known what 2013 was going to be I was going to I said Lord wait a minute let me get ready but he led me through the whole year and one of the things even though it's hard for me but it's easy for me to do at the same time is tithing and um in February this past year I had believe it or not I had more money this one week in my account than I had given the whole year and I cannot tell you how it happened I cannot tell you where the money came from but I I just said Lord what are you doing and I believe he was doing it to show me you know and not necessarily just you know to do but it it just something that was like a confirmation for me something that was secret to say and I said well Lord where's all this coming from but it just so happened that the whole amount it was more than I had given I said Lord I don't know what you're doing but it just was some confirmation to me that even though like I say it's hard but it's easy it is something that the Lord really um you know guides Us in and you know like tell like I tell people I'm not intelligent by any means of the imagination but the Lord has guided us and really led us um through our lives and one of the biggest things that happened to me this year was in May and brother Dale was preaching on marriage and divorce and sometimes you know I mean whether you know it or not sometimes that's a series that really touches me because it's personal to me and I always try to say okay the end of it you know just hold yourself together hold yourself together don't break down but then he was preaching one time and he was talking about how that uh divorce was not blasphemy and when he said he probably say that a lot of times you know it's not a good thing and all that and I'm just in my situation because I'm in a situation but when he say that it's like something just lifted I mean I just felt so free and I said he better not say that again cuz I want to jump up and shout and then he said the second time I said oh Lord you want not say that and he said the third time I just clapped I mean people probably don't remember it but I just felt so free and so able to receive what God has for me in his word because I felt like I was a denomination in myself and I had bound myself and I couldn't receive the word from the Lord and I couldn't receive His blessings because I had put myself in this cage about you know who I was and what I had become but the Lord when he said that I mean it's like you know he talks about the 49th and to me I was going that helped me going to my 50th I mean spiritually emotionally I mean financially because the Lord just opened that for me and you may not see it but Lord is changing me and he's strengthening me in my personality and in just in my walk with him and sometimes when I come up I say Lord I just want you to meet me in your word and you know like the brother was saying some the devil just shows you all the negative but there's so much impossible that God does all the time and um even last past Sunday it was like when Brother D was preaching about that the seed and the word to me it was like you know when God um you know evaporates all that water it's like was such a big message because every Sunday I'm coming here to listen to the foolishness of the preaching of the word so he can let me free you know so I really but like you was saying that you have to be ready because it's just not the word it's the spirit in life just being taught Tau thought but you have to you know have that to meet that word as well and I I'm not explaining it right but that's just what the Lord has been showing to me because even though in my pain in my hardship I mean the Lord if he's there it's just so much lighter and I know it's very confusing it's like a paradox that even though it's hard and painful it's joyful at the same time because I see that word and then my brother so many things have happened I'm just going to just a little bit more when brother um Bob and brother Aaron were preaching I think end of October and brother Bob was talking about cuz um we've been looking for a place to stay for about a year now and you know we've looked everywhere and you know trying to consolid day with the family and then brother Bob was saying that um he said uh he laid on his face for two weeks asking God for a place to stay and then I said to myself Lord if you could do it for brother Bob you can do it for me and then I mean I'm telling you that week and we had we had had a rough rough weekend I we had we had come to the depth of the depths but then that week I was um Friday I think was Friday and I was working from home and I was listening to music but sometimes the devil get you into I just bought that you just have to have something on just to you know get your mind off things and I was just picked up the paper and I opened the sports page and I never never read the sports page there's nothing for me to read I don't understand it and there was this house there was this house for sale uh for by owner and then I called her oh can I come see you you know we talked and she she you know she showed me her house and everything and just to cut a long story short the Lord just worked everything out so much that even though we wenten the real estate agent the loan officer said oh no they won't take the offer the real estate agent said they won't take the offer but she the seller herself said she told her husband she said you know what the Lord is in this leave it alone and everything I've never been through such a smooth closing I mean I've never and I believe the Lord has done this and he's the one who's going to provide because I mean it just it's like I was walking in this in this in this Faith I've never really been able to experience that but I was just walking in faith you know things were hard and everything but I was just walking in this realm of Faith ever since he had said that and there was something else that brother Erin had brought out about going through the same Mountain you know going around and around sometimes they probably don't even know they say that and then the lord gave me some Backbone in a certain situation and I know I've shared with some of them and I believe uh I think I had to come to that on my own to stop that going around the mountain I had to you know like the brother saying he does it but you have to be in a place that he can do it in you but he's doing it and I really thank the Lord for you know strengthening me and continuing to give me a backb and you know maybe it takes long long time or telling the kids I've been coming up for 20 years but maybe it does take that long it does take you know continually hearing the message continually you know just just sitting under it and so you can come to a place so you can be ready so you can get rid of your own denominational ideas and I just wanted to thank my pastor because one time I was reading in second Timothy 2 uh chapter 2: 24 and it said the servant and the servant of the Lord Lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves if God pervent will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth in that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will and I see myself around those persons that oppose themselves and you know sometimes I do things you know people will shake their heads at me at all the time but I believe you know even brother Dale probably does some he doesn't say but he's patient and a lot of people cuz I am hard-headed and I am stubborn but I believe brother Dale is put in my path even though sometimes I try to oppose myself he comes so that you know I may recover myself at the snare of the devil and I just keep praying that the Lord give me more wisdom and give me you know the strength to carry on for the 2014 and you know raise my children and be a witness to others in my my workplace and a lot of places and I just thank him for that so Bo come we're just going to sing a little song but I had to testify and just get that also because I don't talk a lot and I really want to thank sister Johnny too for for being on the phone for me and showing me different way we just want say and you'll sing with us um cuz you know it's a song Everybody sings don't come come [Music] to give us so many blessings Ander that's what we are we are

thankful for I was thinking about what I should say tonight and the first thing I want to say is I thank God that I'm not outside tonight amen last last year when brother Jason was here preaching I got to hear him through that wall there cuz I was working on the heat yeah so I thank the Lord I got to be inside tonight so we thank the Lord we thank the Lord the the Heat's working I think it is anyway appreciate appreciate that also want to say appreciate brother Tim for singing that song tonight I got to hear him sing I I love that song you cries of awoken the master that's a beautiful song and appreciate him I was when when I come in this this afternoon I told him I said if you sing tonight you you can sing that song he did but uh last year this time just you know it just got laid off and I didn't know what I was going to do and you know it's been a struggle but you know the Lord takes care of us and you know just just how everything worked out that you know I went I was looking for a job and everybody said well it really didn't have anything to the first of the year and but God sent me to a employment agency and a friend of mine's wife works in the employment agency and she saw me and I was telling her about what had happened and she told me she said don't worry I'll find you a job and it wasn't just a few weeks later I was working and you know I wasn't doing what I wanted to be doing but I was working and you know it wasn't long you know I I look back at it and I know why God worked it the way it where it was that I was in a different department because now it's really beneficial because I know a lot of people in the plant I know what's going on and you know that it's really nice to have a rapport with people and you know like my dad's always has always said about me I've never met a stranger and you know I could talk to a fence post for half an hour before I realized he didn't talk back y'all act like y'all believe that amen amens get a lot of amens now but you know you know just I thank God for what he done because you know people are still amazed that so many people have appli applied for maintenance ahe to me but you know you know going through all of that you know a lot of people are amazed they they applied for maintenance they couldn't get that job they couldn't get in but you know I went in one week I went through the whole process and was in maintenance and you know it just so amazing that as that's what I wanted and God said he give the desires of our heart amen and going through where you're struggling and and now I've got a job that I I love my job I love the people I work with and we have a little joke at work that I said I got a full-time job and a part-time job and it's all in the same plant I don't have to go anywhere else you know I still people ask me how many hours I work and I said well my boss my our supervisor told me he said long as you don't plan on coming in here working 12 hours a day seven days a week overtime is not a problem lots of times we want to go home and we can't but I thank God for a job where you you're struggling and all of a sudden he said he'd open up the windows of Heaven pour out a blessing you couldn't contain a lot of people want you know you talk to people they want they want something but they don't want to work for it they just want God to give them something well God gave me a job so now I can work for it and so I thank God for that and you know I thank God for my church family and uh I just want to say I feel closer to each one of you to today than I ever have before I think the Lord just draws us closer and y'all mean more to me now than you ever have and I appreciate him I appreciate our pastor somebody that has has to get on to you sometimes but you know what he does it in love and you know you know brother BR says always pray for your pastor right right amen I wouldn't want to be in his shoes for all the money in the world but I'm so glad that he's called somebody to do that you know he always said you know brother D always told told the story about God always sent all the the hard-headed people he was like an old army Sergeant you know sent all the the worst bunch to him oh Lord I didn't think I was that bad but the Lord knows what you need so I appreciate him tonight I'm going to be in the key F we're going this is for brother brother Anderson what one night upon the scene a ship was tosing to and fro Breakers dashed on every [Music] hand angry winds around it blow all on board were filled with FES as the mighty Billows roll then they called upon on the wall through the winds and waves control when he reaches out his hand phow ceas at his command winds and waves obey his will when he says to them be still what man is this the all

days of old as upon I've see you [Music] say trust in him who never fails and I'm so glad he SS with me he's the master of the sea yes when he reaches out his hand the bow CE at his command winds and waves obey his [Applause] will when he says to them be still what man is this they all did say let the winds and see away he's a one who saes with me he's the master of the yes he's the one who SS with me he's the master of the [Music] [Applause] SE oh you got something you want to say too huh okay get these uh everybody's watching tonight so they're calling pleas this is what it says it says Anna this is Mary I'm watching Church online and I was hoping that you'd give word to Terren from me and Micah I love you I love you too no it keeps going I'm sorry it just says I love you all my little church family miss you so much I hope you get the message before church gets out look right over there there you go that's your mom and dad right there yeah all over the country can do it man who'll be next can I these people I deal with I don't know how many might be watching tonight but you know if if they are it's it's God doing it and I just hope and pray that they tun in tonight amen they not messing people amen more I want to give more of a testimony than I'm saying but uh today I was talking to a friend of mine and I was telling her you know how that I came to this message you know and I said well you know know working now and brother Dell and some other people were having a service I told I said you know I just accidentally bumped into brother Dale then I thought you know I didn't actually bump into him that God is in God's plan that I meet him and we became together you know and as we worked he worked downstairs and I worked upstairs and a lots of time he had a lots of free time where he could leave his job and come up and talk with me and tell me more about the word of God and so that's how that's how I came in I'm not going all through all of it take too much too long one other thing I want to say I want to say about the gun that I had that got stolen I was telling my neighbor that my gun had got stolen so they said well uh this man called me and told me said well I have the gun I know where it is and it I promis the person that got it if you won't turn him to the police that I bring it back to you so I said well bring on back I won't I won't prosecute him I won't try to find out who he was or how that he stole it but he brought it back you know but this all the same time everybody was praying so God were working on those people that had the gun at the same time we were praying so he brought it back you know and it's it's a great thing that God does things for us that we don't realize that he's doing if we just ask and keep believing he'll bring that to us that's right and one other thing I want to say this year it's been a a good year and a bad year but one thing I thought about of all the things that I've had people to steal from me lie to me you know do different things but I been the scripture I was reading I want to read just a verse in a minute but you know I learn through this year is to not hate people for what they done to me that's right not feel bad about people not to feel angry towards them them because Jesus Christ didn't do that way and if we if we follow Jesus Christ then we got the same thing that he had he loved those that hated him those that persecuted him and so that's the way we supposed to be we supposed to continue to love so I don't have I I learned that this year I shouldn't hate anybody it's not up to me how people feel about me but it's up to me how I feel about them and I I just thank God for that love let he let me see so I just want to read this verse from St Matthew the 5th chapter uh the father first verse verse but it says but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you and so I I just thank God for the love that he gave amen thank the Lord who'll be next he's got a song or whatever about singing Justified when you get okay ter will get to if I y'all y'all keep talking about all this stuff coming back so I had to say this um for the glory of the Lord um back in July I'll be quick um back in July hope and I went to Savannah vacation so that Sunday morning we went by Brother Jason Watkins Church um for Sunday morning service well y'all all know how I am capable of losing things well I got home and I had no Bible so I just knew I'd left it at that church I mean I was you know I knew I had well but Danny says are you sure you left it there I said well yeah I did but you know I stopped several places on the way home and all like that so I really I wanted my Bible though and of course you know I keep things forever so it's an old dilapidated Bible with a lot of stuff in it but um so we knew somebody there so you know hope called and he was going to be at church on Wednesday night this guy from Johnson City and so I knew that could get to me through Isaac so they called him and he looked on Wednesday night he knew where was sitting my the Bible wasn't there um so and the I happen to know the lady that cleans the church so hope talked to her daughter and she says well when I clean the church I'm sure I'll find it well still didn't find the Bible I still felt like the Bible was there but several months go on and when and so I started Mother's Bible and things would go on you know in church and I'd want to write it down and I finally started writing her Bible cuz I thought my Bible wasn't coming back you know I really felt you know as much go on and so then Wednesday night when Wade preached a couple weeks ago he said something I go I got to listen to the tape now to remember what it was I can't remember because I thought Lord I've got to have my Bible to write that in my Bible I've got to have it so see you know all along I had to claim it because then I was thinking in church of course you know I was guilty I thought now Jacob's going to Charleston tomorrow my son he's going to Charleston so I could get sister Anita to meet him on the on the interstate and give me get my Bible to me though I haven't talked to her and they haven't sent me my Bible or nothing they knew I was looking for it so then I thought well no I won't do that then I said well I've got the the number for FedEx I'll just call FedEx and I'll just mail them a package and they can send my Bible back so then you know it's Christmas so then the next night I come up through the garage into the house and hope comes through the front door and she says here's a package is it mine and I says I ordered her something from Amazon and I thought oh I've collected twice I've ordered cuz that came the day before so I says no that is not yours give it here so I open it up and thank God it's my Bible and I was so thankful and see that was just on Wednesday night that I had really claimed it and so the Bible was already on the way so I think the Lord it was a great Christmas present we brother MO wrote a pastor here to his other brother that and I started to work together he wrote a song years ago and it's really a beautiful okay we'll be next we got a few minutes Somebody Come and sing and she can find it anybody come on here 260 we lost

I'm like our brother said this will be a horrible year there a lot of things go wrong this year got to can't keep going just world's wore out but yet it'll be the most wonderful year of the bride of Christ yes sir because it's a promise a promise to us that we're going to take a Rapture yeah come on excuse me I was getting a signal before look for you but I couldn't read it I just want to thank everybody for all the prayers for Don and I this year um we got our house that we've been wanting for three years uh we climbed it uh we looked at a lot of houses we were fixing to settle for another house and decided to call on the one that we've been looking at for 3 years and ended up getting it we lost Tyler this year he moved away but I claim him he's coming back that's right and our rest of our kids are coming too if it takes three years y'all going to be here for three more years CU Tyler's coming back and uh I just thank all of you for your prayers for him and um our business has struggled this year real bad um thanks for all the prayers about that and um I'm claiming that too that that's turning around uh 2014 is going to be a better year for us in every aspect and uh we just need more word and and more prayers and thank you it has been a good year and it has been a hard year for a lot but what is what is problems and heartaches to a Christian they're stepping stones for things to carry us on if everything went smooth we would comeo Bratz that's right you know and but he's training us he's getting us ready amen Prophet made a statement one day that was outstanding to me he said this bride is going to be tried to prove that she won't fall like Eve well to be tried you got to go through a lot of troubles and heartaches and problems and things for trials but see he's building a nature a character in his people that can stand the pressure when all these things we've talked about the testimonies and the witnesses and all all of going through and all like that it's Stepping Stones just to get us ready to be able to just stand whatever comes if it comes you know and the worst thing that I see now and I'm not throwing no Stones just just me I'm that old sergeant that brother was talking about while ago the story was to brother Timothy them I told him one day I said you know in the military you you you get an old tough Sergeant you hate his guts he works you to death runs you to death this one brother told me about his was so tough with his it that he just spit in his face and stick his throw him down in the mud and just stand on him and press his nose in the dirt I said yeah but when you came back from Vietnam you order looked that guy up and said thank you because you survived because of him well old tough Sergeant sometimes has to be rough but just remember we're trying to make soldiers out of people instead of being sissified little you know kids but it's a great year it's a great time I'm glad all of the tops the Shadows the predictions that we went through all these years I'm glad all of that's just about faded out you know now the church can get down to the bride to the worse you can just sit down and believe what the prophet said and that way then you can just walk right on we believe the message but we're not looking for the resurrection of the Prophet I am because I believe and he can be the first in the resurrection that's fine you know that's okay okay but I'm looking for a bride to become the word yes and you say well it'll just be something happened and we'll just speak it you can't when I first came into the message there were a lot of people saying that that one day we'll speak the word I said yeah but there's only one problem you got to get it first what do you mean I got it well why hasn't It produced as brother Brown said about it I was bringing out there Sunday he said why hasn't your Reigns brought Christ to the church he said you SED denominational Reigns spoken word Original Seed you s denominational Reigns he said that's but said the word is sown pure and unadulterated right so we don't have to correct the message you don't have to do nothing that's right and like I've always said I know I'm hard when I say things but if you can correct the prophet then pull off your shoe I want to kiss that toe CU you are almighty God because that's the prophet stands before nobody that's right but God alone nobody could tell him that the white horse rider was the Antichrist Clarence Larin taught it way before brother brandham ever come along but it didn't do no good but one day the Lord opened his eyes didn't he and showed him that white horse rider was the Antichrist wouldn't the Holy Ghost the the prophet stands before God arguing dates and times and things why don't you just get out and forget it and run on and leave the message alone you know but yet see people don't want to do that they want to stay in and cause trouble and that's what this year has been the worst year of people attacking the prophet his dates his times his wordings his thing will you think it's not going to get worse this year that we're in now it's going to get worse and worse and worse but the bride is going to be ready and she's going to stand the test we're in the new year so let's just stand together have to get my Bible being in a new year a new time we take the communion and we just then Fellowship together for a little time in this new year while the world is screaming and hollering you know but we just have a good time in the Lord right Paul in Corinthians 11 says for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus and the that Lord Jesus same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had SED saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me or as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do you the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself what not discerning the Lord's body for this caused many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged now I love this scripture this is one of my favorite scriptures but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world that ought to ring into your heart and you think about it that he will not let me go wrong he will judge me and chasen me and keep me straight amen cuz he's not going to lose me he's got too much invested in his little bride a he wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat toay one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come let's just have a few moments in this new year of prayer silently praying praying for one another praying for the pastors praying for the people that lead us and guide us because you know contrary to seemingly what people believe pastors have to have pastors you know I never didn't know where the Prophet said that they didn't need nobody else we have to have each other and we have to believe it so let's just pray right we thank you Lord for this day and this time a new day and Lord as you said there in the scripture one day said tighten up CU we ain't been this way before but yet we know somebody that has walked this way you walked it before us so all we got to do is find your Footprints and just walk in them Lord and everything will be all right so you lead us whatever this year brings you make us to be happy and joyous no matter what goes wrong all is well because you said so we love you and we thank you father in Jesus name that we say to them what there W them's watching happy New Year you'll get to it in a little while and you can have yours we have ours father we thank you for this bread it's been made for this purpose tonight Lord we know that it's not your body but it represents your body we know that as we partake of the bread then we're partaking of the word of the hour that we're living because that's the main bread because you said you was the bread of life you said your word was spirit and in life yes it's not just letters on the page but you are in the Living God we love you and we thank you we ask you to sanctify the bread and the partakers in Jesus name we never take communion that we don't think about the children of Israel and coming down to the end and getting ready to leave out of Egypt you know what's the last thing was took communion that was the last thing cuz they had the the supper and then in that supper part they had a little part that a lot of people hadn't thought about but they had a little part in that but they took the wine and the bread and they went through the things and Jesus when he came and picked it up he just simply explained it Paul taking the Old Testament bring it down he explained it what they might not have known exactly what they were doing but yet they were getting ready for you and I and then what about it what about coming down to the end in a Rapture going to the wedding supper what's it going to be communion a't going to be being Anders going be the communion we're going to take the communion but it'll be a happy day Prophet said when it comes to that time would you look across the table and you see those that was with you be a wonderful day won't it father we thank you for this wine has went through the process now Lord It's better every day because it represents your blood that was shed for each one of us and Lord as we eat this little piece of bread that's a symbol of your body we drink this little wine tomorrow in our body There Will Be Blood cells created because of this and as it is we will truly become one with what we're doing Lord we thank you sanctify the people and sanctify the wine in Jesus Jesus name come morning I walk by the riv I'll rest need the Ever Green Tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes I'm despise and rejected and I question oh Father how long then I take one more look at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to go on right come morning I walk by the river a new day I rest me yeah there's always a new word for every day not another message we could stay around here 10,000 years and we'd still be getting more from this message and we don't have to worry about it it's not something new it's back to the original as our brother said earnestly contending for the faith yes sir that was once delivered but it will be delivered again sir yes and I believe the prophet brought the message but you know what it's got to be revealed to you and I as I was preaching to you Sunday yes all you can do a preacher can do is seow a germ that's right we say we go sewing and Seed you can't sew seed folks you s a [Music] germ a germed then watered becomes a seed you can preach all day long won't do any good but if there's one person there and that Holy Spirit can drop down and Quicken what you've said now you got a seed it can come alive Happy New Year we take the communion man make sure you tell brother Timothy how much you appreciate it we believe the message believe what he was saying we're earnestly contending for the faith you don't hear a lot preached now among the people of the message or the faith of the fathers they're so revelated they're all up and gone you know and I can't I'm not no making no out of nobody but a lot of people are too Heavenly minded to be of any Earthly good you know I think we're still here but yet the word is unfolding and it'll be that word that'll change you and I am it's already been spoken I told you there's things that had to be said when that Prophet when I was listening to that Rapture message ain't no Rapture in the Bible you said yeah there is Enoch no no he's translated different things happen word rapture is not in the scriptures right but you see the prophet coming he said it has been spoken now let it come to pass I believe if he hadn't said that there wasn't going to be no Rapture in this end time that's how much dependence I have upon the message is it's going to be this message that'll change us then you know what this message is going to Israel through them two witnesses Ur this message brought over to Israel go when you see a book about the seventh seal and read it said them two prophets will say you me best the opportunity to be the bride we said these Gentiles has received it now
