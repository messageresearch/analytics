[1:41] blessing and the blessing that I'm
[1:45] looking for
[1:45] when I come to church is a change I want
[1:49] to be changed I want to be changed from
[1:51] the creature that I once was from the
[1:54] creature that I am now to keep being
[1:56] changed every day every step that I take
[1:59] to keep being changed until we take that
[2:01] final change so that's the blessing that
[2:03] I'm looking forward to night let's just
[2:07] go to the Lord in prayer before we would
[2:09] get into the scripture we bow our heads
[2:11] well God we're so grateful to be able to
[2:14] come together and gather together around
[2:16] your people Lord Jesus and I kind of a
[2:18] great blessing to be able to to look at
[2:20] upon your bride and just speak to her
[2:22] Lord this this privilege lady Lord and I
[2:25] pray God that you'll give me the words
[2:27] to treat her right tonight Lord Jesus
[2:28] Lord I feel like maybe David with his
[2:31] little sling Lord Jesus when he let
[2:33] loose that rock Lord all I got is a rock
[2:35] but I've got I've got your word tonight
[2:37] Lord Jesus and I pray God that you'll
[2:39] guide it to where it hit its mark and
[2:42] grant that Lord Jesus that you'll come
[2:43] upon the scene the night Lord God and
[2:45] anoint your word that it won't just go
[2:48] out and involve oil Lord Jesus but we
[2:50] know we've got the promise of your
[2:52] scripture that's your word when will
[2:53] never return void but it'll accomplish
[2:56] it'll produce what it was written what
[2:58] it was said that it would do and that's
[3:00] what we're expecting tonight Lord God
[3:02] that your word will produce a change
[3:03] that it won't just fall forward but
[3:05] it'll produce something us in us Lord
[3:07] and so we're trusting Lord God for that
[3:09] change we ask your blessing upon this
[3:12] the reading of the word the hearing of
[3:13] it Lord tonight and we invite you Lord
[3:15] that you'll come and be welcome Lord
[3:17] Lord here tonight we open up we've
[3:20] opened up the doors to the church Lord
[3:22] and now we open up the doors of our
[3:23] heart Lord God and we pray Lord that
[3:25] you'll just feel welcome and move among
[3:26] us Lord Jesus sit on the pews with us
[3:29] and be welcome Lord God we pray when he
[3:32] asked us these things in the name of the
[3:33] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[3:38] so let's read I'm gonna preach a little
[3:40] sermon on works tonight we we know we
[3:42] preached a lot about faith I'm gonna
[3:44] preach about works so let's let's start
[3:49] on Matthew 14 26 29 and maybe the top of
[3:53] God take tonight is you know brother
[3:55] Branham talked about how he liked those
[3:56] three word topics and I'm gonna take a
[3:58] three word topic called the written word
[4:00] walk and so we read here in verse 26 and
[4:06] when the disciples saw him walking on
[4:08] the sea they were trouble saying it as a
[4:10] spirit and they cried out for fear but
[4:13] straightway Jesus spake unto them saying
[4:15] be of good cheer it is I be not afraid
[4:17] and Peter answered him and said lord if
[4:21] it be thou bid me come unto thee on the
[4:23] water and he said come and when Peter
[4:28] was come down out of the ship he walked
[4:30] on the water to go to Jesus and now
[4:33] let's read Psalm chapter 40 verses 78
[4:36] which says then said I lo I come and the
[4:41] volume of the book it is written of me I
[4:43] delight to do thy will o my God gave our
[4:47] law is within my heart that you may be
[4:50] seated
[4:51] the Lord had his blessing to the reading
[4:52] of the word and I will take a starter
[4:55] drink of water
[5:04] so we're reading in this scripture if we
[5:06] wanted to go back a little bit and see
[5:07] how this how this all started Jesus was
[5:10] he was teaching the ones that there that
[5:12] on this on the seaside and and they
[5:16] began to sin brother Brown tells it and
[5:17] the testimony on the sea and many other
[5:19] script messages that he preached about
[5:22] how maybe they were saying their
[5:24] goodbyes and they were all how it's so
[5:26] hard to say goodbye to like when you get
[5:28] together with a fellowship even here at
[5:30] our church when you when you get to
[5:31] leave it whizzed a nice and whatever
[5:33] it's it's so hard to say goodbye because
[5:36] it's like you know you get around that
[5:38] front that good fellowship the honey
[5:39] starts flowing and
[5:41] and you can't hardly leave one another
[5:42] and I believe that's the way it's
[5:43] supposed to be well you you love one
[5:45] another something's being manifested you
[5:48] something's drawn you in and it was so
[5:50] it was real hard for them to say goodbye
[5:52] and they were waving and everything and
[5:54] and Jesus told him you know there's one
[5:57] there's one scripture where it says
[5:58] Jesus knew that they were about to make
[6:00] him King so he he set things in motion
[6:02] to kind of get out of there and he said
[6:05] his disciples because it wasn't time and
[6:07] you know you look at the type of how the
[6:08] Scriptures laid out how this little
[6:10] story is laid out there's things at the
[6:12] beginning and at the end that the
[6:14] parallel a lot of things that have
[6:16] happened down through the seven Church
[6:17] ages and things like that but at any
[6:20] rate he he began to tell him to go ahead
[6:23] on out on the water take their boat and
[6:25] go ahead on on to the other side and and
[6:29] he'd catch up with him a little bit
[6:30] later and and there he went and he went
[6:32] on up to the on up to the top of a
[6:35] mountain where he could observe and
[6:37] brother Brennan tells us that you know
[6:39] it's like he climbed up to the cross he
[6:41] clipped climbing on up to the ramparts
[6:43] where he could watch over us and down
[6:45] through the seven Church ages down and
[6:47] watch it and keep an eye on us and and
[6:49] and help us and minister to us in that
[6:52] way and so so they went and they they
[6:55] began to they left Jesus and they they
[6:59] went on out and into the water and the
[7:01] testimony in the sea brother branham
[7:02] release how they begin to talk about the
[7:05] things that they had seen and maybe I
[7:07] want to just kind of reflect on the
[7:09] night that they were there they had they
[7:11] had heard and seen a lot of things they
[7:14] had heard and seen a lot you think they
[7:16] saw how jesus had broke the bread and I
[7:19] hate you fed 5,000 with five little
[7:21] biscuits and and how he had He healed
[7:24] the blind and and and all the great
[7:26] miracles and the signs and things that
[7:28] had been doing and he they had heard him
[7:30] talk about things and and they so they
[7:32] were holding these things in their heart
[7:33] and they began to tell one another they
[7:35] began to testify and relate all these
[7:38] things and as they were beginning to
[7:40] testify our storm one whirls up and
[7:42] that's that's just like the devil as
[7:44] soon as you began to test it behind here
[7:46] here comes something we were actually
[7:49] riding in the car and-and-and a friend
[7:51] of ours that my wife knows
[7:53] I'm gonna use this this is this is fresh
[7:56] a friend at my wife knows he's preaching
[7:59] at another church tonight and whatever
[8:01] again they were texting back and forth
[8:02] talking about how as soon as you get
[8:04] ready to preach the devil will come
[8:06] around and start making the kids
[8:07] aggravate it makes making them deuce
[8:09] it's like as soon as you start talking
[8:11] about the Lord then here come the kids
[8:13] in there to pull at you and do stuff or
[8:15] whatever that's not the kids really it's
[8:17] it it's the devil's trying to disrupt
[8:20] things he tries to he tries to get in
[8:22] there and cause a disruption and so the
[8:24] devil you know I wanna I want to get
[8:27] down to the nitty-gritty tonight because
[8:28] the devil what he does is he causes a
[8:31] disturbance so much especially in this
[8:33] day and this day there are so many
[8:35] storms in people's lives there's so many
[8:38] things that rose up there's things like
[8:40] depression and complexes listen
[8:43] depression or the devil will give you a
[8:45] storm of depression where you feel like
[8:47] nobody cares about you and everybody
[8:49] hates you you start feeling all down and
[8:52] everything that maybe even God doesn't
[8:54] care about you but I want to I want to
[8:56] declare to you tonight that God gave his
[8:58] spirit has assigned to you that he loves
[9:00] you he sent ministers behind the pulpit
[9:03] to declare to you that he loves you and
[9:04] you start feeling all down and
[9:06] everything and you get a complex because
[9:08] somebody said something to you somebody
[9:10] said something one time and you build up
[9:12] this big old complex that will hang on
[9:14] with you all your life and see what what
[9:16] happened was that the this storm rose up
[9:19] and and maybe that the disciples were
[9:21] sitting there in the boat and they began
[9:22] to think within their minds that there
[9:24] was no deliverance from that storm that
[9:26] that storm was going to take them down
[9:28] and drag them to the bottom of the sea
[9:31] and maybe tonight you're sitting here
[9:33] with a storm in your life something
[9:34] happening that maybe your children going
[9:37] out in the world things going wrong
[9:38] you're in danger of losing your job
[9:41] things going wrong at work and you think
[9:43] that life that storms are gonna drag you
[9:45] down but I want to declare to you
[9:47] tonight that there is a power of God
[9:49] that is able to deliver you there is
[9:52] there's something I'm speaking on words
[9:55] tonight that faith is going to produce
[9:57] something if you believe God it will
[9:59] produce something God can come upon the
[10:02] scene and deliver you
[10:03] he can deliver you from your depression
[10:07] he can deliver you from your complexes
[10:09] he can deliver you from your addiction
[10:10] he can deliver you from the idea that
[10:13] it's too late to be saved that it's too
[10:15] late you look around the world and think
[10:16] see all the signs and the things that
[10:18] are taking place and and you start
[10:20] getting a fearful idea a fearful mind
[10:23] and you think well it's it's too late
[10:24] for me to understand the things that are
[10:26] in the message it's too late for me to
[10:28] have a relationship with God but it's
[10:31] not too late while the message is still
[10:33] being preached while the gospel is still
[10:35] being proclaimed you can still come to
[10:37] the altar and I want to declare to you
[10:39] tonight that the altar is still waiting
[10:42] for those that are that are we love that
[10:44] something's pulsating within their heart
[10:46] the altar is still there I still believe
[10:48] in the old sawdust trail I still believe
[10:51] in the in the and a dying out a killing
[10:54] a little yourself a dumping out so that
[10:56] you can be filled that's what I believe
[10:58] that's what I stand for tonight I
[10:59] believe that God is able to deliver you
[11:02] from the battles of life no matter what
[11:05] anybody else says what no matter what
[11:07] anybody else you hear anybody else that
[11:10] go back to the word and see what the
[11:12] word says and the word will always have
[11:14] a positive confession for you when you
[11:17] look into the word and see you can't
[11:19] look into the word and see anything but
[11:22] something positive because God's word he
[11:24] was positive he is able he is a
[11:26] deliverer of the word is able is it's
[11:28] available for you if you'll just open
[11:30] the door of your heart and believe it
[11:32] and receive it so the storm rose up and
[11:40] and here they look down and they saw and
[11:42] in the storm the one thing that would
[11:45] save them the one thing that could
[11:48] deliver them and they got scared of her
[11:49] here came if you could imagine as the
[11:52] the night the night came on it says in
[11:54] the fourth watches of the night the
[11:55] storm came up that when it was the
[11:57] darkest and they begin to look at how to
[11:59] prune the upon the water and they and
[12:01] they saw something moving it could you
[12:04] imagine being out on the dark I've heard
[12:06] the stories of people they get they fall
[12:08] off of ocean liners and stuff in there
[12:09] and they're floating out in the middle
[12:11] of the water and they say it's one of
[12:12] the scariest things because you you're
[12:14] afraid something's going to tickle you
[12:16] and your bottom of your feet
[12:17] you see the lights moving and as you
[12:19] begin to be fearful and so there they
[12:21] were out in the middle of the ocean out
[12:23] in the middle of that senior they
[12:24] they're looking out and they and they
[12:26] see something moving that that's past
[12:28] explaining they can't understand it
[12:31] I want to tell you it's a paradox you
[12:34] know what a paradox is a paradox is
[12:36] something that looks like it's wrong or
[12:39] you don't understand it until closer
[12:41] examination but when you look at a
[12:44] little bit closer it starts to make
[12:46] sense it begins to come in to come into
[12:49] reality what it really is a paradox when
[12:52] you first look at it it looks like
[12:54] something's something's off something's
[12:56] off-kilter and that's how people look at
[12:58] the gospel when they see God moving when
[13:01] they see God moving in a church in a
[13:03] situation like think of when somebody
[13:05] rises up and begins to speak in tongues
[13:07] that it just scares them when they feel
[13:09] the anointing of the Holy Spirit it
[13:11] scares them when they see people falling
[13:13] out in the aisle or running and
[13:14] screaming and shouting it scares them
[13:16] remember that your kid if you've ever
[13:18] taught if your kids have ever asked you
[13:21] why are you crying Mama and Daddy why
[13:24] what are you crying about what what's
[13:26] going on because the first time you see
[13:29] the presence of the Lord the first time
[13:31] you see it it scares you you don't know
[13:33] what what's going on but that's the only
[13:35] thing that could help you and people
[13:37] that people looked at brother Brent
[13:38] knows the message and they thought what
[13:39] I don't understand this is this man is
[13:42] he he's speaking he's telling people
[13:44] what's in their life it is discerning
[13:46] things he's speaking the things that
[13:48] it's in their heart and it's scared I'm
[13:50] instead of running to it the only thing
[13:52] that could help them they ran away from
[13:53] it many of them and so here all these
[13:56] people in this boat the disciples that
[13:58] had been taught that had been shown the
[14:00] things they had listened to Jesus
[14:02] talking and do all these things and I
[14:04] want to maybe say that they had a good
[14:06] mechanical understanding they had a good
[14:08] intellectual understanding of what the
[14:10] message was all about but I believe that
[14:13] the end of this day we need more than
[14:15] just the intellectual understanding we
[14:17] need something that we can walk home we
[14:19] need a substance and so Peter was the
[14:23] only one out of that whole
[14:24] boat load I want to ask you this morning
[14:26] there to die why was Peter the only one
[14:30] that stepped out of that boat why was he
[14:33] the only one you know you you ask
[14:39] yourself that question a lot of times in
[14:40] meetings and everything why doesn't
[14:42] everybody come up to the altar why and
[14:45] everybody clamoring to be saved why and
[14:47] everybody screaming and cried for
[14:49] deliverance but there's not there's just
[14:52] a few there's only there's a there's
[14:54] only going to be a few that will take a
[14:56] hold of God's Word and meet him and go
[14:59] out to meet him how can I walk on that
[15:01] water - can I walk the way that you're
[15:04] walking and I want to say maybe tonight
[15:07] you know what Peter took that first step
[15:09] he didn't take that first step just
[15:12] guessing he didn't take it presuming but
[15:15] I believe that many of us today are
[15:17] presuming that we've got the new birth
[15:18] and this is not a time for presuming
[15:21] anything do you know when this when the
[15:23] Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost
[15:25] all the presume and went out the window
[15:27] and every fiber of their being was
[15:30] filled with the Holy Ghost all of their
[15:31] sisters were overcome they they saw with
[15:34] their eyes the pillar of fire over each
[15:37] of their head they heard with their ears
[15:39] that with wind rushing through the
[15:41] building they spoke the word as they
[15:43] went outside they walked with their feet
[15:46] that their feet was shod with the
[15:47] preparation of peace they every fiber of
[15:50] their being the only thing I could
[15:51] imagine that maybe they didn't smell it
[15:53] but I believe they smelled maybe the
[15:55] cold off the altar because every fiber
[15:57] of their being they weren't presuming
[15:59] anymore you know I believe that we
[16:01] sometimes we we're scared of sensations
[16:04] and everything we know sensations and
[16:05] emotions is not the evidence but
[16:07] sometimes I want a blessing from God I
[16:10] want something real that I know that
[16:12] that there's some real gods that I'm
[16:14] walking in truth that I'm walking in the
[16:16] right way listen this is more than just
[16:20] psychology it's more than just just a
[16:23] philosophy that some somebody's got it's
[16:25] something real you know I think
[16:28] sometimes we we get so intellectual her
[16:31] he has it if somebody was gonna come
[16:33] down to their altar would sit back and
[16:34] say well that's God
[16:35] right way you don't need to do all that
[16:37] so kind of stuff and somebody will just
[16:38] stand up and scream you you sit back
[16:41] we'll say well that's not right you
[16:42] don't need to do all that kind of stuff
[16:43] well because we've been listening that
[16:46] the mechanics is supposed to make a way
[16:48] for the dynamics this month not supposed
[16:50] to block the dynamics just supposed to
[16:52] pay the way for the dynamics winded up
[16:55] when the mechanics have been sown then
[16:57] the dynamics have a way to come and
[16:59] quicken do you know that's the definite
[17:01] the difference between the Baptism and I
[17:03] Holy Ghost that that's what it confuses
[17:05] everybody what's the difference between
[17:06] the baddest and the Holy Ghost and the
[17:08] new birth the new birth is when the word
[17:11] has been sown and there's something to
[17:12] be quickened when the baptism it only
[17:15] goes cutting upon the word then it's a
[17:17] birth it produces something it produces
[17:19] a substance that you can walk on let me
[17:24] kiss my breath I don't mean to yell at
[17:32] you listen listen this message is not
[17:38] just an argument this message is not
[17:41] just a mechanical argument we sit around
[17:43] and we're born again because we can
[17:45] argue one another now we could we could
[17:47] say one person is right or one person is
[17:49] wrong that's not what this message is
[17:51] about you know you can get some
[17:56] mechanical it's you you overlook the
[17:57] working of the Spirit you can overlook
[18:00] what's going on in your life what's
[18:01] going on in the life of the church you
[18:03] think about do you think about when when
[18:05] uh what Jesus went up to the Pool of
[18:08] Bethesda and he was looking for somebody
[18:10] that looking for that man with that face
[18:12] that they could really believe that and
[18:13] he bypassed all the other ones that
[18:15] there that were waiting for that water
[18:17] that to stir them at the Pool of
[18:19] Bethesda and there he told him rise up
[18:22] take up your bed and walk but he
[18:24] believed him and you know the Pharisees
[18:27] were all sitting around and they could
[18:28] open up their Bible I lost my regular
[18:31] Bible so I've got this big giant Bible
[18:33] here today but they got they got they
[18:35] could open up their Bible anchor they
[18:37] could don't go on Old Testament they can
[18:38] see where that you wasn't supposed to do
[18:40] no work on the Sabbath they could prove
[18:42] it by the scriptures they can look into
[18:44] the world and see you're not supposed to
[18:46] do nothing on the sap
[18:47] but they didn't have the spirit to tell
[18:49] them the correct interpretation of that
[18:51] word so when that man rose up on the
[18:54] Sabbath all they had was that
[18:55] intellectual understand that they didn't
[18:57] know what it was and I want to declare
[18:59] to you we need the Spirit of God to come
[19:01] and tell us what the real meaning of its
[19:03] victory is not just the intellectual
[19:05] understanding we're gonna think about
[19:12] when Jesus when Jesus was sitting there
[19:15] all the people that had sitting there in
[19:18] the corner of that house when that when
[19:20] that little woman came and watched his
[19:21] feet
[19:22] and she came up and washed his feet
[19:24] whenever but nobody else would pay him
[19:26] no mind
[19:26] and Judas that was Judas his turning
[19:30] point the Bible says from that time on
[19:31] because he looked on that and he
[19:33] couldn't prove it he couldn't understand
[19:35] what was going on why would you why
[19:37] would you spend the whole year's wage on
[19:38] pouring out all that oil on this man why
[19:40] would you take the whole year away that
[19:42] if you live if you run it out it comes
[19:43] out to about $20,000 $20,000 you're
[19:46] pouring out on this man's feet why would
[19:48] you do that
[19:49] why that doesn't even make a lick of
[19:51] sense and and it wouldn't ignore them
[19:53] with the spiritual that she was
[19:55] anointing him for his burial and it had
[19:57] to be done
[19:57] and Jesus said from now on everybody's
[20:00] going to tell this story over and over
[20:02] again because something was happening it
[20:04] was beyond what was just this is the
[20:06] intellectual the mental conception of
[20:08] what was written in the Bible it was
[20:10] beyond just what was on the page of the
[20:11] book and I want to tell you we've got to
[20:13] get beyond what's just written on the
[20:15] page of the book so that it's written in
[20:17] her life
[20:18] it's got to be written in you and I it's
[20:21] got to be written in us not just on the
[20:23] pages of the book and that's what's
[20:25] happening now as you eat as you eat and
[20:27] believe and yield yourself and doubt and
[20:30] you are becoming the word do you do you
[20:32] realize what that means do you realize
[20:34] that what what that means is that you
[20:37] have the opportunity to become this word
[20:40] if you'll just eat it and they eat it at
[20:43] I give up to yourself die lay outside
[20:46] all the most denominational ideas that
[20:48] you're still hanging on to you lay off
[20:50] that's supposed to die all that stuff of
[20:53] all your ideas that you're carrying on
[20:55] all yours all you are your the ways of
[20:58] the Baptist a lot taller the ways of the
[21:00] Agosto started all those things at the
[21:03] top and if you want to know what life is
[21:06] read the message reason message it'll
[21:08] make the Bible cover into a new book
[21:13] maybe I should calm down before I lose
[21:16] my voice listen I I need the exercise
[21:34] so Jesus said they're there we're in the
[21:39] boat there they were in the boat and and
[21:41] and Peter looks out and he sees this man
[21:44] walking on the water and he sees this
[21:49] man walking and you know that's how many
[21:54] of us started our journey we didn't
[21:56] start it maybe you know you I know many
[21:59] of us we heard the doctrine of service
[22:00] see we heard this something's real but
[22:02] what really caught our attention was the
[22:04] same thing that called Paul's attention
[22:06] when he saw Stephen dying there he saw
[22:08] God living in a man he saw something
[22:11] real God walking on the water and he
[22:14] looked out there and he said there's
[22:16] there's a man this hey how many times in
[22:18] your life have you have you turned
[22:20] around maybe in a church service and
[22:21] there was somebody that you highly
[22:23] respect you looked up to somebody that
[22:26] that you saw God into and you shake
[22:28] their hand and hold them to you how many
[22:30] times have you you you watched people's
[22:33] lives and you're like I want to be like
[22:34] that person that person inspires me
[22:37] because you see God in their life you
[22:39] know brother and preach the sermon
[22:41] influences that your life is the
[22:43] greatest influence when I walk out from
[22:46] this pulpit my life will be a greater
[22:48] preacher than anything that I could sing
[22:50] tonight anything that you say
[22:52] it's diminished in front of what your
[22:55] life is you can say all kinds of stuff
[22:57] but if you don't live the lives and
[22:59] that's why I believe that Christians are
[23:02] supposed to show the same life the same
[23:05] thing that was in Jesus Christ a life of
[23:07] humility and meekness and patience and
[23:10] all of these virtues all of these things
[23:12] and roll up in the one where you can you
[23:14] can walk up to somebody you could take
[23:16] fruit off of that tree and you can eat
[23:18] it and get strength from it because you
[23:21] see the life of God in them and that's
[23:23] what drew Peter to take a step from that
[23:26] boat he said can I do the same thing
[23:29] that you're doing listen he had heard
[23:33] all the things about the works that I do
[23:36] shall you do also he had heard it
[23:39] preached but now he wanted to see it in
[23:42] action can I do the same thing that
[23:45] you're doing and that's my message
[23:48] tonight faith will produce works you can
[23:51] do same thing you can live a godly life
[23:56] because when the life of Christ is in
[23:58] you it will produce something it
[24:01] produces the mechanics it will produce a
[24:04] substance that you can walk on it will
[24:07] produce and evidence the evidence of
[24:10] things not seen the evidence what you're
[24:12] looking something that's not visible
[24:14] something that's real more real than
[24:17] this pulpit listen Peter hurt Peter
[24:23] heard that voice say come and that voice
[24:26] was really today you might you might
[24:29] imagine putting put to think about where
[24:32] you are now that that voice is echoing
[24:35] from another world another world drawing
[24:39] you from here to there and Peter stepped
[24:42] out he stepped out onto the water and
[24:45] something held him up listen that's
[24:49] something that held him up it's the same
[24:52] thing that's holding you up right now
[24:54] it's not just to make believe but it's a
[24:56] real genuine substance it's a real
[24:59] genuine thing that's carrying you
[25:02] you walking on something as something
[25:05] that is a substance that ties you back
[25:07] to the eternal the substance of an
[25:10] eternal life it's living inside of you
[25:12] something that's real and if you have
[25:16] never tasted of that substance I declare
[25:18] you to you tonight that there is a
[25:20] substances you could take a hold of it's
[25:22] a real thing that you can have if you
[25:25] want it if you want it you got a wound
[25:29] in them you know brother Bram talked
[25:35] about how you'd have to you'd have to
[25:37] step over Jesus to go to hell you'd have
[25:39] to step over the cross after all the
[25:41] things that God has done all the things
[25:43] that he's laying in front of you and yet
[25:45] you still turn it aside to listen listen
[25:48] Church Peter you know Peter when he
[25:50] stepped out he he maybe he faced the
[25:52] ridicule of all the ones that were
[25:53] sitting in that boat what are you doing
[25:55] Peter who do you think you are that do
[25:57] you think that you can cast out devils
[25:59] that you think you can take up serpents
[26:01] you can drink deadly things who are you
[26:03] to think that you can fulfill the the
[26:05] promises of the scripture that the
[26:07] promise will be fulfilled in your
[26:09] members that you can walk this gospel
[26:12] walk and there's a minute look at you
[26:14] tonight's little girls or sisters with
[26:16] your long hair and your dress on that
[26:18] looks many that look at you and say I
[26:19] wish I could walk that walk I wish I
[26:22] could talk that tub but I can't because
[26:24] you've got to have a substance you gotta
[26:27] have real substance to walk this gospel
[26:30] walk anywhere the presence the person of
[26:42] Jesus Christ is the acts will follow you
[26:46] can bank on that list of there's many
[26:48] impersonations and all of those kind of
[26:50] things but I guarantee you where the
[26:52] person of Jesus Christ is acts will
[26:54] follow because Jesus that I believe in
[26:58] the promises that Jesus gave to the
[27:00] church that we should cast out devils
[27:02] and you know you know better man told us
[27:04] that when you're when you come to the
[27:05] age of accountability there's a spirit
[27:07] that's lingering on you there's a spirit
[27:09] that moves upon you that says that says
[27:12] wait just a little bit longer wait just
[27:14] a little bit
[27:15] take a hold of it and there might be
[27:17] that spirit on you tonight way just a
[27:19] little bit longer it's not for you
[27:20] whatever but I believe that God gave a
[27:23] commission to the church to cast out
[27:24] spirits and I want to cast that spirit
[27:26] out tonight I want to cast that out so
[27:29] you can believe to make a way open for
[27:30] you to believe that you can claim every
[27:33] promise and that's written in the
[27:34] scripture now you know another thing
[27:43] that word come jesus said just have one
[27:45] word come he didn't say a great big many
[27:48] things but you know Peter caught
[27:50] something that one word he doesn't have
[27:55] to explain it and give a great big gold
[27:56] dissertation but you know when you could
[27:59] catch it in the word and you can see it
[28:00] written in the scripture then you just
[28:02] step out on faith on that when a
[28:04] Christian a Christian don't even know
[28:06] how to act and silts you they see it in
[28:08] the word but when you see it in the word
[28:10] you're like oh that's what I'm supposed
[28:13] to be oh do you mean this powers for me
[28:18] do you mean that I don't have to put up
[28:20] with the devil no more do you mean that
[28:23] I can I can put in beneath my feet do
[28:26] you mean that there ain't nothing in
[28:28] this world that can hold me back now do
[28:31] you mean all these things with a
[28:32] Christian begins to look in the word and
[28:34] see what the word says then they know
[28:37] how to act and I don't mean any like put
[28:40] on but they know what they're going for
[28:42] there know what their aim is for and
[28:44] then they can go and seek God and say
[28:46] make this real to me make this live in
[28:49] me that's mine listen faith is good but
[28:55] I got to have both of those evidences
[28:58] you must have faith and works because
[29:00] faith without works is dead faith
[29:02] without works can be imitated you can
[29:05] say I've got faith like that little girl
[29:08] and that very sir first what a sermon
[29:10] that brother Graham preached where
[29:12] brother they said you say you've got all
[29:13] faith now move this little chandelier
[29:15] thing moving and she said well I can't
[29:18] do that because she was flummoxed that
[29:20] that you would anybody would be able in
[29:23] the realm of possibility
[29:25] but the Bible says that all things are
[29:27] possible to them to believe all things
[29:30] are possible everything is possible you
[29:33] know that maybe that floats many of us
[29:35] when you when you heard the story of
[29:36] brother Branham saying that he can take
[29:38] a pocketknife that you left in your
[29:39] dresser and then he could put it in your
[29:41] pocket if you're if you're forgotten it
[29:43] but I know many here tonight they can
[29:45] testify that they've seen situations
[29:46] where God has taken your car keys that
[29:49] you left at the store whatever and he's
[29:51] put them right there in front of you but
[29:52] I remember this - hearing a story when I
[29:55] was younger this man he said I lost my
[29:57] car keys I couldn't find him anywhere so
[29:59] me and his brother began that we laid
[30:00] our hands on the hood of the car on the
[30:03] hood of the car we began to call out to
[30:04] God and when we opened our eyes there
[30:07] was the car keys laying in front of us
[30:08] because all things are possible to them
[30:11] to believe faith will produce something
[30:13] and listen it'll produce more than just
[30:15] your car keys it'll produce your
[30:17] children back in your home it'll produce
[30:19] your kids back in your church if you
[30:21] apply the token and put that token to
[30:23] work if you confess it before God and
[30:25] say I'll believe that you promised it
[30:26] and that settles it because listen
[30:28] though in the world of God when when the
[30:31] substance is indwelling and you it
[30:33] speaks back to you and says it's already
[30:36] done let's ask what I believe that the
[30:40] still small voice that goes back when I
[30:42] still small voice speaks to you it will
[30:44] speak it's already done it's finished
[30:48] the battle is over it's already been won
[30:50] and that then all you have to do is just
[30:52] walk because the battle is already over
[31:03] let's remember quote number two in
[31:06] investments brother I'm talking about
[31:09] his insufficiency he said I'm not
[31:11] sufficient to stand here to talk about a
[31:13] thing like this it's more I cannot I
[31:16] cannot bring myself into the spot and I
[31:19] put myself to be a teacher I couldn't do
[31:21] that because I haven't got the
[31:23] intellectual knowledge listen he's not
[31:26] talking about intellectual knowledge to
[31:28] the word he's not talking about word
[31:30] that can't be quicker that can be
[31:31] quickened but he's talking about knowing
[31:33] all kind of ABCs and maybe they're
[31:36] having a great big
[31:37] capillary and all those kind of things
[31:39] yeah listen you know how you could be
[31:41] like petered not hardly know nothing and
[31:42] understand the gospel the gospel ain't
[31:44] supposed to be understood by people with
[31:46] a great big old huge hands it's for
[31:48] anybody to take a hold of grasp hold on
[31:51] if you think I can't you you're not
[31:54] smart enough or bright enough to
[31:55] understand the gospel then then just
[31:57] humble yourself and let God speak to you
[32:00] a few times
[32:01] you because I said listen that's a lie
[32:04] of the devil this ain't for smart people
[32:07] but I have a revelation that's exactly
[32:09] with the word and the word lives back
[32:11] and produces what is saying it dude see
[32:16] see neither did apostle he goes on to
[32:18] say because why because the word will
[32:20] produce what is saying it dude maybe
[32:24] that's my whole message tonight I think
[32:26] we go billable getting so built up on
[32:28] philosophies and all kind of things
[32:29] wondering if they're worth the message
[32:31] is really true wonder if it'll really
[32:33] work in your life and once you go to God
[32:36] and find out if it'll really work or not
[32:38] once you go to God and find out if it's
[32:39] really true and all you have to do to
[32:44] see if it's really true is to look
[32:45] around you and see all the lives that
[32:46] have been changed see all the lives have
[32:49] been made to conform to the word that
[32:51] had been brought into his image the
[32:55] problem is is that we don't realize that
[32:59] we're needful keep reading Matthew 14 29
[33:04] to 32 and he said come and which Peter
[33:07] was come down out of the ship he walked
[33:10] on the water to go to Jesus but when he
[33:14] saw the wind boisterous he was afraid
[33:16] and beginning to sink he cried lord save
[33:22] me now how many of our walks are we get
[33:26] we get started and it starts out real
[33:28] good you go through when you get the new
[33:30] birth and all those things seems like
[33:32] it's going real good because you get
[33:34] through your honeymoon period with the
[33:35] Lord and everything is just wonderful
[33:37] never ever prayer you pray ever
[33:39] scripture read off it's just wonderful
[33:41] everything just Springs alive and then
[33:44] the devil turns his guns on you just
[33:47] like he did Jesus when he came from from
[33:48] the from the River Jordan and begin to
[33:50] walk into the wilderness and the devil
[33:52] because why do you the devil wants to
[33:54] see what's what you really made of the
[33:57] devil is actually acting as an
[33:59] instrument of God to test you and prove
[34:01] to you that you've got what you saved
[34:03] you and the devil begins to bang you on
[34:06] your sing is it really do you really
[34:08] know what you're talking about
[34:10] do you really have what you say you do
[34:11] and you people people get so discouraged
[34:14] so many times and they begin to think
[34:16] that God is not willing and they listen
[34:26] that's what that's what happened to
[34:28] Peter there in the boat he began to look
[34:31] at the storms and the winds and the
[34:33] waves all around him he began to look at
[34:35] his circumstances and he began to sink
[34:37] down into the into the mire of the winds
[34:39] and the waves and maybe maybe it was
[34:41] just his hand reached up his his hand
[34:43] went I'm gonna drop at eyes a little bit
[34:45] I'm gonna take some license here maybe
[34:47] his hand was the last thing to go and
[34:49] he's reaching Jesus help me Jesus and at
[34:54] just as he was about to sink down in the
[34:56] water Jesus came along now listen what
[34:59] kind of lesson can we learn there I
[35:00] think I think the lesson we did we can
[35:02] learn is that we need what we need is a
[35:05] guide we need some help we need some
[35:07] help to guide us along through life you
[35:09] know brother man I've talked about how
[35:11] that time he he looked at his true
[35:13] turning points in life that God showed
[35:15] him how he took him by the that mountain
[35:18] range that had his name and written in
[35:21] and now he showed him how his whole life
[35:23] could've been across the street how it
[35:25] how it could have been that that dump
[35:27] heap on the side of the road and he
[35:28] looked there and his name was inscribed
[35:30] on those mountain peaks it has seven
[35:32] peaks he kept getting bigger and bigger
[35:34] you know what that was he called an
[35:36] everlasting sign an everlasting sign to
[35:39] look at a memorial you know there's a
[35:41] lot of everlasting signs that brother
[35:43] Ellen talked about one was that a virgin
[35:45] shall conceive one was that wasn't that
[35:47] Jesus would rise from the dead an
[35:49] everlasting sign that God would reveal
[35:51] himself in flesh but he was walking down
[35:54] that mountain range he was walking down
[35:56] that through that mount those mounds of
[35:59] his life and you've got to walk
[36:01] the mountains of your life - you've got
[36:03] to take that same journey the same
[36:05] journey that Abraham took the same
[36:07] journey that brother Brown took the same
[36:09] three pools of your journey but to take
[36:11] that journey you need a guide you need a
[36:14] guide or you'll get lost but the problem
[36:16] is so many of us we think we think we
[36:18] don't need a guide you remember that
[36:20] story that Brennaman told about when he
[36:22] was preaching the guy he said I got out
[36:24] there in the woods on his honeymoon
[36:26] after he had taken his wife to Niagara
[36:28] Falls and he took her out on that
[36:30] hunting trip on their honeymoon and he
[36:31] said I got to thinking that I'm a
[36:33] wilderness man I know all about this
[36:36] situation I know how to tell which way
[36:38] the sun's rising and how to take care of
[36:42] myself at night when it gets cold and
[36:43] all these kind of things but then when
[36:45] the when the gloom rose in when there
[36:47] wouldn't win it when he after he had
[36:50] killed his deer and got all that
[36:52] situated and everything then they began
[36:54] to realize that he was lost and I think
[36:58] that's one of our dilemmas denied us is
[37:00] we don't realize or maybe you don't
[37:02] realize when you're lost that's what the
[37:07] gospel is for listen the gospel is to
[37:09] let you know when you're lost to let you
[37:12] know when you're not matching up with
[37:13] the word what the word says when you can
[37:16] look in this and say something's off
[37:18] with my life you hear them be the
[37:20] minister preaching and something's off I
[37:22] need something but you know you need
[37:25] something and he needed a guide and
[37:26] begin to cry out I need something and
[37:29] and it Eddy you know we still you know
[37:31] the story about he went through all the
[37:32] dough that if the things that finally he
[37:34] reached up and there was that telephone
[37:37] wire what we need is a phone line back
[37:42] to God and the phone line right here is
[37:45] this word where you can know what God's
[37:47] will is for you in this day and so we
[37:53] followed that guide he kept his hand on
[37:56] the guide he kept his hand on the phone
[37:58] line all the way back to his destination
[37:59] so I want to declare to you tonight
[38:02] don't let your hand off the wire don't
[38:04] let you don't get your eyes off Jesus
[38:06] like Peter did just stick right with the
[38:09] wire and it'll lead you
[38:10] right on to your destination because
[38:15] John chapter 16 verse 13 says howbeit
[38:17] when he the Spirit of Truth has come he
[38:19] will guide you into all truth he will
[38:22] guide you through all the perils and
[38:24] this and the looked like setbacks of a
[38:27] scripture he'll lead you and guide you
[38:28] through all this truth and what it is is
[38:31] you're doing just like Peter did you're
[38:33] walking through this scripture it's a
[38:35] written word walk and you're taking one
[38:38] step at a time but the first step is the
[38:41] most important the first step that you
[38:44] take is like Peters first step the first
[38:46] step is when you realize that you lost
[38:49] and what you need to do is repent you
[38:54] know and when Elijah came on the scene
[38:56] there and they were in first Kings
[38:57] chapter 17 he said raining will not fall
[39:00] until I call for it and you know when
[39:04] rain would fall what the signal was for
[39:06] the rain to fall is when the people
[39:09] repented after all the things done with
[39:12] the pouring on the water of the altar
[39:13] and all the the killing the promise of
[39:15] bail then the people repented and the
[39:17] rain began to fall and that's what will
[39:20] trigger the rain to fall in your life is
[39:22] when you repent you need to repent
[39:25] repent every one of you in the name of
[39:27] the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission
[39:28] of your sin come up to the altar whether
[39:31] it's stand up in your seat and repent
[39:33] because you need this God you need it
[39:36] but you got to recognize your needs you
[39:39] must recognize that you need a God you
[39:43] got to recognize it like Peter
[39:45] recognized it when he thought he knew
[39:47] how to do it II thought I'm walking
[39:49] pretty good here I'm getting along
[39:51] pretty good and then he he thought he
[39:53] had it all figured out how many of us we
[39:55] think we got it all figured out because
[39:57] we read a little bit of the scripture we
[39:59] think we've got it all figured out for
[40:01] the beginning of the end but you know
[40:04] what you don't have nothing figured out
[40:06] like you think you do as Paul said if
[40:08] you think you have knowledge you don't
[40:09] have knowledge like you think you do if
[40:11] you don't have the guide because he's
[40:13] the one that will give you instruction
[40:17] he gave the promise but you've got to
[40:21] receive it and you know the thing Peter
[40:28] Peter got out there walking on the water
[40:30] and you know like so many of us do we
[40:32] think we think we're supposed to be the
[40:34] ones that are providing we're so we
[40:37] think we're the ones that are supposed
[40:38] to be living the life you're eating the
[40:40] scripture about how you're supposed to
[40:42] be acting a certain way or doing a
[40:44] certain thing and before long you're
[40:46] trying to put you're trying to put
[40:47] feathers in we're where they're not
[40:49] growing out naturally you're trying to
[40:51] prop up something you're trying to
[40:55] you're trying to make do and act a
[40:56] certain way instead of letting it be
[40:58] genuine you know the way I am I'd rather
[41:00] somebody just be genuine if if you can't
[41:05] hardly help certain a certain thing just
[41:07] to let it just let it be natural don't
[41:10] be put on don't let don't be fake I'd
[41:12] rather see somebody be genuine and true
[41:15] than somebody be fake anyway because you
[41:17] know what if you're just if you're just
[41:19] a genuine sinner and you're just genuine
[41:22] you're just a good old genuine sinner
[41:23] when the power the Holy Ghost comes on
[41:25] you and quickens the word that you've
[41:27] heard then you'll be a genuine the Holy
[41:30] Ghost filled believer and everybody will
[41:31] know it the transition will be a paired
[41:34] everybody will see that you've been
[41:36] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[41:39] it'll be out it'll be a right out there
[41:42] in the open just be genuine and
[41:44] everything that you do elicit Peter
[41:51] Peter walking on that water at least one
[41:56] thing he did was he cried out you know
[41:59] when I said another mistake many of us
[42:01] do we won't cry out for help
[42:02] we'll sit there while and then I better
[42:04] pain putting up with all the stuff that
[42:07] the devil puts on us just letting the
[42:09] devil do have his way with us just do
[42:11] whatever the devil or maybe it's the
[42:14] Lord's will for me to be depressed
[42:16] maybe it's the Lord is the middle wheel
[42:17] for me to just be just maybe I just
[42:20] can't live this old gospel way maybe I
[42:22] just can't do it but listen the gospel
[42:25] was sent the power of the Holy Ghost was
[42:27] sent so you don't have to put
[42:29] with the devil you don't have to sit
[42:30] with him riding on your coattails you
[42:32] don't have to sit with him parsnip on
[42:34] your shoulder you don't have to put up
[42:36] with the devil tonight there's a
[42:38] delivery deliverance for you the church
[42:41] was sitting it with the power to cast
[42:42] out Devils you don't have to live with
[42:45] that devil there's a deliverance for you
[42:47] just believe God's Word and accept it
[42:49] confess it and go on and believe it but
[42:57] you gotta take that first step let's
[43:00] look at let's look at quote number six
[43:08] I'm reading these all out of order but
[43:10] anyway the future home with a heavenly
[43:13] bridegroom brother Branham said now
[43:16] let's pick that before we read this
[43:17] quote when you leave it up there but
[43:18] picture in your mind Peter in that boat
[43:20] and he's wondering can I do what Jesus
[43:23] did he's doing it and he asked him can I
[43:26] come walking to you Peter says come and
[43:29] so Peter takes that first step what's
[43:32] your first step is a Christian brother
[43:34] branham explained what's your first step
[43:36] is he explained your first step in the
[43:38] church agents book explained it here in
[43:40] the future home and he said now the
[43:42] first step is repentance towards God and
[43:46] then follows after that your next step
[43:50] see look how do I start being a
[43:53] Christian how do I be a Christian you
[43:55] take your first step that's all it takes
[43:58] to be a Christian as you just put your
[44:00] foot out and lean on that substance and
[44:03] let it come down on that substance put
[44:06] your foot down and then you take another
[44:07] step and then you take another step and
[44:11] you just keep walking until you see
[44:13] God's Word being manifested in your life
[44:15] and you keep walking and you keep
[44:17] stepping until it'll be written of you
[44:19] he walked like Enoch did even walk with
[44:23] God and he was not found and you were
[44:25] walking you're walking till you'll take
[44:27] another step and one day you won't be
[44:29] found anymore but you got to take that
[44:31] first step and then take that first step
[44:33] you got to lay a hot lay aside all the
[44:36] the
[44:36] you got to not care anymore you got to
[44:40] not care what people think about you you
[44:42] got to not care what your friends think
[44:44] what your friends think on Facebook or
[44:47] Instagram or whatever who cares if they
[44:49] see you shouting and screaming or crying
[44:51] in the middle of the church who cares if
[44:53] if they see you doing something that
[44:55] seems unseemly to the world but to the
[44:58] group to them to the Christian is
[45:00] righteousness who cares what anybody
[45:02] says if if they see the mascara running
[45:05] down your face because something got
[45:06] ahold of you who cares what the world
[45:09] thinks that's our problem as we care too
[45:12] much what the other people in the boat
[45:13] think of us we're looking too much of
[45:15] the other people in the boat and say oh
[45:17] nobody else has stepped out so I can't
[45:19] step out you be the first one if you
[45:21] think the church ain't lively enough you
[45:24] be the first one you be the walking
[45:26] around up and down the aisle if you
[45:27] think if you think there's a problem in
[45:30] the church you be the one to set it
[45:32] right you'd be the one to take that step
[45:34] oh goodness
[45:40] listen let's read this quote now the
[45:44] first step is repentance toward God then
[45:47] follows after that there's water baptism
[45:50] water baptism repent and be baptized in
[45:53] the name of Jesus Christ see water
[45:56] baptism fall of showing that repentance
[45:58] was genuine or to remit our past sins
[46:02] that has nothing to do with future sin
[46:04] it only remits
[46:06] repent and be baptized in the name of
[46:08] Jesus Christ
[46:09] what for remission taken away of past
[46:13] sin has nothing to do with the future
[46:14] just your sin has been chopped off what
[46:17] you did you can't repair for what Adam
[46:20] done you never did it Adam did you just
[46:24] get forgiveness for what you done the
[46:26] old naturist excuse me I didn't mean to
[46:29] do that let's listen do you realize well
[46:35] no second here
[46:38] do you realize why you need to be
[46:41] justified and sanctified and born
[46:43] baptized with the Holy Ghost do you
[46:45] realize you realize why you need to go
[46:47] through those steps because you've got
[46:49] to get you got to clear a path for the
[46:51] bastards normally ghost you got to clear
[46:54] a path
[46:55] you got to clear away your old sins had
[46:58] to be cleared away because it's in your
[47:00] hair how could how can God come and live
[47:02] with me at all this stuff I've done you
[47:04] got to get that cleared away and soon
[47:06] you repent and all that gets washed away
[47:08] and then it's time to be sanctified it's
[47:11] time to go clean up and you begin
[47:13] something against the dealing with your
[47:15] conscience and you go for one of them do
[47:17] you remember that time I stole that pair
[47:19] of socks from you do you remember that
[47:20] time I did something I spoke against you
[47:22] are you clearing everything up because
[47:24] you want to be safe too far there's
[47:26] something in you that's driving you to
[47:28] be clean but something in you that's
[47:30] driving you to do something you wouldn't
[47:31] do otherwise the gold otherwise I'd say
[47:34] I'm sorry for what I've done I'm sorry
[47:36] forgive me for all the stuff I've done
[47:38] and you clear all that out and then
[47:40] there ain't no impediment you've got to
[47:42] get all that stuff out of the way to
[47:43] repent get all that stuff out of the way
[47:46] and then there ain't nothing to hinder
[47:47] the baptism that all it goes from coming
[47:50] on you everything's out of the way and
[47:52] then you can receive freely see when
[47:56] you've done all that when you repent
[47:58] when you've got all that out of the way
[48:01] you don't have to pray then all that's
[48:04] left for you to do is to go through the
[48:07] wedding ceremony the preacher gets up
[48:09] there and says will you take this man to
[48:12] be your lawfully wedded husband and
[48:14] you're sitting there listen to the
[48:16] preacher preach there's something within
[48:18] your heart says I do
[48:21] I do take this Jesus Christ to be my
[48:24] lawfully wedded husband I do take him
[48:27] and something drops down into your soul
[48:30] and becomes quickened to you and it's
[48:33] quicken to you this become a living
[48:34] reality you then because you've been wet
[48:37] and you've gone through the process of
[48:38] where everything's been stripped away
[48:40] yeah that's how probably we don't want
[48:43] to go through that process but you've
[48:45] got to die to yourself you've got a
[48:48] you've got to repent and say I don't
[48:50] care what the world thinks let all this
[48:53] thing fall away and then then you're
[48:55] said to take a journey what kind of
[48:59] journey a journey of walking into
[49:03] identification and that's what I believe
[49:07] our God called ministers said to do is
[49:10] to identify the Church of the Living God
[49:12] it's to identify what God has done to
[49:15] identify scripturally who the bride is
[49:18] and that's what you're doing you're
[49:20] walking into identification you're
[49:22] walking into the into the message that
[49:24] you've heard you were walking into it
[49:27] one step at a time you know you think
[49:31] like like John when he came onto the
[49:32] scene
[49:33] everybody was going in the wrong
[49:35] direction the Pharisees thought they had
[49:37] the Sabbath all understood they thought
[49:40] they had it all understood because they
[49:41] think it like like we've heard brother
[49:43] around talked about how they could put a
[49:44] opinion through the scroll and tell
[49:47] where whatever letter that was here they
[49:48] understood mentally the word of that
[49:52] much but then John comes on the scene
[49:55] and what he's doing he begins to turn
[49:58] everybody we got to go over this way and
[50:02] he begins to turn them toward theirs
[50:04] coming to Messiah the word has begin to
[50:07] come and Plainview and he had to turn
[50:09] them that way so that they could walk
[50:11] that way that's what that's what the
[50:14] Prophet had to do we had to come this
[50:16] day he had to come and bring as a
[50:18] message to turn us to literally turn us
[50:21] to literally turn the hearts of the
[50:23] children back to the original faith to
[50:25] literally turn us so that we could walk
[50:28] that way if he had to come we woulda
[50:30] just walked off the world I reckon but
[50:33] he had to come so that we could be
[50:35] literally turned and walk that way and
[50:39] you heard the voice just like Peter did
[50:41] that boy said come that voice is the one
[50:44] that voices like John said boys the boys
[50:47] cried a voice of one crying in the
[50:48] wilderness and we've heard the voice the
[50:51] voice of someone from another world
[50:54] voice from another world that you can't
[50:56] see calling you to update it to be
[50:58] identified with him and you think look
[51:01] back look back to your walk of how
[51:04] simple it was how simple your walk is
[51:06] that's what I want to do now is I want
[51:08] to identifying you they'll walk that
[51:11] you've taken because God has taken you
[51:13] through a journey just like he took
[51:15] Abraham just like your seven peaks said
[51:17] he took brother Branham through and he
[51:19] looked there and he said look your name
[51:21] is inscribed on those mountains listen
[51:23] you could even go on Google Maps and
[51:25] search for Branham Peaks that's how much
[51:27] his name was inscribed on those
[51:29] mountains his name is even written their
[51:31] own Google Maps it's written on the map
[51:34] Branham is there you can go read it
[51:36] because God wrote it listen God wrote
[51:39] his name and those Peaks before he ever
[51:42] changed Abraham's name he wrote his name
[51:46] in those Peaks because it was sitting
[51:48] there and you looked back through your
[51:49] life and see how God wrote his name in
[51:52] your life as you took your journey you
[51:55] started off walking one step at a time
[51:57] one step and you began to be identified
[52:01] with the word like for example in Exodus
[52:06] where it says and thou shalt make
[52:08] curtains of goats hair to be a covering
[52:10] upon the tabernacle eleven curtains
[52:13] shalt thou make and over in first
[52:15] Corinthians that says but a woman if a
[52:17] woman have long hair it is a glory to
[52:20] her for her hair is given her for a
[52:22] covering she's got that hair to cover
[52:25] that Tabernacle the show as a sign that
[52:27] she believed the message for her day and
[52:30] to show really what is showing is that
[52:33] the word has produced something in her
[52:36] life
[52:39] and you know you know many times you're
[52:44] we stumble over preaching clothes and
[52:46] clothes our clothes line religion but I
[52:48] want to preach tonight a clothes line
[52:49] religion it's not a clothes line
[52:51] religion because somebody forced you to
[52:53] do it but it's a clothes line religion
[52:55] because you looked into the pages of the
[52:57] Bible and you said I don't want to do
[52:58] that I want to match up with the
[53:00] requirement of the word I want to do
[53:03] that because the word says to do it and
[53:05] you lay it aside everything of this
[53:07] world like unlike soul who were the same
[53:10] you came on to me and said why do I hear
[53:11] the bleeding of the goats and the sheep
[53:13] why's there stuff that you still hadn't
[53:15] killed kill it all let it all down let
[53:19] everything of this world perish so that
[53:21] you can manifest every jot and tittle of
[53:25] the word that every last bit yet Jesus
[53:28] said I'm there on the run the River
[53:29] Jordan it becometh us to fulfill all
[53:31] righteousness everything that's written
[53:34] in the pages of this Bible has got to be
[53:36] fulfilled and you are the one that's
[53:38] going to fulfill it
[53:39] it's do you realize that you realize
[53:42] what that power was that that that Peter
[53:44] was walking on that power that he was
[53:47] what power do you have the power that
[53:51] you have is that you are the seed of God
[53:55] hidden in an earthen vessel you are the
[53:58] seed you are the two evidences hidden in
[54:01] the earthen vessel you are the seed of
[54:03] God in flesh just like Jesus as he
[54:06] walked the shores of Galilee just like
[54:08] all the ones of old they brewed and
[54:11] testified of this Dave when God will be
[54:14] revealed in your flesh tabernacle in
[54:16] your members and that's what that that
[54:19] longer hair that that a woman wears
[54:21] testifies off I've heard the message of
[54:24] the day I've heard it I've matched up my
[54:26] life it's matching pieces everything
[54:30] matches up well where am I let's say
[54:41] let's read let's read quote number nine
[54:43] everybody doing all right
[54:45] [Applause]
[54:49] the rent said in Israel in the church he
[54:52] said don't be deceived you could better
[54:58] search this clothes now see if you keep
[55:01] on saying well I don't don't condemn me
[55:04] to do this don't continue to do that
[55:07] things of the world now I'm going to
[55:10] hurt you just a little bit pull the
[55:12] feathers back the other way that's quote
[55:13] number nine brothers but it's this one
[55:16] sure evidence you never been to Christ
[55:20] you never been born here if you're still
[55:23] long for the things of this world if you
[55:26] still if you don't see God's Word being
[55:28] manifested in if you can't stay away for
[55:31] the things of the world he that loves
[55:33] the world or the things of the world the
[55:35] love of God's not even in it now if you
[55:38] just quit it doing it because you dog
[55:39] you know you ought to do it and quit
[55:41] doing this that's the sign that you
[55:43] haven't gotten nowhere yet when that
[55:46] thing becomes dead in you and the nature
[55:49] of us going away there's another person
[55:52] in there and it can only produce the
[55:56] Holy Spirit that was in Christ and you
[55:59] produces the christ-like life nothing
[56:03] you do what he did he chose that before
[56:08] the foundation of the world let's go to
[56:10] let's go to number ten I just go to
[56:13] number ten I read Colossians 3:12 3:16
[56:16] because I want to look at what it will
[56:19] produce on you put on therefore as the
[56:23] elect of God holy and beloved bowels of
[56:27] mercies do you think think about this do
[56:31] you see these things written in your
[56:33] life bowels of mercies kindness
[56:40] humbleness of mine meekness
[56:44] long-suffering forbearing one another
[56:49] and forgiving one another if any man
[56:54] have a quarrel against any even as
[56:57] Christ forgave you
[56:59] so also do you listen y'all well you can
[57:05] get to the point where you love one
[57:07] another so much you could have somebody
[57:09] spit in your face like they did Jesus if
[57:12] somebody slaps you across the face you
[57:14] still love them and I'm not talking
[57:16] about from a put-on love I'm not talking
[57:19] about where you've kind of fake patience
[57:20] and you think that you've got a volcano
[57:23] of Rage hiding underneath the surface
[57:25] but I'm talking about a real something
[57:28] real and genuine that you really love
[57:31] one another that's what we're coming to
[57:36] if any man have a quarrel guess Deana
[57:39] even as Christ forgave you so also do ye
[57:42] can you forgive your brother and above
[57:47] all these things put on charity which is
[57:51] the bond of perfectness you know with
[57:55] say charity is love but charity is being
[57:58] a Christian which is living your life
[58:01] for others charity is given giving of
[58:05] yourself ready to give everything if
[58:09] necessary ready to help your brother
[58:12] because do unto others as you would have
[58:14] them do unto you
[58:15] maybe you think about these all these
[58:17] scriptures that you think seems so
[58:19] simple but that's the Christian life
[58:21] that's the Christian life that that you
[58:23] can't put on you can try to put them
[58:26] feathers in you like brother I'm talked
[58:28] about with this weird something real
[58:30] then everybody will be able to know it
[58:32] and God will do it and the devil will
[58:36] know it and above all and he said and
[58:41] let the peace of God rule in your hearts
[58:43] to the which also you are called in one
[58:46] body and be thankful you know what you
[58:49] know what the peace of God is the peace
[58:52] of God is not well I hope everything
[58:54] will be alright the peace of God is not
[58:57] you know listen Peter there in the midst
[59:00] of all the storms all of the things
[59:03] raging when Jesus got back to the boat
[59:07] peace was in the boat and the wind
[59:09] ceased because peace
[59:12] peace is the word and will you have the
[59:16] word then that brings peace peace to you
[59:22] you are the walking seed word that's
[59:28] what I'm gonna end here so the music's
[59:29] just can go ahead and come forward
[59:31] immediately in Matthew 14 31 32 it says
[59:36] immediately Jesus stretched forth his
[59:38] hand and called him and said unto Him o
[59:40] thou of little faith wherefore didst
[59:44] thou down and when they were coming to
[59:47] the ship the wind ceased the wind ceased
[59:51] when Jesus was in the book I don't ask
[59:55] you tonight if Jesus is not in your boat
[59:57] you've heard the gospel call you've
[59:59] heard the gospel call for many years but
[1:00:02] maybe tonight who knows maybe tonight is
[1:00:05] the first night it really sunk into you
[1:00:08] and you realized that you were lost and
[1:00:10] that you needed a guide you needed
[1:00:12] somebody to guide you back to the boat
[1:00:14] you need somebody to get in the boat
[1:00:17] with you so I wonder if tonight if you
[1:00:21] realize you need something would you
[1:00:23] lift your hands up to God I'm lifted my
[1:00:26] hand up because I need more I need
[1:00:30] something I need God more now than ever
[1:00:33] that God sees your head listen you think
[1:00:36] that's just a psychological trick to say
[1:00:39] well lift your hands up let people won't
[1:00:41] raise their hands unless there's
[1:00:43] something motivating them to do it
[1:00:45] unless there's something whirling and
[1:00:47] pulsating telling them there's something
[1:00:49] that you're a needy people you know God
[1:00:50] made us and needy people just like Peter
[1:00:53] there in that boat God made us that way
[1:00:55] that we wouldn't need him he gave us a
[1:00:59] thirst that you would need something to
[1:01:01] quench that thirst he gave you that and
[1:01:05] there's only one thing that can quench
[1:01:07] that thirst and that's the word of God
[1:01:09] he's given the gospel call come come
[1:01:13] let's just bow our heads and go to the
[1:01:15] Lord in prayer Lord God well thank you
[1:01:20] Lord Jesus for your grace to us tonight
[1:01:22] and I believe that you're here Lord
[1:01:25] the building I believe it's your present
[1:01:27] Lord Jesus you promised that you would
[1:01:30] be a present help in time of need and in
[1:01:32] time of trouble I Peter there that boat
[1:01:34] you promised that you'd never leave us
[1:01:36] or forsake us that you go with us all
[1:01:38] the journey that you're to walk with us
[1:01:41] Lord Jesus Lord God I want to be like
[1:01:43] brother Branham in that story where he
[1:01:45] took a hold of that phone line and he
[1:01:47] never let go of that God let me be like
[1:01:50] that Lord Jesus if that's a listen and I
[1:01:52] could take the night let me never let go
[1:01:54] of that God and Lord you so all they
[1:01:57] uplifted hands tonight Lord Jesus
[1:01:58] sitting they raised their hand up to you
[1:02:00] because Lord God we know that we're
[1:02:03] needed Lord Jesus ever a hand lifted up
[1:02:06] Lord Jesus is a signal for my hearts
[1:02:08] Lord God that we need you Lord Jesus and
[1:02:11] I'm so thankful tonight Lord God to know
[1:02:13] that there is an answer for that need
[1:02:15] there's an answer for every trouble
[1:02:17] every trial Lord there's an answer for
[1:02:20] every wind and wave and you are that
[1:02:22] answer Lord Jesus and I pray God that
[1:02:25] you'll answer back Lord Jesus tonight
[1:02:27] we're not just not just a psychology or
[1:02:30] something that can be debated the Lord
[1:02:32] let us did not go from here presume and
[1:02:34] Lord Jesus but give us something Lord
[1:02:37] God that we know and I presume it
[1:02:39] anymore that we know that you're real
[1:02:41] that we know that there is a God in
[1:02:43] Israel that there is a God there is a
[1:02:46] balm in Gilead god I pray Lord that you
[1:02:49] let your every need for tonight Lord
[1:02:52] Jesus I pray O God that if there be any
[1:02:54] one Lord God the night Lord Jesus is
[1:02:56] struggling within himself Lord and
[1:02:59] thinking like I can't run up to an altar
[1:03:01] because everybody will see me Lord I
[1:03:04] pray God that you'll tear away that veil
[1:03:06] of tear away all that down and
[1:03:09] everything that's crushing them over and
[1:03:11] let them died of themselves and I Lord
[1:03:14] Jesus just give away we believe Lord God
[1:03:18] that you're still able that you're still
[1:03:20] the same God it was testified of it was
[1:03:23] written of in the Bible that these
[1:03:25] things that were spoken of the night are
[1:03:27] true and God I know lighting up
[1:03:30] convinced I'm assured I'm standing
[1:03:33] tonight that the word that's written on
[1:03:35] the
[1:03:36] this Bible it will produce in the lives
[1:03:39] of the believers if we let it
[1:03:41] God granted I pray that you will let it
[1:03:44] Lord Jesus let us die Lord God help us
[1:03:47] in the I - I see Lord Jesus Lord God I
