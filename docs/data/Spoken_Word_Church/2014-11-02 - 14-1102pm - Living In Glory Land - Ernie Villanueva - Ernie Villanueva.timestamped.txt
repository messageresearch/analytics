[2:09] you amen and amen and
[2:13] amen bless you I couldn't hear
[2:15] you praise the
[2:18] lord well praise God
[2:22] Amen you know when we when we come into
[2:26] yeah me
[2:28] too
[2:30] when you come into the house of God we
[2:32] should be able to take all of our cares
[2:34] all of our our problems and we can just
[2:37] deposit them at the back door and come
[2:40] in and and really when I come in you
[2:42] know I I expect the supernatural to take
[2:45] place when I and you know when I first
[2:48] got saved in a little Baptist Church and
[2:51] uh you know I was way in the back row of
[2:53] the balcony because I had never been in
[2:55] the Baptist Church before I'd come from
[2:57] the Catholic church and uh you know the
[3:00] whole the whole Baptist environment
[3:02] seemed a little bit strange to me there
[3:03] was no statues and no candles and you
[3:06] know no stained glass or anything so I'm
[3:09] way in the back row of the balcony and
[3:11] the preacher he preached God's Divine
[3:13] judgment for The Sinner and he was
[3:16] preaching out of second Corinthians and
[3:18] he said you know uh you know if God's
[3:22] for you who who can be against you and
[3:25] uh so you know as soon as he made that
[3:27] altar call everything inside of me
[3:30] wanted to go but you know nobody else
[3:33] was going and I wasn't going to be the
[3:34] only one down there so I was back the
[3:37] next week and he preached again and and
[3:39] that time you know he really he really
[3:42] struck pay dirt and and I didn't care
[3:44] when when he made the invitation I was
[3:46] like Jack in the Box I just popped out
[3:48] of that seat and went right down there
[3:50] and I'll never forget you know so naive
[3:53] I said uh I said is what you're saying
[3:55] here the truth that you know uh if any
[3:57] man is in Christ he's a new creature old
[3:59] things are passed away and All Things
[4:01] become new and God will separate your
[4:03] sins as far as the East is from the West
[4:05] to the sea of forgetfulness and and God
[4:07] will never never remember them and if
[4:09] God's for you who can be against you cuz
[4:11] I had written down all those notes and I
[4:13] had them right there and I said this
[4:15] this is this is what you know what what
[4:16] you said now I want to know is all this
[4:19] is all this how it works he says he says
[4:22] yes son I said so well I want to sign up
[4:25] cuz in the Catholic Church you had to
[4:26] sign up for everything so so I said I
[4:29] want sign up he says son he said nothing
[4:32] to sign up for he said we're just going
[4:33] to pray and I W I walked out of that
[4:36] that Baptist Church First Baptist of
[4:38] Winter Park Florida and I felt like a
[4:40] ton of bricks had been lifted off my
[4:42] shoulders and uh and and and you know
[4:44] the cigarettes went and alcohol went and
[4:47] uh you know I I I was just living in
[4:49] glory land and every time the doors were
[4:51] open I was there and they had a men's
[4:54] prayer breakfast at 6:00 in the morning
[4:56] I was there they had a uh Outreach
[4:59] meeting
[5:00] at on Monday I was there Tuesday was the
[5:03] young people's meeting then Wednesday
[5:04] was the midweek service then they had a
[5:07] a soup supper and every time they open
[5:09] the doors I was there and I I just
[5:10] couldn't get enough of it and uh and so
[5:15] so then you know I I I was I was still
[5:17] sitting in the back but I started moving
[5:19] up moving up moving up moving up and
[5:21] finally I I heard a oldtime preacher on
[5:24] the on the Bible he said when I go to
[5:26] church I want to be at at at the spout
[5:28] where the glory comes out and from then
[5:31] on I was front row anywhere I go I'm on
[5:34] the front row I don't want to be
[5:36] disturbed by anybody turning around or
[5:38] or lifting their children or picking
[5:40] their nose or whatever I don't want I
[5:42] don't want to be disturbed by any of
[5:43] that stuff I want to be right there and
[5:46] I want to be I want to be focused like a
[5:48] laser beam on what's coming from that
[5:50] pulpit and so so I expect the
[5:53] supernatural every time I come to church
[5:56] and I and and I trust that tonight that
[5:58] God will do something something or say
[6:00] something that that will inspire you to
[6:03] live a little bit closer and and uh you
[6:05] know get that get that that that seal
[6:08] tightened up you know real real tight so
[6:10] you are absolutely positive that you are
[6:14] going to have a safe arrival at that
[6:17] Port of Eternity amen God bless you um
[6:21] I'd like to have you turn in in your
[6:25] Bibles
[6:27] to First thess
[6:37] lonians we're going to read out of the
[6:39] second
[6:42] chapter 11th
[6:45] verse before we read let's
[6:49] pray
[6:51] father once again Lord we want to enter
[6:55] into that sweet Supernatural presence
[7:01] we want to come to the throne of
[7:04] grace with praise and thanksgiving in
[7:07] our
[7:08] hearts thanking you for the life that
[7:10] you've given us to live thanking you for
[7:14] the friends the brothers and sisters
[7:16] that have encouraged us to Long the
[7:19] way Lord we want to we want to be like
[7:22] you we want our hands to do what your
[7:25] hands would do and your feet our feet to
[7:28] be what your feet would do in our lips
[7:31] in our
[7:32] tongues to say the things that you would
[7:35] say so Lord I pray that you would take
[7:39] control of the service we committed into
[7:41] your
[7:43] hands bless your people father let let
[7:46] that great faith rise up in their hearts
[7:48] let the word be illuminated to their
[7:50] souls and help me Lord to move myself
[7:53] out of the way father and just say only
[7:56] what you would have said we ask these
[7:58] blessings and in your precious name our
[8:01] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[8:05] amen 1 Thessalonians 2nd chapter 11th
[8:09] verse as you know how we exhorted and
[8:13] comforted and charged every one of you
[8:15] as a father thus his children that ye
[8:18] would walk worthy of God who hath called
[8:20] you unto his kingdom and Glory now that
[8:24] word Kingdom it it it designates royalty
[8:28] so God has called us into a kingdom it's
[8:30] a Royal Kingdom and we are priests in in
[8:34] in that
[8:35] Kingdom into his kingdom and glory for
[8:38] this
[8:39] cause also thank we god without ceasing
[8:43] because when ye receed the word of God
[8:46] which you heard of us you received it
[8:48] not as the word of men but as it is in
[8:52] truth the word of God which effectively
[8:55] worketh also in you that believe amen
[8:59] God bless you and you can have your
[9:07] seats I know that everybody who who
[9:10] believes the message they they love to
[9:13] read and listen to what brother brandom
[9:16] has to say but every once in a while
[9:18] I'll I'll pick up a book and it'll be a
[9:20] book by uh you know I I I like to to
[9:24] read what Martin Luther had to say I
[9:26] like to read what John Wesley had to say
[9:29] and the experiences he went through and
[9:32] how he was out there trying to get souls
[9:34] saved and he met the people and and he
[9:37] found out that he wasn't he wasn't even
[9:38] saved himself and uh you know he was
[9:41] honest enough to to say that you know
[9:44] and he and and uh I love to to read
[9:48] Spurgeon Charles Spurgeon and I want to
[9:51] read something to you that that that he
[9:53] gave on a New Year's Eve service in
[9:56] other words a watch Night Service and
[9:59] and he used the scripture the Harvest is
[10:01] passed the summer is ended and we are
[10:04] not saved now can you imagine how
[10:06] Jeremiah felt when he when he had to say
[10:10] that to the children of Israel the
[10:12] Harvest is passed the summer is ended
[10:16] and we are not saved and and he gave
[10:19] this little exhortation just about a
[10:21] two-minute
[10:22] exhortation and he says uh and and i'
[10:26] like to you know exhort like I believe
[10:28] that char Spurgeon would would be
[10:31] exhorting and he starts off he said not
[10:34] saved dear reader is this your mournful
[10:38] plight warned of the judgment to come
[10:41] bidden to escape for your life and yet
[10:43] at this moment you are not saved you
[10:46] know the way of Salvation you read it in
[10:48] the Bible you hear it from the pulpit it
[10:51] is explained to you by friends and yet
[10:53] you neglect it and therefore you are not
[10:57] saved right you you will be without
[10:59] excuse when the Lord shall judge the
[11:02] quick and the dead the Holy Spirit has
[11:03] given more of less a blessing upon the
[11:06] word which has been preached in your
[11:08] hearing and Times of refreshing have
[11:11] come from the divine presence and yet
[11:14] you are without Christ all these hopeful
[11:17] seasons have come and gone your summer
[11:20] and your Harvest have passed and yet you
[11:23] are still not
[11:25] saved years have followed one another
[11:28] into eternity and your last year will
[11:31] soon be here youth has gone manhood is
[11:35] going and yet you are not saved and and
[11:39] and he's saying it like like you sh and
[11:41] still after all these things you are
[11:44] still not
[11:46] saved let me ask
[11:48] you will you ever be
[11:52] saved is there any likelihood of it
[11:55] already the most propitious seasons have
[11:58] left you unsaved will other occasions
[12:01] alter your condition means have failed
[12:04] with you the best of means use
[12:06] perseveringly and with the utmost
[12:09] affection what more can be done for you
[12:12] Affliction and prosperity have a light
[12:15] fail to impress you tears and prayers
[12:18] and sermons have been wasted on your
[12:20] Barren heart are not the probabilities
[12:23] dead against your ever being
[12:26] saved it is not more than likely that
[12:29] you will abide as you
[12:31] are till death forever bars The Door of
[12:35] Hope do you recoil from this supposition
[12:38] yet it is a most reasonable one he who
[12:42] is not washed in so many years will in
[12:46] all probability go filthy to his end the
[12:50] convenient time never has come why
[12:52] should it ever come it is logical to
[12:56] fear that it never will arrive and that
[12:58] that Felix like you will find no
[13:01] convenient season till you are in hell
[13:05] oh bethink you of what that is and of
[13:08] the dread probability that you will soon
[13:12] be cast into it now Spurgeon you know
[13:15] you can tell he's after Souls he's taken
[13:18] that soul and he's hanging it over the
[13:20] Flames of hell and you know this is
[13:22] shock preaching is is you know is what
[13:25] it was to me and he finishes he says
[13:27] reader suppose you should die unsaved
[13:31] your doom no man can even
[13:36] picture write out your dread estate in
[13:39] tears and blood talk of it with groans
[13:41] and nashing of teeth you will be
[13:44] punished with Everlasting destruction
[13:46] from the glory of the Lord and from the
[13:49] glory of his power a Brother's voice
[13:52] would Fain startle you into earnestness
[13:56] oh be wise be wise in time and a another
[14:00] year begins believe in Jesus who is able
[14:04] to save to the uttermost consecrate
[14:06] these last hours of this year to lonely
[14:10] thought and if deep repentance be bred
[14:14] in you it will be well and if it leads
[14:18] you to a humble faith in Jesus Christ it
[14:21] will be best of all oh see to it that
[14:24] this year passed not away and you still
[14:28] and un forgiven spirit let not the New
[14:30] Year's midnight peels sound upon a
[14:33] joyless spirit now now
[14:38] now and and and the third Now is really
[14:41] a big
[14:42] now believe and live and then he
[14:45] finishes he says Escape for thy life
[14:47] look not behind thee neither stay thou
[14:50] at in all the plain escape to the
[14:53] mountain lest thou be
[14:57] consumed you know you know things like
[14:59] like that those are the kind of
[15:01] preaching that I heard in the Baptist
[15:03] Church I had a I I had a a a preacher's
[15:06] name was JC Mitchell and if he was a
[15:08] fire brand and I loved it you know to me
[15:12] you know I had been cleaned of so many
[15:14] things and I was so ha I was just so
[15:16] happy to be free I was just so happy to
[15:19] know that I was on my way to heaven even
[15:21] though you know I was a nehy I I was a
[15:24] novice with the word but what I knew
[15:26] about the word I believed in the word
[15:28] word and I knew that whatever else I
[15:30] needed to know that God was going to
[15:33] lead me and every time every time when I
[15:36] left the Catholic Church my whole family
[15:38] I was talking to Brother Sam and sister
[15:40] Peggy last night and uh they were
[15:42] talking about you know somebody being
[15:44] you know real real Catholic I think
[15:46] sister Peggy said she saw a sign and
[15:48] somebody said I am 100% Catholic well I
[15:52] had a grandmother she was 200% Catholic
[15:55] and she walked around with her prayer
[15:57] beads all day long saying lay in the
[15:59] rosaries and uh when I left the Catholic
[16:01] church and uh you know and and she found
[16:04] out that I'd become a Protestant you
[16:06] know she was Ernie and I was her first
[16:08] grandson and you know there was a love
[16:10] between us and she said how can you
[16:13] leave the mother church and suffered
[16:16] that persecution then you know when I
[16:18] when I left the Baptist Church and went
[16:20] to the Assembly of God Church oh you
[16:22] know you're that that's all of the devil
[16:24] over there all that speaking in tongues
[16:26] and all all that stuff all that healing
[16:28] you know you know what I found out about
[16:30] the
[16:31] Baptist they don't have any problem
[16:33] praying for the sick as long as you
[16:36] don't get
[16:37] well see and and and and so then I was
[16:40] in the Assembly of God Church everything
[16:42] was going well and then I got heavily
[16:45] involved with the Full Gospel
[16:46] businessmen and I wound up at Jim
[16:48] Baker's Bible school down at PTL and and
[16:51] then you know I out of out of you know
[16:53] the Assembly of God and the Pentecostal
[16:55] charismatic movement I'm into the the up
[16:58] see and all my charismatic friends that
[17:01] oh you're you're an ult and you're
[17:04] you're a Jesus only and you're a Oneness
[17:06] and you know you're a legalist and you
[17:08] know all those things because every time
[17:12] I found new light I wanted to share it I
[17:15] wanted to take as many people who had
[17:17] helped me in in in that realm that they
[17:20] had brought me to and and God was
[17:22] showing me more light and I wanted to
[17:24] bring them with me but whether they were
[17:26] coming or not I was going right if I was
[17:29] all by myself I I was going and finally
[17:32] you know when when I when when I finally
[17:34] encountered the message and I tried to
[17:37] tell the UPC preacher oh my you you want
[17:41] to talk about fire and fury I mean he
[17:44] just blasted me with every kind of a
[17:47] reason why I should run as far away from
[17:50] this message as possible he said why he
[17:53] said don't you know brother brandom he
[17:55] he he tries to make the Bible a
[17:57] pornographic book you know what he talks
[18:00] about in in in in in in Genesis you know
[18:03] what he talks about in Genesis 3 he said
[18:06] what he said that's that's crazy you
[18:08] know and here's a guy who memorized he
[18:10] had the whole Bible memorized took him
[18:13] 16 years memorize the Bible preach like
[18:16] a machine gun and never even had to pick
[18:18] up the Bible and I would get his tape
[18:20] and I would listen to it every chapter
[18:22] every I mean every he would wrote
[18:24] chapters and he' go back to the Old
[18:26] Testament New Testament I mean I to this
[18:28] day I've never seen anybody preach with
[18:31] that kind of fire and accuracy but the
[18:34] sad thing is he was lost in Genesis 3
[18:37] right he never when he couldn't see
[18:39] Genesis 3 everything else he was off he
[18:43] was like you know Brother Sam was
[18:45] talking about you know taking a gun and
[18:47] and and you know sighting that that gun
[18:49] in well his gun got way off Genesis
[18:52] three gone now you know in in the state
[18:55] of
[18:56] Georgia I would I would guess there
[18:59] thousands and thousands maybe tens of
[19:02] thousands of churches in in in the state
[19:04] of Georgia and uh this morning there
[19:08] were pastors who got behind the sacred
[19:10] desk and they had they had prayed they'd
[19:13] studied they got some real good
[19:15] illustrations made some real good points
[19:18] and the people came and they expected
[19:20] that they were going to hear from a man
[19:21] of God so everything was set up and the
[19:24] man he preached his message and maybe
[19:27] the people rejoice shouted and you know
[19:29] went out went out to the you know H have
[19:31] some food after and so everything was
[19:34] fine and they thought their Sunday had
[19:36] just gone wonderfully they'd been in
[19:37] church they'd heard the word of God but
[19:40] of all the churches and all the sermons
[19:43] that were preached now I'm just talking
[19:44] about just in Georgia tens of thousands
[19:48] of sermons were
[19:49] preached but do you know not one not one
[19:54] person in all those sermons not one
[19:57] person
[19:58] ever receive the new birth not one
[20:03] unless it was a message church it's
[20:05] impossible I want to say it's impossible
[20:09] to receive the new birth outside of this
[20:13] message brother brandom said the only
[20:16] evidence that somebody truly has the
[20:19] Holy Ghost is that they can receive the
[20:22] message for their
[20:24] day and manifest the life that's the big
[20:29] key manifesting the life and and and
[20:32] often times the reason why people can't
[20:34] manifest the life is that they don't
[20:37] understands themselves people are
[20:39] confused they're frustrated you know
[20:43] the're they've got anxiety they've got
[20:45] fear they're they're afraid of the
[20:47] future and and now you know so many
[20:50] people they're trembling about Eboli and
[20:52] they're trembling about you know Isis
[20:54] over there and I mean they got so many
[20:57] things on their mind and the problem is
[21:00] they have sat in front of the pacifier
[21:02] called the television set they've sat in
[21:04] front of the pacifier too long and
[21:06] instead of being pacified whether it's
[21:09] CNN or Fox News or somebody you know I
[21:12] mean those people they believe in shock
[21:15] journalism oh yeah I mean to them when
[21:19] something when news comes in when a
[21:21] plane crashes or they have a shooting in
[21:23] some school man we got it you know we
[21:26] got we got headlines we got we got the
[21:29] audience our ratings are going to go up
[21:31] see and that's all they think
[21:34] about but we have to understand who we
[21:38] are and how we are wired and it took a
[21:41] prophet to tell us how we are wired C
[21:45] could we put that little uh little
[21:47] diagram up on the on the
[21:52] board you
[21:53] see brother brandom talked about us
[21:56] being a a Triune be being and uh you
[21:59] know a good illustration is like an egg
[22:02] now on the egg we can see the outside of
[22:05] the egg we can see the
[22:06] shell and by revelation we know that if
[22:09] you crack that egg you're going to see
[22:11] the egg yolk and you're going to see the
[22:14] egg white that they're going to be
[22:15] they're going to be there we know that
[22:17] now the human being is the same way we
[22:20] have got an outer we've got an outer
[22:23] shell and we've got our eyes our ears
[22:27] our taste touch smell now see your eyes
[22:32] what a precious gift eyesight is you
[22:35] know with your eyes you can behold the
[22:38] beauty of nature you can behold the
[22:40] beauty of a little child and and and how
[22:43] the child you know when they smile and
[22:45] when they make their first steps and
[22:47] everything is new to them everything is
[22:50] is exciting their imagination is going
[22:52] wild making new discoveries and we just
[22:55] look at that and we're able to enter
[22:57] into vicariously we can re we we can
[23:00] become like a little child our s when
[23:03] we're around the little children and so
[23:05] our eyes our eyes can behold the beauty
[23:08] of what's in the word our eyes can
[23:10] behold the beauty of what's in the in
[23:13] the message so our eyes can be used for
[23:16] so many things you can behold the beauty
[23:18] of Nature Flowers we have places up uh
[23:21] up in Vancouver bushart Gardens I mean
[23:24] it it looks like the Garden of Eden up
[23:27] there it's it's just so breathtaking and
[23:30] we can behold the beauty of of of of of
[23:32] of the moon sometimes when it comes down
[23:35] real close and when it gets full so
[23:38] there's so many things now I've got a
[23:40] friend of mine and he's blind and and he
[23:43] went blind in a in a hunting accident
[23:45] when he was N9 years old his name is
[23:47] Dick
[23:48] mailman and uh he's a preacher now he's
[23:51] a preacher down in Altamont Springs just
[23:53] outside of Orlando but when I met him we
[23:56] were in business together and and he was
[23:58] a speaker he was a motivational speaker
[24:00] a blind motivational speaker but the
[24:02] thing is he had had the sensation of
[24:05] seeing when he was a young child so he
[24:07] could move and you know and and and and
[24:09] he had a perception I mean he could turn
[24:12] he could be speaking to you and he'd
[24:14] turn around and he'd get that chalk and
[24:16] he go right on the chalkboard and people
[24:19] that guy's not blind they just put
[24:22] they're just telling us that he's not
[24:23] blind and so you know we spent a lot of
[24:26] time together and we had you know we had
[24:28] seminars that we were doing in Daytona
[24:30] Beach in Orlando and Tampa and then down
[24:33] in Palm Beach and often times when we
[24:35] were going I had the opportunity to
[24:38] drive and I mean I was like a sponge
[24:41] this guy had so much knowledge and so
[24:43] much insight into human nature and so I
[24:46] asked him one day I said dick I said I
[24:49] said you know you've had the sensation
[24:51] of seeing I said what would it be what
[24:53] would it be like for you if Medical
[24:56] Technology were ever able to advance to
[24:58] the point where you could see again and
[25:01] he said well Ernie he says uh he said
[25:03] you know I I I'd love to see again he
[25:05] said I've never seen my wife I have
[25:07] three children I've never seen my
[25:09] children I've never seen my dog I've
[25:11] never seen my house you know and he
[25:13] started name and all the things that he
[25:15] hadn't seen he said but he said there
[25:17] would be a danger there would be a
[25:19] danger if I could ever see again because
[25:23] he said I've known so many people and he
[25:27] says and they judge people like somebody
[25:30] says you can't judge a book by the cover
[25:33] he said well many people they judge your
[25:36] book by the cover he said right now he
[25:38] said when I meet somebody he said I
[25:40] don't know if that per you know maybe I
[25:42] can guess but I don't know if the person
[25:45] how old the person they may be 20 or
[25:47] they may be 40 they may be 50 or 60 I
[25:49] don't know he says I don't I don't know
[25:52] if the person is attractive or not
[25:54] attractive I don't know I don't know
[25:56] what color they are he said I don't know
[25:58] if they're short or tall he all these
[26:00] things I don't know he said but I have I
[26:03] I I have a perception he said I have a
[26:06] sense he said and and he called it you
[26:08] know he called it a secret sense I have
[26:10] a secret sense where if I'm around
[26:12] somebody for a few minutes he said I can
[26:15] feel whether or not this person is going
[26:18] to be somebody who is going to to be an
[26:22] asset to me somebody who's going to be a
[26:24] blessing to me somebody that I can
[26:26] fellowship with somebody that we're
[26:28] going to have good companionship or
[26:31] whether it's somebody that you know
[26:34] maybe not you know maybe I should just
[26:36] keep my distance from this person and he
[26:38] said and I would hate to ever have to go
[26:42] to the point where just because I had my
[26:44] eyes back I would prejudge people and he
[26:47] said and maybe because because of their
[26:50] age or because of the way they look or
[26:53] or or whatever he said I may prejudge
[26:56] that person and there may be a beautiful
[27:00] kernel of love in that person that God
[27:03] wants to bless me with and yet I might
[27:05] miss it because oh they're too old H
[27:09] they're not attractive you know I
[27:11] mean they're what have I got to be you
[27:15] know attracted to that person by and so
[27:18] a lot of people they judge and and they
[27:21] misuse their eyes and many people they
[27:23] misuse their eyes they read the wrong
[27:26] things they read the wrong magazines
[27:29] they read the wrong books they watch
[27:30] television they go to movies magazines
[27:33] Sports you know that's their end all
[27:36] Beall you know what the Georgia Bulldogs
[27:38] did this week or or what the Atlanta
[27:41] Falcons did you know or or going to do
[27:44] and uh you know every state is like that
[27:47] last year we had Seahawk Mania up in
[27:51] Washington I mean you you couldn't go
[27:53] anywhere and and you know they've got a
[27:56] thing where the the stadium it rocks you
[27:59] know and and and they've set world
[28:01] records for having the loudest stadium
[28:04] the loudest fans in there and and then
[28:07] Kansas City they went back and forth
[28:09] well they call that the 12th man now I
[28:12] don't know you know football doesn't
[28:14] interest me at all but if you're if
[28:16] you're living in Washington you know
[28:18] what the 12th man is and everywhere you
[28:21] go you got people with their jerseys on
[28:24] Seahawks Journey 12 man you go there
[28:27] they got automobiles 12 everything is 12
[28:29] 12 12 12 12 now if you just went into
[28:32] Washington you went from New York or
[28:35] somewhere and you went you say what in
[28:37] the world are all these twelves about
[28:39] but if you live there you know what it's
[28:41] all about so people you know they give
[28:44] thems over to TV stars movie stars
[28:48] sports stars rock stars business Stars
[28:53] political stars but I can tell you one
[28:55] thing without the holy ho ghost they're
[28:58] all fallen stars and yet people give
[29:01] their time and they give their attention
[29:03] and they give their money and their
[29:05] resources and they take their children
[29:08] and they sacrifice their children on the
[29:11] altar of entertainment and they make
[29:13] their children a sports fan they make
[29:16] their children a music fan or what
[29:19] whatever is you know whatever Mom and
[29:20] Dad are interested in they're passing
[29:23] down to their children whether they know
[29:25] it or not because children are very very
[29:28] perceptive so our eyes are a wonderful
[29:32] gift that can be used or it can be
[29:36] abused I'm so thankful that I've got
[29:39] eyes to see and now we go to our ears
[29:41] we've got ears to hear and think of all
[29:44] the wonderful things that we can do with
[29:47] our ears the things we hear the singing
[29:50] the in the church today was wonderful I
[29:53] love hearing people sing good songs
[29:56] music anointed songs I love being able
[30:00] to communicate with people I would hate
[30:02] to have to you know be deaf and have to
[30:04] everything be going like this or going
[30:07] like you know I I I I see up in New York
[30:10] in in New York City Anytime they have
[30:12] any kind of a government a government uh
[30:15] meeting they always have a signer there
[30:18] they have like the governor or the mayor
[30:20] or whoever he is and they always have
[30:22] you know the the uh the fans in the back
[30:26] there all the people that to be seen in
[30:28] the background and then they got the
[30:29] signer and the sign and you know I
[30:31] appreciate the fact but I am so thankful
[30:33] that I've got ears but many people they
[30:36] misuse their ears they misuse their ears
[30:40] by listening to gossip listening to the
[30:42] wrong things listening to the wrong
[30:45] music and also all of the entertainment
[30:48] and all the the uh the educational
[30:51] programs that that that that that are
[30:53] presented to them they don't put a
[30:55] filter on their ears
[30:57] now brother brandham said nothing wrong
[30:59] with education but many people will make
[31:02] education a God and they cannot get
[31:05] enough they cannot get enough seminars
[31:07] they cannot get enough insight into
[31:09] what's going on in politics and you know
[31:12] in the next couple of days you know the
[31:14] the the the uh the the TV news headlines
[31:17] I mean it's going to be just working on
[31:19] overtime who's going to win is it the
[31:22] Republicans is it the Democrats this
[31:24] state here it's at a razor thin margin
[31:27] here you know and they're spending so
[31:28] many millions of dollars and they got
[31:30] the you know it's it's bizarre I want to
[31:33] tell you when I was in North Carolina I
[31:36] walked into a print shop and when I
[31:38] walked into the print shop i s sit at
[31:40] the counter and I looked up there and
[31:41] the guy had a big giant Banner in the
[31:44] banner it said politics and he had it p
[31:47] o l i hyphen TI I Cs and underneath it
[31:51] it said poly means many ticks means
[31:56] parasites so politics equals many
[32:00] parasites all feeding from the public
[32:03] door see and and yet people get so they
[32:06] get so riled up you know I'm a Democrat
[32:09] I was born a Democrat I'm going to die a
[32:11] Democrat I was born a republican I'm
[32:13] going die Republican other words I'm
[32:15] independent you know I'm I don't go
[32:18] either way or I'll go both ways you know
[32:20] whatever it is and so we've got to watch
[32:23] listen now we've got to watch what goes
[32:25] into our eyes or ears because once you
[32:28] make a conscious decision to allow
[32:31] something into your eyes or ears it
[32:33] takes a journey to the back road of your
[32:35] mind and there in the back road of your
[32:38] mind is produced
[32:40] thoughts sometimes hundreds of thoughts
[32:44] while you're watching a movie or while
[32:45] you're watching you know the news
[32:48] thoughts and those thoughts they become
[32:50] words we hear it and then we repeat it
[32:53] you know the average person the average
[32:56] person has 10,000 thoughts a day go
[33:01] through their mind but you know what the
[33:03] problem is
[33:05] 9,000 plus of those thoughts that go
[33:09] through your mind today are the same
[33:11] 9,000 thoughts that went through your
[33:13] mind yesterday it's like your your mind
[33:16] is like it's on a loop you're worried
[33:19] about the bills worried about the kids
[33:21] worried about school worry about the and
[33:23] those thoughts go round and round and
[33:25] round and round and
[33:27] so you when it comes in your eyes or
[33:29] ears it it goes to your mind it produces
[33:32] a thought thoughts produce words words
[33:35] produce actions actions form habits
[33:38] habits produces character and character
[33:41] determines your destiny so we've got to
[33:43] watch our eyes and watch our our ears
[33:46] and then we come to our taste and and
[33:49] our smell and uh I did I didn't know it
[33:52] until yesterday I I was talking to
[33:54] Brother Sam and I gave him something
[33:56] that I Ed to to kind of clean out my
[33:58] sinuses once in a while and he said well
[34:00] I can't smell and I didn't know it I
[34:02] didn't know that but but I do know there
[34:05] are many people who cannot smell and
[34:07] there are many people believe it or not
[34:09] they cannot taste medicine sometimes has
[34:13] caused them to lose their taste buds or
[34:16] different things have have happened to
[34:18] them so ice cream tastes like potatoes
[34:21] or potatoes taste like you know it it's
[34:22] all the same they just eat they eat
[34:24] because they have to eat to live right
[34:27] but they can't taste it could you
[34:29] imagine could you imagine eating and not
[34:31] being able to taste good food and yet
[34:35] there are some PE so so we are blessed
[34:38] with our sense of smell we are blessed
[34:40] with our sense of of of of of taste I
[34:44] love the tast I I I love ethnic food I
[34:47] love Chinese food Japanese food thai
[34:49] food Mexican food Italian food Greek
[34:52] food you know I I love it all I've got a
[34:55] missionary stomach I I I just love any I
[34:59] can eat anything except
[35:01] liver oh my and I was in the Philippines
[35:05] one time and and they had a soup and the
[35:08] soup was delicious and I was eating that
[35:10] soup and all of a sudden I took a bite
[35:12] of something it was and I mean I have no
[35:15] control over it but if liver goes to my
[35:18] taste buds it automatically ejects my
[35:22] body rejects it and the food comes it
[35:25] ejects and I have to hurry up and try to
[35:27] catch it you know in a napkin or in my
[35:29] hands or something to avoid a big
[35:31] embarrassment so so our taste and our
[35:33] smell that they they're gifts we don't
[35:36] you know we don't we don't say Lord
[35:38] thank you for my sense of taste thank
[35:40] you for my sense of smell you know thank
[35:42] you for my eyes thank you for my ears
[35:44] but these are all gifts and some people
[35:46] are blind some people are deaf some
[35:48] people can't smell some people can't
[35:50] taste and then there are people and then
[35:53] we we go to the sensation of our touch
[35:57] now it's wonderful you know when when
[36:00] you're in love and and you have your
[36:02] sweetheart and you want to hold hands or
[36:04] you want to you know just walk down the
[36:07] you know the street you know and and
[36:08] just have a good conversation and you
[36:11] know many other things go with the
[36:12] benefits of of being married but other
[36:16] people they abuse their sense of touch
[36:20] and Satan has anointed them and anointed
[36:23] their sensation of touch and and and
[36:26] they use it and basically it just
[36:29] becomes raw Heathen lust is what it
[36:32] becomes and they want to go out with
[36:35] this one for a while and then go out
[36:36] with this one for a while and go out you
[36:38] know I want to touch this one I want to
[36:40] touch that one I want to be with this
[36:41] one and and so these are all the you
[36:44] know I say our shell our our our
[36:49] eggshell but now that's just the first
[36:52] part of who we are and many people you
[36:55] know that's basically
[36:57] what governs their life if it looks good
[37:00] they want to look at it if it sounds
[37:02] good they want to listen to it if it
[37:04] tastes and smells good they want to eat
[37:06] it and a lot of times they eat you know
[37:10] and gets in trouble they get them
[37:12] themselves in trouble and they wind up
[37:14] with you know with sicknesses and
[37:16] illnesses and diseases I I know a
[37:19] brother precious brother a brother I
[37:22] love been in this church many times we
[37:24] Fellowship all the time but this brother
[37:27] he's got sugar
[37:29] diabetes and he cannot control his taste
[37:34] buds he loves sugar even though he knows
[37:38] it's destroying his body his legs are
[37:41] literally turning black he's had a heart
[37:43] attack he's had a stroke and he's got a
[37:46] big church one of the biggest churches
[37:47] in the Philippines and everybody his
[37:50] wife his brother who's also a pastor his
[37:53] children all of them you know the
[37:56] deacons of of his church you know they
[37:57] they try to you know go with him when he
[37:59] eats and when he goes and he orders that
[38:01] hot fudge Sunday you know they try to
[38:04] they try to put the stop on it but he he
[38:06] won't hear he knows he knows it's
[38:09] detrimental to him but he is so
[38:11] Bound by that taste sensation and some
[38:15] people are bound by the touch sensation
[38:18] see and so you know if it feels good
[38:21] they want to do it yeah so so basically
[38:25] just as a review you if it looks good
[38:28] look at it if it sounds good they want
[38:31] to listen to it smells good tastes good
[38:33] they want to they want to eat it feels
[38:35] good want to do it and those are people
[38:38] who live after the flesh they are
[38:41] governed after the flesh this is the
[38:44] first realm and the first realm it's not
[38:47] a royal realm and I can tell you with
[38:51] with with with wi with all sincerity you
[38:53] are only as safe as the realm or the
[38:58] domain that you choose to live
[39:01] in and you've got to bring that you know
[39:05] many people they think well you know I'm
[39:07] a human being and I've come to Earth to
[39:09] have a spiritual experience that's not
[39:11] right you believe it or not you are a
[39:14] supernatural being and you've come to
[39:16] Earth to have a human
[39:19] experience and and your mission your
[39:22] mandate in life is to overcome that
[39:25] Human Experience is overcome your eyes
[39:28] ears taste touch and smell so you so so
[39:32] you you're in control so now let's go
[39:34] into the second realm we go into the
[39:37] realm of the mind and and in the mind
[39:40] the first one is your conscience now I
[39:43] am so thankful if if all this message
[39:46] did for for all of us was to give us a
[39:49] revelation of justification and the Sea
[39:52] of God's forgetfulness but I mean we are
[39:55] eons of miles ahead of anybody in any
[40:00] other church because you know their
[40:03] salvation usually last from one service
[40:05] to the next service and sometime from
[40:08] Sunday to Monday you know and right away
[40:11] they're back you know you know people
[40:13] they they are anybody ever had a bad
[40:16] boss work with a bad boss you know what
[40:18] the worst boss is it's a bad
[40:22] habit and bad habits get you in trouble
[40:25] and people you know they they they do it
[40:28] to themselves they they make choices
[40:30] they make decisions that they know are
[40:32] destructive they know they've done it in
[40:34] the past but they want to do it again
[40:36] and so I I compare it to a guy who gets
[40:38] a rope and he ties two loops around the
[40:40] rope and one Loop he ties here the other
[40:43] one he ties here and he just starts
[40:44] kicking himself every day he goes out
[40:47] and he makes the same mistake that he
[40:49] made yesterday I know I shouldn't do it
[40:51] but I'm going to do it anyways I know I
[40:53] shouldn't be here but I'm going anyways
[40:55] you know I know I shouldn't go to the
[40:57] movie show but you know I just want to
[40:59] this one movie I want to see see and so
[41:01] they beat themsel up this a guy one time
[41:05] he said it was a general he said we have
[41:08] identified the
[41:10] enemy and he is
[41:14] me so we don't want to be our own enemy
[41:18] we want the Holy Ghost to to to to be
[41:20] our friend and the Holy Ghost to govern
[41:23] us and and and so in the mind and the
[41:25] conscience real
[41:26] your conscience it can be so clean and
[41:29] so clear because the purity of a word
[41:34] has has has has called you out and
[41:37] selected you to be one of the few who
[41:42] can receive true
[41:45] justification true freedom from all Sin
[41:49] from all guilt from all shame from all
[41:52] condemnation and you can walk with a
[41:55] bounce in your step you can walk and say
[41:58] I got the token you know I packed the
[41:59] token in me you know and and you know I
[42:02] say that all the time so thankful for
[42:04] the token so thankful for the token and
[42:07] when I talk to my mom I talk to my my
[42:10] sisters I talk to my relative I want
[42:12] that token to be on display I want to be
[42:15] like David he says I place the lord
[42:17] always before me always before me what I
[42:20] say I want the Lord I the Lord is with
[42:23] me I want the Lord to be able to walk
[42:25] with me I want the Lord to be able to
[42:27] talk and be able to be pleased with what
[42:29] I say and so other people it's the the
[42:33] the Devil comes and the devil brings up
[42:36] your past he brings up all the mistakes
[42:39] you've ever made and so I I encourage
[42:41] people and I might have said this before
[42:44] might have probably did but I encourage
[42:46] people to get a notepad and and you got
[42:49] to get a not pad and you got to get a
[42:51] shovel and you got to get a match and
[42:54] you got to get a rock and some red paint
[42:58] and a paintbrush okay now the first
[43:00] thing you do is you write down all your
[43:02] sins all your mistakes all your failures
[43:05] all your disappointments all the
[43:07] rejection all the hatred bigotry

[44:11] Doubt try to come and assault you and
[44:14] bring up your past you say Satan you are
[44:17] a liar I've got a prophet word that says
[44:21] I'm free I got a prophet word that says

[44:29] so devil start
[44:31] trembling just start trembling you know
[44:34] did did do you ever take that seriously
[44:37] that in that realm that's all around us
[44:40] you know Satan Satan or or his imps they
[44:43] are listening to everything that you say
[44:47] I don't know if they got if they got a
[44:49] supernatural uh uh computer that keeps
[44:52] track of of everything you say and
[44:54] everything you do but they're listening
[44:56] and if you start talking about your
[44:58] weaknesses or your fears or your
[45:01] anxieties or your problem oh that's a
[45:04] good one write that one down we can use
[45:06] that one then they'll go and they'll get
[45:08] two or three or four more imps and
[45:09] they'll come and you can feel you can
[45:12] feel that presence when they come and
[45:14] they try to get a sneak attack on you oh
[45:16] yeah and the thing you need to do is
[45:18] stand when you've done all the stand
[45:20] just stand you know the devil he the
[45:23] devil can't make me raise my arm the
[45:26] devil can't make me do
[45:29] anything we choose to do it choice
[45:32] choice is one of the greatest powers
[45:35] that God has put into the hands of a
[45:37] human being you've got a choice you've
[45:40] got a choice to go to prayer you've got
[45:42] a choice to put on a a CD or a DVD or or
[45:46] any one of the other channels that we've
[45:48] got to listen to the message now you've
[45:50] got a choice if you want if you got a
[45:52] choice to go and witness of somebody all
[45:56] these things are choices every one of us
[45:58] has got 24 hours in a day nobody gets 23
[46:02] nobody gets 25 it's what we do with
[46:05] those hours it's the choices and
[46:08] decisions and those choices and
[46:10] decisions they become either Positive
[46:12] Choices or negative choices positive
[46:16] decisions or negative decisions and
[46:18] there are consequences to each one often
[46:21] time you know many time brother brandom
[46:23] talked about the sin of om
[46:26] it's not that you went out and committed
[46:28] the sin it's that you didn't do what God
[46:31] opened up a door for you to do or you
[46:33] felt that nudge of the Holy Ghost and
[46:35] yet we didn't do it so now that's our
[46:37] conscience okay now we go to the next
[46:40] compartment it's like we go to the next
[46:41] floor and the next floor it's our
[46:45] imagination our imagination is one of
[46:48] the greatest and most powerful gifts
[46:51] that we've that that you could ever
[46:53] imagine you know you look at the
[46:54] skyscraper you know in downtown Atlanta
[46:58] or if you go to New York City all those
[47:00] buildings they were they were in
[47:02] somebody's mind all the engineering that
[47:05] had to be done all the wiring that had
[47:08] to be done all all the phones that had
[47:11] to be put in I mean it's just amazing
[47:13] all the plumbing that had to be done and
[47:16] somebody just sat down and somebody just
[47:18] wrote it down somebody designed it and
[47:20] they gave it to somebody who was a
[47:22] contractor contract okay I can do that
[47:24] and he goes there he gets the workers
[47:26] and the workers start digging or they
[47:28] bring in the equipment next thing you
[47:29] know there's a hole in the ground and
[47:31] the walls start going up and the floors
[47:33] start going up and next thing you know
[47:35] you know it's for rent you know come on
[47:37] in do your business here and it's
[47:40] incredible you see the boats that they
[47:42] build oh my it's just amazing some of
[47:44] these battleships they it was in
[47:46] somebody's mind before it was ever in
[47:48] the water so so our our our imagination
[47:51] I call mine the station of Creation in
[47:55] my imagination it's a dream machine see
[47:58] your imag and and you got to exercise
[48:02] your imagination right exercise it in
[48:06] things that are good and true and holy
[48:09] and positive things that are going to be
[48:12] a blessing to you and to other people
[48:16] see and so other people they use their
[48:19] imagination and I mean the devil uses
[48:22] their imagination and they watch so much
[48:25] television and movies and and they get
[48:27] so many video games and they're sitting
[48:30] there sometime you know sometimes
[48:31] they've said people have sat in front of
[48:33] those video machines for like 48 hours
[48:36] straight just doing nothing but playing
[48:38] those and they got they got places for
[48:41] people who who like to have people for
[48:43] for drug rehabilitation or alcohol
[48:45] rehabilitation they've got people who
[48:47] have to go to internet Rehabilitation
[48:50] because they can't pull them themselves
[48:51] out from behind the computer and their
[48:54] mind they don't have have any social
[48:56] skills they're socially awkward when
[48:58] they try to interact with human being
[49:01] because they're so used to interacting
[49:03] with the computer interacting with the
[49:05] mouse interacting boom boom boom boom
[49:07] boom boom shoot him shoot them kill him
[49:08] kill them kill them you know and oh my I
[49:11] killed 25 today I'm going to kill more
[49:14] tomorrow and so it's like they're
[49:16] they're actually their mind and Google
[49:18] is coming up you know I I I hear these
[49:20] Google Glasses I don't know how they
[49:22] work but I can tell you I don't want any
[49:24] part of it I don't want to go into a
[49:27] alternate reality I'm happy with the
[49:29] supernatural reality that God has given
[49:32] to me see and so your imagination it can
[49:36] be used positively or negatively I want
[49:40] to use mine for God I see because the
[49:44] the the the the the realm the domain the
[49:46] dimension that we're going into it's a
[49:48] supernatural Dimension and I want to
[49:51] practice I want to pract somebody said
[49:53] practice makes perfect I said no know
[49:55] perfect practice makes perfect right and
[49:58] I want to practice perfectly what the
[50:01] world that we're going into is going to
[50:03] be a faith civilization so I want my
[50:06] faith to grow I want my I want to
[50:09] meditate you know I start meditating and
[50:12] sometimes we have our mind has to be
[50:14] quickened to the fact like I'll Quicken
[50:16] you to a fact many of us maybe never
[50:18] thought of it but right now in this
[50:20] building there are supernatural angels
[50:23] in this building right now
[50:26] brother brandom said they're here to
[50:28] help out in the meetings right and
[50:31] brother BR said when you feel when that
[50:33] sweet presence comes in when the
[50:35] anointing comes in you know and people
[50:37] get to the point where almost drunk in
[50:39] the spirit and brother brand said that's
[50:41] Angels we're brushing up against angels
[50:45] unaware we're not aware of it but by a
[50:49] prophet's word we know and and I welcome
[50:51] the angels that are in this building I
[50:53] pray that they will do and and have have
[50:55] free Liberty to do whatever it is that
[50:58] they want to do with each one of us okay
[51:02] so now that's our
[51:04] imagination the next one we go to
[51:07] conscience
[51:09] imagination reasoning you know so many
[51:13] people they get trapped because they
[51:16] want to understand everything Brother P
[51:19] there's no way you can understand God if
[51:22] you could understand him you wouldn't
[51:23] need faith and so by faith we by faith
[51:27] we believe God by faith we understand
[51:30] the Promises by faith we understand that
[51:33] that Bible with 66 books with 40 40
[51:36] different authors Wroten uh you know so
[51:39] many years apart I forget how many years
[51:41] a part of this but it all just comes
[51:44] together it fits like a
[51:46] glove so people say I got to figure it
[51:49] out well you know the Bible says the
[51:52] Bible says cast down reasoning right
[51:54] cast down down memory cast down
[51:57] imagination cast down everything that
[52:00] exalted itself against the knowledge of
[52:03] God now don't cast down your memory or
[52:06] your imagination if it's positive if
[52:09] it's
[52:10] productive and then we we have the realm
[52:13] of of our affections you have the realm
[52:16] of your affection and that's such a
[52:17] beautiful thing a beautiful thing you
[52:21] know I heard somebody talking talking
[52:23] about love and they were talking about
[52:25] puppy
[52:26] love anybody ever experienced puppy love
[52:29] when you were young I did I did you know
[52:34] what they say about puppy they say life
[52:35] is one fool thing after another and
[52:38] puppy love is two fool things Chas
[52:40] chasing each other
[52:43] see and and so affections can be
[52:47] wonderful exhilarating
[52:49] intoxicating I mean you know all as you
[52:52] can see all you can see is the one if
[52:54] it's true if it's holy if it's if it's
[52:57] God pointing out to you this is this is
[53:00] this is the one that I prepared for you
[53:02] my there's no feeling like that in the
[53:06] whole world it's a revelation that God
[53:08] gives you see my Revelation is that
[53:12] Christ is my bridegroom and and my my
[53:15] bridegroom my husband has never made a
[53:19] mistake how many of you can say that how
[53:21] many of you ladies that are married can
[53:23] say that my husband never made a
[53:26] mistake well you just have to override
[53:28] the first
[53:29] one and go to the Eternal one he never
[53:32] he never made a mistake now now now here
[53:35] how many can remember how many can
[53:38] remember the first time you ever got
[53:41] your
[53:42] heartbroken you were just head over
[53:45] heels in love there's nobody like her
[53:48] there's nobody like him I'm so lucky I'm
[53:52] so blessed I'm so fortunate this is like
[53:54] the world oh I just can't believe I
[53:57] can't believe that he loves me I can't
[53:59] believe that she loves me and then all
[54:01] of a sudden the day
[54:04] comes and he comes in he said I got to
[54:07] talk to you or she comes in I got to
[54:09] talk to you said uh I believe we need to
[54:13] go our separate way I I I I believe we
[54:16] need to take some time I believe we need
[54:18] a little
[54:21] space in other words what they're saying
[54:24] and and what it finally comes to is I
[54:26] don't want you anymore I don't need you
[54:29] anymore and and you know what it feels
[54:32] like it feels like somebody took your
[54:33] heart and they took your heart and they
[54:36] ripped it out of your chest and they
[54:38] threw it on the ground and then they
[54:40] spit on it and then they stopped on it
[54:44] they said I don't love you anymore I
[54:47] don't want you anymore I don't want to
[54:49] see you anymore I don't want to hear
[54:51] about you
[54:52] anymore oh I can't believe
[54:55] my world's coming to an end oh you have
[54:58] your poor me party woe is me nobody's
[55:02] got it so rough as me nobody's ever felt
[55:05] like this before I'm never going to be
[55:08] the same oh it's a big one it's a big
[55:12] one you know and then you know they go
[55:15] into their bedroom and they lock their
[55:17] door and they shut off the lights and
[55:20] they laid down am I speaking anybody
[55:23] remember that those days I've been
[55:25] through it a few
[55:27] times and you know I've caused it a few
[55:29] times too and you know at that time you
[55:32] know I wasn't I wasn't a Christian I was
[55:34] carnal all I cared about was what was
[55:36] going to make me happy you know and just
[55:39] so happens that she doesn't make me
[55:42] happy anymore so she's got to go and
[55:44] I'll find another one
[55:47] yeah and so they hide in the room and
[55:51] Mom and Dad try to come in and reason
[55:53] with them oh there'll be another one one
[55:55] and then the old oh there's a lot of
[55:57] fish in the sea you
[55:59] know that's going to
[56:02] help all as you can see is one fish in
[56:04] the sea and that fish just slipped off
[56:07] the hook and swam
[56:08] away
[56:11] he and so you know Godly affection or
[56:15] heartbreak affection it depends upon
[56:18] what you set your heart on the Bible
[56:21] said set your heart on things above
[56:25] right that's where we need to set our
[56:28] our desires on have have have strong
[56:31] desire but let them be Supernatural
[56:34] desires spiritual desires things that
[56:37] that that that when they come to pass
[56:40] are going to be a positive a positive
[56:43] move in the right direction a positive
[56:45] move towards Christ a positive move
[56:48] towards the cross a positive move
[56:51] towards becoming the person that God
[56:54] designed us to be but we've got to
[56:57] understand those things and some you
[56:59] know they say the problem with with with
[57:03] youth is that is wasted on the
[57:06] young you know I would love I I would
[57:09] give everything those of you who are
[57:11] young here today uh those of you who are
[57:14] 30 years and under I'll say you know
[57:17] anybody who gets up to you know up to 60
[57:20] and 70 if we had the opportunity we
[57:25] would give everything that we have all
[57:29] our possessions all our belongings if I
[57:32] could just go back and be 18 years old
[57:35] again or 20 years old again just just
[57:38] give me the clothes on my back just give
[57:40] me a little apartment and a beat up car
[57:43] and let me start all over again but I
[57:46] need to I need to retain the knowledge
[57:49] that I have now at 60 years old I need
[57:52] to retain the knowledge but I want a
[57:55] young body I want to go back and be able
[57:57] to live it over we don't get that chance
[58:00] friends but through years we we gain
[58:03] experience we gain
[58:05] knowledge we know what's right we know
[58:08] what's wrong and and we understand God
[58:11] you know if a person follows the Bible
[58:13] and and and is dedicated to Christ you
[58:16] know that each step along the way it it
[58:20] it just you know you you're able to
[58:22] comprehend things at a much higher level
[58:25] at a level that young people could never
[58:28] understand but they're growing and and
[58:31] and and we are examples to them the
[58:33] young people are watching us they're
[58:35] watching brother Dale they're watching
[58:37] sister Dale they're watching the deacons
[58:39] they're watching the trustees they're
[58:41] watching you know brothers and sisters
[58:44] see and and so our
[58:47] affections oh my how we need to guard
[58:50] those
[58:52] affections we are the only people in the
[58:55] world who can set our
[58:57] affections on the message we're the only
[59:00] people in the world who understand the
[59:02] seven Church ages understand the Seven
[59:05] Seals we're the only people in the world
[59:08] who know what the future home of the
[59:10] Heavenly bride and bridegroom is we're
[59:13] the only ones who can understand the
[59:15] anointed ones at the end time could you
[59:18] imagine if God had not had brother
[59:20] Brandon preached that message and we'd
[59:22] be saying well I don't understand that
[59:24] they got signs wonders Miracles and
[59:26] people are getting healed and and they
[59:28] could be over Africa where brother
[59:29] brandham said they could make tables
[59:31] levitate and make the pen just jump up
[59:33] in the air and write something down with
[59:35] a pen nobody touching the pen the pen
[59:37] would just write down and it be true how
[59:39] could we understand those
[59:42] things but Satan you know Satan is not
[59:44] afraid of the supernatural Satan
[59:47] operates in the Supernatural he's a
[59:50] supernatural
[59:51] being and he's had 6,000 years him and
[59:55] all of his fallen angels have had 6,000
[59:59] years practicing how to pollute your
[1:00:03] your imagination and your conscience and
[1:00:06] your memory and your reasons and your
[1:00:09] affections so now we go to the last one
[1:00:13] for me it's the most precious one it's
[1:00:16] our
[1:00:17] memory and you know when you think on
[1:00:19] what God has done when you think on on
[1:00:23] how in 1906 six God had a plan and he
[1:00:26] planted that prophet in in in in in
[1:00:29] Kentucky and he raised them up and we
[1:00:32] can meditate on all the experiences that
[1:00:35] he had and how God had to teach him
[1:00:37] lessons sometimes hard lessons even to
[1:00:41] the point where you know where he was
[1:00:42] going to commit suicide you know going
[1:00:44] to take a hold of that pole even times
[1:00:47] when because of his anger he that guy
[1:00:49] that poisoned his dog he he had the gun
[1:00:52] getting ready to shoot that guy and the
[1:00:54] gun wouldn't fire later on it fired
[1:00:56] perfectly and brother Brandon because he
[1:00:58] was poor because he wore the same coat
[1:01:01] every day he was he was bullied in
[1:01:03] school and the kids picked on him and
[1:01:05] one day he had enough and he got his gun
[1:01:08] and he hid behind the bushes and he
[1:01:10] waited for the gang that was bullying
[1:01:11] him and he jumped out he said Okay who
[1:01:13] wants to die
[1:01:15] first and the gun wouldn't fire my I
[1:01:19] mean just so many things what he had to
[1:01:21] go through with his W with his first
[1:01:23] wife and how he lost his little girl and
[1:01:27] how Satan came he said are you still
[1:01:29] going to serve him after he took your
[1:01:32] wife he took your little girl and and
[1:01:35] are you still going to serve him and you
[1:01:37] know I mean that was a b the greatest
[1:01:39] battle ever fought for him at that point
[1:01:42] in time but he had to think back for all
[1:01:46] the things that God had done for him all
[1:01:49] the promises that are in the word all
[1:01:51] things work together for good for those
[1:01:53] that love God
[1:01:55] unfortunately there are people you know
[1:01:57] there are going to be people in my
[1:01:59] church this year that won't be there
[1:02:02] next year some are just going to leave
[1:02:05] some are going to backslide some are
[1:02:07] going to die you know they're not going
[1:02:08] to be there and so I want to appreciate
[1:02:12] people while they're here and I've got
[1:02:14] such Precious Memories you know every
[1:02:17] once in a while I just push my memory
[1:02:19] button and I go back and I just think
[1:02:22] about my own testimony how I got from
[1:02:25] the Catholic Church to the message and
[1:02:29] how I had to to meet brother Arie and
[1:02:32] what I had to go through and that whole
[1:02:34] and I just I just relive it in the
[1:02:36] imagination I relive it sitting in
[1:02:38] brother Bear's living room and brother
[1:02:40] Arie going out there and coming back and
[1:02:43] wanting to preach the message to to him
[1:02:45] and had to go out there and and get on
[1:02:48] you know get on the highway and just so
[1:02:50] angry and and have him get out of the
[1:02:52] car and get on the bus leave me alone
[1:02:54] with I mean you know crazy I mean you
[1:02:57] know if I wrote a book and asked
[1:02:59] somebody to believe that they wouldn't
[1:03:01] believe it totally supern God was doing
[1:03:05] that amen and I'm so thankful that I I I
[1:03:08] came through the way that I did but you
[1:03:11] know I I mean my pastor when I when I
[1:03:14] told my pastor brother bisco when I was
[1:03:16] moving up to Cloverdale he said brother
[1:03:18] and he says give me your testimony so I
[1:03:20] gave my testimony and he said wow he
[1:03:22] said I've never heard anything like that
[1:03:24] before so the next year brother Arie
[1:03:26] came up so we're we're we're staying at
[1:03:28] brother Ed's house and brother Ed said
[1:03:30] brother Arie he said would you mind
[1:03:31] giving me your testimony how you met
[1:03:33] brother Ernie so brother Arnie said oh
[1:03:35] brother Ed I don't want to do that you
[1:03:37] know oh you you know it's too embarr no
[1:03:41] brother it's okay brother Arie come on
[1:03:43] go yeah I want I just I just want to
[1:03:45] hear it and so brother Arie he gave the
[1:03:48] same testimony and brother Ed came to me
[1:03:50] he said brother Ernie he said if there
[1:03:52] is anybody in the whole whole world that
[1:03:55] should believe in extreme predestination
[1:03:58] it's
[1:04:00] you and see each one of us we were
[1:04:03] predestinated to go a certain path and
[1:04:06] we can take our imagination and our
[1:04:08] memory and and and we can go back and we
[1:04:11] can relive the
[1:04:14] positive and we can forget the negative
[1:04:18] but then F so so that's the second realm
[1:04:20] but the second realm it's not a holy
[1:04:23] realm it's not a royal realm it's not an
[1:04:25] eternal realm see one day if the Rapture
[1:04:29] doesn't take us one day and you know
[1:04:31] it's sometime it sounds crude but
[1:04:33] brother brandom said it one
[1:04:35] day the maggots and the skin worms are
[1:04:39] going to be crawling through your flesh
[1:04:41] some of them are going to be eating
[1:04:43] heart some of they going to be eating
[1:04:44] lungs some of they going to be eating
[1:04:46] thighs some of them I don't know how
[1:04:48] they taste but some of them are going to
[1:04:50] beaten my toes oh my liver oh just
[1:04:54] thinking about it makes my liver
[1:04:56] quiver you know but but you know someday
[1:05:00] if if if I if if we don't go the way of
[1:05:02] the Rapture that's what's going to
[1:05:03] happen you know they said if you take a
[1:05:05] man and put a man in a box and seal that
[1:05:08] box airtight so nothing can get in and
[1:05:11] nothing can get out and you come back uh
[1:05:14] you know a little while later and those
[1:05:16] those skin worms are going to be
[1:05:18] crawling all through that through that
[1:05:20] body see and so the first realm it's not
[1:05:23] an eternal realm the second realm our
[1:05:26] our our mind it's not an eternal realm
[1:05:29] but we're only as safe as the realm that
[1:05:32] we choose to live in but when we get
[1:05:37] transferred into the Third Realm we get
[1:05:40] transferred into the realm of the holy
[1:05:43] of holy that's the bedroom out here is
[1:05:46] the kitchen out here is the living room
[1:05:48] but in here is the holy of hly and that
[1:05:51] can only bring you in by the Third pole
[1:05:55] it's like the outer court and the inner
[1:05:57] Court then the holy of holies and again
[1:06:01] you're only as safe as the realm or the
[1:06:04] dimension that you choose to live in by
[1:06:09] choice I choose to live in that realm
[1:06:12] where brother brandom said you get in
[1:06:13] that realm he said have you ever met
[1:06:15] somebody who's been in that in that Holy
[1:06:17] of holy is so sweet it's so kind so
[1:06:21] gentle so so caring so humble you know
[1:06:25] they they they've been with God and and
[1:06:27] when you really spend time with God it
[1:06:30] changes you
[1:06:33] see we say I'm a human being no you're a
[1:06:36] human becoming you're a human becoming a
[1:06:39] supernatural being and when you live in
[1:06:42] that realm my all the other things you
[1:06:45] know the the the outer realm the inner
[1:06:48] realm all your five gates here your five
[1:06:51] gates here everything passes away way
[1:06:55] and all that all that counts is that God
[1:06:57] has given you the privilege to live in
[1:07:01] that inner secret chamber where the
[1:07:04] shakina glory is all around you it
[1:07:08] saturates your being it changes you it
[1:07:12] transforms you it takes you on a
[1:07:14] paradigm shift you go from being you
[1:07:17] know some people you know that they're
[1:07:19] naturally negative and pessimistic but
[1:07:21] God changes them and they become
[1:07:23] positive POS and optimistic it's the
[1:07:26] word that does it and remember only the
[1:07:29] word only this message can transfer
[1:07:32] somebody nobody else there's not going
[1:07:34] to be any Baptist in this holy real they
[1:07:37] not going to be any Presbyterians or
[1:07:39] lutherans or Catholics now you know God
[1:07:41] may God may know something about them
[1:07:43] they may give a glass of water to
[1:07:45] somebody in the bride and they may be
[1:07:47] with us in heaven but they're not going
[1:07:50] to be bride there's no possibility for
[1:07:52] them to become bride they have to either
[1:07:55] die or go through the tribulation one or
[1:07:57] the other and if if they're a foolish
[1:07:59] virgin in the tribulation they're going
[1:08:01] to be hunted down like
[1:08:04] dogs and they're going to have to give
[1:08:06] their life for their faith or they'll
[1:08:09] compromise and they'll say well you know
[1:08:11] I I'll just kind of try to work within
[1:08:12] the system you know that that's death
[1:08:15] death God God gives us life he says
[1:08:18] choose life choose Zoe life eternal life
[1:08:24] positive life and choose to share it
[1:08:28] with everybody else live it breathe it
[1:08:32] manifest it share it become who God has
[1:08:37] designed us to be and God has designed
[1:08:40] us all to go through all these
[1:08:43] experiences all these experiences but
[1:08:47] our ultimate destination is here and
[1:08:50] brother brandham said and I believe it
[1:08:52] that you can get so close and so deep in
[1:08:56] here that the devil cannot even find you
[1:09:00] isn't that what we all want we want to
[1:09:02] be in the place where the devil cannot
[1:09:05] even find us God bless you Saint let's
[1:09:08] stand to our feet
[1:09:18] amen how many would say I I I want to be
[1:09:21] given that sacred access into the holy
[1:09:24] of holies I want to live there I want to
[1:09:27] stay there I want to bring as many
[1:09:30] people as possible I want my family
[1:09:33] there with me I I want maybe those who
[1:09:36] I've had the opportunity to work with I
[1:09:38] want them to be with me I want all all
[1:09:41] that I know and all that I love and and
[1:09:44] all that God brings my way I want to
[1:09:46] bring them in this is not something you
[1:09:48] know it's just me and mine and that'll
[1:09:50] be fine or just me and us for and no
[1:09:52] more that's not that's not the kind of
[1:09:54] gospel that we preach if you're a real
[1:09:57] Christian you want you want that
[1:09:59] Christianity to explode you want your
[1:10:02] life people come into your your presence
[1:10:04] and they feel an atmosphere we had the
[1:10:07] principal in our school I mean the the
[1:10:10] the the supervisors who come in and they
[1:10:12] check out the you know the Christian
[1:10:14] schools and believe they get real real
[1:10:17] picky about Christian schools and they
[1:10:21] want to go there they want to make sure
[1:10:22] the library is right they want to make
[1:10:24] sure that the lab is right and the
[1:10:26] computers are right and these children
[1:10:28] are being given access to a first first
[1:10:31] class education because fortunately in
[1:10:33] Canada where our school is the Canadian
[1:10:37] government pays for half of the tuition
[1:10:41] for that student so they come and
[1:10:42] they're inspecting and and and and they
[1:10:45] wrote a letter and uh you know they just
[1:10:48] sent me the letter the other day and
[1:10:50] these inspectors in the letter they said
[1:10:52] you you should be proud of your school
[1:10:56] you should be proud of the teachers you
[1:10:58] have you should be proud of the way your
[1:11:01] children
[1:11:02] conducts and they even said there is an
[1:11:06] atmosphere in your building that we've
[1:11:09] never felt before see it it's God it's
[1:11:13] God living in those children God living
[1:11:15] in those teachers God manifest his
[1:11:18] presence it's so wonderful when you come
[1:11:21] to a church and you know that church has
[1:11:23] been bathed in prayer the service has
[1:11:26] been bathed in prayer the pastor has
[1:11:29] been before God the pastor or the
[1:11:31] minister whoever it is they have been in
[1:11:34] that that that chamber there and they're
[1:11:36] just waiting on God waiting for the
[1:11:39] inspiration waiting for a thought to
[1:11:42] come waiting for a verse to come waiting
[1:11:44] for a part of the message to open up to
[1:11:47] them and then as they sit down and they
[1:11:49] write something else comes along
[1:11:51] something else comes along something
[1:11:52] else comes along alone you know and and
[1:11:55] and and and we've got such a resource of
[1:11:58] the you know many people the only
[1:12:00] resource that they really have is they
[1:12:02] use the Bible or they'll try to go back
[1:12:04] and see something that Spurgeon wrote
[1:12:06] you know try to get one of his sermons
[1:12:08] but we've got access to over
[1:12:11] 1,00 Masterpiece messages and we're able
[1:12:15] to draw from them you know it's like a
[1:12:18] supernatural morgage board right you
[1:12:21] know and God has given it to us and
[1:12:23] everybody has access to it but the
[1:12:26] question is as I close the question is
[1:12:29] do we
[1:12:31] choose do we choose to use our
[1:12:35] eyes our ears our taste our smell our
[1:12:39] touch do we choose to use them for the
[1:12:43] kingdom of God do we choose to use our
[1:12:47] conscience and our memory and our
[1:12:49] imagination and our reasoning and our F
[1:12:51] do we choose to use them to shut out the
[1:12:54] world to shut out all the enticements to
[1:12:57] shut out all the
[1:12:59] allurements and turn and believe me
[1:13:02] sometimes you know sometimes you need to
[1:13:04] fight the devil's going to fight you to
[1:13:07] get you know to get into the kingdom of
[1:13:09] God to get into the presence of God you
[1:13:11] know there's going to be Warfare daily
[1:13:14] Warfare if you're a Believer Satan he's
[1:13:18] he he he's around you or his imps Fallen
[1:13:22] Spirit they're around you you
[1:13:24] 247
[1:13:26] 365 and if you're a Believer when you
[1:13:28] wake up in the morning you got a big old
[1:13:30] Bullseye on your back and every demon in
[1:13:33] the area knows who you are know your
[1:13:36] address your phone number your email
[1:13:38] account your Twitter account and
[1:13:40] whatever else is out there in that in
[1:13:42] that
[1:13:43] realm you know so so so we've got to be
[1:13:46] on guard every day first thing in the
[1:13:49] morning put on the whole armor of God
[1:13:52] take that helmet consciously helmet put
[1:13:55] on the helmet put on the breastplate
[1:13:57] have your loins G about with truth have
[1:14:00] your feet shed with the preparation of
[1:14:02] the gospel of peace and have that sword
[1:14:04] and have that Shield say Lord I'm going
[1:14:07] out for Warfare today I'm going to fight
[1:14:09] with the devil you know you know what I
[1:14:11] know every day I know there's got to be
[1:14:14] two
[1:14:15] deaths I got to die and the devil's
[1:14:18] going to die and it's my privilege to
[1:14:21] drive a spear or a sword right through
[1:14:25] his neck every day and you do it by
[1:14:29] overcoming Power Glory that has been
[1:14:32] implanted in Us by the Holy Ghost the
[1:14:36] Holy Ghost living inside of you
[1:14:39] instructing you nudging you opening a
[1:14:43] door closing a door giving you that
[1:14:46] inspiration your mind becomes a breeding

[1:14:53] mind becomes your mind is a fertile
[1:14:55] bedding ground and whatever thoughts
[1:14:57] that you plant in your mind that's
[1:14:59] what's going to come up I want to plant

[1:15:37] trying to position them into that holy
[1:15:40] of holies into that Third Realm that
[1:15:43] Holy

[1:19:26] they made a drawing one time one did on
[1:19:28] this and we deliberately added the word
[1:19:31] r in the middle of it because it was
[1:19:34] just Faith doubt so that could mean
[1:19:38] either one of them I mean both of them
[1:19:39] be present at the same time but so we
[1:19:43] kind of touched up their drawing and put
[1:19:46] o in the middle you know cuz that's the
[1:19:48] way brother R said it's Faith or doubt
[1:19:51] because they can't be in our together
