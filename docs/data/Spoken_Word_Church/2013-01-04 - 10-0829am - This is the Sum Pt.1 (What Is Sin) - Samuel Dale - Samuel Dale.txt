everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn to Hebrews 8 in Ecclesiastes 12 Hebrews 8 Ecclesiastes 12 now if you like me hard to find Ecclesiastes it's right next to Songs of Solomon and it'd be 704 of you if you got your scoffield Bible good to see brother Howard sister Kathy back there with us GL to have him them here today just pray that the Lord would bless them and everything and uh remember now the Lord willing that this coming Saturday on the 4th of September the Bible study will be here at 6:00 so remember that and remember there'll be a ministers meeting on Saturday if any of the ministers wants to go it will be at brother Bill y on Saturday the 11th we'll be trying to go up and and be in that so and remember now the fellowship meeting then will be the third Saturday of September at brother Homer lorus remember these and pray that the Lord would would be in each one and guide each one amen Hebrews 8 and Ecclesiastes 12 amen Heavenly Father we thank you for an opportunity to be able to gather this morning thank you for your love and your grace unto us We Praise Your Great Name because truly you are worthy amen and father we ask you to do as we sing that you would Open the Eyes of our hearts that we may see you Lord the spiritual understanding that would dwell in each one of us we ask you to bless each one now remember the sick among us you said you sent your word and healed us so we believe that you will do that we ask you now to just have your way and bless each one that we may all Lord receive what you would have for us this day L remember those that are not here and maybe when they hear the tapes you open their understanding also guide each one now and keep us in Jesus name amen and amen now I'm going to read a couple of verses but what I want you to do is go back and read all back before then and you'll see why in a minute because that's why we're we're doing it but go to Hebrews 8 and one and remember the sixth chapter he winds up talking and getting into who is mzd all right then he goes through the seventh chapter of explaining mzc and who he is and all of the things of the priesthood and and and all like that and then now look what he says in verse one of the eth chapter now of the things which we have spoken you know the things that he's covered now the book of Hebrews up till now watch what he said this is the sum all right now what is the sum the understanding of what is fixing to say now we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty in the heavens all right now go back to Ecclesiastes like I said if that's hard to find go to Proverbs it's between Proverbs and the songs of Solomon now then here the Ecclesiastes he covers the entire uh 12 chapters you know and he's coming down to the last two verses and look what he says in the 12th chapter and verse 13 let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter now then what is the conclusion of the whole matter to fear God and and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man you may be seated to the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now I should have used these scriptures um last Sunday afternoon and U this past Wednesday but uh you know we'll just go from here because what we're going to do for a while is take some topics you remember I told you that we wasn't backing up as much as you would think but that we were speaking from a certain position of thought and understanding that when the prophet said that the head and body would unite in the last days to bring the message all right now you say but brother random brought the message that's true that's right but then the 54 Ministry must take that message and break it down to the people all right then the people must take the message and break it down to one another right and then the people must become which is the fivefold ministry and the whole church together we must become what the prophet has said because that way then we would be able to understand so it would have been really good to have given the last couple of messages cuz what we spoke on was true Grace and and uh see but you remember what I said now in the book of Hebrews Paul had bringing down from the situation of all up to that point he makes an outstanding statement he said this is the sum you know sum means like the chief or main point in other words the principal thing that you're talking about or it can mean amount of anything you know it has those meaning but then Ecclesiastes said that this is the conclusion which means the end you know of a matter see so he was closing out Ecclesiastes was closing out what he was having to say and he says now here's the conclusion of the matter here's the end of the matter you know words I I spoke to you all of these things and I want you to know here is the conclusion of the matter to What Fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man uh now so what we're going to do is I don't know how many are what we'll do but we're going to take some topics and things and and that's why I said that I wish I had used it last Sunday there but that's all right we'll still just go on but see when we were talking about true Grace now to bring something to a conclusion it means you summed up all of the things you know and then you're making a statement from that that would show what you're talking about right so Paul in all of his doings of explaining up through Hebrews uh 7 through it the of the one true and the Living God and how that mzd was that God and uh you know and in Jesus we see no more of mzc because he became Jesus Christ because the one true and living God all right so he's summing all that up all right and then Ecclesiastes says we're going to come to the end of it now uh brother Mo many many years ago brought out a word that um from the Greek and I'm sure Greek or Hebrew one but it means morine now not like the shot morphine that you take for sicknesses it means morine in the fact that and if I mispronounce it so you know you corrected whatever uh it means that when you come to the end of the conclusion of something you summed it up and you make a statement then it means nothing else can be added to that statement amen all right so now I I believe that it's time that you and I by the opening of the word in the end time can make statements and bring things to a conclusion and say this is what it is right you know all right and then uh we don't have to worry now there was a time we all was concerned about because we looked at the Bible where it would say uh be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect will get to that you know eventually and and you know we would think well boy we're we're perfect but then somebody would come along and they would preach none good no not one well then we wored in between the two and we were actually what we were doing was making it contrary one to the other you know right all right cuz it would look like an opposite View and we would make it contrary when it was the same Bible saying both things all right so then uh you know if it's the same Bible see like it is in water baptism that we read there in you know Matthew 28:19 it tells us to be baptized what in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost right but 10 days later from the statement D the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost and they asked Peter said you know what ask Apostles and Peter answered said you know men and Brethren what must we do to be saved they said repent every one of them and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ right well well Peter couldn't remember too good you know right 10 days prior to that the Lord Jesus looked like he was saying Father Son and Holy Ghost right but see Father Son and Holy Ghost is not a name right father's not a name son's not a name Holy Ghost is not a name all right now see so then we sum it all up and realize that is like I said there Wednesday night though I think it was that I have heard people say in this message to say we take acts 238 for our baptism the denominations Etc takes uh you know Matthew 28:19 no if they took Matthew 28:19 they would have to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because see you couldn't make one contrary to the other one right oh but Brother D there's contradictions in the Bible I'm with Brother brandom come and show me where they're at right amen come and show me where the contradictions are oh yeah our human mind now right we have a lot of contradictions right but now come and show me where one is contrary to the other one see and that's what I'm trying to tell you or to show you that that there's a lot of things that now we understand that we previously did not have the understanding right and so we could you know it would be a a an argument and you'd say well uh you know like some used to say well uh I'll shoot down your scripture with what with a scripture well now that's like taking what you want and arguing over it right now but that won't that won't never work cuz you'll never get any kind of an answer there you can't come to a conclusion as Ecclesiastes said you can't sum up what you're saying amen you know so then if you got all kind of contradictions then what is the the uh answer if I ask you the reason of the hope that lies within you as the scripture said what would be your answer well I don't really know and that's the way they are a lot of them in the message cuz once you narrow down things especially about Daniel 70 weeks or something like that they'll say well I don't really know right well the prophet preached said why can't we know amen I mean you know now what he didn't preach we don't have to worry abouten cuz that's up to him but now as I said Paul said let's sum this up so that'll be your title it'll probably be for a few weeks you know maybe few Services Way's going to preach this afternoon for us we didn't know he was going to have to work today but he wound up having to work half the day and Terren took over his Sunday school class and he must have really let y'all have it for 10 minutes because I looked at my watch and here it come up I thought my Lord I want to get that tape let's just go get it and play it now I want everybody to he didn't realize he's being taped he's on internet around the world so he made his what do you call it debut or his beginning of teaching Sunday school this morning and we appreciate that all right appreciate everybody and what they do around here and everything you do you know all right now so do you understand what I'm talking about I think that by the prophet's message you know being preached unto us and him bringing the scripture and covering the things I I think that we we can come down to a conclusion we were discussing with a man one time something and he said well that's all right said about having these ministers meetings and things you know he said that's all right but said brother brand a here to straighten it out you know I said well what he says is here you know because that's that's what I believe now folks anything you name to me you name me any topic that brother brandham said and I'll show you a quote you know that will sound like right that is totally contrary right now you know like one true and living God he said he never Tau nothing but that but I show you where he said let's stand and address the third person of the trinity well now was he wrong or was he trying to uh uh appease those that he was around no he's telling the truth he said I believe in a trinity but he said it's not Trinity of persons right it's Trinity of manifestation right so then you know it's not wrong to but anything you name to me I can probably out of memory from my mind can bring you a quote that would be contrary almost to that you now but I believe the message comes together Amen to sum up what God is revealing to you and I I believe this message is the sum of those things of the Bible right you know as Paul was saying in the eighth chapter the sum of all I said for for seven chapters now this is the sum of it you know of what and he said he made a statement from that and he said this is the PSM we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty in the heaven you know we can sum it up by saying we believe in one true and living God now that's what we're going to be doing you know a few Services all right but now in Acts 17 I think it is in 11 the Bible says that the disciples searched the Scriptures Daily all right now what did they have to search the Scrolls they didn't have Matthew Mark Luke and John written down cuz it was only about somewhere around ad50 when they were actually started to wri it but they were searching the Old Testament Scrolls the scriptures right to see if what was being said was right right now then Paul as Peter would say that he says things hard to be understood to they that are not learned wrestle to their own destruction right all right see Paul winds up to be the spokesman for the New Testament all right not that Peter and him was was you know any problem I'll get to that in a minute but it was the fact that Paul had the greater understanding brother said that Paul understood Jehovah the old was Jesus of the new amen and the others didn't necessarily understand at that fullness what did they understand you mean did they understand the Trinity and Paul understood one God no no they understood that Jehovah the old was Jesus of the new but they didn't understand that Jehovah the old Jesus was new like Paul did right right now we get to that in a minute partial and perfect realization okay cuz I'm making a background out of this this message but see they searched in scriptures and then they begin to see in the book of Acts that God had used Paul to you know as the main spokesman the greater Revelation and they credited that and honored it until you'll find them in the the uh Ephesian age you know as really rebuking and saying you're not saying what Paul said they come to the conclusion of the matter that Paul had the word of of the Lord all right now but remember Paul didn't have his own ideas but Paul is so specific in his writings that he says you will be judged by my gospel so now for the day and the hour that Paul was living he had the Bible Understanding to the perfect realization right right and to he to the point that he would even say that if you say anything contrary to what I'm going to say he said let you be a cursed that's right that's right all right let him be a liar let him be a whatever he's pretty strong wouldn't he right he got that Authority from God cuz Paul brought the New Testament in the the we understand now Faith of the fathers the things he brought it to a conclusion right he summed it all up he goes to the back side of the desert he stays out there for so many years he comes back and he sums up all of the things of the Old Testament amen all right now when he came back he didn't say Peter you're wrong right John you're wrong Mark whoever you know he point him out Luke you know he say you're wrong he said you understand but he said God has given me this understanding now if those two understandings was contrary one to the other then which one are you going to follow if in this message you think I have this quote quotes these quot right and somebody else comes along with something else then which one are you going to follow see now I'm going to believe as I laid it down that Peter expressing the fact that Paul had a greater Revelation but Peter was the one that said you know was up on the mountain I was up there and Paul wasn't up on the mountain I was up on the mountain but he said I have a more sure word of Prophecy I was up there and saw it but the new birth right brought Peter a greater understanding now we'll get to that in a minute cuz I got some quotes and I'm I'm holding them because I want to read them for the point I want to want you to do but I'll sure give you the page number paragraph whatever but see they search the scriptures now daily to see what are the things that had been said was right or not well why can't we search the Bible and the prophet's message because now we have an ability to search the scriptures amen we're not back in the Dark Ages and the things like that we're not back where man couldn't understand we're down here with in the end time of the baptism of the Holy Ghost coming to the faith of the fathers and speaking of adoption and The Headstone as I was bringing the other day where the head and body would unite and bring its own message well I made that as simple as I could then what's he going to say when he when The Headstone comes what is The Headstone message for the end time I'm here I'm here but see you can read quotes and you can do you know brother call H me that one on the front that you remember what I done Wednesday night some of you wouldn't hear yeah that and and we gave out some little little tracks with a bunch of letters on it h if you want one of these be glad to give it to you but see you look at it and figure out what's being said all so you look at it you look you say well what is being said there it is g o d i s n o w h e r e now some people called it immediately I walked into my wife I said what does that say she said it says God is here is now here that's exactly right but you can also look at it and divide it up and say that God is nowhere right amen with the same letters right I can say God is nowhere right but with an understanding that says God is here well now that's according to whether you understand or not so let's search the message now cuz that's the only way that that I know anything about that you know about what the Bible says is I I search the message if I want to know about what something says well I just read that I go see what the prophet has to say about it am before I speak on it I ask the prophet what is this that you're talking about what does this scripture mean you and things all right there's a lot of scriptures in the Bible that I've refused to ever speak of because I couldn't find what the prophet said about all right so that's just the way I do it of course everybody don't do it that way but that's all right now the way I want to approach this is to compare scriptures and quotes and things not compare it with to the basis or search it to fi try to find which one is correct you know but I want to look at it that it makes a beautiful picture right and unless it was said the way it was said that you would not be able to understand it when it would come down to the basis of saying it you know and we say well we know this is right and like I said now we can reading the Bible where Jesus said baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost and people will say I'm going to say what Jesus said well just remember amen the man that wrote that wasn't Jesus right the man that wrote that down for us was Matthew now so you saying well now I'll take what this or I'll take what Peter says or I'll take what Paul says or I I want to take it all to bring a beautiful picture right cuz that's what I believe the Bible does I believe his prophet's message brought a beautiful picture or I wouldn't be here today talking about it now I know now so don't misunderstand me I know that even brother randam taught like the white horse rider was the Holy Ghost there was some things he Tau throughout the message that would have not been correct now that doesn't fit now so white horse rider being the the prophet preaching it as the Holy Ghost and then preaching later as the Antichrist that's not partial and perfect realization don't try to bring that together cuz that won't fit together all right but you see he corrected it that's right now what he didn't correct you better leave it alone right right now that's just blunt as I can be all right see Brother Don ruddle used to make a statement years ago and remember it was pretty good he said anybody with oneeyed and high sense or know that's right if it's just plain Common Sense we to know if God sent a prophet then God was to honor that prophet's word but see now you understand what I'm saying but if he corrected it see if he said I used to think it was this way we'll get back to this one of these days and and I'll go ahead now but show you kind of how I'm going and and what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost he will take a topic on that amen you know what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost I just believe the word well now are you going to leave out where it says by their fruits you shall be know no you better not leave that out because your Prophet still used it so you understand what I'm trying to get that yes I don't think that we were sent to correct brother brandham or anyone else because if you can correct brother brandham I've always been that away anybody can correct brother brandham the prophet of God that was brought to us the message he brought if they can correct we ought to be following that person and not brother brandham that's plain s well brother so and so says he he was wrong here well then let brother so and so come here and tell me where he's wrong yeah but just remember he better bring all of his quotes with him I'm not arrogant and hateful I'm just plain blunt you know big old man sitting on one porch one time and he was talking about how that brother randam was Malachi 3 you know and we had Malachi 4 had to come and and uh so after a while I picked up what he's talking about I just looked him in the face and he weighed about 475 lb big old guy and uh I looked him in the face I said well let me tell you something John the Baptist was Miki we can prove that by the scriptures brother R's message would fall into Malachi 4 you know the understanding and opening of the word and I said but now I'm going to tell you to your face if you think you're Malachi 4 which HS what he did see I said If You Think You're Malachi 4 I want to tell you face you're not him cuz I'm a been sarcastic God he and I real friends today may be listening to this tap he has done it I know but I'm not arguing I'm not mad nobody I just tell it the way I see it I'm not the final Authority around here God is all right now to help us to understand to get a better understanding of things I believe brother brandom grew in Grace and knowledge I believe the Bible said Jesus grew in Grace enough all right now see all right now to grow in Grace and knowledge does not mean to correct things right unless it needs to be corrected to grow in Grace and knowledge so you can't say that you used to believe in a trinity now listen to what I'm saying now be I'm specific when I talk so listen you say I used to believe in a trinity but I grow in Grace and knowledge now what do you mean you didn't grow in Grace and knowledge you ought to repented to believe in a trinity you can't take a trinity and grow in Grace and knowled and it come out to be one God come on well of course we say but I've grow in Grace and knowledge now when you grow in Grace and knowledge is when you get an understanding a partial realization of one true and living God not a trinity but a partial realization of one true and living God and then you can grow in Grace and knowledge but you understand that's way people talk and that's all right maybe they mean what I'm saying but I don't I just listen I'm sorry cuz if you say I used to believe in in hell was eternal but now I don't believe in hell is eternal I've grow in Grace and knowledge well now what you're saying is okay but are you saying that the eternal hell was right no you can't do that that's right you can't grow in Grace and knowledge of error come on Amen it just won't fit that's right see I believe things will open into a deeper deeper meaning huh amen you know I believe God does not reveal to you and I I don't believe he revealed it to brother brandom there was a man that said he never believed it but one true and living God right cuz he was a prophet okay but you know what he said one day he said I used to to Think Jesus loved me and the father hated me he said I found out there a selfs same person right you know what he done he grow in Grace and knowledge right then when he come to the seals and he went back and he repr preached a lot of messages that he had preached prior to then but he preached it in a deeper meaning amen right all right now listen to these quotes we're all familiar with where the Prophet would say the Bible became a brand new book amen but are you familiar with this statement remember that was after the opening of the seals when he made that statement that was on God's power to transform 1965 911 how about this statement glorified Jesus 1955 2:25 now the only way that boy could have ever did that and know that that was the right sacrifice it had to be a spiritual Revelation from God that's exactly now this is 1955 it's been ever since spiritual revealed truth how God in his Mercy through the operation of the Holy Spirit reveals spiritual truth the word itself and if you're trying to read it from some educational standpoint listen and you just read it like you was trying to in other words figure out mathematically something but if you read it after you have received Christ into your heart now did you hear what he said you're just reading it intellectually or whatever you want to know like reading a newspaper you know read anything but if you read it after you have received Christ into your heart it's a brand new book again you remember that you remember when you got converted now the Bible became beautiful wonderful the things you had read before seem to just Amplified and magnified you know it just wonderful so you don't have to wait until the seals break for it to be a new book so we start off with a new book as partial realization when you're born again we read it by the holy spirit amen right now watch this one contending for the faith 1956 020 with all of our theology if you ever go to Jerusalem or the Eastern country where this Bible was written it's a brand new book to you been there experienced that right our Western ideas are far from the Eastern ways you'll not can't understand The Parables and so forth the teaching until you go there and see those same Customs lived out today well now brother brandham never went to Jerusalem but he got close enough to understand all about them animals and the things that he saw and right cuz he went to Egypt but you see he said by seeing something or experiencing it you know and understanding it the Bible becomes a new book I've got it written from you know some here have been there and I've got it written in my Bible like we visited here we visited here we visited here we visited here well that's wonderful to me cuz it made it look good you know like in the Bible it talks about a a uh u thig tree well we don't have fiig trees we have fi bushes you know what they have over there thick trees one we saw was probably about you know big as a 5 gallon bucket in diameter and probably 30 40 ft high but a fiig tree see it made it different but you understand what I'm saying see the prophet says when you get born again it becomes a brand new book he said if you can go there and see the things now we got the opportunity to be able to see it by internet systems or video and things that that you you don't have to go there you can you can they give you a good uh sh and as a matter of fact a lot of those are better than actually being there because you're not able to see all the things that they tell you you know because you're in a crowd pushing backwards and forward and trying to get up here's another group over here another group over there and you you know we was down there was it the P of P of beesa and really the the guide with us had to pull us off to another place because this guy he was over there uh explaining around I think it was right pul of Bethesda but anyhow and he was very very uh loud so every time Ruben start to say something they got over the top you know and I'm not making fun of him but he just pulled us off to the S well we didn't really get to see a lot about that so you can go get your video and see it your see your prophet's not saying you can't understand it if you ain't been there it can be revealed if you've never been there or seen a video either right now but you understand see we're not putting it on the basis of just waiting till the seals break we're talking about it as a brand new book by the new birth and by even being there now we get to the one that's on God's power to transform 1965 911 but since the opening of those Seven Seals of them Angels just behind the mountain under this has become a new book it's the things that's been hid is being revealed as God promised it in Revelations 10 that he would do it all right now we can say the Bible's become a brand new book well you know I've heard people read out of the old book now I'll Express that in a minute and say it's a new book right well I have to admit what they read out of it and what they pre preach with some other book beside the Bible so if they're talking about that kind of a new book they got plenty of them cuz you can't read a trinity you can't read those things you can't read the the two Souls the River Jordan the the peruas ETC you can't read them out of the Bible cuz they're not in it no more than it's in the Bible that hell's Eternal no because you have to have eternal life to live there then God would have to give you his own life to send you to hell that won't work see there's a lot to be understood about hell is can be forever forever forever forever forever forever forever eternity is not that eternity is on py but it's you know but do you understand what I'm saying now this is a background to understand some of the things that uh you know I want to bring out but now let me make the point of what I want to bring see I believe that the Bible is written the way God wants to write it you know and I believe the prophet of God preached it as God revealed it to him amen I believe we're supposed to do that and we're not supposed to mess up the Bible but we're supposed to understand the things like I've always said about when I finish the series you on the second coming there and and I've always told you in the Bible like his three comings of Jesus Christ he comes to get his bride he comes to the 144,000 and the tribulation then he comes back with the bride in the Millennium each one is his coming but you take either one of them in the scriptures for this one put it over on this one or this one over on this one see you're not you're not summing up what's being said you're not coming to a conclusion you're coming to a messed up understanding so then we've got to have it to that basis but the way I like to to say it is you know I believe that let me illustrate with the Book of Daniel in the Book of Daniel if you go read it you'll find it that it looks like that it is uh multiple Visions dreams Etc you know and this will be this and this will show this and then this will show this and this will show this but if you read it and really understand the understanding of what Daniel is doing he's showing you in the Book of Daniel uh this and this and this amen and this it is all one thing right it's the unfolding amen of the word of God right he's not shown 10 different things he's show he's being shown one thing but each one is rising higher am and higher and higher illustrate it again like see uh we know that it was promised that the Messiah would come right right right see that was back in Genesis you know I put enemity between thy seed and Seed of the woman the promise of Jesus Christ coming all right but see it was not told how it was going to be but then you get over to Isaiah which is a complete book in itself but you get over in the book of Isaiah and you'll find that Isaiah talks about a verse shall conceive right well what is that more understanding right right it's going from partial realization toward perfect realization right one day th stood a virgin you know be it unto me according to Thy word she had come to perfect realization of what had all had been said of the Messiah now it's perfect realization into her and she conceived see I believe that's the way the entire Bible is written I believe that's the way this message is written amen that's why it is to the basis that the sinner cannot understand it come on I don't care how much you read it and can memorize it word for word there was a man from some University came to Gainesville years ago to talk to brother George brother Mike and brother Tatum and him brother Mo and him about that they were believing in one God and he was trinitarian well now he could quote the entire Bible from memory me entire Bible he could quote but once they got to talking to him and they finally got asking him what was his name and he saw that he was pinned in the wall and he wouldn't even say the name Jesus they'd say brother George his life and he know he'd say you know what's his name Rose Shar little that he wouldn't say Jesus why because he seen his defeated but yet he could memorize it to memorize the Bible of this message is not the point it's for it to be revealed right yes if you understand one thing it's better than all of our intellect right but now I've always said if I don't get the intellect first how am I going to get a revelation right see because people would take that and say I don't need to study cuz I might get an intellect out of well you ain't going to get nothing that's right CU you don't have nothing to start with right I just believe I just believe well why you believe well I really don't know but I just believe believe what the Bible said unless we believe that he is all right but you understand that we're for with a subject of partial to perfect realization how that brother brandham explains it in the church age book 297 of the Philadelphian Church which is a church age book these things sayth he that is true sound like maybe something false you know too no watch you now this word true is a very wonderful word it does not mean true in just the sense that it is is opposite to false right that's what we think true and false true and false true and false it expresses the perfect realization of an idea as contrasted with its partial realization he goes on to explain you know that Moses gave him Mana in the wilderness and Jesus said what I am that bread that came down the Wilderness the Mana was great and wonderful but yet there was a day the man ofas when he went into the old and ate the old corner of the land it became a greater Revelation but see Jesus was that bread that come down from heaven partial realization perfect realization okay still on the same page 292 since the word indeed expresses perfect real ization as against the idea of a partial realization as Illustrated in these verses we can Now understand as never before an to type contrasted with type and substance with Shadow you know you you take a shadow it's not the substance but it's it's the shadow of the substance there is something there that's real or it won't make a Shad take the example now of Mana from heaven God sent down Angels bread from heaven for Israel but that bread does not satisfy it was only good for a day those who ate it were hungry again the next day if it was left around it became contaminated but Jesus is the true bread from Heaven whereof Mana was just a type and if any man eats of that bread that came from Heaven he will never hunger again you remember that's what he said to the the little woman at the well you know about the water so if you drink of this water you'll never thirst oh man give it to me I you mean I'll never have never be thirsty again I wouldn't want he say he's talking about a spiritual Mana spiritual water right but see he was trying to lay down something and so am I so do you understand yes of what I believe whether you believe it or not that I can't convince you and I can't reveal it so I just preach what I believe and uh you know I don't try to preach what somebody else believes because I don't know what somebody else believes right I'm honest because you can tell me you believe so and so and so and so and so and so I said well amen I believe that much but I don't know what you believe but see I believe the Bible as I've laid down the situation gives you a partial realization of something and then it'll turn out to be more re revelation of that more revelation of that cuz it's Revelation added to Revelation and then one day it will come out to perfect realization I believe this is the day that we are to understand the perfect realization amen there was times when I came into this message I had questions that I wanted to ask brother brandham you know about what he was just saying but now we ought to be like you know it's always said quote Beware of the man that's got all the answers that's a good quote but what about the other side of saying beware of them that don't have any answers at all you don't hear that see we make ignorance of what you call it a blessing and once you're pinned against the wall you say I don't understand well that's what Reagan said he had alimer you remember they get on to him about something he said I don't remember well that's easy thing he I don't remember but you you can't do nothing with me cuz I don't remember but if we said it we said it all right got to be but you understand what I'm trying to get to so in this series we're going to be taking some things and we're going to be dealing with them from a partial realization and we're going to try to come out to see a perfect realation of the message of the hour of the Bible and the things that we're we're talking about now let's start off with number one then I said it after these quotes see because if you read everything brother Brown says then you're going to read your question and then the next verse you're going to read your answer so I'm trying to make you know to the point of illustrating all right now brother random or Bible you know what is sin that's the subtitle for it what is sin well immediately your computer works in your brain right now you don't got it you got the answer seems unbelief that's good you we read but what if we come to the point of see that we do sin are we unbelievers what are we he said well we're unbeliever for the time now be careful on that because if you're trying to say you're unbeliever for a time you're saying that the hell was eternal and that's partial realization and now we know hell's not Eternal and that's perfect realization and I done told you that's not what I'm talking about that can't be partial realization of a trinity and this perfect realization to see one God that's totally are opposite to one the other that's not what brother around is explaining he's explaining the things in the Bible that are going to be understood from partial realization to perfect realization so you can't change you only increase in knowledge and Revelation come on you got to get off of the Trinity well brother you know I I believe the Trinity now believe one I just you know like one man said one time he said I shouted over the Trinity he said now I shout over one God I'm sorry I know I'm arogant and hateful but I thought evidently you didn't know much difference in the two cuz if you shouted over one you shouted over the other one you're telling me you're just shouting of what was something you shouted about that's right I'm sorry that's just the way I think you say what is sin do we sin be careful how you're bringing it because if you try to go out you run on the ground and you're going to run a ground to where that you're going to have a trinity out of something and thinking that your Trinity has turned into a one God you repent of a lie you repent of error you don't try to bring era over in well that was the way I believed it I mean I stand right here and tell you that when I was in the Baptist Church I argued like everything with him my brother's a Methodist trinitarian he was a trinitarian to the core fully believing in in three Gods you know and I was in the Baptist I'd argue with him like everything and tell him that ain't right the Bible says there's just one God right cuz that's basic Baptist Doctrine is one God but see when brother Mo said what do you believe I said God one true and living God he said explain it I said God in three persons Blessed Trinity he said you're as much Trinity as they are he said because a person a personality personality of individual individual person it didn't take me a week to figure it out I immediately looked at it and said I don't believe that no more see I repented of that it wasn't I tried to take what I used to believe and bring it over as the people of the message do and bring it over into the message and try to prove the message was saying that two Soul Doctrine ain't nothing in the world but a Mormon doctrine of pre-existence that's what it is you know you go out and try to find these new doctrines the River Jordan doctrine that said Jesus wasn't god Till The River Jordan that's an old doctrine that was back under yes that was an old doctor that nah yes sir cuz that was what they were arguing at 3:25 ad whether Jesus was the substance of God or a light substance that was 325 ad that's not new but see we try to come over and we say no I believe in repenting amen have you ever asked God to forgive you for believing a trinity well I really didn't know I needed to well now you do yes right but instead what you'll do is you'll incorporate that Trinity that you used to believe and then you'll find things of brother brandom that fits with what you used to believe and then you'll say this is what he was trying to say not the best thing do said I'm sorry Lord what I told Brother Mo when he told me that I said I don't believe that no more all right that ended my God in three persons Blessed Trinity well you just didn't have understanding that's all right but I'm still wrong see don't take when I didn't have understanding and try to justify you're wrong all right so you get into them little white lives but what is sin all right brother Brandon what is see invisible Union of the bride of Christ 1965 11:25 page 38 what is sin sin is unbelief unbelief in God now listen sin is unbelief sin is unbelief unbelief in what that's what he said unbelief in what can remember how he explained it Eve never disbelieved God the devil couldn't do that she disb believed his word what is sin sin is unbelief unbelief in what the word unbelief in God which is the word pure unadulterated amen unbelief in God which is the word amen okay now okay brother randam what is sin then we'll get to it in a minute I'll give you I'll give you some scriptures when we get on down try to interrelate the scriptures with u you know so you see this is not what brother brandham believed if brother brandham taught us anything contrary to the Bible he's false prophet right any man any person teaches anything contrary to the word of God me you whoever it is Pope priest king who he's wrong that's where we don't believe that brother random was God no that's we just believe he brought the message of the hour what do you believe well I'm a Pentecostal well who brought the message to the Pentecostals amen you believe in somebody all right so now watch this is offer Inner Man 1953 1212 he said what is sin brother brandham well today I tell you I lost my temper I'm reading what he said here now wait just a minute sin is unbelief now that's what sin is there's no other sin but unbelief it's not a sin to do things like drinking and smoking and gambling and prostitution that's not sin that's the result of sin right that's the reason you do that is because you're an unbeliever H you'll hear him using this scripture John 3:18 he that believeth not is what condemned already he that believeth not is condemned already Hebrews 10 and 26 that was John 3:18 Hebrews 10:26 if we see sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice that's Bible okay so what is sin sin is unbelief in the word of God which is God right yeah the condemnation is because of unbelief now it's not lack of believing God understand that now just just make sure you get that right it's not the lack of believing you know lack of hearing but don't hold you responsible for what you hadn't heard now don't don't go wrong with it see it's only what you hear is what you're responsible for I got a quote at the house laying on the desk when brother R said when you when you see it you know it's true he said you turn it down you're an unbeliever all right but now what is sin sin is unbelief all right now the prophet that answered that question what is sin let's ask that same Prophet the question do we sin brother Brandon do you sin okay let's see if I can find which one was supposed to be on I should have read that other one I'll read it right now on a Ministry explain 19571 what is sin what is sin not drinking not smoking not gambling but not rejecting Church sin is unbelief is that right he that believeth not is condemned already see you're you're you do not you do not you're you're not destroyed or separated from God because you're a sinner you're separated from from to to God from God because you refuse to walk with him to walk in his provided way now you remember what they said to to brother brandham you know the lady when he kept saying and preaching you know that that sin is not dranking gambling smok and run around this lady finally stood up said well brother Brandon what is sin you know he was saying it he said sin's unel believe he said you do them things because you're an unbeliever now you claim to be a believer and go out and do them things while you got you got a problem but brother brandom do we sin okay Hebrews chapter page paragraph 209 of Hebrews chapter 6 1957 908 he's in Hebrews there where it's talking about the princip is a doctrine of Christ let's going to Perfection now we got that this morning how that we are perfect perfected absolutely spotless and blameless now listen not one sin on us are you above Temptation never do you sin every day yes sir do you see him yes sir every day now what are you going to use there okay trying to find I wanted to reread one in here somewhere but I'll get it in a minute contending for the faith 1956 0202 we're tempted all of us are tempted all of us sin there's none without sin every day you sin now listen Paul said he had to Die daily that's First Corinthians 15:31 Paul said we got to Die daily and if we say we we sin we have no sin then the Bible says we make God to lie we sin daily 1 John 1 18-10 read it let's just read that first John 1 8 through 10 you said want to read this other one okay we're going to read the other one but if we're going read this one you don't know what the other one is saying 1 John 1:8 if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us right that's Bible see people say I always was eternal well that make you an eternal sinner because that's what you are right so we got a problem right amen now brother bradam said that we all sin he said every day we sin brother Ram you did you you sin every day he said yes and he said Paul said I got to Die daily because I sin you remember the things I would not I do not the things I do not I would not and all you know all that that's Paul explaining it was Paul an unbeliever was brother Bram an unbeliever see we're not even talking about me and you we just use somebody else right there somebody you look at and say for sure we know this that or the other about them Jesus told the Pharisees John 9948 I think it is he told the Pharisees he said if I hadn't spoken unto you that you had a covering he said now that I spoke your sin remaineth now what about a group of people they and if they have been one Mark against the high priest Etc they would have killed him and yet Jesus was saying he was a sinner they were real good to say we're not sinning like all the others you know but the Bible said they were all right so are we unbelievers what do you say are we Sinners are we unbelievers well Jesus said unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees the guys that Jesus told them they were sinners unless your righteousness exceed the scribes and Pharisees you won't enter Heaven right is that scripture did he say the one that always is argued over you know in Matthew 5:48 be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect that's been argued all down through right now with definitions of words but yet how could we be perfect if we're Sinners are we perfect Sinners I wouldn't want to go that way I think we was I think that's the way we was born perfect Sinners bunch of people trying to straighten out the word of God instead of believing what God Said or try to straighten out this message instead of believing what the prophet said perfect Cy I agree with that but see we like to read all the other things we like to read things that you know we like to read something like this that I just got through Reading part of it paragraph 208 Hebrews chapter 6 57 98 you talking about we got it this morning how that we are perfect per fected absolutely spotless and blameless not one sin onless are you above Temptation never do you sin every day yes sir but yet we are perfected now I'm continue to read because we are in him yes and God could no more judge us than nothing he could couldn't be righteous he's already judged Us in him when he judged Christ he judged me he judged you and he can't judge me again because he took my judgment that's the ones we like right I was reading in this brother Brown used it a lot of times Armenian and and calvinistic you know right because one of them you know believe it's okay do anything in the world you're saved anyway Calvin I think the other one believes you you better make sure if things right cuz if you're right on your knees when you die you go to heaven if you ain't on your knees you got problems oh my it's good Methodist Doctrine but now listen we like to read these serpent seed 1958 9:28 evening service did not David say blessed is the man to whom God will not reckon sin that's Roman something Romans 4 6-8 God will not Recon sin and impute sin to God don't hold a sin against this creature that's strong he said that's not skim milk God will not reckon sin to the righteous okay we like this questions and answerers 1959 628 the evening service will you explain what it means by sinth not in 1 John 518 certainly not who's ever born of God sinth not certainly not I just went through that he can't sin he's born of God sinth not he can't sin but seed remains in him another scripture we might refer to here would be Romans 4 uh 8 which is 4 and 5-8 where God David spoke over there years ago and said blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin because he does not sin token 1964 308 shows that God hasn't recognized your sin now the promises makes free from sin shows that God hasn't hasn't recognized your sin David said blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin and God will never impute sin over that token because it's the token it's the paid sign that God has already received it okay see the descriptions c651 or 118 not even sin is imputed to a genuine unbeliever did you know that he that's born of God does not commit sin he cannot sin see it's not even imputed when David said blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin when you're in Christ you have no desire to sin the worshipper once Purge has no more conscience to sin you don't desire it now to the world you might be a sinner but to God you're not because you're in Christ how can you be in a be in a sinner when you're in the sinless one and God only sees him who you are in on the wings of a dove 1965 11:28 and that's the way with the real Christian did you know a real Christian doesn't have any sin at all imputed to him David said blessed is a man to whom God will not impute sin when you're washed in the blood of the Lamb not by make believe but really the blood of the Lamb God does not impute to you anything that's done because you're under the blood and he doesn't use it there's a blood sacrifice the only thing he can see you in is the way that he saw you before the foundation of the world when he put your name in the loue that's all that he can look at because you are redeemed from everything that was ever done you're washed in the blood of the Lamb therefore there is no G in you g excuse me in you there is no unclean Habit in you because that the blood of the Lamb has did this and God canot not impute sin to you after you've got a sin offering laying there waiting for you we like those quotes don't we questions and answers 58628 do Christians sin absolutely no it must have f up on a battery again we thought we had this thing worked out that's only but we didn't do it but we still got this on Amen absolutely not know there is no scripture where a Christian sins he cannot sin I know there's resentment to that well we'll just go to First John 3 and see what the scripture says about it so what does it say over there it says his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin all right now brother Brandon you said you sin and we all sin you said Paul sin had to Die daily now you're saying that we're perfect and then we can't sin well I'll take this that's what you do I'll take the scriptures and the quotes I'll go on the scriptures and quotes it says I'm perfect well what about the things it says you're not perfect well brother Dale I I'll take where brother brand in the Bible says that I don't sin well what about the ones where the Prophet said you did I take where it said I can't be an unbeliever the prophet says you are an unbeliever the Bible says you are now what are we going to do are we going to take what we want then those things that are true you're facing see brother Brandon was just like Paul I love to read Paul because to me that you'd have to you know that the Baptist where Paul was saying the things I would not I do not and the things I do I would not and all back and forth you know what the Baptist teach they said Paul wouldn't born again till he got that scripture you mean he wrote the Bible but he wasn't born again till he got that scripture so when he finally got to that scripture he got born again now Paul was explaining to Everyday Life of a human being that when we want to do good evil is present I want to do right Satan TR to hinder me brother brand I'm coming along that's what caught me so much with it is the honest and sincerity of a man that would tell you we do wrong every day we sin every day all right so now what we're going to do is we're going to try to justify or explain that there's got to be many many different sins yeah you know so this one is sin but this one is sin and this one is sin no we just all sin all the way CU you can't explain it with the one the children of Israel glory in the fact that they kept the word of God what are you glory in the high priest gloried in that he kept the word of God turned around and killed the word of God because he knew Jesus was talking different than him amen now let me say it to you that high priest those priests knew that they made mistakes now come on just be human I mean don't you don't think that everybody back in the Old Testament thought everything was okey doie well they knew they were people problem but they had already analyzed the thing and come up with a sensible answer that there must be things that is not much counted sin and we don't put it in the category of sin we put it in a category of life that's all right cuz that's where we're at was brother Ram an unbeliever was Paul an unbeliever was Jesus an unbeliever when he planted ropes and run them out of the temple and brother randam said had a temper you say brother Dale you I I walk where I walk Come On Jesus got anger and run him out of the temple was that an anger of Godly anger now he got upset he was angry at the fact of what they were doing so now you're saying that Jesus done wrong I didn't say that cuz I don't say you do wrong I say we're human beings and we live in a life and it's impossible to live in this life without human problems but we got to come to a conclusion of the matter have about 10 minutes till 12 what is the conclusion of the matter then Paul what is the conclusion of the matter brother Brandon what is the conclusion of the matter that we must draw a conclusion you know the Bible speaks that there is a sin under death I don't have time to cover all this I'll just quote the Bible says there's a sin unto death that you don't pray for right it says there a sin in other words if somebody's committed over to the Lord for the destruction of the flesh you can't pray for them that's right well you mean to tell me I can't pray for him well contrary the Bible if you do that's cuz you're not letting God use his wrath that's right well brother d That's my people that's my I don't care if it's my if it's my kids or my wife or or me or who it is it's having to do you got to do what God says do amen right you commit your children into the hand of God as quick as he starts beating on oh I didn't mean it that way I didn't mean you to do it that bad brother around said let them lay on the flat of their back amen and look up they quote a lot that's right we're not supposed to pray for no you're not supposed to pray for somebody that this church says we've turned them over for the destruction of the flesh if you pray for that person anymore after then you are wrong in the Bible that's right but that's not forever sin because the Bible doesn't say that that's the sin that is under death right there is other sin that people do that you pray for right that's the same word sin but one of them is unto death and if they don't straighten up they die and you know where they go of course if they're a Christian they straighten up but then if it's a point in air that they don't straighten up and they are a Christian which would be a very rare occasion then it could be the destruction of the flesh but you see we want to use everyone little Avenue we want for our own benefit instead of looking at something straight up front like brother random did Brother random do you sin he said every day brother random you're perfect he said yes siry brother random do you disbelieve God's word he said show me where I do now you want them quotes do you need him that brother RAM and not only the Lord Jesus Lord Jesus said show me where that I've ever disbelieved you ain't never been reading enough of brother brandom to understand he was saying the same thing to those Pentecostal when he said come show me where I'm off the word show me where I disbelieved you know that we can stand in that same place and say that same thing show me where I'm off the world show me where I sin the category of sin is unbelief show me where it's at but brother Dale you admited you yep mhm I admit I'm a sinner saved by grace so there is some things about Sin that it will not destroy you that does not signify that you disbelieve God God's word but it signifies you're going to get a weapon to get lined up right amen now I'll review this after um this Wednesday cuz I want you to understand brother R said we sin every day that's but then he says we don't sin the script scri says we sin every day and if we say we don't have sin we're liow and the scripture says we're perfect right same man the little John guy over there you know writing he's same one that wrote that you know that was perfect did he see remain of in so what is it that makes us to wor that we're not sinners sinners of unbelief in God's word what is it that makes us to that there's only one thing and that's the new birth because that puts the teacher inside of you Hallelujah and that teacher inside of you can't be contrary to God's word right that's right but are you going to live a life of perfection not in yourself no we're going to do wrong but then we turn around and say well I can't help it now the prophet says you prove you're a sinner cuz if you say you can't help it you what you're doing you're denying God's word that's right because he said I made a way yes like I've always told you he didn't have problems with the children of Israel 10 times they sinned before they got to Cades Baria he was still taking them to the promised land in the great sins that they were doing but when they got to cadis Baria and disbelieved him as the ability to take them over he said to the Wilderness you go and will die there why because they had become Sinners that's right their sins they had committed down through there was not recorded too much could be gotten over as human beings you know but when you disbelieve God's word brother R said when you say that that's God when brother random is is is uh praying for the sick that that's God and then when you say that you don't believe him when he's the doctorine he preaches he said that is sin and we'll have to be reckoned of it do we get by with sin because we're a Christian no we got cover that right why because there's a judgment of the Deeds Done in the body whether good and bad if we don't repent of them in this world we're going to have to give an account that's Bible well what do you mean giving account I'm perfect according to who's looking at what let's stand come on Brothers do you understand I just wanted one thing to try to make a foundation then we'll use that Foundation now for each service of the basis of partial to perfect realization you know things like that we'll be using that on each one as to understand to be able to take things that are said and be able to put them together and to come out of it not with a misconstrued idea see somebody's going to have to say they're perfect you know you going to have to say you're raptured before you can be raptured you know that you know you going to have to say you're healed before you're healed you know that you got to be you got to confess confess that you're saved before you can be saved you know that well I don't want to lie about it no no to worry about you're already a liar don't be concerned about you know what I'm looking at a bunch of liars you know what you're looking at one of the chiefest of all because we're human none good no not one go ahead brother anybody have a need we just sing a verse something a song you have a need come and let's pray it's 1 minute till 12 I'm sorry for being a
