[0:00] turn over to Matthew chapter
[0:06] 4 and a while back um we were on the the
[0:11] genealogy in Matthew and comparing that
[0:13] with the genealogy in Genesis and
[0:16] talking about the son of David and how
[0:18] Matthew presents him as the king and
[0:19] sets up a new kingdom and that's what I
[0:23] kind of wanted to talk about this this
[0:24] morning a real just simple lesson that
[0:26] kind of goes through the
[0:28] Beatitudes and um
[0:31] The Sermon on the
[0:32] Mount so let's talk uh started in
[0:35] Matthew chapter 4 about verse
[0:40] 12 and remember Matthew is the 40th book
[0:44] in the Bible which sets the the um the
[0:47] theme is is like
[0:50] probation what will you do with this
[0:52] Jesus called Christ and um Matthew is
[0:57] the most maybe the most Jewish book of
[1:00] of the New Testament because it's it's
[1:02] presenting Christ to the Jews in fact um
[1:06] Jesus said in um Matthew 15:24 I'm not
[1:10] sent but to the lost sheep of the House
[1:12] of Israel when the sister came up and
[1:14] asked him for healing for her her child
[1:16] and he called her a dog she said I'm not
[1:19] sent but to the lost sheep of the House
[1:20] of Israel she said but even the dogs eat
[1:24] the crumbs from the master's table and
[1:27] um so this whole think about the theme
[1:29] of Matthew is he's presenting the New
[1:33] Kingdom that he's going to set up not a
[1:35] kingdom that's different than what
[1:36] everyone was
[1:39] expecting and um and the Jews were given
[1:43] a period of what what are you going to
[1:46] do with this new kingdom that this new
[1:48] uh what what's being presented to you
[1:50] and they as we all know they turned it
[1:52] down and
[1:53] Cru um so let's kind of start reading
[1:56] through starting at verse 12 just to
[1:59] kind of set it up as we go into The
[2:00] Sermon on the
[2:02] Mount now when Jesus had heard that John
[2:05] was cast into prison he departed into
[2:07] Galilee and leaving Nazareth he came and
[2:10] dwelt in capernium which is upon the Sea
[2:12] Coast in the borders of zabulon and Neal
[2:17] that it might be fulfilled which was
[2:18] spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying the
[2:20] land of zabulon and the land of Nealon
[2:23] by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan
[2:25] Galilee of the Gentiles the people which
[2:28] sat in darkness saw great light to them
[2:31] which sat in the region and shadow of
[2:33] death light is sprung up from that time
[2:36] Jesus began to preach and to say repent
[2:40] for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand so
[2:43] let's take a little second and U this
[2:46] might be very basic but
[2:49] um I think it sometimes it's good to
[2:51] just kind of review the basics about
[2:54] what is the kingdom of
[2:56] heaven and so let's turn over to Luke 17
[3:08] you know J Jesus is let's turn to uh
[3:11] Luke
[3:12] 17:20 his his teachings were very
[3:14] paradoxical when you get into the sermon
[3:16] of the mount it how can you be blessed
[3:19] and be poor how can you be blessed and
[3:21] be um uh you all the different things
[3:24] that he through the
[3:27] Beatitudes how can you be blessed and
[3:29] mourn can you be blessed and reviled it
[3:31] seems like something that uh doesn't
[3:33] quite make sense because his ways are
[3:35] not our ways and
[3:38] um so when you when you think about the
[3:41] Kingdom of Heaven we've got to be part
[3:42] of a kingdom that before we can go into
[3:44] the Kingdom of Heaven the kingdom must
[3:46] be in us first it seems backwards it
[3:49] seems a little bit um than the way we
[3:51] would normally think so Luke
[3:58] 1720 and when he was demanded of the
[4:01] Pharisees when the kingdom of God should
[4:03] come he answered them and said the
[4:05] kingdom of God cometh not with
[4:07] observation because this is what all of
[4:10] the all of the that area of the of the
[4:14] world was looking for was something
[4:16] somebody to ride in with a sword and
[4:18] take over from the Romans they were
[4:21] being impressed by the Romans they were
[4:23] looking for somebody to just change
[4:24] things change set up something natural
[4:28] but it wasn't something natural
[4:30] neither shall they say Lo here or low
[4:33] there for behold the kingdom of God is
[4:35] within you and John chapter
[4:38] 3 let's turn over there real
[4:54] quick chapter
[4:57] 3:3 when he spoke to Nicodemus
[5:00] and this is Nicodemus just couldn't
[5:03] quite understand because it was such a
[5:05] paradox and verse one there was a man of
[5:08] the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of
[5:10] the Jews the same came to Jesus by night
[5:13] and said unto him Rabbi we know that
[5:15] thou are a teacher come from God for no
[5:17] man can do these Miracles that thou
[5:20] doest except God be with him and
[5:22] remember when Peter presented the keys
[5:26] to the kingdom in Acts chapter 2 he said
[5:29] this Jesus who was approved of you and
[5:31] brother bam said the way he was approved
[5:33] was because that before them all he did
[5:36] Miracles he he healed him before them
[5:39] all remember the first pull was healing
[5:42] um a pull drawing you into a Clos
[5:45] relationship with God that uh everyone
[5:48] could
[5:49] observe and uh so he was approved before
[5:52] them all no man can do these Miracles
[5:54] that thou doest except God be with it
[5:56] Jesus answered and said unto him verily
[5:58] verily I I say unto thee except a man be
[6:01] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[6:04] God and we know see doesn't mean see
[6:06] like big buildings or something of a
[6:08] kingdom but to understand that's really
[6:11] the true evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[6:12] to be able to understand the word you
[6:15] can know all these scriptures when it
[6:16] when it really begins to come alive to
[6:19] you then that's his
[6:22] evidence that he's he's been born in you
[6:25] and opened his word to
[6:28] you Nicodemus he goes on Nicodemus just
[6:31] couldn't understand nus said unto him
[6:34] how can a man be born when he is old can
[6:36] he enter the second time into his
[6:37] mother's womb and be born Jesus answered
[6:40] verily verily I say unto thee except a
[6:42] man be born of water and of the spirit
[6:44] he cannot enter into the kingdom of
[6:49] God so let's go back to Matthew
[6:52] 4 and keep
[6:54] reading and Jesus Verse
[6:58] 18
[7:02] and Jesus walking by the Sea of Galilee
[7:04] saw two Brethren Simon called Peter and
[7:08] Andrew his brother casting a net into
[7:11] the sea for they were
[7:12] Fishers and he saith unto them follow me
[7:15] and I will make you fishes of
[7:17] men and they straightway left their Nets
[7:20] and followed him and going on from then
[7:22] he saw two other he saw other two
[7:24] Brethren James the son of Zebedee and
[7:27] John his brother a ship with Zeb
[7:30] their father mending their Nets and he
[7:32] called them and they immediately left
[7:34] the ship and their father and followed
[7:36] him we know brother brand talked about
[7:39] how that this wasn't just all of a
[7:42] sudden they just heard this call all at
[7:43] once but all their life their father
[7:45] Zebedee had been teaching them about the
[7:48] coming Messiah about who to look for so
[7:51] they weren't uh they had been taught all
[7:53] their life this wasn't just a drive by
[7:57] witness and they immediately left the
[7:59] ship shiping their father and followed
[8:00] him cuz this is the one that they had
[8:02] been looking for all their life and
[8:04] Jesus went about all Galilee teaching in
[8:07] their synagogues and preaching the
[8:09] gospel of the kingdom and healing all
[8:11] manner of sickness and all manner of
[8:14] disease among the
[8:16] people and his Fame went throughout all
[8:18] Syria and they brought unto him all sick
[8:21] people that were taken with divver
[8:23] diseases and torments and those which
[8:25] were possessed with devils and those
[8:28] which were lunatic
[8:29] and those that had the py and he healed
[8:32] him his first pull was healing and now
[8:36] I've been kind of reading through FF
[8:38] Bosworth's book on Healing The Sick and
[8:41] U not to get too much off the topic but
[8:44] you know brother R said nobody could
[8:45] explain healing like brother Bosworth
[8:48] and he kind of laid out how if you if
[8:51] you look through through all the New
[8:54] Testament and um let me back like up a
[8:57] second you know we've all got script
[8:59] verses that really mean so much to us U
[9:03] and maybe uh different we each have
[9:07] maybe a different verse like brother
[9:08] Wade always says Genesis 126 and 27 is a
[9:11] verse scripture that really stands out
[9:13] to him for me um you know Colossians 1:
[9:17] 12627 stands out to me
[9:19] but one of the most critical scriptures
[9:22] to understand in all of scripture is
[9:24] Hebrews 138 because if you can find
[9:26] something where uh God did it one way
[9:30] you can follow that all the way through
[9:31] scripture know that he'll do it the same
[9:34] way if you can stand if you can approach
[9:35] him the same way and that's how healing
[9:38] is if you can see if you can approach
[9:40] him the way that they approached him
[9:42] when he walked on the Sea of Galilee
[9:45] then you know he's the same today that
[9:48] he was back then and you can it's like a
[9:50] rock that you can rest on and if you
[9:53] examine the scripture and see there's
[9:56] not one time when anyone approached him
[9:58] for healing that he turned them away and
[10:01] you can say what about the little
[10:02] Samaritan woman that he called a dog she
[10:05] persevered and it didn't take long but
[10:08] she got what she came
[10:10] for there's not one time in scripture
[10:13] where anybody came for healing that
[10:15] didn't get it and you know we've got
[10:18] many sick and Afflicted and I just this
[10:21] this has always helped
[10:23] me when
[10:26] I
[10:28] uh when I was
[10:31] um years ago I right right before Estel
[10:34] was born um I I got laid off from my job
[10:37] and I didn't have a job I was in the
[10:39] hospital when she was being born and I
[10:40] just Hebrews 138 came to mind that he's
[10:43] still the same that he was back there on
[10:46] when he walked the shores and I rested
[10:50] on that knowing that he will provide for
[10:52] us the same way today that he did back
[10:54] then
[10:58] right excuse
[11:05] me and this continuing on there followed
[11:08] him great
[11:13] multitudes I was afraid I was going to
[11:15] get
[11:16] emotional they followed in great
[11:18] multitudes of people from Galilee and
[11:21] from decapus and from Jerusalem and from
[11:23] from Judea and from Beyond
[11:25] Jordan and coming to church this morning
[11:28] we were list to the attraction on the
[11:33] mount and this is getting on moving into
[11:36] chapter 5 where brother Brandon where
[11:39] where Jesus went up the mountain and he
[11:42] was all the multitude followed him
[11:44] because they had seen the signs and
[11:47] wonders that he did in their midst and
[11:51] whenever God's word is being fulfilled
[11:53] it always attracts people because people
[11:57] are looking for to see God word being
[11:59] made
[12:06] manifest so he went up the mountain and
[12:09] all of the multitudes from the East and
[12:12] from the West were gathered to hear and
[12:14] Break Forth the
[12:15] word chapter 5 verse one and seeing the
[12:19] multitudes he went up into a mountain
[12:21] and when he was set his disciples came
[12:23] unto
[12:25] him now this going up into the mountain
[12:29] is is ties together with the Old
[12:31] Testament cuz remember in the Old
[12:32] Testament God came down on the mountain
[12:35] when Moses went up and he delivered the
[12:36] Commandments to to
[12:40] Moses he delivered the Old Testament law
[12:43] so now God Jesus has going up the
[12:46] mountain to deliver the the law for a
[12:49] new kingdom that he's setting
[12:54] up and you think well the Old Testament
[12:57] law that was delivered from Moses is now
[12:59] being done away with you look back
[13:01] through the all the Ten Commandments and
[13:03] you
[13:04] think well examine them and see if any
[13:08] of the Ten Commandments were done away
[13:09] with not not a single one you think well
[13:11] okay now we don't have to keep any
[13:13] particular day look that's that's one of
[13:16] the most misinterpreted Commandments the
[13:18] Sabbath now we rest every day because
[13:21] we're in an eternal Rest In
[13:23] Christ and so God on the on the mountain
[13:27] he set up he came this this Sermon on
[13:30] the Mount is to set up um it's the first
[13:33] really recorded long uh it's the longest
[13:37] message recorded in the in the New
[13:39] Testament that he delivered and it's the
[13:42] um the one he kind of sets in order the
[13:46] kind the character of the people that
[13:47] are going to be in in the New Kingdom
[13:49] and how we're going to be in how we're
[13:51] going to be part of that new kingdom and
[13:54] what it's all about and then he opened
[13:56] his mouth verse two and and taught them
[13:59] say now that's a that's a very powerful
[14:02] scripture he opened his mouth because we
[14:05] know that the spoken
[14:07] word is the Original Seed oh
[14:12] yeah and that's you know brother brand
[14:15] talked about why there's not a lot of
[14:17] new births or why why we people aren't
[14:20] born again is because they're not taught
[14:22] wrong if you take anything out of the of
[14:25] the word or add anything to it then you
[14:28] don't have a Foundation that the spirit
[14:30] can water that the spirit can bring to
[14:33] life and he opened his mouth and taught
[14:36] them so think about this the same one
[14:39] that spoke back before the worlds were
[14:41] created and created the world put the
[14:43] moon and the stars and everything in the
[14:45] place separated the light from the
[14:47] darkness is the same one that was
[14:49] sitting there opening to them the way to
[14:52] enter into the New Kingdom into this
[14:55] Kingdom that all down through the Old
[14:57] Testament they had been looking for
[14:59] and here he was standing before him all
[15:04] down through the Old Testament he had
[15:05] been hidden in uh in Moses and
[15:10] Elijah and finally he's revealed before
[15:14] him the revelation of his
[15:21] word and the spoken word is the Original
[15:24] Seed 1962 brother R said now remember
[15:26] every spoken word of God
[15:29] is the Original Seed God planted
[15:31] everything in the Earth by his word and
[15:34] as long as you stay with the Original
[15:36] Seed it will breede itself right back
[15:39] and reproduce itself again I breed it it
[15:44] dies now that's a real short quote but
[15:46] that is so powerful because that that is
[15:50] um that's like the foundation of
[15:53] everything that we believe you stay with
[15:55] the with the original word and that will
[15:57] see you through if you get away from it
[16:00] at all it can never go back to the
[16:02] original which is what the the whole
[16:04] Plan of Redemption is trying to get us
[16:06] back to fellowship with God to be part
[16:08] of him and if you get away from it one
[16:12] bit that's why it it um we're going to
[16:16] get into blessed are the those that
[16:18] mourn and it it Grieves me to see to
[16:21] talk to people that it it seems like
[16:24] it's not
[16:26] um it's staying with the word is not as
[16:29] valuable to many people as it seems like
[16:32] it used to be and you know looking
[16:34] around there's been we've all heard the
[16:37] reports of many people that um or now
[16:40] they're saying well brother brandom
[16:41] didn't know didn't know what he was
[16:43] talking about that he couldn't get it in
[16:45] the straight in line and I was listening
[16:47] we were listening to that sermon this
[16:49] morning the attraction on the mount
[16:50] where he said that critics that the
[16:52] things that people say
[16:54] are we don't have no argument with them
[16:57] we have one goal goal in life and that
[16:59] is to soak in the word and get closer to
[17:02] him that that don't let it bother you
[17:05] the things that other people do but
[17:06] we're on a path to something greater and
[17:10] our main goal in life it should be to
[17:12] soak it in and get closer to God soak up
[17:15] his
[17:17] word because if we take in the spoken
[17:21] word The Original Seed it will take us
[17:23] back to the
[17:27] original
[17:31] see where
[17:35] am and he opened his mouth and taught
[17:38] them say blessed are the poor in spirit
[17:41] for theirs is the kingdom of
[17:44] heaven now the all these Beatitudes are
[17:46] really simple it seems like we've all
[17:49] we've all grown up with these Beatitudes
[17:51] in the back of our Bible you know
[17:52] there's a place for the Ten Commandments
[17:54] a place for the
[17:56] Beatitudes but you know when God comes
[17:59] and opens his word to you then it just
[18:01] takes on a whole different meaning you
[18:02] see you can see Christ and you can see
[18:06] yourself and you know Christ has
[18:08] revealed in Simplicity and a lot of
[18:10] times we think it has to be um is so
[18:14] complicated but really when you get down
[18:15] to it the message of Salvation is just
[18:18] really
[18:20] simple because the people that God
[18:23] called are really simple people the
[18:25] people that will accept it not intellect
[18:28] schs or um people with u big degrees and
[18:32] whatnot but just really
[18:35] simple people that can receive it to be
[18:39] poor in
[18:40] spirit is to
[18:42] realize that I have nothing that I am
[18:45] nothing and can do nothing and have need
[18:47] of all
[18:48] things now that's not quote from Brother
[18:50] Brown that's something that Minister aw
[18:53] pink wrote that I thought was really
[18:56] good and that you know part the one of
[18:58] the hardest things for new Christians to
[19:00] realize is that when you become first
[19:03] become a Christian you think well I'm
[19:06] going to be I'm I'm going to be good
[19:08] enough to be saved I'm going to be good
[19:10] enough to be worthy
[19:12] enough but that's not how it works when
[19:15] God gives you a revelation that there's
[19:17] no way for you in any way to be good
[19:19] enough then you you are poor in spirit
[19:23] you you got that Revelation that the
[19:25] only one that can take you into the
[19:27] kingdom of God
[19:30] and move you up the stature of the
[19:31] perfect man is God himself so the poor
[19:35] in spirit are those that realize that in
[19:37] themselves they can't do it the poor in
[19:40] spirit are those that are hungering and
[19:41] thirsting for the
[19:43] word god brother talked about in the
[19:46] message
[19:47] thirst that there's a there's two kinds
[19:50] of thirst there's a natural thirst and
[19:52] there's a spiritual thirst and you you
[19:54] got that control tower that kind of
[19:56] tells you you need something something
[19:58] and this spiritual
[20:00] thirst draws you to what you need which
[20:03] is
[20:04] God poor in spirit he talked about
[20:07] Lazarus how he was poor in spirit he
[20:10] didn't have anything of the
[20:13] world but he made an investment now
[20:16] there's another Paradox for you how can
[20:17] somebody who has nothing make an
[20:20] investment if you don't have anything
[20:22] like you got to have money before you
[20:24] can make an investment put it in the
[20:25] bank but he had nothing but he was able
[20:28] to make an investment in Christ because
[20:31] he put everything that he had everything
[20:34] into an investment in the things that
[20:36] were not of this world but the things
[20:37] that are Beyond of the the world Beyond
[20:40] and the rich man the rich uh man he put
[20:43] all his investment in the things of this
[20:45] world right when he went uh when he went
[20:48] to see the uh Lazarus in the B bosom of
[20:52] Abraham he saw what Lazarus investment
[20:55] had had got him because Lazarus in
[20:59] himself he couldn't do anything all he
[21:01] had to do was all he could do was just
[21:03] lay outside the rich man's house and beg
[21:07] but God gave him something that in
[21:09] himself he could never have have have
[21:12] achieved the opposite of what Pharaoh
[21:16] said in Exodus 5:2 who is the Lord that
[21:19] I should obey his
[21:21] voice and that's really a problem with
[21:26] why it's so hard you know he said this
[21:28] easier for a rich man uh for a rich man
[21:31] for a camel to go through the eye of a
[21:32] needle than for a rich man to go into
[21:34] the into the Kingdom of Heaven because a
[21:36] rich man puts all of his uh not that
[21:39] it's bad to have money but a rich man is
[21:41] more has more of a tendency to put all
[21:43] of his
[21:46] um he invests in the things of this
[21:48] world instead of um things
[21:52] Beyond and John Wesley said those that
[21:55] know they can't do it by theirself and
[21:58] you're broken up ready to be molded into
[22:00] the character of Jesus
[22:02] Christ and that kind of goes into
[22:05] pouring a contrite heart and a contrite
[22:08] heart is one that's broken so let's look
[22:10] it and we'll just finish up in just a
[22:13] second look look at Psalm
[22:26] 51
[22:35] verse
[22:45] 16 now all the Old Testament everybody
[22:47] in the Old Testament probably thought
[22:49] what God was really after is for me to
[22:52] just bring an animal what God was really
[22:56] after is in verse 16 for thou desirest
[22:59] not
[23:00] sacrifice else I would give would I give
[23:02] it thou Delight us not in burnt offering
[23:06] the sacrifices of God are a broken
[23:08] Spirit a broken and a contrite heart of
[23:11] God thou will not
[23:14] despise that's another Paradox because
[23:17] that's what God demanded for those
[23:19] sacrifices exactly and I've got quote in
[23:22] here somewhere about how
[23:26] um even even even today you know people
[23:29] come to church without a broken a
[23:30] contrite heart and just sit there and
[23:32] expect just like they did in the Old
[23:34] Testament come dragging up their
[23:36] sacrifice thinking well I've sinned and
[23:38] I'm just going to offer my sacrifice and
[23:40] that's going to be the end of it but God
[23:43] was looking for somebody that was
[23:45] repentant that was truly sorrowful for
[23:47] that mourned for the sin that they had
[23:49] done in their was in their lives that
[23:51] wanted to that could look past their
[23:54] sacrifice toward the holy of holies and
[23:56] think oh God if I could just get in in
[23:58] there where God is and that's what he's
[24:01] really after somebody that wants
[24:02] fellowship with God not just to go
[24:04] through the motions of going to church
[24:07] and bring in your sacrifice and lay it
[24:08] on the altar just because somebody tells
[24:10] you that's what you have to do but
[24:12] somebody that craves after
[24:18] Fellowship see where I
[24:21] am let's look at I well I'll just read
[24:24] this one Isaiah 66 veres 1-2
[24:28] thus sayth the Lord the heaven is my
[24:30] throne and the Earth is my foot stol
[24:32] where is the house that you build unto
[24:33] me and where is the place of my rest for
[24:36] all those things hath mine hand made and
[24:38] all those things have been sayith the
[24:40] Lord but to this man will I look even to
[24:43] him that is poor and of a contrite
[24:46] spirit and trembleth at my
[24:51] word so
[24:53] that I think the theme of that is that's
[24:56] wonderful that you build a house where
[24:58] all men of the Earth can come and
[25:00] fellowship and and uh Fellowship around
[25:03] the word but what I'm really after is
[25:06] somebody that's broken in their heart
[25:07] that's yearning for a closer walk with
[25:10] me with with God and the message
[25:13] Investments um this is the quote about
[25:15] Lazareth I'll just read it real quick
[25:17] and then we'll finish and Lazarus suppor
[25:19] and spirit lay there with not even
[25:21] enough medicine to take care of himself
[25:22] and the dogs licked his sore but one
[25:25] night he they both died and when they
[25:26] died the Bible say said that the poor in
[25:28] spirit was carried by Angel Paul Bears
[25:31] to the bosoms of Abraham the one had
[25:34] invest made him his investment in
[25:37] eternal life he didn't live for what he
[25:40] had here for his popularity he had none
[25:42] he was a beggar at the gate he had
[25:44] nothing he had no money he had nothing
[25:47] he had no friends but yet he was a
[25:50] Believer he had made his investment and
[25:53] he died on the street with the dog
[25:55] licking his sores and the body
