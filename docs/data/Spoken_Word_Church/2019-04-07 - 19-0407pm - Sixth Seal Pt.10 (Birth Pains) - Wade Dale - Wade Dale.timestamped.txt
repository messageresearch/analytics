[19:07] revelation 6 verse 12 that I'll be held
[19:10] we had opened the sixth seal and lo
[19:11] there was a great earthquake Sun became
[19:13] black as sackcloth of hair and the moon
[19:15] became as blood and the stars of heaven
[19:18] fell unto the earth even as a fig tree
[19:19] casteth her untimely figs when she is
[19:22] shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven
[19:24] departed as a scroll when it was rolled
[19:26] together as a scroll when it is rolled
[19:28] together and every mountain and Island
[19:31] were moved out of their places and the
[19:33] kings of the earth and the great men of
[19:34] the rich men and the chief captains in
[19:36] the mighty men and every bondman and
[19:37] every free man hid themselves in the
[19:39] dens and in the rocks of the mountains
[19:41] had just got everybody nobody was left
[19:44] out o world instead to the mountains and
[19:47] rocks fall on us and hide us from the
[19:49] face of him that sitteth on the throne
[19:50] and from the wrath of the lamb for the
[19:52] great day of his wrath has come and who
[19:54] shall be able to stand let's read Romans
[19:57] 8 verse 19 while we're standing where we
[20:01] were talking about a little bit more
[20:03] today than we did last Wednesday for the
[20:06] earnest expectation of the creature
[20:08] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[20:10] sons of God for the creature was made
[20:13] subject to vanity not willingly but by
[20:15] reason of him who has subjected the same
[20:17] in Hope because the creature itself also
[20:19] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[20:22] corruption into the glorious liberty of
[20:24] the children of God for we know that the
[20:26] whole creation groaneth and travaileth
[20:28] in pain together until now and not only
[20:31] they but ourselves also which have the
[20:33] firstfruits of the Spirit even we
[20:34] ourselves groan within ourselves waiting
[20:37] for the adoption to wit the redemption
[20:40] of our body you may be seated in or that
[20:42] is blessing reading the
[20:43] god bless you this afternoon now what
[20:47] we've been talking about we kind of got
[20:49] a little bit on birth pains and this
[20:51] would be birth pains part two or number
[20:55] two and we know that this seal that
[20:58] we're talking about the sixth seal is
[21:00] the judgment seal of the Bible it is the
[21:03] Tribulation Period
[21:05] it is the wrath of God poured out
[21:08] it is it is persecution for the foolish
[21:13] version and for the 144,000 and the two
[21:16] witnesses they will be persecuted they
[21:19] and the foolish virgin the prophet of
[21:21] God said they would be hunted down like
[21:22] dogs and they would have to give their
[21:24] life for the gospel
[21:25] all right so but now the bride will not
[21:28] be there that's not that we are a
[21:30] special group of people
[21:32] he made us that way I was telling them
[21:36] downstairs and if I Burton is forgive me
[21:38] because they see some barbecue okay so
[21:40] we and we just ate it just a few minutes
[21:42] ago so Lord keep it down but who they
[21:47] man that they both Donnie you stay awake
[21:54] at least he's honest he's got toothpicks
[21:57] there you go I know it's rough listen
[22:01] it's rough but let's just focus just for
[22:03] a few minutes and then we'll then you
[22:06] know what then we'll go out stop for two
[22:07] hours and stand around talk anyway so
[22:12] anyways so the sixth seal is the
[22:14] Tribulation Period and luck of I'll say
[22:16] this again I'm gonna say it every
[22:18] service if I can remember it the
[22:20] greatest revelation if you never get
[22:22] another revelation is is that that Holy
[22:25] Ghost you got inside of you I was
[22:27] telling them downstairs in a Sunday
[22:29] School class that Holy Ghost this is it
[22:31] right here this is your whole ego okay
[22:33] this is my Holy Ghost I got it right
[22:34] here in my hand
[22:35] if you've got this Holy Ghost forget
[22:38] about the tribulation forget about the
[22:42] judgment forget about the millennium
[22:46] because you're going there then you're
[22:49] in a space capsule and you can't get out
[22:53] of it so if you got the Holy Ghost
[22:54] you're gonna be either if you pass away
[22:57] you're gonna be resurrected you're going
[23:00] to be changed you're going to go in a
[23:02] rapture you're going to go to the you
[23:06] missed one this morning wedding supper
[23:07] go to the wedding supper if you all will
[23:10] go back online brother Joe can pull it
[23:12] up for you about 15 years ago I preached
[23:15] the sermon on a timeline from Adam to
[23:16] the future home if you'll if you'll look
[23:18] at it online you can see the whole piece
[23:21] of paper and it's got it all sectioned
[23:23] out but I wish brother Dale would preach
[23:24] on a to preaching all and all it should
[23:26] go from Adam all the way to the future
[23:28] hold on amen
[23:29] but you got you got a free ticket a free
[23:34] trip that's what I was telling them
[23:36] downstairs we sometimes and then and I
[23:39] like to I like to delve into some of the
[23:43] finer points of the message but I really
[23:46] don't care what we're going to eat in a
[23:48] millennium I really don't care what
[23:49] we're going to and then you understand
[23:51] what I mean if I got the baptism of the
[23:53] Holy Ghost I don't know when I get there
[23:56] if I take a body change I were we where
[24:00] are we gonna go well it who cares really
[24:03] really come on people
[24:05] what street am I gonna able to live in
[24:07] in the future home and I told them
[24:13] downstairs I'm gonna tell you I said
[24:15] look there's a wall right here and
[24:16] that's called a body change until we
[24:20] understand that we're not going until we
[24:23] understand this all that is just
[24:26] frivolous things that that that people
[24:29] that you'll forget half of it but the
[24:31] body changed that's what we're looking
[24:34] at that's right here on our nose if
[24:36] you're looking for something look for
[24:38] the resurrection and the body change
[24:41] we're looking for the resurrection of
[24:44] the Dead Saints and until they resurrect
[24:46] we're just going to keep on going and
[24:48] then all of a sudden maybe one day we're
[24:50] going to be one of them but the sixth
[24:55] seal though it shows me that I don't
[24:57] have to go through the tribulation
[24:59] I've already been changed I've already
[25:03] went to where I remember I told you
[25:06] we've already been held
[25:10] theophany of God went to hell to preach
[25:12] to the souls and friends and if you've
[25:13] got that st. theophany in you today if
[25:16] you don't you got a different one you
[25:18] got that same theophany that theophany
[25:21] was already went to hell that theophany
[25:24] understands it was talking about Jesus
[25:27] walking on earth this morning if you
[25:28] want to watch that you can downstairs
[25:30] but I really think that but the Bible
[25:32] says Jesus learned by the things that he
[25:33] suffered and being made perfect became
[25:38] the author of our salvation eternal
[25:39] salvation amen
[25:41] so when he got when he was captured
[25:43] inside that human body there were some
[25:45] things that that he couldn't understand
[25:49] brother Ram said he know he didn't know
[25:51] about his second coming now you think me
[25:52] and Almighty God he'd know that but
[25:55] there were some things that had to
[25:56] filter through that brain of his just
[25:57] like through yours and I'm getting off
[25:59] the subject here sorry Aaron I'm going
[26:01] down the rabbit route praise the Lord
[26:03] I'm back now so forget about that so the
[26:06] sixth seal is the tribulation seal but
[26:08] if that seal opens to me and you listen
[26:11] if that still opens to me and you in a
[26:13] spiritual form we don't have to worry
[26:15] about that tribulation period we don't
[26:17] have to worry about sure there's going
[26:19] to be persecution and many things that
[26:21] are gonna they're gonna listen we're
[26:23] persecuted already look at that woman
[26:27] with a long hair looks like a
[26:28] grandmother he won't take he won't take
[26:31] a little beer he won't take a look who's
[26:33] he think he is
[26:34] see that's persecution but not only the
[26:35] degree is was that the foxes Book of
[26:37] Martyrs that was persecution but
[26:39] remember persecution comes from someone
[26:43] else all right it doesn't come I mean
[26:46] persecution is not having any money
[26:49] persecution is not having something to
[26:51] eat persecutions not having a car
[26:53] persecution is when one person
[26:56] persecutes another person that's why
[26:58] it's called persecution all right so
[27:01] we're we're persecuted already because
[27:04] of what we believe and like I was
[27:06] telling them downstairs we must be
[27:08] careful to not go into these things and
[27:14] and say well nobody's gonna know no
[27:16] listen the government knows everything
[27:18] we do they know our doctrine they know
[27:20] everything we do they know where we live
[27:21] they know our social security number
[27:23] they know what we say on the phone
[27:24] that Google if you've ever googled
[27:26] anything you're in their big Google mind
[27:28] up there somewhere and I know nobody in
[27:32] this building's ever googled anything
[27:34] mmm-hmm yeah and that guy setting the
[27:38] pet control towers going yeah you have
[27:40] but so so so let's not try to figure out
[27:44] let's don't do like somebody said well
[27:46] why don't we we need to put some
[27:48] aluminum fall over our head you know or
[27:50] or put some aluminum fall over our set
[27:52] list it's gonna be God Almighty that's
[27:54] gonna have to protect us there is
[27:56] nothing you can do to protect yourself
[27:59] you must be income income pass by the
[28:03] Word of God to get out of here oh you
[28:06] can try to figure out how we can do this
[28:08] or how we can survive this or how we can
[28:09] do this what does it matter they're
[28:12] going to know where we're at and listen
[28:16] this is how close it is this is how
[28:19] close it is do you know that when the
[28:20] terrorism 9/11 happen that terrorism
[28:24] attack set off a thing called the NSA
[28:28] the NSA now has total control of every
[28:33] National Security Alliance or whatever
[28:35] the Association or whatever it is so
[28:37] it's a national security thing
[28:38] everybody's under that and if you come
[28:41] out from under the norm you're
[28:43] considered a terrorist now what is the
[28:46] norm if you go into a religious realm
[28:48] the norm is every religion I don't care
[28:50] what it is every religion believes
[28:52] there's a Trinity they believe in water
[28:56] baptism the name Father Son Holy Ghost
[28:57] well they're sprinkling or poor and it's
[28:59] still basic you see all those basic
[29:01] doctrines we'll see we're not under that
[29:03] we've already been pulled out and put
[29:06] into another group because we are not
[29:08] normal accepted religion so being not
[29:13] accepted normal religion that means we
[29:15] are radical so we've been put over in
[29:18] the corner somewhere and you know what's
[29:19] gonna happen one day one day something's
[29:21] gonna happen and they're gonna ha notice
[29:23] but you know what there's nothing you
[29:26] can do to stop it it's already been
[29:29] foretold brother Rams already told us
[29:30] what was going to happen with money and
[29:32] with the Catholic Church and with
[29:34] everybody going under one system we know
[29:37] that's going to happen we're
[29:38] Darla's service a democrat or republican
[29:40] regardless of what people pass laws it
[29:42] doesn't matter but if you've got the
[29:45] Holy Ghost today you have missed the
[29:48] tribulation period you have missed the
[29:51] wrath of God poured out where everybody
[29:54] in the world Kings don't you think a
[29:57] king of Saudi Arabia could pay a billion
[29:59] dollars and have a whole army around him
[30:01] to keep somebody or get him doesn't
[30:04] matter because they're under the wrath
[30:07] of God they're not under the wrath of
[30:08] man this is God pouring out wrath on
[30:11] them now we know it's through man but we
[30:13] know the sixth seal though is the
[30:14] judgment seal so that judgment seal of
[30:17] the word is the sixth seal when it opens
[30:20] to you to me when it opens that tells
[30:22] you you've already been judged
[30:25] you've already been redeemed you've all
[30:28] your judgment is over because listen if
[30:31] not you've got to be judged by your
[30:33] works and being judged by your works you
[30:38] just might not make it but I'm judged by
[30:41] Jesus Christ works and if he made it I'm
[30:44] gonna make it hey man so that's the way
[30:47] I see this six he'll open is that I have
[30:50] put everything upon him he took my
[30:53] tribulation he took my persecution he
[30:57] took all these things at Calvary so that
[31:00] I don't have to so the sixth seal is the
[31:06] judgment seal of the entire Word of God
[31:09] when that 6dl opens in its natural form
[31:12] the whole world's going to be involved
[31:14] we just read it the whole world this is
[31:17] not just persecution on Israel and
[31:19] persecution on Germany and persecution
[31:21] in the United States sure we know the
[31:22] prophet of God said it starts here and
[31:24] works its way over there because listen
[31:27] we are the country that turned the
[31:28] Prophet down first we had a prophet come
[31:30] right out of our nation our own language
[31:35] and like I told you before we sent all
[31:37] them silly doctrines all over the world
[31:40] come right out of the United States the
[31:42] doctrines in the Philippines and then
[31:44] Jamaica in different places where we've
[31:46] been and know for sure where they come
[31:48] from and who took them over there they
[31:50] came from the United States so we're
[31:51] going
[31:52] get it first we're gonna get judgment
[31:55] first because we turned down the prophet
[31:57] of God in 1956 he said this that's a
[32:01] long time ago 1956 most people in this
[32:04] building weren't born yet some of you
[32:07] work like Terran said some you old ones
[32:11] real oh what'd you say that now I gotta
[32:16] tell them oh people it's open you know
[32:19] how look at you you're not old you're
[32:21] just heading toward a body change that's
[32:23] the way I see it so the sixth seal now
[32:26] let's let's skip this and go to number
[32:27] can't pull up number three who's back
[32:31] there today Anderson back there look
[32:34] okay good alright that's okay
[32:36] so well we'll let them get their dibs
[32:39] number three Anderson I said back there
[32:42] you went that means the little kids that
[32:46] means a little kids are back there
[32:47] they're not little kids they're grown me
[32:49] and they're growing up man that looked
[32:50] good to all them good good looking kid
[32:52] we got a bunch of good-looking kids
[32:53] you brought your mamas and daddies
[32:55] bearbie start praying baby praying long
[32:58] and hard
[32:59] amen yeah mm-hmm yeah so let's go to
[33:07] this and see we've already read this one
[33:09] time we're gonna read it again now we
[33:11] find out also the sixth seal now being
[33:13] opened it was for a three-fold purpose
[33:16] now here was the purposes the first
[33:18] thing was that the sleeping virgin had
[33:20] to go through the tribulation now his
[33:22] brother Dale was talking about all in
[33:24] all remember one thing eternal life is
[33:27] eternal life but there are degrees of
[33:29] eternal life you and I receive eternal
[33:31] life here because we are newborn babes
[33:36] so you might say we are we were born
[33:38] wrong and then we got born again God
[33:41] filled our soul with eternal life while
[33:44] we are living and breathing on the face
[33:47] of the earth okay that's one group now
[33:52] the foolish virgin is going to be given
[33:54] eternal life but there are another group
[33:56] it's going to be imparted to them at the
[33:59] white throne judgment everybody got that
[34:01] same man oh you that are awake
[34:05] the first thing was asleep but now what
[34:07] do they have to do they got to go
[34:09] through a persecution of their own of
[34:13] their own they got to go to a
[34:16] persecution be killed for what they
[34:18] believe and then given eternal life at
[34:21] the white room for their stand for the
[34:23] gospel that they understand while
[34:26] they're here
[34:26] yes that's almost a direct quote from
[34:29] brother Branham cuz a sleeping virgin
[34:31] they are virgins but they were not
[34:34] taught look the first thing was the
[34:39] sleeping virgins had to go through the
[34:40] tribulation period for purification you
[34:42] and I I hope if we'll understand this
[34:45] will come to that body change we'll come
[34:47] to the right our purifications already
[34:49] here everything we need and everything
[34:53] we got in the new birth has already took
[34:57] care of all that she had to be purged
[35:03] for her sins of unbelief and rejecting
[35:05] the message this she was done in the
[35:08] tribulation period we see they wind up
[35:10] over in revelation 7 between the 6th and
[35:12] 7th chapter that she has been purged and
[35:15] she's been giving her robes now she's
[35:17] not the bride she's the church she will
[35:21] be imparted eternal life she didn't
[35:24] possess it she will be given eternal
[35:27] life at the white zone judgment all
[35:28] right but the bride we already have it
[35:31] here man
[35:36] to receive have an opportunity to
[35:38] receive the message or in some way they
[35:40] were blinded by false prophets we see
[35:42] that going on now and they didn't get a
[35:44] chance and yet they're really sincere
[35:46] and hard and God knows they're hard and
[35:48] here they're purged during this time now
[35:51] that's the first purging the second
[35:53] purging you'll notice another purging
[35:54] time that's for Israel when she gathers
[35:56] now look Israel remember I went through
[35:58] all that in the fifth seal Israel was
[36:01] jeet was God's first bride Israel was
[36:06] God's first bride she went whoring
[36:09] against other idols and other gods and
[36:12] God had what she tried to fool around
[36:14] with another man God had to put her away
[36:19] and give her a billing of divorcement
[36:21] divorced her and married the bride the
[36:25] man you can do that remember in marriage
[36:28] and divorce hello if you catch your wife
[36:33] riding around on some bye on you you can
[36:35] put her away marry somebody else and
[36:37] she's just she's not gonna ever be
[36:38] restored back coach can't take her back
[36:40] you can't take her back because she's
[36:42] polluted we went through all that during
[36:44] the fifth seal because what happened was
[36:47] Israel turn Christ's down at the cross
[36:49] so that put that 144,000 they're gonna
[36:53] get eternal life but they're gonna be in
[36:55] another position not bright anymore he
[36:58] can't marry her again he gave Mary as
[37:01] his divorced wife again you can't do
[37:04] that said even says in the Bible you
[37:05] can't do that in a natural sense so God
[37:08] surely couldn't do it in a spiritual
[37:09] sense so he sends Israel through the
[37:11] Tribulation Period twelve thousand out
[37:14] of each tribe 12 tribes 144,000 see out
[37:17] of the millions that will gather there's
[37:18] not just all Israel there will be a
[37:21] selected 144,000 and they will be purged
[37:25] what they'll be persecuted they'll be
[37:27] killed along with the two prophets
[37:29] they'll be killed then that what they
[37:32] will be caught up and then Armageddon
[37:37] begins all right and then notice there's
[37:40] a whole earth to be purged there will be
[37:43] such a thing that the moon stars and all
[37:45] nature will be purged you see what it is
[37:47] the earth is renewing herself being
[37:49] purged getting ready for the Millennium
[37:52] the millenniums coming up and see
[37:54] everything that's got any filth in it is
[37:56] to be purged during the sixth seal all
[38:00] right everybody got that say man all
[38:02] right that would be at the Battle of
[38:06] Armageddon going into the millennium
[38:07] where everything is going to be cleaned
[38:09] off so that us and Christ can come back
[38:12] to the earth but there's got some things
[38:15] happen before that so let's go to number
[38:17] four we read it last Sunday and we're
[38:21] talking about and I want to I want to
[38:23] stop for just a second on this but let's
[38:26] read it first brother Branham in 1964
[38:28] she long service to Arizona I read this
[38:30] last Sunday we all know that's the
[38:31] identification we know
[38:33] what the third pull is cuz everybody's
[38:34] worried about what the third pull it we
[38:37] all we all understand that now you got
[38:39] you'll have to take you'll have the tape
[38:40] see and I think it'll just lay dormant
[38:42] for a little while until the great hour
[38:44] of persecution you and I are not being
[38:47] persecuted at the moment like that kind
[38:50] of persecution then when it be it'll
[38:55] speak it'll manifest just like the five
[38:58] straight signs remember brother Brown
[38:59] one two five straight times perfectly
[39:01] now think just wait and see what it done
[39:03] and I'm going he's in other words he's
[39:04] going back out find out way back out to
[39:07] Jefferson billing things what he's
[39:08] talking about
[39:09] so the third pull then lays dormant now
[39:12] watch number five blow up number five
[39:20] ninety once at the end time I noticed
[39:22] the very day when this message no this
[39:24] is right after he preached that watch
[39:25] not when he starts on but when he begins
[39:28] to declare his message now we know for
[39:30] sure brother branham's message was the
[39:32] opening of the seven seals not to
[39:34] healing campaign not to not the signs in
[39:38] the hand and all that it was the opening
[39:40] of those seven seals that no man had
[39:42] ever looked on except brother branham
[39:44] Christ preached them and brother Branham
[39:46] brought them to our attention that's
[39:48] what we're trying to see now we're not
[39:50] trying to see just that the wild horse
[39:52] rider was the Antichrist no there's a
[39:54] lot more to that that was the seal that
[39:56] broke when that seal broke that was more
[39:58] for us to understand if not what they
[40:00] would have took a rapture in 1963 right
[40:03] all right so now not when he starts on
[40:06] but when he begins to declare his
[40:08] message see first pull healing second
[40:11] pull prophesying third pull opening of
[40:14] the word the mysteries revealed no more
[40:17] there's no more higher order to reveal
[40:19] the word than prophets now what did
[40:21] brother Brown say previous to that that
[40:23] the the third pull would lay dormant now
[40:25] that doesn't mean two words laying
[40:26] dormant the words in action it's when
[40:30] the third pull is needed which is what
[40:33] the speaking of the word what happened
[40:35] under the third pull of brother rounds
[40:37] ministry he spoke the word and something
[40:39] happened
[40:40] no squirrels there were squirrels no
[40:44] salvation there was salvation
[40:47] storm now there's no storm sister Mita
[40:50] had the thing on her side those
[40:52] different things you understand what I'm
[40:53] saying so you and I have come to a place
[40:56] that even we've got to come to this
[40:58] third pool ministry part before the
[41:02] rapture can take place because the third
[41:04] pull is the opening of the word the
[41:06] mysteries revealed no more higher order
[41:10] to reveal the word than profits so we've
[41:11] had the profit here now we've got the
[41:14] profit - Holy Ghost the only way the
[41:16] profit can be vindicated is by the word
[41:18] and remember the third pole with the
[41:20] opening of them seven seals to reveal
[41:22] the hidden truth that's been sealed in
[41:24] the word do you see it the congregation
[41:25] says Amen but you got to remember their
[41:27] brother Branham told that same group of
[41:29] people
[41:29] that's jeffersonville's two years after
[41:31] he preached the seals that they went for
[41:34] them they wasn't getting it in other
[41:35] words it was sealed right back up it was
[41:38] sealed back up and it laid dormant until
[41:39] now until today you and I today because
[41:43] you and I remember I preached a long
[41:46] time we're going I think Bob kind of
[41:47] pulled on it a little bit the other name
[41:49] how much the three poles of our journey
[41:51] you and I must have three poles you and
[41:54] I must go through the sword in the hand
[41:56] and all these different things brother
[41:58] Branham was a type showing the bride had
[42:00] to come to these things not one man
[42:02] brother Branham coming got he was the
[42:05] first-fruit a man he was the one that
[42:07] first received it but he didn't keep it
[42:10] he give it to the bride you and I have
[42:12] it now hey man you and I have the full
[42:15] opening of the word now he didn't take
[42:16] it with him he's got to come back and
[42:17] bring it to us hello you and I are
[42:21] recipients of this the opening of the
[42:24] words for the first ball well first pool
[42:26] is healing that types what justification
[42:31] God heals you at justification amen
[42:36] he did me you know what he healed me
[42:38] from all that sin I did in the past amen
[42:42] that'll never come back anymore that's
[42:44] permanent that was true justification he
[42:47] justified me the first pull and you know
[42:50] what it's not a push it's a pull he's
[42:53] pulling you into these things you're not
[42:55] you're you know that's our problem
[42:56] sometimes we push ourselves into stuff
[42:59] remember brother Bram said you didn't
[43:01] seek God God sought you he pulled you
[43:06] Paul he pulls you into justification he
[43:10] pulls you into sanctification second
[43:12] Paul prophesying you get to understand
[43:15] more of the Word of God even brother
[43:16] Branham says your name is put on the
[43:17] book as a believer in sanctification and
[43:21] then so you're walking through and you
[43:23] are looking at you say what's prophesy
[43:25] men prophesying is I read and see what
[43:29] brother branham's taught said about me I
[43:30] look and see what God's already said
[43:32] about me that's that's them prophesying
[43:35] about me when you read the Bible it
[43:39] should be talking to you about you this
[43:42] message should be as we read the message
[43:45] brother Branham wasn't talking to that
[43:47] group of people he had in front of it
[43:49] was talking to me and you because you
[43:51] and I are the recipients the finality of
[43:54] all this coming together the third pull
[43:57] the opening the word which is the
[43:58] opening of the seven seals we believe
[44:00] this in time it has happened in this
[44:02] time our time but it took a prophet to
[44:08] bring us the word but when he broke
[44:10] broke the word to us
[44:11] he didn't take you back with him he gave
[44:16] it out to us thank God for God sending a
[44:21] prophet but think of that look through
[44:26] your journey what does three mean three
[44:28] is what perfection you are perfected in
[44:31] threes brother Brian was ministry was
[44:34] perfected in threes because the first
[44:36] pull was healing he went right on
[44:38] through that had a bunch of carnal /
[44:39] impersonators a lot of people did the
[44:42] same thing he did but they didn't have a
[44:45] message then you come to second pull
[44:48] prophesying here we go brother Branham
[44:51] prophesied telling us of all these
[44:52] things that's going to happen but when
[44:54] he come to that third Pole that he said
[44:56] that was the greatest realm I ever
[44:58] worked in more healing than even Jesus
[45:01] Christ yet he said the opening of the
[45:03] word was the greatest an Ordnung he'd
[45:05] ever worked under so you and I must see
[45:08] it's the greatest anointing that we have
[45:09] worker there is the opening of the word
[45:11] so that the mysteries can be revealed
[45:14] then I told you last Sunday or Sunday
[45:16] before left there's only one mystery is
[45:20] that God can hide himself in you that's
[45:24] only one mystery left is Satan cannot
[45:27] believe that you say who you say you are
[45:30] and he's going to make you prove it to
[45:37] me that's the great mystery whatever
[45:38] what other mystery is there if Christ
[45:41] was the Seventh Seal he was a total
[45:44] mystery to the world total mystery he
[45:47] hung on Calvary by itself nobody
[45:50] understood who he was so you think we're
[45:53] gonna have a big crowd hanging around us
[45:55] no no not when we do like I said when we
[45:59] get to where we say I and my father won
[46:00] and these other things the Shutts gonna
[46:02] pull away people are not gonna be able
[46:04] to swallow that especially the
[46:06] denominational world cuz they're going
[46:08] to do just like they did Jesus they're
[46:10] gonna say you a man making yourself God
[46:16] no it's God has made itself into me and
[46:20] you not a second person not another
[46:24] person the same person almighty garden
[46:29] human flesh called a bride amen
[46:32] alright let's go to number six and be
[46:35] alright with that
[46:36] so you how you put yourself in the
[46:38] journey in the three pools is God
[46:40] pulling you through God's pulling you up
[46:42] the statue of a perfect man he's pulling
[46:44] you to a body change and that's gonna
[46:48] pull the dead Saints on the ground I
[46:50] don't know what people's looking for I
[46:53] don't I I'm not searching for what other
[46:56] people are searching for this code word
[46:58] or this prophet to come back or this
[47:04] I thought Moses even said that we go
[47:07] look for Christ over here we go look for
[47:08] him over hundred and he said he's
[47:10] neither even in thy mouth the word of
[47:13] faith that you preach so where are we
[47:15] looking for God out that's what we're
[47:18] looking for look at we're looking for
[47:20] some great something to get us
[47:22] emotionally stirred up when Jesus was
[47:28] hanging on Calvary he was not
[47:29] emotionally stirred up he was dying but
[47:33] he was dying for me and you amen all
[47:38] right that Easter proved it he wasn't
[47:40] only the word he was God himself the
[47:42] dynamics in the word that made the body
[47:45] of Jesus Christ cold stiff and dead in
[47:47] the grave
[47:48] shake into life and rise again and roll
[47:50] away the stone I am he that was dead so
[47:54] dead till the son said he was dead the
[47:55] moon said he was dead the star said he
[47:58] was dead all nature said he was dead and
[48:01] now the whole world has to recognize
[48:03] that he's alive again how is that in me
[48:05] and you there's no other way for them to
[48:08] realize it he was not only the mechanics
[48:12] God's Word he was the dynamics to prove
[48:14] it and as he being the groom the bride
[48:18] has to come forth cuz it's part of him
[48:22] and it can only be the manifestation of
[48:25] the fulfilling of all look the bride the
[48:30] bride the bride it is the bride and the
[48:35] bride can only be the manifestation of
[48:37] the fulfilling of all the revelations
[48:38] any others have spoke of the bride it's
[48:42] the bride that will have to be
[48:44] manifested in the end time if it does
[48:47] something different from the groom it
[48:49] isn't the bride so listen all these
[48:51] people that are leaving the message and
[48:52] all these people are preaching false
[48:53] doctrine leave him alone leave him alone
[48:58] if they are not preaching the word leave
[49:01] him alone
[49:03] because she is flesh of his flesh bone
[49:07] of his bone no I'm sorry let's go but if
[49:11] it does something different from the
[49:13] groom it isn't the bride because she is
[49:17] flesh of his flesh
[49:18] bone of his bone life of his life power
[49:21] of his power she is like him because if
[49:31] she is like him she's the devil
[49:34] if she's like him do you understand what
[49:37] I'm saying if she is like him she is the
[49:39] devil
[49:39] she is him as man and woman are one and
[49:45] woman taken from his side she had taken
[49:48] a spirit the feminist spirit from him
[49:50] the flesh from his side made both
[49:51] mechanics and dynamics the wife listen
[49:54] as we said before when Eve appeared
[49:58] before Adam she was the same person he
[50:01] was except for the feminist part inside
[50:05] her flesh was his flesh her bone was his
[50:09] bone her blood was his blood we got to
[50:15] be the same way the spirit of him and
[50:21] the flesh of him and put it together and
[50:25] made mechanics and dynamics until that
[50:28] church becomes both dynamics and
[50:30] mechanics and the Spirit of God that
[50:32] moved him to do the things he did if he
[50:35] hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride
[50:37] for he said in John 14 12 he that
[50:40] believeth on me the works that I do
[50:41] shall he do also
[50:42] I'll give him a charge of my dynamics in
[50:45] his mechanics excuse me that the world
[50:50] will not be able to withstand it there's
[50:52] your third pole the world will not be
[50:56] able to stand in front of you and me if
[50:59] we have what we say we're supposed to
[51:02] have coming up to the end to the
[51:04] persecution part listen it's gonna take
[51:08] a miracle for somebody to stand here and
[51:10] take a body change and not be killed an
[51:14] absolute miracle
[51:17] I'll give him a charge of my dynamics
[51:20] and I'll raise him up again to the last
[51:21] day that's the Easter message the
[51:24] dynamics everybody know the mechanics is
[51:26] what the word the dynamics is them as
[51:28] the word is the
[51:31] firing of the word the mechanics without
[51:33] the dynamics no good
[51:35] you have the car with the with the motor
[51:38] but no gas it's worthless neither is the
[51:40] dynamics without the mechanics you can
[51:42] scream shout and jump up and down all
[51:43] you want to and deny this word it won't
[51:46] do you any good
[51:47] you're just cranking around the Pistons
[51:49] got the spark there to fire but no
[51:50] gasoline to fire it by it only works as
[51:53] they come together comes together one
[51:59] will sit still the other will go up
[52:00] that's the only thing there is to it yet
[52:02] they both might look like we know what
[52:04] he's talking about the church nominal
[52:05] and the church spiritual look yet they
[52:09] might look alike both claim to be
[52:12] churches both claim to be bright but one
[52:14] has mechanics and dynamics it brings it
[52:18] to pass of what he said it's the truth
[52:19] it just won't move no matter how good
[52:22] the mechanic says until the dynamics
[52:24] come when the dynamics come that fire is
[52:27] made to connect with that octane in the
[52:29] gasoline and then that explodes it
[52:32] causes the combustion and that
[52:33] combustion moves every motion ever move
[52:35] freeze the same yesterday today and
[52:37] forever
[52:38] that is the resurrection that is the
[52:43] resurrection all right let's go to the
[52:45] next one number seven it's the rising of
[52:52] the Sun this is paragraph 168 that's the
[52:56] divine revelation of the word made flesh
[52:59] if it was flesh in that day by the Sun
[53:03] the groom it's the flesh today by the
[53:07] bride
[53:10] whosoever sins you remit to them they
[53:12] are remitted whosoever sins you retain
[53:14] to them they are retained now the
[53:16] Catholic Church picked that up and takes
[53:18] it to the priest but that's carnal watch
[53:20] it was the spiritual revealed word that
[53:24] did it and that's what's gonna do it for
[53:25] you and I the spiritually revealed word
[53:27] not just quotes not just being able to
[53:32] quote being able to being the
[53:35] spiritually revealed word that did it so
[53:39] now if you can see that can you see this
[53:43] next scripture
[53:45] though the next go to the next color
[53:47] scripture and the word was made flesh
[53:50] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[53:55] glory now wall now hold now my brother
[53:58] listen Jesus they glorified them with
[54:05] the same glory that I was glorified with
[54:09] in John st. John 17 you and I are the
[54:14] glory brother Brown said we are the
[54:16] victory the bride is the victory of
[54:19] Christ without us his work was not
[54:22] fulfilled without us the word has to be
[54:26] made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[54:28] beheld his glory the glory of the only
[54:29] begotten of the Father now listen we
[54:32] know this has not begotten of the father
[54:33] but what's inside of you is if it's not
[54:37] you are second person and you are the
[54:39] devil you were begotten by the father
[54:41] you are born again full of grace and
[54:44] truth that's you if it spiritually
[54:50] revealed that's you all right if it
[54:53] spiritually revealed you have no problem
[54:56] with saying I am the Word made flesh now
[55:05] have we come to that so let's read again
[55:06] number eight he's not Arab with a shock
[55:11] then Along Came sanctification how many
[55:13] believes in sanctification you believe
[55:15] the Bible you have to sure so still
[55:17] that's not it's a little more like
[55:19] there's two more words but then come the
[55:22] Pentecost the restoration of the gift
[55:24] speaking in tongues they call it the
[55:25] initial evidence of the Holy Ghost
[55:26] peeking in tongues there they call that
[55:29] the initial evidence which brought forth
[55:30] to what the shuk but they denominated
[55:33] but when you come to say I and my father
[55:38] are one
[55:39] and these other things
[55:42] then the ship pulls away from it some
[55:47] will not be able to stand what we're
[55:50] preaching I don't mean just we in this
[55:53] church I mean we as the brighter
[55:54] coming to a place that if we don't start
[55:56] saying I my father one we're gonna be
[55:59] saying he looks good in a cast it I'm
[56:06] just telling you the truth
[56:08] we must see this and it must come in a
[56:12] quickening form
[56:14] that's why somebody's got to start
[56:16] preaching it somebody's got to start
[56:17] getting the people to believe who they
[56:20] already are I'm my father 1 and these
[56:24] other things then the shut pulls away
[56:26] why the shook ain't the shucks ain't the
[56:30] wheat the shucks the covering it at one
[56:34] time it had life in it God come through
[56:39] the stock God come through I mean come
[56:41] through the two ears he comes through
[56:44] the stop God come through the shucks now
[56:47] he's in the wheat that's what he's into
[56:49] now he's not into the stock stocks dried
[56:51] up already gone he had life in it at one
[56:53] time Luther it had life into it Wesley
[56:56] had life into it Pentecost but once you
[56:58] come back to the genuine wine the real
[57:02] genuine wine bride church will bring
[57:06] forth the entire Word of God in its
[57:10] fullness in its strength for he's the
[57:12] same yesterday today and forever I'm
[57:15] just telling you what he's already
[57:16] saying about us then alright but when
[57:21] you come to say he didn't say when I
[57:23] told myself he said when you come to say
[57:27] I and my father of one and these other
[57:30] things listen you got to start
[57:33] confessing it before it's a possession
[57:35] confession leads to profoundly
[57:38] profession leads to possession but the
[57:41] real genuine Brian Church will bring
[57:43] forth the entire Word of God in its
[57:46] fullness and in its strength for he's
[57:48] the same yesterday today and forever can
[57:51] you stand it John 14 17 and I will pray
[57:57] the father and he shall give you another
[57:59] comforter that he may abide with you
[58:01] forever even the Spirit of Truth whom
[58:04] the world cannot receive all right guys
[58:07] the world can't receive
[58:08] this German talking gate I think what's
[58:19] happening now is birthday cake Germans
[58:24] out the gate birthday cake some kind of
[58:25] cake thank you
[58:29] even the Spirit of Truth whom the world
[58:31] cannot receive listen the world can't
[58:38] speak our language
[58:40] they can't even live wait and listen and
[58:45] it's not that we're hearing their hear
[58:47] God's made us this way God's equipped us
[58:51] with what we need to do something that
[58:53] no one else in the world even Jesus
[58:55] Christ Himself did not he had to die but
[58:59] he died for you so that you don't have
[59:01] to but somebody's gonna stand on this
[59:03] earth and say death you don't even have
[59:06] a stinger anymore whom the world cannot
[59:11] receive because it seeth him not seeing
[59:14] it does not understand neither knoweth
[59:17] him listen folks most and I heard a
[59:20] preacher the other day and he did a
[59:21] really good job
[59:22] most people live off of historical Jesus
[59:26] Christ the historical God God did
[59:29] something at Calvary for me but they
[59:31] can't get him off the cross they keep
[59:33] him back there 2,000 years and you know
[59:35] what in their position maybe that's all
[59:37] they can see and listen Jesus said
[59:40] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[59:41] thou shalt be saved but you got to
[59:43] believe that he come inside of you not
[59:45] that he's still hanging on that cross
[59:46] listen it's not a historical God it's an
[59:49] I am ever-present God that's what the
[59:53] Prophet brought us he tried that he
[59:55] tried to tell him people that God was
[59:57] right there with him there was not a
[1:00:00] historical God even the Spirit of Truth
[1:00:05] whom the world cannot receive because it
[1:00:07] see if they understand us him not
[1:00:09] neither knoweth him but you know him for
[1:00:13] he dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[1:00:16] I personal pronoun will not leave you
[1:00:21] comfortless
[1:00:22] I will come to you yet a little while
[1:00:27] and the world understandeth me no more
[1:00:32] but you understand me and my change in
[1:00:35] the Bible
[1:00:36] no but you understand me good listen
[1:00:41] we're not we can't physically see Christ
[1:00:43] but we know he's inside of us right but
[1:00:46] ye understand him because I live you
[1:00:51] shall live also that day the prophet
[1:00:55] said this day you shall know it doesn't
[1:00:59] say you will guess or you might he says
[1:01:04] you shall know that I am you ever heard
[1:01:08] that before
[1:01:08] I am in my father and ye in me and I in
[1:01:16] you now most of the people can see but
[1:01:20] look what's what - look watch what the
[1:01:22] Trinitarian doctrine does it can't see
[1:01:25] him in the Father because they see two
[1:01:26] people and then I and you as the Holy
[1:01:31] Ghost that's another person but all I
[1:01:33] see right there is a spiritual union of
[1:01:38] one person one person I am in my father
[1:01:46] and ye and me that's the problem because
[1:01:49] it takes you into me but now remember
[1:01:51] you and I the first bride came out of
[1:01:54] item the second bride has to go back in
[1:02:01] hello we came out of his side at Calvary
[1:02:05] but we got to go back into his side
[1:02:06] because ye and me and I knew that's one
[1:02:09] person I and my father one and these
[1:02:13] other things there's a three-fold manner
[1:02:20] here just like it was in the three poles
[1:02:22] trees is perfection I and my father yeah
[1:02:27] and me and I knew it's a journey we know
[1:02:32] that when the Holy Ghost comes inside of
[1:02:33] you that makes you
[1:02:35] Almighty in human flesh but can we see
[1:02:42] you and cost being the same person
[1:02:48] that's hard to believe but I'm just
[1:02:52] telling you what he said I'm in my
[1:02:55] father you're in me and I in you we are
[1:02:59] one I came from God I'd go back to God
[1:03:05] amen
[1:03:06] all right let's read nine and ten and
[1:03:08] then we'll start in communion here you
[1:03:14] him nineteen sixty now you see Jesus had
[1:03:17] proven to God that he'd been the right
[1:03:18] kind of son see this no all right this
[1:03:20] is our journey and then next Sunday
[1:03:22] we'll talk a little bit more about into
[1:03:24] the journey because we we have to go
[1:03:26] through a journey this is not just all
[1:03:27] of a sudden we're gonna just jump right
[1:03:29] in and be manifested sons of God no we
[1:03:31] got to come to that all right we got a
[1:03:34] journey to go through all right like we
[1:03:37] were talking last night and get this
[1:03:39] listen we have to have faith we have to
[1:03:43] believe but that's the vehicle now look
[1:03:46] I don't have to believe and have faith
[1:03:48] that I'm in church today because in my
[1:03:52] journey I'm gonna believe my car's gonna
[1:03:54] get me the church I'm gonna believe I'm
[1:03:56] gonna get up in the morning and I
[1:03:58] believe that my clothes are gonna be
[1:03:59] ready to go and I knew that Jim don't so
[1:04:01] it's my fault funnel dress right so I
[1:04:03] come to church and then I say I believe
[1:04:06] I'm gonna go to church today now I'm
[1:04:08] already here faith is the substance of
[1:04:12] things hoped for the evidence of things
[1:04:15] not seen
[1:04:16] I didn't see myself for church but I had
[1:04:18] faith that I was coming here but that
[1:04:20] faith ended when I got to church your
[1:04:23] faith ends when you see your God
[1:04:30] when you see your God your faith is over
[1:04:34] it is finished now listen we believe to
[1:04:39] healing that's only temporary you can
[1:04:43] die the same thing two weeks ago and
[1:04:45] have supernatural faith to believe God
[1:04:47] can heal you cancer and two weeks later
[1:04:48] die cancer that's not what I'm talking
[1:04:51] about I'm told that when we realize who
[1:04:54] we are and what we're doing here
[1:04:56] Satan will not be able to bring that
[1:04:59] death ticket and put it in our face he
[1:05:06] closed them in immortality we'll talk
[1:05:08] about that a little more next time
[1:05:09] mm-hmm because really faith is the
[1:05:12] journey believing is journey I don't
[1:05:13] listen I have to have faith there's a
[1:05:15] future home but now I shouldn't because
[1:05:21] I'm taking it with me this is my future
[1:05:24] home according to brother Branham
[1:05:25] according to the Bible John saw it
[1:05:26] coming out of heaven as a bride adorned
[1:05:28] for her husband why's a bride always
[1:05:29] gotta be attached to this does this mean
[1:05:32] you you have your home and your street
[1:05:36] number already where you sitting right
[1:05:38] now because the city won't be complete
[1:05:41] without you God is not complete without
[1:05:45] you if you ever heard that before he
[1:05:47] clothed him in mortality remember this
[1:05:49] is Matthew 17 when he took him on the
[1:05:51] mountain but now remember see that was
[1:05:52] temporary Oh be careful that was
[1:05:56] temporary
[1:05:57] he didn't Jesus didn't become immortal
[1:06:00] on that mountain
[1:06:01] no he died at Calvary about six months
[1:06:03] later but it was showing that you and I
[1:06:07] can come to that because the first son's
[1:06:09] already come to it
[1:06:10] potentially he didn't become immortal
[1:06:13] till the day of Easter morning when he
[1:06:15] said all power in him and there's been
[1:06:17] getting under me that was a mortal that
[1:06:19] had become immortal but God shows us
[1:06:22] these things in our journey to keep us
[1:06:24] what pulling he keeps pulling us to our
[1:06:29] destination but we must confess to
[1:06:36] possess Amen His garment shine like the
[1:06:40] Sun watch a supernatural son
[1:06:42] thing taking place his garments
[1:06:44] glistened like the Sun in the middle of
[1:06:46] the day it's white as they could be God
[1:06:49] placed on him that robe of immortality
[1:06:53] showing that he had received him read
[1:07:00] that next sentence that's the thing that
[1:07:03] God will do to his sons here on earth
[1:07:08] some day huh you believe God sent a
[1:07:16] prophet you believe the prophets right
[1:07:18] you believe prophets talking to you
[1:07:20] about you right there is what he said
[1:07:24] God will do to his sons here on earth
[1:07:29] someday he will call you a side Church
[1:07:32] if you'll only obey Him and stay on the
[1:07:34] word and believe it he will place into
[1:07:36] the church before the coming of Jesus
[1:07:40] Christ he will place into the church all
[1:07:42] the powers hello's them by all the
[1:07:45] powers that Christ had in him will be in
[1:07:48] the church all that God was he poured
[1:07:50] into Jesus all the Jesus what he poured
[1:07:52] into the church God wanting his working
[1:07:56] done he sent it into his son the son
[1:08:00] warning the work done sent it into the
[1:08:03] church and that day you'll know that I
[1:08:06] am the father father me and I in you and
[1:08:07] you and me at that day because the same
[1:08:10] power of God was in Jehovah God rested
[1:08:13] in Jesus Christ
[1:08:14] the same power that rested in Jesus
[1:08:17] Christ rest into place sons and the body
[1:08:20] of Christ
[1:08:21] placing up a son take him out in a
[1:08:23] certain place have a ceremony before
[1:08:25] angels place him positionally what is he
[1:08:28] isn't what he is in the body of Christ
[1:08:29] then that person has the authority let
[1:08:34] me say this if you count me a fanatic
[1:08:37] from this night on that very same thing
[1:08:41] that I'm speaking of will be done and
[1:08:47] hold on it just didn't say him there'll
[1:08:50] be a power putting to the bride
[1:08:54] and now is coming in that the holy
[1:08:57] spirit will so anoint the people till
[1:08:59] they'll speak the word and it'll create
[1:09:01] itself right there we haven't seen
[1:09:05] powers lights coming into the church now
[1:09:08] I know it for a fact saying to this
[1:09:12] mountain be moved don't doubt in your
[1:09:14] heart but believe what you've said shall
[1:09:17] come to pass it can have you can have
[1:09:20] what you've said the placing of the
[1:09:22] church in position where the fullness of
[1:09:25] the power of the Holy Ghost comes into
[1:09:27] the church then critics mouth what the
[1:09:30] shuck will be shut up it'll be a short
[1:09:34] time you hear me it'll be a short time
[1:09:38] well the ramps gonna be a short time
[1:09:39] Jesus came right off the mountain went
[1:09:41] straight to Calvary notice it won't last
[1:09:44] long
[1:09:45] but it'll be here that's your prophet
[1:09:48] talking about you one more name will
[1:09:51] finish the Uniting time ensign 1963
[1:09:55] right after the seal to preach What did
[1:09:58] he say Malachi 4 would restore restore
[1:10:00] back the original Pentecostal faith back
[1:10:03] to the people with the same Pentecostal
[1:10:05] message the same Pentecostal sign the
[1:10:07] same Pentecostal evidence the same God
[1:10:09] the same power the same teaching
[1:10:11] everything is actually with the
[1:10:13] vindication of the same pillar fire
[1:10:15] they've struck Paul down on the road
[1:10:17] down to Damascus amongst us today doing
[1:10:20] the same thing he did in that day
[1:10:22] uniting we see the nation's you 90s
[1:10:29] that's what we're all worried about go
[1:10:31] well this is doing this and this we're
[1:10:32] doing them what about us what about our
[1:10:35] uniting time we see the churches uniting
[1:10:39] we see the bride uniting uniting with
[1:10:42] the word why the word is God and as the
[1:10:45] word as the bridegroom being the word
[1:10:48] and the bride being the Hemmer of the
[1:10:51] word they come together in a union they
[1:10:55] unite like a wedding see they're getting
[1:10:57] ready for a wedding and they become one
[1:10:59] the word becomes u-haul wait a minute
[1:11:01] brother branham the word becomes you and
[1:11:03] you become the word john 1:14
[1:11:08] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:11:11] among us I'm telling you what the
[1:11:13] Prophet said about you as the bridegroom
[1:11:14] being the word and the bride being the
[1:11:17] hear of the word they come together in
[1:11:19] the union they unite like a wedding see
[1:11:21] they're getting ready for a wedding and
[1:11:24] they become one the word becomes you and
[1:11:26] you become the word jesus said that that
[1:11:29] day you know what all the father is I am
[1:11:32] all that I am you are and all you are I
[1:11:37] am in that day you'll know that I'm in
[1:11:41] the father the father and me I and you
[1:11:44] and you and me see at that day what day
[1:11:46] this day we find out the great hidden
[1:11:50] mysteries now what's the hidden mystery
[1:11:52] I and you and you and me that's the
[1:11:55] hidden mystery the hidden mystery is is
[1:11:56] that where God made manifest look we're
[1:11:58] not just a bride we have that title sure
[1:12:03] but I thought he said we were having the
[1:12:04] Uniting time where the two come together
[1:12:07] to make what one we find out the great
[1:12:10] hidden mysteries of God being revealed
[1:12:12] oh how I like that he and George what he
[1:12:16] was saying amen you enjoy what you enjoy
[1:12:20] what he's saying about you that's what
[1:12:23] he said he said I in you and you and me
[1:12:26] all I am you are and all you are I am he
[1:12:33] turned that thing around and he's
[1:12:34] looking right at us and he said what I
[1:12:36] am you are and what you are I am so
[1:12:42] Jesus Christ does not have a problem
[1:12:44] with saying who you are because you're
[1:12:48] him you're him you're him made manifest
[1:12:54] in another form called a bride that's
[1:12:57] what to me the sixth seal shows me that
[1:13:00] I am so sanctified
[1:13:03] I remember the fifth seal we talked as
[1:13:05] justification the highest form the real
[1:13:07] you didn't do it because the fifth seal
[1:13:09] Jew he can't see their sin the real Jew
[1:13:12] didn't the real person didn't do that or
[1:13:14] he would couldn't give him eternal life
[1:13:16] he given me eternal life because he
[1:13:17] blinded their eyes right now we come to
[1:13:20] the sixth and we see a toll of distress
[1:13:22] and of nature we see that he so cleans
[1:13:24] the earth off until he can walk on it he
[1:13:28] can walk on the earth after the sixth
[1:13:31] seal naturally opens Christ the seventh
[1:13:34] seal can appear on the earth with his
[1:13:37] bride he's not by itself he's got
[1:13:38] somebody with him he's got his complete
[1:13:40] bride body with him during that time so
[1:13:43] what does the sixth seal sure it's the
[1:13:45] tribulation seal sure it's the the seal
[1:13:47] that that's a horrible seal to the world
[1:13:49] but if you're sealed into Christ it's
[1:13:51] not horrible for you it's the greatest
[1:13:54] part of you that you're so sanctified
[1:13:57] that God sees his self in you he sees
[1:14:02] himself in you not as another person but
[1:14:07] as the person of Jesus Christ on the
[1:14:09] earth called the bride can you swallow
[1:14:12] that list and I'm not gonna actually can
[1:14:19] you swallow it I'm asked can you make it
[1:14:21] manifest because we got to that's our
[1:14:23] mandate our mandate is to be Jesus
[1:14:27] Christ on this earth because he said I
[1:14:31] am the resurrection in the life you and
[1:14:35] I must come to that before the dead
[1:14:37] because remember what brother Brown say
[1:14:38] he said now Christ comes up to the tomb
[1:14:40] of Lazarus if he would have said dead
[1:14:42] come forth he said everybody would have
[1:14:44] resurrected he said he said Lazarus come
[1:14:47] forth and Lazarus came forth but now you
[1:14:49] and I got a lot of dead friends in the
[1:14:51] ground seven whole church ages of people
[1:14:56] in the ground that you and I have got to
[1:14:58] come to a place to where you can say I
[1:15:02] am the resurrection all we swallowed the
[1:15:05] I am only struck what about I am the
[1:15:07] resurrection I am now as I am is you're
[1:15:09] not I am
[1:15:11] but when he connects with you can you
[1:15:13] separate them that's our problem what we
[1:15:16] do is is we try to start separating
[1:15:17] God's trying to pull us back in and
[1:15:21] we're trying to push ourselves by how we
[1:15:25] know humanly none of us are worthy but
[1:15:28] if you'll just listen to what God said
[1:15:29] God said we were worthy God told us if
[1:15:32] we had the Holy Ghost and we live by the
[1:15:34] word
[1:15:35] that he would do the same thing to us
[1:15:37] that he did to Jesus Christ Romans 8
[1:15:39] says we're heirs and joint heirs with
[1:15:41] Christ whatever he gets we get not in a
[1:15:45] lesser form but not in not in one person
[1:15:47] but in a mini membered body you and I
[1:15:49] are Jesus Christ made manifest on the
[1:15:51] earth let's borrow it here
[1:15:53] gentlemen I love the Lord we thank you
[1:15:55] for this day we pray that what we said
[1:15:57] Lord has been pleasing and the people
[1:15:59] will as we looked at in Revelations that
[1:16:03] John took the book and ate the book and
[1:16:06] it was sure sweet in his mouth but it
[1:16:09] was bitter in his stomach
[1:16:12] he had to go out and live what was in
[1:16:13] that book I pray father that you that
[1:16:16] the people here Lord today when I just

[1:16:34] journey there was all those different
