overnight thing it takes practice but you know if you have that town you have that desire you just give it to god and i've seen just young people they start out very uh timid and they're so concerned about when they get up there to play everything like i said you're not playing for an audience you're playing to god i said it's a it's an act of worship so if you do that to god i said watch him come on the scene and he'll bless you i've seen i've seen people just young people that just put their talent before god and god will use it and he'll bless you and so you just continue to pray over them and god will do great things and i told these girls i keep playing the piano you know sister astro get some help up here and sister joyce will get some help up here so and uh that's all right we don't

handle his word the wife has made herself ready yeah so let's take communion ready it's 12 o'clock the world's shooting fireworks and drinking their beer and and like sister nicky said thank god i wasn't the only one who did stuff like that she did well bless her heart but you know what that was before god got a hold of my life paul says in the lust of the flesh there's a lot of things we did amen but when god came along he cleaned us up he's the only one who can clean us up and we're going to take this communion because it's going to show what he did for us and that's no better thing to do than now at 1201 in 2022 i pray that you'll have a good year this year and i want to say it one more time this year whatever you got inside of you let it out right whether it be the devil you want him out but you want god to show out right of your soul amen whatever you got inside of you quit bottling it up let it out use your talent use your faith use your knowledge temperance patience godliness let's have a good year this year keep praying for brother and sister dale brother dale especially we miss him amen i know we i know we all do but you know what we got to keep going we got to keep moving on we got to keep doing what we're doing he's laid a good foundation and he's built on it and we're just going to continue to build on that amen so let's read the scripture in first corinthians 11 verse 23 says for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood that had to be the death of a testator for a new testament to come into force amen he knew he was getting ready to die and the new testament was coming in the cup is this cup is the new testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this dr bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body what is the lord's body me and you amen for this cause many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened to the lord that we should not be condemned with the world thank god amen we're in the world but not of the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat terry one for another and if any man hunger lady meet at home that you come not together in the condemnation and rest well i'll set an order when i come let's have a moment of silence the prophet of god said pray for your pastor and let's pray for our brothers lord as we come into a new year let this not be a ritual but let this be a revelation as our brother said as we eat this bread and drink this cup lord you made us worthy and you told us to do this in remembrance of you lord so what greater thing can we do the first thing of the year is to remember you and how you suffered and died and how you shed your blood you took stripes on your back and you took a crown of thorns on your head just for me father we pray that the world will see you but we know that you said the world will not see you anymore only the bride the ones that you dwell in father i pray that you'd be with us now and bless us in jesus name amen the bible said he took bread and blessed it dear heavenly father this bread lord was made with holy hands it was made without anything lord to make it rise lord it's unleavened now we pray lord as we partake of this lord that it'll be a blessing to each and every one of us in jesus name amen i know a lot of us we take communion different ways and we've done this for so many years and some some use one cup but i don't think it matters brown used many cups and that's not an excuse but or anything but i just think one cup's fine i mean fine and also mini cups is fine so just whatever you think you know your church is sovereign your church is sovereign amen but if you'll do it to the lord i promise you you'll get something out of it you do it unto yourself you won't but you do it unto the lord you'll get something out of it amen yeah we take this bread i was talking to a judge over in in bates county good friend of mine tim harper and he asked me he said you said you were going to take communion i said yeah we're going to take him in he said what do y'all use for bread and you know for the i said we need real wine he just kind of looked at me strange he said you use real wine i said yeah i think that's what they drank in the upper room it wasn't a substitute it wasn't grape juice but i remember when dad used to do it in the in the uh in the uh baptist church they'd take welch's grape juice and i told brother tim i said and we even they even cut it for the older one so it wouldn't burn their throat so he just kind of giggled a little bit and also we uh i remember him taking the bread and brother chris they would buy it in a box it's a little bitty wafer about like this and they freeze it and hold it over now tonight when we're finished taking this bread i'm gonna burn it beyond edible because we don't want to hold it over see that's a revelation we've got and this is a revelation that we take and he he about had a fit he said you mean y'all drink wine i said yes we drink wine he said now he said now when i asked my pastor about drinking wine and he said that we've got some alcoholics in our in our congregation and and we don't think it would be good to do that and and i looked at tim and he looked to me and he's just a nominal christian guy real good guy and i said well i said i look at it like this if you're shouting and running the aisles and you fall and break your leg that's you that ain't gone so if you want if you believe that this wine is what you're supposed to take it ain't going to bother your alcohol it's anonymous right right god it's not that way god instituted us to take it like this and this is the way we're going to take it right heavenly father lord this wine was also made and prepared with holy hands and father i pray now as we partake of this lord it will remember you lord of what you did for us and this wine lord it won't sour it gets better with age and lord that's your word father just gets better and better with age we pray now that you'd be with us as we partake of this communion and be with us in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen good morning i'll walk by the river i'll rest near the ever green tree i'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes i'm despised and rejected feel that way sometimes and i question father how long then i take one more look at mount calvary and it gives me the strength to go on good morning brother brown said it between six and nine in the morning we'll be out of here all rest neath the evergreen tree i'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes i'm despised and rejected just like he was and i questioned oh father how long did i take one more look at mount calvary and it gives me the strength to go on wonderful time yes we've made it one more year who in the world would have thought it joyce and i were when we were growing up coming in in this church and we we well she's older than i am but we thought we would not ever graduate from high school much less now we both have grandchildren but god's left left us here for a purpose there was a lot of immaturity back then that needed to be done away with there was a lot of babies that needed to grow up and now we're here i just really believe that we're here i believe we've come to a time i'm gonna be like what brother chris said you know jesus looked at the disciples and he said you gonna go to an old peter bless his heart i like what one brother said said peter had a foot shaped mouth because he always kept his shoeing but he raised up and he said lord where else would we go i mean come on folks what else would you do could how could you go back to the way you were before it'd be a deception past deception you love the lord let's take communion thank you lord thank you father as they're taking up the the cups i want to again thank you for coming and forever for brother dale thank you for being a part of this church thank you for loving the lord because i see it in you we're going to grow together all right there's going to be trials and tribulations you know some may some soldiers may fall but what do you do you pick up and continue fighting that's right you don't stop you don't turn around and go backwards there's nothing to cover you if you turn around and go backwards everything's forward the shield everything you need is right here it's not something on your back it's right here in front of you just keep pushing listen push away press paul said press to
