========================================

amen appreciate the Lord and giving us another another day of life amen we don't deserve it but he he gave it to us amen and we're going to make this day the best that we can right give him praise amen well let's just bow our heads one more time before we continue our heavenly father we just come before you once again Lord and just thanking you father for the opportunity that we have to serve you and to come and worship you in spirit and in truth Lord to Feast upon your word Lord we pray that you would have your way here this morning and give us something Lord God that we can take with us and immediately apply in our lives Lord Jesus and uh you just uh use my lips this morning and Lord you just continue to be with everyone father God that is traveling and and sick father you know every need father that was mentioned here and we just ask these things now in Jesus Christ's name amen amen praise the Lord Lord Jesus we're going to go to uh uh I'm not going to show any scriptures on the on the screen so um just turn there or they can put him up on the screen but uh it's in 1 Corinthians chapter 4 and um verse verse four it says this for I Know Nothing by myself yet am I not hereby Justified but he that judgeth me is the Lord therefore and this is the the verse I wanted concentrate on therefore judge nothing before the time judge nothing before the time until the Lord come who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the councils of the hearts and then shall every man have Praise of God and so I wanted to concentrate on that amen now you know brother brandom he talked about he T he preached a message called presuming anden and and and and he he said that the uh he looked at at the at the uh the definition of the word presuming and it it was to venture without Authority and um but sometimes we get confused as to when to use the word presuming and the word assuming because they're very very very much alike and uh so I I brought up Webster's Dictionary nowadays and and and and this is what what what both of those mean amen it says that although presume and assume both mean to take something as true presume implies more confidence or evidence backed reasoning right when you presume something um you know I'm presuming that that that that my car is out there you know in the parking lot because I drove it here this morning that was that's the evidence that I have but now assuming doesn't doesn't have any evidence backing it up you just assume I assume that brother Don's Car is out there but I didn't see him pull pull up the car but I'm assuming I'm just thinking that and and we do that a lot we just venture to think things about others about about situations and you have no Speck of proof whatsoever right that's what assuming is now presuming is the proof is there but you don't know that yet it's true or not so there's a little bit there's another little layer of of of Truth there with presuming whereas assuming you don't have any layer of Truth yet you're stating something as a fact and that's Dangerous Ground as for us as Christians to walk upon it's very easy for us to judge Paul clearly tells us here don't judge things before the time let the Lord take care of those things amen because then what will we be doing when we have no proof or backing it up we are just assuming we are just thinking that that's how things are when in reality you have nothing to back what you're what you're saying you see so it continues to say here assume and presume both mean to take something for granted or to take something as true the difference between the words lies in the degree of confidence held by the speaker or writer if he or she is making an informed guess based on reasonable evidence presume is the word to use if a guess is made based on little or no evidence assume is usually used so that is uh that is what presume and and assume mean now I I I was looking through the scripture and and I I I came to the um the story of of of the priest Eli and and Hannah and uh and when when Hannah if you remember Hannah went she was travailing before God because she couldn't have children and she asked the L she was she went down to the uh near the temple and she was there praying that the Lord give her a child and that she was going to dedicate it to it well Eli the priest a holy man a man that was dedicated to God here he is looking at Hannah thinking that she had had too much wine because she was there crying she was there travailing before God maybe she was shaking maybe she was she was really praying to the Lord but in his judgment he thought that she was drunk not knowing that she was actually doing a spiritual thing and asking God to do something for her because she was in need how many times you know we we we we we do that so many so many times you know you know we we see the the actions of individuals and and we look at them and we immediately judge those actions with something that we you know from previous experiences that we've had and we can't do that to people uh sister Rebecca brother Eric's wife that was here from Honduras they were on the airplane coming here to the states and she wanted to sit there with her husband on the same seat because so he could help her with the baby so uh their their seats were separate and so there was a lady there that she had asked is it possible that that that my husband could sit here and you can just take his seat Well she didn't want to give up her seat and she and and so um they um the lady started talking to her husband cuz her husband was sitting next to her and she she kept telling him I'm not giving up my seat I paid for this seat and all you know and she was just being real nasty about it but she was thinking that Rebecca couldn't speak English so she's there talking to her husband the whole time about her the lady comes through and asks you know what does she want does she want coffee does she want tea the lady that works in the airplane the steward is Lady and Rebecca just started talking to her in plain English I want uh coffee or you know this and and the husband he said she said that she heard uh the husband tell her [Laughter] English so you can't assume assume makes you look dumb when you assume things that you have no no evidence what you know uh there was a pastor as at the Wesleyan Church he he he was an American man and he spoke very well uh Spanish and he had a little Spanish congregation he was trying to help there in in Greenville South Carolina and that's we were going there with him for a while before we came to the message and uh he said he was at a Waffle House one time and there was some Latinos in there you know talking about him you know I don't know what they were saying and he just turned to them and and started talking to him in Spanish and [Laughter] he so you you can't really especially nowadays you know you can't assume who speaks Spanish and who doesn't or who speaks English and who doesn't because uh sometimes the ones that look like they speak Spanish they don't and then sometimes the ones that speak that we think they speak English and they don't so so it's it's it's it's a very very tricky ground for you to assume or presume you see that you know uh because because what happens is that sometimes assumptions um makes us think like we we we we we know the answer to questions and in reality we don't we don't have the answers to questions you see it makes you look foolish sometimes when you are judging things before the time so here was here was uh Eli he was judging Hannah when Hannah was actually doing a good deed and he was presuming now see it happens to E any one of us it can happen to to to to no matter what your position is Eli was a was a priest before God but maybe you know I don't know see he his two sons he had two sons who who were were not living right and they were probably getting drunk and stuff like that too and so he's he's seeing that so much that he thinks that that's what Hannah was there to do as well that she was there drunk but in reality she was not so so sometimes assumptions um assumptions they ask the right questions but we jump too quickly to conclusions you see and and and and and you can see that in the case of of job when job he he the Lord allowed Satan to touch his life he said you can touch your his life but don't don't kill him you know that's that was only for the Lord and so here he here is here are job's friends and they're all around here and they're assuming without any evidence that job had committed sin and therefore he was in the condition that he's in but the Bible says that job was a righteous man and in so much that he would actually sacrifice and he would give offerings to the Lord even for his own children just in case if they have sinned so he was concerned about himself and about his family and the the Lord blessed them the Lord blessed them greatly but here are these Men supposed to be his friends and they're assuming without any evidence that he had sinned and they were trying to give him the the the solution to the problem when in reality that wasn't what job was needing we know that later on you know God shows him the reality of of of of how things are so we can't we can't assume we can't jump too quickly Amen to to uh to to to assumptions amen amen um and and and and we know that also that our our natural assumptions uh our assumptions our own human assumptions they they don't they usually don't align with with God's thinking with the way God thinks and the way God sees individuals all right you know we sometimes we see our individuals and we and we think you know what there's no hope for that person but not in God's eyes God doesn't see that God can change the hearts whereas you can't change hearts and sometimes we see our children in that way and we think you know what my my my son my daughter you know I I don't know that they're just so far gone but God doesn't see it that way there's nothing too there's nothing impossible for God is there anything too hard for the Lord and see and so you're assuming you're you're you're seeing uh uh you're it's your own personal experience for example Sarah you know she was listening to to to the angel telling Abraham you're going your your wife's going to have a do a son she's going to give birth and she was old as she was listening in the tent behind them and in her mind and in her own human uh uh ways she's a assuming wait a second if I put I put two plus two together I get four I'm old I can't have children anymore how is that going to happen and because of her assumption she was getting ready to get in trouble the angel Lord you know was God could have struck her right there but because of Abraham and man stepped in for her and also because he was part of her and she was part of him amen God could not hurt her and but God heard it God heard that she was assuming that God could not do what he said that he was going to do right there at the moment so we can't assume amen that that what we have to take everything that God says in his word as is truth amen amen and that and we even if we don't see the results or the happening right there and then God said it and as brother Billy Paul used to say God said it I believe it that settles it right amen you just it it's better to live life that way instead of having a negativity about about everything well God said it but you see she acts this way she does this he does this she you see is a better way God can change the heart look he he changed the heart of of King Nebuchadnezzar one day he he changes the hearts of of of of of of the most vile man in the and and he changed your heart amen why couldn't he do that with your with your daughter or with your son or with your family member or that that person that you're praying for God is more than able so we can't assume that God's word can't apply to him or her and because God's word is true praise the Lord Jesus amen um let's see here now also fear can cause us to assume uh the worst about people and and also their intentions when we have fear and we're not thinking right we we we we we we sometimes we think that uh someone's out to get [Laughter] me uh somebody's somebody's out there uh uh just ready to pounce on me whenever but see fear causes you to act that way that's why the Bible says do not fear it tells us fear fear is a Tormentor so so fear causes us to assume things causes us to judge things and then there's there's nothing there for us to there's no evidence of it you see um you know it's just like just like a little a little kid in in a bedroom who's scared you know at night and he just really really thinks that there's something in that closet I mean he really really believes it and and and and and and in the and he believes it so much that it actually becomes real he his imagination brings up this thing and he starts screaming in the middle of the night Mommy I saw I saw something I I really saw I saw a hand come out of that closet but it was all in his head now you just be you as parents you know you just be very tender about those things because to them that's real so you have to handle those things you know with a with a soft glove you know and just like boy just go to bed pow go to bed they're going to remember that the rest of their life Mommy and Daddy they don't believe what I you know nothing I tell them you see so handle that with with some softness but some truth at the same time you see praise God so it it so fear it could it could makes a it makes makes us suspicious and paranoid about people you know sometimes we think oh they're they're out they're out to get me they're out they're they're scheming something and it makes you paranoid about people and you can't trust people even people at church you can't even trust them because you're paranoid and you're assuming that people are out to get you and that's wrong that's not how a Christian should live yeah that's fear and fear fear causes torment torment your mind amen assumptions they're um and we know that assumptions they're they're they're made quickly and we talked about the human Viewpoint of of assumption and wrong assumptions they also they lead they lead us to arguments and and and and it threatens our relationships with individuals when you are assuming amen the the wrong side of things when you have no evidence remember assumption is you thinking that something is true when you don't have the evidence and then presum presuming there's a layer of evidence there but you still don't know yet if it's true or not so either one is still you can't do either one now brother Brandon when he preached that message presuming he was he was talking about how individuals they think because they've had an experience in the church or they shook the the pastor's hand or they they they set a couple of Hell marries or or they did something good in the church that that immediately takes them to Heaven that's you presuming there's evidence there that you did something good sure everybody saw it but that does not put you in the kingdom of God you can only come into the kingdom of God is by a new birth a new birth amen is what brings you that now that is sure when you have a new birth there is no assumption then about am I going to heaven or after this life or not amen you experience something real that changes you from the inside out amen amen so assumptions and and presumptions amen they they are danger they are dangerous and like I just said you know when uh they they can damage the relationship with people you know sometimes we think that we're so right that that and we just assume everybody else is wrong and we and we act and we live our life like that and what you are doing is you're making you're making people to not even want to be around you you you you you you you actively judge people before you know anything about that person or about that person's situation I certainly don't want to be around around people that are constantly judging judge judging me you know i' rather live my life uh um you know expecting the best out of people right right and then let things be sorted out in their time right in time things will will happen in time the smoke will clear and then you will see the the the clear picture but it it while while you don't know the evidence or while you have no no no nothing that you can fully grasp amen just give people the benefit of the doubt amen right I I would think that that Jesus that's what he would have done right now there's clear sin there's clear there's there's you know you see out here someone you know a brother or a sister you know smacking somebody out here in the parking lot you know that's that that's clear you know that's clear well I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt that they were not smacking that sister in the face I'm just going to no you do something about that all right you stop the situation you're you're you're you know for the benefit of both of them but when there's things you know that you're just not not sure about amen you just lay them before the Lord am he's the one that knows all things he knows all Hearts he knows all situations and he knows every detail of every situation all right so is that's the best thing to do amen praise the Lord and then um sometimes assumptions that causes us to to give upon people man and this goes back to what I was saying earlier you know sometimes we we we we see people sometimes in the world so far gone and you think my there's just no hope for that person but God has done some miraculous things in in in this world that you don't even know about we don't know about you know you read about the testimonies of of individuals who were um satanists and murderers and and and all kinds of people vile people that you would not think that God could save and change their lives and they've become to be some of the the best Christians in the world yes it wasn't they that did that it was God that changed the hearts so don't look at people and and think you know there's no hope for for him or her amen There's Hope for everybody amen oh and as I always said you know as you're if while you're still sucking air There's Hope for you don't assume that about yourself either don't assume I've just gone too far I've I've send my my my way my day of Grace you can't do that you're still here you're still alive if God didn't want you to be here you just wouldn't be here God's the one who takes life and he's the one that gives life right so you're here for a purpose amen praise God and then sometimes an assumption uh it causes misunder understandings and of course you know we just read that about it damages it damages people you see it hurts it hurts relationships right you can't trust the person people anymore when they're assuming about your life in certain ways when in reality that's not it right we have we've all had experiences you know where people assume the wrong thing about us and then you try to just you try to show them the reality or the truth about it but it's so in their mind that that's how it is you know that that you just can't change that and then you just have to move on and let the Lord do the work amen sometimes people live their life that they always have to prove they they they that they're right you know you they always have to prove it some way or another and I'd rather just just move on let you know just just let the Lord sort that out you know as as Paul said and we were just reading here did he say he said therefore judge nothing before the time until the Lord come in other words let the Lord sort it out who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the heart and then shall every man have Praise of God right you know sometimes we worry about you know uh the hidden things of what goes on in the world and you know I get caught up with things things like that too I I like looking at the news behind the news and you know what goes on behind the scenes you know but sometimes you get caught up in those rabbit holes so much and then and then you you come to a point where like well who knows but God knows right God knows because God created those individuals and eventually the smoke will clear and the dust will settle and those truths will come out there's nothing that's going to there's nothing that's going to be hidden amen so IID like to finish with this in Proverbs 10:28 it says the hopes of The Godly result in happiness but the expectations of the wicked they come to nothing right so the hopes all right the hopes of The Godly and I'm I'm I'm assuming that your hopes the hopes of The Godly are good hopes right and that they're going to uh they they allow us to have happier lives and more uh TR tranquil lives instead of prejudging people before the time right in 1 Corinthians 4:5 it says so don't make judgments and we just read about that but this is a different a different uh um um I'm sorry another another uh Bible translation so don't make judgments about anyone ahead of time before the Lord returns for he will bring our darkest secrets to light and we will reveal our private motives then God will give to each one Whatever praise is due Amen Let the dust settle let things clear up let things let things uh uh uh uh just settle down and before we start making assumptions before we start prejudging people because the Bible clearly tells us and Jesus said this he said let's leave let's live peaceably with people I'm just paraphrasing do everything that you can in your possible way to have peace with people right and that is one of the ways to do that do not assume that just because a person looks a certain way or just because a person said something or you have no evidence of that therefore you should not prejudge or assume when you you don't even live with the person in their house you don't know what's going on you don't know what happens in their head especially when they hardly don't say anything or they don't talk much you don't know and and sometimes as us as ministers you know that's kind of hard you know when we're sitting here preaching and we're looking at people and we're prejudging already what people are thinking about our sermon we think that people are not listening or that they're mad when they're looking at us when in reality I'm having to understand that more and more is that all they're doing is just paying attention but because they're not saying amen or because you know they're not we're already assuming that they don't like what we're saying and that that that makes us look foolish as a minister so we don't want to do that I have to put myself in there because uh that's we do that so much all right we are we We Are Who We Are we we're the church that we are we're not we don't jump and Shout like you know at other churches but that doesn't mean that the word is not getting to youen we don't we it's getting to you and I'm coming to realize that more and more and more right somebody falls asleep oh well maybe that part wasn't for them right or maybe they're just very they're just older and they just need to rest they're very tired brother colie but anyways God bless you all we love y'all amen praise the Lord
