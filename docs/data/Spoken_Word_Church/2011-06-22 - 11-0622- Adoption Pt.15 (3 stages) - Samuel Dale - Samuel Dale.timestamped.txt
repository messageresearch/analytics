[20:04] for you like returning your scriptures
[20:06] turn back where we've been reading in
[20:08] Ephesians
[20:10] one and then we'll go to Romans 8
[20:14] Ephesians 1. now remember that uh the
[20:20] Lord willing on the
[20:22] not this coming weekend now but the next
[20:24] one which will be the second the third
[20:26] of July will be our 40th anniversary
[20:29] here in the church which will actually
[20:31] be on the fourth which is on Monday but
[20:33] we can't handle it that away so we'll
[20:35] just do it with with the third and and
[20:38] it'll be all right I remember that
[20:39] remember brother Reed will be brother
[20:41] Keith Reed will be here preaching for us
[20:44] um for the weekend so just keep those in
[20:46] mind
[20:48] looking forward to a good time in the
[20:50] Lord and a good time to celebrate 40
[20:52] years you know and maybe we've made our
[20:56] journey into around the mountain
[20:59] you know round and around for 40 years
[21:02] they went around and around and then
[21:04] they finally got started the other way
[21:06] so maybe we've made our journey round
[21:08] and around and we can get on where to do
[21:11] it but just remember all of these that
[21:12] are sick among us and I just pray to the
[21:15] Lord to bless Sister Barbara there got
[21:17] shingles and brother dick was taking
[21:19] some medication and it really messed him
[21:21] up so just remember all of these the
[21:24] sick ones Among Us Brother Gary and uh
[21:26] he's doing great he's able to be up and
[21:28] around he was maybe don't come to church
[21:30] tonight when I talked to him yesterday
[21:32] but I guess he didn't feel like it but
[21:35] they'll probably all be watching on the
[21:37] internet so we say hi to each one of you
[21:40] out there on the on the internet waves
[21:42] and things uh that the Lord will bless
[21:45] all right Ephesians 1 and Romans
[21:48] eight
[21:49] now we won't be having a we won't be
[21:52] having our Bible study on the first
[21:54] Saturday
[21:57] so we would just kind of probably I
[21:58] guess count that as the Bible study for
[22:01] this time or do you want to move over
[22:02] and have the bible study on the second
[22:04] Saturday
[22:07] what about it
[22:08] anybody you want it to Second Saturday
[22:10] because we won't be having the first
[22:12] Saturday because we'll be here we're
[22:14] really key free okay all right so
[22:16] everybody wanted to be all right with
[22:17] everybody amen for the yes
[22:26] okay all right yeah that'd be fine so
[22:29] it'll be on the second Saturday of July
[22:31] this this time okay uh six o'clock amen
[22:34] father we thank you for your loving your
[22:36] grace unto us and we thank you for all
[22:38] things and we ask you to just help us
[22:40] and guide us and lead us by that
[22:42] understanding that we may Lord just walk
[22:46] in the light of Your Love forgive our
[22:48] sins because we want to stand complete
[22:50] in you and we ask you to bless each one
[22:53] remember the sick among us there's many
[22:55] many sicknesses and things and you said
[22:58] in your word that you sent your word and
[22:59] healed it healed us and delivered us
[23:01] from destruction so father we ask you to
[23:04] just make it manifest and those are out
[23:06] there watching tonight because of not
[23:08] being able to come because of the
[23:09] sickness we ask you to bless them and
[23:12] just be with each one the same as it
[23:14] would be here we love you and we thank
[23:16] you and just have your way keep us
[23:18] because that's what we desire for you to
[23:20] do in Jesus name amen
[23:26] been in the seasons for a while but we
[23:29] haven't worn it out yet so
[23:31] Ephesians 1 verse 3 blessed be the God
[23:35] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[23:36] hath blessed us with all spiritual
[23:38] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[23:41] according as he has chosen Us in him
[23:43] before the foundation of the world that
[23:46] we should be holding Without Blame
[23:47] before him in love having predestinated
[23:50] us unto the adoption of children by
[23:52] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[23:54] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[23:57] of the glory of his grace wherein he
[23:59] hath made us accepted in the Beloved now
[24:03] let's go over to Romans where we want to
[24:05] read Romans
[24:07] hey but we want to read verse 5 through
[24:09] 11.
[24:12] that's Romans 8 verse 5 through 11. for
[24:15] they utter after the flesh do mind the
[24:17] things of the flesh but they interact
[24:19] the spirit the things of the spirit to
[24:21] be carnally minded is death but to be
[24:23] spiritually minded his life and peace
[24:25] because the carnal mind is enmity
[24:28] against God for it is not subject to the
[24:30] law of God neither indeed can be so then
[24:33] they that are in the flesh cannot please
[24:35] God but you are not in the flesh but in
[24:38] the spirit now watch he's asking the
[24:40] question the it's not saying everybody
[24:43] another way it see it's putting a point
[24:46] is dark but ye are not in the flesh but
[24:49] in the spirit if so be that the spirit
[24:51] of God dwell in you see now there's the
[24:53] condition now if any man have not the
[24:56] spirit of Christ he is none of his and
[24:59] if Christ be in you the body is dead
[25:02] because of sin
[25:03] but the spirit is life because of
[25:06] righteousness but if the spirit of him
[25:08] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[25:11] in you he that raised up Christ from the
[25:14] dead shall also Quicken your mortal
[25:17] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[25:19] you and they deceive that the Lord at
[25:22] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[25:25] now
[25:27] I know I have a whole lot of
[25:29] of popes up here tonight
[25:31] and uh we may read some of it may not
[25:35] but if not you will have it to worry
[25:37] that you can can uh
[25:39] at least see what we're trying to cover
[25:42] but we've got over into the message
[25:46] and I want to make sure and cover this
[25:49] tonight that we will know what you know
[25:52] is what I'm trying to get to of the
[25:57] adoption and the things and uh it's
[26:01] coming down to a place until I believe
[26:03] that we are in the last days
[26:06] and the finishing up now how long
[26:08] that'll be that's no problem with any of
[26:10] us I was talking to brother Carol the
[26:12] other day and I think he's 80 something
[26:14] about 83 or something like that and he
[26:16] said that somebody said well you know
[26:19] the Rapture I believe he's coming pretty
[26:20] quick he said well at my age it ain't
[26:22] going to make much difference he said
[26:24] because I'm going one way pretty quick
[26:26] you know the age we're getting so uh you
[26:30] know that's a good point but I want to
[26:32] be here for the change and and all like
[26:34] that I wanted to see it but
[26:37] now I was trying to bring a point to you
[26:40] and I want to make sure you understand
[26:42] it
[26:43] see things don't happen just by chance
[26:47] you know God's everything is
[26:49] pre-programmed and you remember how that
[26:52] back up a few months ago that we were
[26:55] talking about how that the uh it is not
[26:58] the person that comes predestinated
[27:00] eternally from God but the word our seed
[27:03] and we talked about a word or d word or
[27:08] seed for each age
[27:10] all right so there is a word for each
[27:13] age and time all right so then we have
[27:16] the finishing up of all of the word in
[27:20] this day and that is the word for our
[27:23] day and our time we have the greatest of
[27:25] all uh things looking forward to and
[27:28] appreciating what God has already given
[27:31] us but I was trying to to bring a point
[27:35] to you and I want to keep that point in
[27:37] mind tonight that
[27:39] hey
[27:43] in each age
[27:45] I was looking at these the other day you
[27:47] know in the studying on it and in each
[27:50] age has been a Divine Healing campaign
[27:53] to follow
[27:55] the message of that age all right now
[27:59] I'm quoting wrote a random each age had
[28:01] a healing campaign to go out
[28:04] all right but this age was very special
[28:10] because you know when Azusa Street took
[28:14] place there in 1906
[28:16] . see there was things following that
[28:18] which was the movement of God and all
[28:20] like that and and things were taking
[28:22] place but then as it began to die down a
[28:26] little bit then you see that that you
[28:30] know a a healing campaign started around
[28:33] the world
[28:35] this one would be a worldwide thing not
[28:38] just you know a partial it would be a
[28:42] great thing happening and you know
[28:44] people don't realize what took place
[28:46] back there when the prophet of God began
[28:49] to to bring forth in the the Divine
[28:52] Healing Ministry right you know and he
[28:56] began to to speak on those things and I
[28:59] wanted I made some statements about it
[29:01] and I want you to to fully understand
[29:03] what I'm getting at it and uh see then
[29:08] in this day
[29:10] this time
[29:12] they were to be a healing campaign let's
[29:14] go back and read from Malachi
[29:17] and just just read Malachi 4 and you'll
[29:21] see what it's saying because see we look
[29:24] at Malachi 4 A lot of times it's only
[29:27] the message that would be coming forth
[29:30] you know and then being careful we'll
[29:33] drop over to to the last days of brother
[29:35] Reynolds Ministry and and start off from
[29:38] there but I want you to see something
[29:41] from this
[29:42] and to read Malachi 4 I want us to
[29:45] follow one point see that there was a it
[29:48] was a promise in God's word all right
[29:51] now each age they get the point each age
[29:54] had a word or seed and it was promised
[29:57] for that age all right now so then in in
[30:00] the age coming that we're in see if
[30:03] there was a healing campaign started all
[30:06] right to fulfill the scriptures right
[30:08] all right and that will go all the way
[30:12] yeah me
[30:13] that will go all the way to the
[30:16] Millennium right with the the scriptures
[30:18] that we're going to read and and that
[30:21] way we can follow that point but the
[30:23] main thing I want you to see is that
[30:26] this healing campaign it had more to do
[30:29] with it than just Divine Healing right
[30:31] amen
[30:32] see it it meant a whole lot more than
[30:36] just the Divine Healing but the Divine
[30:38] Healing is like brother Bosphorus would
[30:40] always say said brother Branham said the
[30:43] the healing and the thing said that's
[30:45] just bait on the hook
[30:47] and that's why I believe that brother
[30:49] Branham started out in his early
[30:51] Ministry and you remember that he used
[30:54] to he would house somebody to preach for
[30:56] him I sure did all right and then he
[30:59] would just come out and pray for the
[31:00] sick
[31:01] what well then he stopped that and he
[31:04] started preaching the message and then
[31:07] he would
[31:08] you know the the prayer for the sick
[31:10] would take place which put a double
[31:12] burden on him but it was to you know I
[31:16] wouldn't want to follow a trinitarian
[31:18] out to to preach on Divine Healing you
[31:21] know because he would be lining me up in
[31:23] the wrong direction you know and I
[31:26] wouldn't want that understanding so I
[31:28] just believe that brother random just
[31:30] saw it you know because you'll see in a
[31:32] minute then he knew that they would be a
[31:34] message come I mean
[31:36] amen he knew the Divine Healing if if
[31:39] there was to be a Divine Healing
[31:40] campaign that was only to get the
[31:43] attention
[31:44] for the people now I'm show you a lot of
[31:46] quotes on that but it shouldn't be
[31:48] needed you were to understand that that
[31:51] healing campaigned it you know it was
[31:54] there and even to the writers that
[31:56] credit brother random and Oral Roberts
[31:58] as to be the the major ones or the
[32:00] Divine Healing campaign all right but
[32:03] you better remember one thing or Roberts
[32:05] came out from Brother Brown so you
[32:07] remember he was the first one going
[32:09] forth you know with the the healing
[32:12] campaign in this we read the things in a
[32:14] minute watch the little key things that
[32:16] he'll say sometimes as to uh expressing
[32:20] a thought but let's let's read Malachi
[32:22] here as we're at it we'll go over about
[32:24] to
[32:26] now let's just read start off verse one
[32:28] Malachi 4 for behold the day cometh that
[32:31] shall burn as an oven and all the proud
[32:34] yeah and all that do wickedly shall be
[32:35] stubble and and the day that cometh
[32:38] shall burn them up saith the Lord of
[32:40] hosts that it shall leave them neither
[32:42] root in a branch now you remember
[32:43] brother said I said uh that's gonna that
[32:47] proves that there is no eternal hell
[32:49] because it's going to burn up and all
[32:51] right but now start in verse two but
[32:54] unto you yeah I put a big old circle
[32:56] around mine that's me all right but unto
[33:00] you that fear my name
[33:03] shall the son of righteousness rise with
[33:06] healing in his wings and ye shall go
[33:10] forth and grow up as caves of the stall
[33:14] all right now so then
[33:18] the promise is to you
[33:22] all right the son of righteousness will
[33:24] rise with healings in his wings now I've
[33:27] got the quotes in here we come on down
[33:28] in a little bit that that goes all the
[33:30] way to the Millennium right
[33:32] so this didn't just start as I said run
[33:35] around didn't come out just preaching
[33:37] and see he knew something was going to
[33:40] take place
[33:41] all right and he knew that there would
[33:44] be a message followed after this healing
[33:47] campaign all right see because it would
[33:50] be the son of righteousness right
[33:53] arising with healings Indian wings and
[33:55] if you'll run into your computer just
[33:57] run in Son of righteousness you'll find
[33:59] it as very little relating to actually
[34:02] just stopping on the Divine Healing
[34:04] point right it will carry all the way
[34:07] into the millennial Reign this son of
[34:10] righteousness will rise but it started
[34:13] there right that's my point I want you
[34:15] to see
[34:17] that something started back there right
[34:19] in the Divine Healing
[34:22] that has more to do with us than just a
[34:24] healing campaign
[34:26] they had those after following each
[34:30] message that would go forth they would
[34:32] be healings and signs and wonders but in
[34:35] this one it had a very special meaning
[34:37] because it was going to be the last
[34:40] tweeting
[34:44] unto the coming of the Lord of a healing
[34:48] campaign right all right and that's why
[34:50] things are not going now like everybody
[34:53] thinks we're to be doing this be doing
[34:55] that if we've got this you know we don't
[34:57] have nothing because we could produce
[34:58] this that the other we're not in the
[35:00] days of the healing campaign but it
[35:03] didn't stop with brother Branham when he
[35:05] went to the Grave amen we can still
[35:07] believe and we still see signs and
[35:09] wonders and we thank God for those
[35:10] things but not a worldwide sweeping
[35:13] that's right
[35:14] they're having more more uh uh healing
[35:18] campaigns out in the the denominational
[35:21] world right today that is taking place
[35:23] among the people of the message as far
[35:25] as a campaign for healing you don't hear
[35:27] of anybody announced we're going to have
[35:28] a healing campaign right they're going
[35:31] to have a preaching campaign they're
[35:33] going to have Holy Ghost Campaign or
[35:35] something they don't mention having a
[35:37] Divine human see because that was where
[35:39] when it was come there with the prophet
[35:42] it would not stop until the millenniums
[35:45] all right so now now get that point see
[35:48] that the son of righteousness will rise
[35:50] with healings in his wings right
[35:53] all right but it don't stop with just
[35:55] healings in his wings as a healing
[35:57] campaign
[35:59] you see it goes on it says and
[36:02] conjunction
[36:04] and ye see
[36:06] shall go forth and grow up as caves of
[36:10] the stall you the reason that's there
[36:12] the prophet is illustrating what you
[36:15] feed calves or the Stalls stored up food
[36:17] right right
[36:19] you know you don't they don't eat grass
[36:22] out in the pasture they're staying a
[36:25] stall you're feeding as we call it in
[36:27] the southern form of of doing you call
[36:29] it feeding it out
[36:31] in other words it's been out eating up
[36:33] on things and then you put it in there
[36:35] and you begin to feed it feed to to uh
[36:39] cleanse the body from a lot of the
[36:42] toxics of the the grass the things that
[36:45] was there and you're you're fattening
[36:47] them up and getting everything ready to
[36:49] tenderize the meat you know right in
[36:51] case anybody didn't know what all that's
[36:53] about about see you know but see it's
[36:57] not just a healing campaign right this
[37:00] healing campaign has to flow over into
[37:05] so you read Malachi 4 you know you you
[37:07] got the son of righteousness rise wasn't
[37:09] healing in his wings oh see so that
[37:12] doesn't stop now it'll go all the way to
[37:14] the Millennium right
[37:16] right oh they're showing a ratchetness
[37:17] right when healing in his wings because
[37:19] see over to that point
[37:21] things are going to be taking place all
[37:24] right now but then see there's to be a
[37:27] message followed
[37:30] because it says ye shall grow up all
[37:32] right now so get those two together
[37:34] tonight or what what we're talking about
[37:36] amen but we're talking about laying a
[37:39] foundation or God preparing uh a way
[37:43] that he could bring it into a uh uh
[37:47] bring in the word
[37:50] okay you said what they can do is sweep
[37:52] down and just do this well that's that's
[37:54] true and that's the way he pretty well
[37:56] done it in the ages but in this age he
[37:58] sends forth a healing campaign
[38:03] and the whole world begins to go through
[38:05] a point in the 40s and 50s and on up
[38:09] into the to the early 60s
[38:12] of people like Oral Roberts and all of
[38:14] them going forth with with great things
[38:16] happening not just brother Branham it
[38:19] was a healing campaign to strike the
[38:22] world but run around and said I knew
[38:26] all alone that there was a message to
[38:29] come
[38:30] amen
[38:32] if they're going to be Divine Healing
[38:34] there's got to be a message following
[38:36] that amen and it's not just the message
[38:38] of Divine Healing
[38:41] you get it it's not just a message that
[38:43] we're healing we're healing healing
[38:45] healing having a healing campaign all
[38:47] right that's wonderful thank God
[38:51] but there would be a message
[38:54] so Malachi shows you that now all right
[38:57] so go in your notes now and you'll have
[39:00] to scramble through to find it because
[39:01] it's actually the last page
[39:04] 29 30 31 and I just added these to it
[39:09] and left them on there where I could
[39:10] pull them out real quick so let's look
[39:13] and see what your Prophet had to say
[39:15] look at number 29 on your note star
[39:17] where it says God's provided way preach
[39:19] the 1959 415 and the a all right
[39:24] he's talking about uh invitations Givens
[39:26] and different things taking place and
[39:28] and all and he's talking about the lame
[39:31] she'll walk and the certain things you
[39:32] know the signs and the Wonders now look
[39:35] the last calling
[39:38] and the last invitation
[39:40] was a great time to sweep across the
[39:43] country
[39:44] in Divine Healing
[39:48] that was the last and we're winding up
[39:52] the end of that
[39:54] just pulling in the Loose Ends right now
[39:58] so how close is the coming of the Lord
[40:02] then he goes on to covering telling you
[40:04] how the Divine Healing is only the bait
[40:08] on the hook
[40:10] see in other words Divine Healing
[40:12] campaign was to bring in the sick
[40:15] and brother random you've heard him many
[40:17] times even say how dare you come up here
[40:20] and asking God to heal you of this
[40:24] sickness when you're standing there with
[40:26] sin in your life
[40:29] me
[40:31] see the the healing campaign was to get
[40:33] the people to come and they came by the
[40:36] millions see yep and some saw God I will
[40:40] read it after a while it's to prove that
[40:42] God's among you that's what healing is
[40:44] for healing is to prove God is among you
[40:47] all right amen and and that's what took
[40:49] place back there right because that
[40:52] would just debate on the hook
[40:54] all right but now remember
[40:56] you you don't put the bait on the hook
[40:58] and cast it out and then you draw it
[41:01] back in that's just a bait on the hook
[41:02] you know we'll drop back in we take the
[41:04] bait off throw the hook back out now you
[41:06] you don't do that right Duty you got to
[41:08] leave the bait on the hook all right
[41:10] just don't do that all right reason I'm
[41:13] saying that is is people just say well
[41:15] you put it on the one thing yeah see you
[41:18] don't you don't major on a minor but
[41:20] there's one thing about it a minor is a
[41:22] minor
[41:23] but you don't do away with a minor
[41:26] neither do you do away with the bait on
[41:28] the hook right
[41:30] right you turn around a lot of times
[41:31] reuse to catch more fish right with the
[41:34] same bait all right so now going down
[41:36] now while we're at it look at modern
[41:38] events made clear by prophecy 1965 1206
[41:41] uh paragraph 37. now remember this
[41:45] message started first
[41:47] with Divine Healing now this should not
[41:49] be 65 now
[41:51] hey
[41:53] watch what are you saying man
[41:55] now remember this message started first
[41:58] with Divine Healing
[42:00] performing miracles
[42:04] and if God let that go through and a
[42:07] ordinary Church look just like we
[42:10] already had then it wasn't God
[42:16] if he let it go through it just wouldn't
[42:18] God
[42:19] now remember honestly I didn't get to
[42:21] bring this quote but it'll be glad to
[42:23] find it for you brother Brown says that
[42:25] even though you would have a healing
[42:27] campaign or healings and signs and
[42:29] wonders take place he said if it stays
[42:32] with the same old message
[42:35] man he said don't believe it even though
[42:39] there would be signs and wonders so if
[42:41] somebody comes along today with signs
[42:43] and wonders
[42:44] see and still staying with some old
[42:46] denominational message
[42:48] or some Two Souls seven Thunder virtual
[42:51] peruses the river Jordan's Etc in the
[42:53] message right the even though it would
[42:56] come
[42:58] and healing would follow it
[43:01] you're not going to the word of God
[43:02] because each of the healings especially
[43:05] this healing campaign would be the
[43:08] beginning of something that would take
[43:10] all the way to the change of the body
[43:12] right
[43:13] so it can't be different so do you
[43:15] understand what he's saying
[43:17] and remember this message started first
[43:19] with Divine Healing performing Miracles
[43:22] and if God let that grow go through a
[43:25] ordinary church just like we already had
[43:28] then it wasn't God right now watch it
[43:31] God don't have to show off
[43:34] he he don't he don't have to do these
[43:37] things to entertain us
[43:39] like we Americans are used to
[43:41] entertainment but he does it to the to
[43:43] attract the attention of the people that
[43:47] he's fixing to do something that's right
[43:51] right
[43:53] he's fixing to do something
[43:56] all right watch it now leadership
[43:59] 1965 1207 that was 1206 and it's 1207.
[44:04] and any message that comes in a genuine
[44:08] born message of God is different from
[44:12] the old trend
[44:14] I want you
[44:16] when a Divine Healing went forth
[44:19] not long ago did you notice how the
[44:23] impersonators followed it see
[44:25] and every one of them went right in them
[44:28] organizations
[44:30] staying there
[44:32] does anyone know that there had to be a
[44:35] message this one
[44:38] follow that
[44:40] and we're to follow the healing all
[44:42] right
[44:43] why God don't entertain us he attracts
[44:46] our attention with something
[44:48] and when he attracts our attention then
[44:51] he's got the message all right so now
[44:55] you see what I was trying to bring out
[44:59] is when Azusa Street came forward
[45:02] that was a move of God yes sir I believe
[45:06] that the Holy Ghost came himself the
[45:07] prophet said 464 of the seal book amen
[45:11] and as he did then
[45:14] Azusa Street began to dwindled back down
[45:17] a little and as it did then the the
[45:20] Oneness people begin to come forth and
[45:22] and started a move of God
[45:24] and and see that didn't progress too far
[45:27] other than bringing back to the church
[45:29] things that had been lost of the truth
[45:32] of one God and things and you know and
[45:34] sure they run it into a Oneness form but
[45:37] still then here comes the prophet about
[45:39] 1933 see and God coming down to
[45:43] vindicate and show that your message
[45:46] will forerun the second coming of Jesus
[45:48] Christ all right but he didn't just go
[45:51] right out then
[45:53] that's right amen it would be 30
[45:55] something years later before his message
[45:57] would come forth right
[45:59] you know so we're about 63 we're the
[46:02] real message of the Prophet would come
[46:04] but it would be restoring back the
[46:07] understanding of the word of God and to
[46:10] do that to get the attention of the
[46:12] people God sends a healing campaign go
[46:15] ahead
[46:17] so you think you you don't be careful
[46:20] though don't just drop off and say we
[46:22] don't need that anymore right I made
[46:25] myself clear that we'll read to it a
[46:27] minute the prophet says this son of
[46:29] righteousness right when he lives we
[46:30] will go all the way to the Millennium
[46:32] all right
[46:33] until these bodies are changed we need
[46:35] healing amen that's right because that
[46:38] is the ultimate of all healing is the
[46:40] change of the body right that's right
[46:42] all right
[46:43] but see we've got to walk into it in the
[46:46] way that that God wants us to walk right
[46:50] yeah and see we can't go out ahead but
[46:52] we need can we lag behind
[46:54] so there had to be a healing campaign
[46:56] sweep out right
[46:59] to get the attention to the people to
[47:02] come to hear the message but more what's
[47:04] happening than beside this getting the
[47:07] people's attention right
[47:09] that's my will I want to get your
[47:11] attention tonight right I want to make
[47:13] sure you understand what I'm trying to
[47:14] say
[47:15] right see that healing campaign meant
[47:18] more than ever because brother random
[47:19] said that and where you've got them in
[47:21] your hand no Divine Healing no
[47:23] Resurrection that's right amen right he
[47:27] said Divine Healing is the earnest yes
[47:28] amen amen there's a few quotes in there
[47:31] in a minute we'll get to that are real
[47:33] astounding that the prophet would make
[47:35] on these things
[47:37] because he covers if there's no Divine
[47:39] Healing then there is no heaven to go to
[47:44] oh we're gonna get us a new body
[47:47] well we don't need healing anymore then
[47:51] just quit going to the doctors quit
[47:54] taking your medicine and just stop
[47:57] he said that's me himself no it's not
[47:59] being serious it's telling his truth
[48:02] if we don't believe in this body to be
[48:04] able to be redeemed what are we trying
[48:05] to take care of the sucker for
[48:09] all right
[48:12] you see it it just don't pan out right
[48:15] when people try to make their statements
[48:17] and do their things but do you
[48:18] understand what I'm saying in
[48:20] embarrassed where I'm gonna when that
[48:22] started with a healing campaign Dyers
[48:25] were the son of righteousness begin to
[48:28] rise
[48:31] we're healing in his wings
[48:33] because he begins and so we're trying to
[48:35] get the point to him he began to show
[48:38] that there is a possibility of these
[48:40] bodies being changed
[48:42] now that was what was taking place back
[48:45] there amen you say well why we have to
[48:48] do that because all the world was
[48:49] looking to get a new body just like the
[48:51] people in this Mansion you're still
[48:52] looking forward that's right
[48:55] real popular people out on the field
[48:58] don't get a new body
[49:00] and then you hear other people say I'm
[49:02] gonna get me a new body and you don't
[49:03] know what they're talking about yeah
[49:06] because a lot of them goes about and
[49:07] preaches in different places that you
[49:09] know you can say new body and for one
[49:11] group of people it means getting in your
[49:13] body don't need this no more the other
[49:15] side what does he saying oh yeah he's
[49:18] saying this body made new well I like to
[49:21] let you know what I'm talking about
[49:23] why can't we just say this body made new
[49:25] instead of saying we're going to get a
[49:27] new body
[49:28] see when we say we're going to get a new
[49:30] body can put us in a category to fit
[49:32] anywhere
[49:34] they just float with the people and if
[49:37] people get happy about getting a new
[49:39] body we just preach about that one
[49:41] you ain't watch preachers do that
[49:42] they'll pull all this away well they'll
[49:44] pull over this wet wild and it's all
[49:46] right you know
[49:48] but listen
[49:52] the key to understand all things
[49:56] is one fact
[49:58] Jesus raised with nail prints in his
[50:01] hand
[50:04] now did he rage in a natural body
[50:07] rdd erasing it glorified
[50:10] buddy
[50:13] was he still just natural when he raised
[50:16] because you better check your Bible
[50:17] because he raised up and appeared to
[50:20] married and then went up and then came
[50:23] back
[50:26] and then showed his hands in his sides
[50:29] right
[50:31] so you better get the story right of
[50:33] course I didn't go to change nobody but
[50:35] maybe he'll change us here and maybe
[50:37] somebody out there that's hungry enough
[50:39] to listen we'll we'll feed off of that
[50:42] and understand and somebody comes along
[50:43] we bless God we gonna give us a new body
[50:46] brother so-and-so said so I don't give a
[50:48] who what brother so-and-so said that's
[50:50] right what did the Bible say what does
[50:52] the prophet say
[50:54] well I got folks where the Prophet said
[50:56] we're going to give us a new body yes
[50:58] sir and I got plenty of them where he
[50:59] says the resurrection is not replacement
[51:02] right that's right so now you're making
[51:03] your profit a false prophet because
[51:05] you're saying he's teaching one thing
[51:06] one way and another thing another way
[51:10] now I don't believe that
[51:12] is this body made you amen all right now
[51:17] she did it in that point that's the key
[51:20] to it to understand that we don't get a
[51:22] new body right
[51:24] right we get this body redeemed am I
[51:27] now in doing that then I've asked you to
[51:30] read the future home
[51:33] things are ought to be and some of the
[51:34] messages are after the the opening of
[51:37] the you know the seals and the things
[51:38] where the Prophet bringing it down but
[51:40] especially like future home I'm not
[51:42] going to get on that tonight now I'm not
[51:43] going to get on the Redemption of the
[51:45] body
[51:46] that will be on over into Sunday I hope
[51:49] if I get there all right but
[51:53] I want you to hold the point women
[51:55] tonight to see the importance
[52:00] of understanding a simple little thing
[52:04] that we don't get a new body right
[52:07] we get this body redeemed right
[52:11] amen
[52:13] of course they explained it I heard one
[52:15] brother he's explaining it boy he
[52:17] brought it all down and this whole thing
[52:18] here is not worth nothing and he dropped
[52:20] it down and we just walk out on our own
[52:22] bodies into the Millennium in some kind
[52:24] of a glorified theophany form of a body
[52:27] and then in the future home we finally
[52:29] catch back up with it well I don't
[52:31] understand that huh I couldn't
[52:33] understand him I'm not making fun of him
[52:36] that's his business
[52:37] he's saying what he believes
[52:40] yeah I still they say that I'd rather
[52:42] listen to him than most people because
[52:44] most people won't tell you what you
[52:45] believe that's right right
[52:48] most people are just going to leave you
[52:49] in limbo and like I said they'll say I
[52:51] believe in a new body and then they wait
[52:53] to see what you're going to do and then
[52:54] if you don't go this way to go that way
[52:55] yeah you know you watch preachers and
[52:59] they'll do that a lot okay
[53:01] yeah maybe not I shouldn't have said
[53:03] that about preachers but
[53:04] you know it's true that's right
[53:07] but listen I don't have none of that
[53:09] flowing to try to get you to believe
[53:10] this way and then try to get I just got
[53:12] one thing you either gonna believe what
[53:14] I'm saying or forget it yeah I mean I
[53:18] don't have no two sides to me right I've
[53:20] never been that way I've always been one
[53:21] all right so let's read a couple of
[53:24] things that brother Branham had to say
[53:27] about the healing campaigns and the you
[53:30] know
[53:31] of the things that was taking place but
[53:33] I hope you followed my point
[53:35] I'm saying something to you
[53:39] that is a whole lot more valuable than
[53:41] you think
[53:42] now
[53:44] I'm saying something not undercover I'm
[53:47] saying it as the way I want it said
[53:49] exactly to be brought out see we we are
[53:53] if we're not careful we will be looking
[53:56] for something to take place
[53:59] when it's already taking place
[54:03] now brother Randall said one day he said
[54:04] see there said see where the moon will
[54:06] turn to blood he said I can show you
[54:08] where that's already took place well I
[54:10] can't because I can't find where he told
[54:12] me what that was
[54:14] me
[54:15] but he said he knew that it already took
[54:18] place well see we're all still looking
[54:20] for the moon to turn to blood
[54:22] when he said it's done over
[54:25] and see that's what we can do we can be
[54:27] looking I'll put it in here and it's
[54:29] plain language we can be looking for the
[54:31] message of the the to wet the Redemption
[54:34] of the body the message and the message
[54:36] has already come
[54:39] right
[54:40] and like Brother Gary and I were talking
[54:42] the other day if you're still dependent
[54:45] upon something to to have to come forth
[54:48] in some Big Bang Theory or something
[54:50] then there's no difference in what
[54:52] people are saying in in that realm that
[54:55] it is to those that are saying but
[54:57] around's got to come back
[54:59] the biggest portion of people that
[55:01] message had to depend us upon something
[55:03] to happen
[55:05] some kind of something to take place
[55:07] that's why they start running after
[55:09] every little young guy come along or
[55:11] something he's really built up and he's
[55:13] going and everybody just flocks the
[55:15] history
[55:16] Monday night while they just die back
[55:18] down and go floating back into churches
[55:19] again you know
[55:24] I'm looking for something to happen yes
[55:25] but I'm not
[55:28] when it's already happened right
[55:33] if it's already happened I want to tell
[55:35] you it's happened
[55:38] all right so you can that way we'll
[55:41] understand what we're trying to get to
[55:42] but look what you probably had to say on
[55:44] the message of number one on your notes
[55:46] Jesus Christ are saying
[55:48] 62 uh zeros which would be 7 18 1962.
[55:53] and just you read all the others I give
[55:55] it to you I read it you read it and see
[55:56] what is your context or whatever and I
[55:58] just give you something to save time
[56:01] look where he says the Holy Ghost struck
[56:03] first on the West Coast
[56:06] some cross-eyed colored man down here in
[56:09] California
[56:10] Holy Ghost struck on California was
[56:12] speaking in tongues
[56:14] then came
[56:16] Divine Healing campaign
[56:19] I don't know was that what I said want
[56:22] to go sister Street took place then came
[56:24] a Divine Healing campaign see all right
[56:27] the Holy Ghost struck on California was
[56:28] speaking in tongues then came the king
[56:31] healing campaign and here we are at the
[56:34] end time is Jesus Christ the same
[56:36] yesterday today forever
[56:39] as I was with Moses 1951 503.
[56:43] e17. now a few years ago when I started
[56:48] there was none of that going on now back
[56:51] up behind her and read and you'll see
[56:53] that he's talking about healing in
[56:55] certain ways of great success
[57:00] um
[57:01] you back up and you read it right back
[57:03] on your computer backwards he's talking
[57:05] about things uh like every one of them
[57:09] is having such success some way
[57:15] now a few years ago when I started there
[57:18] was none of that going on as I said they
[57:21] could credit Paul Roberts and Billy
[57:23] Graham I mean or Robertson's being with
[57:26] random but actually boy Roberts came out
[57:29] so I wrote a random code right around
[57:30] was the first on the field of Divine
[57:31] Healing
[57:33] you know the big campaign it's a great
[57:34] move of God all right watch
[57:37] he said there was none of that going on
[57:39] the only thing that that this has done
[57:43] and this Supernatural
[57:45] now he's talking about his ministry now
[57:47] what has wakened ministers out of since
[57:51] bound out of the sense-bound realm into
[57:55] a place to where they see God is present
[57:58] I'm gonna watch the purpose of the Duane
[58:00] here
[58:01] to see God is present they take his word
[58:05] start a healing campaign God heals the
[58:08] sick
[58:10] see
[58:11] you say you can search through anywhere
[58:13] you want to and you'll find the
[58:14] supernatural
[58:15] right
[58:16] so what's he saying
[58:19] when he started out
[58:23] there wasn't nobody on the field when he
[58:25] started
[58:26] they came from him
[58:29] all of the great things that took place
[58:31] that came from you he said The
[58:32] Minister's wakened up
[58:35] do these things and started got out of
[58:39] their sensebound realm into a place
[58:41] where they see God is present
[58:44] then they started remember who was it
[58:46] tell Osborne one of them you know said
[58:47] run around should I go do this he said
[58:49] no he said go sit down under that old
[58:51] oak tree of brother Bosworth and listen
[58:53] to him on Divine Healing now brother
[58:55] Bosworth was on the field before brother
[58:57] random came on the field with Divine
[58:59] Healing
[59:01] but it was not having the great effect
[59:05] he would actually come off the field in
[59:07] retirement
[59:08] and then he goes back with brother
[59:10] Branham and starts on with it but see a
[59:13] healing campaign
[59:15] of the supernatural God to get the
[59:18] attention
[59:19] of the people
[59:21] right all right that's not to get the
[59:23] attention of the people to get you
[59:24] healed
[59:25] that's part of it right come on that's
[59:28] part of the thing that's what they were
[59:31] dwelling on healing campaign
[59:35] the blood around says you can't preach
[59:37] healing without preaching salvation and
[59:40] you can't preach salvation without
[59:41] preaching healing right
[59:44] so it was to get the attention of the
[59:46] people and he said the the we don't
[59:48] major on a minor he said
[59:50] preaching of the gospel and saving of
[59:52] the souls is the important thing
[59:55] that was to get the people to come to
[59:57] the meeting get under the presence of
[59:59] God get under the anointing get under
[1:00:01] the thing and get under conviction
[1:00:04] and as it would then it would would go
[1:00:06] forth and they would
[1:00:08] accept Jesus Christ because that's the
[1:00:10] purpose of it
[1:00:11] see
[1:00:12] you don't measure on a minor you you
[1:00:14] don't go with that
[1:00:16] see you try to make it to where that you
[1:00:19] you know the healings and the signs and
[1:00:21] wonders is to be among you even the
[1:00:24] gifts uh what is it in Corinthians even
[1:00:26] the gifts see if the gifts the reason
[1:00:29] the gifts what the prophets say
[1:00:31] he said somebody come in a meeting said
[1:00:33] you have them to meet before and have
[1:00:35] the gifted people they made it in the
[1:00:37] back room and they come out and they
[1:00:38] read and they say make a sister here or
[1:00:40] not she's got a certain certain disease
[1:00:42] because of what she'd done in a certain
[1:00:44] place and here it is and God will heal
[1:00:46] her
[1:00:51] it's not just a Labyrinth of the tongues
[1:00:53] and things
[1:00:56] it was for a purpose
[1:00:59] me
[1:01:00] and that way they'll fall down and
[1:01:02] worship God
[1:01:04] and give honor because they know that
[1:01:07] somebody has told them the truth
[1:01:10] see it's not just a healing campaign
[1:01:12] this healing campaign look at the next
[1:01:15] one we're going to read
[1:01:18] look where it grinds up the son of
[1:01:20] righteousness where it winds up being
[1:01:21] lady will see in church age 1960 12 11
[1:01:25] the evening service paragraph 64. and
[1:01:28] he's coming down sort of righteous
[1:01:29] riding the healing Wing go forward and
[1:01:30] grow up in his paths on the stall you
[1:01:32] shall tread down the wicked for they
[1:01:33] shall be actions on their shoulders your
[1:01:35] feet see that's in the Millennium when
[1:01:36] you're gonna take place and in in that
[1:01:39] ice that I shall do this say up the Lord
[1:01:42] of hosts not the day that he's what's
[1:01:45] not not the day that he shall burn the
[1:01:47] Earth will tread upon their ashes
[1:01:50] that's the Millennium of course
[1:01:53] he so it's going to come to the
[1:01:55] millennial reign
[1:01:57] healing is going to lies until the
[1:02:00] Millennium rain will start coming in
[1:02:02] all right going over just make sure in
[1:02:04] the mountain two or three Witnesses uh
[1:02:06] number four you know it's true sign
[1:02:08] overlooked
[1:02:09] 1961-11-12 and he comes down reading the
[1:02:12] same scripture that fear by now show the
[1:02:13] son of righteous rise of healing in his
[1:02:15] wings and you shall go forth as cash in
[1:02:17] the stall that's the Millennium and you
[1:02:20] shall tread them to Wicked for this
[1:02:21] shall be asked you to understand your
[1:02:22] feet in the day that I do this saith the
[1:02:24] Lord of hosts coming out in the
[1:02:27] Millennium right
[1:02:29] all right
[1:02:30] why would the prophet cover going into
[1:02:33] the millennium
[1:02:40] the kids were going to walk out on the
[1:02:43] ashes
[1:02:45] of the people
[1:02:52] we're going to walk on the ashes of the
[1:02:54] people into the millennium
[1:02:57] because they're going to have to die
[1:02:58] they're going to be killed all right so
[1:03:01] then Divine Healing will come to an end
[1:03:04] all right now you want scripture for it
[1:03:06] remember that when it comes into the
[1:03:08] tribulation in the Book of Revelation it
[1:03:11] says that they will cry to die
[1:03:15] pray for the rocks to fall upon them
[1:03:17] that scripture in the Book of Revelation
[1:03:19] they will be crying out for those things
[1:03:24] and as they do
[1:03:26] they won't come right
[1:03:29] because the healing is already left
[1:03:31] right
[1:03:33] right it's going to the other let me
[1:03:35] look at something one of them you know
[1:03:37] excuse me a second
[1:03:42] I had a question and
[1:03:45] I thought I stuck the answer into my
[1:03:47] Bible
[1:03:49] I'll try I'll get back to it
[1:03:51] if I can find it
[1:03:54] somebody asked me a question and I wrote
[1:03:56] it down and put it in my Bible now I
[1:03:58] can't find a place to put it how far
[1:04:00] but now watch
[1:04:04] see then the sign of the healing
[1:04:10] listen now and you'll understand why all
[1:04:13] of these quotes follow after
[1:04:15] a sign of healing
[1:04:18] is a sign of the Resurrection
[1:04:22] right amen all right
[1:04:24] now the Lord Jesus had that sign right
[1:04:30] all right that's the sign of the son of
[1:04:33] man
[1:04:35] is the resurrection sign all right amen
[1:04:38] Jesus had that sign
[1:04:42] he could guarantee you healing isn't it
[1:04:44] odd brother around him come along he
[1:04:46] said give me 24 year worst cases and
[1:04:47] I'll guarantee you either
[1:04:49] it was a sign
[1:04:53] what a sign of the Resurrection
[1:05:00] so now you see why there had to be a
[1:05:02] healing campaign
[1:05:06] because everybody thought that they was
[1:05:07] going to get a new body
[1:05:09] we had no thoughts of anything about
[1:05:12] getting you know up this body changed
[1:05:17] we were only thinking of getting a new
[1:05:19] one and God would have to create that
[1:05:22] from somewhere to bring it to us right
[1:05:26] and see then God to get that offer of my
[1:05:28] mind he sends a healing campaign
[1:05:31] to show you the resurrection
[1:05:34] is present
[1:05:37] now remember
[1:05:39] my thought while ago don't be looking
[1:05:41] forward to something
[1:05:44] try to find out what's here
[1:05:46] so there when the prophet took off on
[1:05:49] the Divine Healing campaign
[1:05:51] God was showing the world that they
[1:05:54] wasn't going to get a new body
[1:05:57] but how many took that amen I mean in
[1:06:00] the messages took that
[1:06:03] come on
[1:06:05] no they're not going to change from
[1:06:07] their doctrines and their ideas that's
[1:06:09] right right but see
[1:06:12] then the prophet would begin to say
[1:06:17] it's like on the next one Angel of the
[1:06:19] Lord 1951 718 if there's no Divine
[1:06:22] Healing now
[1:06:24] there is no resurrection of the body
[1:06:27] that's right
[1:06:30] Divine Healing is the earnest
[1:06:33] of our redeemed body now notice what it
[1:06:37] said did you ever think of that
[1:06:44] no I kind of put a little marks around
[1:06:47] that where you'd read it and think about
[1:06:49] it
[1:06:50] the prophet said did you ever think of
[1:06:52] that
[1:06:53] of what
[1:06:54] that Divine Healing
[1:06:57] see now
[1:06:59] is showing that there will come a
[1:07:02] resurrection
[1:07:06] because that is the earnest
[1:07:10] of our redeemed body amen
[1:07:13] for God to heal somebody is showing that
[1:07:15] that's an Earnest right amen
[1:07:18] yep all right that's what he said did
[1:07:21] you ever think of that
[1:07:24] now listen to this one
[1:07:26] if there's no Divine Healing
[1:07:30] then when you go to the Grave
[1:07:33] that's all of it
[1:07:35] that's right now read these with me real
[1:07:37] careful look at it
[1:07:41] look what he's saying if there's no
[1:07:43] Divine Healing then when you go to the
[1:07:45] Grave that's all of it
[1:07:49] do you have to get a new body
[1:07:54] but there is Divine Healing
[1:07:57] right
[1:07:59] look what he says
[1:08:01] did you ever think of that if there's no
[1:08:03] Divine healings in there then you when
[1:08:05] you go to the Grave that's all of you
[1:08:07] you'll be there forever and your dust
[1:08:09] will go away and there will be no more
[1:08:12] of you see if there we have the earnest
[1:08:16] of our salvation and completeness back
[1:08:19] the way we was in the Garden of Eden
[1:08:23] I'm looking at you one of them thinking
[1:08:25] of the power and he talks about your
[1:08:27] sister about eating away within a few
[1:08:29] hours to live by cancer by the earnest
[1:08:31] of her redeemed body will put her in the
[1:08:35] condition it is now
[1:08:40] what will it be when she draws the full
[1:08:43] value of the resurrection of Jesus
[1:08:46] Christ
[1:08:47] that's just the you know what the down
[1:08:49] the earnest is the earnest is the down
[1:08:51] payment on anything that holds it a
[1:08:55] surety security now she's just got the
[1:08:58] earnest of it by being healed
[1:09:01] with a hideous capture that would have
[1:09:04] taken her life and here she is sitting
[1:09:06] well and normal
[1:09:11] now brother random
[1:09:13] is tying
[1:09:15] Divine Healing to the Redemption of the
[1:09:18] body
[1:09:19] if you're reading
[1:09:23] for him will I accept 1952 718.
[1:09:29] he's talking about David crying out my
[1:09:31] flesh shall Rest In Hope because he will
[1:09:33] not suffer thy my Holy One to see
[1:09:35] corruption neither will he leave his
[1:09:37] soul in hell
[1:09:39] all back there all pointing to Calvary
[1:09:42] then in Jesus lays the complete of
[1:09:45] Salvation the complete of Divine Healing
[1:09:48] a if there is no Divine Healing now
[1:09:52] there is no resurrection of the Dead
[1:09:55] and I'd like for you to Wade over that
[1:09:58] listen to him yep
[1:10:01] that's right we have the first fruits of
[1:10:03] our inheritances that write the earnest
[1:10:05] of our Salvation he said I'd like you to
[1:10:07] wait over that
[1:10:11] you know stomp around get over the top
[1:10:13] of it get away from it
[1:10:18] okay testimony 1953 1129 the evening
[1:10:21] Services don't let the resurrection
[1:10:23] you're talking about the Dr Bassett who
[1:10:25] he's really talking about you know about
[1:10:27] how he preached the great Camelot
[1:10:29] message
[1:10:31] um you know talking about
[1:10:33] all in the resurrection
[1:10:36] when this Mortal puts on immortality of
[1:10:38] course any Christian believes that that
[1:10:40] there would be a resurrection but if
[1:10:42] there's no attributes of the
[1:10:44] Resurrection if there's no Earnest of
[1:10:46] the Resurrection then there is no
[1:10:48] Resurrection
[1:10:49] if there is no Divine Healing then
[1:10:51] there's no Resurrection now you couldn't
[1:10:54] disprove that if you could by this group
[1:10:57] you couldn't disprove that if you could
[1:11:00] by the scripture see I'm arguing the
[1:11:03] points of Christ see because we have the
[1:11:07] earnest of our Salvation which is the
[1:11:09] baptism of the holy spirit is that right
[1:11:12] that's the down payment the earnest
[1:11:14] which holds it secured heaven for us and
[1:11:17] it's dark then if there is no Divine
[1:11:21] Healing to make a cancer-ridden body
[1:11:23] come back normal and well again there is
[1:11:26] no resurrection of the dead that's right
[1:11:28] we have no no Earnest of it at all
[1:11:32] there's no plan made for it he said that
[1:11:35] sells
[1:11:37] hidden life
[1:11:39] 1956-12 you cannot preach salvation to
[1:11:42] this to the soul without preaching
[1:11:44] bodily healing you just can't do it you
[1:11:48] can't cut the Bible up like that because
[1:11:51] it will it's Inseparable the same man
[1:11:55] died at the cross he was wounded for our
[1:11:57] transgressions with his Christ we were
[1:11:59] healed the same day the blood from the
[1:12:02] same veins so see so see it's
[1:12:05] inseparable
[1:12:07] all right
[1:12:09] I got a point I got to stop on a minute
[1:12:11] so I have to keep looking back at my
[1:12:12] notes Here you am 56 12-15 no one can
[1:12:16] preach salvation without preaching
[1:12:17] Divine Healing see you cannot preach
[1:12:20] Redemption of the Soul without
[1:12:21] repreaching Redemption of the body see
[1:12:24] when you can't deal with sin in any
[1:12:27] measure unless you deal with sickness
[1:12:30] and ever attribute sickness is the
[1:12:33] results of sin
[1:12:35] now are you listening are you following
[1:12:37] no Divine Healing no Resurrection amen
[1:12:42] keep your mind on the thought though God
[1:12:45] brought a Divine Healing campaign
[1:12:47] it would go of healing for the body
[1:12:50] would go all the way
[1:12:52] until the change of this body
[1:12:57] that's why we can believe in you right
[1:13:00] hearing him 1958 301 the evening sir you
[1:13:04] will die Lazarus of Rage from the dead
[1:13:05] but died again see but if there is no
[1:13:08] Divine Healing which is the earnest of
[1:13:10] our Resurrection there is no
[1:13:12] Resurrection
[1:13:13] if there is no freedom from sin and
[1:13:16] living above sin and free from sin then
[1:13:18] there is no heaven to go to
[1:13:21] hmm
[1:13:22] this is just the earnest of our
[1:13:24] Salvation that we have now through the
[1:13:26] works of the Holy Spirit
[1:13:32] life is either 57 611. Jesus came to
[1:13:35] redeem both
[1:13:37] of them so you go back up below there
[1:13:38] and you'll see the bodies full of
[1:13:40] sickness and death is pronounced on it
[1:13:41] and all this that and the other and the
[1:13:43] soul is sick and the body's sick and
[1:13:44] Jesus come to redeem both of them that's
[1:13:46] right not just one his soul he came to
[1:13:50] bring complete Redemption and we only
[1:13:52] have the earnest of our complete
[1:13:54] salvation now
[1:13:56] if there is no Divine Healing now there
[1:13:59] is no resurrection of the body that's
[1:14:00] correct to what's he covered we have the
[1:14:03] earnest of our salvation and our soul we
[1:14:05] have the earnest of their salvation and
[1:14:07] our body
[1:14:10] now
[1:14:11] for him will I accept
[1:14:13] 52 718 the earnest of our redeemed body
[1:14:17] and if God can reach down and take a
[1:14:19] cancer-ridden like Miss Florence
[1:14:21] Nightingale in my book there you who've
[1:14:24] seen it the great granddaughter of the
[1:14:26] Florence Nightingale the founder of the
[1:14:28] Red Cross if God can reach down to that
[1:14:30] poor
[1:14:31] Richard mortal laying there they
[1:14:34] couldn't even raise her hands to shake
[1:14:36] hands hands to shake hands and couldn't
[1:14:39] speak till I speak till I could hear her
[1:14:44] and put her to a hundred and fifty five
[1:14:47] pounds in Perfect nail that's the
[1:14:50] earnest of our resurrected body
[1:14:57] keep on going demonology 1953 608 now
[1:15:00] let's talk about the death side and how
[1:15:03] can a person that on that estate in that
[1:15:05] kind of condition ever be sick all right
[1:15:08] because it's your body is not redeemed
[1:15:12] your body is not redeemed no matter how
[1:15:14] much
[1:15:15] how good you are and how saintly and how
[1:15:18] holy how much Holy Spirit
[1:15:21] that's only your soul and your soul is
[1:15:24] not complete yet it's just got the
[1:15:25] blessings
[1:15:26] the promise of God which is the earnest
[1:15:28] of our salvation but now if we have no
[1:15:31] Earnest of our Resurrection no Divine
[1:15:35] Healing
[1:15:36] then I'll have no Assurance of nothing
[1:15:39] to prove to me that there is a
[1:15:41] resurrection
[1:15:43] all right
[1:15:46] no Divine Healing no Resurrection
[1:15:49] Divine Healing came as a sign
[1:15:53] of the Resurrection
[1:15:55] to get the attention of the people for
[1:15:58] salvation of the Soul
[1:16:03] fundamental Foundation of faith 1955.
[1:16:06] 13 Jesus couldn't come to redeem us from
[1:16:10] just sin without redeeming us from the
[1:16:12] sickness of all the things that goes
[1:16:15] with it are all the things that goes
[1:16:16] with even to death he redeemed us from
[1:16:19] death
[1:16:20] we do not die there is no scripture in
[1:16:22] the Bible it says a Christian is dying
[1:16:23] we have eternal we have everlasting life
[1:16:26] and cannot die God promised to resurrect
[1:16:28] the body in the last days we rest in
[1:16:31] this assurance now we have salvation
[1:16:33] happiness and joy which is the earnest
[1:16:35] of our salvation of our complete
[1:16:38] Redemption someday
[1:16:40] and we have Divine Healing as the
[1:16:42] earnest of our Immortal bodies which is
[1:16:45] coming home
[1:16:46] okay
[1:16:57] Denver's 1960 12 11 morning service I do
[1:17:02] believe in Divine Healing it's one of
[1:17:03] the great doctrines of the Bible
[1:17:06] but Divine Healing has more to it than
[1:17:08] just Divine Healing
[1:17:11] do you read
[1:17:14] now listen to what your Prophet is
[1:17:16] saying that's why I want you to take
[1:17:18] these quotes home and read them
[1:17:23] Divine Healing adds more to it than just
[1:17:25] Divine Healing
[1:17:27] Divine Healing only says that there is a
[1:17:31] God who's coming again
[1:17:34] what does Divine Healing speak up
[1:17:37] it's the earnest of our Resurrection if
[1:17:40] there's no Divine Healing then there is
[1:17:42] no resurrection and if there is no Holy
[1:17:45] Spirit now to baptize us there is no
[1:17:48] eternal life in the world to come this
[1:17:51] is the earnest of our salvation
[1:17:53] all right
[1:17:54] Queen of the South 58 613
[1:17:57] when you pre you inherited
[1:18:00] and when you preach salvation for the
[1:18:02] soul it has to be for the body too now
[1:18:05] it's the earnest of our Redemption if
[1:18:07] there is no Divine Healing there is no
[1:18:09] Resurrection for it's just like the
[1:18:11] earnest the same as the joy of the Lord
[1:18:14] and the Holy Spirit is the earnest of
[1:18:17] our salvation
[1:18:18] okay so good
[1:18:20] Earnest of your healing
[1:18:22] Earnest of your body is what your
[1:18:24] hearing is
[1:18:26] your Resurrection
[1:18:28] okay
[1:18:30] now listen
[1:18:38] now
[1:18:41] if it's unearnished
[1:18:46] and like we read there in one of the
[1:18:48] quotes Brethren said all Christianity
[1:18:49] believes in a resurrection
[1:18:54] now if you're going to believe in the
[1:18:56] resurrection
[1:19:05] you're going to believe in the
[1:19:06] resurrection
[1:19:09] then why would you think you're going to
[1:19:11] get your new body
[1:19:15] because the word Resurrection is to
[1:19:17] bring back what goes down
[1:19:21] true amen you see how flimsy our
[1:19:25] doctrines like run around until that
[1:19:27] lady said that's as thin as a suit made
[1:19:30] off of a shadow of a chicken that
[1:19:31] started to death
[1:19:34] no that's that's cutting pretty good
[1:19:37] y'all think brother Dale's pretty hard
[1:19:39] you need to read a lot
[1:19:42] hey
[1:19:43] he really cut that lady pretty hard
[1:19:46] I mean
[1:19:47] but now listen
[1:19:50] if there's going to be a resurrection
[1:19:54] and resurrect means to bring back that
[1:19:56] that went down
[1:19:58] well now is it going to come back old no
[1:20:00] it's not gonna come back old it's going
[1:20:03] to come back young because your Prophet
[1:20:06] has explained that to it that's what I'm
[1:20:09] saying to you if you'll catch these
[1:20:11] little points Point number two of them
[1:20:13] made one I'm making number two
[1:20:16] your profit
[1:20:18] never spoke of things to come like we
[1:20:21] think
[1:20:22] he would always speak of a present tense
[1:20:28] a present tense
[1:20:31] all right
[1:20:33] see then healing while we're alive
[1:20:37] right
[1:20:38] now while you're alive
[1:20:40] healing is not for the dead right right
[1:20:42] healing is not not for the person that's
[1:20:45] dead right
[1:20:47] no they they're gonna have to be changed
[1:20:50] they're going to be brought up in the
[1:20:51] resurrection all right
[1:20:54] but the Divine Healing that we have
[1:20:58] and that healing campaign that went out
[1:21:00] to the world and brother Branham prayed
[1:21:02] for the sick until his last message
[1:21:09] and in doing that that was a proof of
[1:21:11] the Resurrection
[1:21:14] you agree
[1:21:15] but now listen it wasn't proof of a
[1:21:18] resurrection to come
[1:21:21] 101.2
[1:21:24] is proof of a resurrection that's
[1:21:26] present tense
[1:21:29] that's right
[1:21:31] the resurrection is not a past thing
[1:21:34] it's not a future thing
[1:21:37] it's present tense right
[1:21:41] right I mean now that your prophet
[1:21:46] preached the message
[1:21:50] why are we looking for the missions
[1:21:58] I don't understand you
[1:22:01] you you say why we're looking for the
[1:22:03] message
[1:22:06] remember
[1:22:09] that it doesn't say in Romans 8 um
[1:22:16] the the adoption the change of the body
[1:22:19] it doesn't say the adoption the
[1:22:21] Redemption of the body
[1:22:23] it says the adoption to wit
[1:22:27] to understand the Redemption of the body
[1:22:33] we've got to get that while we're here
[1:22:38] but it's already been brought to us
[1:22:41] all right amen sure amen it's the
[1:22:44] message the prophet brought
[1:22:47] because there's not another message to
[1:22:49] come right
[1:22:50] nor messenger
[1:22:55] right that's point two
[1:22:57] okay
[1:23:00] I said something to brother the other
[1:23:01] day about something he said
[1:23:03] when are you going to explain to me
[1:23:05] about what you said about 9 15 I said
[1:23:08] I'm not going to
[1:23:12] you're allowed to explain that to me
[1:23:17] foreign
[1:23:20] was never dealing with anything in the
[1:23:22] past or in the future
[1:23:24] he was dealing with what's present tense
[1:23:32] the your Resurrection your Prophet said
[1:23:35] his word
[1:23:37] he said it was inside of you all right
[1:23:39] that's right all right well while we're
[1:23:42] looking for a resurrection when it's
[1:23:44] inside of us right
[1:23:48] right all we got to do is get what's
[1:23:49] inside of us outside we got the
[1:23:51] resurrection take place that's right man
[1:23:53] 0.3
[1:23:57] I'm trying to say something to get you
[1:23:59] to think and then later on when I come
[1:24:01] back and it'll just click
[1:24:03] back
[1:24:06] and you'll quit looking for something to
[1:24:08] come
[1:24:12] you'll start looking at what's here
[1:24:16] right it'll take place I mean
[1:24:19] why because
[1:24:22] our bodies
[1:24:25] the prophet said are not redeemed
[1:24:30] no
[1:24:35] we know it we know we're standing here
[1:24:38] in a sinful condition that's not hard to
[1:24:40] understand isn't it right you know
[1:24:44] but for a minute I want you to think
[1:24:46] about his what he's saying here in the
[1:24:47] next couple of quotes
[1:24:52] that there's something been going on
[1:24:55] that's right sure amen there's something
[1:24:58] going on now right
[1:25:06] so you could take one quote and make
[1:25:07] things fall the way over and take
[1:25:09] another and make it no but let's just
[1:25:10] get what he's
[1:25:12] look at who is this Melchizedek number
[1:25:14] 17 on your nose
[1:25:16] 1965 221
[1:25:23] then when you become subject to that
[1:25:25] Spirit it throws your whole being
[1:25:26] subject to that spirit and that spirit
[1:25:28] is nothing in the world but this seed
[1:25:30] word made manifest or Quicken Hallelujah
[1:25:33] Made Alive and when the Bible said don't
[1:25:38] do this that body quickly turns to it
[1:25:41] there's no question and what is it it's
[1:25:44] the earnest of the Resurrection
[1:25:50] now he's dealing now with the earnest of
[1:25:52] the Resurrection as being something
[1:25:54] that's with inside of you right
[1:25:58] not just Divine Healing
[1:26:02] that's my point not just Divine Healing
[1:26:08] is something happening inside of you
[1:26:10] right
[1:26:12] amen
[1:26:16] what is it it's the earnest of the
[1:26:19] Resurrection
[1:26:20] this body will be raised up again
[1:26:22] because it's already started
[1:26:28] what's already started
[1:26:31] the Redemption of the body
[1:26:37] it's already started
[1:26:40] we're looking for the Redemption of the
[1:26:41] body to be walking along like this and
[1:26:43] all at once we run up against the wall
[1:26:44] or we hit something or whatever
[1:26:45] something falls down planner we got
[1:26:47] Redemption
[1:26:51] right
[1:26:53] it's easy to quote
[1:26:57] you know
[1:26:59] our body's not redeemed
[1:27:05] but it's according to your prophet he
[1:27:07] said it's already started right
[1:27:10] I told you I'm not going to get there so
[1:27:12] keep on reading the future home
[1:27:18] and what is it it's the earnest of the
[1:27:21] Resurrection
[1:27:22] this body will be raised up again
[1:27:24] because it's already started it was once
[1:27:27] subject to sin and mire and Corruption
[1:27:29] but now it's got to be earnest
[1:27:33] station
[1:27:35] it's turned Heavenly right
[1:27:38] now that's the earnest that you're going
[1:27:40] into rapture
[1:27:42] it's the earnest
[1:27:46] um
[1:27:47] now he's dealing with something that's
[1:27:49] on the inside of you now watch him drop
[1:27:51] back because how can he cover it any
[1:27:53] other way
[1:27:54] we're going to find in a minute there's
[1:27:56] one in here somewhere brother running so
[1:27:57] this is the top so this here's the top
[1:27:59] now what a sick person laying down
[1:28:01] nothing left but death that's all that
[1:28:03] can happen
[1:28:04] I've seen the shadow of people done eat
[1:28:06] of chatters of people done eat up with
[1:28:09] cancer and tuberculosis and see them
[1:28:11] persons a little while after that
[1:28:13] perfectly normally strong normal and
[1:28:16] strong
[1:28:17] and if that's what if there's no Divine
[1:28:20] Healing then there's no Resurrection
[1:28:22] because Divine Healing is the earnest of
[1:28:24] the Resurrection
[1:28:29] but he's already been telling you up
[1:28:30] above her
[1:28:33] that he's talking about an inward
[1:28:34] Resurrection
[1:28:38] Divine Healing is only speaking of that
[1:28:41] because you'd be sick again
[1:28:49] number 18 and we will cover these two
[1:28:52] again so you could remember them future
[1:28:55] home 1964-802 stage one page 49.
[1:29:00] he's coming down to talk about the
[1:29:02] redeeming of the earth and the thing you
[1:29:04] are part of the earth your body your
[1:29:07] soul is a part of God an attribute of
[1:29:09] God displayed here on Earth in the body
[1:29:11] the bodies to be redeemed
[1:29:14] now the souls redeemed
[1:29:17] because it was in sin so God came down
[1:29:20] by a process of justification
[1:29:22] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:24] and redeems your soul
[1:29:27] and you being part of the Earth
[1:29:29] it's Redeemed by it amen you're in the
[1:29:32] process now it's growing on
[1:29:36] it right so remember those two
[1:29:39] statements
[1:29:41] already in process
[1:29:43] see the Redemption of the body is
[1:29:45] already constantly it says and that's
[1:29:47] what number four
[1:29:51] it's not something to look forward to
[1:29:53] right it's something that we should
[1:29:55] honor and
[1:29:56] realize that it's taking place right now
[1:29:58] all right
[1:30:01] I don't see no difference
[1:30:05] what's that got to do with it
[1:30:08] that's the same thing they said to Jesus
[1:30:13] he never turned around to those people
[1:30:15] when they were talking to him in an
[1:30:17] ungodly way or even to the lady that
[1:30:19] would stand there and say oh yes we
[1:30:22] believe one day Lazarus is going to come
[1:30:26] forth in the resurrection what did he
[1:30:28] say
[1:30:31] he said I am the resurrection
[1:30:36] yeah so she was looking to the end of
[1:30:38] the world of Resurrection
[1:30:41] he said I am the resurrection
[1:30:45] I don't mean to ever press attention
[1:30:48] okay now just for a minute I'm going to
[1:30:50] try to cover something
[1:30:52] all right you've heard the prophet talk
[1:30:54] about
[1:30:56] that Jesus's Ministry had three pools
[1:31:00] and that his ministry had three pools
[1:31:02] and the different things
[1:31:04] and uh
[1:31:06] you know would take place and I want to
[1:31:08] show you from this now to tie back in to
[1:31:11] what we were talking about of the son of
[1:31:14] righteousness writers and with healing
[1:31:15] in his wings to drop all the way back to
[1:31:18] 33 when the prophet began to start a
[1:31:20] healing campaign
[1:31:24] you ever understand what it just said
[1:31:26] we're going to tie this back to what
[1:31:28] we're fixing to cover we're tied back to
[1:31:30] where the Prophet started a healing
[1:31:32] campaign
[1:31:34] and that would be the son of rice to
[1:31:36] this rise when healing to his wings to
[1:31:37] come forth and the message would have to
[1:31:40] follow
[1:31:41] all right
[1:31:42] but still it doesn't mean nothing wasn't
[1:31:44] going it didn't mean there wasn't
[1:31:45] nothing going on
[1:31:48] you better remember that before your
[1:31:50] Prophet went to Arizona that the about
[1:31:52] four or three of those times of the
[1:31:55] third pool had already taken place
[1:31:57] before he went to Arizona sure I'm sure
[1:31:59] of three maybe four might even all five
[1:32:02] of them take a place before then
[1:32:05] right
[1:32:07] so he said
[1:32:09] that Jesus had three pools amen
[1:32:16] first pull is to heal the sick
[1:32:22] now don't have time to get back into the
[1:32:24] scriptures but you ought to know it
[1:32:25] enough and you can go in there in the
[1:32:26] gospels and find it
[1:32:29] that the Lord Jesus had a marriage had a
[1:32:31] supper it was a wedding to take place or
[1:32:33] a married supper
[1:32:36] and he sent out
[1:32:38] invitations and people didn't come
[1:32:42] right
[1:32:44] that's right
[1:32:46] and they come and told him said most of
[1:32:48] the people hadn't come
[1:32:53] he said
[1:32:54] go out and get the sick the lame the
[1:32:57] Hulk
[1:33:01] bring them in
[1:33:06] remember that in the scripture that's
[1:33:07] right yep
[1:33:09] they went out and got them they still
[1:33:11] wasn't enough
[1:33:13] he said go out in the highways and
[1:33:15] hedges and compel them to come right
[1:33:19] because I'm gonna have a wedding
[1:33:22] all right now you're following that
[1:33:24] pretty cool
[1:33:26] the second pool of the Lord Jesus was
[1:33:28] what Healing The Sick
[1:33:30] going out
[1:33:34] the second pool of brother Branham was
[1:33:35] what Healing The Sick is that what he
[1:33:37] said it is
[1:33:41] then you can say knowledge the first
[1:33:42] fool well you better tie it together now
[1:33:43] and get it over to where you understand
[1:33:46] the I know the quote First full of
[1:33:49] healing second holds prophecy
[1:33:51] so remember my point
[1:33:53] a message will always follow right
[1:33:59] the Lord Jesus had a message that he was
[1:34:02] preaching and he was doing the first
[1:34:04] pull under his message of Healing The
[1:34:06] Sick he was preaching the message which
[1:34:09] was the second poor
[1:34:11] and then one day he was preaching to the
[1:34:13] totally lost under the third book
[1:34:16] okay
[1:34:17] now so would it happen with brother
[1:34:19] Brown
[1:34:20] so look what he said is your life worthy
[1:34:22] of the Gospel
[1:34:24] 1963
[1:34:26] 6 30 the evening service
[1:34:29] I'm not getting on your notes
[1:34:31] now why did you notice there was three
[1:34:32] pools or three turns of it
[1:34:35] when they went out first and called to
[1:34:38] them that were bidden to come and they
[1:34:39] didn't do it so there went out a healing
[1:34:42] campaign
[1:34:43] went out to get the blind in the Halt
[1:34:46] and still there was was room still there
[1:34:49] were room so he went out and compelled a
[1:34:53] good bad into indifferent that they
[1:34:55] should come right
[1:34:59] wedding supper
[1:35:02] 1956 1006.
[1:35:05] go out and start a healing campaign
[1:35:09] bring in the lane the Blind and the halt
[1:35:13] and everybody hollers today about
[1:35:15] healing campaigns to get a crowd
[1:35:18] what's the matter with you preacher
[1:35:21] that's the light of the Bible
[1:35:24] that's right go get the lame and the
[1:35:26] halt that's the last call before the
[1:35:29] coming of the Lord according to the
[1:35:31] Bible go out and call a healing campaign
[1:35:36] Miracles and signs and wonders will be
[1:35:39] done and bring them in because I'm going
[1:35:41] to have my stable set full
[1:35:43] amen I've made it I've killed my family
[1:35:46] and I'm going to have a real supper and
[1:35:48] you go out and bring in the lame and the
[1:35:50] halt the blind The Afflicted brother
[1:35:52] that's real that's a meal call Divine
[1:35:56] Healing is the program of today
[1:35:58] that's God's last call is Divine Healing
[1:36:03] and then these Fellers that wouldn't
[1:36:05] accept it and set back with their big
[1:36:08] old dry theology
[1:36:10] tries to say that we put Divine Healing
[1:36:13] in the paper to get a crowd Jesus said
[1:36:16] to amen that would make a Baptist Shout
[1:36:20] Jesus sent him out
[1:36:24] you understand what he says and they say
[1:36:25] you sent out all these papers you're
[1:36:27] doing this
[1:36:28] is that what Jesus done
[1:36:33] Jesus told him to go out and bring him
[1:36:34] in
[1:36:37] see this thing's going to tie now to the
[1:36:40] to the
[1:36:42] three pools
[1:36:47] so when it started back there with the
[1:36:49] prophet I said he quit letting people
[1:36:51] preach for him
[1:36:53] he started preaching his own because
[1:36:55] it's the same time that he was that the
[1:36:57] sign of the Messiah was in the prophet
[1:37:00] the real sound of the Messiah was the
[1:37:02] message the prophet was bringing right
[1:37:08] there's your real fact
[1:37:11] the message the man was bringing
[1:37:16] the other was to get attention
[1:37:19] but it ties with the first second and
[1:37:21] third pool
[1:37:25] go out
[1:37:27] get the lame in the home in other words
[1:37:29] I have a healing campaign because it's
[1:37:32] fixing to take place that something's
[1:37:34] going to happen
[1:37:36] something's going to take place
[1:37:41] son of righteousness is going to have to
[1:37:42] rise with healing in his wings
[1:37:46] resurrection of Lazarus
[1:37:48] 1958-13 and if God made a way for a
[1:37:52] flower to live again what about a man
[1:37:54] that's made in His image the freeze
[1:37:56] might come but when a man is Born Again
[1:37:58] of the spirit of God there's life in
[1:38:01] there
[1:38:02] eternal life that'll stand to freeze and
[1:38:04] when the son of righteousness Rises with
[1:38:06] healings in his wings that'll be a
[1:38:09] church to go up to meet him in there
[1:38:10] that's right amen
[1:38:16] God will
[1:38:18] again bring a resurrection
[1:38:22] brother Branham had the resurrection
[1:38:24] sign
[1:38:28] that was the sound of the Messiah
[1:38:31] they didn't make rather random God
[1:38:35] it was the sign of the Messiah
[1:38:38] the son of man
[1:38:41] the resurrection sign right
[1:38:43] that's why he could guarantee your
[1:38:45] healing see nobody else can't do it I
[1:38:47] can't do that ain't no man in the world
[1:38:48] could tell you I guarantee you Heathen
[1:38:50] right
[1:38:51] I can say it like this you believe God's
[1:38:53] word not guaranteed
[1:38:55] but I can't guarantee it myself but
[1:38:57] brother Brown said you bring me 24 us
[1:38:58] cases and I'll guarantee you
[1:39:01] sure why because he had the resurrection
[1:39:04] sign
[1:39:06] the resurrection sign would be exactly
[1:39:09] like the Lord Jesus was when he was here
[1:39:11] on Earth
[1:39:12] that when he first started out they
[1:39:14] listened to him but then he began to
[1:39:17] bring his message while he was Healing
[1:39:19] The Sick and raising the dead and they
[1:39:22] got where they wouldn't listen to it
[1:39:23] it's not that exactly what happened with
[1:39:25] our prophet in the last days that's
[1:39:27] right
[1:39:28] sure
[1:39:30] identically the same thing
[1:39:35] right 1954 305 God's provided way of
[1:39:38] healing of dealing excuse me dealing
[1:39:40] with sin
[1:39:43] he talks about God shining on us the
[1:39:45] Holy Spirit and give us a birth as the
[1:39:47] morning Stars reflected a lot of the
[1:39:49] absence of Christ by his power and
[1:39:51] demonstration the church sheds forth a
[1:39:54] light in this dark time soon daylight
[1:39:56] will come and the son of righteousness
[1:39:58] would rise with healings in his wing
[1:40:01] this Mortal will take on immortality
[1:40:04] and he's not talking just about Divine I
[1:40:07] mean just talking about healing is he
[1:40:09] he's talking about Divine Healing that's
[1:40:11] why they couldn't understand brother
[1:40:12] Branham and see they were actually
[1:40:13] printing it in a way when they would say
[1:40:16] Divine Healing
[1:40:17] me
[1:40:18] and and to the human mind when you say
[1:40:21] Divine Healing that means that uh what
[1:40:26] you're saying is is the heat you can
[1:40:28] never be sick again
[1:40:29] you see that was against brother Brown
[1:40:31] because they called him a Divine healer
[1:40:33] he says I'm not a Divine leader
[1:40:35] but see he uses the word Divine Healing
[1:40:37] a lot of time because if you're healed
[1:40:40] that's Divine I don't care if the
[1:40:43] Beatles are singing the song
[1:40:45] and God healed
[1:40:47] the healing is divine because God does
[1:40:50] it right right now so it is to find
[1:40:53] Healing to end with an ultimate what a
[1:40:55] change of the Bible
[1:41:03] they just didn't know what he was
[1:41:04] talking about that's right how many of
[1:41:07] the people that makes you now knows what
[1:41:08] he's talking about
[1:41:16] immortality
[1:41:21] Resurrection immortality
[1:41:24] I'm talking about Resurrection from the
[1:41:26] dead of the person in the ground I'm
[1:41:27] talking about our Resurrection your
[1:41:29] Resurrection lays inside of you right
[1:41:32] amen
[1:41:34] all right
[1:41:38] this Mortal will take will take on
[1:41:40] immortality we'll see him as he is and
[1:41:43] be made like unto him his own glorious
[1:41:46] body and she'll never be sick for a
[1:41:48] headache or disappointments that's what
[1:41:50] we're waiting for the Sun
[1:41:53] message Faith
[1:41:55] 1956 815 when the son of righteous rides
[1:41:58] with healings in his wings these old
[1:42:00] bodies will be made immortal
[1:42:05] the soul that's tempted and tossed about
[1:42:07] will then be stable forever in the
[1:42:10] presence of God Amen Watchmen what other
[1:42:14] than that 58 11 30 the shadows of
[1:42:16] falling Christ is appearing that's why
[1:42:18] signs and wonders are appearing it's
[1:42:21] that great satellite reflecting off of
[1:42:23] the morning stars with the healings in
[1:42:25] his wings
[1:42:28] and if he will bring healing from the
[1:42:30] reflection of his presence what will he
[1:42:32] do when he comes in person that's right
[1:42:35] these corruptible bodies of ours will be
[1:42:38] changed and be made like unto his own
[1:42:40] glorious body what will it be when he
[1:42:42] comes
[1:42:44] until he comes we're thankful for the
[1:42:47] sunlight of his presence as the morning
[1:42:49] stars do I climbed around for some glory
[1:42:52] and sitting there to heal his coming in
[1:42:55] this dark hour
[1:43:01] and about three more so I know
[1:43:06] Simeon and Anna 1959 to 11. talk about
[1:43:11] eternal life and someday when Jesus
[1:43:13] comes though we be dust when the son of
[1:43:16] righteousness rise was healing in his
[1:43:18] wings this Mortal will take on
[1:43:19] immortality and we shall be resurrected
[1:43:22] and caught up to meet him in the air
[1:43:24] each one of those hands give them
[1:43:27] eternal life for we ask it in Jesus name
[1:43:31] the testimony of a true witness
[1:43:33] 61-1105 he's talking about coming down
[1:43:35] to another season That season will come
[1:43:37] will be the immortal season
[1:43:40] and when the Son of God Rising with
[1:43:42] healing in his wings it'll be totally
[1:43:44] impossible to hold those bodies in the
[1:43:45] ground any longer
[1:43:47] they'll come forth in the brightness of
[1:43:50] the Son of God very nature except
[1:43:52] testifies of it Divine Healing here
[1:43:54] proves resurrection's coming from there
[1:43:57] right amen right
[1:43:59] amen
[1:44:01] God has a provided way
[1:44:03] 1962 728 and as the sun as you as the
[1:44:08] SUV rises in the East and sits in the
[1:44:10] West
[1:44:11] the gospel of the s-o-n Rose in the East
[1:44:15] and setting in the West
[1:44:18] and now the same Sun that rises into
[1:44:21] East s-u-n is the sunning Sun that sets
[1:44:24] in the west and the same s-o-n
[1:44:27] Hallelujah that through his light of
[1:44:29] gospel and Power in his Messiah signed
[1:44:33] to the Eastern people in the last days
[1:44:36] now the clouds has cleared back away
[1:44:38] from the church and the son Rises with
[1:44:42] healing in his wings and brings forth
[1:44:44] from the power for the power evidence of
[1:44:48] his resurrection that He Still Remains
[1:44:50] the Son of God it shall be light in the
[1:44:52] evening time
[1:44:56] 1964 11 12 or 112 excuse me shalom
[1:45:02] I don't know how he's going to do it
[1:45:05] but his spoken word will be of indicated
[1:45:08] with the son of righteousness shall rise
[1:45:10] with healings in his wings
[1:45:11] and the healing part there will not be a
[1:45:16] physical healing as you think
[1:45:20] as saying somebody's got a sickness and
[1:45:22] it'll be taken away from them
[1:45:24] that's what he's doing now in time
[1:45:28] but the whole creation will be changed
[1:45:31] this Mortal will take on immortality
[1:45:33] this this old age will jump into youth
[1:45:35] amen
[1:45:37] he said I don't know but it'll be there
[1:45:40] I don't know but it'll be there
[1:45:42] I don't know how but it'll be there
[1:45:46] take on these things
[1:45:48] the son of righteousness Rises with
[1:45:50] healing in his wings goes all the way to
[1:45:52] the change of the body
[1:45:54] tied back together to the prophet said
[1:45:57] that Jesus had three pulls and under his
[1:45:59] second pull he was preaching the gospel
[1:46:01] and the healing signs and wonders was
[1:46:04] taking place the prophet of God was
[1:46:06] preaching the message and as it was
[1:46:09] signs and wonders was taking place but
[1:46:11] it was proof of the Resurrection
[1:46:14] he had the resurrection sign and it was
[1:46:17] the proof of the Resurrection that a
[1:46:19] person could stand there that had been
[1:46:21] totally sick all over like that if you
[1:46:24] ever seen that picture of that uh little
[1:46:26] girl he's talking about Florence
[1:46:27] nightingale's granddaughter where it was
[1:46:29] and seeing her standing there her legs
[1:46:32] is about that big around and just dying
[1:46:34] and but yet God miracally healed her
[1:46:38] see why
[1:46:40] because the prophet had the resurrection
[1:46:42] signed right
[1:46:46] the son of man could raise the Dead
[1:46:51] that's where people somebody said you're
[1:46:52] welcome they're saying now that Jesus
[1:46:54] couldn't forgive sins but according to
[1:46:55] my Bible the son of man can amen I don't
[1:46:58] know about that
[1:47:00] I just haven't believe what the word
[1:47:01] says
[1:47:02] but now listen
[1:47:06] because we're closed listen to one point
[1:47:11] they're in 33 when that stroke of the
[1:47:14] healing campaign
[1:47:18] maybe you didn't think I meant what I
[1:47:20] said or was listening God sent down
[1:47:23] proof that we was not going to get a new
[1:47:26] body
[1:47:28] he sent healing in a miracle is signed
[1:47:31] around the world
[1:47:34] to prove the resurrection was present
[1:47:37] right the prophet just stepped right
[1:47:40] into that Ministry
[1:47:42] and begin to speak
[1:47:44] and God came and honored his word
[1:47:49] but he knew there was a message coming
[1:47:51] that's right
[1:47:54] if they couldn't stand an healing
[1:47:56] campaign message
[1:47:57] what would they do when he began to say
[1:48:00] I and my father won
[1:48:03] he said when you begin to say I'm my
[1:48:05] father one of these other things he said
[1:48:07] the shark will pull away
[1:48:09] amen
[1:48:11] so you see a vast Gap beginning to form
[1:48:13] into people of the message that some are
[1:48:15] wanting to go on into the message
[1:48:17] realizing that the resurrection sign has
[1:48:19] come in the resurrection is in the
[1:48:21] message
[1:48:23] number five nope okay
[1:48:26] the resurrection is in this message
[1:48:30] you say well it's inside of you that's
[1:48:31] right because I'm hoping God's inside of
[1:48:33] you because if God is inside of you the
[1:48:35] resurrection is not inside of you
[1:48:37] okay is that blood enough if the Holy
[1:48:41] Ghost is inside of you the resurrection
[1:48:43] is inside of you but if he ain't inside
[1:48:44] the uterus Rex is not inside of you so
[1:48:47] you don't have to worry about it
[1:48:50] but you see it's got to connect to that
[1:48:51] message
[1:48:54] amen my Prophet stood there and he said
[1:48:57] I knew this message was coming
[1:49:01] because it's got to follow it
[1:49:04] and he said if healing Goes Forth in a
[1:49:06] great healing campaign and stays with
[1:49:09] the old message
[1:49:11] he said don't listen
[1:49:16] why
[1:49:18] because healing and signs and wonders is
[1:49:21] a sign that God is here
[1:49:23] that's right not that God is coming in
[1:49:27] now
[1:49:29] number six
[1:49:32] God is not coming right your Prophet
[1:49:35] said I'm not saying he's coming I'm
[1:49:39] saying he's here
[1:49:41] if he's here to raise the dead and heal
[1:49:44] the sick he's here
[1:49:47] he was here to bring his own message
[1:49:50] through that prophet
[1:49:53] prophet
[1:49:55] and that message will take you and I to
[1:49:57] a change
[1:49:59] he'll take you and I to a change
[1:50:02] because it's already inside of you
[1:50:04] that's right
[1:50:06] it's not something to come we already
[1:50:08] got the message
[1:50:11] if it's not as I say it in Romans again
[1:50:14] there to say it it doesn't say
[1:50:16] the adoption the Redemption of the body
[1:50:19] or change or it says the adoption to wit
[1:50:22] to understand the Redemption of stand
[1:50:24] together that's right the Redemption of
[1:50:26] the body
[1:50:28] to understand it
[1:50:30] you've got to have a revelation before
[1:50:32] you can be delivered right
[1:50:35] right if you're sick you've got to have
[1:50:37] a revelation to show you that you're
[1:50:39] healed right right
[1:50:43] if you're lost you've got to have a
[1:50:45] revelation to show you're saved
[1:50:51] so why don't we pray to Revelation right
[1:50:53] go ahead
[1:50:54] 596
[1:50:56] in this power book anybody have a need
[1:51:24] less Europe I know we'll start again
[1:51:27] huh start with the course now start with
[1:51:31] the course now
[1:51:40] and my mind is
[1:52:00] it must be gone here in my soul
[1:52:05] I feel
[1:52:10] you
[1:52:11] I feel alone
[1:52:16] I hear
[1:52:18] you
[1:52:39] foreign
[1:53:18] our love again
[1:53:30] for sure that I preached the whole
[1:53:34] building
[1:53:49] it's all the pool
[1:53:51] once you receive that humorous
[1:53:59] very hard
[1:54:02] previously the birds
[1:54:05] then it's a pull on their body
[1:54:08] because the work has already begun
[1:54:15] drawing control
[1:54:19] change
[1:54:40] in my heart
[1:54:46] to me
[1:55:06] in case you just feel something is going
[1:55:08] on
[1:55:09] amen look around the world see what's
[1:55:12] taking place that's right look at all of
[1:55:16] the world falling apart
[1:55:18] he just caving in
[1:55:21] just
[1:55:24] it's gone isn't it that's right I was
[1:55:26] talking last night because yesterday
[1:55:28] Brother Gary and Harry and I
[1:55:31] see about 1980 I said this way back then
[1:55:33] and I still say it
[1:55:35] because long about that time when they
[1:55:37] first reached the Moon
[1:55:39] your Prophet said that going to another
[1:55:41] planet was a type of the Rapture in a
[1:55:44] planetary travel was a type of the
[1:55:46] Rapture when they reached the Moon
[1:55:49] there's not been a lot of advancement in
[1:55:51] science as far as the physical Point
[1:55:55] like that right because they reached the
[1:55:58] goal
[1:56:00] sure now they're wanting to go on all
[1:56:02] out into the space you know and they're
[1:56:03] wanting to go and they're making ships
[1:56:05] and they're doing and preparing yeah but
[1:56:07] they wouldn't that Force BC we were
[1:56:10] fighting with Russia
[1:56:11] trying to get ahead of them and Russia
[1:56:14] was trying to get ahead of us and you
[1:56:16] know to go to to the Moon
[1:56:19] hey put up a rocket and we'd put up a
[1:56:22] rocket and this would happen that one
[1:56:23] happened
[1:56:26] but see now there's not a lot of doing
[1:56:28] that
[1:56:30] but don't miss this
[1:56:34] along about that time they started
[1:56:36] electronical situations that exist today
[1:56:40] in this world that
[1:56:43] is on
[1:56:45] unimaginable to the human mind
[1:56:49] they used to have a telephone that you
[1:56:51] had to have a line to run here to
[1:56:52] California
[1:56:53] right a wire had to be run then they
[1:56:57] wound up making what they call what is
[1:56:59] it monofilament is that the word for it
[1:57:01] they started making this thing that
[1:57:02] could carry hundreds and thousands of
[1:57:06] phone calls through one
[1:57:08] fiber option through one thing they
[1:57:12] didn't need millions of cables they had
[1:57:15] just one cable that would carry millions
[1:57:17] of phone calls
[1:57:20] and just go
[1:57:22] and it'd all be in there and nobody's
[1:57:24] Crossing each other at all
[1:57:28] sleeping that wasn't nothing
[1:57:30] because now you can take your cell phone
[1:57:32] and you can dial it you can speak to
[1:57:33] somebody in Russia China
[1:57:36] you just that's right from a cell phone
[1:57:43] there's so much of that going on and you
[1:57:45] think those are not bothering they're
[1:57:46] still talking about the cell phones just
[1:57:49] can damage your
[1:57:52] head yep
[1:57:53] because of you using it so close
[1:57:56] and things because well it's got to be
[1:57:59] waves but now they say that what is that
[1:58:02] word for it now somebody help me it's
[1:58:04] not a bandwidth but it's something
[1:58:06] similar to that
[1:58:07] it is a place that they can't put any
[1:58:10] more in there
[1:58:12] that's right so they're going to have to
[1:58:14] create something else
[1:58:17] high definition they're going to have to
[1:58:20] create another way Bob and them can tell
[1:58:23] you about it there
[1:58:24] they're gonna have to do something right
[1:58:27] to be able to handle this thing
[1:58:31] those are Supernatural
[1:58:34] amen
[1:58:35] they could turn right around now and
[1:58:37] they can go through that and they can
[1:58:39] pick up your telephone conversation
[1:58:42] and bring that conversation right back
[1:58:45] and play it to you to prove you made
[1:58:47] that phone call
[1:58:48] sure but where is it coming from
[1:58:58] they even spoke way back a long time ago
[1:59:00] and said it
[1:59:02] they believed that they had tapped into
[1:59:03] that they could hear voices down in Hell
[1:59:05] crying out
[1:59:11] so with all that foolishness
[1:59:16] it's working yeah
[1:59:18] see the advancement of trying to go on
[1:59:21] that way now if you get the point it's
[1:59:23] turned back here
[1:59:26] the advancement of science here is now
[1:59:28] so Superior until
[1:59:32] in Kuwait which is what 20 years ago
[1:59:34] they said they could lay a quarter on
[1:59:36] the ground and from outer space they
[1:59:38] could tell you where it was head or
[1:59:39] tails
[1:59:43] yeah that's 20 years ago
[1:59:48] used to you you've argued about
[1:59:50] wiretapping because you couldn't hear
[1:59:52] somebody
[1:59:54] now they just listen all they want to
[2:00:00] get my point
[2:00:02] the inner planetary travel was the last
[2:00:05] great goal of mankind
[2:00:07] because that's the top of the rapture
[2:00:11] right
[2:00:13] the Rapture is going to be here right
[2:00:15] right that's right
[2:00:18] was the Rapture here
[2:00:22] the mysterious things are happening in
[2:00:25] this life
[2:00:29] they could just about do anything yep
[2:00:36] they had to do that in the in
[2:00:37] remembering the tire Bible because
[2:00:39] nothing with Earth was in Genesis maybe
[2:00:41] afford to flood because nothing was
[2:00:43] withholding from mankind
[2:00:46] scientific achievements
[2:00:51] they're still working on decomposing the
[2:00:54] human body and send it to California and
[2:00:55] put it back together
[2:00:57] prophet of God said one day we'll travel
[2:00:58] like I thought
[2:01:03] see how all these things are so close
[2:01:05] that's right don't look out there
[2:01:09] look right here
[2:01:13] don't try to find what tomorrow is doing
[2:01:17] right here that's right all right like
[2:01:20] on these times father
[2:01:24] we just asked you to help us to
[2:01:25] understand
[2:01:27] because that's what we need more than
[2:01:29] anything in the world is an
[2:01:30] understanding
[2:01:32] a revelation not a hit knowledge not an
[2:01:35] intellectual conception that can do such
[2:01:38] marvelous things in this world
[2:01:40] until it's almost a supernatural world
[2:01:43] that we're living in
[2:01:47] but yet of God that can speak to the
[2:01:49] heart of an individual
[2:01:51] and lead each one of us bless Lord do
[2:01:53] sick among us reach down and touch each
