[9:14] impart amen how many Believers the word
[9:16] can change you amen I tell you that's a
[9:19] never changing method that the prophet
[9:21] taught us that when God wants to do
[9:23] something he uses his word amen so no
[9:26] matter what you have need of this
[9:28] evening I believe with all my heart
[9:29] heart that God can change it by the
[9:31] power of His word amen there's not a
[9:33] need too great there's not a problem too
[9:36] great that our God cannot solve just by
[9:38] the power of His word we just want to go
[9:40] to the Lord in a word of prayer uh
[9:42] before we look to the word and uh maybe
[9:44] if you have a need upon your heart you
[9:46] want to lift your hand up to the Lord
[9:47] and and ask the Lord to come by your way
[9:50] I I believe we're in a special place
[9:52] tonight uh whenever we're gather
[9:53] together in his presence a supernatural
[9:55] can happen lives can be changed Hearts
[9:58] can be touched
[10:00] and uh I believe that he's made a way
[10:01] that we can touch him so let's just bow
[10:03] our heads and hearts together and have a
[10:05] word of prayer Lord Jesus we come to
[10:07] your throne of grace and mercy Lord and
[10:10] how we love to assemble together in your
[10:12] name and Lord we know that you gave us a
[10:14] promise in your word that where two or
[10:16] three will gather together in that name
[10:17] that you'll be here and Lord we believe
[10:20] with all of our hearts that we're a
[10:22] supernatural God is as the supernatural
[10:25] things take place and Lord we just
[10:27] invite you to come Lord and and to walk
[10:29] up and down the aisles and avenues of
[10:31] our hearts and speak to us Lord the
[10:33] things that we have need of Lord no
[10:35] doubt there's people in here that may be
[10:37] discouraged or going through things or
[10:40] battling things but Lord we know that
[10:42] there's not a need too great that you
[10:44] can't answer father there is not a
[10:46] sickness too great that you can't heal
[10:48] and so Lord we're just inviting your
[10:50] presence to come Lord and to to minister
[10:53] Like Only You Can Do Lord the the
[10:55] ability of man will only go so far Lord
[10:58] but we believe that you have a
[11:00] inexhaustible ability to meet every need
[11:02] that we've got so Lord we just invite
[11:04] you to come Lord I pray that you'd help
[11:06] me to get out of your way and help your
[11:08] children Lord to to get out of your way
[11:10] also Lord may you anoint our ears anoint
[11:13] our hearts Lord to hear and receive the
[11:15] word that we have need of Lord we just
[11:17] give you this service and Lord when the
[11:19] final amen is said we'll be sure that we
[11:21] give you and you alone all the glory and
[11:24] the honor and the praise it's in the
[11:26] Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ we pray
[11:29] amen and amen amen if you have your
[11:32] Bibles we'll read here in the scripture
[11:34] together in the book of Hebrews in the
[11:36] sixth chapter we'll begin reading at the
[11:38] 13th verse and also in the Book of
[11:41] Romans and the 8th chapter I don't know
[11:44] if you have any monitor here my voice is
[11:46] kind of weak so whatever you all can do
[11:48] to to help that's a lot of help right
[11:50] there down just a little bit that's good
[11:53] thank you amen do you love the Lord
[11:55] tonight amen how many come expecting to
[11:57] hear something from the Lord amen I
[11:59] believe what the prophet said he said
[12:01] that Jesus would never disappoint us so
[12:04] uh no matter what you need if you just
[12:06] expect it you know uh the prophet taught
[12:08] so much on expectation he said if you're
[12:10] expecting to find something to criticize
[12:13] he said the devil will show you
[12:14] something every single time you'll find
[12:17] something to be critical about if you
[12:19] want to but if you're coming uh to God
[12:21] and saying Lord I need you to do
[12:23] something in my life then the prophet
[12:25] said then God will always meet that
[12:27] expectation no matter what
[12:29] and so we just believe that and uh we
[12:31] just want to bring you greetings uh this
[12:33] evening also before we read the word and
[12:35] uh we bring you greetings from our
[12:37] pastor brother Josh Bennett back in
[12:38] North Carolina brother Tim and brother
[12:40] Richard and the different Ministry you
[12:42] all are acquainted with and they wanted
[12:44] to be sure and greet you and we just
[12:46] appreciate brother Wade and the
[12:47] invitation to come and uh we count on a
[12:49] great blessing to speak to you tonight
[12:51] but uh we want to read here in the word
[12:53] together and uh Hebrews the sixth
[12:55] chapter we begin reading at the 13th
[12:58] verse the Bible would read this for when
[13:00] God made promise to Abraham because he
[13:03] could swear by no greater he swore by
[13:06] himself amen what a promise saying
[13:09] surely blessing I Will Bless thee and
[13:11] multiplying I will multiply thee and I
[13:14] want you to notice something very
[13:16] powerful in this 15th verse and so after
[13:20] he had patiently
[13:21] endured so there's a there's a a
[13:24] patience that Abraham is having to have
[13:27] after he patiently endured
[13:29] he obtained the promise let's read also
[13:33] in the Book of Romans the 8th chapter
[13:35] very familiar scripture to us Romans 8
[13:40] 28 amen I believe this is one of them
[13:42] what you call refrigerator magnet
[13:44] scriptures but it's exactly uh the truth
[13:47] and it's very encouraging uh to the
[13:49] believer Romans 8:28 for we know that
[13:52] all things amen you need to say that to
[13:55] yourself all things so that covers what
[13:58] that cover covers all things we know
[14:01] that all things work together for the
[14:03] good to them that love God to them who
[14:05] are called according to his purpose for
[14:08] whom he did for know he also did
[14:10] predestinate to be conformed to the
[14:12] image of his son that he might be the
[14:14] first born born among many Brethren and
[14:17] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[14:20] he also called and whom he called them
[14:23] he also Justified and whom he justified
[14:26] them he also glorified amen we just ask
[14:29] that God will bless his word as you can
[14:30] be seated and uh if I would take a
[14:33] subject I want to speak to you this
[14:34] evening on enduring Until the End Amen
[14:38] enduring until the end and there's many
[14:40] uh scriptures and places that you read
[14:42] about enduring here in one place in Mark
[14:45] 13 and 13 uh Jesus speaking here he said
[14:48] and ye shall be hated of all men for my
[14:51] name's sake but he shall that endure and
[14:54] the end the same shall be saved and and
[14:57] you'll find many scriptures that speaks
[14:59] about enduring so we know uh that it's
[15:02] not about who has started the race we
[15:04] can all look back in the past and say
[15:06] there there's been a lot of young people
[15:08] that started off there's been a lot of
[15:10] people that were uh used to be here but
[15:12] they're not here anymore and there's a
[15:15] lot of people that start off uh uh
[15:17] living for the Lord and and and and and
[15:19] coming to church and living a good and
[15:22] Sanctified life but see it's not all
[15:24] just about uh the ones that have started
[15:27] this but see it's about the on that end
[15:30] or it's about the ones that endure until
[15:32] the end and that's what Jesus is saying
[15:34] here he said but he that will endure
[15:36] until the end the same shall be saved
[15:39] and another place here in the scripture
[15:41] in 2 Thessalonians 2:9 the Bible would
[15:44] read this wherein I suffer trouble as an
[15:46] evildoer even unto bonds but the word of
[15:49] God is not bound and therefore I Endure
[15:53] all things for for the elect's sake that
[15:56] they may also obtain the Salvation which
[15:59] is in Christ Jesus with eternal amen so
[16:03] there's many places as you read uh
[16:05] especially in the New Testament that you
[16:07] hear about enduring in many scriptures
[16:09] you could read about that another place
[16:11] Paul would say that I press toward the
[16:13] mark of the High Calling of Christ so uh
[16:16] you'll find it's almost a principal
[16:18] theme of the scripture that uh we're not
[16:21] in a picnic but we're in a battle and
[16:23] we're in a war and we're in a fight we
[16:25] can all agree that uh the Christian Life
[16:28] it's not just a flowery bed of ease but
[16:30] but every single person in here we had
[16:32] to fight to be here tonight we we did we
[16:35] didn't just get here because it was easy
[16:37] but we got here because we pressed out
[16:39] and came to the house of God and you'll
[16:41] find that the Christian Life that's
[16:43] going to it's always going to be a fight
[16:46] and it's always going to be a press and
[16:48] there's many tapes that you could turn
[16:50] to and find that brother brand would
[16:53] title a lot of sermons and talk about
[16:55] perseverance and talk about uh and end
[16:59] during and and things of that sort he
[17:00] would he would preach many sermons
[17:02] talking about being persevering and if
[17:04] you take that word being perseverant
[17:06] it's something that's in you that that
[17:08] there's just no give up on the inside of
[17:10] you that no matter what you face or no
[17:12] matter uh what you're coming against
[17:14] you're going to persevere and you're
[17:17] going to fight and keep on going and and
[17:19] you know brother Brandon would preach a
[17:20] lot of sermons with them specific titles
[17:23] and persevering and a lot of them slip
[17:26] me at the moment but I was just reading
[17:27] about uh the different sermon titles
[17:29] that the prophet would talk about and
[17:31] you come to find out that the Christian
[17:33] Life it is a life of
[17:35] War it's a life of fighting it's a life
[17:38] of uh uh struggling it's a life of
[17:40] pressing it's a life of enduring and you
[17:43] know it's amazing because we could take
[17:45] all of these words and describe our walk
[17:47] with the Lord and to The Outsider we
[17:50] would say well I'd never want to be a
[17:51] Christian then if there if you've got to
[17:53] fight you've got to endure you got to be
[17:55] perseverant you've got to be persistent
[17:58] you've got to to do all them things it
[18:00] sounds like a lot of hard work amen and
[18:02] to this flesh it would seem like a lot
[18:04] of hard work and you know I wish I could
[18:06] stand here as a gospel preacher in the
[18:09] end time and and prophesy and tell you
[18:11] that that your life is just going to be
[18:13] sunshine and rainbows and it's all going
[18:15] to be easy and it's all it's always just
[18:18] going to be a bunch of Flowery bed of
[18:20] EAS but I'm not able to do that because
[18:22] the Bible never tells us that our life
[18:25] is going to be just a flowery bed of
[18:27] ease or our life is going to be easy but
[18:30] see what the scripture did say is that
[18:32] I'll be with you I'll be even in you all
[18:36] the way until the end of the world so I
[18:39] can't stand here and preach to you and
[18:41] tell you that your life is always going
[18:44] to be easy but I can stand here with
[18:47] full assurity on God's word and tell you
[18:49] that God is a God that will never fail
[18:52] you and he's a God that will be with you
[18:55] even in you every single battle that you
[18:59] think you fight by yourself you're not
[19:01] fighting that thing alone but God is
[19:03] with you even in
[19:06] you it's exactly the truth we're we're
[19:09] not here to prophesy that everything's
[19:10] going to be easy but we can prophesy
[19:13] that God is on our side and that God
[19:16] will be with us and I think it's amazing
[19:18] how God does things and we can all agree
[19:20] on that because there in the book of
[19:23] Isaiah 558 the the prophet speaking
[19:26] there he would say my thoughts they're
[19:27] not your thoughts
[19:29] we can all agree on that my thoughts are
[19:31] not your thoughts and neither are my
[19:33] ways your ways amen how many's ever been
[19:36] there and say God I would have never
[19:37] done it this way or or I would have
[19:39] never thought it would have been this
[19:41] way of course you wouldn't because God's
[19:42] ways they are not your ways and God's
[19:45] thoughts they're not your thoughts amen
[19:47] and I'm glad I'm not God and I'm glad
[19:49] you're not God because you probably
[19:51] wouldn't have chose me and I probably
[19:53] wouldn't have chose you but see that
[19:55] comes down to the almighty election of
[19:58] God and it's election by for knowledge
[20:00] see amen God knew that there would be a
[20:03] germ seed of life on the inside of you
[20:06] and that's the reason he could choose
[20:08] you and elect you before the foundation
[20:11] of this world was ever laid because he
[20:14] knew there was a seed of representation
[20:17] on the inside of you amen amen and as
[20:20] the heavens are higher than the earth so
[20:22] are my ways higher than your ways and my
[20:24] thoughts than your thoughts we know that
[20:27] God does things in unique ways and God
[20:29] allows us to go through things he allows
[20:32] us to go through battles ain't it
[20:34] amazing that God has all powerful as he
[20:37] is and as Almighty he is and he created
[20:40] the whole earth that you and I live on
[20:43] and in your mind sometimes when you're
[20:44] in the heath of the battle and you're
[20:46] having to do what we're preaching about
[20:48] you're having to endure and then you
[20:50] just sit back and think a moment you
[20:52] know God in just one word he could speak
[20:55] this whole situation out of existence
[20:58] and he could speak this whole battle out
[21:00] of existence but see God did not do that
[21:03] and and here's the reason why because
[21:05] God he's more concerned about your
[21:08] character than he is your comfort God is
[21:11] not always worried hey are you
[21:13] comfortable are you is it easy are you
[21:16] okay The Way It Is God is not concerned
[21:18] about that because God wants you to be
[21:21] ready for a Rapture listen God is not
[21:24] concerned about us being a comfortable
[21:26] church but he's concerned about us being
[21:28] a church full of the character of Jesus
[21:32] Christ listen we're not here to be
[21:34] comfortable brother and sister we are
[21:36] here to have character fit to
[21:39] rule that's exactly the truth amen
[21:42] you'll find that God lets us go through
[21:44] things and God lets us uh uh go through
[21:47] humiliating battles and humiliating
[21:49] trials but see many times it takes
[21:52] humiliation in your life to bring amen a
[21:55] testimony out of it ain't that right
[21:57] many times you or not many times but
[22:00] every single time every time God has
[22:02] given you a test it's not to hurt you it
[22:05] is not to it ain't because God is mad at
[22:07] you and ain't because God how many's
[22:09] ever prayed for God to deliver you out
[22:10] of
[22:11] something just a couple people man I
[22:13] guess y'all don't battle a whole lot of
[22:15] stuff around Georgia I'm all the time
[22:17] saying God deliver me from this God
[22:19] deliver me from this we all brother not
[22:22] a single one of us in here likes going
[22:24] through trials and likes going through
[22:26] these things amen but see what you've
[22:28] got to realize is that you cannot have a
[22:31] testimony unless you have a test
[22:34] Hallelujah you am me you can't have a
[22:37] testimony that you can share with
[22:39] somebody unless you have went through
[22:42] something now listen you've got to learn
[22:44] to to Glory through the tribulation and
[22:47] Glory through the testing and know this
[22:49] brother sister that when God gets done
[22:51] trying you you're going to come forth as
[22:54] precious gold that is tried in the fire
[22:58] listen listen everything you're ever
[23:00] going to go through it is not because
[23:02] God is upset at you but it's because God
[23:05] is molding you and he's shaping you into
[23:08] the person that he wants you to be so
[23:11] don't you ever think that that God you
[23:13] must hate me to let me go through this
[23:16] no it's quite the opposite God loves you
[23:19] and and those that are sons of God they
[23:21] will be chastised of God and that's
[23:24] exactly right and a son can withstand
[23:26] chastisement amen amen that's exactly
[23:29] right a daughter can withstand
[23:31] chastisement because we're of God we can
[23:33] stand it amen let me tell you this God
[23:36] knows what you can stand even if you
[23:38] don't amen the Bible is clear on that
[23:41] that God will not tempt a man more that
[23:43] he can or he'll not allow you to have
[23:45] more battles or or more Temptation than
[23:47] what you're able to Bear amen sometimes
[23:50] it seem like you're getting all the way
[23:51] out real Lord are you are you sure that
[23:54] I can bear this but but see God knows
[23:57] something about you that that you're not
[23:58] even aware listen God knows that there
[24:01] is a seed on the inside of you brother
[24:03] and sister and you may not know it and
[24:06] the church may not know it but God knows
[24:09] those who that is own and he knows that
[24:12] the seed that's in you it will prevail
[24:15] 100% of the time listen this flesh May
[24:18] Fail and this Spirit May Fail but there
[24:21] is a seed Gene of God on the inside of
[24:24] you and it don't matter what the devil
[24:26] throws your way brother sister amen that
[24:29] that seed that's on the inside of you it
[24:31] will prevail every
[24:34] time that's exactly right it can endure
[24:36] it amen we're here to endure and and
[24:39] it's amazing because you see these
[24:41] things in the scripture that there can
[24:43] be so much bad and so much humiliation
[24:45] but somehow at the end of it all it's
[24:48] going to work together for your good and
[24:50] see what the devil wants you to do as
[24:53] the Church of the Living God is he
[24:55] always wants to point your eyes on
[24:57] what's not good right the pastor wants
[25:00] to point his eyes on uh the devil wants
[25:03] your pastor to point his eyes on the
[25:04] problems in the church the problems in
[25:06] this person he always wants your focus
[25:09] to be on issues a and problems and and
[25:13] well this is not good and that's not
[25:15] good and see he always wants your focus
[25:18] to be on that so he can keep you
[25:20] discouraged but see you have to always
[25:22] remind yourself what the Bible said God
[25:25] never said everything would be good but
[25:28] he did say it would work together for my
[25:31] good he never said it would be easy on
[25:34] me but he did say it would work together
[25:37] for my good and sometimes you're going
[25:40] through something as a young person and
[25:42] you're saying God why are you allowing
[25:43] this to happen to me and why are you
[25:46] allowing this battle and this struggle
[25:48] and this battle and I ask you to to
[25:51] deliver me out of the trial and I'm
[25:53] still in it and I ask you for this and
[25:55] I'm still in it see You' got to learn
[25:57] how to change that prayer a little bit
[26:00] because God sometimes he don't just say
[26:02] oh sure I'll just pull you out of the
[26:04] fire listen God never promised to pull
[26:06] you out of the fire but he did say I
[26:09] will be with you in the fire don't you
[26:12] realize if God wanted to he could pull
[26:14] you out of anything you're in right now
[26:17] but see God don't always work the way
[26:19] you want him to work it's because he
[26:21] wants there to be a testimony listen
[26:24] when you sing on Sunday morning God
[26:27] wants you to know what you're singing
[26:28] about when you lift your hands on Sunday
[26:31] morning God wants you to know what
[26:33] you're lifting your hands about listen
[26:35] there ain't a better praise in the lips
[26:38] of a person that's been through a battle
[26:40] and seen the mighty hand of God come
[26:43] down and deliver them out of it see
[26:45] that's why God allows you to go through
[26:48] something so you can say God I know you
[26:51] as healer I know you as deliverer I know
[26:54] you as Savior listen you've got to learn
[26:57] to to endure hardness you got to endure
[27:01] the difficulties because at the end of
[27:04] it God will get the glory out of
[27:07] it that's exactly right y'all all
[27:09] remember the man that was blind and they
[27:11] came to Jesus and asked him they said
[27:13] Jesus why was this man born blind was it
[27:16] was it because the his sins was it
[27:18] because the sin of his parents or was it
[27:21] because the the sin of his grandparents
[27:23] y'all y'all remember the the story in
[27:24] the scripture and Jesus said it wasn't
[27:27] because he was a sinner it wasn't
[27:29] because he did anything wrong I want you
[27:31] to hear me it wasn't because he did
[27:33] anything wrong or his parents did
[27:35] anything wrong but the reason this man
[27:38] was born blind was that the glory of God
[27:42] could be made manifest through this
[27:44] person he said preacher why am I going
[27:46] through what I'm going through was it
[27:48] because of something I did was it
[27:50] because of something my parents did it
[27:52] may not be any of that but it could be
[27:55] but see it could be that God he just
[27:57] wants to get Glory out of your life he
[28:00] wants to use you as an example to show
[28:03] you that God can still deliver them that
[28:06] are oppressed and God can deliver them
[28:09] that are bound and sometimes you get so
[28:12] caught up why am I in this why am I
[28:14] going through this but you've got to
[28:16] realize God I don't know how but you're
[28:19] going to get the glory out of this
[28:21] situation God why is this happening
[28:24] maybe because God wants to get the glory
[28:27] out of the situ you're going
[28:30] through praise the Lord amen everything
[28:33] will work together for the good to them
[28:36] that love God and the prophet talks
[28:37] about it in the message I know because
[28:40] he says we ask God for comfort and peace
[28:42] how many's ever asked for that we ask
[28:44] God for comfort and peace and I want you
[28:46] to listen because the prophet says and
[28:47] God gives us the best that he
[28:50] could what's the best with the song how
[28:52] he wants to know what the best he could
[28:53] give you trials and tribulations
[28:58] amen what yeah the best God could get we
[29:02] ask for comfort and peace and God gives
[29:05] us did you read that right I read it
[29:06] right I'll give you the quote later
[29:08] trials and
[29:09] tribulations that's the best thing God
[29:12] could give you listen my sister I don't
[29:15] know if you realize but this flesh is
[29:17] sorry this flesh don't want to worship
[29:19] God this flesh don't want to come to
[29:21] church this flesh brother it likes the
[29:24] easy way it likes the comfortable it
[29:26] likes the church to be seven Dees
[29:29] precisely or we're going to be all upset
[29:31] and his flesh likes it to be just a
[29:33] specific and perfect way and the
[29:36] prophet's saying here he said we ask God
[29:38] for comfort and peace and God gives us
[29:40] the best he could give us he gives us
[29:43] trials and tribulations he says and
[29:45] that's better than comfort and peace he
[29:47] said see our comfort is just beyond the
[29:50] river so the prophet's taking your
[29:53] comfort and saying if you want to be
[29:54] comfortable this ain't no place for it
[29:56] if you want to be relaxed this is not
[29:58] the place for it he said our comfort
[30:01] amen our us being comfortable is just be
[30:04] on the river listen Church let's not get
[30:07] stagnant and comfortable in the house of
[30:10] God but let's realize hey we're not here
[30:12] to be comfortable we're in a war and
[30:15] we're in a battle and we got to fight
[30:18] we've got to fight for everything we've
[30:20] got we're not here just for just for I
[30:23] am a comfort and easy going and Easy
[30:26] Living see that's what this L to seeing
[30:28] lukewarm has got a bunch of Easy Living
[30:31] and see the devil wants to push the same
[30:34] thing upon the church and say just take
[30:36] it easy you know just do your religious
[30:39] Duty on Sunday morning you and you'll be
[30:41] fine you you just come on you you
[30:43] realize the devil's okay with you being
[30:45] in
[30:46] church he comes to church every service
[30:49] he comes to church more than some folks
[30:51] do the devil's okay with you coming to
[30:53] the house of God but as long as he can
[30:56] keep you comfortable and relax and
[30:58] you're just sitting there and you're
[31:00] hearing the song leader sing and you're
[31:02] hearing the preacher preach A good
[31:04] sermon amen see the devil is fine with
[31:07] that but see you've got to you got to
[31:09] get a little bit of grit about you
[31:11] sometimes and say I'm not here to be
[31:13] comfortable but I'm here to endure and
[31:16] I'm here to fight through amen just this
[31:19] comfortable Easy Living that the devil's
[31:22] trying to bring listen brother sister
[31:24] you got to press through this flesh Amen
[31:27] to really enter into worship and to
[31:30] enter into a service you got to press
[31:32] Beyond this flesh that's exactly what
[31:35] Christ taught Amen to the woman at the
[31:37] well he said listen the hour is coming
[31:39] that them that worship me will worship
[31:41] me in spirit and in Truth Listen brother
[31:44] sister a true service where God is
[31:46] moving and blessing you is when you
[31:49] break out of being comfortable and you
[31:52] break out of just being
[31:54] stagnant that's exactly right amen
[31:57] Abraham the Bible he was humiliated and
[31:59] he had to endure amen could you imagine
[32:02] praying for something and believing for
[32:03] something for 25 something years I don't
[32:06] know about you all but sometimes I pray
[32:07] about it two times and just forget about
[32:09] it but see Abraham wasn't that way
[32:11] Abraham he prayed and prayed and
[32:13] believed and believed and brother for
[32:16] years and years and years he knew by the
[32:18] way that God made him a promise Abraham
[32:21] through your loins I'm going to give you
[32:23] a son I I I I'm going to I'm I'm going
[32:25] to bring a great Victory through you and
[32:28] Abraham is here with a promise of God
[32:30] and what does he have to do with that
[32:32] promise brother and sister he has to
[32:33] endure with it amen he has to endure see
[32:37] he got his testimony right and he said
[32:39] glory to God God's going to give us a
[32:41] Child G glory to God Sarah's going to
[32:43] get pregnant glory to God and see the
[32:46] prophet said something very beautiful
[32:47] about Abraham because he went ahead and
[32:49] testified of it before he even saw any
[32:54] evidence Oh Glory before he even saw any
[32:58] evidence before she actually conceived
[33:01] Abraham was already testifying of what
[33:04] God was going to do and he had to bear
[33:08] that reproach of me he had to endure
[33:10] people saying Abraham you you're just
[33:13] you don't have a child Abra Abraham
[33:16] listen you're old and she's old and
[33:19] Abraham brother he he he just he kept
[33:21] his head down and he endured he said I
[33:23] don't care what you say I don't care
[33:26] what you say I'm going to endure until I
[33:29] see the Promise made manifest amen see
[33:33] he didn't give up on God's promises and
[33:36] listen I believe I'm looking at Sons and
[33:38] Daughters of Abraham here this evening
[33:40] and listen you may have prayed one time
[33:43] I think it's time you pray again you may
[33:45] have prayed for years and years I think
[33:47] it's time that you pray again and you
[33:50] endure and say listen if it ain't
[33:52] tomorrow I'm looking for it the next
[33:56] day hey if God didn't give up on us why
[33:59] should we give up on his
[34:01] word amen God gave us his promise but he
[34:05] sometimes you got to endure see the
[34:07] scripture says though the vision tar do
[34:09] what wait for it though The Vision T
[34:11] though it seems like God is lingering
[34:13] sometimes you got to wait for it a
[34:15] little bit amen let me tell you you keep
[34:17] on praying for deliverance you keep on
[34:19] praying for the victory amen and I'll
[34:21] tell you eventually brother and sister
[34:23] it may not be tomorrow it may not be
[34:26] next week but Victory will come amen
[34:29] Deliverance will come but no matter what
[34:31] your need is it will come as long as you
[34:35] Ure the hardness as long as you endure
[34:38] the suffering and say God I know the
[34:41] mountain ain't moving but I'm believing
[34:43] that the mountain will move amen amen
[34:47] see that's got to be our attitude we've
[34:49] got to constantly endure and fight
[34:51] endure and fight amen Paul amen he he
[34:54] was a man that had to endure he was a
[34:56] man that had to get everything that he
[34:58] knew he was a man that was willing to be
[35:00] humiliated he was a man that was willing
[35:03] to be amen uh below amen lowered down
[35:05] compared to where he was and he said
[35:07] there in the scripture he said yay
[35:09] Dallas I count all things as lost except
[35:12] for the Excellency of the knowledge of
[35:14] Christ Jesus my Lord my my amen the
[35:17] humiliation then God brings it and
[35:20] brings a testimony and brings
[35:22] glorification out of it see brother
[35:24] sister we just have to we've got to
[35:26] learn sometimes to endure the battle and
[35:29] endure the trial endure whatever you're
[35:32] going through sometimes you've just got
[35:34] to you've got to be ready to ride out
[35:36] the storm listen I wish I could tell you
[35:38] that God will deliver you out of it but
[35:40] I can't do that brother sister but I'll
[35:42] tell you about a God that will never
[35:44] leave you he'll never forsake you all
[35:47] you've got to do is call on him when
[35:50] you're in the middle of the situation we
[35:52] serve a God that you can call on him and
[35:55] say God I I need your strength Str to
[35:58] carry on he is a present help in a time
[36:01] of trouble listen he may not just amen
[36:04] do a miracle and deliver you immediately
[36:07] out of it but I'm telling you God can
[36:09] give you the strength you need to go
[36:11] through
[36:13] something that's exactly right amen
[36:16] there's many places we could go but for
[36:18] the sake of time I'm not going to go in
[36:19] many areas in this but amen it was
[36:22] Daniel and the Lion's Den it was the
[36:24] three Hebrew children they endured all
[36:26] the way up until the end
[36:28] he man ain't it so powerful how God does
[36:30] things that he'll let things brother in
[36:32] your life he'll let them get so bad
[36:35] he'll let things get so horrible that
[36:38] you'll literally be me being thrown into
[36:41] the fiery furnace and you're thinking
[36:43] where is God right now where where where
[36:46] is the Lord where is his presence where
[36:48] is deliverance and see sometimes God
[36:50] will let you endure all the way to the
[36:54] very end of the road and then you'll
[36:56] find the force man in the fire
[36:59] hallelujah amen sometimes you'll be all
[37:01] the way into the lion's den and you say
[37:04] devil I'm not going to Bow I'm not going
[37:07] to stop serving God and you'll be all
[37:09] the way into the worst Battle of your
[37:12] life and then you'll find the glory of
[37:15] God and you'll find the presence of God
[37:17] but see listen amen the three Hebrew
[37:20] children would have never saw the fourth
[37:21] man if they did not endure through the
[37:25] battle amen Abraham would have never saw
[37:28] his Isaac unless he endured through the
[37:31] battle and listen you won't ever see
[37:33] your Victory unless you endure through
[37:36] the battle I say church it's time that
[37:39] let let's just hold steady and endure
[37:42] and we'll see the glory of God we'll see
[37:45] the blessings of God we'll see the
[37:48] testimony from
[37:50] God how would we see it unless we
[37:53] endure Hallelujah the prophet talks
[37:55] about in that same quote he said it was
[37:57] until the Hebrew CH was forced into the
[37:59] fiery fer or a fiery furnace that one of
[38:02] them that he said they was in their most
[38:04] outstanding trial that they seen one
[38:06] like unto the son of man he said their
[38:08] troubles I want you to listen to this
[38:10] their troubles produce the Son of
[38:13] God their troubles produced the son of
[38:16] God standing among them and he was there
[38:19] to breee and to wave away the heat wave
[38:23] he said but it was not until they went
[38:26] into the fire
[38:28] that the comforter did appear amen and
[38:31] sometimes brother and sister you're in
[38:33] the middle of the fire but sometimes
[38:36] it's because that's when that God wants
[38:38] to reveal himself to you listen how
[38:41] could you know him as a comforter unless
[38:44] you ever received a big disturbance in
[38:46] your life or turmoil how could you know
[38:49] God is a savior unless You' been loost
[38:51] listen you'll come to find out that God
[38:54] knows what he's doing and he know what
[38:57] you can handle and he know what you
[38:59] can't handle listen he may give you one
[39:01] battle and he may give me one battle and
[39:04] you may have it way worse than I have it
[39:06] or I may have it way worse than you have
[39:07] it but no matter what God knows what
[39:10] he's
[39:12] doing but it's up to us to endure it see
[39:15] the scripture says in 2 Corinthians 4:17
[39:18] I love what Paul I I I just like a man
[39:20] of of courage and git like this he said
[39:23] our light
[39:25] Affliction you ever in the middle of a
[39:27] battle you say it's light Affliction no
[39:31] our light Affliction which is but one
[39:33] honest man right here our light
[39:35] Affliction is but for a moment our light
[39:38] Affliction now listen you're talking
[39:40] about a man that's been Shipwrecked a
[39:42] man that's been locked in prison amen a
[39:44] man that has been laughed at and scorned
[39:47] at and Paul is right here I've been
[39:49] Shipwrecked and this has happened I've
[39:51] been put in prison and this has happened
[39:53] and this has happened and Paul says
[39:55] listen our lot affliction
[39:58] which is just for a moment worketh for
[40:00] us a far more exceeding and eternal
[40:04] weight of glory amen listen next time
[40:06] you're in a real bad battle I want you
[40:08] to remember this scripture this is a
[40:10] light
[40:11] Affliction Hallelujah this is a light
[40:14] Affliction whenever you're really going
[40:16] through something amen I love what Paul
[40:18] does because amen normally we like to
[40:21] cater to the flesh somebody says how you
[40:23] doing brother you just don't even know
[40:26] you don't know how bad I've got it and
[40:29] sometimes you wish you just didn't even
[40:31] ask you say sister how you
[40:34] doing you just don't know what I've been
[40:36] through at school and you just don't
[40:37] know the the trials and the troubles and
[40:39] this and this see Paul wasn't a man like
[40:42] that amen Paul had been through a lot of
[40:44] battles but you never even heard about
[40:46] me amen am me a lot of the worst battles
[40:49] he been through we probably never even
[40:50] heard about and Paul is never
[40:52] complaining and he's never being grumpy
[40:55] about it he says all lot affliction
[40:57] which is just for a moment it's working
[41:00] for us a far more exceeding and eternal
[41:04] weight and glory amen I just love what
[41:06] he does here brother Rob because he
[41:08] takes away all excuses and he don't
[41:11] cater to your flesh because when we get
[41:13] down and we get low we want a pat on the
[41:15] back listen it's going to be okay you
[41:18] you you just hang on for a while but
[41:20] Paul ain't doing that Paul said listen
[41:22] you're in a light Affliction and this
[41:24] light Affliction is just for a moment
[41:27] and it's not going to stay this way amen
[41:30] I need you to help me preach just for a
[41:31] moment now amen tell the person beside
[41:34] you it's a light
[41:37] Affliction it's a light Affliction the
[41:40] person beside you it's a light
[41:41] Affliction but what about this amen how
[41:44] many's ever been Shipwrecked raise your
[41:46] hand
[41:48] wow how many's ever been well I want to
[41:50] ask that maybe we got some good
[41:53] testimonies in here KN that I want to
[41:56] ask you you've been to prison and if you
[41:57] have him praise the Lord for taking you
[42:00] out of there also amen but we could all
[42:03] compare our battles and compare our Tri
[42:05] with what Paul had went through and we
[42:07] could look at all of these Avenues but
[42:09] see amen Paul never catered to that he
[42:12] said we're in line Affliction amen
[42:14] listen Paul learned one thing he said he
[42:17] learned one thing no matter what I'm
[42:18] going through I've got to learn to
[42:20] endure it amen I've got to learn to
[42:22] endure what I'm facing amen I want to
[42:25] encourage you here today no matter what
[42:27] you're going through I want you to
[42:28] remember you've got to endure it amen
[42:31] you've got to endure whatever the battle
[42:33] is amen it's amazing because you read
[42:36] there in the Old Testament you find uh
[42:38] Joseph we know the prophet talked a lot
[42:40] of things about Joseph he was a perfect
[42:41] type of Christ except the one scratch he
[42:43] had on him and Joseph he's such a a
[42:46] beautiful testimony of all things
[42:48] working together for the good because
[42:50] this is a man brother sister amen he had
[42:52] been through so many troubles he had
[42:54] done and he he's not living a
[42:56] backsliding life life he's not doing the
[42:58] wrong thing but he's going to prison and
[43:01] he amen he runs away from pifer's wife
[43:03] and gets thrown into the prison again
[43:05] and he's made a slave in the land of
[43:06] Egypt amen and and he would go up and
[43:09] down and up and down and Joseph would
[43:12] fight so many battles and then at the
[43:14] end of her brother sister he's all the
[43:16] way to a position of
[43:19] authority he's in a powerful position
[43:22] and his brothers come to him and he ask
[43:24] him does my father live and then he
[43:26] asked him we we all know the story in
[43:28] the Bible and then they go back and go
[43:29] get Benjamin and so forth and then
[43:31] Joseph comes and he goes to reveal
[43:34] himself to his Brethren and then he he
[43:37] begins to reveal and says I'm Joseph
[43:39] your brother and then they got so afraid
[43:42] and so scared and I love what but I I
[43:45] love what Joseph said in the Bible he
[43:47] said don't be angry with yourselves
[43:49] don't be upset with yourselves because
[43:52] God did this to preserve life amen look
[43:56] at the the the character that was so
[43:58] molded in the Joseph you realize young
[44:01] people amen Joseph could to said listen
[44:03] you look at how look at how great I am
[44:06] and you're coming to me for him now look
[44:07] who's the tough guy but see he had been
[44:10] through so many trials and troubles that
[44:14] there was such a character that was
[44:16] molded into him that when the
[44:18] opportunity to portray Christ arose he
[44:22] did not portray Joseph because all of
[44:24] Joseph had been squeezed and molded out
[44:27] of him but he said don't be mad at
[44:29] yourselves don't don't be upset at
[44:31] yourselves but God did this to preserve
[44:36] life amen so when you're in a trial you
[44:39] got to look yourself in the mirror and
[44:40] say who did this God did this hallelujah
[44:44] amen when you're going through one of
[44:46] the worst storms of life you got to look
[44:48] in the mirror and say God did this to me
[44:51] amen it was God that did this it was God
[44:53] that allowed this God the same God that
[44:56] stopped the son he he could have stopped
[44:58] this but he didn't do it don't be angry
[45:01] and don't be upset because God did this
[45:05] hallelujah amen listen you you study and
[45:08] you find out that Joseph was a slave for
[45:10] actually about 13
[45:12] years he was in prison or in the land of
[45:15] Egypt as a slave for 13 years and I
[45:17] think it's amazing because sometimes
[45:18] there ain't a way around
[45:20] that sometimes there ain't a way to
[45:23] avoid them 13 years sometimes you've got
[45:25] to go through the 13 years of testing
[45:28] and trial and testing and TR yeah and
[45:31] you think I thought you was trying to
[45:32] encourage us I am very much listen my
[45:35] sister the only way you could be where
[45:37] Joseph was amen people are F say look at
[45:40] Joseph and look how he's such an
[45:42] overcomer and he's such a blessing to
[45:45] the church and he's this and he's this
[45:48] but you don't know what it took you
[45:50] don't know what it took to get Joseph
[45:53] from being a boy that was sold by his
[45:55] brothers in a pit all the way Amen to
[45:59] the right hand of pharaoh what did it
[46:02] take it took a man enduring it took a
[46:04] man that was persistent and persevering
[46:07] he would lay in the prison and say God
[46:09] I'm not giving up God I'm not going to
[46:12] stop God I'm not giving up Do You
[46:14] Realize Joseph could have went and begin
[46:16] to serve the gods that were down in
[46:18] Egypt but he did not do it amen he
[46:21] remained his heart on God and he said
[46:24] God if I'm in the prison I'm still a
[46:26] Christian if I'm in the schoolhouse I'm
[46:29] still a Christian I'm going to endure
[46:32] hardness I'm going to endure pure
[46:34] pressure I'm going to endure the
[46:37] schoolhouse and keep my testimony

[46:44] people like Joseph listen let me tell

[46:58] schoolhouse no matter where you put
