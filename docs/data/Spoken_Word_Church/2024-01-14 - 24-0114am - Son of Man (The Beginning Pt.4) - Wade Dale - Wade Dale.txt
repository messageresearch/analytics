Wednesday night if you are are widowed uh there's deer meat down in the freezer that Lord was gracious enough to give me four deer this year so so some of the deer Meats downstairs in the freezer for those of you that are single and if you are finished and don't need anym then we'll let everybody else um take it if they you look at that little package that says hot that sausage believe you me it's hot so if you like really hot sausage take it home with you cuz I mistakenly got too many hot so if you mix it with a mild it's not too bad but I think there's one in one of those down there but just

able for you to enjoy it if you need some some good uh nutritional meat so let's go to the Lord in prayer we're going to we're still on the son of man but we're on the beginning part again um we're going to probably next Sunday start on the church ages so if you want to read the church age book we're going to fly through it really quick uh we've been through it a hundred times but we've got to connect it with the seals because the seals and the church ages are connected together so we sure do appreciate the Lord for helping us to u to try to begin on that but let's start with this as we as we uh begin the beginning part four dear heavenly father thank you for this day Lord thank you for the word you give us thank you for all the songs and all the worship Lord and the fellowship Lord now I pray that we'll settle down and listen to you for a few minutes Lord just teach us Lord to to wait on you father and and be patient and and good things will come father I pray Lord that as a church family Lord that good things will come this year if we'll bind oursel together Lord and just not let the devil come between any of us and and sickness come between us and Lord we pray that you'd restore everyone to health the the tribs and different ones Lord that we know that called and said they wouldn't be here today CU they're all sick we see that sickness going through uh different uh whole families Lord I pray that you just rebuke that thing today in name of the Lord as the word Goes Forth as you said you healed the people thank you for helping Brother Anderson and his family Lord and get them through all that Lord immune system will be built up and Lord you put all that in place you knew we' need this but you knew that we'd need prayer so father I pray that you'd be with us and bless us now in Jesus name amen John 1 verse one in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God as we were talking about Wednesday night we'll background a little bit on that all things were made by him whoever this person is now we're talking about man' whoever this person is he's he has made everything all right he even made the devil but he didn't make the devil the devil that's right he made him lufer he made him the anointed cherub and then the Cherub made a choice all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made then verse 14 God thought so much of that word he put it down in flesh and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you can be seated in the Lord has his Blessing to the reading of the word Colossians 1:12 says we were um if you weren't here W tonight we'll give you a little bit of a background here uh we were covering something because if we see that it's a paradox we must see that we're called out of the age that our that our soul is in Heavenly places as we were talking about in another dimension because it's Eternal and but it's it's caught or encapsulated in in this body that we're living in it doesn't migrate or it doesn't move move or it doesn't I breathe my soul out into brother Michael and he breathes his back to me no you're an individual and a person and we'll get to that God thought so much of that he made it so individual he made it so individual that you are you're everything you do you're an individual all right and as we're going to read here before you can't blame it on your mama your daddy your brother your sister you are going to stand before the white drone judgment if you do not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul you will stand there by yourself not as a family right all right and you can't stand there and say well my daddy made it so why didn't I no your daddy made it because and you didn't make it because so you can fill all that in all right so we got to have our own personal experience with God that's right everybody with me on that you got to have that and you got to have the same thing with these virtues these virtues don't cover families right no individuals always an individual giving thanks unto the Father which has made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints and Light Watch how Paul articulates this who hath delivered us from the power of Darkness all right he's took us from somewhere and ha translated us into the kingdom of his dear son now what's translate that's transpose or transfer or remove from one place to another we've been removed from the supposed to power of evil amen that's in our soul and we are but we still have a spirit to deal with all right it has not been translated it was something we got when we got here it was a nature that we have to fight but if you're born again today you have been translated into the kingdom and you got a place in the city City's already being built and it's being built in you all right we'll get to that maybe a little bit this afternoon where John saw the city and it looked like a bride the bride looked like a city but he's translated us into the kingdom of his dear son to transpose transfer or move from one place to another change of situation or place in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins now look who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature now we were talking before and we're going to read it again where in this age is the beginning of the creation of God it's when the son of man is to be revealed so much to where we look back and see that the real you didn't do it amen all right remember justification ification baptism the Holy Ghost and brother Brown s justification you did it but you've been forgiven it's as if you never done it right and then you're going to realize the real you didn't do it to begin with all right and quit holding on to all this baggage from the Past come on somebody that's our problem the baggage from the past and it bothers us but we should not let it bother us we should cast what the Bible says cast down reasoning cast down all that get rid of our emotion that that well well I I I I I I got these feelings about this and feeling God didn't ask you did you feel it he said did you believe it all right he never said anything about feelings what about a son of man you're talking about somebody that he's a prince of peace and and the great uh everybody goes well Jesus is so loving and caring and and I just want to be that way well guess what he did they killed him for what he said right and it was the absolute truth yes sir it wasn't a lie it was a truth that's what they killed him for so guess what same way they'll do me and you they'll kill us or kill our influence one of the two so who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature now he's the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature so somewhere we're going to see this image of this God unfold and remember you're going to see where God says You' never seen me at any time but the the son has declared the father all right just like we were reading there all right for by him were all things created that heaven Earth visible invisible Thrones dominions principalities all things were created by Him before him and he is before all things now watch how Paul Paul is bringing this from Heaven to Earth yes and he is before all things and before him all thing and by him all things consist and he's the head of the body the church is not in heaven the church is here and he is the head of the body of the church who was the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell now see you can't say that about Adam Adam was not born he wasn't born again he didn't have a choice God gave him eternal life because he was the first man he was going to be the first example of man on Earth that was going to live and be Eternal but we know what happened he sold us out and then God had to take all that away from him amen he took all that away from Adam didn't take eternal life away from him but he took him the ability for him to live eternally in his body so then Adam 900 years later he had to die all right sin curse finally got him after 900 years Genesis 2:7 said the Lord God formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground and breathed through his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living soul and we were talking about this in the Bible study and and some on Wednesday night let's just remember for one thing I brother Brown I'm going prove it and brother Dale has preached it many many years that Adam was Adam was formed Out of the Dust of the ground his body was but remember his soul was that theophany that that was Genesis 1 126 that could rule and Reign and and you know uh the the wind would move and he'd say stop or this mountain would move and he'd say all right I need it over that way he was the architect of the Earth in his Spirit form right amen all right but when he put that into the two seven man God gave him a breath of life just like a baby born now we proved that the other day he didn't come here with eternal life in him there's only one person that did that and that was Jesus Christ when that baby breathed on whatever it was it wasn't Christmas day but in in April sometime when Jesus was born that was the Breath of God all right you and I are born by the Breath of God after the new birth but we're born by just regular natural breath that God gives us when we're born here naturally into this world everybody with me then Jesus said to them peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so I send you and when he had said this he breathed on them and said unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost now remember he did not they did not receive it at that moment right that was a promise the prophet of God tells us I didn't read the quote save time brother Brown said that was a promise and it was a promise cuz where was the Holy Ghost at that time it was sealed up inside of that man called Jesus Christ that's right all right and being sealed up inside of that man Jesus Christ until he left because he promised him he said I'll come back which is the Holy Ghost which is the comforter which is me I'm going to send back and he did that on the Pentecost so they couldn't receive it right then because Jesus had not left to send it back because in other words if he has breathed on them and he'd been standing on the earth and then his body his church body had started right then they'd have two bodies on the earth at the same time right everybody with me don't get quiet so Jesus had to go away it's expedient that I go away so that I can build a body down here Flesh of My Flesh bone of my bone that's what we're heading to am that's what the seals are going to do it's going to head us toward the our body change where no one else has been able to do that and it's not just going to be a happening it's not just going to be a day on the calendar it's not just going to be something that uh that God just cocked it up one day and said I'm tired of this we just going to have a a day right here in on November the 24th of 2024 I'm going to change everybody's body no that's not the way it is you're being changed right now you're being changed right now if you're not being changed right now if you're not changed from what you were you need the Holy Ghost cuz the Holy Ghost will change you whosoever sins you remit they are remitted and whosoever sins you retain they are retained see I want Power you you get when you receive the Holy Ghost all right Blasphemous names brother Brown talks about the church is a mystical Body of Christ born of the Breath of God now not as the baby you got to take the baby out because they were already on the day of Pentecost they probably were in their what 20s 30s 40s some of them in their 50 year old they've been breathing natural breath for a long time but all of a sudden God breathes into them especially into them just like especially into Adam he breathed the breath of eternal life life and they became an eternal person with God yes now that's what happened to you if you're born again God breathed the breath of eternal life not regular breath eternal life into you and you became a living Soul yes cuz we were dead before right the Bible tells us many many times we were dead in TR trespassing sin we were brother we were on our way to hell we were on our way down now we turn around we're on our way up so born of the Breath of God oh did you get that the Church of God is born of the Breath of God God breathed breath into the nostrils look spiritually of Adam not natural Adam was already breathing natural that's why he separated that we'll see in a minute where he says not what nature gave you nature gives you breath listen when a when a dog is born God don't give him a soul but he sure gives him breath and he breathes all through his life that's right right so they're a living being but they're not a living individual being they're born of nature right we know that but spiritually he breathed the Breath of Life spiritually of Adam and he became a living Soul there's many there's a Doctrine one time a long time ago brother Dale was telling us about it that that without the new birth you're not a living Soul no you're a living Soul when you're born no now it says here become a living so what do that mean that means that you were what the Bible says you're dead while you're living you can breathe really good natural good breath and be dead as a hammer dead in trespassing sin dead to to God but when you become what spiritually breathed upon and spiritually you become a son and daughter of God yes what does that do you become a living Soul your soul is then Eternal right right has new thoughts new process said did you know the Pentecostals of the true Pentecostal church is born of the Breath of God now what is that I hope my battery's not running low I thought I plugged it in I'll plug it in in a minute if I have to now so let's look and see what that breath is the brother brandom talks about logos and I just found a definition online and it's the same things what he says it's it's when you start speaking it's the speech it's the Talking part all right because we couldn't understand God how can we understand somebody again that that we never saw he had no place to put himself that's right right till he started creating well it was all formulated in his mind from the beginning to the end yes sir amen from the beginning to the end it was all now how you going to understand that guy you can't but the part we need to understand is all that Redemptive blessing that we're in under now that's what we need to understand about God because listen there'll be more for us to understand about God when we get there amen and there's more for us to understand now till we get there all right so we did not get it all at one time but God's got it all yes sir but how you going to understand that person that logos or that logic or that logo how you going to figure that out he's got to step forward and start talking as we said Wednesday night you can get a good sermon you can have a good testimony and you can walk up here and not say a word for 45 minutes and you got it up here brother John it's formulating that sermon is formulating in your head but until you speak it until you logos until you let it out amen it does nobody good so it wasn't going to do anybody any good for God to just stand there by himself because he had attributes he had feelings emotions yes God did amen and he had a a mouth he had speech and remember when he speaks he can't say I'm sorry I didn't mean to say that no now that we can't comprehend cuz how many times have we even this morning thought of something like I no I don't think I don't want to do that or not I don't think I want to do that so so this logos is brother BR I'm going to explain here in just a minute it look it's logical connection between an idea now look it includes faction statistics to me the faction statistics that did go that did go out the faction sta iscs that we are under is your Bible that you got in your hand that's a fact and it gives you statistics how that David slew Goliath boo devil I had this thing plugged in anyway so we can start with it anyway we get it started all right so we have a we have a place though that where God can we can understand that even a man that can that didn't exist didn't need anything to exist by is there so then that person that person then by the logos you have to have something to look at so there was a theophany that was made that Genesis 126 man was a theophany of God right because theophany is two words theophan which is God being manifested or the manif visible manifestation of a deity that's why talking when brother Aaron was talking about us coming together I mean look I if you get around bride that's the manifestation of deity but that world out there is not the manifestation of deity now it might have a deity but it's the deity of the devil not the deity of God Amen something they worship out there so we know where God is and we know God has given us a soul which is our theophan is brother R says cuz it's there with us that's what's going to be judged you your soul you but God had to become a theophany first so he could stand down and say Let There Be and then during the Old Testament he could walk in the cool of the day and talk to Adam so he had a body had a mouth ears and all the different things Parts because that's what Adam had that's right and we were made in His image all right and the commentator said ites it doesn't it doesn't show up in scripture but we by the Revelation that we have even of the end time we can look back and see that how God appeared as the angel of the Covenant he appeared as the captain of the host he appeared to Moses as we'll read it here in a few minutes he appeared to Abraham in theophany with a body of around it but that wasn't Jesus that was prefigure Jesus that was the theophany of God which was Jesus when he got a body down here all right there by with me why did Jesus need a body cuz you got one I was talking to brother Isaac yesterday or yeah last night he was talking about change of the body I said well that's where the seals has got to the seals has to show us the seals has to break we'll see where brother R tells us without the seals being broke you're not going to understand full Redemption that's right cuz the Seal of full Redemption not the twi horse rider was the Antichrist that is a revelation and that does get you started but it says brother Donaldo said Matthew 24:24 there's them two Spirits that's what you and I got discern and remember it was in in brother brandom and he said there it goes oh that's hard for people to get but he said here stands the Lamb with a book in his hand there goes a wild hor Rider if you read back and we'll get into it later on on uh in the maybe next week brother rown says I made a horrible mistake so what mistake was God going to make one come on was God going to make a mistake was God going to make his word wrong but brother renom did read the mighty conqueror 1959 he reads Revelation 6 and calls that the white horse rider with a man standing on sitting on it it's Christ but not when the Seal's broke that's right when the seals broke it tore apart and divided that Matthew 24:24 and we'll read it later on with the two Spirits what did Jesus stand up and say beware of false Devils no he didn't say that he said Beware of false Christ Christ's anointed ones separate them brother B says even in the church age book we'll read it later on where brother Bown says he said when we get a true revelation of the two spirits in the framework of this church I pointed to me and you like someone was speaking the other day said God what was he when he was back under millions and millions of years ago he was just like this space and then he gathered it up into the lost where we can understand he's going to talk then he came from the Lost down into Christ which is the anointed one or the Lo or the theophany it's God coming down like this to the Earth and then going right back in to God again don't you see what I mean just revolving coming down from space eternity rolling together coming down to Loos logos down of the man then return right back again for one purpose what to redeem that man that had fallen so he did all this for me and you now that's what he came for to be a redeemer and before God could be a redeemer he had to be according to the law K to us so he had to be born a baby cuz that's what me and you are we're born a baby right all right now there's different things you're talking about brother Bown now he says but God put a soul into man I want us to understand this that soul is the most important thing we can groom it lose it dress it and your soul be just as black absolutely amen as night but God put a soul in a man now watch this this white cloud deity came down not in the animal in the man all right he's talking about Adam cuz then here's this man and now the man sinned all right now look Adam didn't sin in his soul he s in his Spirit if you're born again today you have Sins Not in your soul but in your spirit everybody with me see how Adam and us it's got to be the same EX except you couldn't take Adam as your Redeemer because he's not kfol to you in the listen in the evolution I say create not Creative Evolution but God's Evolution Adam was the first man but like we said before you can uh you can go back and search all you want to we came from three people ham sham or jath we come from one of them three cuz no one never had another kid we came from them three and the whole world was populated for three men and three women the ones that were married to okay so we all came from that and it was all mixed up and gomed up and and there's no way you can find your true origin except I just put my faith in God that he knew where I was at before I got here right and he knows where I'm going after I get here and he made a place for me to go to you ought to be satisfied with that man does not know where they're going now got an election coming up got this one over here we got Trump and we got this one and we got that one and we they're already calling him the Antichrist and they just don't know what the Antichrist is that's right they're living in that system now yes sir the Antichrist system is Antichrist yes so it's a father son Holy Ghost baptism Christ no it's Antichrist that's why brother R had to come back that's why the word had to come back into Power where God could use us again cuz things in the word is that man tore the pages out oh we don't have to do that our denomination says this n said we're going to do this the nickolath and spirit which that's what we're going to cover in the church ages you're going to see you're going to see that God now now listen God now we look at him we see where brother BR he he goes back and he says here stands the lamb and there goes he see separation yes right all of it separating yes all right well now what he's saiding is is down when they got NAA they were going to try to join it all back together or join it together to them you go talk to a real good Baptist Methodist and you go through all their major doctrines right it's the same as the Catholic Church except for communion and brother brandham said that somewhere they'll compromise on that to get into that World Council of churches they're uniting oh yeah they're uniting we are too but we're United time and sign to the bride to our what to our husband now they have a husband too and when he ascended and fell let's get back to Adam then that little cloud in there now look God didn't do away with a little Cloud right it just became marred in Black the flu got stopped up Adam started using in something he never had before and that was a carnal mind that would allow him to lust come we might get to it today we may not we'll get to it this afternoon for sure brother R talks about babies and why they all go to heaven when they're young cuz they have no sin I'll read it to you he said they have no sin he said you can't have sin and go to heaven right he said but one time when a person comes or a kid or whoever you are comes to the age of accountability to know that's wrong watch out then you become accountable then you become brother R talks about recording Angels recording what you done but before that look at how innocent you're born in you think well that baby was born from from um a prostitute and and um you know whatever more well it doesn't matter right okay hang out on your mom and daddy you and God same way with Adam he didn't get he he gave adam a choice he said you eat this you'll be fine you don't eat this you're not going to be you not be good I'm not going to be happy and you're not going to be happy but that little cloud in there became marred in Black then the logos came down now that's we're talking about Jesus Christ now and was made flesh and dwelt among us to redeem this man back to the love of the father and he came in by the baptism of the Holy Spirit and Chase sin out of the human praise God and brings man back again again in fellowship with God we would see Jesus in the beginning God was the spirit all The Fountains of goodness and mercy and power love God was the center of that Fountain and then the logos that went out of God in the be beginning became what we call a theophany in other words a supernatural body God is just not like the air he's in a body praise God Amen our God is so much different than what people analyze him to be in this world everywhere you see God he's a Doty old Granddaddy and he's walking around with ballal head ballal head no hair and whatever he's got is gray and a beard stooped over well that ain't God cuz you know why they go back to Daniel where it says the Ancient of Days well listen if you're Eternal You' be the Ancient of Days and look like a 18y old kid and that's what God did cuz he can't change and he didn't change when he came down here he just took on a flesh body and changed it back that's what he's going to do to me and you so Moses seen him pass and said he look like the back part of a man and so forth and then that same theophany was made flesh and dwelt among us we beheld him the only begotten of the father Christ you I was looking online uh just seeing what people thought about MDC you know out in the world and and different things and they they have no clue they're fighting over if it's just a it was just a a a dream that Abraham had and and it was a a priesthood so it was a bunch of people uh it wasn't just this one person and how can this one person talk to Adam I mean talk to Abraham and be without father and mother how can he do this and how can he do that how can that well it's God God veiled in human flesh good Lord see how they don't understand God can do whatever he wants to do cuz he's God but he can't do any more than what his word says John 1 says 18 says no man has seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father hath declared him as brother Brown says many times he said you don't see the real William brandham right here he said you see the shell that I inhabit cuz I believe today by the baptism of the the Holy Ghost your soul is not the age of your person outside how could your soul feel like you feel outside and be Eternal somebody talk to me and tell me that amen I'll be 64 coming up I got this ache in my arm that I ain't never had before I didn't even know I had a muscle there somebody was laughing the other day heard my one of the sermons I was talking about you know kids they just jump up out the bed and then I have to just say all right come on feet my hands get numb now cuz I put them over my head my yours too soon put see what I mean she's old I put um she's older than me you put your hand over here and then you get up in the morning you go and you do that you spend the rest of your waking mon morning doing this cuz you sure don't want to grab something with it cuz you don't know you got in your hand okay Michael's going yeah right sure sure you just wait I hope you don't see my age cuz you'd be doing my funeral so how do we declare God we declare God just the way Jesus did by his works by who he was he didn't look like God hold on a minute he was 50 something 30 something years old now remember God's a kid God's 18 years old he ain't never been old but he was unveiled in that flesh that came onto the Earth through the womb of a woman came into Satan's domain and right then his body began to began to deteriorate that's a paradox but inside of him his soul never got any older or younger than It Ever Was same thing with me and you that's swive by the baptism of the Holy Ghost I can see that my soul yes is 18 years old it's that image where' God get that image at he took a picture of you as brother R said way before the foundation of the world and you're going to come to that enies because he can't change his mind I said before if he loved you then he's going to love you now he canot love you why he loved Adam he canot love Adam even though what Adam did what Eve did he loved them both yes sir or he had destroyed them both and said hey I'm going to start over again but he didn't that's right he didn't say the day you eat there of and I you he said the day you eat thereof that day you're going to be cursed and you're going to die so the only begotten of the father ha declared him or definition of that is to unfold a teaching so God was stand I mean Jesus was standing there he said hey if you know me you'd know who my father is cuz I declare him and they looked at him and he said he said before Abraham was I am and they're they're looking natural they're going you're not even 50 years old and Abraham's about 800 years back that way well the I am wasn't the I am was back there before that the I am the one who what talk to it the I am is who Abraham met and and that am is who you and I got to meet cuz to meet him he'll change your body yes sir but to let him Walk On By there's no telling how many people people melaz walk by cuz remember that wasn't the first time that he he was with Abraham he found him in the first of his journey when he became Victorious and slaughtered the Kings he brought him Bread and Wine where'd he get that from right and he brought him into a group of people because there was Abraham and about 300 of his servants and and all everybody else was pretty much annihilated so he goes in and serves in communion what a mighty God we serve to know that we can the the the reason I think brother brandham could tell us so vividly all these stories is because God let him see them and by revelation we see him because you know what I was in mdc's Soul when he talked to Abraham you were in mdic Saul if you're born again when he talked to Abraham praise God that's why we can understand who Jesus says cuz we were there but remember we had that white cloud that cloud was was mared white and black right but where were you you were nothing only in the mind of God where was the mind of God when Jesus was on Earth it was inside of him pal waren Locust caterpillar the Blessed Holy Trinity it's a man-made scheme an old dirty Church rag wrapped around to take the place of the sap line of God's holy spirit I made you made some people mad that they there's no such a thing it don't bother us does it I hope it doesn't there's no such a thing you find it and come to me you're Duty bound to do it as a Christian if you find it it's not in God's word anywhere and the father son Holy Ghost is hatched Out of Hell there's no such a thing as three gods that theophany never taught that everybody with me but it took a man to come back and restore even according to the Old Testament there had to be a jubilee there had to be a release every seven years and then 77 seven the seventh time around 77s is 49 the 7eventh time around to the 49th year there had to be a jubilee where everything went free and that's what we'll get to in the church ages cuz there was a group that went three went free at the end of Paul irenius Martin all those right they went free by the baptism of the Holy Ghost but they never celebrated a jubilee year where everything went free because their body's laying over there somewhere in the grave or in the dust of the Earth all right so they didn't all get to go free there were some of them had some part of them had to stay but in the Jubilee you throw down the hole and you took everything you had and you left and you didn't have owe that guy nothing praise God that's our Jubilee the power of God was taken back to its original the 50th day of the year that's why we needed another Penta we needed a Pentecost we needed a 50 a jubilee not just a day 1906 was considered Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell but we should have a Pentecostal Jubilee every day as brother um Joe was saying the other day we need to let our hands and our mouth know it though Matthew 28:18 and Jesus came and spoke to them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth why he was in a body that was changed his body was eternal standing right there now before that it was dead cold in the grave just like the ones that are waiting now but by the quickening power what happened that same spirit that was in that man that theophany came back picked that body up and stood out there on the earth and said all power now has been given unto me in other words I've changed this thing yes sir right he that believeth in me shall have eternal life or everlasting life brother M said now look there'll come another ju Year of Jubilee and that we've had it just about this time now he's talking about the cycle of Pentecost 1906 and coming into now or then if you know this Pentecost has been falling in America for about 50 years see CU that was 1906 and this this was 1961 so he's a little more than 50 years and we've had it just about this time somewhere on that time 50 years ago Pentecost began to fall now that's what happened look the church is receiving now look who received the seven seal Book of Revelations who who who first church age nope second Church age no three four five six seven no they rejected him but we're under the seven seal book of the revelation of Jesus Christ of the Seven Seals and not one tenth of them can receive it wow that wasn't even that's one out of a hundred but when you begin to see the Year of Jubilee where we don't have to fuss and strain and pull like this but we're already secured in Christ we already have the name of the Lord Jesus in bapt watch what he's saying everything now is being restored back we have the correct water baptism we have the correct doctrin amen you can say whatever you want to about brother random his Doctrine was correct we have all these great Mysteries that were going to bring up in these Seven Seals and prove to you that them was the seals that were sealed from the eyes of the people because you know why Martin Luther Martin Luther was a trinitarian he preached that doctrine that was hatched from hell but God wasn't looking at that at that moment God was looking at him bringing a people out that just shall live by faith that's right amen all right then a little bit more then a little bit more and now that's why when you come to the seven seal book we we know all the Mysteries it's not sealed from the eyes of this people it's sealed from the eyes of the people down through the church ages of God being my helper I've Prov to you that they could not see that by the Bible then sure if the Bible said so you'll believe it that they could not see nothing but father Son and Holy Ghost until this time they could not see that there was no eternal eternal hell until this time amen so what is this this is the dispensation of the open book The dispensation to where we should not have to worry about water baptism we know what it is Revelations 3:14 what we've been talking about this is the one in our time and to the angel the Church of the layout of sins right now what was the angel the angel was a messenger right we had a messenger come right and what did he speak he spoke about the beginning of the creation of God the faithful and true witness not a false witness of a false baptism or the false witness of a eternal hell no he preached the truth yes right Jesus Christ is the beginning of the creation of God Revelations 1 is that right Revelations three really then when was God created he is the beginning of the creation of God and God is eternal is that right but when God was cre created when a little baby that was conceived in the womb of a mother a virgin she began to develop these C within her to bring forth this little baby that was the beginning of God's creation for God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and become Emanuel God With Us the beginning yes of the creation of God I'm going to read you a quote here in just a little bit brother R says you are now the continuation of that creation God didn't just create it and then destroy it uh-uh he created it for a purpose so God came down after going through this and now every son you eat born of a natural sex birth the way you come then when it comes to a place to where you go through water baptism then Holy Ghost baptism then the Holy Ghost comes down at the fire baptism and claims this creation the same as it did him the Holy Ghost and God is the same Spirit see it comes down and claims this body that's hard for people to understand because most people 99.9% of the people people that are not message Believers and a lot of message Believers believe the same thing this body you're never going to see again right you going to get a brand new one come from somewhere else ask you ask around it's this one redeemed that'd be really easy to just put this one in the dust and go get you another one because God's a creator but remember if we created in His image whatever image is inside of this guy now he must have enjoyed that whether you do or not amen and he put me in this flesh body give me 64 years in a couple weeks but I'm still in the image of what he saw me back before the foundation of the world but now that that has come to connect to my body down here it's going to stay there whether I pass away and my soul go in another dimension my soul's going to come back and pick that same body up cuz let me ask you a question was Jesus's body in the Tomb after he resurrected isn't he our example yes sir isn't he the first born from the dead amen right he had an empty tomb we we we we that's what we hang on to that there's no body in a graveen cuz everybody else has died whether you cremated throw in the water or wherever you got something somewhere in this earth yes sir God didn't he was born from above remember came down here and when he stepped out and said all power in Heaven and Earth has been given unto me he had an eternal body still could eat still could talk but he didn't need a door to get through praise God it comes down and claims this no Atlanta traffic boy that just come to my mind travel like a thought I go visit brother Dy man I got to worry about all that traffic I to make you happy there he comes down and claims this body for the resurrection and he was raised for our justification all the father has given me will come not one will be lost I'll raise it up now it doesn't listen if he wasn't going to keep up with you why would he say that no one will be lost now he didn't mean lost like in your soul but lost I can't I can't find his body I know I made it but I just can't find it and even brother random he says it's not exactly the same gases it may not be the same gas you emitted while you were here I'm talking about the body but it is your image of you it is your flesh wherever it was wherever it is it's coming back now here's the quote this is that is the beginning not one hair on your head will ever perish that is the beginning of the creation of God this is the continuation of the creation of God you and me yes then the whole earth has to have a baptism and then the Holy Ghost comes down in a city to dwell upon the earth and the Tabernacle of God is with man and dwells with them God has tabernacled here on Earth this whole Redemption plant justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost the same as it is then now he's talking about if you look in the future home he's talking about the same identical thing cu earth goes through and I'll read it here in just a minute cuz see that's where denominations also see the reason denominations can believe that this Earth is going to be destroyed CU I'm going to read it fervent Heat going to be all that I'll read it here in just a minute Peter remember brother R uses that scripture in the future home right but it's not annihilated so he's not going to annihilate your flesh and give you another one right everybody with me if he doesn't annihilate the Earth he can annihilate you cuz watch Isaiah 65 says for behold I create new Heavens now boy say new who that's new yeah it is and a new Earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mine praise God for that but be ye glad and rejoice forever in that which I create for I behold I create Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy praise God there's going to come earthquakes there's going to come a fervent heat there's going to come a power a Holy Ghost Fire that's going to burn everything off it's going to take this world that's wobbling it's going to take this world that's wobbling and it's going to set it upright we'll be able to enjoy the pleasures of God second Peter 3:9 says the Lord is not slack concerning his promises some men count slackness but it's longsuffering to us word praise God not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise now watch it it just seems like when you read this that God's just going to ain't going to start right back over Crea again no listen what God created the first time he can't uncreate he can't but he can hide it from the wise and prudent and show that they believe it's going to be destroyed and we're going to like live on this cloud or we're going to go to this new residence and it really tells us in scripture brother Dy that the that John saw the city coming down where was John standing he was standing on Earth he saw it coming down so it's going to sit down on the earth thank God for a prophet that just pull those little nuggets out of the Bible to tell us and he even read this scripture and he goes back and and goes into the Greek and where it says you know annihilate and all these different things well it doesn't really mean that it just burns it off same way he did with with me and you like I said before this that used to hold a beer now holds a Bible so God didn't have to cut it off and give me a a Bible hand he took the beer hand he took the beer he took the foul mouth and the eyes and just changed them that's why Holy Ghost Fire can burn you and you not even oh yeah you'll show it but you're not going to be annihilated and then walk back in a new person that's the mystery it would not be a mystery if you could do that if everybody could just disappear and reappear as a you know 100% perfect person but that wouldn't be the plan of God he can be a savior A Healer Redeemer all these different compound names of Jehovah that we see that's connected to this body absolutely and what we do on this earth right but the day of the Lord shall come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with great noise and the elements shall melt now it didn't say annihilate it's it says the element shall melt with fervent heat the Earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up well it sounds like it's just going to totally no it took a prophet to go back and tell us that doesn't mean what it looks like it means right seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of person ought to be ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and Hasting unto the coming of the day of of God wherein the heaven shall be on fire and shall be dissolved and the element shall melt with fervent heat question mark nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness and that word new is not new like throw it away and bring a new one out is to renew or renovate that's what he did to me and you he renovated our that's right right you look at house renovation how many ever ever been through one I've been through one what you do you burn it start over no you renovate you take out the old you take out the diseased you take out the weak yes sir and you make it strong again but the bones of that house is still there you know something people tell you those house builders will say boy that house has got good bones what does it mean it's got a good structure to it right now you can take all this out and redo it but the structure the bones is still here well guess what God's not going to lose the one of them he said remember God perfecting his church 1954 this is why we can see you can't destroy deity you can't destroy the deity of God so deity lays in the mind that's received the Holy Spirit you're are a son I'm a brandham by birth part of Mr M brandham is in me and if you become a son or a daughter of God part of deity lays in you yes sir part of the city lays in you part of the power to speak and things happen am power of the spoken word and I didn't do this God did this he said I'm not going to be here to do it you're going to do it I'm going to do it through you yes sir I'm not going to be here physically talking about the breath is where brother Ram talks about Adam he was a breathing living man so he's a breathing living man and then we keep going a little bit further he says look CU God breathed not what nature done but what God did breathe the breath of life into his nostrils and he became a living Soul so you and I at the new birth that's what we get and that's what happened that's why I stuck that in there is that's what's going to happen to the new Heaven and the new Earth God's going to breathe on It come on cuz it's the fire of God it's not man's fire listen the battle of Armageddon is going to be man's fire we're going to come back in the Millennium and there's still going to be trees and this building may still be here they may be structure still here cuz brother R said remember that seventh day Satan's still alive he's bound but this sin curse is still here come on until the future home comes that's right cuz we're still in seven days the seventh day it lasts all the way to White Throne judgment so God what is he going to do he going to breathe the breath of eternal life into us then we're going to what we're going to be taken out set up somewhere then he's going to take nature we're going to get that six seal nature there's a destruction of nature in the sick seal yes by a holy fire right not man's fire man's fire only Burns so much God's fire burn Burns it completely up come on you know what though he can burn a bush and not even bother it he can burn you yes sir and not even bothering but you what you'll do you'll outwardly produce what just got put inside of you okay cuz you talking about Adam already in his nostrils he had become the breath of eternal life and he became the living Soul he everybody understand that I don't have to go over that again especially on Adam he breathed the breath of eternal life and he became an eternal person with God so do me and you yes power like God amateur God but what happened was there was that cloud came in of sin and that's what we're born under but the new birth should be what letting out all that getting rid of the flu that are stopped up the unclean Spirit goes out of a man here stands a white horse here stands a lamb and there goes a white horse rider things are going away from us and God's coming and filling us up cuz Dwight Moody said God will only fill those who are not full of their self there's not room for you and God now it's just got to be God all right that's what we call preeminence the church is a mystical Body of Christ born of the Breath of God he talks about spiritually so we're going to talk about the same thing spiritually Church born of the Breath of God cuz if you walk around in the world and and you talk to people and they know you're a little different but I mean us men we could walk in any church and sit down and be just like the next guy but when a sister walks in and sits down with the dress on right they go what's wrong with her oh granny you know what though that's the bride so now we got to transfer that back to us men we don't have long hair we don't chew the bager we don't XYZ right cuz we are the Bride of Jesus Christ we are feminist in the body of of Christ because we're born by the Breath of God when you become a child of God you're born by the Breath of God the breath of almighty God he already gave you a a body and and your parents that body you got a spirit Soul right he give you that already that's what nature he has a law when something starts breathing when something need to start breathing he breathes and gives them life but it didn't give them eternal life that's why we're all born dead until we do get the Breath of God not in our lungs in our very Soul amen and cleans us out first God makes a soul and a spirit and it goes into the body we understand that I'll just keep going a little bit further we'll close here in just a second soon as it's born but there's a spirit and a soul hanging near that mother to come into that body just as soon as it's born just as soon as that's baby born God has created a soul and created a spirit to be in that baby just as soon as it's born in this world now look that little baby becomes matured and it begins to learn like we've always said before you take a 5-year-old girl and a 5-year-old boy put him in a bathtub give him a bath and they're just playing you know and they're throwing water and 10 years later don't do that am same two people same scenario what's happened their carnal mind has been activated yes sir all right everybody with me just as soon as that baby is born God has created a soul and created a spirit to be in that baby just as soon as it's born in this world that little baby becomes matured and it begins to learn then it becomes a living Soul now remember it wasn't a dead Soul it becomes alive to what it becomes alive to the senses of the world yes this is right this is wrong cuz I want to ask you a question I just told you what brother B said all babies go to heaven now how many of your kids never started lying till they're about 14 God don't hold it accountable to you because you don't know really what you're doing you're just born under that curse cuz listen if brother R said all babies go to heaven when you come to the age of accountability listen three and four five year old kids they'll lie to you but God don't account that to them because God is so gracious to have all that already set up sister Alicia he had it all set up he knew we'd have babies yes sir he knew that we'd have and listen all those babies that have that have died you think well that's horrible maybe not so they going to be in heaven but if they' have got up to 14 or 15 years old and made the wrong decision they might not have been in heaven thank God for a gracious God that knows then it becomes intelligent it's growing on now that's kind of brother R I got a little problem with that people get kids get intelligent at 14 maybe 34 but I you know what he's talking about it becomes intelligent it's growing all the time in God's Great economy now listen here's what brother B tells us I'll say this by the authority of God's word all right every baby that's under the age of accountability that dies goes to glory amen yes sir Christ died to take away the sin of the world and when you come to the age of accountability we're all born in sin but when he died he taken away the sin and when you come to the age of accountability then you're responsible from then on all right now the age of accountability you can count that whatever you want to you're the only one that knows that one day you're you're going to say I really shouldn't have done that that wasn't right so I can't say well now when you get 14 you're no may be different than some but you'll know you're not responsible for something you did not do Christ done died to save you to take away the sin that Adam caused we always think Eve caused that Adam caused it Adam's one his sold us out but when you sin you have to confess your sins first you have to confess it but the babies's done no sin it it's not accountable for what it does and Christ died to free that baby and if it's born of a parent drunkard or whatever they might be that baby goes to heaven I believe it and I believe it'll come to recognition of the Cross now watch this this struck me right here never read this quote before I read many about age of accountability but maybe I didn't read far enough now look and I believe it'll come to recognition of the Cross when it gets there to know that Christ died for it thank God for a prophet do you understand what he's saying if a 5-year-old kid dies they don't know anything about Jesus Christ they probably heard it in many different languages but not the real the right one right right my right but when he go that person goes or that kid individual goes into whatever holding place there is heaven or whatever Dimension he comes to or she comes to a realization an angel probably comes up and says hey buddy the reason you goty here called that guy right there and let me tell you about what happened and now because the baby is far as Sin it has none wow Jesus died to take away the sins of the world and the baby has done no sin only it was it's a sinner it's born in sin but when Christ died at Calvary he took away the sins of the world and the baby is not responsible until it becomes to the age of accountability any little baby no matter how sinful the parents are as soon as it dies it goes straight to the arms of Christ because he prayed the price no matter if it was a baby born in sin by adultery or whatever it is makes no difference at all that baby is safe with Christ because he died to take away the sins absolutely of the the world now what now look though and when he gets old enough now that it's done personal sin then it has to repent for what it's done personal sin because remember the Bible says you don't pay for the sin of your father you pay for your sin but it has no personal sin look until it's old enough to commit sin to know which is right and which is wrong thank God for a God that do that can do that that knew that Millions listen there's billions of babies d before the age of accountability they're going to be in heaven what a mighty God we serve all right let's stand we'll we'll we'll cover this more this afternoon didn't get to my point but we'll get to it here in just a minute we'll get to it this afternoon would you love the Lord the Lord's gracious isn't he to tell us that that baby doesn't have any sin you look at it you don't listen you might call it a little bit sinner but it ain't not in God's eyes okay not in God's eyes but now kids when you realize you go oh I shouldn't have done that and I'm going to hide it from if you start hiding stuff from your parents you've reached the age of capability right when you start hiding stuff and and not telling them the truth all the truth and you know you're going to hide it cuz you did this over here then yeah you you probably need to start repenting asking God to toh forgive you of your sins and baptize you with the Holy Ghost let's sing a song God bless you I looked over Jordan and what did I see com For To Carry Me Home was a b of angels coming after me Coming For To Carry Me Home swing s For To Carry Me Home swing Lord [Applause] sweet for to carry me home well if

go problem is some people ain't seen him go yet all right they still press play and they still think he's coming back oh yeah he's coming back right he's coming back on that Chariot cuz Elijah got caught up one day and a chariot firing Angels horses hey Elisha saw it but Elisha saw that he left and know what he said he he say when you see he said when you see me leave if you're here if you're in the disp if you're in a dispensation to be able to see me and have a revelation that I've left I'm going to send you back a double portion of what I got I read you a quote this afternoon where brother Bri tells us he said when that headstone comes in the end time he said what you've seen now what did we see millions of Miracles we saw um third Paul we saw things being created he said what you see in the minority what you have seen he said you'll see in its fullness double portion I like that song Days of Elijah but we're not in the Days of Elijah anymore I think the Bible says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel we're the Elisha now brother said Elisha typed the what the bride yeah oh yeah he's gone on but we saw leave we know he's over there waiting but he sent back 1,00 and something manels cuz what did Elisha do with that manle before he left he did a miracle he said where be the god of Elijah and that water party just the same as it did when Elijah was here so
