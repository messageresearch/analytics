open Dory can do it all right but remember now to pray for these I know little Abby we say to her hey Abby she'll be watching this morning she has come down with a coughing and sore throat and things and running the temperature so Anna called and I said well with the temperature let her stay at home needs to stay inside anyway so that's that's good you know and Sister Barbara is sick and Brother Dean Gibby he's sick so remember that the Addison's are gone to their grandson on the programs are whatever they do you know or something and these are the ones we know that are missing in the reasons why all right so remember that now the little baby that we were praying for especially last night we were praying she had a little temperature remember the little baby out in New Mexico that uh you know Rachel and EMS uh what is his name David David and her he's you know and the little girl had to tree things he holds in her heart when she was born well they were worried because really when they did find out that it was worse than they thought and she could have died at any time with what they had but God took care of her and said she came through the operation you know had the temperature is going down everything's okay now so we thank God for the healing virtues because we believe it all right and just keep praying for her now because she's still got a lot of a lot of problems and things but you know God's on his way okay now remember they will not be I'm trying to make these announcements where you won't forget it they will not be a service here on December the 25th that's on Wednesday so there won't be a Wednesday service that week all right the watch not service will be on December the 31st which is on Tuesday all right so there will not be a Wednesday service that week all right because that would be the first of January okay any other announcements I generally forget something but just remember these announcements and things and all but you know pray to the Lord would bless and guide each one okay anything else I need to announce okay Romans 8 and we're going to first John 4 7-10 but Romans 8. it's where we've been reading from and we pray that the Lord would add his Blessing to the reading of the word is think about these things we've read this 44 times but we still not run out yet so then don't worry about it we just keep reading it you know in doing it let's pray father we thank you we love you we just ask you Lord to be with us today in your loving grace and give each and every one of us your love Lord your lot and let each one Lord receive from you because we believe you and we thank you we just ask you to have your way Lord in our hearts and our lives and that you would show us your word that is it opens unto us then we learn to walk therein have your way in forgive our sins bless those that are not here the sick ones Lord touch each one and may your love be with each and every one of us we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen also before forget it there are some notes up here from last night's Bible study the topic of last night's Bible study was the eight manifestations of God Seven Church ages seven angels but eight manifestations of God if you don't get that you're going to miss the whole thing an entirely Miss where brother Brown says the messenger comes at the end of the age now did Paul come at the end of Ephesus if he did how could he bring the message to Ephesus and anybody out there we're like you know I know we're sarcastic but we do know too that The Messengers you can't place their births their life inside of the ages a lot of time it may be over here it may be over here so let's quote random he said the messenger to each age was the messenger of that age that spoke for God and in great manifestations brought the message of that time all right the one who would be the greatest or the closest to the word would be the messenger of the age because you can't figure those you take the ages and try to get their verses when they were born and when they died you can't Brew it all right so just as I said the other day why why do we always have to figure everything out will that happen on December the 31st on three o'clock well no it wasn't at four o'clock see we got to be so smart ethically know it all take the message and believe it and see what God can do for each and every one of us all right now I'm sorry that's just me okay Romans 8. and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are thee called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many brethren or over whom he did predestinate then he also called in whom he called him he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us great statement right first John 4 7. through 10. beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and North God you know love covers the multitude of sin so I don't have any problems if you love me you're going to look over my thoughts and failures you know what because I got to look over yours okay we're all in the same boat all right he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love and this was manifest the love of God toward us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him herein is love not that we love God but he loved us and sent his son to be the perpetuation for our sins you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now this past Wednesday I felt led to just read and we did of a vast amount out of the church age book about the predestinations and the things we've been talking about and doing and I hope you enjoyed it if not getting to listen to it I'd ask you to listen to it and uh that way it's just like I was saying about the eight manifestations of God last night if you want that copy you know just send us a note we'll try to send it to you because we do copy all of it but we couldn't do it with the screen to show what we were drawing so if you want to know something just ask us we'll try to help you the best we can all right because we want to you know get everything in the right order but we're talking about how does God predestinate now we know he predestinates by his foreknowledge he would at all be saved all right he doesn't predestinate we gave it we've read it over and over the prophet said he doesn't predestinate by his desires because he desired everybody to be saved well it was just he's specially picked now if he's specially picked the people the way you're saying it then he's the author of confusion and you can't connect it with the prophet's message so that you know go and do what you want to because you are anyway it's not going to change anything unless God speaks to our heart all right now then doing it we we covered our Wednesday that that it was necessary the end that God come himself all right amen brother Branham said and I've got these laying here if you desire them he says on paragraph 129 of the revelation of Jesus Christ and I'm going to ask him to pull them up I just got a quotes on some of it brother Ron said he couldn't trust nobody with it but brother tell you just don't understand we believe in the Trinity a father a son and a Holy Ghost and they can trust each other you believe what you want to but the prophet said he couldn't trust nobody else so he came himself and see we say well we didn't you know you just you're just so carnal I agree but I can at least they want the prophet said he said he couldn't trust nobody so he came himself who came God Almighty came down in human flesh to pay the price but you said but brother Dale like I said Wednesday you said but my God can't die and you're saying he died how many quotes you need from the prophet where he said God died now you're arguing with him how many scriptures you want out of the Bible where it talks about that he was almighty God right and then you're going to deny it he died hey we got enough sense to know great Eternal God cannot die so that's why he brought a flesh into being that's it right there amen see then he could remove the life out of the flesh and the flesh died as I always say I can cut your head off but I can't kill you your soul just steps out of that body right into another dimension right that's right well see we got it all figured out so we people say my God can't die well boy rush so and so straighten him out God can't die right around said he died in flesh all right you argued the point with him I don't have no problems with it so I'm not going to argue with you about it I'm just going to say what kind of a gospel you've got because we've got the only religion in the world that required that our God had to die now you say well brother there what happened okay I believe it's the unveiling of God if you want a technical quote brother random said he acted the part of death yeah man now that's your words if you want that we'll be glad to find it acted the part of death why because we're in the actual play right around said he tore that soul out of that body it was hanging on Calvary he said in body he was a man but said in spirit he was God Amen he said in body he was a man but said in Soul he was God all right so God came down to live in a human body that Hebrews 10 5 he had created and when he did he just simply stepped right back out of that body amen what kind of a Doctrine have you got what are you going to feed it out do you see that away then I'm not a Oneness but I'm not a trinity because that God in human flesh he would make a way for you and I run around and said he couldn't send a son you want the quotes are laying here he didn't send a sign said he came in South all right that's according to whether we believe in one God or not but even if you say you don't believe in one God how are you going to explain that you mean God sent a son now what about your Eternal sonship then because that's your trinitarian Doctrine isn't it God the Father God the son God the Holy Ghost co-equal and co-eternal how can a son be co-equal with a father and how can a son that it means it had a beginning be eternal so the body had a beginning but that soul in that spirit that stepped into that body when he came into the world according to the Bible said it was God with us Emmanuel all right see the prophet said would you send somebody to die in your place well yeah I would well then you're not a good daddy yeah no forget it but he didn't send somebody else he came himself now I wish you would go home and run in only begotten now there's Old Testament scriptures referring to other people and so and so was the only begotten but just run into your Bible and the only begotten we just read that he was the only begotten right now if that's true that he's the only begotten of the father he then where are we at only begotten the word begotten means to um procreate or or in other words like a father that ability for children to come forth then is called and begotten and brother random said Adam was straight from the hand of God by creation he said but Jesus was the only begotten right look that up when you're saying only begotten look it up to see it literally means the only wand that came that way is that sensible yeah if you're saying they only begotten it means the only one that came that way now Adam came by creation sure right but Jesus was the only begotten right all right the only begotten would mean that he's the only one that was begotten now you and I come forth because that he fulfilled his part and said to eternal life and then he could beget many sons right but if he was the only begotten that means he's the only one the only one ever be that way because you and I come as sinners and have to be born again amen right right but then if it can be get or bring us on to the place because the word beget or begot really bored but God's not the scriptures begotten the word beget is begotten or begotten is beget all right which means the only one that ever was and the only one that'll ever be because you and I didn't come virgin born right but he was he come virgin born because he was created in the wound of Mary said he was begotten of a woman wow but then he explains what it means the blood of almighty God whatever you want to call it germ sperm egg whatever to bring forth that body was straight from almighty God as begotten amen and nobody else I don't care how good you think you are are going to be one day it'll still be that he's the only begotten all right then we must have him to bring us to that place that's what I was trying to bring our wins to see the only begotten means nobody else coming that away all right amen is that sensible I'm accused of being so deep of what I say I'm so I'm too simple because I tried to explain it deep people don't try to explain what they're saying because they want you to keep thinking how good how deep they are so when somebody says I got a mystery but I can't explain it you automatically know you got a problem there's plenty of mysteries in the Bible I can't explain but what's been revealed to me I can explain it and so can you that's right amen all right around said there's one thing you can do you can tell how the candle got lit right so you can tell that and if God reveals himself to you as I've always said about sister Birds when I preached that night hour and a half trying to explain did he come from God and he went to God and going back home at night and this sister couldn't even she wouldn't even have a vacuum cleaner she swept the floor the only stove she had had to have a button on the button off washers or everything everything had to because we had to go with her to buy them and we was going home at night she said brother Dale I see what you're talking about I said okay sis she said he come from God and he went to God said he was God the whole time wasn't he I said I wish I'd let you preached I spent an hour and a half trying to explain that she put it in two words or three yeah see because she got a revelation a lot of difference when we get a revelation or something man all right but think about it now he never sent a son he came himself how many quotes do you need of that I'll be glad to give you these notes after the service and over these quotes here and you can copy all you want to because if I'm not saying what he's saying then I need to be gotten out of the way run around said it was a neat um paragraph let's start on this number six let's do that let's start on number six Brother Anderson I guess he's back there he's missing this is paragraph 104 and 105 the god rich in Mercy 1965. 119. look what he says this was to be an eternal atonement now what about an eternal atonement you remember the sacrifice of the animals they could only cover sin right right but we have an eternal amen sacrifice that's what I depend on amen why because he was made eternal so whatever I need body spirit and soul I got an eternal Covenant when I really tell you you don't understand it's only Everlasting you don't understand either it's eternal amen it's just Everlasting because that's where we're here when we get dire we don't need to have a because what we're going to be willing with it okay this was to be an eternal atonement because he came himself God came himself in the form of sinful flesh look to make a a Eternal atonement and suffered In the Flesh and made the atonement and returned back in the form of the Holy Ghost to confirm that atonement we're no bright surferred or no troubles Waters he's not throwing off on those two that was in the Bible the bride serpent was right the troubled waters was right but that was only temporarily it all pointed to that perfect atonement God rich in his Mercy has did this right an eternal atonement yes yes why would we worry about it then why are you concerned whether well I don't know whether I made it no we didn't make it he did I'm not dependent on whether I make it or not I'm dependent on whether he made it but he says I'm not depending on it right look what it turned out to be let's read a little scripture Matthew 1 21-23 let's just read a little bit and she shall bring forth a son and I shall call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled what his dying giving his life making a way Etc what then it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying Behold a virgin she'll be with child and thou shalt bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which is being interpreted is God With Us man God With Us not a second person you see me brother Dale you mean after 40 years you're still talking about whether how many persons they are yeah because I find among the ministers this message is the most confused doctrines of the godhead that us Baptists never went that far off and it can prove to you where your doctrines come from you say the River Jordan says that Jesus wouldn't God deliver Jordan that's exactly what there's an argument in Isaiah so you got the doctrine from there look at this first Timothy 3 16. and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness the second person of the trinity huh oh that's not what that says it says God was manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit scene of angels preached into the Gentiles I wish I could get to that and preach the service about it so how did he preach to the he never preached to the Gentiles nope he done that in the book of Acts okay believed on in the world received up into Glory what about it look at Colossians 2 8-9 there's a few scriptures be Wireless any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ right you remember over in Colossians I mean over in Corinthians were he said like Eve was deceived over the Simplicity of Christ verse 9 for in him dwell all the fullness of the godhead bodily all right one true and living God that we really believe that right and I gave them to you where brother Brandon says God keeps his word 1957 in body he was Man soul he was God Comforts with God 59 body he was a man in spirit he was God look at number 13. paragraph 226 of the revelation of Jesus Christ 1960. 1204 in the morning service and then have a beginning because he's talking about a son can't be no but it can't be no Eternal sonship right because there's no such a thing as an eternal son a son had a beginning so we can't be Eternal so the Flesh of Jesus as we would call him the son of God had a beginning it had a time it had to be made eternal that's right right come on sensible see there is no so-called there's no such thing as an eternal son at a beginning so he can't be Eternal you see he is the Eternal God not the Eternal Sun Glory the almighty Jehovah Jehovah Rapha made manifest in flesh in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily see then believing in one true and living God what do we believe now so then who was that and how did he live in body he was a man that body had a beginning spirit and soul in that body was almighty God are he wasn't God but you don't understand the great mystery see don't you just see that mystery it is unfold that he was not then he was well I think about where it says over in Revelation he that was and is not and was and is not and was and is not wasn't it is not means popes was that the way your Prophet said so what are you calling him that's right brother said no man could die like that man died there was no human mortal could stand what that man stood that's right if he was a Son of God as a trinitarian concept then would you allow your son to be beat that much when all you had to do was just right that's right you didn't have to move right you didn't have to even speak you only had to think and would have ended all there he was sure as a mortal crying out my God my God why is Thou forsaken me sure he was a human mortal in body tempted as in all points as we are yet without sin but then one day that body was made eternal all right so we have an eternal atonement as we started off with Laura go see in body he was my brother huh Darcy kinsman redeemer had to come into being because your kinsman redeemer would would have to cover all things in Redemption so right around said all that Adam lost Jesus Christ restored all right amen now so then in body he was a man and security with almighty God because he said into thy hand I commend my spirit and in Soul he was the soul of God that your Prophet said he died and went to hell he said what went to hell he said he sold his Spirit his person of his being that's not Oneness see one that says that Jesus was the life's manifestation of God I don't agree with that because the Bride of Jesus Christ is the life's manifestation in the Gentile dispensation then once we leave here there will be more of God to be revealed and the Jews 144 000 will be that manifestation of God see so it's not running out it's coming to a place of understanding so he's not the Eternal son he's the Eternal God he said I don't believe in Eternal sonship but he said I believe in eternal godship you want that quote any computer eternal godship yeah if I can find it surely you can because I'm computer illiterate I still don't know how to figure that out Eternal God but not sonship you that are really up on it can do that without them cut it short and I have to run through the rest of it because if you know how to use the software you can cut your quotes down real quick but I just learned to do it the old way and I'm still there I was on dos until 10 years ago okay but now listen you and I are Body Spirit and soul right right now the Lord willing someone asked me to so we'll drop from that point because I don't want to go too far because I was asked here a while back to speak on the soul so I will try to bring that into the message and show the new birth the it doesn't bother me to preach it over again but listen he became my brother when he became man on Earth he became my Kinsmen Redeemer in the bases that he had to give that life so that life within him could be able to come back the Bible said the Holy Ghost has not been guilt because Jesus Christ has not been crucified or glorified every which way you want to put it see he had to die to release that life does everybody understand it he had to die to release the life that was in him without that life in him we do not have the new birth so the prophet said as we read that I want to go he sent back then there's another quote to go anywhere you want them then he sent back on the day of Pentecost his soul in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he said when that had all given out then it would be finished all right and see then church he paid the price amen he had to pay that price that I can live all right now if there's more than one God you can talk about all kind of things but if you're dealing with one God then you've got to be dealing with it was necessary that he died or release that life that was within him that shouldn't need a revelation that should be sensible you know even the Baptist would tell you Jesus had to die of course he don't understand it but he tell you how to die because there's no way it's like I told you the other day why couldn't he as standing there he was almighty God why couldn't he just turn around and speak and make our bodies eternal don't you believe he could speak the word he raised the dead man He restored a man that had been dead and rotten why couldn't he just speak the rest of it what you see that would have not given the thing that he come to do now Rita wants you to run into your com your Bible and study it about the only begotten you see the son of man was the only begotten come on you said but these prophets their son of man they're a son of man right do you need that Jesus Christ was the son of man that's why in his life he never declared as the prophet said himself to be the son of God because he wasn't fulfill in that office he'd done that on a day of Pentecost and been Son of God down through seven churches hey he said he was fulfilling the office of Son of Man we deal as son of man thinking about profit that's right that's good we we got that much but just remember the only way he could become kin folks to you and I was to be the son of man amen not meaning he come from man right Mary didn't have anything to do with it right come on not meaning did he come from man it means he come as a man right the son of man now watch him as he's on Earth he said to son of man hath power to what forgive sins who can forgive sins no one can forgive sins unless it's God right see there's no forgiveness outside of Jesus Christ what now he's the only begotten because he's the only son of man it's over about into the um somewhere in anointed ones are right about in there in my mind I'll catch it in a minute but he said get this straightened out he said it's the seventh Church age messenger he said it's not the son of man said the son of man is God himself well people say brother random will speak some of them no no he says that he was a son of man if he was decent of man that's Jesus Christ right amen come on you've gone into deity but the wrong way I truly believe in deity but I don't believe it like that that's what I told the man up in Jeffersonville one time he was standing there talking about brother Brown I'm being deity I said let me tell you something I said I believe that man there got the Holy Ghost if you'll say that man by the Holy Ghost Inside of him his deity take away the fact that brother Branham and all the gifts and all the signs and the Wonders and let brother random stand here I'll agree with you in deity because that man's deity as well as this man's deity oh no he said well you know who you're talking to but see the son of man is the Lord Jesus Christ he was the one that was in all of those prophets back there that spoke it wasn't Moses telling God a better way to do something come on who was it right running around and said it was Christ in Moses see Moses wasn't this on a man the son of man when you say the it means singular that's what I tried to tell him Baptist huh it said John the Baptist in the scripture right there at the lights I tried my best to show them I said if it says John be Baptist ain't never been but one and why you want to say you're a Baptist right because there was only one of them John the Baptist if it said John a Baptist then they could be more Baptist you see I didn't get along too good back there either you know so I've kind of been in that all my life I guess kind of a troublemaker but you know I still do the best I can and I love everybody I think I'll try to prove that you never respected I can do but do you understand what it means to be decent amount read just read the quotes read the scriptures well let's let's do that brother well I got him on the back especially the last one I told them I might not need these but hang on I might need them okay jump back over on the back of your notes for yeah brother and let's start off John 1 14. now who was John 1 14. in the beginning of his word word is with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh who the son of man and dwell among us and we beheld his glory the glory as the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth the only one ever be gotten that away the only son of man the only Thief son of man John 1 18 goes up and it says no math has seen God at any time the only begotten which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him brought him out into the open to you know open where he could be seen it declared him okay going to John 3 14. as Moses a serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son uh verse 14 he said it was the son of man that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of God come on are we in the scripture go to the next one uh yeah first John 5 1 whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and everyone that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him so if you love the one who begat that's God you're going to have to love the one that is begotten of him which would be God in human flesh I thought we believed it Lula at least that the Bride of Jesus Christ according to Revelations 1 about 13 or 14 says he's standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like unto the son of man gird about the pouts with a golden girdle the feminist picture of the bride of Christ right that's what God thinks of us first John 5 18 we know that whosoever is born of God sent us not but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself in that one Wicked one toucheth him not he could never touch him because he was begotten of God now if you and I can be begotten of him right I thought that's what we believe the new birth was I thought that was what we thought it was that he is begotten of God keepeth himself he kept himself he was the only begotten we're begotten through him right because he had to come and pay the price the only way the life could come back up on anybody you only had the anointing in the Old Testament right the anointing was there the anointing of the Old Testament never made them Sons and Daughters of God right I want the scripture for it I want the profit forward I want to see it where it's at I think because Jesus Christ had not died the scripture says on until he died there was no one able to come into the kingdom of God because that kingdom was within him the scripture says right come on have you read your Scriptures it says it was in him the kingdom was within him they wandered seed organization arguing even this message arguing well was it in him or was it out here or was it in them people the Bible said it was in him I ain't got no argument the Bible said in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead modeling got no argument the Bible said in him was Emmanuel God With Us got no problem he was declared to be the son of man with power and honor and Glory amen he could forgive sins he could raise the Dead right yep see what a wonderful thing to think about what you and I have been told a Christmas message yes what have we have been told the truth of the word of God or did we don't have to bow down to anybody what I think you know everybody's got a way of justifying everything into you you know what when I'm talking to you I expect can I stop a pause a minute and look at the internet you know and say you're getting what I mean I expect I expect you to not understand what I'm saying yep brother Dale yeah cause you're human and if you said it to me I wouldn't understand you I might sympathize with it to say there's no better way of saying it but unless it's revealed you don't know what I'm talking about right unless it's revealed I told you I was a good old-fashioned maybe Oneness when I was in the Baptist Church and I believe that Jesus was so much almighty God that he couldn't stump his toe that's what I believed but I couldn't explain it that's why when brother Modi said what do you believe about God I said we Baptist believe in one true and living God he said right he knew the Baptist Doctrine and that is the Baptist Doctrine he said can you explain I said yeah God three persons now you're a sensible man and said a person's a personality personality is an individual individuals person he said your Trinity is like everybody else you know what that wasn't revealed to me it was just plain sense there was no other way of saying it you listen to brother Branham listen to right around and we've talked about the other night my wife said listen to him explaining simple things the theologians sitting there at that great Trinity that nobody can't explain the prophet gets up and he said you're a father you're a human and you're a son I don't make you three and then with theologians if we can't argue with him but we don't believe it right they went back home believing the same thing like that 300 preachers that run around and explain water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and they got up and said we want the tapes we're going to take us to our church not a one of them he said ever was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ see once they walked away from him That Old Devil come back and you're going to lose your church you're gonna lose your money you don't have to go to work for a living yeah right come on folks I think it's time to get in or get out that's what I told a man at my house years ago he was sitting there talking about something and I said listen brother why don't you get in or get out they believed that brother random just come and laid a foundation he's explaining it to me wrote around this laid a foundation we're supposed to be where the word comes to now I said well tell me what the seventh seal is in boy he shut up he said you're the teacher you tell me I said that don't work with me I asked the question to you I said why don't you get in the message or get out the man's own wife Stood Beside of him and said brother Dale you're exactly right and until this day I don't know of her ever believing truly the message right you certainly don't believe in him but you see church we claim to believe this we claim to believe that but can we put our life on it because we're going to have to pretty quick whether you believe it or not you're going to be put on the line pretty quick and what I'm watching now is people just dying and falling away yeah just slowly falling away from that surge that violence within them when they first heard of the message and the desire to know about God and now they're just Falling Away you're talking about so and so yeah yeah any problem talking about you any problem they say don't play with me on words like I told Wade the other day and I mean it you come in my office and you talk to me I'll listen to anything you got to say but when I call you in my office you ain't gonna talk I'm gonna do the talking when I call you in there I'll talk to you you won't pity pattern baby around with me I'll Stand and look in your face and tell you I don't believe it I've had to do it and I keep on doing it why because I got to be one thing I've got to be to the bases that I've got something I can depend on and that's this message my whole life is in this message it's got something else I don't have no Swift bank account just in case this thing don't work and I don't have no denominational friends just in case it don't work and I can go back if I stand alone I'll stand it by myself why because I believe in one true and living God and I believe he is a great God of I am brother Dale we're not all like that's right there's some people that are disturbing enough to believe you see that's what I believe in and when I hear Brothers say something I'm not satisfied this is a quotient no no that's right I'm going to quote this and then I'll take it up Wednesday because I know I can't get through if I do I'm gonna be late you know that in all of your world believes and there were things that Jesus died to give you an inheritance well that's what it sounds like he's talking about a while ago brother Reynolds said he never died to give you an inheritance he said he died to bring you back to that it hurt we'll take that up Wednesday but think about it now maybe you ought to think this way there's many ways to make an inheritance I can give the kids money you know and I tell them that's part of your inheritance they'll also tell them and I want to buy me a Bad Boy Buggy that's part of your inheritance that you ain't gonna get you got to have a will to make it out you're going to have a will think on these things just think about it and then we'll just quit see I believe in one true and living God in Jesus is his name I believe that was almighty God walking on this Earth just as the Bible says you said what he prayed to the father uh do you pray do you pray who you pray to be careful yeah right it looks like you're praying to yourself I told you if I ever get enough to where I can get enough you think I'm all of this out of the other but I want to go back to Genesis and bring the godhead out of there again one of these days and speak on some things he had to come to where he came to fulfill the scriptures but that was almighty God coming down to reveal himself to you and I and his death won't do you a bit of good until it's revealed his death never saved nobody are you listening show me one person his death saved well that's me no no I'm sorry you believed it you had to accept it because he won't override your Fremont agency and make you be saved so you had to accept it yes but brother Dale you don't understand that big seed that I've had all I want to know what is the seed of God that's all I want to know that's all I've ever had riding up the road one day with a brother in the car and he was explaining all about this seed being I said Okay I want to ask you one question simple question is that seed in your body your spirit or your soul where's it at he said the sensible answer did anybody ought to say you know what he said I ain't gonna say I said because you ain't gonna say cause you don't know he said I'm just not going to comment that's a good answer at least he had no sense to say that but listen Church one true and living God what do we think about that and to think that he hung on that cross and he simply just stepped out of that body the Bible says the spirit went to God who gave it the Bible says the prophet says what his soul went to hell to preached to the souls in prison said his soul and let's see him if I get it wrong now you put it he said his Spirit was released and come to his soul and his soul back to his body and he raised up who's standing there but you see that live exited out of that body and that body died but it didn't rotten but it died a person with a baptism when the Holy Ghost dies the body rots but the soul lives on even a sinner the soul lives on somewhere until the day of judgment but what are we doing you see that's the Christ that's the God that I talk about that's the one that I know and for surety that he's God not a second person now let me just finish it by this if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the life of God you agree you agree the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the life of God living in you then you're not a second person no no you're going too far no I ain't went far enough sorry he went far enough at least you know what I believe nobody can't say that don't know why brother that's what he believes right but you see you ain't a second person your God manifested in flesh in the portion that you are he was God in the fullness but we're Sons and Daughters of God by the new birth and we're just a portion of God it takes all of us together we were talking about last night about the bride age everybody wants to preach about the bright age there was a bright age in every Church age if you listen to that you see every Church ain't had a bright age you know why go to never age the bride was called out of the age show me anywhere the prophet ever put the bride in an age come on I'm open here we are in Lady of Sia right who were called out run around and said to Pentecostal age is over but he never said the lady you'll see an age is over the lady you'll see an age goes right on over ties into the Millennium and there's even time in the Millennium 1000 years but he said Pentecost is done denominated and died now not the Holy Ghost Pentecost can't do that but the people who said cabbage down he said if I come let's see now make sure I get it right it's on the Feast of the trumpets you got it let me read it then where I want to make sure and miss it because if I misquote it then somebody said he didn't grow it around okay this is paragraph 64 Feast of the trumpets now if I come with a message of Pentecost I would be in the lady you'll see in the church age and it wouldn't be right it wouldn't be right he said because he wasn't the messenger to Pentecost did you see a book and you get home read page 464. you got the new one I'll probably find that in for you somewhere but just remember the prophet said no Messenger to the age because the Holy Ghost came himself in the fullness of the baptism when he said as it ended up on every age then the messenger came I've heard people in advance stood right here one time and preached and said Luther was false Wesley was false and Pentecost was false I had already showed him where brother random said that before we came here but that didn't do a bit of good to reading what brother random said he just had his own way of saying it and he said it the Holy Ghost came himself on the death Pentecost of Zeus's Street that's what your Prophet said he said a prophetic Prophet come down a prophetic well that's right around no sorry keep on reading the holy ghost that fell on Azusa Street was the baptism of the Holy Ghost the prophet came on Azusa Street then when brother random come along you just stepped right on over into him to finish the age you see that away Church we've got a wonderful beautiful message to believe to believe in an eternal God one that can keep his word think on these things because that's my way of saying of what I believe well you're just too stubborn there's no good to come and talk to you I'm glad you think that you know what because I am stubborn don't come to me with ceceified petty little doctrines and expect me to swallow it because brother so and so said it I don't care what brother so-and-so said I believe what wrote around him said bring me any quote in contrary from the prophet of what I've taught and I want to see it is that being sarcastic arrogant hateful hey I'm all of them because this church wasn't built folks on the basis of trying to be some pettified ceceified little doctrinal idea the first message I preached in this building wait a minute might have been at my house first message I preached comparing us as a church was going Beyond man's camp that's the title of it you remember right around and said going Beyond man's Camp remember the message I took the thought and I said then I said you people will ever hear this message don't fall out of that with us about what we're doing you can camp do what you want to but we're going Beyond man's camp we're going to walk in God's word and that way then you can't put me in these camps brother now you're in one of them two Souls seventh anniversary you may say he's an old stubborn goats in his own camp that's all right with me it's all right as long as I'm in the right camp don't worry about it you understand but now listen we said we're going to change the way we were doing things and we're gonna have a part now so the brothers are going to cut the internet system because in the tapes and we will have it taped though and videoed the word that you can watch them but they're only for our personal use all right not to be sent out to the world or anything because they're just going to cut the internet off and we're going to have up here we're going to have our Christmas time you know and you know to me now this time is the greatest time
