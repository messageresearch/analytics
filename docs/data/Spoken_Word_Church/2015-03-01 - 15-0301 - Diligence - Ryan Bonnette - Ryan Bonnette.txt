TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you like me talking right now I'm having to think of a thought and I can't just transmit it to youall I have to use words it has to come from here into words and to try to state in a way yall will understand it that's right and then y'all have to listen to it and not think about the color time wearing or not think about what you're going e for lunch not get distracted by all these other things you have to listen to it and then there's also you can misinterpret what I'm saying so there's a lot of barriers there's a lot of primitive ways of our communicating in in the form that we're in but yet it's the way that God chose for us to receive him back before he was descended condescended into locost who's going to understand that you know there's absolutely no way for us to for anybody to receive the Revelation or understanding of such a great big God in that form so he had to come down and with that in that locost that Revelation form or that condescending form of god father and son if you will in that sun form also I believe came language and he began to uh and he gives us a free language so that when you grow up and reate accountability you can begin to receive God through that because faith comes by hearing right and hearing by the word and you know I think the Bible refers to it as the foolishness of preaching I'm not sure why I guess it was Paul that said the foolishness of preaching see I think it's kind of like I said primitive it's foolishness this idea of make thinking of a thought instead of just zapping it into your head I have to come up with words to try to express it God is so far Supreme and so far beyond that and you know brother Dell and many ministers stand up there A lot of times and say I wish I could just you know basically open your head and pour pour in the thought because all this this foolishness of talking to try to get you to see what I'm saying it's so difficult and but yet that's that's the way that we have to receive God but God opened that way when he gives a baby a free language as an infant they seem so you know lacking in their IQ and yet they're learning a language that's got to be a miracle because any one of us in here to tries to learn second language it's hard sure but yet it seems like they just pick it up like they don't even think about it MH and I believe that's God absolutely opening away and he even gives it to a baby before they reach the stage of accountability so they can begin to receive bits and pieces along the way before they get to that point it could just let us wait till we're already at that age where we have to make the decision and then later on in life say oh by the way here's some language so you can begin to receive me no he begins to let them have language as a baby so that their parents can teach them the bible teach them Bible stories and teach them things about God and they can begin to contemplate and then when they come to the age of accountability where they know right and wrong and they can begin to choose the right or wrong they can make their own choice then the freedom all ages so you know I think it's just phenomenal and it's miraculous and it's something I think we Overlook but I believe that came out of and I'll have to you know talk to Brother D about that I should have talked to him first before I brought that out but anyway the the point is that I believe with that logos with that ability to understand God came language and are that's an attribute they brought that out yeah you know he brought that attribute out of us speaking and getting from what somebody spoke yeah and so where would we be though if we didn't have language just think about that I mean like I don't know if they really were cavan but let's just say we were cavan all we could do is you know basically eat and sleep you point to a bed I want to sleep point to a meal I want to eat you could even think about receiving God everything that we get about God comes through reading the Bible reading words language and comes through hearing the ministers preach Faith coming by hearing and listening to sermons where will we be without language you know and anyway so I guess that's all I was going to say about that yes I had an experience one time my brother he's very he's very good person he he's very good whatever Church of God or whatever he is and uh I I've talked to him about the message and he said well do y'all believe in speaking in tongues and I said well yeah I said but we don't believe it's the evidence well they do and he said well we believe that you have to speak tongues before you get the Holy Ghost and I and I it had to be God because I never thought of that before but I said Jerry I said do you think God respect her person he said oh no said the Bible says he's not and I said what about a deaf and dumb person that can't talk how they going to get the Holy Ghost if they got to speak in tongues to get it and you know he has never mentioned what we believe or nothing never again but he knew I was right you know I got him that on that one but he's never talked to me about this m and that's been years ago yeah but that's true true like you said to the little boy in the wheelchair I mean you know if you got to do something to get something God's a respector person exactly brother ban said even a illiterate person could be saved I was just thinking to add to what you were so that you could think about this because I was told years ago that it's better for a young child to learn a second language than it is it's easier for them to pick it up and when our last child was in kindergarten he started his Spanish and he had the accent he could roll those RS and you know I I think and I don't know why that is but young people have an easier time we need to teach the little kids new languages and not the the older ones yeah I believe it's the way God's engineered us as children they're in that one little window in our lives we can receive languages maybe even multiple languages little ones don't have all this up stuff at book Speak span you got everything else you it may fall under B law but does desire come under that same diligence you understand the question desire does come under diligence under Bob's law the more you take in just the desire oh I think the desire increases yeah for sure because then you begin to get rep God begins to give you Revelation and the goodness of God lead you to repentance little handfuls of purpose along the way Revelations little bit bitty things that make you desire more of God think the makes you well either way question because you can be lacking desire but you stay with it you have to kind of step out in faith when you're not when you don't desire when you don't desire that much of God and you just leap you know take a leap of faith or you step out and say God I'm going to commit this to you this a little bit of time to you and then he'll reward it and then you say well that worked good so I'll do it again it even more but um as you say in about language I think God have accents to because it might be silly but he will talk to me the language might have to okay good morning good morning is there a PowerPoint looking thing down there that it yeah that's it okay I gave it away sorry that was so yall know what we were talking about but yall already saw it I bet it's diligence it might be be a surprise okay let's pray de Heavenly Father we ask you to bless all that is done today Lord Lord bless us in the Sunday school and in the service us today just anoint brother B's lips to speak and I Ur to hear and I pray that you'll continue be with brother W ministering there in the Philippines all the other requests that we've been lifting up to you Lord Brother Homer Frasier and all those other ones Lord that have been mentioned here lately uh pray you'll help me with the teaching of the Sunday school and just help me to say something to edify and to encourage other believers here I pray we love you and thank you for all your blessings in Jesus name amen now we're going to talk about Thomas C shortly right now we're going to talk about diligence one of my favorite topics so diligence means haste with haste earnestness diligence earnestness and accomplishing promoting or striving after anything to give all diligence interest oneself most earnestly so want to talk about why it's important how you get it and a lot of other things about diligence so first off why is diligence important why do we need diligence it's because we're born lazy we're born slothful right nobody is Born Into the world with just you know desire to just work and strive and push we have to make ourselves do it and if you're going to accomplish anything in life and be successful at anything you have to be diligent okay whether it be serving the lord or in a marriage or in parenting or anything you have to be diligent it's natural to seek pleasure and to seek worldly things not necessarily bad things I'm talking about just things that are more pleasing to the flesh it's more natural to do those things it's not natural to be diligent so it's something you have to desire and you have to strive for okay like seeking and studying the things of God those things don't come naturally it's against our nature you know so our objective is to see that God always rewards diligence and that your efforts are never in vain because part of the reason we don't be diligent some of the time is because we don't feel like there's enough reward you know we don't feel like you know if I if I go out on a lamb and I try to serve the Lord what's in it for me you know what's what good is in it for me so you have to see a value in it sure and we'll talk more about that here in a little bit but our efforts at anything that you pursue in life seems futile or seems useless if you don't see a reward if you don't see something that you will accomplish and you don't see the value in it so God always rewards diligence our natural tendency is to give up when we don't see results quickly however those who are successful at anything are diligent in their efforts okay um a level of perseverance also goes with diligence we should continue on our walk with God not to not expecting to see immediate results be the tortoise not the hair right slow and steady always wins the race I think of the tortoise and hair I think of brother Dale he's very slow and steady but he keeps going no matter what he never backs down he never lets off he keeps driving keeps pushing and we don't have any idea how bad he must feel sometimes up there you know with many things bothering his body and yet he keeps on striving and pushing and he never backs down that's been my theme in life is to don't ever stop don't back down don't don't let up on anything that's right don't quit just keep pushing keep striving no matter if you see results right away or not just keep keep going we always want instant gratification on anything but with God there's not instant gratification most of the time you have to really push and strive to see results so now the hair on the other hand he was the type that that he was complacent because he said well I've got this m look at my opponent you know I can beat him I'll s settle down here and take a nap I'll rest for a while I'll take a break then I'll strive a little bit for a while then I'll back down he's in and out up and down and it makes me think of a lot of the well we'll talk about it more later but a lot of people in the message are that way I feel like they've come into the message and they're waiting on that last seed to come in Waiting on a bus to pull up like brother Dell says waiting on something else to happen somewhere else and instead of realizing that hey I need to get myself ready I need to do all I can to get out of here and strive and push so we are to be the tortoise slow and steady always but never never never give up there are many examples of this in the Bible Noah worked diligently preparing the ark without wavering even against all adversity every believer in the Bible had some level of diligence we too must be diligent and perseverant in serving the lord uh Hebrews 11:6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him he sees your efforts that are done toward him in secret and he will reward thee openly and I think about ministers especially in this church ministers that study in secret and commit themselves to the Lord and what does what does God do he rewards them openly before all of us these ministers brother Bob brother Wade brother Dell and brother Lis and brother Aaron all of them stand up there and minister to us the things that the Lord's shown to them the Lord's rewarded their diligence with Revelation and they stand up and they can on that to us share with us their Revelation and so God will reward you openly when you study in secret in private and commit yourself to the Lord and frankly that's one of the benefits of being that church it's not just to hear the word not just to have the fellowship with one another but we edify one another and we encourage one another and seeing brother Bob stand up here and upstairs in in church and brother and brother Dale and like I said all the ministers here it inspires me to go study more that's the sermon I like is one that makes me think man I don't know anything I need to go sit down and study for a while I need to seek the Lord for a while you know rather than feeling like I've got this and I think everything's under control and I'm going to take it easy yeah right um all right regarding wisdom Proverbs 4:20 my son attend to my words incline thine ear unto my sayings let them not depart from Thine Eyes keep them in the midst of thine heart for they are life unto those that find them and health to all their flesh keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life okay and U so how do you become diligent I sort of touched on this a minute ago like I said it goes against our nature and as I said you have to see a value in something and this is something that all this time I've been misusing the scripture uh this particular one about addicting themselves to the ministry of the Saints I'll just get down with this verse I beseech you Brethren you know the house of stephanus that it is the first fruits of the and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the Saints and I looked that word up addicted in the strong concordance when I was fixing to use the scripture and it actually means ordained or appointed so in other words he's saying uh stephanus the the the house of stepanus these are people who had uh committed themselves to you know ministering to the Saints but I look at it like this also I look at it and considering that I need to addict myself to the 5f ministry addict myself to to listening to these ministers in this church okay I think we need to be committed to and addicted to the ministry so much to where that if we miss a service we go back and listen to it not just once but maybe multiple times like any addiction you have to have it it's something you have to it drives you and it pushes you and you have to have it you can't do without so even though I'm kind of taking that scripture out of context that's that's the way that I've been using that scripture is until I realized that it means something else so right but anyway you addict yourself to the fold Ministry my son Proverbs 21 my son if thou receive my words and hide my Commandments with thee so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom and apply thine heart to understanding yay if Thou criest after knowledge and liftest up thy voice for understanding if thou seekest her as silver and searches for her as for his treasures and I'll finish that scripture in a minute I'm going to interject this seek Godly wisdom in the same manner that you work diligently for worldly riches perhaps our daily laboring for money can be looked at as an example of how we should also diligently search for Godly wisdom which is of much greater gain than worldly riches I go to work every day I show up early leave late and work hard while I'm there all just to make a living for my family but I think you know God lets us have examples like that in our lives to to help us see him better and how we should serve him that's the same way we have to serve the Lord you know come to church and and read our Bible make ourselves available to him and you know be diligent about serving God in the same way that we would work for worldly riches that's right and he in the rest of that scripture then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God for the lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding he layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous he is a to them that walk uprightly yes okay and Proverbs 104 he becometh poor that deal with a slack hand but the hand of the diligent maketh Rich so the word Rich does not only refer to Natural riches but those that are spiritual as well as in many Proverbs and Psalms there's natural and spiritual applications so naturally if you look at it that way you become poor to deal with a slack hand so if you if you don't work in the natural you'll become poor okay you'll be hungry and but also in the natural the hand of the diligent maketh Rich so you'll have what you have need of and and then some maybe if you if you're very diligent in the natural it's your job all right so in the spiritual he becometh poor that deal with a slack hand if you deal with god with a slack hand you'll become poor in Revelation you won't have any and and uh you won't have any of the fruits of the spirit you won't grow up the stature of a perfect man but the hand of the diligent if you're diligent with God he'll make you rich okay and you'll go up the stature of per man and you'll uh gain the fruits of the spirit and grow in God right now we're going to talk about Thomas con k I wasn't kidding about that so Thomas and his wife kette uh they wrote a book called The Many Loves of marriage and I thought there's some good things in there about diligence so I'm going to talk about those for a while and in that book he used this Proverbs 24 and this is Solomon I went by the field of the slothful and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding and lo it was all grown over with thorns and Nettles had covered the face thereof and the stone wall thereof was broken down then I saw and considered it well I looked upon it and received instruction I think it's God's grace to us that he sometimes lets us observe other people's faults and failures instead of letting us go through the thing and he let us observe it and then we gain instruction from that that still small voes speak to us I've observed a certain family member I won't name a certain family member of mine that I've observed over the years to made one mistake after another and I've just said and it hurts me to watch him fall and fail so much but yet at least you know I'm observing from a distance and saying well God show me what's what's wrong with this picture picture so I don't fall in that same trap right so here Solomon was looking at this man who was obviously slothful and now what is a Vineyard it's his livelihood where he gathers his food from and his substance and his uh you know makes the living off of and he was slothful about it so it was as Solomon was saying it was uh grown over with thorns Nettles the wall stone wall was broken down it was just uh backsliding okay because he was sful so uh Thomas and CIS is his word Solomon had the kind of mind that was always asking why and how why had this collapse taken place how had this small wedge of God's Promised Land fallen on such hard times he thought about it perhaps sitting on a rock or standing beside that crumbling wall the great king took it all to heart I applied my heart to what I observed and learned a lesson from what I saw and what did he learn a little sleep a little Slumber a little folding of the hands to rest and poverty will come on you like a bandit and scarcity like an armed man I'm not sure what version that is but we know what it says though King James all right decay occurs in small increments with a devastating cumulative effect kind of like the snow up in the Northeast you know the New England area I don't know if y'all heard about like hundreds of roofs collapsed on people's houses because snow as light as it is if you hold a snowflake in your hand it's so tiny it's almost weightless but if there's millions of them accumulating on a roof of a house it'll collapse in and when it comes to Gardens Vineyards and the relationship between a husband and wife it doesn't take much neglect to bring poverty and loss to your own front door and then this is Nanette his wife my parents would often remind me that the first rule of gardening is diligence you just just have to be there every day to water to weed to prune to fertilize to guard against invading armies of aphids caterpillars spiderm snails and a host of other Relentless enemies without such VI vigilance the only Gardens anyone would ever see would be the two-dimensional kind in one of Thomas's paintings in other words you just see pictures of Dino Gardens it's the same in a marriage unless you're watchful actively cultivating the relationship working at it with wide open eyes and an inent of heart it will begin to fall into ruin just a little sleep a little Slumber a little folding of the hands in other words it doesn't take very long for a garden to go to see or to die just a little bit of compromise a little bit of selfishness a little bit of a ho hum attitude and that place of Duty and refuge begins to crumble right before or right before your eyes Thorns everywhere the ground covered with weeds the stone wall and ruins marriage is just as much an action as a state of being it's a verb not just some sleepy noun that collects dust and rust it's a consuming ongoing activity it is life itself I've had friends tell me well it's sad but my marriage just fell apart they speak as if it were something inevitable and unavoidable as someone might say it rained last night or that last earthquake cracked our foundation but it isn't so we are not passive victims of circum St no matter what our warp self-absorbed culture may say you know everybody says today everybody's always talking about I'm a victim I'm a victim of our government I'm a victim of the U you know getting the money call it economy being bad okay I'm a victim of this I'm victim of that I can't the little man can't the little man can't get a head you always hear people say yeah that's a victim mentality okay and uh when in reality it's I think it's an excuse to be lazy for a lot of people if they just get up and do uh something diligent you know just work and strive and struggle and push they wouldn't accomplish the same things that you know doctors and lawyers and all the very accomplished people have accomplished it's a law of God is what it goes down to the law called diligence he says he didn't even say it's just for Christians God's laws work for non-christians as well if they would just commit and be diligent about something just commit to something then you'd be successful in it eventually um awesome place okay could you imagine hearing a professional Gardener say sigh deeply and say something like this well you know it's so unfortunate but my garden that little half acre I've worked on for years suddenly failed I walked outside yesterday morning and would you believe it it was all overgrown the place was chest high with weeds and aphids were chewing up everything inside it really gets me down and you'd have to say friend Where Have You Been was your garden really that important to you after all or did you just tell yourself it was where have you been pouring your time where have you been devoting your energies and your creativity beautiful gardens don't go to Sea overnight and neither do once loving marriages one of the many loves of marriage is a diligent attentive love that refuses to ignore those little things that keep Love In Full Bloom someone once said that it's a little it's the little things that determine the big things just think of the daily that takes place on Bo 747 little screws tightened little levers oiled little fuel lines checked little instruments calibrated why because if one more of those small things is neglected a jumbo jet could suddenly fall out of the sky in the same way small areas of neglect can do uncountable damage to a marriage one researcher asks the question how does a couple get from a fight about washing dishes to Legal arguments in divorce for it's the Snowball Effect again I was talking about snow a while ago how it accumulates on a roof builds and builds and builds until it finally is devastating when little things that couples fight about aren't properly dealt with they can develop into larger problems how couples manage the small stuff may be a key factor in whether they achieve long-term conjugal bliss all that's all that Proverbs 134 the soul of the sluger desireth and haveth nothing but the soul of the diligent shall be made fast again think of the natural and spiritual applications on both of these the thoughts uh Proverbs 215 the thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness but of everyone that is Hasty only to one now we are for free moral agents we get to choose whether we are diligent or slothful it's our choice we get to make the decision on that and we can be influenced by one way or another but we make the ultimate decision yes so and I just wrote this foolish virgins sit down and wait they sit and wait wise virgins work and endure there's a difference between being patient and waiting you know patient you can be working and striving and pushing to grow in God and be yet patient waiting on God to fulfill the promises while you're not just sitting and waiting that's right you know there's a there's a lot of people I think in the message that I've observed that are just literally sitting and waiting you see it in their lives they're not striving for anything they're not pushing they're not trying to go on with God that all right there is a level of perseverance and patience that goes along with having diligence you must be determined perseverant to make it through and patiently endure to obtain the promise okay and I'm going read some quotes of this is from the message perseverance in 62 or 218 now perseverance to be perseverant to try to make a goal trying to you've got your mind set on something and you're persistent in it because you believe it's the thing that you want and you believe you can get it now pardon me to be persistent you've got your mind made up now that what you're going to do now you cannot have faith in God without knowing the word of God or knowing something about God that's right right and also another perseverance message in 62520 then I got to thinking on perseverance and I thought yes many a man is perseverant before you can be perseverant you have to have faith in what you're trying to achieve you've got to First have faith before you can be perseverant so faith and perseverance Works hand in hand together they are brothers You Must Believe or you'll have no you have no confidence you won't know whether you're right or wrong but when you have reached that place that you have faith in what you're going and what you're trying to do then you can be persevering and uh let's see perseverance back the one back in on May 20th uh she was persistent she stayed all day the Undertaker's calling for her baby oh this is about the lady that was had her baby die that morning brother R prayed for the baby that evening and revive uh she was P persistent she stayed all day the Undertaker calling for a baby she stayed all day anyhow the Usher trying to keep her out of line and she stayed anyhow turned down every way she stayed why she had first why Faith caught a hold Faith said it's so and Faith knows no difficult Faith knows no defeat when you got faith you have perseverance and then uh from the 0218 uh sometimes Faith makes you act ridiculous to the carnal mind but if God's word if it's God's word it's got to come to pass be perseverant see God make it come to pass now Joshua 22:5 but of heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the Lord charged you to love the Lord your God and to walk in all his ways and to keep his Commandments and to cleave unto him and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul okay I got to head myself on these notes while I go so I'll Skip One Note here uh I think I've got time for a brief story this is something that God dealt with me and uh years ago y'all know we go to Kentucky pretty often and the way we do it is when I get off work on a Friday I come home whatever time it is and get ready and then we leave and go up there and then we stay for the weekend and come back home Sunday night well several years ago there was a boy at brother Dani gon D Church dating one of Gabby's sisters in Kentucky so he was going to ride with us up to Kentucky for the weekend to visit with her so I got off work came rushing home and trying to hurry up and get ready and Gabby was slowing me down and saying you know what uh Jacob's not here yet the boy's name is Jacob he was going to ride with us she said Jacob's not here yet you can calm down take your time slow down and I said you know what when he comes if I'm not ready we're not going so I've got to get ready too cuz I was a long ways away from being ready so uh the point is this God began to deal with me on that and I began to see an example of a spiritual problem in the message that where again the last seed syndrome I guess where so many people are sitting and waiting for that last seed to come in not realizing that if that last seed comes in and I'm not ready we're not going so the point is don't sit down be diligent keep striving and pushing because when he does come or she whoever that last seed is if we're not ready then we're not going they might come in and get ready and then we're still getting ready MH so and it's funny because we go up north to Kentucky so we're waiting on that last seed to come in so we could go up in that example good story thank you so put this law of God call diligence to work for you for it is God's word and cannot fail be diligent in your marriage relationships with family and friends and your finances and your health and above all in your relationship and walk with our Lord he is ever faithful and will not let your diligence go unnoticed but will reward your efforts bountifully yes now I'm going to revert back again I think I may mention this before but you know brother Bob mentioned a long time ago he said I made a little Discovery quote unquote little discovery that the more I study and read and pray and seek the Lord the more I grow and you think well duh but that's not really that common sense you really have to strive and TR yourself before you really come to see that that's really true so Bob's little discovery I've named it Bob's law it's actually not Bob's law it's God's law but there's really a lot of truth to it and it's really good God's law of sewing and reaping is what it is you get out of something what you put into it that's right you get out of your relationship with God what you put into it that's right okay objective review so do you see that God always rewards diligence and that your efforts are never in vain that's my last slide is that clock fast or slow you started early I started too early okay well let's see I've got something here that has nothing to do with this subject the only reason I wrote it down is cu when I was studying the other night I started thinking about this so I'll mention it to y'all and I don't know if I want to just read it all or just tell you hang on a minute just start just start just start I might say anything um all right brother Dell has been preaching about the low Goos that came down out of God right the great Elohim that dwelt alone with all his attributes all botted up in him and how can anybody understand that that's been one of my favorite things about what brother benam talked about is that logos condescending from God God condescending to another form so we can begin to understand him and I got to think about the other day have y'all ever thought about that babies learn a language and how uh miraculous that is that an infant with as little IQ as they have and little ability as they have get a free be everybody gets a free language besides you know mental retardation certain circumstances that hinder and deformities and things which you know I believe those people I know somebody in Kentucky a young fell that's in a wheelchair has been confined to a wheelchair it's whole life and he's probably 18 I've know him I guess since he was about eight and he's always been in wheelchair he doesn't hardly really speak anything he's he never really learned to speak and his parents will probably be taken care of him until the day he dies or until they they die then give him off to somebody else well people like that are special and they will be I I believe given a free way to heaven cuz God didn't give them any way to receive him so he wouldn't be just to send them to hell because they passed the age of accountability and didn't get saved you know so but people like that aside from those cases you think of a baby been learning I've been trying to learn Spanish for over a decade I started in high school I didn't really care about it I just had to take a a language class of some sort so I chose Spanish because I thought what use is French those are the only two choices we had and I was like I don't know many French people so I'll learn Spanish and SE any so I tried to learn some Spanish but I didn't really commit myself to it so I came through two semesters of that just knew the basics and that was it just enough to pass and then years later I started uh working with a lot of Hispanics and so I gradually learned one word here and one word there and finally recently I got some Spanish CDs and started really committing myself to trying to learn Spanish to become fluent I'm still not fluent but I've learned a lot but yet I began to realize how hard it is to learn language as a 30-year-old man it's hard it's taking me years to try to learn Spanish a second language but I picked up English you know just without even really trying and there's IA she doesn't really speak much of anything yet but in by the time she's four years old she'll be fluent in English you know the point is this God made a way for us to receive him and I believe with that logos when when that logos came out of God there was Speech there was Revelation there was you know an ability for man to begin to understand God but what else was with that was and
