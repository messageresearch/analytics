[7:32] morning.
[7:33] Has he been good to you?
[7:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even when the things happen that
[7:38] we don't understand, that's still the
[7:39] goodness of God. You just have to look
[7:41] through it through the eyes of grace.
[7:43] Amen. If he's been good to you this
[7:45] morning, just shake one another hand and
[7:47] greet him in the name of the Lord Jesus
[7:49] as we sing that chorus once more. Oh,
[7:52] God is good
[7:54] all the time.
[7:57] He put a song of praise in this heart of

[8:13] will shine. God is good.
[8:16] Oh, God is good
[8:20] all the time.
[8:23] Hallelujah.
[8:25] Amen.
[8:27] Praise the Lord.
[8:29] &gt;&gt; I want to say it's good to see everyone
[8:31] here.
[8:32] &gt;&gt; You know, we um there's going to be
[8:34] seasons where we don't have all the
[8:35] support here with the media and that's
[8:37] probably why you don't see the lyrics up
[8:38] here. Did everybody bring their Bible
[8:40] this morning?
[8:42] &gt;&gt; Okay, cuz there going to be times where
[8:44] you need that physical book. And so, if
[8:46] you have your Bible this morning, let's
[8:48] let's always bring our Bibles cuz I tell
[8:50] people, don't rely on these screens a
[8:52] lot of times. you know, we got to rely
[8:54] on that that word, right? So, let's sing
[8:57] a little chorus while brother um Donnie
[8:59] comes up here. And I forgot my Bible in
[9:01] the back. I don't even have it up here.
[9:04] Um I usually bring it. So, I'm kind of
[9:06] looking around. See if there was one I
[9:08] can grab somewhere. But, uh let's just
[9:10] sing that chorus. Um can't you see while
[9:13] I'm happy? Are you happy this morning?
[9:17] Even if you're sad, even if you're going
[9:18] through depression or something, a
[9:21] valley, you know, Brother Brandham and
[9:23] and go look this up in in in the
[9:25] message.
[9:27] There's there's a quote that I print out
[9:28] and I I put it on the refrigerator.
[9:30] Brother Brham said, "God made the heart
[9:32] to be happy. He didn't make it to be
[9:36] sad. He made it to be happy." And he
[9:38] says, "All the grief, all the anxiety,
[9:40] all the depression, it just brings
[9:43] physical problems to your body."
[9:45] And so when I go through that, I have to
[9:47] sit down and say, "Lord, let me start
[9:49] thinking about what is my blessings in
[9:51] life. If your family, you're my family,
[9:55] my spiritual family, and a lot of you
[9:57] just closer than my natural family." And
[9:59] that makes me happy. That makes me happy
[10:01] that I can come to a place and serve God
[10:04] in spirit and in truth and know that
[10:06] you're going to be there and serve him
[10:07] with me. And that's a blessing. If
[10:09] there's any happiness, it's all in him.
[10:12] That's where the joy of the Lord is.
[10:14] So think about that if you're going
[10:16] through times, regardless of what the
[10:18] situation is, there's always a place you
[10:20] can be grateful for and thank God and
[10:23] say, "Thank you, Lord, for making me
[10:24] happy." That's part of just speaking it
[10:26] by faith, right? You got to speak things
[10:28] by faith. And uh God's here to make us
[10:32] happy in him and know that all is well.
[10:34] Amen. Amen. Can't you see
[10:40] why
[10:42] I'm so happy?
[10:47] Oh, I've accepted
[10:50] the word
[10:53] of the Lord
[10:55] is that revealed word.
[10:58] The revealed
[11:01] word
[11:03] that was spoken
[11:09] by the prophet
[11:12] of Malach.
[11:18] Oh, and can't you see?
[11:23] Why
[11:25] I'm so happy?
[11:31] I've accepted,
[11:33] accepted the word
[11:36] of my Lord.
[11:39] was the revealed word, the revealed
[11:44] word
[11:46] that was spoken
[11:52] by the prophet
[11:55] of Malachi
[11:58] 4.
[12:01] Amen. Let's give them all a hand. Thank
[12:04] you, Lord, for just getting us here this
[12:06] morning safely.
[12:08] and uh hope with happy hearts come to
[12:10] receive. I always had a thing that if I
[12:13] miss church, God was going to something
[12:16] from this pull pit that I needed to get
[12:18] through. And I was afraid I was going to
[12:20] miss it if I wasn't here.
[12:22] &gt;&gt; I don't know if anybody else feels that
[12:24] way, but I do.
[12:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:25] &gt;&gt; I feel like if I ain't here to hear the
[12:27] word, then how can I become the word?
[12:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[12:31] &gt;&gt; And I mean, he plainly tells you you got
[12:33] to be here to get it. That's right.
[12:35] &gt;&gt; So, that being said, we're going to read
[12:37] in Psalm 67 this morning. I'll take it.
[12:41] It's not on the screen, is it? Okay.
[12:42] Well, that's okay. That's good. It's a
[12:44] short one. But we're blessed. It's God's
[12:47] word. So, let's uh as you get your
[12:49] Bibles, everybody, when you get ready,
[12:51] just let me know. We'll
[12:54] we'll thank him for it
[12:59] as we go to the Lord in prayer this
[13:00] morning. Precious heavenly father, we
[13:02] thank you for this day you've given us
[13:04] to come and gather around your word one
[13:05] more time, Lord. That one day on earth
[13:07] and marking time here, Father, that
[13:09] you've given us to dwell in, but one day
[13:11] it won't be so. We'll be dwelling in
[13:14] eternity.
[13:16] You know, there's Father, so many times
[13:19] I get a little low about things or you
[13:21] don't speak to me right off the bat,
[13:23] kind of spoil me with all these things
[13:24] you've given me, Lord God, and showing
[13:26] me. And I appreciate it, Father. And
[13:29] thank you for all the trials that I've
[13:31] went through too, Lord. That you brought
[13:32] me right through them unscathed. And I
[13:34] thank you, Father. I'd ask that you just
[13:37] forgive me of my sins. Forgive everybody
[13:39] here of their sins, Lord, today. Cleanse
[13:41] us all, Father. And Father, just have
[13:43] your way with us. I'd ask, Lord, that
[13:46] those that are not here today, forgive
[13:48] them, Lord. Whatever it is that's kept
[13:50] them away, that they couldn't come
[13:53] through the door, you just bless it,
[13:54] Lord, and bring the ones back that
[13:56] belong here, Father. cuz I know that's
[13:58] the only thing you can do. You would
[14:00] bring everybody if you could. But Lord,
[14:02] you just you said that by your stripes
[14:04] we're healed. And I believe your word
[14:05] and that healing don't only go for the
[14:07] flesh, but it's the spiritual that
[14:09] causes the healing within us, Lord. And
[14:11] it's your word that we get that comes
[14:13] down in there that comes alive that
[14:15] gives us that birth, Lord, that makes us
[14:17] you, Father. To have the mind of Christ
[14:19] is a mighty thing, Lord. And let us use
[14:22] it wisely, Father. Don't ever let us say
[14:24] anything or do anything to harm or
[14:25] hinder anybody. and those that couldn't
[14:27] be here today. Forgive them, Lord, for
[14:29] their sins. And just be with them and
[14:30] bless them in their time of trouble. And
[14:33] Father, thank you for letting us be
[14:35] here. And also, Father, we thank you for
[14:37] Brother Wade being here today. It's
[14:38] going to bring your word to us, Lord.
[14:40] And we just ask you just to bless him
[14:41] and let him get out of the way, Father,
[14:43] when he comes down to speak about you.
[14:46] We ask now, Father, that all that's said
[14:48] in here today all points to you and the
[14:50] glory of you, Lord. The things you've
[14:53] done for us. Now, as we go to your word,
[14:55] Father, return unto us the joy of thy
[14:58] salvation
[14:59] most of all. And we thank you for
[15:01] Calvary. We ask these things in your
[15:03] precious name, Jesus Christ. Amen.
[15:12] Is everybody ready?
[15:16] &gt;&gt; God be merciful unto us and bless us and
[15:19] cause his face to shine upon us. Sila
[15:25] earth.
[15:29] &gt;&gt; Let the people praise thee, oh God. Let
[15:32] all the people praise thee.
[15:45] &gt;&gt; Let the people praise thee, oh God. Let
[15:48] all the people praise thee.
[15:51] the earth.
[15:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[15:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. God shall bless us and all ends of
[16:01] the earth shall fear him. Thank you so
[16:04] much. And you may be seated.
[16:11] Amen. Hallelujah.
[16:15] I have an assignment for you. How many
[16:17] knows what the word ceila means?
[16:21] if you don't go look it up. I think um
[16:23] Sophia, we were reading the Psalms one
[16:25] day. She who is Ceila.
[16:28] So that's your assignment. That's, you
[16:30] know, there's a lot of words in there
[16:32] that that are spoken that has a meaning.
[16:34] Every word has a meaning in God's word.
[16:37] Amen. Brother Kern, would you come this
[16:39] morning and take up the offering?
[17:29] Amen. Um we have our uh Sunday school
[17:33] Christmas program this morning. So we're
[17:35] going to sing just one more song and
[17:36] then have them come out. And I hope you
[17:39] enjoyed it. you know, our Sunday school
[17:40] teachers, they put a lot of effort to um
[17:43] really uh go through these songs with a
[17:46] coordination with the kids and and so
[17:49] just just be in the moment and and ask
[17:52] God to speak to you um through what they
[17:54] do. It's it's a blessing. And just want
[17:57] to just give a thanks to everyone. All
[17:59] the musicians, brother Donald's been
[18:01] here, Brother Onen, the ones that are
[18:02] out, brother Joseph, the soul leaders,
[18:04] brother Boyd, Brother Aaron, the
[18:06] different ones that you know are here
[18:09] when we can't be here. And even if we
[18:12] can't be here, they're still here to
[18:13] worship, right? Let God use the gift in
[18:16] your life to worship him. I tell you, it
[18:17] turns out to be a blessing. And um you
[18:21] know that's one thing we we uh treasure
[18:23] is to know that uh just like the path of
[18:25] Abraham, God can use you to be a
[18:28] blessing to others and he'll bless you.
[18:30] And when he blesses you, you go share
[18:32] that and be a blessing to others. And
[18:34] that's the way the spirit of the Lord
[18:36] works. So let's sing this course uh song
[18:38] before they come out. I've got my mind
[18:40] made up. I hope your mind is made up. If
[18:44] it's not, you hadn't got the mind of
[18:46] Christ yet. get his mind because once
[18:49] you're in his mind, there's no turning
[18:51] back. Amen. You've you found that that
[18:55] thirst quencher. And that's what we're
[18:57] here today to confess. I've got my mind
[19:01] made up and I won't turn back cuz I
[19:06] won't see my Jesus someday.
[19:11] I've got my mind made up and I won't
[19:15] turn back cuz I want to see my Jesus. So
[19:20] let's sing that again. I've got my mind
[19:24] made up and I won't turn back. I won't
[19:30] see my Jesus someday.
[19:34] I've got my mind made up and I won't
[19:39] turn back. Want to see my Jesus today.
[19:44] Oh, can you give him a wave offering?
[19:46] Goodbye world.
[19:49] Oh, I stay no longer with you. Goodbye
[19:53] pleasure of sin. I stay no longer with
[19:57] you. I've made up my mind. Go God's way
[20:01] the rest of my life.
[20:04] I made up my mind. Go God's way the rest
[20:08] of my life.
[20:10] I've got my mind made up and I won't
[20:15] turn back because I won't see my Jesus
[20:20] someday. Won't ask a Sunday school class
[20:22] to come ahead made up and I won't turn
[20:27] back.
[20:29] Won't you see my Jesus someday? Let's
[20:33] sing that again. I've got my mind made
[20:37] up and I won't turn back cuz I want to
[20:42] see my Jesus someday.
[20:46] Oh, I got my mind made up and I won't

[21:06] pleasures of sin. Cuz I stay no longer
[21:10] with you. I made up my mind to go God's
[21:13] way the rest of my life.

[21:20] rest of my life. Hallelujah. Amen.
[21:25] Praise the Lord.

[26:28] is born.
[26:36] Silent
[26:38] night,
[26:40] holy
[26:42] night,
[26:44] son of God,
[26:50] your life
[26:56] from my holy face.
[27:00] Then
[27:02] dawn I
[27:06] praise
[27:08] Jesus.
[27:16] Jesus.
[27:51] Come away
[27:53] of nature. eternal
[28:02] Lord Jesus laid down his sweet
[28:08] thes.
[28:10] to the
[28:13] town where we
[28:19] Lord Jesus
[28:21] the We all
[28:31] the
[28:36] living
[28:41] Jesus
[28:45] name.
[28:47] I love you, Lord Jesus. Look down on the
[28:53] sky.
[28:55] And stay on my way till morning is
[29:11] Lord Jesus.
[29:16] You will find me in the
[29:23] I
[29:24] bless all the dear children
[29:29] in thy tender
[29:35] for heaven to live with me.
[32:19] If you can't see yourself
[33:43] Can't see.
[37:16] all at the same time. So when you have
[37:19] that all the same
[39:45] Let's give him one MORE BIG HAND.
[39:51] I WAS UH looking back this morning on
[39:54] 2020 when we had the uh when we had it
[39:59] down at the uh Oh, turned on. when we
[40:02] had it at the um at the barn where we
[40:04] had our uh meal, we we had it down there
[40:06] one year and and man, everybody's grown
[40:09] up and and some of y'all got old,
[40:15] real old,
[40:17] but uh we had a good time and we we
[40:19] appreciate all the sisters that uh
[40:22] participated
[40:23] and got all this together
[40:26] because it's a group effort. It's a
[40:29] group effort to get all this done and
[40:31] and uh
[40:33] and get the kids together and we sure do
[40:35] appreciate him and uh we appreciate the
[40:38] season. Um we know we know that that
[40:43] Jesus wasn't born on Christmas day and
[40:46] we all know that but we still like the
[40:48] season. I like the season. Brother
[40:50] Brandham liked the season. So, I like
[40:53] the season because most time people are
[40:55] happy now and um and they're joy. It's a
[40:59] joyous time for I mean we might have 11
[41:02] months of other things but we maybe this
[41:04] month in December we can have a smile on
[41:06] our face and and a u have a happy time
[41:09] in the Lord. be your family, be with
[41:12] your like um brother uh said, this is
[41:16] this is this is my family and uh we sure
[41:20] do appreciate the Lord giving us a
[41:21] family,
[41:23] spiritual and and uh physical family
[41:27] because we're all one family as the
[41:30] bride of Jesus Christ and we're going to
[41:32] live together whether our natural family
[41:36] does or not. We know this spiritual
[41:37] family that God's building on earth, we
[41:40] will be together for an eternity.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we appreciate that. That God's
[41:46] going to give us something eternal.
[41:48] Not something temporal, but something
[41:50] eternal, something past all this that
[41:53] we'll have a a Christmas day, every day
[41:55] for an eternity. We'll be we've been
[41:58] given the gift of eternal life. That's
[42:01] the greatest gift there ever was is the
[42:03] gift of eternal life and which will take
[42:05] us into that other dimension. Bring us
[42:08] back here. We'll connect with our body
[42:10] and be glorified and then we can live
[42:12] for an eternity. We won't have to worry
[42:14] about worry about anything else. Worry.
[42:17] Can you imagine being somewhere without
[42:19] worrying about anything?
[42:22] Because today we're already worried
[42:24] about what's tomorrow's going to be or
[42:25] this afternoon or Wednesday or Tuesday.
[42:29] That's right.
[42:30] But we're going to go to a place we
[42:33] ain't got to worry no more.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; We don't have to worry about anything.
[42:36] But we got to we got to fight to get
[42:38] there.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; So, we're still going to fight the good
[42:41] fight of faith to get there. We're going
[42:43] to get there by the grace of God. We
[42:46] sure do appreciate all of you. The uh uh
[42:48] the Christmas party that we had Sunday.
[42:50] Uh we appreciate all of you. Appreciate
[42:52] the gifts and cards and and things from
[42:54] you and hope you appreciated your gifts.
[42:56] And um we um we're a church that dad's
[43:00] always had um that they were we we share
[43:04] um we share with the people because uh
[43:06] without you they wouldn't be a church.
[43:09] Amen. So we appreciate all of you. Love
[43:12] you with the love of the Lord. Thank you
[43:13] for the ones that that um uh play
[43:16] instruments and lead singing and all
[43:18] like brother Joe was saying that
[43:19] everybody's got a part to play. All
[43:21] right. So we sure do appreciate you.
[43:23] Brother Manuel will be speaking for us
[43:25] Wednesday
[43:27] and um that will be uh heading toward
[43:30] the Christmas holiday. The next
[43:32] Wednesday we will not have church
[43:34] service. That will be Christmas Eve. And
[43:37] then the next Wednesday night will be
[43:40] New Year's Eve. So we will have service
[43:42] then, but it'll start at 8 o'clock. And
[43:44] we've already got some flyers out uh to
[43:47] some of the local ministers and uh
[43:50] hopefully that some of them will be able
[43:51] to come. So, and we'll have brother
[43:54] Scott Smith with us uh during that time
[43:56] and brother Chris will be here the
[43:57] weekend before that. So, just keep those
[44:00] things in prayer. We've got a uh I pray
[44:02] that everybody is so far has had a good
[44:05] uh holiday and I know some of you are
[44:07] leaving. Brother uh Luis and his family,
[44:10] they're going to Canada and then the
[44:12] then the Canada are going to New Mexico.
[44:14] So I I just ain't got that down right.
[44:17] That I was starting to say different,
[44:19] but the Canada are going to New Mexico
[44:22] and the Ugos are going to Canada. So
[44:25] they'll be gone for a couple of weeks.
[44:26] So we'll pray for them as they as they
[44:28] journey along. So if you got your
[44:30] Bibles, let's turn to uh to First
[44:32] Corinthians and we'll continue our
[44:35] thought on the seals.
[44:38] I was thinking this morning that um
[44:43] the day the day that we walk out of
[44:46] here, we will say we are sealed.
[44:51] Okay? Body, spirit, and soul. Because
[44:53] the Bible tells us we're sealed until
[44:55] the day of our redemption. Okay? We're
[44:58] sealed in our soul. We're sealed until
[45:00] the day of our redemption. All right?
[45:03] So, that's what we got to see, though.
[45:04] We've got to see that we're sealed. As
[45:07] brother Ram tells us, and we'll read it
[45:08] later on, but not here, where Brother
[45:10] Rime tells us about the box car. You put
[45:13] the stuff in the box car. Well, when you
[45:15] put that stuff in the box car, you just
[45:16] don't throw it in there willy-nilly.
[45:18] You stack it up, right? You you pack it
[45:20] in so that there's no chinks, there's no
[45:24] cracks, there's nothing. And when you
[45:26] shut that door, that buddy, that thing
[45:28] is so tight, you barely get the door
[45:29] shut. But what happens is as that thing
[45:33] goes down the road of life,
[45:36] nothing shakes loose,
[45:39] &gt;&gt; and and we don't want anything to shake
[45:41] loose. We want God to pack it in there.
[45:43] And brother Brown was told in the vision
[45:45] to store up the food because the people
[45:47] would need it. Well, I believe we've had
[45:48] the food stored up and I believe we'll
[45:50] be able to eat it. So, we're sealed
[45:53] until the day of our redemption. Well,
[45:55] the day of our redemption will be full
[45:56] redemption when someone takes what the
[46:00] prophet said and the Bible said and
[46:02] lives it.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, 1 Corinthians 2:9.
[46:06] Dear heavenly father, Lord, thank you
[46:08] for this day you've gi us. Lord, be with
[46:09] us as we continue this service. You be
[46:12] the active participant.
[46:14] Lord, thank you for the program that we
[46:16] had. Lord, seeing the the the young men
[46:19] and women growing up from from babies.
[46:21] And father, thank you for coming here as
[46:24] a baby, but Lord, thank you so much for
[46:26] not staying a baby. Lord, you rose up
[46:29] and you lived with man and then they
[46:31] hung you on a tree at a very young age.
[46:34] But Father, I know that you you knew
[46:36] that was coming. They were going to do
[46:37] it to you, but you were doing it for us.
[46:41] Thank you for salvation. Thank you for
[46:44] what you've given, Lord. And I pray that
[46:46] you'd be with us today, Lord. be with
[46:47] the ones that are sick, especially be
[46:49] with brother Anderson. Lord, as as he's
[46:52] having some issues there with work and
[46:54] having we understand that there's times
[46:55] when when uh work is uh very important
[46:58] and we understand that, Lord, I pray
[47:00] that you'd help him, Lord, to do the
[47:02] right things. Father, be with the ones
[47:04] that are sick, Abby, and different ones.
[47:06] Lord, just be with them, take care of
[47:07] them. Be with the ones that are
[47:09] traveling, Lord, that are not here and
[47:11] the ones that are leaving in a few days
[47:13] that are traveling. Lord, I pray that
[47:14] you give them traveling mercies. Father,
[47:17] be with us in this season that we surely
[47:19] not forget that you are the reason for
[47:21] every season that we have. Lord, we
[47:24] thank you for all things. We ask your
[47:26] blessings in Jesus name. Amen. 1
[47:29] Corinthians 2:9. But as it is written, I
[47:32] hath not seen nor ear heard, neither
[47:35] have entered into the heart of man the
[47:37] things which God hath prepared for them.
[47:39] Now look, stipulation that love him.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; That love him. The world does not care a
[47:45] thing about him,
[47:47] but we do.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; So, if we love him, what's he going to
[47:51] do? He's going to reveal things to us
[47:53] that's never going to be revealed to
[47:55] anybody on the face of the earth except
[47:57] us.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; All right? You can call that being
[48:00] exclusive, whatever you want to call it.
[48:02] That's what God said he was doing. He
[48:04] was going to separate a group of people
[48:06] and he was going to give her the bride,
[48:08] his his wife. He was going to give her
[48:11] these certain things to what? To come to
[48:14] full maturity
[48:16] in your walk with God. All right. But
[48:20] God hath revealed them unto us. What? Us
[48:23] that love him by his spirit. For the
[48:26] spirit searches all things. Yay. The
[48:28] deep things of God. And if you look at
[48:30] that, the interpretation of that is even
[48:32] the inmost depths of God's being. You
[48:36] and I are the only people that really
[48:38] know who he is. what he is and where he
[48:41] is.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; All right? And that's what the seals
[48:43] tell us. Remember the seals tell us what
[48:45] what was before, what is now, and what's
[48:49] coming.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; All right? So So the same thing the
[48:52] three what what's here, what's here, and
[48:53] what's here. We have fully the book is
[48:56] open. We know what's going on. We know
[48:58] where he is because we're fixing to read
[48:59] here in in Matthew where Jesus is going
[49:02] to say, "Hey, they're going to say, "I'm
[49:04] over here." They're going to say, "I'm
[49:06] over here." They're going to say, and
[49:08] they're going to be false prophets.
[49:09] They're going to be prophets. They're
[49:10] going to be false prophets and say, "I'm
[49:12] here." But the only reason you're going
[49:13] to know is because you know he's inside
[49:16] of you.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; You may be seeing the Lord as his
[49:18] blessing of reading the word. And that's
[49:20] the whole thing. You will be deceived if
[49:23] the Holy Ghost is not in your soul.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; You're already deceived if the Holy
[49:29] Ghost is not in your soul.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; All right? All of us were. Even in times
[49:32] past, if we didn't have you didn't have
[49:34] the Holy Ghost, you were fooled and
[49:36] deceived. What happened to Eve? Eve had
[49:38] Eve was fooled and deceived.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, you and I become become the
[49:43] first birth that we had because of it.
[49:45] We're what? We're deceived.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; All right. So, we're just all in a
[49:49] deception until God comes and tells us,
[49:54] listen, no man can tell you you're
[49:55] wrong.
[49:58] No man can tell you you're wrong. I can
[50:00] sit up here all day and say, "You're
[50:02] wrong. You're wrong. You're wrong." The
[50:03] only way you're going to change is is
[50:05] for you to get that little tug inside
[50:07] your heart that says, "I'm wrong.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; I'm wrong." But it takes the foolishness
[50:14] of preaching to bring that out that God
[50:16] can talk to you and say, "Hey, I need to
[50:20] change. I'm wrong. There's something
[50:21] going on. There's something that I need
[50:23] to change." Well, when we start with
[50:25] these seals, the the the the the
[50:28] disciples that he had, the disciples,
[50:30] the 12, they were asking him certain
[50:32] questions. Well, they were as why why do
[50:35] you ask questions? Because you don't
[50:36] know the answer.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; All right? That's why you ask questions.
[50:39] That's why even the Bible tells us,
[50:41] we're talking about uh knowing the deep
[50:43] things of God because you have a
[50:45] question. If you don't want to know the
[50:47] deep things of God, God's a gentleman.
[50:49] He'll say, "Okay, not not a problem."
[50:51] But you will not live a full full
[50:55] redeemed life.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; And I know we're all going to have
[50:59] problems and we're all going to have
[51:01] trials. But my there's a place where you
[51:04] got to be settled to know that you know
[51:06] that you know that you know
[51:08] &gt;&gt; that God's in your soul. He's not just
[51:10] around you. He's in you.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Being around God
[51:15] is okay. But being with God and in God,
[51:19] there's where you need to be. Because
[51:21] remember, outside of being in him, you
[51:24] will be judged.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; By the word that you hear.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; But if you get that new birth, that new
[51:30] birth has already been judged. Praise
[51:32] the Lord. That new birth has already
[51:34] been judged. When he went to Calvary,
[51:36] what life left him?
[51:39] The Holy Ghost.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; The real Jesus. that theophony God went
[51:43] to hell, preached to hell, picked up the
[51:45] people in paradise, went up and what?
[51:48] Come back on the day of Pentecost as the
[51:50] Holy Ghost, as the theophony of God now
[51:52] spreading himself among a group of
[51:54] people so that he can work through them.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; Not just with them, through them. He
[52:02] said, but see, Jesus said, I'll be with
[52:04] you even in you till the end of the age.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Think about that.
[52:12] So, brother Ram tells us as then I
[52:13] mention that it takes the Holy Spirit to
[52:16] give us revelation or or what or we'll
[52:18] fail to get it. It'll pass us right by.
[52:21] We'll do like uh like brother Donnie
[52:23] said, you know, in in
[52:25] this is where I get it.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; This this is this is it. I mean, this is
[52:30] Listen, Brother Ramman, God's provided
[52:32] place of worship. He gives us a place to
[52:35] worship.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I know we're supposed to be
[52:38] worship every time, every time of the
[52:40] day, but you know as well as I do. You
[52:43] don't.
[52:44] Neither do I. Come on, be honest. You
[52:48] worship every day when you go down the
[52:49] road and somebody cuts you off and Well,
[52:51] anyway, so yeah, you worshiping
[52:54] something all right, but it's not the
[52:56] Lord. Yeah, exactly. Right. But now
[53:00] look, he said it's going to take the
[53:02] operation of the Holy Ghost. So to
[53:05] understand scripture, to understand even
[53:07] what brother Bram said, you got to have
[53:08] the Holy Ghost
[53:11] &gt;&gt; in your soul so that he can speak to you
[53:15] &gt;&gt; lip to ear.
[53:18] It's going to take the operation of the
[53:21] Holy Ghost. That means this book can't
[53:23] be revealed to anyone. Now here it is.
[53:25] But a special class of people. Remember
[53:27] brother Brandham said he said I'm He
[53:29] said I'm not for that segregationist out
[53:31] here. He said, "But God is a
[53:32] segregationalist."
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Everywhere. He told him, he said,
[53:35] "Israel, get away from that. This one,
[53:38] get away from that." And every time they
[53:39] mingled, they got into trouble. That's
[53:42] why we don't mingle with the world.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; We're in the world, but not of the
[53:46] world. That's why I need a recharging on
[53:49] Wednesday and a recharging on Sunday.
[53:52] Even myself, when I'm studying, I get a
[53:55] recharge to where all the smuddy things
[53:58] of the world and all that just kind of
[53:59] goes away.
[54:01] where you can talk to God because you
[54:03] know what? God's the only one that can
[54:05] get rid of them.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; You can't get rid of them any other way.
[54:09] Man has used all kind of things. You
[54:11] know, you got drugs, you got all these
[54:12] different things that people want to
[54:14] substitute, but you'll never find full
[54:16] satisfaction outside of Jesus Christ.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Never. You can search it. You can look
[54:22] for it. You can get a five minute feel
[54:24] for it, but somewhere you're going to
[54:27] come down. And when you come down off
[54:29] that natural high, you better have a
[54:31] spiritual high waiting on you.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; I get a spiritual high. I I I and I'll
[54:37] say this very very not lightly is I
[54:42] didn't I don't want to be a pastor.
[54:46] Brother Ram said if you wanted to be
[54:48] one, God didn't call you. You did.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Hello. That's what he said.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; I ran from it for years.
[54:56] But I believe that we all together
[54:59] have a vote of confidence that there is
[55:01] someone that's going to rightly divide
[55:04] the word of truth so that you can get
[55:05] what God's got for you.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Every one of you sitting here today,
[55:10] you're all prophetic people.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; It just takes a head like it takes a
[55:13] head of for Christ being the head.
[55:16] That's the problem with Eve. Eve didn't
[55:17] want headship. Right?
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Hey, Satan didn't want headship.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; He didn't want nobody above him.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; See, that's why when you if you want to
[55:30] be a pastor so bad, you want to be the
[55:32] full authority. And well, anyway, let's
[55:35] read the scripture and then we'll take
[55:36] communion. We'll clean oursel out on
[55:38] this one. Okay.
[55:40] This means this book can't be revealed.
[55:42] Listen, we're all common people.
[55:46] The shepherd doesn't go somewhere and
[55:48] live in an ivory castle and his sheep
[55:50] live out in the yard. He lives with his
[55:53] sheep.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; He may have to break a leg every once in
[55:58] a while, but he lives with his sheep. As
[56:01] one brother said, he smells like a
[56:03] sheep. He acts like a sheep because he's
[56:05] around the sheep. Okay? So, we're not
[56:08] separate. We're not a separate group of
[56:10] people. We're all one. We're going in
[56:12] one direction. If we're not going in one
[56:14] direction, then we're divided. But we're
[56:17] all going in one direction. I want us to
[56:19] get out of here.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; But it's going to be up to you to study
[56:23] to show yourself approved.
[56:26] So this book can't be revealed to anyone
[56:28] but a special class of people. It will
[56:30] take one with prophetic insight. What is
[56:33] prophetic insight? It is seeing
[56:35] something that someone else can't see.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Not making you bit. Listen, you're not
[56:41] better than the world.
[56:43] But to God, what you got inside of you
[56:45] is better than the world.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Don't think because you're a message
[56:50] believer that you walk on cloud nine and
[56:52] and you're some great something and and
[56:55] God's going to tell you first and your
[56:57] bills are not going to come due and
[56:59] you're not going to have a wreck and
[57:00] you're not going to have no problems
[57:02] with your boss.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; The devil has you. If you think if you
[57:09] think that either that or I'm living a
[57:12] wrong and I'm living in the wrong place
[57:15] because there's going to be trials but
[57:16] remember all those trials and
[57:17] tribulations we go through is for a
[57:19] purpose
[57:21] &gt;&gt; for a Christian there's something at the
[57:23] end of that test and it's called a
[57:26] testimony
[57:27] &gt;&gt; all right we have testimony after
[57:29] testimony after testimony why do we have
[57:31] testimonies because you went through a
[57:33] test if you didn't go through a test you
[57:35] wouldn't have a testimony but you do
[57:37] have have a testimony because you what?
[57:40] You can watch you can you can have
[57:44] supernatural instruction from God. Now,
[57:48] that has to come through a five-fold
[57:49] ministry. And and brother Manuel, I'm
[57:52] going to I'm going to whip him one day
[57:54] cuz we going to read the book of James
[57:56] again like he was reading today. And he
[57:57] did the same thing last Sunday. So,
[57:59] praise the Lord. At least we're on the
[58:01] same page. And I do appreciate that.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because remember when you come to
[58:05] when we come to the seals and we come to
[58:07] we can condense it all down to James
[58:11] when James says when lust is conceived
[58:14] it brings forth sin. When sin is
[58:16] finished it brings forth death. Four
[58:20] things.
[58:22] When it's conceived it brings forth sin.
[58:27] Lust it brings forth sin. When sin is
[58:30] finished it brings forth death. Listen.
[58:33] I'm going to tell you something from
[58:34] this pullpit. You are going to sin.
[58:37] So, it's not a problem with you sinning.
[58:40] It's a problem with you going on to the
[58:42] last part which will kill you.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; So, there's your four parts that we're
[58:47] going to look at in the seals because
[58:50] you got you got seal one, two, three,
[58:52] and four. Then we take a rapture. So,
[58:54] somewhere in that fourth seal, we have
[58:56] come to a place where we have no lust,
[59:00] we have no sin. And and what it is is a
[59:03] death to us.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; When we die, when we die, we're going to
[59:08] get out of here. The reason we're still
[59:10] here is because we are full of oursel.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Remember what Dwight Moody said? Dwight
[59:16] Moody said, "I God will fill anybody
[59:18] that's not full of their self."
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Think about that.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; So one brother says, "How long you been
[59:24] in this message?" He said, "Well,
[59:25] brother, I've been in the way about this
[59:27] way about 20 years." That man said,
[59:28] "That's your problem. You've been in the
[59:30] way for 20 years.
[59:32] So, let's just get out of the way. Let's
[59:34] make this year a new year to where we
[59:36] get out of the way
[59:37] &gt;&gt; and we take what's inside of us and like
[59:39] I always said, let it out. Let it live.
[59:43] And you say, "Well, I'm not used to it."
[59:45] Get used to it.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; If you're going to live eternally, you
[59:50] better get used to some of that now.
[59:53] You better get used to some of that
[59:55] where we walk in a way that God is
[59:58] pleased with.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Walk in a way that God's pleased. Not
[1:00:04] man,
[1:00:06] but God.
[1:00:08] Cuz if God's pleased with us, that means
[1:00:10] he's in us. That means he has control of
[1:00:14] us. And then whatever we're doing,
[1:00:18] he is approving of it. You know how you
[1:00:20] send somebody something, they send you a
[1:00:22] text message and and uh and you know,
[1:00:26] send Jeffrey a text message and Jeffrey
[1:00:27] just really don't want to answer you
[1:00:28] back, but he'll go,
[1:00:32] "Well, that's the way God is." You know,
[1:00:34] all he wants, he'll just give you that
[1:00:36] thumbs up, buddy. You did a good job on
[1:00:38] that one. But it will require
[1:00:40] supernatural instructions, not just a
[1:00:42] student comparing verse by verse, though
[1:00:44] that is good. So what we're doing is
[1:00:46] we're not we're we're trying to read
[1:00:48] between the lines. You got to read the
[1:00:50] lines, but we got to read between the
[1:00:53] lines because listen,
[1:00:56] Paul tells us that the letter kleth
[1:00:59] the copying of the letter, this this
[1:01:01] this ink, if you read that, like we're
[1:01:05] going to get into when we get to the
[1:01:07] fifth seal. When we get into that fifth
[1:01:09] seal, there's a group of people that
[1:01:11] that did not want God, did not believe
[1:01:14] in the Lord Jesus, and God gave them
[1:01:17] eternal life
[1:01:19] even though they didn't want it.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Now, see, that's grace.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Remember what grace is. Grace is not
[1:01:26] what you do. Grace is unmmerited favor
[1:01:29] for what you did.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Remember, grace is for your past, not
[1:01:34] your future. We don't believe in that
[1:01:36] Catholicism where you get you pay
[1:01:38] penance and then you know you're going
[1:01:39] to go, you know, do something a week
[1:01:41] from now or or whatever. No, it's for
[1:01:43] sins that are past. The Bible tells us
[1:01:45] that.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; I mean, how can you ask forgiveness for
[1:01:49] something you hadn't done yet? No, you
[1:01:51] ask forgiveness for the things you did
[1:01:53] in the past. And see the whole problem
[1:01:55] with us is on this side of the chasm we
[1:01:58] can remember them
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; but praise God on the other side of that
[1:02:02] chasm where God is he can't remember
[1:02:05] him.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; See that if if grace grace has amnesia.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Think about it. Grace has amnesia
[1:02:16] because God can forget. He can put grace
[1:02:18] on you and forget what you did in the
[1:02:20] past. Because if listen, if not, if he
[1:02:22] sees your sin, he's got to condemn you
[1:02:24] for it.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; So, we can't be the spotless, sinless
[1:02:28] bride of Jesus Christ unless we see that
[1:02:30] God gives us grace every day of the
[1:02:33] week, every hour of the day, everything
[1:02:35] we do. Brother Bram, I read you that
[1:02:37] quote not too long ago. Brother Bram
[1:02:38] said, "My whole makeup is grace." Now,
[1:02:40] you would think when he was preaching
[1:02:42] the sermon, marriage and divorce, or he
[1:02:44] was preaching another sermon where he
[1:02:46] just really, you know, bit down on the
[1:02:48] people, you think, man, that ain't a lot
[1:02:49] of grace. No, it was grace to the people
[1:02:51] that accepted it.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Grace has to be accepted. It's like that
[1:02:56] pardon. The pardon was written by
[1:02:58] Abraham Lincoln. The pardon was given to
[1:03:00] the jud to the to the jailer. The pardon
[1:03:02] was given to the man and he declined it.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; But that pardon is still there,
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; signed by Abraham Lincoln,
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; but he didn't accept it and they killed
[1:03:15] him the next day. I know you've all
[1:03:17] heard the story if you've been around
[1:03:18] the message long enough, but that's a
[1:03:20] very good analogy of grace
[1:03:22] because remember the guy did the guy did
[1:03:25] kill the the person remember the his
[1:03:28] buddy go and said I know he killed him
[1:03:29] in a fit of rage you know give him the
[1:03:31] case and Abraham like Abraham Lincoln
[1:03:33] signed pardon Abraham Lincoln took it to
[1:03:36] the guy the guy said I don't think
[1:03:38] that's Abraham Lincoln I don't have to
[1:03:39] live that word
[1:03:43] I don't have to go to church I don't
[1:03:46] have to study.
[1:03:48] Well, well, you know what your messenger
[1:03:49] is going to tell you? You're going to
[1:03:51] die
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; because you did this. You did the sin.
[1:03:55] But here's your pardon to get out of
[1:03:56] that, not get out of that or get away.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; It's to cover you because we're human
[1:04:02] beings
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; and we make mistakes. Amen.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; So if we read between the lines, we will
[1:04:09] see the grace because if you read the
[1:04:12] scripture
[1:04:14] as brother Brandham said, you read
[1:04:16] scripture
[1:04:18] that says, and we're going to get into
[1:04:19] marriage and divorce later on, but
[1:04:20] because brother Brandham said because of
[1:04:22] the opening of seals that he could
[1:04:23] preach this, okay?
[1:04:25] Because the Bible says if you marry
[1:04:27] somebody else and you already married to
[1:04:29] somebody and you got a living wife or
[1:04:31] husband,
[1:04:33] I'm sorry. You have no chance.
[1:04:38] That's what the Bible says.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; You have no chance. But praise God.
[1:04:44] You're not going to get by with it. But
[1:04:46] God knew you would come to that place
[1:04:50] and you would need grace.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; And that's why he give it. Listen, grace
[1:04:54] is not for perfect people.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Grace is for people that have sins, that
[1:04:59] has passed. And listen,
[1:05:02] if you glory in your past, you have a
[1:05:04] problem.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; I don't glory in my past 10 minutes ago.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Other than I can bring a message to you
[1:05:12] to see that you can get it, but still
[1:05:14] things go through my head like they're
[1:05:16] falling asleep. There's already in
[1:05:18] somewhere opening Christmas presents,
[1:05:20] you know, it's like
[1:05:23] But a mystery requires the teaching of
[1:05:25] the spirit.
[1:05:27] Here is a problem. All right. Here is
[1:05:31] the problem. Some people don't like
[1:05:33] mysteries.
[1:05:36] Cuz what is a mystery?
[1:05:38] It's something that you don't know. It's
[1:05:40] already been done. Like the mystery of
[1:05:42] like we were talking about, you know,
[1:05:43] going to um playing that clue. The
[1:05:47] murder's already done. You just got to
[1:05:50] find the culprit.
[1:05:52] Right? And finding the culprit, you get
[1:05:54] what? Clues. But it's a mystery. And
[1:05:58] some people don't like mysteries. I like
[1:06:00] mysteries because that's what God told
[1:06:01] us. If we are believers of this message,
[1:06:04] we love mystery. Because brother Brown
[1:06:08] said, "We, the bride, love revelation."
[1:06:12] So what is revelation? It's a mystery
[1:06:16] that's got something behind it, but the
[1:06:18] veil's been lifted and it's not a
[1:06:20] mystery anymore.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said the mystery now has
[1:06:22] become history.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; I mean, do we need to know again how to
[1:06:30] baptize?
[1:06:32] We're pretty sure about what we're
[1:06:34] talking about when we talk about water
[1:06:35] baptism.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; We're not pretty sure. We're real sure.
[1:06:39] There is no other way to baptize except
[1:06:41] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:06:43] Amen.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; So that's an assurity. Now why can't we
[1:06:46] take the things that are and that one
[1:06:48] time was a mystery to you folks? Come
[1:06:50] on.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; How many of y'all were baptized in the
[1:06:53] name of father, son, holy ghost? Don't
[1:06:55] be ashamed.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Lord. Well, that's okay. Well, mom was
[1:06:59] too. Well, you out. Mom.
[1:07:03] No, that was what we believed at the
[1:07:05] time.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; And God winked at that. But when he gave
[1:07:09] you, see this is the difference in in
[1:07:11] being bride and not bride. When he put
[1:07:13] the truth in front of you, you accepted
[1:07:15] it.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Boyd,
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; you put that truth in front of you.
[1:07:18] First thing he said was, "That ain't the
[1:07:20] way to baptize.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; That ain't the way to do it."
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; So what we've done though, we've took
[1:07:26] that mystery and it's become history.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; So what we're doing with this, Come on,
[1:07:31] somebody. What we're doing with this
[1:07:32] mystery, WE'RE TRYING TO GIVE IT TO
[1:07:34] SOMEBODY ELSE. WE'RE TRYING TO GET THEM
[1:07:36] TO SEE, NOT SEE YOU.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Come on. Don't somebody go up say, "Hey,
[1:07:40] look at me. I dress right. You know your
[1:07:43] sisters, I dress right. I do this right.
[1:07:45] I'M THIS RIGHT." NO. TELL THEM ABOUT THE
[1:07:47] SAVING GRACE OF JESUS CHRIST FIRST.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; How he turned you around. If you can't
[1:07:52] tell them how you he turned you around,
[1:07:54] YOU DON'T HAVE A TESTIMONY.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; You need the new birth.
[1:08:00] BUT IF YOU GOT THE NEW BIRTH, LISTEN,
[1:08:01] all you sisters that have children, you
[1:08:03] were there when that baby was born.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; You knew what was going on. You knew
[1:08:07] what happened and you were there. Well,
[1:08:09] you know what? You were there when you
[1:08:11] got birthed.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; You should know what's going on.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; But God loves
[1:08:20] somebody that'll dig just a little bit
[1:08:21] deeper.
[1:08:23] that'll dig just a little that that'll
[1:08:25] like we was talking last week, that'll
[1:08:27] take the paper wrapping off of that and
[1:08:28] want to see what's in that box. That's
[1:08:31] what God wants from now on. From here
[1:08:33] till the day we take a rapture, God
[1:08:35] wants us to dig deeper than we've ever
[1:08:36] dug before.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; And that's not just me. That's all of
[1:08:40] us.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Not dig a hole. Come on. We don't want
[1:08:44] to be digging no holes, but we want to
[1:08:47] dig into the word of God. And if you
[1:08:48] come up to a wall, which you will, cuz
[1:08:50] the devil will be there. The devil's
[1:08:52] listening to this sermon,
[1:08:55] okay?
[1:08:56] He know what he knows what I'm saying
[1:08:58] and he's going to get to you and say,
[1:08:59] "Oh, you really don't need that. You
[1:09:01] don't need this. You shouldn't do this.
[1:09:02] You're not here. You're not here." Well,
[1:09:04] he's a he's a liar, so he's just doing
[1:09:06] his job. That's why I tell people when
[1:09:08] I'm delivering mail, their dog comes out
[1:09:10] and barks, bark, bark, bark, bark, and
[1:09:11] they're trying to get him shut up, shut
[1:09:12] up, shut. I said, "He's just doing what
[1:09:14] a dog's doing.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; He's barking. That's what a dog's
[1:09:17] supposed to do."
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; So, you know what? There's a Christian.
[1:09:25] He's supposed to be doing what a
[1:09:26] Christian does.
[1:09:30] So, how we need to hear from God and lay
[1:09:32] oursel open and become yielded to the
[1:09:33] spirit to hear and to know. Don't be
[1:09:36] afraid of revelation.
[1:09:39] You can't be afraid of revelation if
[1:09:41] you're not born. If you're born again,
[1:09:43] you cannot
[1:09:46] because it'll sustain you. Because you
[1:09:47] know what's going to happen? Satan hates
[1:09:49] it.
[1:09:51] Satan hates it. So, he's not going to be
[1:09:53] nowhere around unless he's going to give
[1:09:54] you, you know, five people are going to
[1:09:56] call you and three neighbors are going
[1:09:58] to show up and somebody you've never
[1:09:59] seen before is going to going to show up
[1:10:01] on your porch and try to take up your
[1:10:03] time.
[1:10:05] Well, well, pray for me. Cuz it always
[1:10:07] happens when you're trying to study or
[1:10:09] trying to do something. Somebody will
[1:10:10] show up and and you know what? It's just
[1:10:13] the devil. Now, I ain't talking about
[1:10:14] the people that just showed up, but I'm
[1:10:16] talking about the the motivation behind
[1:10:18] it is the devil don't want us to get
[1:10:20] anything.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? The devil does not
[1:10:23] want us to be prophetic people.
[1:10:27] He knows. Now, what did brother say?
[1:10:30] Satan knows that if the true church
[1:10:34] gets a revelation of who she is, in
[1:10:36] other words, paraphrasing, she'll be an
[1:10:38] invincible army. Well, he knows that. So
[1:10:41] what's his what's his job? To per forbid
[1:10:44] us to do that
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; by giving us everything in the world.
[1:10:49] Everybody with me.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; And we have to live life. But listen,
[1:10:54] give God this year, give him just 10
[1:10:56] more minutes in one day.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; 10 more minutes. Just give him 10
[1:11:01] minutes. And if you have to set your
[1:11:03] watch,
[1:11:05] set your phone and give him say, "Lord,
[1:11:08] I'm giving you 10 more today. I've given
[1:11:10] you my prayers this morning. I've given
[1:11:12] you my Bible reading. I maybe listened
[1:11:14] to a part of a tape. I maybe did this. I
[1:11:17] may have talked to a brother. But Lord,
[1:11:19] at the end, I want to give you 10 more
[1:11:20] minutes.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Now, do you think he's going to go, "No,
[1:11:23] I don't want that." No. He's going to be
[1:11:25] glad that you're doing making an effort.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; This whole thing is an effort
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; cuz your natural body does not even want
[1:11:34] to be here today.
[1:11:40] people are at home sitting there with
[1:11:41] their jammies on and and well anyway
[1:11:46] listening to tapes or whatever they do
[1:11:48] on Sunday morning when they don't go to
[1:11:49] church. They're in their jammies
[1:11:50] watching the watching a sermon and and I
[1:11:53] know some people can't come to church
[1:11:55] and I appreciate the internet. Don't you
[1:11:57] forget don't think I am no for people
[1:12:00] that can't get out. I appreciate the
[1:12:03] people that can stream and and our
[1:12:04] brothers and and all that can do the
[1:12:06] work back there that can get that
[1:12:08] streaming out for them. Don't you think
[1:12:10] that? But if you're an able-bodied
[1:12:11] person and you live close to here, and
[1:12:13] I'm talking about close to here is
[1:12:15] within four hours because that's our
[1:12:17] standard.
[1:12:19] And Sister Trudy McMillan set that
[1:12:21] standard. Listen, I want y'all to call
[1:12:23] her before Christmas
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; cuz we're going to try to go down there.
[1:12:26] But I want if if if no effort if just
[1:12:28] call her. The number was on the screen.
[1:12:31] Brother Joe's got the number. The
[1:12:32] number's somewhere. Just call her and
[1:12:33] tell her we miss her. And she'll she'll
[1:12:36] see it today because she always watches
[1:12:38] in. But see, she set the standard years
[1:12:40] ago. For those of you that are new, we
[1:12:43] had a sister come from Charlotte, North
[1:12:44] Carolina. She drove four hours one way
[1:12:48] to come to church here. She passed 50
[1:12:52] message churches to get here. But she
[1:12:54] said this is where God told her to be.
[1:12:56] This is where she would get fed would be
[1:12:58] right here. 4 hours. Yes.
[1:13:02] So when you were still asleep, she was
[1:13:04] on the highway driving
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; and when we get home in the afternoon
[1:13:09] and done eat our supper and got ready
[1:13:12] for bed, she's just now getting home.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; And her husband wasn't a believer. He
[1:13:16] let her come by herself. And in all
[1:13:18] those years, she broke down one time.
[1:13:22] One time in almost 20 years that she
[1:13:24] drove down here. Listen, y'all know, you
[1:13:28] older people know she's here every
[1:13:29] Sunday.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; She's here every Sunday. She drove
[1:13:33] through snow. She drove through wrecks.
[1:13:36] So there, you can blame her if you don't
[1:13:38] blame her, but there's your four hour
[1:13:39] there's your four four-hour circle.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; You know what? God blessed her. She's 80
[1:13:47] something years old and 87 88 years old
[1:13:51] and she still calls and says she loves
[1:13:53] us all, loves the Lord.
[1:13:56] Wow.
[1:13:58] You give the effort. That's my whole
[1:14:00] point. You give an effort to God. He's
[1:14:02] got to give you a positive effort back
[1:14:06] cuz God can never give you negative.
[1:14:09] It's always positive. All right? So, we
[1:14:13] are people with prophetic insight. We
[1:14:15] are prophetic people with insight. So we
[1:14:18] see that when someone when someone like
[1:14:21] if you listen to somebody online and I
[1:14:22] do listen to um several online and I do
[1:14:26] I listen to some denominational people
[1:14:27] if I see a good little title that kind
[1:14:29] of you know ps your interest you know
[1:14:32] but but with prophetic insight you're
[1:14:34] sitting there going how can you preach
[1:14:36] that?
[1:14:38] Why? Because
[1:14:41] I'm sorry
[1:14:43] they're under the anointing of a false
[1:14:45] Christ.
[1:14:46] I'll show it to you right here in a
[1:14:48] minute. They're under the anointing of
[1:14:50] Satan. Brother Brown said Satan will be
[1:14:54] their God.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; And see, that's what the seals is
[1:14:57] proving to us that Satan is religious
[1:15:01] and Satan is in denomination
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; and Satan is here today trying to
[1:15:07] disrupt us and create us and make us
[1:15:10] into a denomination.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; He loves denomination. Why? Because it's
[1:15:16] what brother Ram say he said I know now
[1:15:18] why I hated that thing
[1:15:22] because it's of the devil. It was one of
[1:15:23] those horse riders.
[1:15:27] Then remember being a prophetic people.
[1:15:30] So in other words for us to take the
[1:15:32] prophecy we've got to be able to explain
[1:15:35] the prophecy.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? We got to be able to
[1:15:39] explain the prophecy. It's not just And
[1:15:42] there's private things that God shows
[1:15:43] you. There's private things God showed
[1:15:45] brother Brandham, but the one the things
[1:15:47] he showed brother Brandham was what? For
[1:15:49] him.
[1:15:51] But thank God, everything else that was
[1:15:52] for us, he told us
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; cuz why? It was the voice of God to us
[1:15:57] in the end time. And God's not going to
[1:15:59] withhold it from us
[1:16:02] as the bride of Jesus Christ. He cannot
[1:16:04] withhold it. He won't withhold. Why
[1:16:06] would you? And Jesus even says in the
[1:16:08] scripture, they say, "Why would you
[1:16:10] being a father give your your son ask
[1:16:12] for bread and you give him a scorpion or
[1:16:14] you ask for this and you give him a
[1:16:16] rock?" That's not a heavenly father that
[1:16:18] we have.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Our heavenly father wants to bless us
[1:16:21] more than we want to be blessed.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; All right. So, let's go. Let's skip on
[1:16:27] over and let's go to Now, we know what a
[1:16:29] mystery is. when Jesus was talking to
[1:16:30] the group of people there in Matthew 24
[1:16:32] and I brought today a Bible with 26
[1:16:36] translations and that dad bought
[1:16:37] somebody bought it for him a long time
[1:16:38] ago and uh actually some of these
[1:16:40] markers are his and uh but I want to
[1:16:43] read you some different angles of the
[1:16:45] same and it makes sometimes it makes it
[1:16:47] a little more plain because we are
[1:16:50] English
[1:16:51] trying to understand we're a western
[1:16:53] people trying to understand an eastern
[1:16:55] language that's what brother Bram told
[1:16:56] us but a mystery is a hidden or secret
[1:16:58] thing look not obvious to the
[1:17:01] understanding.
[1:17:03] A hidden purpose or counsel, secret will
[1:17:05] of men of God. The secret council which
[1:17:08] govern God in dealing with the righteous
[1:17:11] which are hidden from ungodly and wicked
[1:17:14] men but plain to the godly.
[1:17:17] What? When we read
[1:17:20] Matthew 28:19 and we read Acts 2:38, we
[1:17:24] immediately know that agrees with our
[1:17:26] soul that it's the same thing, saying
[1:17:28] the same identical thing. Now, the
[1:17:30] letter killth though. So, what are we
[1:17:33] reading? We're reading the love letter
[1:17:35] in between the lines that God's telling
[1:17:38] us to baptize in the name of the Father
[1:17:39] and of the Son and the Holy Ghost.
[1:17:40] Absolutely. But those are not names. You
[1:17:43] got to come over here to the day of
[1:17:44] Pentecost and see that the name Jesus
[1:17:46] Christ is the name of our Lord.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; And like I said before, a lot of people
[1:17:51] want him to be Jesus. A lot of people
[1:17:52] want him to be this, but they do not
[1:17:54] want him to be their Lord. Right.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Now, remember, Brother Brian was
[1:18:02] explaining to us
[1:18:04] and my first sermon I preached years and
[1:18:07] years ago,
[1:18:09] it was uh I think we still got the it
[1:18:11] was a VHS. So, for those of you that
[1:18:14] don't know what a VHS No, don't don't
[1:18:16] start. You don't even know what a VHS
[1:18:18] is, do you? Really? You must have saw it
[1:18:21] in a pawn shop somewhere.
[1:18:24] Did you see it in an antique store?
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; You watch it? Oh, okay. All right.
[1:18:31] Well, Brother Dick had this great big
[1:18:32] camera and it was, you know, this big
[1:18:36] and he had on Yeah. had on his shoulder
[1:18:38] and he recorded it. So, but I told I
[1:18:40] what I did was I took a parallel of
[1:18:42] three people.
[1:18:44] All right.
[1:18:45] And I didn't tell y'all who it was or y
[1:18:48] most y'all weren't here, but I took and
[1:18:51] showed a life of three people and showed
[1:18:54] a parallel of those three people.
[1:18:57] All right?
[1:18:59] Actually, it was four people.
[1:19:01] It was Moses,
[1:19:04] it was Jesus,
[1:19:06] it was Paul, and it was brother Brandon
[1:19:09] was who I was talking about. But
[1:19:11] everybody thought I was talking about
[1:19:13] the Lord
[1:19:15] because what was Moses given a
[1:19:16] commission in a burning bush? Fire.
[1:19:19] Pillar of fire. Right? Just paraphrase
[1:19:21] all this. Then Moses
[1:19:24] brought the law.
[1:19:26] All right? Then you got Jesus being born
[1:19:28] the day was when he was born, there was
[1:19:30] a light in heaven, right?
[1:19:32] Paul got struck down on the day of on
[1:19:35] the road to Damascus by what?
[1:19:38] A light, right? And then brother Brandon
[1:19:41] when he was born there was a light that
[1:19:43] come into the room. So it parallels all
[1:19:45] to the different ones. But to read
[1:19:47] between the lines to be no I'm sorry to
[1:19:50] narrow it down everybody thought I was
[1:19:51] talking about Jesus. But when at the
[1:19:53] very end then I took it back and pulled
[1:19:54] it back apart and it was talking about
[1:19:56] Moses, the Lord, Paul and brother
[1:19:58] Brandham. All of them basically live the
[1:20:01] same way. Why? Because it was the same
[1:20:03] God and a prophet. the pro or a prophet,
[1:20:07] the prophet, a prophet, and a prophet.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; But now remember, you and I are
[1:20:11] prophetic people. We're supposed to be
[1:20:14] the same way. Now listen, you and I are
[1:20:15] not supposed to be I know Brother Brown
[1:20:17] tells us, he says, you know, every
[1:20:20] minister needs to be go on the back side
[1:20:22] of the desert and have a Moses a burning
[1:20:24] bush experience. Well, now literally
[1:20:26] that's never happened to me. And I don't
[1:20:28] know one preacher that's ever told me
[1:20:30] that that literally happened. They went
[1:20:33] out to the desert and uh and saw a
[1:20:35] burning bush or or saw a light. But what
[1:20:39] was brother telling? We got to meet God
[1:20:40] like they met God.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; You got to meet God. And see Moses's
[1:20:44] revelation was that bush was not
[1:20:47] burning. So it must be God. And it spoke
[1:20:49] to me.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; It spoke to Moses.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; All right. Now that same person that
[1:20:54] spoke to Moses came as a baby.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Ain't two gods.
[1:21:00] that one that Paul struck Paul down.
[1:21:02] What'd he say? He said, "I'm Jesus who
[1:21:04] you persecute." And it had to be the
[1:21:07] same God that came to brother Brandon
[1:21:08] when he was a child and said, "Don't
[1:21:10] smoke or drink or do these things. Don't
[1:21:12] defile your body because there's a work
[1:21:14] for you later on." Moses got the same
[1:21:16] commission. Jesus got the same
[1:21:18] commission. Paul's the only one that
[1:21:20] really was later in life that got this
[1:21:22] commission because God wanted him to
[1:21:25] walk through fire for a little while.
[1:21:27] He wanted Paul to see he was persecuting
[1:21:31] the Christians. He thought he was doing
[1:21:33] the work of the Lord.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Paul was zealous about putting these
[1:21:38] Christians in in jail and causing them
[1:21:41] to blaspheme.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Wow. We think we got problems.
[1:21:46] And then for him to be chosen by God to
[1:21:48] bring the message to the Gentiles, be
[1:21:50] the first church age messenger and be a
[1:21:53] prophet. WOW.
[1:21:56] WOW. SO PAUL HAD PAUL'S The things I do,
[1:21:59] I would not. The things I would not, I
[1:22:00] do. I war in my members. What he
[1:22:03] remembers? Could you imagine knowing
[1:22:05] this guy named Paul or Saul?
[1:22:09] And then Ananas was told by the Lord
[1:22:11] that you got to pray for that guy.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; He's going to come to your house. And
[1:22:16] they're hiding from they're hiding from
[1:22:19] Saul
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; cuz Saul would take him into prison.
[1:22:22] Right?
[1:22:23] So now the Lord is telling Ananas,
[1:22:27] Saul's coming to your house and you got
[1:22:30] to pray for him. Boy, talk about faith.
[1:22:34] Cuz all the other ones, I'm sure in the
[1:22:36] back part of his mind, he's like, "Man,
[1:22:38] I got three or four friends in prison
[1:22:40] just because of that man. Or I've had
[1:22:42] three or four people killed because of
[1:22:44] that man, and I got to bring him into my
[1:22:46] house and pray for him
[1:22:49] to receive the Holy Ghost." That's how
[1:22:51] God works. Amen.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; But you see all the the parallels to
[1:22:55] each to the life. But you got to read
[1:22:57] between the lines to find them though.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; And that's what we're doing now because
[1:23:01] watch what happened with Jesus in
[1:23:04] Matthew 24
[1:23:06] verse one. And Jesus went out. Now this
[1:23:08] is right before this is right before he
[1:23:11] was crucified.
[1:23:13] Like a week or so before. Brother Brown
[1:23:15] gives us the almost the exact date that
[1:23:17] they ask him a certain question. And
[1:23:19] they asked him one in the morning and
[1:23:21] two in the afternoon. And how did he
[1:23:22] know that? Why? He was a prophet. He
[1:23:23] knew that. All right.
[1:23:27] So Jesus said unto them or the
[1:23:28] disciples, they came to Now now watch.
[1:23:33] They came without understanding.
[1:23:36] Just like you and I come to the Lord
[1:23:38] without understanding.
[1:23:40] How many times have we read scripture
[1:23:42] and not understood it?
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; We all have. But now God didn't write
[1:23:47] that for us not to understand.
[1:23:51] He wrote every scripture for us to
[1:23:52] understand. Or he's a god that gives
[1:23:55] rocks instead of bread
[1:23:58] or scorpions instead of meat.
[1:24:02] Everything's given for profit of his
[1:24:05] bride to profit. Pi t.
[1:24:10] So Jesus went out and departed from the
[1:24:12] temple. His disciples came to him for to
[1:24:14] show him the buildings of the temple.
[1:24:16] And Jesus said unto them, "See you not
[1:24:18] all these things? Verily I say unto you,
[1:24:21] there shall not be left here one stone
[1:24:23] upon another that shall not be thrown
[1:24:25] down."
[1:24:27] And as he said upon the mount of olives,
[1:24:29] the disciples came unto him private. Now
[1:24:30] remember the disciples, some of them
[1:24:32] were older. Peter was older, different
[1:24:34] ones. John was a baby, but there were
[1:24:36] some that were older that can remember
[1:24:38] they went to that temple all the time.
[1:24:40] That temple was revered that you didn't
[1:24:42] touch that temple except you were a
[1:24:44] Levite or or a priest. All right,
[1:24:46] everybody with me now. He This man is
[1:24:49] talking about this thing is going to be
[1:24:51] tore to pieces.
[1:24:54] There won't be one stone left on
[1:24:56] another. And y'all saw you saw pictures
[1:24:58] of the whailing wall.
[1:25:01] Those how big those weren't pebbles.
[1:25:03] Those were stones. And they set all them
[1:25:06] together. And that was the bottom of
[1:25:10] where the temple was, but the temple sat
[1:25:12] on top of it. So Jesus said, "Every one
[1:25:15] of these are going to be rolled away."
[1:25:18] He told them, he said, 'Look,
[1:25:21] there shall not be left one stone upon
[1:25:23] another that shall not be thrown down.
[1:25:28] What am I saying?
[1:25:30] You're a temple of God. You are the
[1:25:33] temple of the Holy Ghost, but you're a
[1:25:35] temple of God, even though you don't
[1:25:36] have the Holy Ghost.
[1:25:38] All right?
[1:25:40] Satan is the one that motivates you, but
[1:25:43] your body was given to you by God.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Come on. Satan can't create. He can
[1:25:49] pervert. And he's perverted all the ones
[1:25:51] that have the carnal mind. But we're
[1:25:54] temple. Paul tells us whose temples we
[1:25:57] are. So Jesus is fixing to tell them,
[1:26:00] say, look, this temple is going to be
[1:26:03] torn down.
[1:26:05] So when the seals come forth, guess what
[1:26:09] happened?
[1:26:11] Your temple will be torn down.
[1:26:16] Your temple will be not one stone left
[1:26:19] on another
[1:26:21] cuz God is remember in the scripture,
[1:26:23] God is he told Zerubable he's going to
[1:26:26] take it down to the foundation.
[1:26:29] Then he's going to rebuild that temple.
[1:26:31] Jesus was telling them this temple is
[1:26:34] temporary.
[1:26:36] But the temple I want now is you.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; I want you to be the temple. And I'm
[1:26:42] going to rebuild. I'm going to rebuild
[1:26:45] and put stone upon stone, revelation
[1:26:47] upon revelation. And I am going to
[1:26:50] inhabit your temple.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; If you will let me.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; And this is how we're going to do it. I
[1:26:58] want you to be aware of what's coming.
[1:27:02] Everybody with me? I want you to be
[1:27:04] aware of what's coming because what
[1:27:06] happened is what has happened all
[1:27:08] through the ages. Man has said it's
[1:27:10] this. Man has said uh hell is eternal.
[1:27:13] We've talked about that with that Kirk
[1:27:14] Cameron guy, you know. I mean, he's
[1:27:16] still they're still crucifying that guy
[1:27:18] cuz he said hell's not eternal.
[1:27:21] Remember brother Dell always told you
[1:27:22] the Baptist buddy you they'll fight you
[1:27:24] for everything in the world about said
[1:27:26] they'll fry you, you know, they'll
[1:27:28] dangle you over hell like a weenie. Fry
[1:27:30] you up. just tell you it's eternal and
[1:27:32] you're going to eternally be
[1:27:36] that's what they're built on.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; But thank God this guy
[1:27:44] at least sees that hell's not eternal.
[1:27:47] Listen, there's an eternal judgment.
[1:27:48] Once you're separated from God, there's
[1:27:50] no way to get back.
[1:27:52] It is an eternal separation. Because
[1:27:53] remember, if you're if you're separated
[1:27:55] from God and you're not coming back and
[1:27:57] he sees you're not coming back, you're
[1:27:59] going in that direction.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; And then one day you're just going to
[1:28:03] completely go away.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; You never were here to begin with.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; But thank God when God brings you the
[1:28:11] new birth, that's the real you. That's
[1:28:14] the part of him that Genesis 1:26 man
[1:28:16] that comes to you at the new birth and
[1:28:17] it is eternal. And that means that you
[1:28:19] are going to have an eternal way about
[1:28:23] you. And excuse me, if your if your body
[1:28:26] dies, you're still eternal.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Jesus came here to annihilate death.
[1:28:32] Now, did he annihilate death?
[1:28:36] He was lying if he didn't.
[1:28:39] But he wasn't talking about the death
[1:28:40] they were talking about.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; He said, "I come here to give you
[1:28:44] eternal life. YOU MIGHT DIE, BUT THAT
[1:28:47] ETERNAL life's not going to ever die.
[1:28:49] I'm bringing you something that can't
[1:28:51] die.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; I am not going to not tell you that your
[1:28:56] body will never die. I'm telling you
[1:28:58] that your soul will never die.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; But they misunderstood him.
[1:29:03] Oh, you're not going to die. I come here
[1:29:05] to bring you life and and life
[1:29:07] everlasting.
[1:29:08] Well, then people just kept right on
[1:29:10] dying naturally, but spiritually, you
[1:29:13] can't die.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's no way you can die. So, as
[1:29:17] he sat upon the mountain, wouldn't it be
[1:29:18] nice to be there that day? But you know
[1:29:20] what? I would have never wanted to be
[1:29:21] there on that day.
[1:29:25] Yeah, sometimes I say stuff
[1:29:29] cuz they didn't know more what he was
[1:29:31] talking about than anything. But we're
[1:29:33] standing here today knowing exactly what
[1:29:35] he's talking about.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Had you rather pick that day or this
[1:29:38] day? Cuz remember, the seals were not
[1:29:40] revealed to anybody, even Paul. right
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; until today.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; So, where would you rather be? Brother
[1:29:49] Ram says, he said, "Oh, you got all
[1:29:51] these, how'd you like to be with Paul?
[1:29:52] How'd you like to be with the
[1:29:53] disciples?" Had been, he said, "I'd pick
[1:29:55] this day."
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Which day would you pick, William
[1:29:58] Brandham? He said, "This day right here,
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; the day of the revelation of all that
[1:30:02] that God told." LISTEN, THAT MAN spent
[1:30:06] 30ome years of his life and not one
[1:30:09] person understood him. His mother didn't
[1:30:12] even understand him.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Tell me one that did until the day of
[1:30:17] Pentecost.
[1:30:19] No one did.
[1:30:21] And listen, you will not understand him
[1:30:23] either.
[1:30:25] Until you get the new birth, until you
[1:30:27] get that same person inside of you,
[1:30:29] you're not going to understand either.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; That's why it's important that we know
[1:30:33] that we got the new birth. We know that
[1:30:35] we've we've been we've passed from death
[1:30:38] unto life.
[1:30:39] And it's not going to hurt us if we
[1:30:41] physically have to pass away.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Can't kill me no more than anything. You
[1:30:46] can't kill me no more than you can kill
[1:30:48] God.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; If you're born again today, you can say
[1:30:51] the same thing cuz God can't kill God.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; You ought to you ought to glory in that.
[1:30:59] And then from that time say, "Look, God,
[1:31:01] now you told me that you would show me
[1:31:03] the deep secrets that you've hid from
[1:31:06] man since the foundation of the world."
[1:31:08] didn't know what the Bible says.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; And people are reading this same Bible.
[1:31:11] They're preaching 13,000 different
[1:31:12] denominations out of this one Bible
[1:31:14] today.
[1:31:17] You ought to thank God
[1:31:19] that he's giving you an opportunity even
[1:31:21] to listen to the message of the hour.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; But just to listen to it, folks, is
[1:31:26] death.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; It's worse death
[1:31:31] because it's so plain today
[1:31:34] till you have no excuse. We have no
[1:31:36] excuse.
[1:31:39] So the disciples asked him said, 'Look,
[1:31:41] you're talking about leaving. Tell me
[1:31:43] when you're coming back. When shall
[1:31:45] these things be and what shall be the
[1:31:47] sign of thy coming and of the end of the
[1:31:50] world?
[1:31:53] Now we know that the Lord came as a
[1:31:56] natural baby as a child. Now he's going
[1:32:00] he came back on the day of Pentecost
[1:32:01] into a group of people. All right? And
[1:32:05] then now he's come back in the end time
[1:32:06] as the son of man to open the seals. All
[1:32:10] right, is everybody with me?
[1:32:12] But there's going to be a time, a
[1:32:14] physical time when he's going to come
[1:32:16] back to this earth and there'll be
[1:32:18] judgment and whatever more. We don't
[1:32:19] want to be there. We want to be that
[1:32:21] secret going away where they don't know
[1:32:23] who he is. They that we're God's going
[1:32:26] to just pull us out in the and we're
[1:32:28] gone.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; But you're not it's not going to happen
[1:32:30] just because you're sitting here today.
[1:32:33] It's going to happen because you have
[1:32:35] been changed into what has been preached
[1:32:38] to you for all the years of your life.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; And listen, as brother Luis was saying
[1:32:45] the other day, we 11th hour worker. If
[1:32:47] you just come in a message a year ago,
[1:32:49] two years ago, 5 years ago, or 30
[1:32:51] minutes ago, you're an 11th hour worker.
[1:32:54] You get the same if you'll go to the if
[1:32:57] you'll go to the boss
[1:32:59] and SAY, "BOSS, YOU HIRED ME
[1:33:03] FOR THAT ONE HOUR OF WORK.
[1:33:07] I'm going to get the same as a person
[1:33:08] did that's been working 11 hours." Now,
[1:33:11] listen, that's hard to do if you work a
[1:33:13] natural job.
[1:33:15] All right?
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; But not with not with God.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Because remember, God's not a respector
[1:33:21] of persons. He'll give you just as much
[1:33:23] chance as 11th hour worker as he did a
[1:33:25] worker that's been in the message for
[1:33:26] all these years.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you have a chance to get out
[1:33:31] of here just like somebody's been here.
[1:33:33] Seniority means zero to God.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:33:39] It's good to say you got seniority, but
[1:33:42] to God, he said that didn't matter. I
[1:33:44] got 11 hour worker that's going to get
[1:33:46] just as much as the person that was, you
[1:33:47] know, with me for 11 hours.
[1:33:50] So when we look at the seals, Jesus was
[1:33:53] talking to them in parables. Remember he
[1:33:55] always talks in parables. And Jesus
[1:33:57] answered and said unto them, "Take heed
[1:33:59] that no man deceive you." Okay? All
[1:34:01] right? No man deceive you. For many
[1:34:03] shall come in my name, saying, "I am
[1:34:05] Christ." Now, he didn't say, "Come in
[1:34:08] and say, I am the Lord Jesus Christ."
[1:34:12] Because remember Christ, what does
[1:34:14] Christ mean? Christ means the anointed
[1:34:16] one.
[1:34:17] Because there's going to be false
[1:34:19] Christ.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; He didn't say false Jesuses or false
[1:34:23] lords. There's going to be false Christ.
[1:34:25] And Christ is an anointed one. Remember
[1:34:27] anointed ones end time. Brother said you
[1:34:28] can be anointed with the baptism of the
[1:34:31] Holy Ghost every day of your life on
[1:34:32] your spirit realm and die and go to
[1:34:34] hell. Why? Because you've never had a
[1:34:36] relationship. Remember the Bible tells
[1:34:37] us they come up to Jesus and they say,
[1:34:39] "Have I not done this? Have I not done
[1:34:41] cast out devils?" I mean, everybody
[1:34:42] wants emotion. Everybody wants uh a
[1:34:44] healing campaign. Everybody want No,
[1:34:49] no. Cuz I'm telling you with that
[1:34:51] parallel, Moses fed the people.
[1:34:56] Sorry. God fed the people. God watered
[1:34:58] the people.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when all that come to an end,
[1:35:05] they hated Moses
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; because he give them the law.
[1:35:10] Amen. Jesus comes on the scene. He has a
[1:35:13] healing campaign of a few years. He
[1:35:16] feeds them. He heals them. Then they
[1:35:18] hated him. Paul comes on the scene.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Same thing. Brother Brandham comes on
[1:35:26] the scene. Thousands upon thousands. You
[1:35:29] ought to see some of them old pictures.
[1:35:30] Tens of thousands of people.
[1:35:34] When he preached the rapture message in
[1:35:36] 1964, there was 30 people in a trailer
[1:35:39] out in Arizona. Why? He started saying,
[1:35:43] "I am a father of one." He started
[1:35:46] bringing the real message that he was
[1:35:48] supposed to bring.
[1:35:51] Not not in the healing camp. I got that.
[1:35:53] I'm remember I skipped over that. He
[1:35:55] said, "Not in the healing campaign." So
[1:35:56] Jesus wasn't Jesus's healing campaign.
[1:35:58] It was Matthew 24.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Matthew 24. Jesus is going to lay it on
[1:36:03] the line and tell us exactly what's
[1:36:06] going to happen to this earth, to your
[1:36:08] earth, and what is going to happen in
[1:36:11] the
[1:36:13] religious realm. I may say the religious
[1:36:15] realm.
[1:36:18] Cuz remember, we're not in a religion.
[1:36:22] We're in a life. Listen, if you'll treat
[1:36:25] it more like a life than a religion,
[1:36:27] you'll come to church happy,
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; knowing that you're not just doing a
[1:36:32] service because uh you you know the the
[1:36:35] preacher tells you you got to come to
[1:36:36] church. No, the Holy Ghost ought to tell
[1:36:37] you you got to go to church.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; So, we've got the seals.
[1:36:48] Jesus is getting ready to tell them.
[1:36:50] We're just going to do one. I was going
[1:36:52] to try to get through with all of them,
[1:36:53] but we'll just do one today. We'll do
[1:36:55] the rest the next week. Don't want to
[1:36:58] wear you out. It is hot up here. It's 73
[1:37:01] degrees. Where's Aaron when you need
[1:37:03] him?
[1:37:07] It's okay. We'll be done in a minute.
[1:37:09] I'll wake him up. We'll go home. Well,
[1:37:11] no, we got to take communion. So, yeah,
[1:37:13] open the door. Listen, I want y'all to
[1:37:15] be careful, though. In the morning, it's
[1:37:16] going to be really cold. So, be careful
[1:37:19] with your plants and animals and your uh
[1:37:21] water cuz it's going to be really cold
[1:37:24] in the teens. So, just throw that in
[1:37:27] there. So, there's
[1:37:30] a scripture that's going to be Now,
[1:37:31] remember when Jesus is speaking this, I
[1:37:33] want you to get this just a second. When
[1:37:34] Jesus is speaking this, Paul had not
[1:37:37] been to had not been to Patmas. There
[1:37:40] was no book of Revelations. I mean,
[1:37:42] Jesus was literally writing the book.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:46] There was nobody writing it down. But
[1:37:48] afterwards, Matthew, the Holy Spirit
[1:37:50] brings him back to that day and says,
[1:37:53] "Write what Jesus said." Right? And he
[1:37:55] wrote it down. Then what happened was is
[1:37:58] when John goes to the aisle of Patmas,
[1:38:00] he sees the seals.
[1:38:03] All right? But now remember, he doesn't
[1:38:06] go back and say, "Well, that's what I
[1:38:08] heard." Because remember, he was here.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; He was here with Jesus. He was one of
[1:38:12] those 12. He heard this and heard that
[1:38:16] and didn't put them together. Why? It
[1:38:18] wasn't time for the revelation yet. Time
[1:38:21] for the revelation was when brother
[1:38:22] Brandham comes to the sixth seal and he
[1:38:24] says, "Wow,
[1:38:26] this Jesus already preached the seals.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; He'd already preached them 2,000 years
[1:38:31] ago in Matthew 24 because the Holy
[1:38:34] Spirit told him where to go back in the
[1:38:36] scripture to look for it." Listen, I was
[1:38:40] thinking about this the other day
[1:38:41] because I was listening to brother
[1:38:42] Brandham and he said or or we were it
[1:38:44] was in a book and he said when the angel
[1:38:47] of the Lord comes and tells me
[1:38:50] something. Now what brother Ram say he
[1:38:52] did he jumped up, shouted, wrote it down
[1:38:54] and went out and preached it. No, he
[1:38:56] said the angel of the Lord would take me
[1:38:59] back to a scripture in the Bible. I knew
[1:39:02] it was of the Lord when he would take me
[1:39:04] back to the very scripture that would
[1:39:06] identify what the angel was saying. So
[1:39:09] that's the same way with me and you. You
[1:39:11] and I listen the angel of the Lord.
[1:39:15] I hope he doesn't scare you.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; But he's ever present. HE'S THE ONE THAT
[1:39:20] GIVES YOU THAT. AND IF HE'LL give you
[1:39:22] something and you take it back to the
[1:39:24] Bible and it coincides, it can't be the
[1:39:26] devil.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; He will not coincide with the word of
[1:39:30] God.
[1:39:32] But you can realize that if you got
[1:39:34] scripture to back up what God's told
[1:39:36] you, that's of God.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; You're not a I'm not a prophetic person.
[1:39:43] We are prophetic people.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; So God can speak to you just as he
[1:39:47] speaks to me.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; So Jesus answered and said unto them,
[1:39:52] "Take heed that no man deceive you. For
[1:39:54] many shall come in my name and shall say
[1:39:56] I am Christ and shall deceive many." He
[1:39:59] didn't say few. He said many. Now,
[1:40:02] brother Ram on the sixth seal, he's
[1:40:03] going to read it and we'll read it here.
[1:40:05] Notice now we're going to read first.
[1:40:08] Excuse me. Then he answered them and
[1:40:10] then he's going to start to answer now
[1:40:13] and we want to compare it with the
[1:40:14] seals. Now watch the first seals.
[1:40:16] Revelation 6:1. Now we read 61. And I
[1:40:19] saw the lamb when he had opened one of
[1:40:21] the seals and I heard it was a noise of
[1:40:23] thunder and one of the four beasts
[1:40:25] saying come and see. And I saw, and
[1:40:27] behold, a white horse, and he that sat
[1:40:29] on him had a bow, and a crown was given
[1:40:31] unto him, and he went forth conquering
[1:40:34] and to conquer. Who did we find this
[1:40:36] fellow was? Antichrist.
[1:40:39] Okay. So close to Christ, but anti.
[1:40:44] Who did we find this fellow was?
[1:40:46] Antichrist. Matthew 24 now 4 and 5. And
[1:40:49] he's going to reread the scripture. Take
[1:40:51] heed that no man deceive you
[1:40:55] for many shall come in my name saying I
[1:40:56] am Christ and shall deceive many. See it
[1:40:59] antichrist there's your seal. So the
[1:41:01] first seal and they even asked brother
[1:41:03] Rom they said the first seal is that man
[1:41:05] of sin first Thessalonians and he said
[1:41:07] yes. So what's happening? Jesus is
[1:41:10] telling them, "Look, look out. There's
[1:41:12] going to be some people that's going to
[1:41:15] stand up in a pull pit and say that they
[1:41:19] are of the Lord,"
[1:41:21] and they're not.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Okay? Take heed that no man deceive you.
[1:41:27] For many shall come in my name, many,
[1:41:29] saying, "I am Christ," and shall deceive
[1:41:32] many. Because look, it's a white horse.
[1:41:36] It's a man.
[1:41:38] He's got a bow and he's going forth
[1:41:41] conquering into conqueror. Sounds like a
[1:41:43] pretty good guy. But remember, it's the
[1:41:45] devil.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; It's a white righteous
[1:41:51] church. A white righteous horse. A horse
[1:41:54] is a power. And it's the power over the
[1:41:59] people that looks good. We were talking
[1:42:02] about something or me and brother boy
[1:42:03] were talking about last night about
[1:42:05] these people that these singers that are
[1:42:07] singing Christian music. I mean, you
[1:42:09] can't tell them from rock stars.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; They're all tatted up. They got long
[1:42:13] hair. They got, you know, that
[1:42:17] there's got to be a standard, folks.
[1:42:18] There's got to be a separation.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; I mean, Brother Gary, when we listen to
[1:42:23] Old Southern Gospel, them old guys, they
[1:42:26] had short hair. and have no tattoos and
[1:42:29] they would sing some good old gospel
[1:42:30] music. Well, that's good. Yeah. Wore
[1:42:32] tie, brother Donnie. They wore ties.
[1:42:34] They didn't wear um shirt down to here
[1:42:36] and you know, tatted up everywhere. No,
[1:42:38] they wore suits most of the time. But
[1:42:41] you know what? They reverence God.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; These people don't reverence God.
[1:42:45] They're not even singing to God. They're
[1:42:46] thinking singing to the devil.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Come on
[1:42:51] now. We may take the song as a brother
[1:42:54] said, brother Tim Crossy. He can take
[1:42:56] that same song
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; by inspiration of the Holy Ghost though
[1:43:01] and make those lyrics come to life,
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Because they do sing songs by
[1:43:05] inspiration. Listen, Satan is an
[1:43:07] inspiration person.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; But so is God.
[1:43:13] God could have them write them songs
[1:43:15] just for us to sing it in a spiritual
[1:43:18] way of the bride of Jesus Christ to help
[1:43:21] the bride
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; and it not have nothing to do. The world
[1:43:25] just shouts and screams and praises the
[1:43:26] Lord and and they're not even worshiping
[1:43:28] God.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; They're worshiping the devil. Because if
[1:43:33] he says, "Take heed that no man deceive
[1:43:36] you," somebody's going to try.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Right? For many shall come in my name,
[1:43:43] saying, "I am Christ," and shall deceive
[1:43:46] many. Remember, Brother Rime tells us,
[1:43:48] he said, "The guy's got a bow with no
[1:43:50] arrows." He's a bluff.
[1:43:53] So, Satan is bluffing us into believing
[1:43:56] that he's God. Bluffing us into
[1:43:59] believing he has the answer.
[1:44:04] You got to know, folks. You know why?
[1:44:06] We'll read we'll read one later on, but
[1:44:07] won't read it this this time, but but
[1:44:10] Jesus all he stands and he tells them,
[1:44:12] he said, "Now, somebody's going to come
[1:44:13] and tell you that Christ is over here in
[1:44:15] this place,
[1:44:17] that you need to go over there."
[1:44:20] Well, if you don't have the Holy Ghost,
[1:44:21] you're going to chase you're going to
[1:44:22] chase your tail. As the old as the old
[1:44:24] saying says, you're going to go from one
[1:44:26] church to the other just chasing your
[1:44:27] tail. But when you know that, and I
[1:44:30] ain't talking about a church, I'm
[1:44:31] talking about you individually, your
[1:44:32] person. You if you got the Holy Ghost,
[1:44:35] he will only feed on the word of God.
[1:44:38] And I'm sorry,
[1:44:40] but he's not going to feed off of good
[1:44:42] music.
[1:44:46] That's secondary.
[1:44:48] Amen.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; The word of God is more important to God
[1:44:51] than the singing.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; because the devil is a worship angel. He
[1:44:58] loves to worship. Now, they got those
[1:45:00] worship centers and they got, like I
[1:45:01] said, rock concerts. They got them
[1:45:02] lights and and uh fog machines and all
[1:45:05] that stuff. God's not in that, folks.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; He was in a manger,
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; laid down in an old manger.
[1:45:16] And I was reading yesterday there was a
[1:45:19] a Jewish person was telling a a story
[1:45:21] that that in Bethlehem,
[1:45:24] think about it. In Bethlehem, the
[1:45:26] mangers were not wood.
[1:45:30] They were made out of stone.
[1:45:34] They were heuned out of stone. And there
[1:45:36] was a bowl hume because
[1:45:40] you ready?
[1:45:42] When lambs were born, they couldn't be
[1:45:45] born in straw. They had to be born
[1:45:49] in that manger.
[1:45:51] So, we always thought it was like a
[1:45:52] trough where somebody was eating
[1:45:54] something. No, it's a place where baby
[1:45:57] lambs are born.
[1:46:02] He out of a rock.
[1:46:06] heun out of a rock and they showed a
[1:46:08] picture of one of them and that's where
[1:46:10] the lambs were born so they could take
[1:46:12] care of them, keep them from being cold
[1:46:13] and you know you know washing them and
[1:46:15] all that stuff the guy showed and it's
[1:46:17] just a a hollowed out stone.
[1:46:22] He was born. They laid him on a stone.
[1:46:26] He died.
[1:46:28] They laid him on a stone.
[1:46:31] But that second stone,
[1:46:34] it got rolled away.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; That second stone, they might have laid
[1:46:38] that human body down there, but God
[1:46:39] never laid in that tomb. God was already
[1:46:42] gone
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; before they put him in that tomb.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet.
[1:46:49] God
[1:46:50] is a God that he will use those little
[1:46:54] things like that because I told you
[1:46:55] about Bethlehem. That was a place where
[1:46:57] that was a place where the the barley
[1:46:59] and the wheat was. So there was the
[1:47:01] there was a bread of life being born in
[1:47:02] in Bethlehem. And then I read that the
[1:47:05] other day where they they uh you know
[1:47:08] heed out of place
[1:47:10] and that's where the baby lamb they'd
[1:47:12] bring him in. They'd birthe him there
[1:47:14] and then they'd take him out and put him
[1:47:16] in the field. But that's where he was
[1:47:18] born. Laid him in swaddling clothes and
[1:47:20] li lay him in a manger.
[1:47:23] Cuz remember he really was he really was
[1:47:25] born in a ca it was a cave. You know we
[1:47:28] think about a manger. We think about a a
[1:47:30] barn with stalls.
[1:47:32] It wasn't barn with stalls.
[1:47:35] It was a place hun in the mountain and
[1:47:38] they would hue little places and that's
[1:47:40] where they would put their animals to
[1:47:42] get them out of the weather. So, it was
[1:47:44] in a rock.
[1:47:46] It wasn't in a it wasn't in a wood
[1:47:48] building. They there's not hardly any
[1:47:49] wood over there. So, they use a it's
[1:47:51] like a cave almost.
[1:47:54] And that cave is where that they put
[1:47:56] their animals at. So there was no room
[1:47:58] in the end. So they put him in the barn,
[1:48:01] but the barn wasn't the barn wasn't
[1:48:04] wood. The barn was made out of rock.
[1:48:06] He's a rock of our salvation. Everything
[1:48:08] to do with him is a rock cuz he's solid.
[1:48:11] You look at that rock of Jibralta. That
[1:48:14] thing's been there for millions of
[1:48:15] years.
[1:48:17] One day it's going to go away. But
[1:48:19] there's a rock that you and I depend on
[1:48:22] that'll never go away. It's actually
[1:48:24] going to roll down. It's going to roll
[1:48:26] down through your life and it's going to
[1:48:28] crush everything in front of it.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; The stone that cut out of without hands,
[1:48:34] we say, "Oh, that's Jesus." That's
[1:48:36] right. But where is he today? He's
[1:48:38] inside of you. He's rolling all those
[1:48:40] other things away. He's rolling the
[1:48:42] reproach away. He's showing you that
[1:48:44] you've got grace and mercy and all that
[1:48:47] that you
[1:48:49] can be saved. You can have a chance for
[1:48:53] eternal life. I think underneath that is
[1:48:55] the the uh
[1:48:59] Yeah.
[1:49:01] Okay. But we're going to take communion
[1:49:03] and we got this here real quick.
[1:49:07] It's only been an hour. Thought I'd been
[1:49:08] up here longer than that. But communion
[1:49:12] time.
[1:49:16] Like I said before, I would have I would
[1:49:18] have liked to have been in that upper
[1:49:19] room.
[1:49:21] But if you'll read the commentary of
[1:49:22] that upper room, nobody understood what
[1:49:24] that what he was doing.
[1:49:26] Eat my flesh, drink my blood, drink
[1:49:28] this, and eat that. And and and I'm
[1:49:30] going to wash your feet and and you
[1:49:32] know, you should do the same thing. And
[1:49:34] they didn't understand. But remember,
[1:49:36] I'll read it to you in a minute. Jesus
[1:49:38] comes down. He says, "What you don't
[1:49:40] know now, you'll know hereafter."
[1:49:42] Why? cuz he was going to that very man's
[1:49:44] going to come back and go inside of
[1:49:46] those people and change them. If we'll
[1:49:49] ever realize that that same God is
[1:49:51] inside of you today
[1:49:54] and today you know who he is. They
[1:49:57] didn't know who he was back in that
[1:49:59] upper room. Come on people. They
[1:50:01] scattered like rats the next day. Sorry,
[1:50:04] I don't want to say rats, but they
[1:50:05] scattered. There was nobody there. He
[1:50:08] died alone. The Bible says
[1:50:11] the scripture said they all ran away
[1:50:13] from him. Peter cursed against him.
[1:50:15] Didn't want him have nothing to do with
[1:50:16] him. But oh, on the day of Pentecost,
[1:50:19] that curse got lifted.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; When the curse got lifted, he said,
[1:50:23] "This is that which was spoken by the
[1:50:26] prophet Joel that I'll pour out my
[1:50:28] spirit upon all flesh." You love the
[1:50:31] Lord.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; We do this in remembrance of him,
[1:50:35] knowing that one day we're going to do
[1:50:36] this with him.
[1:50:38] For I have received of the Lord that
[1:50:40] which also I delivered unto you. That
[1:50:41] the Lord Jesus the same night in which
[1:50:43] he was betrayed took bread. And when he
[1:50:45] had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[1:50:46] "Take, eat. This is my body which is
[1:50:49] broken for you. This do in remembrance
[1:50:51] of me." After the same manner also he
[1:50:54] took the cup, and when he had sucked,
[1:50:55] saying, "This cup is the new testament
[1:50:58] in my blood." No more animal sacrifices.
[1:51:01] All right? This was the blood of God.
[1:51:03] This was the life of God that was in the
[1:51:06] blood. the New Testament. In my blood,
[1:51:08] this do you as often as you drink it in
[1:51:09] remembrance of me. For as often as you
[1:51:12] eat this bread and drink this cup, you
[1:51:14] do show the Lord's death till he comes.
[1:51:17] Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this
[1:51:19] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:51:20] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:51:22] and blood of the Lord. But let a man
[1:51:25] examine himself, and so let him eat of
[1:51:26] that bread and drink of that cup. For he
[1:51:29] that eateth and drinkketh unworthily
[1:51:31] eateth and drinkketh damnation to
[1:51:32] himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
[1:51:35] For this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:51:37] among you. Many sleep.
[1:51:40] For if we would judge ourselves, we
[1:51:42] should not be judged. I'll explain that
[1:51:44] one day. That's a whole sermon. But I've
[1:51:46] got some commentary on that that I want
[1:51:48] to. Brother Bram never really said
[1:51:49] anything much about it, but I I really
[1:51:51] enjoy because it says, right, if you
[1:51:52] just read it like it like you read, you
[1:51:54] got to read between the lines. For if we
[1:51:56] would judge ourselves, we should not be
[1:51:58] judged. In other words, if we judge
[1:51:59] ourselves, we're not going we're going
[1:52:00] to judge oursel perfect. That's not what
[1:52:02] they're saying. But when we are judged,
[1:52:06] we are chasen of the Lord. Now let's
[1:52:08] bring him in. And that we should not be
[1:52:11] condemned with the world.
[1:52:15] Wherefore, my brethren, when you come
[1:52:16] together to eat, tarry one for another,
[1:52:18] and if any man hunger, let him eat at
[1:52:20] home, that you come not together into
[1:52:22] condemnation, and the rest will I set in
[1:52:24] order when I come. Paul was always
[1:52:26] coming. I'm in second Corinthians
[1:52:28] reading now. And uh Corinthians were a
[1:52:32] little bit of um a trouble for Paul.
[1:52:36] They were heathens. They were idol
[1:52:38] worshippers. They did things they wasn't
[1:52:40] supposed to do. They eat things they
[1:52:41] wasn't supposed to eat. They instead of
[1:52:43] taking communion, they were having this
[1:52:45] big feast and getting drunk and at the
[1:52:48] Lord's table. And that's why Paul had to
[1:52:50] come and straighten that out. He brought
[1:52:52] that to the Corinthians and told him
[1:52:53] said, "Look, this is what you got to do.
[1:52:55] You don't do you don't do what you're
[1:52:57] doing. You can go eat at home." Remember
[1:52:58] he says you go if you want if you're
[1:53:00] hungry go eat at home that you come not
[1:53:02] together in condemnation. So what he
[1:53:04] said was this is a solemn event that
[1:53:07] we're going to take the bread and the
[1:53:08] wine. There's not going to be any
[1:53:09] laughing cutting up. We're not going
[1:53:11] we're not going to get full over this.
[1:53:13] We're not going to get fat.
[1:53:15] This is a solemn
[1:53:18] one of the ordinances that Jesus left us
[1:53:20] to do in remembrance of him. So let's
[1:53:22] just do it today and don't remember
[1:53:25] nothing else but him. Let's just think
[1:53:26] about him. Listen, if he'll get if
[1:53:29] you'll get him on his m on your mind,
[1:53:31] he'll come to you. I promise you.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; But you got to do that. You say, "Well,
[1:53:34] I'm not going to take communion because
[1:53:36] somebody's watching me or I'm not going
[1:53:37] to wash feet because I'm it ain't
[1:53:39] somebody that's going to get you to
[1:53:40] heaven."
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus is the one that's going
[1:53:44] to get you to heaven. And you may have
[1:53:46] to stand alone for this.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. You may have to do this
[1:53:51] all alone. He's not taking a group. He's
[1:53:54] taking individuals, right?
[1:53:57] So, let's bow our heads just for a
[1:53:58] moment. Let's Terry and uh get these
[1:54:02] things out of the way so we can take
[1:54:03] this communion
[1:54:05] with a pure heart.
[1:54:15] Lord, help us all. Lord, be with each
[1:54:18] one. Lord, it's here that we do focus
[1:54:22] totally on you, Father, and nothing
[1:54:24] else. Jesus name we pray.
[1:54:26] Amen. Bible said he took bread and he
[1:54:29] blessed it. Heavenly Father, Lord, thank
[1:54:31] you for this bread been made and
[1:54:34] prepared by holy hands the way that you
[1:54:36] told us to do it, Father, with no
[1:54:38] leaven, Lord. It's just the water and
[1:54:42] the the bread there, Lord, and that's
[1:54:44] it. And father, it's not made to be
[1:54:47] where we feast on it, but it's made to
[1:54:50] be remember you as you took stripes, you
[1:54:53] took holes in your body, you took a
[1:54:55] crown of thorns to have an imperfect
[1:54:57] body so that this bride will walk
[1:55:00] through an eternity with a perfect body.
[1:55:03] Father, just bless us now in Jesus name.
[1:55:06] Amen.
[1:55:08] He's the only God I know that can
[1:55:10] control everything, created everything.
[1:55:12] Brother Bram said, "Knows every nat that
[1:55:14] was ever on earth." How many times we b
[1:55:16] his eye?
[1:55:18] That's pretty great, isn't it?
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; But he came down so lowly as a baby and
[1:55:24] he said, "I'm going to go live with him.
[1:55:27] I'm going to go save him."
[1:55:29] And he did that.
[1:55:32] And I don't know if Jesus when he was a
[1:55:33] little kid knew he was going to die on
[1:55:34] the cross, but I knew there was certain
[1:55:36] time that he knew he was going to die.
[1:55:39] And he kept telling them he was going to
[1:55:40] have to go away. They didn't understand
[1:55:42] it. They weren't even thinking about
[1:55:45] this man being crucified while he parted
[1:55:47] water or he walked on water. He he
[1:55:49] turned water into wine. He healed blind
[1:55:52] man. He raised, you know, three people
[1:55:54] from the dead. He cast out demons from
[1:55:56] legion. Who can hurt him?
[1:56:00] Oh my.
[1:56:03] He wasn't taking it for him. He was
[1:56:05] taking it for us.
[1:56:07] He was taking it so that you and I by
[1:56:11] his stripes. Anybody sick today?
[1:56:14] By his stripes, you're healed.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; By his stripes, if you believe that by
[1:56:19] his stripes, you are healed today. You
[1:56:22] say, "Well, I didn't feel anything." I
[1:56:24] didn't ask you, "Did you feel healed?"
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; I told you that the Bible says you are
[1:56:28] healed.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; So, you just walk on with that.
[1:56:34] Don't look back. Circumstances, don't
[1:56:36] worry about it.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; Circumstances, look, circumstances comes
[1:56:40] from the devil.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; God's over here, you're healed.
[1:56:44] Circumstances of the devil. Let's bow
[1:56:47] our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, this
[1:56:48] wine has been made, Lord, for one
[1:56:50] purpose, and that's Lord, to give to you
[1:56:52] your bride. And Lord, it's a time where
[1:56:55] we we know it's not your blood, but it's
[1:56:57] a symbol, Lord, that your blood dropped
[1:56:59] at Calvary. and that the life that you
[1:57:02] had inside of you, Lord, it come back
[1:57:03] into the believer. And you ask us to do
[1:57:06] these few ordinances, Lord, to to just
[1:57:09] bring us back to our remembrance of what
[1:57:11] happened that day, Lord, and for us to
[1:57:13] remember you and not forget Calvary and
[1:57:16] not forget what you done for us, Father.
[1:57:18] Just be with us now in the further of
[1:57:20] this service in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:57:24] Come morning
[1:57:26] I'll walk by the river
[1:57:32] I'll rest me rest

[1:57:44] carry that cross midnight
[1:57:48] but come morning there's glory
[1:57:52] for me.
[1:57:55] Sometimes I'm despised
[1:57:59] and rejected
[1:58:02] and I question, "Oh, Father,
[1:58:06] how long?"
[1:58:10] Then I take one more look
[1:58:14] at Mount Calvary
[1:58:18] and it gives me the strength to go on,
[1:58:24] you know,
[1:58:26] and I we we're positive people. I know
[1:58:29] that. But, you know, I was walking I was
[1:58:31] going to Walmart yesterday and
[1:58:34] I got out of the truck. You know, my
[1:58:35] legs my knees killing me and um but it's
[1:58:38] just symptoms. But uh I go wobbling into
[1:58:42] Walmart. Well, you know what? God just
[1:58:43] sent a man with a half a leg by me.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; I said, "God, forgive forgive me.
[1:58:50] Forgive me. Forgive me.
[1:58:55] Don't worry about that no more."
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; And then there was one, no, I'm not done
[1:59:00] yet. Then God wasn't done with me yet.
[1:59:03] Sometimes I have to have two or three
[1:59:05] things happen. But there was one walked
[1:59:07] by me and he had a cane and he had his
[1:59:09] he had that one of them braces on with
[1:59:11] the metal things on it, you know, with
[1:59:13] the that helps you knee like we did in
[1:59:16] football on your knee. And he was just
[1:59:18] Yeah. brace. And he was just wobbling
[1:59:20] like crazy on a cane. I thought, "Well,
[1:59:21] okay, Lord. I feel good. I'm fine. I'm
[1:59:26] going to just walk the best I can and
[1:59:29] and I ain't worried about it no more."
[1:59:31] But you know, really, sometimes you you
[1:59:33] have a pity party. What does God do?
[1:59:35] He'll send somebody by worse
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; that's in worse shape than you are.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; You know what it makes you do? It makes
[1:59:42] you pray for that person because that
[1:59:43] one man was walking in front of me, I
[1:59:45] mean his leg was bowed bad. He was an
[1:59:47] older gentleman with a cane and I
[1:59:48] thought, Lord, just
[1:59:51] touch that man, you know. And I don't
[1:59:53] know, never meet him probably ever
[1:59:54] again,
[1:59:56] but he sure wasn't. Got out of the car
[1:59:57] in front of me and went walking down
[1:59:59] through there and there he was, you
[2:00:00] know, in the shape he was in. And I just
[2:00:02] said, "Okay, we're good.
[2:00:05] I just walked a little slower than I
[2:00:07] usually do. Maybe that's what the Lord
[2:00:09] wants me to do is slow down a little
[2:00:10] bit.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; But uh well, don't come on me, brother
[2:00:13] boy, to come on you, too.
[2:00:16] That man works more than 20 of us.
[2:00:19] Slow down, bro. Slow down.
[2:00:24] Enjoy
[2:00:25] life.
[2:00:28] Me and Brother Joe were talking about
[2:00:29] that a few minutes ago.
[2:00:31] This is all character building.
[2:00:34] If you can realize that though, it don't
[2:00:36] hurt. It don't hurt as bad. How could
[2:00:39] you be? What if you were somebody that
[2:00:42] did not know God? Now, see, we can't
[2:00:45] fathom that because we know God. But
[2:00:48] there are some people out there that
[2:00:49] just, you know, thinks we're just
[2:00:53] willy-nilly through life and and we're
[2:00:55] going to wind up just like Jim's brother
[2:00:57] did. You know, we we're going to just
[2:01:00] we're gone. You know, there's nothing
[2:01:02] left. After this, I'm gonna tell him one
[2:01:05] more time. When I see him, I'm gonna
[2:01:06] say, "When you close your eyes, you
[2:01:07] gonna open them up somewhere.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; You're gonna open them up somewhere."
[2:01:13] But to know the truth,
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; it takes the fear out.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Get Luis in the back there,
[2:01:19] please. It it it takes care
[2:01:22] of the fear,
[2:01:26] right? Come on, somebody. It takes care
[2:01:29] of the fear.
[2:01:31] And I know there's times when we do we
[2:01:33] we you need to just question yourself.
[2:01:35] Don't question God. Don't ever question
[2:01:38] him. We can question oursel, but don't
[2:01:41] question God.
[2:01:43] But when we come down to it, if we're
[2:01:46] his, brother Donnie, he can't let us go.
[2:01:50] We're engraved in the palm of his hand.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; There's nowhere else we can go
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; except in him. And that's exactly what
[2:01:58] we're doing. We're getting in him.
[2:02:01] a bunch of believers
[2:02:03] that uh
[2:02:07] that assembled together
[2:02:10] under one message.
[2:02:12] We believe brother Rhyn was a prophet
[2:02:14] but that message came from Jesus Christ.
[2:02:17] Amen.
[2:02:19] Can it came through a conduit just like
[2:02:21] it did today. I believe you know come
[2:02:22] through a conduit but he they come to
[2:02:25] you.
[2:02:26] Jesus come to save you. Brother Ram
[2:02:28] didn't come to save you. He came to tell
[2:02:30] you about the Savior. That's what I'm
[2:02:33] doing today. I'm telling you about the
[2:02:34] Savior and what he's done for us. And he
[2:02:36] did send us a prophet. And that prophet
[2:02:38] did tell us we were prophetic people.
[2:02:40] And that we could just not read.
[2:02:42] Remember he said one time he said,
[2:02:43] "Don't read the Bible like a newspaper."
[2:02:46] I mean, sometimes I think we do. We just
[2:02:49] read the stories. And we go, "Well, I
[2:02:51] read my I read my two chapters today and
[2:02:54] I'm good. Put the Bible up. do something
[2:02:57] else.
[2:03:00] Yeah. But but when you know what you're
[2:03:02] doing, you know, you read you kind of
[2:03:04] read a few scriptures. I'd rather read
[2:03:05] three scriptures with inspiration than
[2:03:07] to read a whole Bible without
[2:03:08] inspiration.
[2:03:10] Amen. Where you know what God's talking
[2:03:12] and and I see that he's talking to me. I
[2:03:15] don't know about y'all, but he's talking
[2:03:16] to me when he when he when he wrote this
[2:03:18] whole book is to talk to me and to you,
[2:03:21] too. God bless you. Let's take
[2:03:22] communion.
[2:03:39] Thank you, brother.
[2:03:42] Let's uh read a foot washing scripture.
[2:03:55] I want to set the timeline up. I I the
[2:03:57] Lord just told me that I didn't get out
[2:04:00] of the car and see the guy with no leg.
[2:04:01] That was later on. But it was put in
[2:04:03] front of me and so was the guy that got
[2:04:05] out of the car that had the bum leg. So
[2:04:07] they were all there in Walmart together
[2:04:09] just for me.
[2:04:11] Is that why you go to Walmart? Just for
[2:04:13] you?
[2:04:18] They they went for them not knowing they
[2:04:20] went for me.
[2:04:24] Listen,
[2:04:26] the footstep of the righteous order of
[2:04:28] the Lord. So whatever happens in our
[2:04:30] life, we may think it's bad.
[2:04:36] But how many times have we went through
[2:04:38] this situation,
[2:04:40] wondered how in the world God would let
[2:04:42] that happen, and then know that's the
[2:04:44] only way it h could happen to get the
[2:04:46] results that he got.
[2:04:50] See, that's having patience with God,
[2:04:52] knowing that he can do what he said he
[2:04:54] would do. You know what brother Ram
[2:04:55] said, have patience. He said, first
[2:04:57] thing is have patience with God, knowing
[2:04:58] he knows what he's doing. And we don't
[2:05:00] get in the middle of the program.
[2:05:03] We just want to be part of the program.
[2:05:06] Supper having ended, the devil having
[2:05:08] now put in the heart of Judas's carrot,
[2:05:09] Simon's son, to betray him. Jesus
[2:05:11] knowing that the father had given all
[2:05:13] things into his hands and that he was
[2:05:15] come from God and he went to God. He
[2:05:17] rise from supper and laid aside his
[2:05:19] garment and took a towel and girded
[2:05:20] himself. After that he pou water into a
[2:05:23] basin and began to wash the disciples
[2:05:24] feet and wipe them with a towel
[2:05:26] wherewith he was girded. Then cometh he
[2:05:28] to Simon Peter and Peter said unto him,
[2:05:30] Lord, dust thou wash my feet? Jesus said
[2:05:33] unto him, what I do, thou knowest not
[2:05:35] now? Here's the scripture. But thou
[2:05:36] shalt know hereafter. Who was the
[2:05:38] spokesman on the day of Pentecost? That
[2:05:41] same guy that said, "You ain't ever
[2:05:42] washing my feet."
[2:05:45] The same guy that says, "You never
[2:05:47] washing my feet."
[2:05:49] Well, he had a awakening when on the day
[2:05:52] of Pentecost, didn't he? Peter said unto
[2:05:54] him, "Thou shalt never wash my feet."
[2:05:57] Jesus answered him, "If I wash thee not,
[2:05:59] thou has no part with me." Simon Peter
[2:06:01] said unto him, Lord, not my feet only,
[2:06:03] but also my hands and my head.
[2:06:06] Jesus said unto him, "He that is washed,
[2:06:07] neither not saved to wash his feet, but
[2:06:09] is clean every wit. But you are clean,
[2:06:11] but not all. For he knew who should
[2:06:14] betray him." And therefore he said, "You
[2:06:15] are not all clean."
[2:06:17] So after he had washed their feet and
[2:06:19] had taken his garment, was sat down
[2:06:20] again, he said unto them, "Know you what
[2:06:22] I have done to you?" He asked him a
[2:06:24] question. You call me Master and Lord,
[2:06:25] and you say, "Well, for so I am. If I
[2:06:28] then, your Lord and Master have washed
[2:06:29] your feet, you also ought to wash one
[2:06:32] another's feet. For I have given you an
[2:06:34] example that you should do as I have
[2:06:36] done to you.
[2:06:39] Verily, verily, I say unto you, the
[2:06:41] servant is not greater than his Lord,
[2:06:42] neither he that is sent greater than he
[2:06:44] that sent him. If you know these things,
[2:06:46] happy are ye if you do them. Amen. Let's
[2:06:50] bow our heads. Dear heavenly father,
[2:06:52] we've had a day today, Lord, with a uh
[2:06:55] appreciation of the time of the year,
[2:06:57] Lord, with our our young people, Lord,
[2:06:59] and our and our ones that were the
[2:07:01] directors. we pray that you'd give them
[2:07:03] a special blessing today because that
[2:07:04] was that was wonderful. Touched our
[2:07:06] heart as uh I was watching my wife and
[2:07:10] she was crying. I said, "What are you
[2:07:11] crying for?" She said, "Brother Dale
[2:07:13] would be happy to see this."
[2:07:17] Lord may look over the banister of time
[2:07:21] and just look down and see the group
[2:07:22] that he so fervently
[2:07:26] spent his life
[2:07:29] helping to build. Lord, now I pray Lord
[2:07:32] that you would take over
[2:07:35] this whole group of people.
[2:07:38] And Lord, let it be you that leads us
[2:07:40] and guides us on through. Lord,
[2:07:43] forgive us of our faults and failures
[2:07:44] and our ideas that are contrary to you.
[2:07:47] Lord, we we pray that you would sanctify
[2:07:50] us, Lord, for this journey. Wash us. And
[2:07:52] as brother Luis was saying, when we
[2:07:54] cross over cross over into the promised
[2:07:57] land, there had to be a second
[2:07:58] circumcision. Well, Lord, Lord, if
[2:08:01] there's anything that's extra, Lord, we
[2:08:04] need it cut off. Anything of the world,
[2:08:07] Lord, Lord, cut it off so we can We want
[2:08:11] to have the full run of the promised
[2:08:14] land. We want every promise. That's why
[2:08:15] it was called a promised land, Lord,
[2:08:17] because you promised them they could
[2:08:18] have it. And if you make a promise,
[2:08:21] you're going to make sure somebody's
[2:08:22] going to make it. Well, Father, you
[2:08:24] promised us you'd send us a prophet, and
[2:08:26] you did. You promised us promised us
[2:08:28] you'd send us a five-fold ministry that
[2:08:30] had the word of God. And you have and
[2:08:33] you promised us that we would come to a
[2:08:34] body change.
[2:08:37] So Lord, your promises are yay and amen.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; Lord, just bless us now in the further
[2:08:42] of the journey. Be with the ones that
[2:08:43] are traveling on the highways. Lord, be
[2:08:46] with us now, Lord, until we come back
[2:08:47] together. Bless brother Manuel, Lord, on
[2:08:50] Wednesday night, Lord, to bring the
[2:08:51] words of eternal life. Father, just give
[2:08:53] us this daily bread today in Jesus name.
[2:08:55] Amen. God bless you sisters. Go
[2:08:57] downstairs.
