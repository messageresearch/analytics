[12:44] holy I want to see
[12:49] you amen amen praise the Lord thank
[12:54] you well it's good to be here again
[12:57] amen and uh we was here
[13:02] last Saturday for the last wave goodbye
[13:06] to brother
[13:09] Samuel and
[13:11] uh I think the first time I met brother
[13:15] Samuel he had come down with brother Moz
[13:17] to brother Do's Church in Augusta
[13:19] Georgia y'all may be seated for just a
[13:23] moment and
[13:27] uh it was a n
[13:30] 18 73 I
[13:34] think so 71 was when the assembly here
[13:39] the
[13:40] church started what did it start on July
[13:43] the 4th or
[13:46] okay and uh so that's been
[13:49] 53 years
[13:53] ago so a lot of water under the
[13:57] bridge and
[14:00] brother Moes you know he served the
[14:03] church Faithfully while he was amen
[14:06] ministering and and then brother Samuel
[14:10] come in behind them and they both had
[14:14] similar uh Ministries being brother
[14:17] Samuel was kind of coming up under
[14:20] brother Moz not that we're
[14:22] just
[14:24] uh uh just repeating one another but uh
[14:28] some times you have teaching Ministries
[14:31] that that kind of they they come
[14:34] together amen and so then this church
[14:37] has been under a Teaching Ministry for a
[14:39] long
[14:41] time I remember one
[14:44] time I don't know if it was it probably
[14:47] wasn't you I think you was probably out
[14:49] in the world at the
[14:51] time making your uh
[14:55] Footprints you know and uh it's not
[14:59] where you've been it's where you are
[15:01] that
[15:03] counts but I think brother Dale had or
[15:06] Samuel uh had been preaching on the
[15:09] seals and uh back in those days it was
[15:12] on
[15:13] cassettes so I thought well somebody
[15:16] gave me some some tapes on it it was a
[15:19] whole box and that wasn't all probably
[15:23] first or second seal you
[15:25] know yeah they say that you know
[15:29] and whenever he uh I think it's been
[15:32] said plow a field he plows every corner
[15:35] of it and when you come in behind them
[15:37] there ain't much left to
[15:40] plow and so I thought 53 years of
[15:44] Teaching Ministry and now brother Wade
[15:47] Dale taking up the chip off his daddy's
[15:51] block from here up up in heaven not
[15:54] brother Samuel but the Lord Jesus Christ
[15:58] and also a a chip off of his
[16:01] daddy's uh side as it
[16:04] was I don't like to say block you know
[16:07] that be indicated you Blockhead but I
[16:10] wouldn't want say that I had to say that
[16:13] because he when you get back here and
[16:15] you're trying to be serious he's you
[16:19] know you have a difficult time trying to
[16:22] meditate let me say
[16:24] that but uh it was a pleasure and an
[16:28] honor to know brother Samuel and his
[16:33] dedication and
[16:35] uh he he he wasn't one for just Fly by
[16:39] Night things you know it's kind of like
[16:42] Peter said I think it's first Peter or
[16:44] second Peter 1 and10 he said make your
[16:47] calling an election sure amen now your
[16:50] calling an election by nature is sure
[16:55] because God don't do something
[16:57] haphazardly amen so it's sure but but
[17:01] God wants you to be
[17:03] sure and and that's where the Teaching
[17:06] Ministry comes in the Evangelist of
[17:08] course catches the the individual and
[17:11] brings them under
[17:13] condemnation not by emotions but by the
[17:16] Holy Spirit true con uh
[17:18] conviction and then he he's I find
[17:25] it when you get when you get saved and
[17:28] born again
[17:29] you don't really know what happens you
[17:32] just know something happen change your
[17:34] life something
[17:35] real it's like I've said about the Holy
[17:38] Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[17:42] is not so much of a
[17:44] birth understanding wise it's an event
[17:47] in your life that takes
[17:49] place but then when you start going to
[17:52] church you begin to look back and learn
[17:55] what
[17:56] happened and that's the anchor
[17:59] the anchor is not emotion right it's not
[18:03] a date it's not even when you your life
[18:06] changed somebody could convince you that
[18:08] it just religious
[18:10] motivation uh look at the Buddhists and
[18:12] how their lives change and then you
[18:14] start comparing your life you've got to
[18:16] find that experienced here in the
[18:19] scriptures that's right you have to make
[18:21] your calling
[18:23] election sure and if there ever was a
[18:27] time on this planet that people need to
[18:31] make their calling an election sure
[18:34] that's including your experience it's
[18:36] including the message it's now amen
[18:39] that's why we find that the Teaching
[18:42] Ministry is in uh uh prevalence it it's
[18:47] it's in the it's at the top yeah they
[18:51] Heap to themselves teachers not pastors
[18:55] not
[18:56] evangelists and this is the age that
[18:59] that God sent a a word
[19:01] prophit and then the ministry coming
[19:04] under that is influenced by that amen
[19:07] abely
[19:09] because this this you take your GPS this
[19:12] is the GPS age it where God lifted a
[19:16] prophet up into that watchman's Tower
[19:20] yes he did and he could look back and
[19:22] see where we were see where we're going
[19:26] and where we are this is the only age
[19:29] Luther couldn't do that Wesley couldn't
[19:30] do that so this is this is God's
[19:34] GPS age that he is opened up his word
[19:38] and lifted us up in the tower of the
[19:41] Watchman Amen in one voice one Lord one
[19:46] God
[19:48] Amen
[19:50] uh and we're right at the
[19:54] threshold so this this assembly has been
[19:59] been well taught yes sir I believe and
[20:02] brother Dale I believe is is is just as
[20:07] true as any person can be all we can do
[20:09] is is what God has allotted us to do
[20:12] with all of our hearts amen it's not a
[20:15] game it's not a
[20:18] business it's not some kind of right
[20:21] metal or
[20:23] identification and and you are
[20:26] not brother Dale's
[20:29] sheep come on I hate to say that it's
[20:32] true but he said brother Dale he said
[20:35] feed my sheep that's
[20:37] right so you're bought and paid for but
[20:41] God chooses who he wants to feed his
[20:44] sheep and it's important yes it is
[20:47] because if you get local weed or
[20:49] something that's right oh yeah crazy so
[20:53] uh it's been it's been a journey and
[20:57] we're still in this
[20:59] journey and I I thought about brother
[21:02] Samuel you know
[21:04] sometimes the enemy thinks because he
[21:06] take
[21:07] somebody that he's done got a
[21:10] victory but death was stripped at
[21:12] Calvary that's
[21:14] right and and God don't worry about
[21:17] whether you die or whether you live he
[21:19] doesn't worry about how much time is
[21:21] left in brother Wade's Life Time doesn't
[21:24] he's got everything under control
[21:29] and and so then that's where we have to
[21:32] we have to put our trust in him we honor
[21:35] God's servants yes sir and we can sit
[21:39] and listen to services that they've
[21:41] preached but he's a present
[21:45] God a present help in the day of
[21:48] trouble he's not up there on a
[21:51] cloud he's not over in the grave
[21:54] someplace brother brother Samuel's not
[21:57] even there righten I read his message to
[22:00] us he said he said don't cry he said I'm
[22:03] not here amen he said you can stand at
[22:07] the grave but I'm not here that's right
[22:10] he ain't
[22:12] there he's up there waiting on you and
[22:15] I with
[22:19] anticipation so I just pray the Lord
[22:21] would give us something this evening to
[22:24] speak on and I uh consider a privilege
[22:29] and honor to be here with brother Chris
[22:31] also and you other brothers uh it's
[22:35] always bad when you call somebody's name
[22:37] out you leave somebody out and I'm the
[22:39] world's worst for remembering names I
[22:42] remember faces and now I've got 81 years
[22:46] and memory is not really as good as it
[22:50] used to be I have to go through the
[22:52] alphabet two or three times before I can
[22:54] remember a
[22:56] name and then what I'm going through the
[22:59] alphabet about the second time Janet's
[23:02] going through it about the second time
[23:03] you don't found it yet no not yet where
[23:06] are you at I'm on S oh well I'm just on
[23:10] D it's it's amazing how it can uh jar
[23:15] the the memory but it's an honor to to
[23:19] be here in this assembly with you people
[23:22] children of God the purchase of God's
[23:24] blood you're more important than if we
[23:27] had a v they digging up artifacts trying
[23:30] to prove David was here trying to prove
[23:32] Saul was here trying to prove Jesus was
[23:35] here and and you know if they came with
[23:38] a charger of of that
[23:41] blood that that you could have stood
[23:43] there at Calvary and it could have run
[23:44] all over you we can pour it on you it
[23:46] wouldn't have done a bit of
[23:49] good so we're we're not we're not
[23:52] looking for some kind of a token like
[23:55] that no we're looking for a living Goden
[23:58] a living token a living
[24:01] people A peculiar people strange OD
[24:08] ball John said they didn't know him and
[24:12] they won't know you that's right because
[24:15] you're hid in Christ sometimes you oh
[24:18] I'm hid in Christ but sometimes it's not
[24:21] always a blessing because people look at
[24:23] you and you look like some kind of a
[24:25] foreign object because you're hid from
[24:28] them in
[24:30] Christ but there's somebody out there
[24:33] looking for the light of a
[24:36] candle and when they And when they see
[24:38] you yes listen it's not anything in you
[24:42] that they would admire but it's God
[24:45] letting them see something in you of
[24:49] him that will light the candle in their
[24:52] hearts and open up the eyes right of
[24:55] their hearts that they might see Christ
[24:58] amen not just see him but see him high
[25:01] and lifted up in the position that he's
[25:03] supposed to be in in his word today yes
[25:08] and the bride of
[25:10] Christ is the only one that can yes sir
[25:13] lead people to them amen we've got
[25:16] tapes but God doesn't deal with
[25:20] monuments he has living
[25:23] monuments living people Living Voices
[25:29] not perfect people but perfect in
[25:34] Christ and we're moving
[25:36] forward and I believe that our name our
[25:40] days here on this Earth is is very
[25:43] shortly coming to a
[25:45] climax and it's going to be the greatest
[25:47] victory since
[25:49] Calvary because death will be swallowed
[25:51] up in Victory death Was Defeated we're
[25:54] not waiting for it to be defeated it's
[25:57] The Last Enemy to be put under the feet
[25:59] of the Bride of Jesus Christ that's
[26:01] right brother and we're we're on the
[26:04] verge of that yes we are and it will
[26:06] take Faith to manifest that amen amen so
[26:10] let's stand if we will this evening and
[26:13] I'd like to read from uh
[26:15] Isaiah chapter
[26:17] 53 I had just a really difficult time uh
[26:22] this
[26:22] week and uh and today just trying to uh
[26:27] find find U I call it finding the
[26:31] channel and uh and I had so many
[26:35] different things on my mind told brother
[26:38] Chris I said brother Chris I said come
[26:41] on I just going to have to bring a salad
[26:44] and and then he said yeah word salad I
[26:46] said yeah that's right word salad and
[26:49] then he can bring the entree and kind of
[26:53] get everything put back together get all
[26:55] the lettuce back in the bowl and the Tom
[26:58] tomatoes and things and and he'll
[27:00] probably throw a little meat in there
[27:02] with it right so we're looking for God
[27:05] to
[27:08] really really move that's right God
[27:11] bless you Sister
[27:13] Peggy yeah you're not all alone that's
[27:16] right amen right you can't be alone
[27:20] because of the resurrected Christ amen
[27:23] and then the family that God has given
[27:26] you amen in Christ
[27:30] I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of
[27:34] God we we we have our we have our loved
[27:38] ones we have our loved ones but we can
[27:42] only go so far with
[27:44] them but when we're together with one
[27:46] another fellowshipping we can soar up
[27:49] into the
[27:50] heavens we can let our hair hang down
[27:53] and really reveal what's in our heart
[27:55] without worrying about a reproach that's
[27:58] good so we just want to be at Liberty
[28:01] this evening in Isaiah
[28:04] 53 verse
[28:07] one who hath believed our report and
[28:11] that word uh report actually translates
[28:16] message because if somebody gives you a
[28:19] report or giving you a message about
[28:21] something that's right so who has
[28:23] believed our report who has believed our
[28:26] message and to whom is the arm of the
[28:30] Lord revealed amen and that word arm
[28:34] actually means
[28:36] power it doesn't it's not talking about
[28:38] an appendage come on so these two it's
[28:43] not two different questions they're
[28:45] they're connected that's right because
[28:48] without qualifying on the first one you
[28:50] won't qualify on the second one they're
[28:53] built
[28:54] together who hath believed our report
[28:57] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[29:00] revealed let's bow our heads Heavenly
[29:03] Father we just thank you this evening
[29:05] for your mercies and Grace pray that
[29:09] you uh would be with uh the Wade family
[29:13] and all the all of the family through
[29:17] marriage and and it's a difficult time
[29:21] especially for sister Peggy may you just
[29:24] uplift her Lord with your strength and
[29:28] encourage her Lord in her spirit and
[29:31] Lord May the May the life of her soul
[29:35] overflow her spirit and body and bring
[29:38] it under subjection to the joy of the
[29:41] Lord not the joy of man and woman but
[29:43] the joy of the Lord that she has a
[29:46] husband that's waiting for her beyond
[29:49] the curtain of time that through the
[29:51] blood of Christ has made a way for an
[29:54] eternal Union to take place again and
[29:57] we're we're looking for that in our own
[29:59] lives for loved ones that's gone on
[30:01] before us and Lord it seems like the
[30:04] list is getting longer and longer it
[30:07] almost seems that in my generation
[30:10] there's more cross than there is that's
[30:12] waiting on this side but we're looking
[30:15] for the grand reunion when the dead
[30:18] shall rise in Christ and those that
[30:22] remain alive she will be joined with
[30:24] them changed in a moment and a twinkling
[30:27] of an eye
[30:29] and rise to meet our king of glory we're
[30:31] looking for that time so tonight Lord
[30:35] strengthen us speak to US Open the Eyes
[30:39] of our hearts Lord and shine a beam of
[30:43] light upon our path and may we walk in
[30:46] light as you are light for we ask it in
[30:49] Jesus Christ's name amen you may be
[30:54] seated so uh as I was saying it just
[30:58] uh a lot of uh thoughts and I I I
[31:02] determine that there's
[31:04] nothing I can preach tonight that hasn't
[31:07] already been preached like I said the
[31:10] the field has been plowed yeah and
[31:14] there's
[31:15] probably not anything I can say tonight
[31:18] that I haven't said before after 81
[31:21] years of life and uh started ministering
[31:25] 76 so then that's a a lot of a lot of
[31:29] Easter a lot of Christmases a lot of a
[31:32] lot of funerals a lot of weddings uh lot
[31:36] of dedications amen and you know you
[31:39] look back over your notes over the years
[31:41] and you're preaching exactly the same
[31:43] thing different titles but and sometimes
[31:46] the titles are the same yeah but I find
[31:49] that even though it's the same sermon
[31:52] the same words it's in a it's in a
[31:55] deeper cycle or a higher cycle
[31:58] because you look at your your Bibles and
[32:01] the message books you read when you was
[32:04] a year old two years old 5 years old in
[32:06] the message and you look at it now and
[32:09] the highlights are in different places
[32:12] you know I like looking back over my
[32:14] messages and just skimming through the
[32:16] highlights yeah but if you pick up a
[32:19] book that you haven't marked and you
[32:21] start reading it you'll find you be
[32:22] marking it in different places some of
[32:25] them are the same but but we're in a
[32:28] wherein Paul said when I was a child I
[32:31] spake as a
[32:32] child and he wasn't talking about
[32:35] foolishness he was talking about you and
[32:37] I in our natural lives and how that we
[32:41] have matured and so there's things you
[32:45] know that we used to think when we were
[32:47] young and we don't think that way
[32:49] anymore and life has become more serious
[32:52] uh
[32:53] responsibility has become more serious
[32:56] and so then uh we don't want to stay
[32:59] back in our childhood it's nice to look
[33:02] back in the pictures when you was little
[33:05] and and how good looking that you was
[33:07] and now how you kind of seemed like the
[33:09] mirrors kind of changed on you somehow
[33:12] you you know inside you're the same
[33:14] young person but outside your body's
[33:17] just not
[33:18] cooperating and uh but we don't want to
[33:22] go back and live all that over
[33:24] again and there was a lot of mistakes
[33:26] you wished you could go go back and redo
[33:29] some things but listen we we weren't
[33:32] built to go back in time like that right
[33:36] it's good to study history it's good to
[33:38] go back in the Old Testament all of the
[33:41] New Testament came out of the Old
[33:43] Testament Paul Peter John quoting those
[33:47] scriptures back there pulling out those
[33:49] Mysteries and bringing them up into a
[33:51] modern day setting absolutely bringing
[33:54] and and beaming light down Peter said
[33:57] said you know prophecy he said it's like
[34:00] a light in a dark place sir so in a in a
[34:04] room that's dark and you turn on the
[34:07] light and you say say we have a power
[34:09] failure and you say okay now I've got
[34:12] this this uh flash side up here and I
[34:14] hope the batter is working yeah now
[34:17] everybody I'm going to shine the light
[34:20] on the door because some of you are
[34:22] visitors and you don't know where it's
[34:24] at it's it's a total blackout so when I
[34:27] turn that light on you pay attention and
[34:29] take a look it's a beam of light that
[34:31] shows you the way you get on an airplane
[34:34] they say okay look down to your seats
[34:35] amen now if we have a power failure he
[34:38] said the lights will come on and show
[34:40] you the way that's right so Peter said
[34:43] am prophecy is like a light a beam yes
[34:48] sir shining in a dark place that's right
[34:51] it's Illuminating it may not illuminate
[34:53] the whole room but it's
[34:55] Illuminating what you're looking that
[34:58] and it opens up the eyes of your heart
[35:01] he said I pray the spirit of
[35:03] Illumination will illuminate your
[35:06] understanding illuminate your eyes you
[35:09] know the older you get it seems like
[35:10] it's either too much light or not enough
[35:12] light so they talk about the eye dimming
[35:16] and so it actually does that it's not
[35:17] gathering in the light like it used to
[35:19] and it's not seeing all the detail but
[35:22] in Christ there is an illumination of
[35:26] the eye of the heart that you can see
[35:29] clearly and so when prophecy is opened
[35:32] up it's like a beam of light shining
[35:35] down into a dark place Amen to give us
[35:38] understanding of what's taking place
[35:40] where to walk amen and we must be in the
[35:43] way we not can't be in the ditch we got
[35:46] to be in that way it's a Highway of
[35:50] Holiness and and that's where God wants
[35:53] us and it's amazing it just doesn't say
[35:57] walk in the light as he shines the light
[36:00] walk in the light as he is light I
[36:02] quoted it that way a lot of times but
[36:05] walk in the light as he is in the light
[36:08] so he is in the light showing you the
[36:11] way so it's very important to know him
[36:13] amen because you might walk with
[36:15] somebody else says they know the way and
[36:17] you might be walking with them and and
[36:19] you're off on the wrong trail somewhere
[36:21] like Pilgrim he always had to come back
[36:24] he never cut across the field to get
[36:26] back on the road
[36:28] he had to come back to the place where
[36:30] he left Christ where he left that road
[36:33] and then he continued on the journey
[36:35] always have to come back repent come
[36:38] back to where you left him and then and
[36:41] then go on like brother Brown said about
[36:43] that Soldier where did you leave him and
[36:46] he said he thought for a minute he said
[36:49] now I lay me down to sleep and I pray
[36:51] the Lord my soul to keep as a young man
[36:54] he had left him but listen he he was an
[36:57] old man now he was a matured man but he
[37:00] came right back to where he left him
[37:02] right there at Calvary not just a
[37:04] child's prayer but now an adult crying
[37:08] crying for repentance crying for
[37:10] forgiveness crying for the for the grace
[37:13] of God to come down because he was
[37:15] fixing a cross over and God gave him
[37:18] that opportunity to come back you know
[37:21] many people don't want to come back they
[37:23] don't want to admit uh defeat down this
[37:25] road that they've taken that's right but
[37:27] you have to admit I'm lost you have to
[37:30] admit defeat and you have to come back
[37:33] to that road and finish the journey on
[37:36] that road that God has set for
[37:38] us there's no other
[37:41] way right brother so in this scripture
[37:45] we find it says who has believed our
[37:49] report and to whom is the arm of the
[37:51] Lord revealed this is the scripture
[37:53] brother brandom used in God and
[37:56] simplicity and so he's actually warning
[37:58] the people especially all the
[38:01] theologians Y because when it's going to
[38:03] be over that they're going to
[38:05] say yeah what happened what I mean I
[38:07] already knew all that I thought this was
[38:10] really going to but they but they missed
[38:12] it amen you go back and study Revelation
[38:15] 5 yes sir and he says he said now he
[38:19] said uh God is this is the this is the
[38:22] breach it's the tie Block it's bringing
[38:25] the seals and the church ages here he
[38:28] said we're setting a scene we're setting
[38:30] a panoramic for what's fixing to take
[38:33] place when those seals are going to be
[38:34] open he said if you miss this he said
[38:37] you're going to miss the seals there's
[38:39] nothing in there about church agent I
[38:41] mean there's nothing in there about
[38:43] horse riders it's all on Redemption
[38:47] right and he and he's tying the church
[38:49] ages he said now the church ages is what
[38:52] took place that was the Antichrist but
[38:55] he said now the seals is is going to
[38:57] tell you about Redemption how he did it
[39:01] so it's not moving on to another time
[39:04] that that time is the opening of that
[39:06] information but it's actually going back
[39:08] and it's running in
[39:10] parallel the seals especially the first
[39:13] four seals are running in parallel it's
[39:16] it's coming together so then if if I
[39:19] don't understand you know a lot of times
[39:22] when we first come in we'd skip over the
[39:25] over the God and simplicity yeah I want
[39:27] to get to the seals what is this this is
[39:29] a breach yeah I I got to get past this
[39:32] thing but see they they missed the
[39:34] warning yes because he said something's
[39:37] fixing to happen and you ain't going to
[39:39] see it on because this God God is
[39:43] unrecognized and so that's what we're
[39:46] we're looking at this evening or trying
[39:48] to is that God is not always noticed
[39:52] when he comes on the
[39:55] scene I I thought about the woman at the
[39:57] well she comes up to Christ there's no
[40:01] anointing there's no Aurora lights or
[40:05] anything and hair don't stand up on the
[40:07] back of her neck it's just a man walking
[40:10] up to anybody that's here and I thought
[40:13] you know he was the Messiah the whole
[40:15] time he was God in human flesh the whole
[40:19] time and yet she didn't even she didn't
[40:21] know him the only thing she knew was
[40:24] yeah uh a Jew and here I am a Samaritan
[40:28] this is strange this guy's talking to me
[40:31] you know and and so then just in the in
[40:34] the conversation under the ministry of
[40:36] Christ absolutely don't ever let
[40:39] somebody tell you it doesn't make any
[40:40] difference what church you go
[40:42] to brother absolutely matters yeah
[40:47] because uh a church a minister can only
[40:52] preach from the rims of his experience
[40:56] abely Paul's letter
[40:57] they say was only the explanation of his
[41:01] experience and as his experience
[41:05] deepened his his letters deepened that's
[41:08] right right so he was preaching out of
[41:11] the rims of his experience now there was
[41:14] things he talked about he didn't
[41:16] experience like the
[41:17] Rapture but his gospel was an
[41:20] explanation of of his experience so then
[41:24] you know some people's experiences they
[41:27] may have had a true experience but
[41:29] they've misinterpreted it through
[41:31] emotions or some kind of Dynamics or
[41:33] something and it's not word-based
[41:36] uh I don't know who would have ever had
[41:39] a uh a more
[41:41] Dynamic um a visitation than Paul right
[41:46] yeah and I I thought the other day I
[41:48] always thought that was Jesus talking to
[41:50] Paul but it wasn't it was the Holy Ghost
[41:53] talking to him right because he said why
[41:56] pers Ute you me so who was the me it's
[42:00] the holy ghost in the people and here
[42:04] the Holy Spirit now had embodied himself
[42:06] in a pillar of fire and was speaking to
[42:09] Paul the holy spirit that was in the
[42:12] church is now in a pillar of fire and
[42:16] still in the church he ain't vacated
[42:18] nothing yet and yet he's talking to Paul
[42:21] on the
[42:21] road and Paul God had designed him a
[42:25] certain way listen he was a 180° out of
[42:29] sequence he was going the wrong way but
[42:32] what was motivating him was the seed
[42:35] that was down in him it was the love for
[42:38] God he committed his whole life as a
[42:40] young man went down there to Jerusalem
[42:42] from up there where he was at Tarsus his
[42:45] daddy sent him down there he went down
[42:47] there a young man and trained up under
[42:49] those and he was a Pharisee of Pharisees
[42:52] he excelled in Zeal in understanding and
[42:56] knowledge and why did he Excel because
[42:59] he was had such an IQ no because he
[43:02] loved God and he was trying to find that
[43:06] righteousness in order to please him and
[43:09] to serve him better and and he tried and
[43:13] he tried his whole life was driven uh
[43:16] just like David except he was he was he
[43:19] was under the wrong ministry right
[43:22] that's right and he was he was being
[43:24] pushed from that seed that was Within in
[43:28] but listen when he met him on the
[43:32] road there was no question
[43:35] then but then he went and he went back
[43:38] on the back side of the
[43:40] desert to make his calling an election
[43:44] sure amen and he wanted to know oh why
[43:47] did he come why did Messiah come why did
[43:50] he die why did he resurrect he wanted to
[43:54] know these things he wanted he wanted
[43:56] Christianity
[43:57] to have a reasonable gospel not a Dogma
[44:00] right and so on the back side of the
[44:03] desert uh the Holy Spirit Come and and
[44:07] opened up the Old Testament to Paul he
[44:09] said it was a new book to him listen he
[44:12] knew it from cover to cover he he could
[44:15] quote any any Scripture you could say a
[44:17] scripture he could finish it but now it
[44:20] was a new book what happened listen it's
[44:24] the same book yes it is it it wasn't it
[44:27] wasn't a new revised version but now he
[44:30] was looking at it with anointed eyes
[44:33] with a holy spirit that was taking him
[44:35] down just like Jesus Took the disciples
[44:39] right and he took he brought all the
[44:41] scriptures of the law of the prophets
[44:42] and the Psalms that spoke of him oh what
[44:46] a what a bible school that would have
[44:48] been what a Bible study that was and in
[44:51] such a short time to cover all that am
[44:54] listen he didn't mix in and mince a
[44:56] bunch of extra words and Flowery things
[44:59] he brought it right down laser sharp
[45:02] right to those scriptures and he took
[45:04] Paul on the back side of the desert and
[45:06] gave him the Saints of three and a half
[45:09] years right exactly right he he was only
[45:13] a few hours with the disciples right Y
[45:16] and he said I've already told you all
[45:18] this this is nothing new right but I'm
[45:21] telling you now because it's the
[45:23] anointed time there's things we preach
[45:26] we preach down Through the Ages but it
[45:28] was at a certain layer right yes amen
[45:31] but listen we're getting to the final
[45:33] layer and and there's things that you
[45:36] understand as adults that you didn't
[45:38] understand as a child as a teenager you
[45:41] understand these things now you might
[45:43] not be able to explain everything but
[45:45] there's a deeper understanding of what
[45:47] life is listen from where I stand like
[45:51] brother Walker said years ago he said
[45:53] from where I stand brother Michael he
[45:55] said I can see the Finish L and listen
[45:59] death is getting more real but you know
[46:01] what the fear that I had as a Young Man
[46:04] the fear is not there it's not something
[46:07] that you embrace it's not something that
[46:09] you want it's not something that you
[46:11] enjoy it's not a journey that you're
[46:13] looking forward to brother Bram said it
[46:16] wasn't made to be beautiful right it's
[46:19] only something like horses to take you
[46:22] into the presence of
[46:24] God because everything that God gives us
[46:28] everything that God gives you and me is
[46:31] by
[46:32] faith I thought about those I thought
[46:34] about those Jewish people that Israel
[46:36] standing there at the Red Sea and they
[46:39] looked out there and there was the enemy
[46:41] they was afraid of the enemy yes sir and
[46:43] they were coming to wipe him out and
[46:44] here come this Pillar of Fire amen and
[46:47] then that sea opened up I remember
[46:49] looking at that movie there Ten
[46:51] Commandments and that wall of water and
[46:53] all that noise and the wind blowing he
[46:55] said okay now just walk down through
[46:57] there there's your escape with every
[47:00] Temptation he makes a way of Escape he
[47:03] takes you right through that that's
[47:05] right and
[47:07] listen you look down through there they
[47:10] ain't never done that before and you
[47:12] walk in there looking at that water and
[47:14] all that it took Faith yes it did
[47:17] amen everything that God gives
[47:20] us it it takes Faith to accept it and to
[47:24] walk in
[47:25] thaten
[47:27] am so this it says who has
[47:31] believed our report and to whom is the
[47:34] arm of the Lord
[47:36] revealed so brother Brenham
[47:39] says he said they that believe the
[47:41] report I want to say not just believe
[47:44] the report but that the report is
[47:46] revealed to them right right you know
[47:50] Romans
[47:52] 5 says that we have access sir to Grace
[47:58] did you know that you had to have access
[48:00] to that you did it's out there for all
[48:02] the world but you know it's kind of like
[48:05] the resurrection there was many that saw
[48:06] the resurrection but there were a few
[48:09] benefactors right they saw it they
[48:11] witnessed it they could tell you all
[48:13] about it but they didn't draw any
[48:14] benefits from it
[48:17] no and so then he that the report has
[48:21] been revealed to and so Romans 5 if you
[48:25] go and read it it says we have access to
[48:29] this
[48:30] grace through faith that's
[48:34] right so Grace is sitting there but it
[48:37] takes Faith to benefit from that to have
[48:41] access to that and that's a gift to God
[48:44] it's not something that you did in Bible
[48:46] school so who has believed the message
[48:50] who has believed the report who has
[48:52] believed God's word amen and he that
[48:55] it's been revealed to yeah yes then the
[48:58] power of God has been
[49:00] revealed right amen you say well that's
[49:03] that's pretty simple it is but you know
[49:06] when when they came to Kadesh
[49:09] Barda they all heard the message didn't
[49:11] they yes amen right amen and I'm sure
[49:15] that they couldn't but help have to
[49:17] believe certain amounts of it sure yeah
[49:20] but when they got to kades Barda there
[49:23] was a problem yes sir only two
[49:28] people had
[49:30] recognized and had known the power of
[49:34] God
[49:35] right y right that's what we're looking
[49:38] at tonight we're I believe we're coming
[49:40] to another Crossroads yes sir yes sir
[49:43] we're coming to another dispensation
[49:45] change I believe that when we come to
[49:47] the Rapture the resurrection of the Dead
[49:50] I believe it's a dispensational change
[49:53] we came down through the church ages it
[49:56] was son of God y right come 63 the
[50:00] rejection of the ministry of the Son of
[50:02] God it was a crucifixion and a
[50:05] resurrection of the son of man believe
[50:07] that 1963 it was a changing dispensation
[50:11] that's right he said what he did on the
[50:13] day of Pentecost he was going to do
[50:15] again in the evening time so he said
[50:19] when they when the the third life
[50:21] messenger come the Holy Spirit and begin
[50:24] to pour out gifts they said this is it
[50:27] but listen they was only looking at the
[50:29] surface they really didn't know God no
[50:33] that's right uh you can know the acts of
[50:36] God but you don't know God's ways and
[50:40] there's a lot of difference that's right
[50:42] you know to know God Amen yes sir I was
[50:45] going to read that scripture uh over in
[50:47] St John 17 first three verses yes sir he
[50:51] said this is eternal
[50:53] life that you know the father right and
[50:57] whom he has sent that's right so then
[50:59] the nature or the characteristic of
[51:02] eternal life is to know that's
[51:05] right etern eternal life is just not
[51:08] loving your
[51:10] neighbor but the
[51:12] characteristic of eternal life he said
[51:15] this is eternal life you know you want
[51:17] to know if you have eternal life is to
[51:20] know the father and to know Jesus whom
[51:23] he has sent so if you know who he has
[51:27] sent
[51:28] today you know that's right that's
[51:31] eternal life to recognize who he has
[51:35] sent today Amen to believe the message
[51:38] to believe God's message the Lord shall
[51:40] Des send with a shout Revelation 101 a
[51:45] mighty Angel descended with a loud voice
[51:49] same scripture amen over here in in
[51:52] first uh Thessalonians over here in
[51:55] Revelation 10 amen yes and we see the
[51:57] same scene and he's got he's got a
[52:00] message yes he it's a shout he said it's
[52:03] a message to get the people together
[52:07] listen to believe the message is to have
[52:10] the power of God revealed to you I'm not
[52:13] talking about Pentecostal power that's a
[52:16] power power of Divine Healing that's not
[52:18] what I'm talking about I'm talking about
[52:22] recognizing the power of God today that
[52:26] was sent to Rapture a bride to prepare
[52:29] her
[52:30] heart and there's a message involved and
[52:33] there's a revealing of the presence of
[52:36] God the power of God at Katie's bardia
[52:39] they didn't have
[52:40] that they they came and and they they
[52:44] looked at the enemy they looked at the
[52:47] circumstances they knew the acts of God
[52:49] but they didn't know the way of God
[52:51] that's right but Joshua and
[52:54] Caleb the message was revealed to them
[52:57] not in the wilderness no come on down
[53:00] there in Goan amen when they were down
[53:02] there they caught a
[53:05] revelation and they followed that
[53:07] Revelation right and when they got to
[53:10] kades
[53:11] Barda the power of God had been revealed
[53:14] they said uh their defenses have gone uh
[53:18] their their weapons that's gone God has
[53:20] given us this land why because they had
[53:23] known God in an in inate
[53:27] way now God didn't talk to them lip to
[53:31] ear like he did Moses but you know what
[53:34] intimacy is intimacy he says I don't
[53:38] call you servant not anymore I call you
[53:41] friend that's that's going into a more
[53:44] intimate relationship from being a
[53:47] servant to being uh a friend he said
[53:51] because I haven't held back any
[53:53] information from you right so the
[53:55] intimate intimacy of God is is
[53:59] manifested through Revelation how much
[54:02] Revelation he reveals to you that's
[54:06] intimacy look at Enoch back there all
[54:09] those years he was looking for God the
[54:11] scripture says in Hebrews 11 Enoch was
[54:14] seeking God we're talking about looking
[54:16] for God many people seeking God they're
[54:19] seeking light uh some are seeking an
[54:21] education they're going to Bible college
[54:23] going to Seminary those things is all
[54:25] right but many times it takes you away
[54:28] from the original experience and The
[54:30] Thirst that you had to know him and then
[54:33] you're knowing more about him and half
[54:35] the information you're getting isn't
[54:37] coming from
[54:38] Heaven it's coming from a human
[54:41] knowledge and understanding through
[54:43] Theology and it's only taking you
[54:45] further away from
[54:47] God it's only muffling the voice of God
[54:50] Amen and you're hearing the voice of
[54:53] men but to know him is eternal life to
[54:58] to know to to have the message revealed
[55:01] and it opens up the eyes of your heart
[55:03] to his power
[55:05] [Music]
[55:06] amen the power that comes to the seed
[55:10] yes that quickens that seed amen amen
[55:13] and brings life to that seed that power
[55:16] that came on the day of
[55:18] Pentecost was life yes the power of this
[55:22] body is life yeah when the spirit leaves
[55:26] this
[55:27] body how much can it pick up can it bat
[55:30] an ey can it say can it communicate it
[55:33] can't do anything right same body same
[55:36] cells everything's the same but the
[55:39] spirit is left so the spirit is the life
[55:42] is the power of that body it permeates
[55:45] every cell it's something that's hard to
[55:49] wrap our minds around if you think about
[55:51] it in in depth y right but when it
[55:54] leaves then that spirit is the life is
[55:58] the strength the power of that body and
[56:02] what the spirit is to the body is what
[56:04] the holy spirit is to the
[56:07] soul exactly and when and when that
[56:11] Pillar of Fire came down on the day of
[56:14] Pentecost that was power it gave life to
[56:18] the soul and that Soul became a person
[56:22] it became a child of God up until that
[56:25] time it was a seed laying in the womb
[56:28] seed but listen that seed wasn't dormant
[56:31] no no no to be dormant means there's
[56:35] there's no intellect there's no nothing
[56:37] there but brother Brenham said you
[56:38] remember when you was out there in the
[56:40] world and he was a little different yeah
[56:43] there was an influence but it wasn't in
[56:46] control that little seed was divine in
[56:50] origin it was actually Divine in
[56:53] substance yes but it was not it was in
[56:57] itself it was eternal but it wasn't
[57:00] eternal life no but when the Holy Spirit
[57:03] came right brother amen then life came
[57:06] and you became you became eternal life
[57:10] amen and that began to war with the
[57:13] spirit oh yeah amen uh the old husband
[57:17] now has been put away and now you got a
[57:19] new headship right that's right amen and
[57:22] you begin to talk different y you begin
[57:24] to uh hang out with people in different
[57:27] places you'd never been
[57:29] before you you had fellowship with
[57:31] people that you wouldn't have uh wanted
[57:33] across the street and be identified with
[57:36] him now you was glad you were proud to
[57:39] be identified with him you used to kind
[57:41] of shun away from religious people you
[57:43] know maybe have a a good cultured
[57:46] religion a good cultured Church where
[57:48] when you went in the neighborhood oh I
[57:50] see you go to the first so and so church
[57:52] and then you know but but then to be a
[57:55] believer where do you go oh oh my
[57:58] goodness what's the name of that church
[58:00] again you know because it's an
[58:04] unrecognized name
[58:06] amen but to know him Amen in the power
[58:09] of his
[58:10] resurrection so in Psalms 103 and verse
[58:13] 6 it says it says that that God made his
[58:18] made his ways known to Moses and his
[58:21] acts to the children of
[58:24] Israel so the Noah's Act
[58:26] is to know the actions of God right to
[58:30] to see people healed see the dead raised
[58:33] see the discernments all those things
[58:36] see yes
[58:37] sir but to know his ways to know the
[58:40] motive that laid behind the action to
[58:44] know them in an intimacy listen we can
[58:46] read books about people know everything
[58:48] they do know their favorite color know
[58:50] their favorite food and like the little
[58:52] Canary while he's going to come in he's
[58:54] going to throw his hat over there he's
[58:55] going to sit over there in the chair
[58:57] he's going to get a cup of coffee he's
[58:58] going to take his shoes off his wife's
[59:00] going to bring in the slippers and he's
[59:01] going to put them on and the other
[59:03] little Canary sitting there and he's
[59:04] saying here he comes oh he threw his hat
[59:07] over there wow you smart and he went
[59:10] over there and got in a chair he's got a
[59:12] cup of coffee took his shoes off got his
[59:14] slippers on and so then the Master of
[59:16] the House walks up to the little Canary
[59:18] and says hey how you doing little Canary
[59:20] and he goes because he is a canary brain
[59:23] that's he don't understand human
[59:25] language
[59:26] right we can see we can understand but
[59:30] to know him Paul said that I might be
[59:33] found in the righteousness of God Amen
[59:36] you know the righteousness of God gives
[59:38] you access to something yes it does
[59:41] because he says that to have the
[59:43] righteousness of God not to be found in
[59:46] my righteousness but the righteousness
[59:48] which is of god originates with God not
[59:51] with man man has nothing to do and it's
[59:54] by faith and he said that I might know
[59:58] him yes so then righteousness gives you
[1:00:02] access Paul knew
[1:00:04] that look at his
[1:00:07] experience he he said that I might know
[1:00:10] him in the power of his resurrection and
[1:00:13] the fellowship of his
[1:00:16] suffering what is the power of his
[1:00:18] resurrection we're not talking about
[1:00:20] Pentecost right brother The Eyes Of Your
[1:00:23] Heart Right to know him
[1:00:26] amen believe his word because it's been
[1:00:29] revealed to you opens up your eyes to
[1:00:32] the arm of God to the power then when
[1:00:35] you come to kades Barda it it there's no
[1:00:38] fear you're not looking at the enemy
[1:00:41] you're looking at him his
[1:00:43] power look at the power that God has
[1:00:45] he's the only Power all other powers are
[1:00:48] delegated by himen he's the only one
[1:00:52] true life amen he not a form of life God
[1:00:56] is not a form of life we got human life
[1:00:59] that's a form of life but God was
[1:01:04] life praise the Lord right and God
[1:01:07] didn't send us a Founder he sent a
[1:01:09] prophet amen right a Founder is a is the
[1:01:12] embodiment of knowledge and he has
[1:01:17] disciples Christ Christ is the seed of
[1:01:20] Christianity he don't have disciples
[1:01:22] that's right come on he has Offspring
[1:01:25] yeah amen that's right because one seed
[1:01:28] brings fourth seed that's Offspring
[1:01:30] that's children that's right he didn't
[1:01:33] send us a book of knowledge he didn't
[1:01:35] send us a man that could tell us all
[1:01:37] these things and yet he did but he came
[1:01:40] to introduce us to
[1:01:43] Christ he he came El easier to call a
[1:01:46] bride there's been a bride in every age
[1:01:50] but this is the final age this is the
[1:01:52] Capstone age the Capstone of the of the
[1:01:56] elect of God coming into a bride you
[1:01:58] talk about intimacy this is the most
[1:02:01] intimate age all that was in the mind of
[1:02:05] God is now in the heart of the believer
[1:02:07] that's that's
[1:02:08] intimacy you know when you're intimate
[1:02:11] you try to find uh information about
[1:02:13] somebody you go to the wife because if
[1:02:16] the wife knows nobody knows the husband
[1:02:18] like the wife
[1:02:20] does that's the that's the ultimate uh
[1:02:23] intimacy the children they know a lot
[1:02:25] but they've never had that relationship
[1:02:27] they don't have that
[1:02:29] claim uh they're not in that
[1:02:31] dispensation and yet they can tell you a
[1:02:33] lot yeah sure uh my children can tell
[1:02:36] you what I like what I don't like but
[1:02:39] now to share my my thoughts with my wife
[1:02:43] you know think now honey he told me not
[1:02:45] to tell anybody but I'm telling you
[1:02:47] because I know you won't tell nobody and
[1:02:49] you and me we won you
[1:02:52] know and he tells his bride he opened up
[1:02:56] those seals he did every mystery that's
[1:03:00] allotted for us there might be Mysteries
[1:03:02] yet to come in the Millennium that's not
[1:03:05] important right now what we need is the
[1:03:09] is the
[1:03:13] Mysteries look at Deuteronomy 29 a
[1:03:19] moment Deuteronomy
[1:03:22] 29 and verse two come on
[1:03:27] yes Deuteronomy
[1:03:30] 29 verse
[1:03:33] 2 praise the Lord and Moses called onto
[1:03:37] all Israel and said unto them ye have
[1:03:41] seen all that the Lord did before your
[1:03:45] eyes in the land of Egypt onto Pharaoh
[1:03:49] and unto all his servants yes and unto
[1:03:53] all his land now we're talking about the
[1:03:56] acts of God
[1:03:58] now we're talk talking about the way of
[1:04:01] God
[1:04:02] right you can be in church a long time
[1:04:05] and see
[1:04:06] Miracles see a lot of
[1:04:09] things he said you've seen these
[1:04:12] things but you know seeing those things
[1:04:15] eating that
[1:04:16] Mana you know that that was a that was a
[1:04:19] great experience eating food that God
[1:04:22] had created not something that was made
[1:04:24] down here and put together on the Earth
[1:04:26] by the miraculous but he created it in
[1:04:29] heaven right and then sent it down and
[1:04:33] they ate it everything that they needed
[1:04:37] uh for nutritional value for the body to
[1:04:39] be healthy the immune system and
[1:04:41] everything was in that was in that bread
[1:04:45] everything amen and Corruption was in
[1:04:48] that bread yes it was when he designed
[1:04:51] it he designed it to where it would
[1:04:54] corrupt you tell me any bakery that
[1:04:57] makes bread and Designs it to mold not
[1:05:00] unless they're trying to get you to
[1:05:02] spend a bunch of money but mostly
[1:05:04] they're trying to put preservatives in
[1:05:07] there but he did
[1:05:09] it here was bread that came down from
[1:05:12] heaven and everything that you needed
[1:05:15] for nutritional value was in there yes
[1:05:18] you didn't need any other supplements no
[1:05:21] no other pills water sure you needed
[1:05:24] water sunlight and other those other
[1:05:26] elements but as far as food that's all
[1:05:29] you
[1:05:32] needed that's what that's what you
[1:05:34] needed was that Mana but in there he
[1:05:38] also designed it to where it would that
[1:05:42] it would uh it would spoil right get
[1:05:47] worms and go bad now remember it's
[1:05:51] divine in origin you would think that
[1:05:53] anything that is divine in origin Orin
[1:05:56] would be
[1:05:57] Eternal the body of Jesus Christ was
[1:05:59] divine in origin it was spoken to
[1:06:03] existence and yet death was in
[1:06:05] it wrinkles was in
[1:06:08] it and yet it was divine in origin but
[1:06:11] itself wasn't Divine Right amen and the
[1:06:14] bread the Mana it wasn't
[1:06:17] Divine and he designed it that way for a
[1:06:20] purpose amen yes sir he designed the
[1:06:22] body of Christ that way that where he
[1:06:24] could be a sacrifice
[1:06:26] amen somebody that's Eternal and can't
[1:06:29] die right that don't ever get any oil
[1:06:32] you know death can't touch
[1:06:34] him he couldn't be a sacrifice he had to
[1:06:37] feel pain God couldn't feel
[1:06:41] pain God really don't have a lot of
[1:06:43] emotions he only speaks through the
[1:06:46] emotions of humans so that you could
[1:06:48] understand him amen he said it repented
[1:06:51] God God repented for something he did
[1:06:54] and he never makes mistakes
[1:06:56] then how could he repent and never make
[1:06:57] a mistake but he he expressed it that
[1:07:00] way to where you could understand right
[1:07:04] but when he came down in Christ he had
[1:07:06] emotions he cried he had pain he had
[1:07:10] friends yes he he had enemies but he
[1:07:13] didn't have
[1:07:14] hatred so it said that he he experienced
[1:07:18] all those things where he could be a
[1:07:19] high priest a mediator for you and I God
[1:07:23] couldn't he could he could be a mediator
[1:07:25] but not a true mediator he couldn't
[1:07:27] sympathize with us he never felt that he
[1:07:30] never experienced it but he did in
[1:07:32] Christ amen yes sir yeah amen and he
[1:07:35] designed he designed that body to where
[1:07:38] it would die that he could give his life
[1:07:41] amen but you know he really when he came
[1:07:44] into the world because he was spoken to
[1:07:46] his existence he didn't have a sinful
[1:07:50] body because he didn't come through sex
[1:07:53] so he really didn't have the death
[1:07:55] penalty on
[1:07:57] him if he had wanted to step right on up
[1:08:01] death didn't have a hold on him but he
[1:08:03] became sin not sinful became sin amen
[1:08:09] that Mana was designed that
[1:08:11] way and it came to a time that Jesus had
[1:08:14] to tell the people said listen Moses
[1:08:17] didn't give you that
[1:08:19] information Moses didn't give you that
[1:08:22] Mana God gave you the Mana now somehow
[1:08:24] they had twisted this thing around where
[1:08:27] it came from Moses because they they
[1:08:29] looked to Moses but they they they
[1:08:32] elevated
[1:08:33] Moses above
[1:08:36] measure come on but
[1:08:39] listen that Mana wouldn't do you any
[1:08:42] good without the instructions from Moses
[1:08:45] right amen come on God gave him the
[1:08:48] instructions to where you could draw
[1:08:51] benefits from the
[1:08:53] Mana he told you when you could get it
[1:08:55] when you couldn't get it he told you how
[1:08:58] much to get how much not to get he told
[1:09:00] you when to save it and when not to save
[1:09:02] it and sometimes people get frustrated
[1:09:05] they want a book of rules now wait a
[1:09:07] minute you said get enough for every day
[1:09:09] now you're telling us to get enough for
[1:09:11] today and tomorrow you done change the
[1:09:13] rules he said I'm just telling you what
[1:09:15] God Said
[1:09:17] right and the Mana came that it might
[1:09:20] humble them in other words bring them
[1:09:22] under obedience to God right right
[1:09:25] and to teach them that man shall live by
[1:09:28] every word that proceedeth from the
[1:09:30] mouth of God because if they didn't pay
[1:09:32] their mind to Moses and they say well he
[1:09:35] ain't nothing God gave us this he's just
[1:09:37] a bystander but listen he had the
[1:09:41] instructions and without the
[1:09:43] instructions you couldn't properly
[1:09:45] depend upon that Mana because you didn't
[1:09:47] know how it was going to treat you it
[1:09:50] didn't know if it was going to be there
[1:09:51] or not there and he laid it out and told
[1:09:54] you because it came from God so Moses
[1:09:57] had a place into that yeah brother
[1:10:00] brandom has a place listen the
[1:10:02] Revelation didn't come from brother
[1:10:03] brandom he was a conduit it came through
[1:10:08] him it came through him to you and me
[1:10:11] amen but listen he had a part in it he
[1:10:14] had to bring it to us amen right yes sir
[1:10:19] God can speak the language of Chinese or
[1:10:21] a Kian he can right God has doesn't have
[1:10:25] any barriers no sir not a
[1:10:28] one but like they rejected Moses they
[1:10:31] rejected brother brandham right exactly
[1:10:34] because it didn't come their way it
[1:10:35] wasn't the way they planned
[1:10:37] it so look so in Deuteronomy 29 here it
[1:10:42] says they saw all these things they saw
[1:10:45] the acts of God keep that in
[1:10:48] mind because Hebrews over in Hebrews
[1:10:51] 3 it said that the fathers in the
[1:10:55] Wilderness they always ER and that word
[1:10:59] error means to go astray right they AED
[1:11:02] in their hearts how did they er not
[1:11:05] knowing my ways they didn't know the
[1:11:08] ways of God and it caused them to erir
[1:11:11] or to go astray yesen they left the
[1:11:15] message they left the messenger yes they
[1:11:18] aired in their hearts an evil
[1:11:21] heart because they didn't know his ways
[1:11:24] so they knew a lot about him they had
[1:11:25] had a lot of experience oh yeah listen
[1:11:28] people have a lot of
[1:11:30] experiences and then they think well we
[1:11:32] don't need this one and we don't need
[1:11:34] that one I'm good at I'm Island on to my
[1:11:36] own or my four and no more little
[1:11:38] Minister groups and things yes listen
[1:11:41] it's the body of
[1:11:43] Christ it's it's just not special
[1:11:46] fellowships it's not just feeding off of
[1:11:49] one another we're supposed to feed off
[1:11:50] of Christ we're supposed to feed off of
[1:11:53] the anointed word the the holy spirit is
[1:11:56] the feeder of the word he uses human
[1:11:59] vessels that's right you know who the
[1:12:01] first missionaries were come on the
[1:12:04] church it wasn't the
[1:12:07] apostles acts the 8th chapter and the
[1:12:09] church was scattered abroad and they
[1:12:12] went everywhere preaching the word and
[1:12:15] churches grew up here and there because
[1:12:18] the SK the seed had been scattered and
[1:12:21] they didn't bring forth church members
[1:12:23] they brought forth off Spring
[1:12:26] right
[1:12:28] yes so then if he writes a book of Acts
[1:12:32] again listen it ain't going to be
[1:12:34] everybody that's out here ministers
[1:12:37] missionarying it's going to be the body
[1:12:39] of Christ because the seed has come to
[1:12:42] maturity when that seed comes to
[1:12:44] maturity amen the the life comes up up
[1:12:47] through the stalk the life is embodied
[1:12:50] in that stock yep but it don't have a
[1:12:52] life of its own no I cut that stock off
[1:12:55] and stick it out there and plant it
[1:12:56] what's it going to do
[1:12:58] die but when but when that life comes up
[1:13:02] through there we was looking at some
[1:13:05] corn coming up here fields of corn and
[1:13:09] it was all green at the top and the ears
[1:13:11] were up there looked like it was getting
[1:13:13] pretty close to being harvested I got to
[1:13:16] notice and down there at the bottom it
[1:13:18] was turning brown I said There It Is
[1:13:22] that seed is calling for the life
[1:13:25] because when that seed when that life
[1:13:27] gets up into that seed and it gets
[1:13:29] matured y you know what happens come the
[1:13:32] B the body spits it out because it has a
[1:13:35] life of its own amen that's why this
[1:13:38] assembly is still here that's why you're
[1:13:40] still here because in you is a seed you
[1:13:43] have a life of your own but it's part of
[1:13:45] a body it's part of
[1:13:47] God but listen that seed can bring forth
[1:13:51] you know we as as men and women you know
[1:13:54] some people don't believe that anymore
[1:13:56] but I still believe in men and women you
[1:13:59] know yes I hate I hate to think what
[1:14:03] movies are going to be like in the
[1:14:05] future
[1:14:07] somewhere Lord I don't know what a mess
[1:14:11] come on brother not that I like movies
[1:14:13] but you know what I'm saying we're so
[1:14:16] used to the hero and the heroine and you
[1:14:19] know the White Horse and the white white
[1:14:21] uniform and the white hat you know and
[1:14:24] and the little Affair and all those
[1:14:26] things now I don't know what you're
[1:14:28] going to have you're going to have a
[1:14:30] mess yeah they won't even after a while
[1:14:33] they won't know the difference between
[1:14:34] the horse and a human yeah right because
[1:14:37] their mind is rottening it it's
[1:14:40] deteriorating I believe that I'm just
[1:14:43] glad we're still in our right
[1:14:46] Minds that's right so look what he says
[1:14:49] here the great the great
[1:14:51] Temptation which thine eyes have seen
[1:14:54] and that means tests trials eyes have
[1:14:57] seen the signs those great Miracles yet
[1:15:02] the Lord has not given
[1:15:04] you see now the Lord has not given you a
[1:15:09] heart to perceive or to
[1:15:11] understand in other words the eyes of
[1:15:15] their heart right is
[1:15:18] veiled no light in there they can't
[1:15:21] perceive
[1:15:23] right I eyes to see and ears to hear
[1:15:27] unto this day I have led you 40 years in
[1:15:31] the
[1:15:32] wilderness your clothes are not wax and
[1:15:35] old upon you thy shoes are not wax and
[1:15:38] old upon thy foot every one of them it
[1:15:42] wasn't just the Believers
[1:15:44] now everybody's lumped in here
[1:15:47] together they've all had the same
[1:15:50] experiences Dayan and Cory they could
[1:15:53] look at their shoes right they look at
[1:15:55] their
[1:15:56] clothes they ate the
[1:15:59] Mana they they drank the water from the
[1:16:01] rock they sent under Moses's ministry
[1:16:05] right even though they couldn't stand it
[1:16:07] they were like the 70 they said we can't
[1:16:09] stand this we can't I don't want to
[1:16:10] listen to this no more we're out of
[1:16:12] here amen and yet they were a witness to
[1:16:16] it just think about it people don't like
[1:16:19] your preaching don't like my preaching
[1:16:20] don't like yours you other ministers in
[1:16:23] here they don't like your preaching
[1:16:25] listen 70 out of uh 82 of the church
[1:16:30] members didn't like the pastors
[1:16:32] preaching that's
[1:16:34] right that's that's pretty good percent
[1:16:36] that's right they got up and walked out
[1:16:39] you read it in the Amplified they didn't
[1:16:41] want to hear that no more they tired of
[1:16:42] hearing that all this mess about eating
[1:16:46] bread and eating my flesh and this and
[1:16:48] that we ain't going no we ain't going
[1:16:51] that
[1:16:52] route and then right in the middle of
[1:16:54] that would you like to belong to a
[1:16:56] church now say this is the
[1:16:58] church brother Dale comes up here
[1:17:01] brother Wade your first name should have
[1:17:04] been brother Dale I can't I can't ever
[1:17:06] you know it it just yeah well I know to
[1:17:10] that one yeah well what can I say but
[1:17:14] when I say brother Dale I think that's
[1:17:16] your first name and it ain't then I have
[1:17:18] to say brother Wade brother Wade Dale
[1:17:20] sounds
[1:17:21] right but uh
[1:17:25] this
[1:17:27] world 20 years ago I could have
[1:17:30] never
[1:17:32] imagined that America would be in the
[1:17:35] condition that it's
[1:17:37] in right
[1:17:48] yes in verse six you have not eaten
[1:17:52] bread neither have you drunk drunk wine
[1:17:55] or strong drink that you might
[1:17:58] know that I am the Lord your God now
[1:18:01] there there's the ways yes and here's
[1:18:04] the acts they knew all the acts of God
[1:18:07] they had participated in all the
[1:18:10] meetings but when it came to kades
[1:18:13] Barda the power of God had not been
[1:18:15] revealed to them they didn't know the
[1:18:17] way of
[1:18:19] God because God had not opened up their
[1:18:22] hearts to perceive amen the woman at the
[1:18:26] well she says I perceive now where did
[1:18:31] that come
[1:18:32] from it sure didn't come from Sunday
[1:18:35] school now some of the information came
[1:18:37] from Sunday school she realized by the
[1:18:40] teaching of the Pharisees what Messiah
[1:18:43] was to do what a prophet did she done
[1:18:45] heard enough about Isaiah and Moses and
[1:18:48] all the teaching she went to Sunday
[1:18:50] school she went to church with her mom
[1:18:51] and dad but she was looking for
[1:18:54] something
[1:18:56] yeah yes sir Luther was looking for
[1:18:58] something yes sir Paul was looking for
[1:19:02] something and they searched with Agony
[1:19:06] yes you searched you say well I really
[1:19:09] didn't search yes you did that you down
[1:19:12] in the side of
[1:19:14] you it was
[1:19:16] searching the Deep cth to the Deep Paul
[1:19:19] said this seed y you take that seed that
[1:19:24] you buy in the store and I don't know
[1:19:26] how old it is you can put it up in the
[1:19:28] pantry and keep it a a year or two and
[1:19:31] take it and that
[1:19:33] seed I've always said it's it's crying
[1:19:36] for water it's crying for sun yeah and
[1:19:40] and you say well I don't think so I
[1:19:42] didn't hear it you said I wasn't looking
[1:19:45] for God that woman at the well wasn't
[1:19:46] looking for God that's what her problem
[1:19:48] was she was looking for him but she
[1:19:50] didn't know where to find
[1:19:52] him job said if I could behind him yeah
[1:19:55] that's right amen he said if I knew
[1:19:57] where his seat was if I knew where his
[1:19:58] throne was every seed of God is crying
[1:20:02] out to
[1:20:04] God it's looking it's looking for that
[1:20:07] place to come to where the light can
[1:20:09] strike it amen that it can be what it's
[1:20:12] supposed to be amen you take that seed
[1:20:15] you say well it's not doing that you put
[1:20:17] it down the ground and you put some
[1:20:19] water in it and see what happens God
[1:20:23] predestinated you
[1:20:25] by his for
[1:20:26] knowledge now his for knowledge didn't
[1:20:29] look down through the tunnel of time and
[1:20:32] and seeing brother Dale come to church
[1:20:33] and backslid and went out and came back
[1:20:36] and said oh I'm going to predestinate
[1:20:37] him to be a preacher no that's based on
[1:20:42] merits right and Grace is not based on
[1:20:46] Merit it has nothing to do with what you
[1:20:49] are it's who you are down on the
[1:20:52] inside Grace tells you you why you got
[1:20:56] saved Faith tells you how you got saved
[1:20:59] but God knew he'd have so many
[1:21:03] children he knew exactly how many
[1:21:05] children he knew what body they'd be
[1:21:07] born in so he predestinated an event in
[1:21:11] your life yes sir he didn't predestinate
[1:21:14] you the seed was already there that's
[1:21:16] right but he predestinated an event it
[1:21:20] that the sunlight and the water amen the
[1:21:23] water of the Holy ho Spirit the water of
[1:21:25] God that's right that fountain that
[1:21:27] floweth from
[1:21:29] within it it came and watered the seed
[1:21:33] somebody testified you read your Bible
[1:21:35] you read a book you listened to a
[1:21:37] message I don't care how it come God
[1:21:40] orchestrated that's right an event he
[1:21:42] made sure he did that you was going to
[1:21:45] get your inheritance we're coming to
[1:21:48] adoption they were coming to adoption
[1:21:51] but they didn't know him no no they
[1:21:54] didn't they didn't believe the message
[1:21:56] they they intellectually that's right
[1:21:59] but look when they came to kades Barda
[1:22:02] Hope and
[1:22:04] Faith Hope and Faith were coming to a
[1:22:07] Crossroads Hope and Faith agreed you
[1:22:10] believe the message yes I believe the
[1:22:12] message Hope believes the word right
[1:22:15] hope believes in God hope hopes for it
[1:22:19] faith has it faith is the substance of
[1:22:22] things hoped for right but some never
[1:22:25] knew him right and so they never got
[1:22:28] past hope so they came up to kades
[1:22:30] bardia
[1:22:32] Crossroads and they said they said we
[1:22:34] believe the promise and they had
[1:22:36] Fellowship they had communion right up
[1:22:39] until they came to kades Barda but now
[1:22:42] something happened information came that
[1:22:46] discouraged hope it said that Abraham
[1:22:49] hoped against hope in other words there
[1:22:53] was no qualification for hope it was
[1:22:56] contrary to Hope but now his Hope was
[1:22:59] beginning to turn into Faith amen and so
[1:23:03] now hope began to sound like Faith yeah
[1:23:06] oh yeah until that he said he considered
[1:23:09] not the weakness of his body being not
[1:23:11] weak in faith that's right and faith is
[1:23:14] the substance of things hoped for amen
[1:23:16] right remember we preached on
[1:23:18] Sarah and he came he came to the tent he
[1:23:22] says well this time next year
[1:23:25] and Sarah laughed watch didn't she laugh
[1:23:28] yeah but tell me she had Faith you read
[1:23:31] Hebrews 11 it
[1:23:34] said by faith also by faith she
[1:23:37] conceived a seed that's
[1:23:40] right she didn't have any
[1:23:42] faith but then she met him she met the
[1:23:47] one that made the
[1:23:48] promise he looked at her and he
[1:23:51] said he saides you did and right then
[1:23:55] she knew who he was
[1:23:58] absolutely she believed him yes but now
[1:24:01] hope had come to Faith yeah and she
[1:24:04] believed the same her testimony was the
[1:24:06] same as as Abraham's he considered not
[1:24:09] the weakness of his body nor the
[1:24:10] deadness of her womb and she considered
[1:24:13] not the deadness of her womb nor the
[1:24:15] deadness of his body amen their their
[1:24:18] faith because they had met the guarante
[1:24:20] listen Joshua and Caleb they had met the
[1:24:23] guarante oh yeah amen they had met the
[1:24:26] one that came down amen they may not
[1:24:28] have met him like like Moses met him but
[1:24:31] they knew him yes they not only knew his
[1:24:34] acts they knew his
[1:24:36] ways they believed the report it was
[1:24:38] revealed to them down there in Goan amen
[1:24:42] and because they revealed the power of
[1:24:44] God he says right there he said I did
[1:24:47] these things why did he do those things
[1:24:50] he was trying to reveal himself to the
[1:24:53] people he said that you might know that
[1:24:55] I am the Lord your God but they didn't
[1:24:58] know no they they didn't they were
[1:25:00] non-elect no right they could come up to
[1:25:03] kades Bard and fellowship listen people
[1:25:06] can Fellowship in this message and they
[1:25:07] come up to a certain place and then they
[1:25:10] just peel
[1:25:11] off yes sir they never they never met
[1:25:15] him no they didn't right brother that's
[1:25:17] right the woman at the well met him
[1:25:21] yeah job met him glory
[1:25:25] Enoch met him look what happened to
[1:25:27] Enoch amen there he was in the church he
[1:25:29] was a Believer listen to the testimony
[1:25:32] of of Adam Adam said oh we walked with
[1:25:35] him in the cool of the evening I told
[1:25:37] you this before that's what I believe
[1:25:40] and he said I believe he's the same
[1:25:42] yesterday today and forever you know he
[1:25:45] says I believe it's in Satan's Eden he
[1:25:47] said eve fell at One Promise she fell at
[1:25:51] One Promise Hebrews 138 yeah he's the
[1:25:55] same yesterday today and forever thought
[1:25:57] he' changed his mind about his
[1:25:59] word but Enoch said he's the same amen
[1:26:04] if if he walked I I thought coming up
[1:26:06] here I thought I wonder how many times
[1:26:08] he went to that Eastern Gate because
[1:26:11] they must have known uh Cain and Abel
[1:26:14] they knew that that was the place they
[1:26:16] came out and they knew that's where to
[1:26:17] bring their altars that's knew where
[1:26:19] they so he must have gone there and he
[1:26:21] must have looked saw those Flames he
[1:26:23] said man maybe he's behind there I don't
[1:26:26] know I just and and the scripture says
[1:26:29] in Hebrews 11 that they that seeketh God
[1:26:32] diligently seek him so it's talking
[1:26:35] about Enoch and remember Enoch is you
[1:26:38] Amen in this day you were seeking God
[1:26:42] you were seeking the reality of God
[1:26:45] Sarah was seeking seeking truth and here
[1:26:49] came the sign of the son of man the sign
[1:26:51] of the word and here come the sign of
[1:26:54] the word and you believe the message and
[1:26:56] you saw the power of God not brother
[1:26:58] brandom the power of God that's right in
[1:27:01] his word the word of his power that
[1:27:04] sustains
[1:27:06] everything the authority of the word the
[1:27:10] power of authority is the power of the
[1:27:12] word amen yes right amen we're coming to
[1:27:15] adoption you know why he redeemed you so
[1:27:18] you could be a Christian no that's
[1:27:20] that's true but it says he in in the
[1:27:24] fullness of time he sent his son to
[1:27:28] redeem you that you might receive the
[1:27:33] adoption of sons amen you know what that
[1:27:35] means come on receive not just become

[1:28:08] brother and we're coming yes I'm I'm
[1:28:13] going to tell
[1:28:14] you I've taken already enough
[1:28:18] time good but you look at this do you
[1:28:21] know Revelation 13
[1:28:25] the mark of the
[1:28:26] beast do you
[1:28:28] know that that's a theocracy yeah that's
[1:28:33] a a
[1:28:34] theocracy is is when that you have a
[1:28:37] government that claims to be divinely
[1:28:40] led
[1:28:42] yes uh Israel was a theocracy in the Old
[1:28:45] Testament they had the
[1:28:47] king and they had the prophet right yep
[1:28:51] and God guided the king and the people
[1:28:53] through the prophet
[1:28:54] right and the prophet was the was the
[1:28:57] ruler right right so what what is
[1:29:01] revelation
[1:29:02] 133 it's a it's a theocracy that's what
[1:29:05] Nimrod was he built a tower and a city
[1:29:10] the tower is
[1:29:11] religion the city is civil power yes so
[1:29:15] it was a union between what they call a
[1:29:17] union between church and state it was a
[1:29:19] union brother BR said those two horns
[1:29:22] was ecclesiastical power and civil power
[1:29:29] right look at Trump in 2016 I could read
[1:29:34] some things that he said that he was
[1:29:36] going to do for Christianity he did a
[1:29:37] lot of
[1:29:39] things he's
[1:29:40] unconverted right right you know now he
[1:29:44] he says
[1:29:45] America needs to needs to pray
[1:29:49] together and let me see if I can find
[1:29:52] this real quick
[1:29:57] oh my if I can't find it real quick I'm
[1:30:01] just going to leave it alone leave
[1:30:03] something on the plate yeah well you
[1:30:06] said you said a salad I'm trying to get
[1:30:09] everything out
[1:30:11] here this is
[1:30:14] 2016
[1:30:16] Trump now when when I say Trump I want
[1:30:19] you to think about
[1:30:21] Constantine yes exactly
[1:30:25] what did Constantine do 325 years of
[1:30:29] church persecution Y and then he
[1:30:32] championed the cause of Christianity do
[1:30:34] you know what he looked like in the eyes
[1:30:36] of those Christians that have been
[1:30:37] persecuted hunted and killed and burned
[1:30:40] and just all had been done for 325 years
[1:30:43] and he says no more persecution of the
[1:30:47] Jews said wow can you believe that when
[1:30:51] he said that no more pers then they
[1:30:54] recognized Christianity as a national
[1:30:57] religion right he he was a pagan he put
[1:31:00] away the Pagan shrines and the idols and
[1:31:03] he made all the pagans come to catechism
[1:31:06] and they all had to learn about water
[1:31:08] baptism and they were exed to be
[1:31:10] baptized if they
[1:31:12] didn't capital punishment right right
[1:31:16] and he championed the cause of
[1:31:18] Christianity and he brought forth a
[1:31:20] marriage and he married paganism that's
[1:31:23] right and Christianity did and Pagan
[1:31:26] Rome became Pap Rome a theocracy
[1:31:31] right and then Rome ruled Europe for
[1:31:35] 12200 years yes sir under a theocracy
[1:31:38] yes all of Europe and then when the
[1:31:41] Reformation came the reformers they took
[1:31:44] the same
[1:31:46] path Germany became Lutheran that's
[1:31:49] right and you had to get your children
[1:31:51] sprinkled and they became Lutheran
[1:31:53] Church yes sir if you didn't bad news
[1:31:57] yeah and they followed in the thing all
[1:32:00] of
[1:32:01] Europe that's
[1:32:03] right and Trump
[1:32:05] says he's going to change the law back
[1:32:08] so that Christian companies will not
[1:32:10] have to supply insurance for abortions
[1:32:13] he's going to put Merry Christmas back
[1:32:15] in the department store putting Christ
[1:32:18] back into Christmas he was also slamming
[1:32:21] people who didn't say Merry Christmas
[1:32:23] you
[1:32:25] know Tony Perkins the president of
[1:32:28] Family Resources said Trump is committed
[1:32:30] to undoing the anti-faith policies of
[1:32:34] the previous administration restoring

[1:32:38] freedom Trump said that we are stopping
[1:32:42] cold the attacks on Judo Christian

[1:32:51] Believers and together we we are
[1:32:54] strengthened by the power of
[1:32:56] prayer W he he as the President of the

[1:35:51] out of it he didn't know what to do
[1:35:53] right
[1:35:54] the foolish virgin has enough about her
[1:35:57] to

[1:36:09] time you tell me how close we are I
[1:36:12] don't know whether this man's going to
[1:36:13] get in everything is so chaotic but it
[1:36:17] shows you how easy it is and how it's
[1:36:21] coming it'll look like taking up to
[1:36:23] cause of Christianity playing right into
[1:36:26] the hands of Satan Satan wants to be
[1:36:28] your
[1:36:29] Champion he'll come into the church
[1:36:32] he'll butter you up he'll he'll prolite
[1:36:36] you he'll do everything he can right
[1:36:38] except give you the word he don't want
[1:36:39] you to be
[1:36:44] liberated any
[1:36:46] man like
[1:36:48] David David was King had a house of
[1:36:52] Cedars yeah but he wanted he wanted the
[1:36:55] arc the presence of God yeah in the
[1:36:58] midst of the people yeah any
[1:37:01] Minister wants the Living God the living
[1:37:05] Christ the Holy Spirit yes sir in the
[1:37:08] center of the church amen that light
[1:37:14] amen I believe this church has that
[1:37:17] light amen praise God it's no time to
[1:37:21] buckle it's no time to fall
[1:37:24] no right
[1:37:25] brother and he can still be found yes
[1:37:29] yes
[1:37:30] sir sometimes we just need to go buy
[1:37:32] that artisian well and just get a nice
[1:37:35] fresh
[1:37:37] drink my wife come in here she say you
[1:37:40] want some water I said I don't need any
[1:37:41] water right now she said I got to have
[1:37:43] some water I got to so we went down in
[1:37:46] the kitchen and there's there that
[1:37:47] little bubble thing there you know it's
[1:37:50] got the three switches on the top you
[1:37:52] can tell the visitors
[1:37:59] yeah she says oh it's cold and
[1:38:04] refreshing but I want to tell you what
[1:38:07] it's nothing like getting a drink out of
[1:38:09] an Arian well if you've ever drank out
[1:38:11] of an artisian well or a bubbling brook
[1:38:14] coming down the mountain side it's it's
[1:38:17] pretty close y but it ain't the real
[1:38:19] thing no it ain't right and he said that
[1:38:22] he would put a fountain yes inside of
[1:38:24] each and every one of us that's right
[1:38:26] that somebody could get a cold drink
[1:38:28] sometimes they need a cold drink sister
[1:38:31] Peggy needs a little cold drink right
[1:38:33] now of Living Water not not not some
[1:38:37] kind of sympathy I'm talking about
[1:38:39] living water something that'll really
[1:38:42] put strength in you
[1:38:47] yes he can still be found yes it says
[1:38:52] he's a rewarder
[1:38:54] of those that diligently seek
[1:38:56] him now if you're seeking him he's not
[1:38:59] going to give you a bucket of
[1:39:02] gold that's right right if you're
[1:39:05] seeking him and he's going to reward you
[1:39:07] for seeking him what's he going to do
[1:39:09] he's going to reveal himself to
[1:39:12] you and many times when he does that he
[1:39:16] stands right in your
[1:39:18] way he he stood in in the woman at the
[1:39:21] well he stood in her way while why he
[1:39:24] wanted to talk to her sometimes right
[1:39:27] God wants us to stop long
[1:39:30] enough long
[1:39:32] enough where he can talk to
[1:39:35] us and when he talks to you he puts
[1:39:38] strength in
[1:39:40] you as we bow our heads let's bow our
[1:39:44] heads Lord
