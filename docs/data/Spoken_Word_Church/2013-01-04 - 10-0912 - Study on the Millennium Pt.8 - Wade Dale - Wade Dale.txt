========================================

all right let's uh let's let's go and get started all right good to have everybody here we're all hooked up on the internet I want good stuff oh by the way we're going to have the ministers meeting in January here and uh the reason I'm telling you this is because uh we're gonna have two preachers that are going to be doing the meeting Richard Robertson Joseph Kansas yeah we're going to have a a lot of the ministers have been have have had problems with people on the internet and so daddy said well we got two of the best you know I want to learn something so that's what we're gonna do in January we're gonna have all the managers they're going to speak to them about how to control the internet and how to use it right and how to set things up so it'd be pretty interesting because we there's still several preachers my brother Tim Humes he don't have anything in no internet service or anything like that and he doesn't like it so anyway so Joseph and Richard are gonna are going to teach them how to use it you know what bothers me on our way it's not our website screen that comes that comfortable mine that's at the top our church is at the top or like the bottom Grand and false prophet have you seen that on the very same screen that our church is not on our website nurse the only Jesus we only need Jesus in other words we don't need a prophet right and it's discouraging yes yeah you can't help what other people put on all right Isaiah 53 that's what we're going to talk about Jesus this morning for those of you that have not been here long we are taking a view of God in His Son of God dispensation and it's a man dispensation and showing the differences and the similarities because I was thinking just a little while ago that we're not trying to divide this person into two all right this person is almighty God before the foundation of the world he does not change he's Hebrews 13 8. he's John 1 1. he's Hebrews one he's Colossians 1 and he's the one in the first of the book that says in the beginning God created the Heavenly Earth so if anybody picks us up on the Internet we are not advocating or promoting two different gods now for an example just I failed to put this on there maybe somebody May click on and see it but or hear it but today you look at me I'm one person all right but my title is Sun because I'm the son of my father right but you're still looking at the same person that's right all right I'm a husband that's a manifestation that I came about because of a revelation of having a wife right okay I could always be one I have the capability of always being a husband whether I'm married or not but the revelation of Me shows that I'm married because the manifestation of my wife all right I'm also a human being I have a body spirit and soul I was lost I was in sin see now God wasn't but we're still looking at one person not a not a and not as some of the people in the message preach that Jesus had different identities uh that's a schizophrenic right God's not as schizophrenic God is one right but he has many manifestations just like I'm standing here I have not moved I'm also a grandfather now my my features haven't changed now if I was eternal and Almighty and was standing here in my youth and never getting older I still could be a grandfather because that's what's inside of me to be a grandfather you understand what I'm saying yes and I can I can manifest that why because in a few moments my granddaughter is going to walk in and she's going to manifest me or show the manifestation of me being a grandfather um same way with my children father son husband human being um you know Deer Hunter um you know I mean whatever preacher or teacher Sunday school flop you know what I mean you know whatever I'm manifesting all these things even as a human being but I haven't moved I'm still standing in the same form I'm in I haven't changed and went over to another person or I have not brought another person into being except a person to show the manifestation of me like my wife would come into view that would show you that that's my wife and now that made me a husband she could step out of the picture and then my granddaughter could walk in and say oh he's a grandfather see that shows in manifest what I am but I'm only one person right and I don't have four or five personalities running around inside of me I can be a grandfather to my grandchild but I can't be a grandfather to my wife because that manifestation or revelation of me is based on what she is she's my granddaughter I can't live with her like I live with my wife you understand God can't live that's why I said God that's why brother around said God will have grandchildren God has a bride he has a wife and that wife is who he lives with but he manifests himself as he learned he's healing Sinners right now walk up in the go up to North Georgia Medical Center and walk in the door right that's right 90 of those people are not Christians what we call an even nominal Christian but God is just healing the wounds he's putting all these things he's he's healing the bones he's a Healer to anybody that wants to to have it he's a Healer Redeemer savior he's only your Redeemer the story um that brother Brandon told about the uh about the boy that was in the wagon and the wagon was heading toward the cliff and this man runs up and grabs the boy off of the wagon before he the wagon goes over the cliff one day that boy grew up and become a horse thief and horse thieves back in the old time that was just like stealing um anything and you were going to hang so this boy walks into the courtroom and he looks up and there's the man that saved him when he was a little boy the judge and the judge says what's your name and he said I'm so on so and so and so I'm John Brown I said don't you remember me sir he said no I don't remember he said you remember that boy that was going off the cliff he said you saved me he said um the man said well what's your case and he said well more Steve and they're going to hang me and he hits the goblin he says the law has spoke and the boy says sir so you saved my life and the man looked at him and said son that day I was your savior he said today I'm your judge see he had turned down that same man that was his savior was going to be his judge so Jesus Christ the same one that can save you one day he's going to be your judge if you don't accept it but it's a it's a it's our free moral agency our choice to choose he could be your savior or he can be your judge but he's still just one manifestation he's a he's the greatest savior in the world but he's going to be the greatest judge there is and it's only going to be because of who he is so this man that we're talking about it's not two different people because even his character I was thinking about this the other day even God's character down through the Old Testament through all those now not the bad parts of David the bad parts of Abraham the bad parts of of David and and all those people down through the Old Testament that we read but his character stayed the same he always wanted to redeem Israel when he talks about in the Old Testament he wants to redeem Israel but Israel is the one that went horn Israel's one that closed up their womb and wouldn't accept him and rejected him but he can't forget Israel because he said he couldn't and he's not going to he was all the things in the Old Testament because even in Isaiah it says in Isaiah 9 6 is going to be counselor Prince of Peace Mighty God Everlasting father all these titles to this one man but it's pointing toward this man because this man can die for us the Son of God cannot Die For Us Son of God is eternal God Spirit God before the foundation of the world but yet all of these any attribute that we show of God was in this right here before the foundation of the world that's right every attribute all right even you and I ran here before the foundation of the world and it's not like Dad and I were talking yesterday I think somebody that most people think that you were some little identity you know it's like I was explaining this is this is God and all this water it's like brother random explained about the ocean but this is God and this is eternal life which is the coffee inside here well you can't look down in there and see way down anywhere in that coffee it's just liquid but one day a drop of that liquid was deposited in here okay so there before the foundation world I was with him but not as a person right brother Brown said it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally but the seed of the word that drop right there right remember brother Brandon said the Drop in the Ocean it's just it's the same as the ocean but it has every chemical that the ocean has but it's not big like the ocean same way with eternal life that's why that the Bible says that the new birth is just the earnest of your inheritance and I don't like the word just because eternal life is the greatest thing you can have but it is just a drop that gets you started right in your journey I mean you just begin when you see that little drop go down in your soul take all the sin away that starts your journey that don't end your journey that starts your journey so that's the way you look at God is that God is all all and even when Jesus came on Earth same thing that same eternal life this same person right here was this person in human flesh right you just put that this now is human flesh in that same eternal life God took on a form of man the Bible says to take on sin for you and I but if you don't get it right then your understanding all the things that you read in the Bible you'll think well that's why the people in in the denominational World they don't understand God they see him over here as Jesus they see him over here as Jehovah they see him over here as this they see him over here that it's the same person it's that same eternal life same theophany God all the time he does not change he just took that theophany and one day he put it in a in a body of flesh called Melchizedek did the work of showing Abraham what would happen then brother Graham said he just dropped that body off went back to Spirit God right then that Spirit God one day through Isaiah 9 6 is a virgin shall conceive so this went into this now you got a human being standing as a baby just like me and you born through the womb of a woman not created but born through the womb of a woman just like me and you now he can be our brother right now we're going to read Isaiah 9 and Isaiah 53 and we're going to see these two not persons or even personalities we're going to see this one individual do two works all right so now let's read excuse me I do have believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed that's a question Isaiah's asking now he's going to answer that question about this right here where he should grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he has no form or commonness and when we shall see him there's no beauty that we should desire him in other words he didn't come down like catfish with everything all you know prettied up in his beard trimmed just really nice and I hope his cuticles on this you know no no he came in a Manger born the worst way you could be born came up poor um probably looked kind of ragged every once in a while you know and he didn't keep his beard trimmed he didn't go I don't believe he went to the barber every week all right he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hit it as was our face from him he was despised and we esteemed a night now who's he talking about he's talking about this man the one that's going to come and die for us okay he's talking to the son of man he has despised and rejected of men a man of sorrow acquainted with grief we hidden where our face from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our grief and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted see it looked like on the cross that he was being judged by God which he really was that flesh was being judged by God but Caiaphas was looking at it as well I see there he's nothing anyway God's bringing judgment down on him because of the way he acted toward all these people all these all these um meetings that he had and he got all the people all riled up see but it wasn't it was God doing the work verse five but he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way remember at the cross what happened they all left him and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all remember there was 400 and something scriptures fulfilled just at the three hours of calvary he was oppressed he was deflected yet he opened on his mouth he was brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before his shears is done so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison from judgment who shall declare his generation for he was cut off what would you how would he cut off he was killed you can't have another generation if you die if you don't have children but they were looking at the natural man here Isaiah is speaking of the natural man but he's asking a question watch Lucio declares generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken that'll take you back to Daniel 9 24 of what we've been on before and he made his grave with the wicked so he is the person and when the rich and his death who was it remember who was it uh um the rich man's one that gave him the tomb to be buried him because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief but Thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see a seed now up above there we see that that is talking of Jesus Christ the son of man because all these things were happening to a flesh man a fleshly person right of Jesus Christ and he ended that part by saying he was what he would come as a lamb to his shears dumb it pleased the Lord to bruise him put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul and offering for sin he shall see us see that's how that Isaiah is answering the question in verse 8. who shall declare his generation it's not the body of Jesus the body of Jesus is the sacrifice just like the lamb was a sacrifice but this was a human sacrifice but what did he sacrifice he gave his body remember John on the River Jordan when he washed Jesus he was fulfilling the Old Testament because you have to wash the sacrifice before you make the offering so John washed the sacrifice in the River Jordan Jesus didn't need to be baptized he was the almighty God right because John said I need to be baptized to you and he said suffer it to be so in other words I know I know that but to fulfill all righteousness in other words to fulfill the Old Testament you got to put me in the water and wash me you're the high priest I'm the sacrifice you got to watch me all right so the son of man was the Lamb of God they took away the sin of the world but now to see his generation progress we know that Jesus didn't have a wife he didn't have natural children but Isaiah is asking who shall declare his generation for he was cut off from the land of the living here the living the one we're seeing right here this living in other words Abel the same way when when Cain killed Abel Abel had not procreated so there was no genealogy of Abel anymore because Abel was cut off in his generation but in a tight God raised up Seth right raised up Seth as a type of Christ being raised up to start a generation a spiritual generation which is this one right here he shall make his soul and offering for sin he'd already put his body a sacrifice for our transgression for our healing he was willing for our transgression bruised for our iniquity with his stripes we were healed that was not this part that was this part this part had to go through that to release what see it was the animal life that was released but he couldn't come back on the believer but it was a death but to release the life of a lamb you gotta kill it to release the life of the Lamb of God the man had to kill it kill him to release what now Isaiah's telling you that when thou shalt make his soul and offering for sin who's the soul of Jesus Christ almighty God the Son of God the Creator God the one that's got all the eternal life in it but to get this out of this cup if it was sealed to get this out of this cup I'd have to break the cup when Jesus said there's none perfect no not one he was talking about his flesh sure that's why the soul of God was he can't tempt God but that son of man could be tempted sure absolutely went through points just like we all do that's the perfect sacrifice well Jesus could look at his hands and see that they didn't look like they did when he was 20. he could look in the mirror if there was such thin I guess it was and know that he was getting older he was not in his perfect condition so when they said who's perfect he said there's nothing perfect but God the one inside of it and you can say the same thing there's none perfect but God but the god inside of him exalted him the Bible says up above so high he's going to look down to see heaven now because of what what was inside of it that's right this is the perfect God you say is this the imperfect God no no that was the sacrifice right because remember that sacrifice had to be perfect also Jesus was just saying in his Humanity he was saying don't worship this man worship the father right but now when Jesus comes on John and Patmos I believe he he accepted the worship because he was in his fullness even after the resurrection he was in his fullness that was almighty God right well yeah well it was almighty God walking on the face of the Earth before his death but there was a time that all this right here had to happen God was bottled up inside of that human being and could not get out because he said he couldn't until he broke the vessel until the lamb was slain when that lamb was slain it released what this soul that we're talking about all right when he said I found some God and I go to God when he came through God was that in the infant form when he was born he came from God no he came from this right here yeah it came from this right and he went right back to this if this is if this is light which we know it is right we prove that in the Old Testament he went from light to flesh and he went back to life brother Brown said the flesh is on the altar and said Paul met Jesus Christ but not Jesus Christ the flesh man that walked on the face of the Earth this body's laying as a sacrifice now like Daddy said it's not laying lifeless it's all types and shadows and and um exactly they can't come back here or he could walk back down here that's right but his body is holding somewhere sent the Holy Ghost back which is the same person but that flesh man's not walking on the face of the Earth that's right right you can't do it not until the Millennium right he's the one that said it can't dwell in an unclean vessel so this Earth is not clean until the millennium and then it's only partially cleaned but it's clean enough for God to walk on but yeah the body in City he come from I come from God and I go back to God in other words he made a journey from from the Son of God in the Old Testament Jehovah and it wouldn't bother me if you put I came from Jehovah I go back to Jehovah because he's still Jehovah God until he's revealed as the son of man Jesus Christ to the Jews he still Jehovah Abraham he stealed Jehovah to Isaac and Jacob and all those people that's why I say it's going to be a great time when we get over there there's going to be a lot of people that's not even going to understand what happened and we're going to have an eternity to be able to discuss just this right here right and not be tired and have to keep looking at clocks and you know have the cares of life and have to worry about going home and going to work and driving eight hours and all that but one day we'll be able to tell people Isaiah couldn't understand that he he sure he he wrote this and pinned it but he remember he penned it by the Holy Spirit that's right he may have had a vision of Jesus Christ I don't know but when he said of urgent shall conceive that was way out I mean that can happen in the end time because they can do artificial insemination but what they're doing is they're just proving that that happens supernaturally with God because God didn't inject a sperm and an egg into Mary that's right it was a creative germ it was all I mean it was already connected a lot of people in this message don't see that either it wasn't that that God said Okay I want to put an egg in Marion and I'm going to put a sperm no that wouldn't be a sex act that's right no egg and sperm were already just spoken and it's stuck in that womb and it was ready to go that's right no sensation with a sensation you got to have an act right he said there was no sensation Mary had no sensation except 28 Days Later she had to she had to prophesy for 28 days not seeing a thing going on nothing she didn't feel nothing it should have felt anything it would not have been God doing it okay but that had but see there was he coming I come from God I dropped down into human flesh and I go back to God now he's never going to drop that human flesh anymore because he will be you know everybody and we're going to get into this a couple of Sundays because the Bible says the that sonship will terminate that he may be all in all but let me give you a little key God always was this right right God always was this right in his mind he knew this was what he was going to be so you're never in all eternity you're never going to say okay he's never was a son he the son never existed because the way the Bible and the way the people in the message say well and even brother Brown and brother Branham says should you say Eternal son he's talking to the Catholic people the Catholics believe in eternal sonship an eternal father an eternal son and an eternal Holy Ghost three gods that's what brother Rand was talking about he wasn't saying that that you know it'll be wiped away and you'll never know I'll always know he was the son of God right I'll always know that that man died for me that son of man amen because that's some man standing right here today it's God in human flesh all over again that's right because he took this life that was in him bottled up in this man and as the day of Pentecost there was 120. of these into human flesh three thousand of these in the human flesh down Through the Ages always been the son of God Sons and Daughters of God which is God in another form that's the way God wanted it all right let's finish reading it he shall make his soul and offering for sin what he shall see his seed he didn't say when he gave his flesh he said when he gave his soul the flesh was a sacrifice to pay for all this that we're doing right here all this human sin that we're doing right but remember that Son of God this right here this man never sinned right this man didn't either but this man never sinned a day in his life and if that's inside of you that person never sinned a day in his life right never said a bad word never was married two or three times never did drink never did smoke never did gamble never did have a dirty thought right that's right okay that's what he was given he was being able to break this flesh and release this you can't say it another way but this person right but it's not too persons right but he this is what he decided because we're reading what he decided this is what God decided to do and he went into Isaiah Jeremiah he said this is what I'm going to do I'm gonna do this and this is the way I'm going to do it because remember he said in Genesis 3 I'm going to do it you can't do it Adam you messed up you failed told Abraham he said Abraham you're not going to do it I'm gonna do it so this man said he was going to do it he decreed he was going to do it and said this is how I'm going to do it some God going to the son of man to release the life had to pay the debt first what went to hell the flesh or the soul of God the soul of God soul that God had to pay that Ransom right the son of man paid the ransom for the world what we're doing it Brews Brews for our iniquity can't bruise the Son of God that's right Son of God can't transgress Son of God Son of God didn't take a stripe today in his life but this man did that's right to pay the natural price you know what I was reading you uh Friday was praying he said God he said thank you for your blood he said but I'm standing in front greater than your blood right greater he said I'm standing in front of the purchase you can have the blood in your hand all day long you can rub yourself with it you can just you can drown in it that won't save your soul that's right but if you believe that that man right there came in this man right to this man right here came down as this man paid your price for what you're looking at now and what you can't see to get you back to here that's greater than any blood chemistry you understand chemistry but the life of the blood that's what he was saying he said God he said thank you for your blood he said but thank you for letting me stand in something greater than your blood he said stand in front of the purchase of that blood right okay so what was the the blood of the son of man didn't save nobody the natural blood but when that man did what he did so willingly did what he did to release this guy right here this is the one he made an offering for sin so he what he shall see a seed in other words his generation then it's going to be propagated through the spoken word now through Jesus Christ giving his life and we believe it on him that same life that was in Jesus Romans 8. if the spirit that brought raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you either Quicken your mortal body that's right by his what spirit that dwelleth in you son of God so the son of man but that was the Same Spirit now Same Spirit it's just this was in a human flesh this was a sacrifice for everything we did out here but that right there that man right there is the one that decreed in Genesis I'll do it right but I'm going to do it through here right I'm gonna come as the seed of the woman that's right and I'm going to save your soul and then I'm going right back to here because I can't get into you as the son of man Jesus can stand all he wants to beside of us there's no way he can get inside of us that's right it's fleshly that's right he had to go back to Spirit God so he could come down in spirit form as the Holy Ghost to come into he had to go back to God that's right he had to go back to God he had to release this life this life right here this man went to hell that's right so you don't have to because you went with it you've already been to Hell right so it's over you don't have to go anymore you already went one time let's finish reading before we're done yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he has put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul and offering for sin he shall see a scene he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hands he shall see the travail of his soul not Jesus's soul Jesus is on his soul was the same he's saying my soul or his voice but Isaiah is saying his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquity therefore will I divide him a portion with the great he shall divide the spoil of the strong because he has poured out his soul unto death so can't die he said he poured out his soul unto death not in death because Jesus never died one more thing before we go bill um wild billions bless his heart last night or yesterday we were talking about kind of a little bit about this he said even if I go to the Grave he said I've already got a tape player and he said I want that tape player put in my coffin and it's screaming he's not dead he's not dead he's not dead you can't kill him Christians but you know how Bale is everybody knows pretty animated but he said if they have to put me in the grave and he said I told him play this cassette tape I'm not there you can't kill me that's right and I can see him if he ever did I can see that going all through that funeral home I'm not well that's true that's right yes sir that's right this flesh died this flesh died to show you the Lamb of God that took away the son of the world but this man right here is the one that really did the work because he's the one to come back in here and resurrected if that had not been in the son of man he would have never resurrected that's right but he had to come back without any all right Same Spirit that raise up Jesus from the dead it was quick and your mortal Body by his spirit that dwells in you now there was one man Jesus Christ that had that in him now there's many the Bible says many sons right just like him now not lower form Jesus said join heirs right that's right here that ain't right here that's right here all right see you in a couple weeks y'all pray for me today if I don't get over there and save time dude
