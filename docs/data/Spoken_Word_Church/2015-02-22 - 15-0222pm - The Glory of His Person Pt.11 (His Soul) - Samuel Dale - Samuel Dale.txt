we'll go to Acts 2 and then Genesis 1 Revelation 1 Acts 2 Genesis 1. good to see everybody we had a house full this morning and uh we uh pray that the Lord would bless I had to kind of turn the message because of a lot of company being with us and everything but it still gave an opportunity to kind of just lay a little uh point in I believe that will help us this afternoon and be able to follow it better remember now brother Aaron will be preaching for us to come in this coming Wednesday remember the Bible study first Saturday fellowship meeting on the third Saturday brother Matthew Bray will be preaching for us on that weekend so remember that remember Wade be traveling going to the Philippines and pray that the Lord would bless and take care of him and everything and we we just we say God bless because that's the way he will do we try to do his work and he'll he'll do the blessing if we do his work all right Revelation anything else in the announcements I generally missed something Heavenly Father we thank you for this day thank you for all of the things Lord that you've given us and we know that you give them to us freely so then that way we don't have to try to make any arrangements to pay for them to try to get them or pay for them after we get them we just rest in you and we believe you Lord that you'll take care of all things and guide each and every one Lord we ask you to be with us and and keep us and father just touch each one remember the sick among us and may we all walk up right in you in saying that by your stripes we are healed and we believe it and we thank you just have your way now and keep us in Jesus name amen Revelations one and I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last what thou see us write in the book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia unto some Ephesus and unto Smyrna and unto pergamas and unto taitara and into Sardis and unto Philadelphia and then on the lady of SIA and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one likened to the son of man clothed the Garment down to the foot and gird about the pouch with a golden girdle we're still on this great person right so now let's go to Acts two in just one verse 31 he's seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ that his soul was not left in Hell neither his flesh did see corruption all right then we'll try to get to our thought in Genesis of 1 26 and 27 and uh then we'll go on from there because we're going to try to continue what we were talking about this morning but try to get it down to understanding more about this part that we are all right and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them out dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the iron over the cattle and over all the Earth and over ever creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created him male and female created he them you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we uh I said I just kind of redone and went a little bit different direction this morning because of a lot of company and you know that way you just don't keep driving on because people don't understand what you're talking about you don't want to do that so you want to help as much as you can and it gives us a time to consider a lot of things but now we've been talking about the nature of God and how that nature displays that doing in his creation he displays his nature his ways his being because of the way that he created things and how that he was to to bring that into being would show his very nature of that being that was doing it and everything was created perfect nothing out of order everything perfect not Eternal because you can't create eternal all right but in doing that he was actually displaying his own nature down to Mankind we could go through all of the creation of the Earth the animals the things you know and do but we just jumping over to the creation of man but I don't want you to forget one thing that we're talking about God being real talking about God being a being Not Just Like the Wind you know but he's a being he's a spirit all right we say what God is a spirit all right that's true these are spirited that's wonderful but really he's a spiritual being right because if you just related Spirit then you're rolling back to your point of not allowing him to um manifest himself because how can he manifest himself as a Healer savior Redeemer Etc if he's doing it only in the point of just saying that God is a spirit all right so then he has to condescend and in doing that in condescending downward then we can look at the things as they take place and we can look and see that truly he is the beginning of the creation not that he had a beginning but that he within himself was Desiring to display himself all right and to do that he would have to come into being in our Realm right in in the realm of mankind okay see then that way he would put us in this realm and then he would come into this realm as to do that remember what we we had the drawing and I don't want to use it right now I'll use it in a minute on the the drawing that we've been using but remember the line and dividing in eternity and remember that we've been been quite a time over on the the side over here into the in the beginning but before the eternal and bringing that down but now we're beginning to come over to the other side or come over into uh time as we would say and uh doings of life but just remember now you remember the drawing that we gave that whatever is on one side will have to be on the other side whatever he's displaying now as his attributes he had to have those attributes before he ever started anything all right and that that way then you would not be leaving something out he never gained attributes you know he displayed his attributes all right all of those attributes you want to talk about healing savior et cetera Etc we're in him before the world but not to the point that he was displaying him right but they was a part of him part of his nature part of his ways part of his being and he begins to reveal himself to you and I and the way he does that is by condescending all right coming more into the realm where we're at because he knew what we would be that even the best in the garden would be a problem he knew if he made Adam and Eve and gave him a choice that they would fall he knew all of that so then he knew that he could display his attributes from that but looked like he would have just said now wait just a minute I just won't bring the devil into being I'll just do all this other and we'll have a wonderful time but he couldn't display his attributes so he had to permit it had to allow us to come into being now I want you to hold the next two services with me or at least this service um hold it to not thinking about you as much as thinking about him coming into being all right everybody follow me that how that God comes into being into being for us to understand it not that he come into being that he wasn't into being didn't he come into being and you know no no I don't have an education I'm sorry so you just have to put up with the way I speak but how that he will bring himself into being right so that we can understand him all right we're going to talk about today his soul all right you remember this morning we dealt with that you know and uh dealing just a little bit about the soul right at the end and the Soul being who you are and what you are your being and things so go ahead brother you don't know who's back there now they got where they're putting the kids in and we appreciate these kids for for helping them but they're they're sharp on that too so this is what the the Old Testament let's see yeah we've got the Greek and then we got the Hebrew the Old Testament word Soul where it comes our you know when he created Adam become a living Soul see it means life mind heart it means like the Breath of Life the vital force which animates the body and shows itself in breathing of animals of men see it connects to that part of animal but they don't have that Soul all right but the that in which there is life a living being a living soul the seat of the feelings desires affections and things heart no the human soul insofar as it is uh what is that word constituted That by The Right Use of the AIDS offered it by God it can attain its highest end and secure Eternal blessedness the soul regarded as a moral being designed for everlasting life the soul as an essence which differs from the body and is not dissolved by death see even they know that by the definition of the word distinguished from the other parts of the body all right now that's the Old Testament form let's use the New Testament form it just picks up just a little bit better into understanding because this is you know where I think it's the scripture where Jesus said my soul is troubled I'm sure that's where it come from but look at 5315 and it goes into soul self life creature person appetite mind living being desire emotion passion all right that which breeds the breathing substance are the being so the inner being of man living being living being with the life in the blood the man himself person or individual so that's what our soul is now here's Webster and I hope they didn't use mine I hope they typed it because boy mine is a mess uh did you use that one not I'll give it to you Webster says that the word soul is the principle of life feeling thought an action of man it's the spiritual part of man as distinct from the physical body it's a human being it's a person the embodiment of some quality it means Spirit it means heart it means Essence it means core you know sinner of anything all right that's why the Bible will talk about the heart of man all right but that doesn't mean the thumping gizzard you know that means the core or Essence are the part of you that really makes you what you are your being and it makes you a person see then that's what it was so then when we get over in a little bit to where it says let us make man in our image then you'll see you know it'll tie together with what we were talking about this morning in the basis of talking about the soul and how that he gave his soul to redeem us all right now because that that will bring us to the rightful position now we've give this quote right here a lot but I love it I don't know how many more times I'll read it because I love the quote itself even though it seems like that you know it gives you a problem with understanding but with our understanding corrected by the prophet and the Holy Spirit why should we have any problem about you know the things look what he says on the questions and answers on Genesis paragraph 21 now if God created man in his own image and his his own likeness what kind of a man did he create a spirit man now if you'll notice after he had made all the creation and created a spirit man okay raised it on up and said he made man in his own image to lead the cattle now that's in Soul theophany all right now we're going to get down to some points because well we'll hold on he made manners on image to lead the cat to leave the Beast to the field just like the Holy Spirit leads the believer today all right now that's not the natural flesh of Adam that was in his spiritual creation now watch though he was in other words Adam the first man in the lower creations of God the first creation was God himself that doesn't mean God is creating you know now we'll get to the other point in a second and watch now but watch the first creation was God himself then out of God came to logos which was the son of God and out of the Lord Gods which was the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us out of the Lord Gods came forth came the man all right the man of what the man that was created in the image of God to lead the animals not as a flesh man he was leading the animals at Spirit man spiritual being all right in the image of God all right go ahead with the next one because this is what I want to this is an insert so you'll see I didn't underline because brother random says here in the church age book 336 the beginning of the creation of God that is who the Lord Jesus says he is but those words don't mean exactly as they sound to us just taking them the way they sound has made some people in fact multitudes of people get the idea that Jesus was the first creation of God making him lower than godhead then this verse now remember that's what they think there's where your Trinity concept comes into being see that God created Jesus then Jesus created everything because they know by the Bible Hebrews 1 John 1 Colossians 1 James 3 and what is it it's not James Ephesians 3 and 9 that Jesus Christ was the creator all right of everything nothing was created when all the Bible said so then people think that God created Jesus and Jesus created everything else all right but he says that's not right says all right in fact multitudes the people get the idea that Jesus was the first creation of God making him lower than God hid then this first creation created all the rest of the universe and whatsoever it contains but that is not right you know that doesn't line up with the rest of the Bible the words are he is the beginning or author of the creation of God now we know for surety that Jesus is God very God he is the creator all right now watch John 1 3 declared him to be that and made by him he's the one who is said in Genesis 1 1 the beginning God created heaven the Earth he's also in Exodus 20 and 11 then in six days the Lord created to heavens and the Earth and all and and rested the seventh see there is no doubt that he is the creator he was the creator of a finished physical creation surely we can see what these words mean now to have any other interpretation would mean that God created God how could God be created when he himself is the creator all right is that a simple answer then when he says that that first creation is God himself he's not talking about creating himself you know no he's not saying that well something had to create now it means he's coming into being to word that we can comprehend amen all right and see the trinitarian concept would be glad to take Jesus as God creating Jesus and in Jesus creating everything else that is your trinitarian concept that's where they come up with a God in three persons in a different thing because they can look back there and they can see that that logos that theophany that things it was said would be called by the theologians the Son of God Amen amen you remember how we were bringing that out how the prophet brings it out how he brought it out in his first quote right and God created man in his own image then what kind of a man did he create a spirit man right see then in getting it lined up correctly all we got to do is find one thing okay go ahead and quote number two and let's see what we've got to find all right this is questions and answers on Genesis paragraph 13 atheistic rolling on up to save because we've got to do we'll stop on the reading what connection does this Genesis 1 26 how would Genesis 2 7. God created two men that's their question now and which was the man in which what connection does that have what how does it connect up in the scripture well if you'll notice close now in Genesis 1 26 let's get the first part first God said let us now let us is is a US is a let us make man in our own image our course we realize he's talking to someone he was speaking to another being now remember we went through that that's not the father and son discussing that's word and spirit if not father and son it's two people separated discussing it it's word and spirit it's coming into being so watch what he said let us make man in our own image after our likeness and let them out dominion over the cattle to the field if you notice in creation the first thing that was created of course was light you come on down to the creation the last thing was created was what a man and one was made after the man all right the first the last thing that was created of God's creation is mankind but when God made his first creation if you notice he made him in the likeness of himself he was made in the image of God and what is God right now if we can find out what God is we can find out what kind of a man he made right now that's your Prophet describing it to it so all we need to do is find out what kind of a Man was created and then when we do we'll find out about God but when we find out about God we find out about man because if you're going with a scripture to make Man In His Image all right whatever that image is is going to be displayed well remember whatever this is if this is in the image of it it is not a second part or anything it's the same being right now we're going to get down to some technical hard things and some of you are going to immediately think that I'm going with a lot of the doctrines of the pre-existences and things but you better remember for 40 something years I've fought those doctrines of pre-existence even to it being a Mormon doctrine of pre-existence of souls a prophet said he didn't believe in now he believed in the pre-existence of eternal life he believed in the pre-existence of God all right but he didn't believe in the pre-existence of mankind as we are right as we are he never believed it that way because it won't line up with the rest of the scripture all right so then we got to keep it in line but if we can find out what God is we can find out what kind of a man he made right is that what he said about it now what did he make going to the next we've been over a lot of these but try to put them together and I run them all where you could read them for yourself and take them home with you and if I was you I'd keep these for next Sunday because we will background a lot on it okay look what he says on the message Souls that are in prison now preaches 63. and then first man was made and then first man was made he was made a spirit being in the image of God which God is a spirit Saint John 4. now he is a a spirit and they that worship Him worship Him in spirit and in truth and thy word is the truth now we worship Him in spirit in truth he is a a spirit being then there was no man to tell the soil and then God formed man out of the US to the Earth all right so the spirit man the answer of the question of what the two beep part man you know or whatever he first has created a spirit man amen in the image of God you might as well swallow remember if you are a true child of God and you have eternal life there is only one form of eternal life that's why you are called an offspring of God what is an offspring of God well it's a kitty head let's don't get it too dirty all right what is an offspring of God thank you is God in another form no you tell me any other definition a child of God that is real a child of God now we're not talking about all the other parts that goes around if you have eternal life today remember there's only one Eternal amen and that is what God's own life amen you remember the other week when Wade was bringing it out there and talking about the uh the part of us being co-equal was that the one the Bible says that we're co-equal ity what do you think about a soul then you'll see I wasn't playing this morning I was just wording it different if your soul has eternal life where did it get it it can only be God's own life right right sure right now think about it the first man was a spirit being in the image of God now I'm making it as hard as I can to worry that you can think when you were talking about image we try to make it as well um John brother college boy looks like him you know he's a very spitting image of his daddy he looks like him not James what's the other one Myron Myron looks like him he looks like it but he's not in the spitting image identical twins or not spitting the image because there'll be some difference in somewhere some part you see we want to make image as being a picture taken move it why not get serious and think about that he said let us make man in our own image are we a creation of God if you think remember if we are creation of God we would be something separate from God my brother tell you to make him just a little too strong no I'm not ain't making it strong enough yet that's right yeah you stick around you might find some more words but when you talk about the image and likeness was that man that was made in Genesis was it Adam yeah he received the name of Adam to make it a clarification but remember whatever was in Adam and we won't go that far but we're going to go there the Eve was in Adam and she never had a name and even after she was created her name was woman right she never received the name until she fell so I would think I told you I said when he dated I'm going to preach on the godhead um I'd listen but now if it's in the image then Jesus was in the image of God does that make him a second person are you with me was Jesus the second person brother random said he wasn't even the first person you remember he gave that two or three times he said he is the person that now you've gone too far cause you're gone into Oneness nope because you see I don't have any problem with Jesus standing there praying to his father and saying it out loud I'm a little trouble with that if you say then I'll remind ask you when why don't you just not pray out loud now don't you just shut up and just pray to yourself if you're in that way all right see we're not getting down to the understanding of the Bible that the prophet was trying to bring to us about what we are and it certainly would not help us to remain with our trinitarian concept as to him being one person and us being another one but I just can't see brother Dale it's your God well you want me to call Brother Brown's name and let him read it you know would you respect it more in him or would you respect it more in Jesus when he would be saying things and do you mind if I quote brother Bradham he said sometimes the father was speaking and sometimes Jesus was speaking now you deal with that is that trinitarian no is it Oneness no this Prophet is the only one who could divide that line between the trinitarian concept and the Oneness he said they both are truth who said we want the truth all right amen so he made a spirit being but yet he had that spirit being the end he created man from the soul and the man from the saw was not in the image of God remember it was in the image of animals right foot like a bear and like a chimpanzee or something you know the highest form of animal s so what is he let's read a little going to number four which is taken from the cruelty of sin and the penalty that caused to get rid of that sin from our lives paragraph 51. so he couldn't just leave it in that state it leaves something with it check what he's talking about back before then all right so he said let us plural make man plural in our own image and let us let us make man in our own image so then when God made his first man he was the spirit man he was something on the order of God or the son of God the Lord gosh that was the first man then he gave the man jurisdiction over the to lead to all the animals life just like the Holy Spirit leads the believer today go here to them but look what he says it's what I'm saying see we want to put I'm trying to hold this to a point of talking about his soul instead of talking about us but we've got to talk about us but now remember one thing there's over related quotes that lean and go backwards and forth but remember Cain don't fit to her right even Abel don't fit there right so he's talking about one man Adam all right yeah the rest of us is there but we'll have to be brought out in understanding right and later as we go along but look what he's saying first man was a spirit man that wasn't all mankind that was Adam but he wouldn't Adam at that time he was part of God yeah but you're getting it a little too close to deity brother Dale I hope let me let me quote him off let me quote brother mode about something years ago he said you can't go no further off into let's see how did he say he said you you go into unbelief and you know in paraphrasing his wording and he says you can't be any worse going this way then you can go over that away you know you talk about well it's wrong to do this it's wrong to do that and we know it is but you can't be no worse there than you are on the other side of the fence trying to prop up yourself as to being something good see because it doesn't bring out to the right order all right let's just keep it what I'm talking about I'm really driving a point today of talking about God and who he is and that not that he has a soul but that he is a soul he's a being he's a person he's not a person that has a person maybe one of these days we'll realize why brother Branham would make a statement one day he said A True Believer taking the word upon his and he say upon his heart or something and speak upon his lips he said it's deity speaking you might realize something's taking place Among Us that we need to understand look at number five this is taken from the message of questions and answers on Genesis paragraph 43 then he asked the question he made the bees the monkeys and everything let us who father and son I don't mind giving these quotes it sounds like it's trinitarians I just gave you three quotes there where it says let us plural father son and who's he talking about another being I don't believe right around was confused do you know I might not know what he's talking about there but I don't believe he was confused I believe he believed it but I believe he had an understanding that when he said one day he said let's stand and address the third person of the trinity brother branham's preached for 40 something years that there was one God but look at that really he meant this three he finally come out and told it but he only told it one time like a brother up in Indiana one time I believe it was told his other brother said brother Brandon was deity the brother Tony said I don't think that's right now because because he said here if you make me God you make me an antichrist he said he only said them things to throw you off he said well he done a good job throwing me off because I don't believe it because that would be the way to go over it but look then he asked this question now let us who Father and Son make man our own image now if a man was made something like that little sacred light Yonder or something like that it could not be seen which is a spiritual being he manifested or unfolded himself a little more to make a trinity of himself by father Son and the Holy Spirit and here was God unfolded himself now down into let us make man which was his son an offspring from him man in his own image he was a supernatural being now are we The Offspring of God I'll bring it over to us by the new birth you know because you can't make that back there the wrong thing all right and Paul would say it's Christ and you the hope of glory what kind of an image are you talking about he says that that man that was made there led to cattle everything just like the Holy Spirit leads to the real True Believer today watch the voice of God out there and watch him change the voice of man rather and God didn't name the animals right brother Lewis Adam named the animal God didn't name him the voice of man brother would speak and say call the cattle this way call the Sheep over to this pastor call the fishes to the water see he had Dominion everything obeyed him look what that spiritual man in the garden had amen had Dominion now let's pick up some wording as we continue in the process of looking at some things go ahead with number six which is Hebrews chapter 4. paragraph 2 29 230. and he's talking about the actual this life in anything that begins has an end and eternal without a beginning Etc he said was God a man certainly you know it took a long time to get people to think about Melchizedek was a man I remember those days I'm talking about the people of the message since I've been around okay when they say Melchizedek you remember they said to brother Brown said that wasn't God he said yeah he said he was even a man then you go about Hebrews 7 4 or what where somewhere right in there where it says the man the Melchizedek it took a long time to get beat into people 's mind that you about man and God what was God was God a man certainly let us make man in our own image what was God a theophany a body and their man was made like that a man was made like that he's talking about God and put over the garden but there was no man to till the soil in the senses then he created man Out of the Dust of the earth Etc and God the theophany come down and was made flesh and dwelt among us to redeem the man you didn't have any trouble bringing it down to the correct order did you but he talks about this and we used it while ago and he talked about him being a spiritual being we talked about him being a spirit man from the quotes now he talks about a theophany how real do you think a theophany is I'll show you where I'm going don't mind at all I hope you think on it and brother random saw those people beyond the curtain of time he could feel them he said they had senses he said they even had intelligence that was their theophany we model to think about how real things really are and we might begin to comprehend the reality of God go ahead to the next one which is in the same message as Hebrews chapter 2. now the logos that went out of God which was the the logos all this being deformed into a body shape and this body shape was called in the scholars teaching logos the logos that went out of God in other words a better word for it was what we call it theophany now watch him theophany is a human body that's glorified now start right there you got a problem right but what does he say not exactly with flesh and blood like it will be in its glorified State all right now he's making a difference but it's a form but it is of a form of a human body that doesn't eat neither does it drink where do we get the Melchizedek with that one right but it's it's a body the body that's waiting for us as soon as we leave this one now in there we enter into that body and that's the kind of body that God was for he said let us make man in our own image in her likeness is your God real remember the key that he's and you'll find it even in beyond the curtain of time when they said here we don't eat but around him and say look at that male chatted it said he ate a cave drank some milk but then he'll declare that it was a theophany that was there and it was sure see the theophany was on the inside of a flesh the flesh was created is that what the prophet said he said he just went over and looked out and said here Gabriel step into that one Michael step into that one he said not just step into this one see the outside man the flesh is what ate the case the Inside Man didn't have to eat so we spread around his right well she has a dick did eat because how can you separate that man that you're looking at they're sitting there looking at you you can't separate him you're looking at a human man I remember Aaron made a statement back a long time ago and I want him to find that if he has the quote but he said God just simply sprinkle flesh over to theophany and he walked out but uh there I can't find that exact quote maybe he can and we'll give it to us but I know we made that statement years ago you know I believe it I believe he just sprinkled over that flesh I mean over that theophany he just sprinkled flesh over it and just walked down right right then brother Dale you must believe the theophany of man is the soul of man all right and that that soul of man is real well that's exactly what I believe you see right there that man was standing there eating that calf and things but if he wanted to he could just step out of that flesh and just leave that flesh and there he stands looking at it because you're talking about God you're not talking about idiotic stupidities of you and I you're talking about something real and right around and let those people beyond the curtain of time he failed them he said now even let me explain it to you he said women he said but let me tell you something over there that's been taken away that he wanted to make sure we understood that right but look the kind of body that God was for he said let us make man and our enemies and our likeness theophany is a human body that's glorified not exactly where Flesh and Blood like it will be in the glorified state but it's a form of a human body now make it look comical you know inside of you we'll read it right around said today is a man he said now do you believe that I got it in my notes either today or next week one well what size is that man that's inside of you wait it wouldn't be 50 years old but who would it look like well it looks like brother Cauley they just flipped a coin and got them mixed up when they birthed and none exactly right come on uh who does that look like that you'll get around one of these days and realize what I said this morning is true that soul that you are is more real than your body are your spirit or anything this away because even in the Fallen estate you still have the creative ability handed down from almighty God to do great things look at the things man has achieved in the past 50 years 100 years one of these days you'll realize this thing got more to do with it than what we think go ahead to number eight taking them questions and answers on Hebrews 3. what do we do well my dear sainted brother my dear sainted sister before the foundation of the world when God created you in His image I I thought it created in Genesis 1 26-27. well Genesis 1 26-27 is before the world he said no it was a sixth day I'd like for you to read of the Animal Creations when when you get a chance uh when was the animals created fifth day Man was created the sixth day but I'd like for you to read those two and declare that unto me because seemingly when you get over into talking of the sixth day that you you come in to a little difference of a way of stating things read them and you'll begin to wonder which day did the animals come because on the sixth day they were told to multiply but they wouldn't on the fifth day they were created okay that'll solved think about it before the foundation of the world when God created You In His Image or created The Man In His Image I love him to correct it like that because as a sinner could read that and it sure wouldn't fit too good all right so he says the man in the image and created the woman in the image of the man do you remember that when Adam was put in flesh he was lonely you know why because Eve was still in theophany that's what brother Branham says he said she was in him in creation spiritual said she was in him in creation natural then one of the people of this message want to preach so much about the hybrid woman making her a piece of dog meat and we're a great big old porterhouse today man we we filmed get away from that brother Dale would they call him watch what he said the man in His image and created a woman in the image of the man for the glory of the man he made a theophany just like himself when he said let us to the creatures that he had made now we've got four things that he uses it four things he uses about speaking was something now he talks about the creatures that he made he looked at the animals and said now hey look you need somebody to lead you I'm not going to go down here and be around here all the time I'm going to turn you over to somebody else he said let us what do y'all want him to be monkey says I'd like for him to be upright that's brother Louise when he's going the other day I was just sitting there I had to let me up here for a few minutes you know when the monkey says stand him up like me a lot of your smart animals would say make him like me I'm smarter than they are okay I sat there wanting to preach but he had the flow worship all right I enjoyed it he said let us to the creatures that he made let us make man in our own image in our likeness a theophany God had never become flesh yet he was in a theophany when Man was created God had never come into flesh yet he was in a theophany and Moses saw him Moses cried Lord let me see you all right what about it get too much information go ahead with number nine this was taken from questions and answers on Hebrews and that's where the Saints will be in a thousand years and what kind of a body they'll have so go ahead and roll it on up to now when the logos went out of God which was God coming from this one big Fountain into a body in the form of of a man and it made the logos which we call theophany now if you take the theophany when you are looking at that that's a man now that we now that's where we were in the beginning yep okay now you do not understand it now that's right but you was back there in the beginning that way when man made when God made Man In His Image he made him at the offney and he only placed him in flesh when God made Man In His Image in his likeness they were in Genesis 2 then you know you go from one to 128. then God brought a man a little lower down and put him in an animal life first man brought a little lower you know first man theophany Spirit man brought a little lower a little lower down and put him in animal of life that's his body just like the animal showed that he could till the soul and could touch that theophany doesn't touch it doesn't see taste smell here these senses that we have so God put man down there in order to to touch and to be mm-hmm he said but you just crossed yourself because you said a theophany beyond the curtain of time had senses are you listening that close sure but right before I said absences right are you talking about theology didn't have it just remember those beyond the curtain of time had come in there because of calvary right hold that point and as you walk through the Garden of Eden first as a theophany like the holy spirit is in here now walking in here it led the animal a lot it controlled everything all right go to number 10 let me read a few then we'll this is taken from Souls that are in prison now what made us different from other mammals that God put a soul upon us and read these with me now don't get so carnal or so great revelated that you think brother Dale he just says there that he put a soul on him well that's a great Revelation he didn't have a soul he just put a soul go on I didn't get where I'm at by arguing over them things that God put a soul upon us I'll just let him read to you in a little bit what he said now the other mammals don't have to wear clothes other animals has to wear clothes to hide his shame but us we're the only one that does because we have a soul we see God in the beginning knew what a man would be like all right number 11 Oneness 1962. he's talking about the man and the lamb and how it had to be because he was a human being with a soul and the Sheep has no soul see nothing has a soul but man God put he's an animal form that's true but he put a soul on him that's what made him differ from the animals he knowed right and wrong when his soul come on him but he remember when God created man in his own image and then he became a living Soul see he became that knowing right from wrong go ahead the resurrection of Lazarus preached in 1951. and then after he got all his creation made he said let us plural make man in our own plural on image now if God is unseen if the logos was in the form just mythically speaking drama in the form of a Halo then it's supernatural then he had to make a man in his own image so you didn't want to just leave him you know we're not to be just a spirit because God is not a spirit you know not to stay that way John 4 says that God is a spirit and he had to make a spirit man and he brought it down now what there's deity cannot be seen now he talking about man just as much as God deity is the supernatural then he brings it on down from a sacred hello to a little white light something that's more visible that's man you give him the rulership over the kingdom using the word deity you didn't have any problem using it did he go on to the next oh yeah that's paragraph 35 there's quicker than I am we're doing good says God put a soul in a man now the one guy said it should put a soul on a man so which one is it in a man or on a man or put a man beside the man or what a man this white cloud deity came down not in the animal in the man we're going to get to Blasphemous names when we ever do where brother Brown says that he breathe especially into Adam's nostrils eternal life if he put 126 and 27 into 2 7 then it had to be eternal life right now if they can see they can go out and play all they want to about the bones and the things and do what they want to go on questions and answers this is number 13. look Jesus come to manifest the father look in the beginning God made man and his own image is that right well what is God a spirit Saint John the fourth chapter Jesus speaking to the woman as well he said God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth is that right if God made man in his own image what kind of a man did he make then a spirit man that's what he made another man no man to tell the soil and he put the spirit of man in this animal man here and he become a living soul now that's the difference between a man and the animal the animal don't build automobiles he doesn't do things like that to help his living and so forth like that he's an animal dumb brute he hasn't got a soul he can't read or write he can't talk speak he's a dumb brute but a man in flesh like a brute but a man is in flesh like a brute but he's got a soul of God in him what makes him immortal watch him and he can invent look what he can do he's on almost on the equal with God because he's the son of God even in his Fallen estate he's wonderful look at him think about what he's saying go to the next room number 14. Lord Grace the animal can't give the human blood the animal can't do it because his life is a different life and an animal has a life but not a soul an animal is a living being written on a soul but God put soul on man so then my soul what is the soul the nature of the spirit it's wonderful right let's see how they got two more message you must be born again a soul good or bad death doesn't change it I had a lot of scripture wrote down here on this one that I want to comment on what is the soul what is a soul it's you you are a soul the part you evidently read Webster didn't he you are a soul the part inside of you and when you die and what shape that sold in that's the way it goes It goes to its destination you couldn't pull it up no matter how much you do for it that Soul's got to be changed here it'll be born again all right going to the next this is the Inside Man paragraph 119. the inside band preaching 53 12 12. would you do you ever think that inside of our body is another man did you know that that there's another man inside of our body and that's her spirit man did you ever think of that brother Ryan do you think of that brother Ryan to see what yes sir that how this is in here the Inside Man and this Inside Man if if it is of god it's the spirit of God is that right that's inside our being now my finger could not move without something making it move it works from an intelligence here and things like know how to think about it it all moves but that's what he's trying to explain what in your body he's a different person person yeah let's read this one and then we'll maybe read one or two more but we'll go ahead this is paragraph 279 in Hebrews chapter 2. now when man become into that body he had a control of all the fishes and the fowls and the beasts of the field then there was no man until the soil Genesis 2. he done made man made male and female but there was no man until the soul then God made man out of dust to the Earth he gave him a hand like a chimpanzee he'd give him a foot like a bear he made him on the image and this Earthly body is in the image of animal life all right wrote it on up but the difference between an animal and a man God put a soul in a man and he didn't put it in the animal because the soul that was in the man is that theophany Soul losing a man is that theophany what about it what do you think about it go ahead with 17. this is taken from adoption Paul said in 1960. it does not yet appear just exactly what kind of a body we'll have but we know we'll have a body like he is what did he ever have that theophany body yes sir when he died the Bible said he is a personal pronoun again not two or three people right he went to hell and preached to the souls in prison hallelujah how did he do it he had sense of feeling he had a sense of hearing he had sensitive speech he preached with that same kind of a body I saw those glorified ones in the other night he preached to the souls that were in hell that repented not in the long suffering in the days of Noah when he when he rose on the Easter it was not possible that the body should see corruption because David the prophet foreshaw not leave his soul in Hell neither will I suffer my Holy One see corruption or my flesh shall not rest and hold because he will not leave my flesh shall Rest In Hope because he will not leave my soul in Hell neither will he leave my my Holy One see one see corruption and in 72 hours and on 72 hour before corruption could set in that theophany that body that went and preached to the souls that were in prison that repented not in the long suffering in the days of Noah rose again and the Mortal put on immortality and he stood and ate and he told him that he told us that he was a man what about it did Jesus have that soul theophany what about it look at the next one taken from the entombment priest in 1957 420. here he goes where did he leave when he left the Bible said he ascended he went and preached to the souls that were in prison that repented not in the long suffering in the days of Noah his soul his Spirit his theophany of his own being went down his soul his Spirit his theophany of his own being that's pretty sure isn't it pretty sure of one thing your soul your spirit and your theophany is one being his soul was in Hell preaching to them he was in his theophany again just leave it there well let me show you the drawing bring up the drawing my brothers and then we'll show you a little addition you remember each time a little bit of addition pull it up brother you remember how we kept bringing out that all this back here is gonna have to be over here so whatever's here is going to be over there so over here we see that all of these attributes all these equal the nature of God which is the life of God the very nature of his being the soul his soul is his very nature of his being our soul is our very nature of our being souls in prison he said the nature of your soul is God if you're born again if not is of the devil so then we'll get into that to bring it on down but I want to talk about his soul now the next will be your soul that'll be the next Point next weekend your soul but think about it just think about the soul of an individual this body's not in the image of God it's in the image of the animals the spirit is just a mediator between the soul and the spirit I mean the body animals have that you know they have a spirit life me but they don't have a soul but a human being has a soul or really has not had us though that's what he is he is the soul God doesn't just have a soul he is a soul all of this has been him coming into being to reveal himself not him creating as we look at it and he's standing up looking and he slings off this one and there goes one person there goes another person remember the man that he's speaking about in the garden that led the animals and that man was put in flesh he fell he fell from that Holy estate that he was once dwelling in he didn't lose the eternal life out of his soul he couldn't do that that's right but I'd invite you to remember one point if you're going to talk about a beginning of a creation everyone except Jesus Christ Begins full grown the world Began full grown the animals Began full grown the man Began full grown but to make a way God had to change that and Jesus had to come in the wound of a mother to be the beginning of the creation of God amen you know that brother Brown said we're just a continuation of that creation what do you think about it come on musician what do you think about it is your God real can you tie together the theophany now and the soul to see that that's what it really is the soul is that really that theophany they were standing there and God sprinkled flesh over that the offney and there was the man we call Melchizedek but he didn't sprinkle flesh over a theophany in Jesus Christ he was the theophany he was the flesh he said a body that has created me that was a body God created that was not a just another human being because God had already stopped I'm saying something if you'll listen God had already stopped you remember in a quote we gave the prophet 336 Church age book where he said is he's the author of a finished physical creation see that was the last man he made you know mortal it could speak unto a body and step into it and go but that man couldn't die for you and I melchized it couldn't die he was not kin folks right he had to change the whole case and bring it to a man that could be kin folks to us and when it did then it brings it down to a life to where you and I can understand a little about salvation and see that that man that he created back there was one person Genesis 1 26 and 27 is one person well of God if that is the theophany and you have the soul of God then we might find out what the new birth is one day if God can sprinkle over a man and bring flesh he can take care of our old soul our old being of what we are and make it eternal a stand anybody have a need the Alders open what we got a number and she won't have that anymore it'll all be finished all right Lord Jesus because by your stripes she's healed and we believe it and we just ask you to reach down down touch her father and deliver her from those attacks that she has we thank you father in Jesus name amen I am fine foreign heard our brother Satan put upon him a problem with his foot he's been able to overcome that maybe a little crippled but that's no problem he's overcoming now Satan is working up the legs to make his knees to be people and things and we just ask you father to reach down and touch our brother and deliver him from these things truly Lord we know and have a feeling for her brother because of our knees hurting and oh Lord we just ask him that you'd reach down and touch our brother and that we lord would would believe you and say that by your stripes we are healed and we thank you for it in Jesus name just go confessing it brother go confession it say it say it and just keep on going believe it because we believe that anybody else see Satan is trying to hinder every one of us with old age part of life listen another day to the prophet I think a minute what the message it is but he said we can't ask God to take away this old age he said because that's part of the curse when he said we can ask him to take care of us while we're doing it while we're here you know if we can believe it we don't have to give into it all right you heard her brother Lord we just ask you to reach down and touch you now and delivering father we love you and we thank you thank you for touching our brother in Jesus name amen let's go thanking him for it Go thanking him for it and just saying thank you Lord you have a need to start thanking him right brother Ray he said he's been praying that the Lord said why don't you just thank me for it well just start thanking him because that's what the prophet says he said thank God for it say it just walk on walk on into it yeah it's Jesus Loves Me Do you love him amen you love him he's great isn't he to think of all that he has allowed you and I to see even if it's just mentally you know even if it's just mentally thank God for mental fines you know what you can only get spiritual about getting mental for her you don't get spiritual in the middle you get something mental and then you get it spiritually you place it in the correct order right amen just remember to pray one for another member Aaron Wednesday's sister Anna I'm a Gilman stupid a lot of times but I tell you when it comes to the physical things that we have and I tell Al I said Al I don't tell you all the problems that I have I don't tell you how I hurt all the time I said but you know what's I don't know whether we sing that little song here or not stomping yeah you know be like a little child and just sing and stomp him under our feet you know and say hey I know I'm getting older but by granny that doesn't mean I had to act real old right you know right be young exactly being old and acting old is two different things right I've seen people that were 16 that acted old and I've seen people it was 90 didn't even act old at all you know that's a good way to do it I mean anybody else before we go never pray one for another and I will go ahead and make a statement I've been aiming to make for quite a while here at the church we're going through some changes and some things it's doing you know in the church and and all getting it set and all like that because we don't know how much longer we're going to be here foreign we don't know what the next day is going to be and who worries it's no concern of mine it's no problem I don't have no fear you have fear Brother David going tomorrow I hurt I fear my neck hurting worse and I do anything it sure hurts so far out of me I don't have no problems with what the doctor says and what all of that says I just believe it and say by Stripes I'm Healed and no matter then whether it takes the doctor to help me why would brother Branham tell that man to go down there to that doctor he knows how to operate you can you can visualize in your mind that will brought around him knew that he couldn't have faith to get it and all that may be true but you know true there's a lot of Truth to just going to the doctor I remember years ago some brothers would quote there is a direct quote from Brother Brown where he said you do not have a right to come to the altar to be prayed for it to you go to the doctor first you need that quote it's there and that's almost as close as I can get it well now we don't get up here and say no now you go back till you go to the doctor because that's what the brother's doing back there in the 60s and early 70s get on back to you go to doctor now that's kind of silly we went by the house one day over to my family and they said where are you going I said we're going to the church and we're going to get to forget to pray for her because he's sick I said what are you gonna do we're going to take them to doctor but I said yes because we're going to go pray for him first because we're going to church well there's nothing wrong with going to the doctors the wrong is when you don't understand just tell that doctor said hey Doc you can't heal me of a toothache but I appreciate you thank you God gave us doctors when he knew that there wouldn't be enough enough belief into mankind to help us but when we depend upon the doctor now more than we do the God now we're going wrong just say bias drops I'm Healed and just walk home you know you might walk yourself into it true you might come right into it amen but just remember those things and and pray that the Lord would bless us as we go through kind of a little change and hear of what we're doing because we're changing over the building part and doing it just that and getting everything in order to where I don't want any trouble when I'm planning on being around here either for the change or being around here about 20 more years that just make me about 95 4. so I'm planning on being around here at least 20 more years so we're trying to get everything set in order to work in the handle 20 years from now you don't have to come down to the nursing home and ask me what you want done I don't make a lot of people do and you know what I mean we just get where they can't do nothing and just you know and you'll have it all set in order we're doing that and also I've been aiming to make this announcement weight has always been the assistant pastor of course the other brothers accounting assistant pastors also because of their helps and their doing but as of today I'm putting him into the position to where he is the junior pastor but I am still the senior pastor and when I'm out he's in charge all right because that's that's what's given you know that's the way I think it ought to be done and everything because I am the one that can do those things the pastor has the full sway of those authorities so I can do it now when I'm not here anymore you can vote all you want to but you're gonna have to put up with him until I get out of here so that'd be nice all right think on these things father we're not trying to become what could it be anything just being truthful Lord we're just putting everything into the bases that we can make sure that this church operates even though if you decided to take us off the scene that there would be no problem there wouldn't be no trouble wouldn't be no heartaches that the church would operate and just go right on because we believe in in you Lord and we thank you and we love you and we thank you we're not making any preparations we should have made preparations a long time ago Lord but we just being human we just roll along and wait you just have your way got each one take care of everybody on the way home bless each and every one in Jesus name amen you dismissed he's an easy real good ready each of them each of them
