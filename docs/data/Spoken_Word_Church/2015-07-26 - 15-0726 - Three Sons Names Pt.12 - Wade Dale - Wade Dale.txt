========================================

Parker will be reading that again we won't be reading there all right let's turn to Matthew chapter 16 everything want to thank for the ball he did a real good job link you guys did a good job with sons to where did you put the microphone um not there we're never sexy parlor excuse moi ok alrighty then let's go to Matthew 16 let's read verse let's start with verse 12 I told you we were going to do this told you we're going to do this last week and and I hope you I hope we understand now that the Son of God is a spirit god the holy go alright if I got them the Holy Ghost is the son of God that's the spirit they must worship Him in spirit and in truth Jesus said but we're going to bring it down to this and then we're going to kind of expand a little now look why what's the difference in milk is a bit we talked about it before but let's go back what's the difference in the mail Cassidy and Jesus Christ what's the difference there's one key difference thumbs up the whole thing that's correct the Melchizedek was not a he was up man and he wasn't a son of he was the son of god that took on a human form not our brother he could not be our kinsman sure the kids mom was inside there but he was showing that he was going to come well brother Brown said son a man meets the man Abraham are inside as a as a example that wasn't the Son of Man right so that man couldn't do Abraham any good he can only promise I tell Abraham you're my you're my son and you're you know I'll not withhold anything from from Abraham enough i'm going to give you this promise and i'm going to visit you in common life but he couldn't save Abraham a man all right he could give him a promise all right that the son of man was coming okay but that was not a son of anybody melchizedek that flash that was standing in front of Abraham was the son of nobody so he could be a son he was a man he was what god that took on the form of a man but not God it took on the form of a baby man all right we have to be baby Potter that's right remember the Bible says he has no father no mother so he couldn't be what son he was just a man and I don't mean just he was Almighty God but that was just a human body that he clipped together stepped into actually could not do anything but tell Abraham what was going to happen because remember he said I'll visit you at the time of life what do you do Melchizedek didn't come in visiting you got it metal Cassidy didn't walk into 10 and make them change all right but the god inside of it did the son of god the holy ghost came down and anointed Abraham and Sarah's body and said okay this is what I'm going to do to you to produce the Sun mill Cassidy didn't do it now what when Jesus come he said kept saying I the Son of Man I'm gonna do I you and that's okay I don't care for preachers didn't do all this I me me me stuff I don't care a thing about people like that I did this and I did that not even it's an idea that I didn't it don't like that but now this guy could say that because he was the man he's the man that did all right so he can say hi cuz we're gonna read it right here it says whom do men say hi the son of man am all right person so what is it now this Melchizedek which was the one he was a prince he was a king son of man so man was a son of man down here all right we'll get into some of that just a little bit cuz brother Brown said son of God was a God you know he was one of the Creator we talked about all that the son of mana is all that in one human flesh body but that human flesh body started as two cells hey and sperm or German creation put them together to make this all right you don't make this there's a revelation if you'll get it this doesn't change at all there's no change in the Son of God he don't need Redemption he didn't he didn't need to get on the cross he's pure perfect eternal never had a bad day everything was just wonderful man but when we did what we did he had to come in the form of flesh and be born through a wound and grew up just like me in you that way this this is our kinsman ok we're going to read we're reading that's the man but watch this because most people don't get this but I'll prove it to you about what the property God said when Jesus came into the coast of Syria Philip I he asked his disciple till I told the preacher this one time I said look Peter never answered that question he said when he made peace and yet Peter answered the question I said let's read it he said I'll never saying like that one whom do men say that I the Son of Man a.m. now remember this is matthew 16 this is about it's not at the end of his ministry is County in the middle so people are already talking about him and and you know they're taking him a little strange and a lot of things went on but he hasn't went to Mount Transfiguration so he's kind of in the middle of ministry so whom do men say and they said so some of them were talking not they I mean they see if it says and they said okay that's some of the de something that wasn't one person that was today they said they said some say they are John the Baptist boy re carnate reincarnate John the better some say Elijah no he had all the characteristics of a logical level disappeared blind and others Jeremiah are one of the Prophet he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am and Peter Simon Peter Hanson said thou art the Christ this is my wife mortal men this is not Christ full amount of mistake this is Christ full manifestation right this was the Christ the Creator all right he said blessed are their salad bar gonna know now are the Christ the Son of the Living God that's the answer he gave he'd give this entry and then you never say show me where he's at it he said thou art the Christ the Son of living done all right now we know this is the Lord Jesus Christ we know but look this is another manifestation or brother branham one to put it in three dispensation if we didn't need it we didn't need a broke down so we know who he is where he's at and what he's doing all right jesus said unto them blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah son junk we're flesh and blood and not revealed in you but my father which is in heaven which was what a revelation of the Son of God was watching and ice and aleve that thou art Peter and upon this rock my brother have explained that he said remember that's not peter catholic church says peter all right the denominational world says it's what hmm Jesus that's not a man revelation it's not till now Jesus was the son of man right Jesus was some and everybody getting that he's with the Son of Man upon this rock upon this revelation I'll build my church now what he build the church on this or this he built his church brother Brown City da trut he died so man heroes son of god and he was son of god through seven church ages they got the revelation of the holy ghost in the believer right so that's what Peter answered but jesus said okay that's all right that's what I'm going to build my church on I'm gonna build my church on this revelation because remember they didn't have a revelation of this once Jesus left once Jesus left it was a son of God dispensation right but now in the end time everything that they saw that ministry had to come back the son of man remember when I told you brother Brown said they said oh you're the son of man he said no I'm a son of man he didn't say I'm son of god they're all through the Ministry says I'm a son of God you and all her well we are all sons and daughters of God but watch him identify yourself in the Intel he didn't say on son of God revealing the Sun man he said I'm a son of man so there was God him a flash revealing the son of man v son of man what the one man Jesus Christ right so you put all the honor that's what I mean brother brown and put all the honor of Jesus Christ he never stood up sure you have to tell illustrations of what happened in your life I you know but it's not actual I always say we're going through the Philippine lever I thought Jim was going with no man the Lord is going to filter the door is taking me to fill thing Lord stadium in Jamaica I hardly ever i'll say i'm going that's a no we're going that's what we'll do when we said no lord woman ok and i'll give you the keys of the kingdom all right of what so the gods a rule of heaven the man ruber right so he's telling him around here I'll give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou bind on earth so now what's he going to say he's going to say look I don't go to the Son of God revelation is going to come inside of you and me being inside of you will read it latex Sunday for Jesus talked about the Son of Man the Son of Man the Sun man coming back alright whatever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven and then he charged his a sample they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ all right now let's go to let's go over one more Matthew 17 he's still picking this up this is Mount Transfiguration come after six days so he's continued on and behold there appeared unto Moses of the lines talking with it then answered Peter and sending Jesus Lord is good for us to be here now we'll make three cover dr. see if you have a son of God I mean son of man revelation he didn't knew that man with was the man but now he wants to build three Tabernacles one for you one for Moses and one for Elijah he said this is my beloved son and my well please hear you him now we know what that is that's the adoption right now let me ask you a question do you notice on a gun or do you dump some men who needs adopted son of God doesn't need anything remember anything make your list and put one thing this man's perfect eternal this man never felt that man never felt Jesus become into a fallen condition to get us they did fall through the fill to get back up all right that's why the Son of God revelation had to come in the church ages because they remember programs and god above us in the new test and the Old Testament God with us now I'm got in it okay but the revelation sure they were all like even as eco shut a man prophesied but there's a revelation that God is now where he's always wanted to be Wow why not the first church age then have all the work what out second surgery then hello Lord he was the word that three-and-a-half-year mention that son of man ministry was the word make manifest know Creed no three gods no eternal hell jesus never preached any left all right but he got he rode in and he knew that that's why did that even the ones that in the fourth church age that just says we believe in Jesus well there's like john three sixteen forgot so loved the world that He gave His only what begotten Son he was the only be God why'd he come from father this way he was a sign all right don't Lee begotten of the Father what and if you believe on him you shall be saved but if they would save anybody's flesh never saved no man's flesh this man didn't take a body change this man took the body chain these people down to the church age is in the Son of God revelation is what your own nature is cleaned out God comes in and you are a Christian your mind is changed and you have the mind of Christ and you're supposed to do what the Bible says great exploits but they come to the age that they supposed to die and they die why because there was no revelation that that flesh can be changed that's why you hear the song some glorious day right up in heaven you know I'll fly away you know when I die and all these things everybody's looking forward because of Revelation was under God may have a son remember a legend they still he's here that's my brother my brother I'm had to count say look he's here he's not something you go to look when he lifted up her eyes I saw no man say Jesus no Liesl a no he'll share his glory with nobody okay all right and they came down from the mountain Jesus charging saying tell the vision what this was a vision what was the division of two things happened on Mount of Transfiguration one vision was a change of the body right transfigured okay adoption and Moses and Elijah what brother Brown say spoke of the coming of the Lord all right the resurrection when the Lord comes to go resurrect so you have to put that in there Moses and Elijah well they're so you're looking at what tell the vision of no ma'am what's the vision the visions at the end time because where's Moses and Elijah going to peer in the end time that's the son of that's heading into the son of David dispensation because most of the life has got to be on the scene before they take Israel into the son of David dispensation you got that so here's Jesus Son of man coming up he says look they've told me all the way now to the to the Millennial most in Elijah there stands to two prophets not the people but the spirit there stands the two prophets that are going to go it's going to take him from this dispensation over into the Sunday to show you they told him all the way through said they told me no way that they told him what was going on tell the DS another level because look this man has limitations this man does not this man has limitation he had his sleep he was hungry sure there was there was many supernatural things that happen in his body I don't know how in the world he went 40 days and 40 nights with no water her food but he didn't that's what the Bible said so his body had to overtake Godhead overtake his body somewhere and sustain him for that 40 days but remember he still looked like he was 50 something years old so that's not the full manifestation of this man because remember that man that walked in the cool of the day with Adam and Eve was a young man this man dman be theophany King Jesus King Jesus Christ in Theogony form alright but when he comes down to here and comes into this domain fate indeed the pressure pounds on this thing but that's what that's what went in the ground and he raised a son of God sure but he was in flesh but what flash with the end he was in a change flesh of glorified condition all right Mike's hotel the vision to no man until the Son of Man be risen again again from the dead now jesus knows one thing for sure now that he's going to die right here but I say that license come already and they knew him not what hello we know this is talking about brother brown that my gun down you ever heard that believe I preached it here before cup of time jesus answered said Elias what the spirit of Elijah truly shall first come and restore all things have John the Baptist did not restore all things right so he wasn't talking but now watch him watch what's God hide yourself in the scripture though he comes right down and says but I am believing the license come over here and they're like oh my lord but this is two comings of live intro this is the logic come in number three I mean number three and number four then I got that hmm right a lot truly shop first come and restore all things John the Baptist introduced the first coming of Jesus but he did not restore the kingdom right Jesus were still brought the kingdom brother branham restored what's he doing what's this right here this says right here to me and tie up all loose in see that and tight i'm not changing the word and tie up all loose ends that's what brother Brown said he came to do right the top all beliefs in so that allows truly shall come and restore all things what seven seals church ages everything brother branham problem that Ministry of a brother branham restored all things what back to who the son of man it was standing there so Jesus is saying watch this hole watch this whole part right here Jesus tears television to no man he's coming this this on television the novela until the Son of Man be risen again from the dead again so it means 2 times right again he's going to die one time but remember brother Graham said they crucify him again but any end time he's going to be what resurrected from what dead denominations and creeds who's going to do it while then say described to the last must first come they know Elijah member priesthood long time ago they know Elijah has got to come before Jesus come they know that that's why they said that cup and that ere they opened the door and they say Elijah if you don't come then shut the door say until next year but one day one day I man is coming but Moses is coming winning they just missed that part but that spirit of Elijah will come to Israel and nine hundred forty-four thousand will then know that the massage coming but what they'll telomeres remember remember you go back then to go to go back into Ezekiel Jeremiah where it says you missed it he didn't come for you he's already come but don't worry we're here to take you out of here 144,000 are going to what start crying they know that they missed it what they do they miss the coming of the Son of Man they missed that coming but they're going to get what revelation the Son of God right so they're going out different that we're going up we're going out when the body change bride of Jesus Christ lease on a man going up because it says the Son of Man be risen again from the dead alright so here we are that whole thing look but I saying you did Elijah has come already who going about it and they knew him not he told him for someone a prelude but have done into him whatsoever they listed so in other words they did exactly what the word said is going to do rejecting all right likewise y'all although the son of man suffer a who them same people that persecuted John with the same one okay then the disciples understood these folks faith in them of what John the badness so they didn't say no more about it in Scripture nowhere except Peter says I have a more sure word of prophecy now because that man that was standing there telling us what was going on is now inside him right which was the son of God revelation so the Son of man has to be risen again who's going raising from the dead the Elijah they're looking for the Elijah we're looking for it's going to do it here the Elijah they're looking for it's not going to physically raised Jesus up but it's going to raise in a revelation to where the 144,000 is going to come in and they're going to go up and around right so there's your whole to me that's brother Adams ministry John the Baptist minister Jesus's ministry and the two witnesses right there in just a few scriptures boy you come by scripture being full building just enough just about three or four little purses that will fulfill every bit of it everyone it will fulfil every bit Jesus is on a mountain statute perfect man Jesus is on a mountain he gets adopted up here right everything is exactly the way it's supposed to be but likewise shall also the son of man suffered them now we know one thing's for sure that Jesus when he come down off of that mountain he really hammered on those Pharisees and Sadducees he really let him have it after them you keep reading will read it next honey look we're right here will will stop it i won't get into something else about the son of man but reading the bible just look up the word son of man and the new testament and see how many times you said the Son of man has power why did the Son of Man have power to forgive sin but let me let me hear yourself let me throw you a curveball he said you can speak against the son of man that'll be forgiving you right but if you speak against one it's coming he said it'll never be forgiving you here or anywhere else you find out what the difference for those normal confines he says son is here to forgive sad power but he said you've been against on mandy's it'll be forgiven he said if you don't speak against the one to come stop daddy about
