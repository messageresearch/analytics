[0:00] we won't cover it today
[0:02] but made you read it anyway didn't I
[0:04] yeah that's let's go back to Malachi
[0:08] 4 I used to have a
[0:11] u in college I had a u history professor
[0:15] at keemont he he said well we might have
[0:18] a pop quiz and we might not have a
[0:22] popiz big thing was he'd go over when
[0:25] the bell rang at 8:00 he'd go over and
[0:26] shut the door and he'd either say number
[0:29] one one and start with the quiz or he'd
[0:32] start in his dissertation about what we
[0:34] were talking about in history so that
[0:36] may be what I'm going to
[0:39] do tell you to read Revelation 5 and
[0:42] then not say anything for about 3 weeks
[0:44] and then say what's a first chap what
[0:46] the first verse
[0:48] say let's turn to Malachi 4 I really
[0:52] want to get this in our head because I
[0:54] do not think
[0:56] that most
[0:58] people realize how important it is that
[1:02] we see that the prophet came to do two
[1:05] things and he came
[1:09] to restore
[1:11] back the faith of the
[1:13] fathers and then bring his message now
[1:16] we'll bring some quotes maybe next
[1:18] Sunday but I wanted to get by with this
[1:20] go through this verse just one more time
[1:24] last Sunday all right Malachi
[1:26] 4 verse 5 behold I will send you Elijah
[1:29] the proph before the coming of the great
[1:31] and Dreadful day of the Lord and he
[1:32] shall turn the heart of the fathers to
[1:34] the children now that was who John the
[1:38] Baptist he took the
[1:41] old fathers of the Old Testament and
[1:44] brought them to the New
[1:47] Testament
[1:49] Pentecostal babies babes in Christ and
[1:52] you say well what about the 120 upper
[1:54] room they were still babes in Christ
[1:58] because they had never been born again
[1:59] before but when they were born again
[2:01] they came up to a level like we were
[2:03] talking about of maturity because the
[2:06] word himself had spoke to them and
[2:09] planted that word in their heart and the
[2:10] Bible said they took the word and held
[2:12] it so as they held it they got more than
[2:15] the 3,000
[2:17] downstairs but John came to introduce
[2:19] the Messiah to bridge that gap between
[2:22] the Old Testament and the New Testament
[2:25] all right now and the Heart of the
[2:28] children to the fathers so we come up
[2:32] through John's time John Dies Jesus
[2:35] comes on the scene Jesus dies Jesus
[2:39] resurrects Jesus sends back his Spirit
[2:42] on the day of Pentecost baptized in 120
[2:45] and then baptizing 3000 with the Holy
[2:47] Ghost and beginning as we were talking
[2:52] before in I'm going to slow
[2:55] down in Revelation 3 the beginning of
[2:59] the the creation of God all right now
[3:03] and I'm going to make a statement today
[3:05] that probably you'll never hear before
[3:08] but you're going to hear it today and I
[3:09] truly believe
[3:13] it man has never been turned back as far
[3:16] as they have in this end time that's
[3:18] right okay Paul Peter even though they
[3:23] walked down the street and people just
[3:25] looked at them and was in the shadow of
[3:28] the Believers and they were healed that
[3:31] was the power of that lion age l i o n
[3:35] not lion lion age Lion of the tribe of
[3:38] Judah was in forced he was in those
[3:41] people but there was a part of them
[3:45] there was a part of God that they didn't
[3:48] have even though they were we say fully
[3:52] matured
[3:54] people they
[3:57] still only got this
[4:04] Revelation
[4:06] okay that to soak in they only got the
[4:09] Revelation that God came to
[4:12] die it was the Holy Ghost that came on
[4:15] the day of Pentecost that baptized them
[4:17] and made their soul just as Eternal as
[4:20] God is but they continued to
[4:24] die everybody got
[4:27] that this continued through
[4:30] seven seven Church
[4:33] ages they understood who Jesus was but
[4:36] they didn't have the revelation of who
[4:38] they are that's
[4:40] what they understood to a degree that
[4:43] Jesus was God but now the son of man
[4:46] which sure they knew that that was God
[4:48] in human flesh that's what Peter said
[4:50] but inside their s they didn't have the
[4:53] word revealed to them what we're fixing
[4:55] to go into now had never been revealed
[4:58] to these people right because Jesus
[5:01] preached those six
[5:02] seals and even when he
[5:05] resurrected they said oh you're going to
[5:07] restore Jerusalem that's right you're
[5:09] going to rebuild the Temple you're going
[5:10] to do this they were talking still even
[5:13] natural things that's right all right so
[5:16] they got this Revelation that God came
[5:19] down in human flesh and died for their
[5:24] sins Paul says we don't see all things
[5:26] but we see Jesus sure he was the son of
[5:31] man but they didn't get the revelation
[5:34] of the son of man spirit and
[5:37] flesh there was a question in their mind
[5:40] and when there's a
[5:41] question that always causes
[5:45] death because that's the big question
[5:49] that's the last question of
[5:51] man how can we do away with death man
[5:56] has through 2,000 years tried through
[6:01] politics and through science to make us
[6:04] live better but they know we still dying
[6:07] remember brother brandham he said told
[6:09] the doctor he said doc he said when I
[6:11] was young I could eat and get stronger
[6:14] said but now I eat the same and better
[6:16] and I'm dying well that's the sin curse
[6:20] that's the curse that's put on every
[6:22] man but there's one man defeated
[6:26] death that was God in human flesh
[6:30] okay
[6:34] now up until
[6:38] 1963 this was not a
[6:42] revelation to anybody the way it's
[6:45] supposed to be you understand what I'm
[6:46] saying the way it's supposed to be yes
[6:49] all right this was revealed the Bible
[6:52] seven Church ages Revelations 1 through3
[6:55] the spirit coming and doing the work
[6:57] like daddy's been talking about the the
[6:59] Angels The Messengers coming to deliver
[7:02] a message all
[7:04] right but now and that's what this is
[7:08] right here and the Heart of the children
[7:10] to the fathers brother Brown didn't
[7:12] restore everybody saying son of man son
[7:14] of man son of man son of man brother
[7:16] brandham only
[7:18] restored before
[7:20] 1963 this
[7:24] Revelation but in this
[7:28] revelation
[7:31] the flesh
[7:34] dies sin curs is still
[7:38] here but when this man Rose and this
[7:41] spirit and flesh said I said all power
[7:44] in heaven and earth been given unto
[7:48] me see let's be real let's just talk
[7:51] real I know it's on the internet and I
[7:53] don't care if anybody he Jesus was dying
[7:56] in human flesh right he did not have
[8:00] control over
[8:02] death in his human body that's right
[8:05] right everybody understand that because
[8:07] remember what they say you man not more
[8:09] 50 he was not but 30 right he never made
[8:12] it to
[8:13] 50 so his physical body the blood
[8:17] cells were dying the skin cells when he
[8:20] would
[8:22] wash he was human like me and you he
[8:25] cried he had to eat he of course
[8:27] honestly he did have control over this
[8:29] flesh more than
[8:31] most because he was God in human flesh
[8:33] not a sinless not a sinful
[8:36] body but when that body broke into this
[8:39] domain this first three
[8:43] dimensions he was under Satan's
[8:47] domain
[8:49] right remember we D read scripture about
[8:52] the on being you got to wait until you
[8:53] know he was made a little lower than the
[8:55] What Angels if he was made a little
[8:57] lower than the Angels then what he
[8:58] brought on death on his body so he could
[9:01] what take on death come back up and then
[9:04] he could say all power in
[9:08] Heaven and
[9:11] Earth has been given unto me he only had
[9:14] power over Heaven he did not have power
[9:18] over
[9:19] Earth you say he was God he limited
[9:22] himself he had to give us an
[9:25] example all right he did not have power
[9:28] over this right here or he would have
[9:30] not come off of that mountain and curse
[9:32] that fig tree because the he was hungry
[9:35] the prophet said and the Fig Tree had
[9:37] not brought forth it fruit yet so he
[9:39] cursed it why the prophet said he was
[9:42] hungry he slept through a storm so he
[9:45] did not have total control he could not
[9:48] say all
[9:50] power until what this man had
[9:53] resurrected and these two had become one
[9:56] where you could not separate them when
[9:58] he was on Earth Earth you could separate
[10:01] him the flesh man right brother B said
[10:04] he was
[10:05] human all right
[10:08] mortal now when you bring the two
[10:10] together what do the Bible say life and
[10:13] immortality has been brought to light
[10:16] through the gospel and only one man has
[10:17] reached it and that was
[10:21] Jesus the flesh was what was limited
[10:23] exactly what he had inside of him was
[10:27] not just like you and I right just like
[10:31] you and I that's we have the Holy Ghost
[10:34] by measure but that measure is the same
[10:36] elements that he had when he was walking
[10:38] on the shes of Galilee heal sick rais
[10:40] the dead that's what happened right here
[10:43] that Spirit could work
[10:45] out okay what I'm looking at
[10:49] today you take this thing right here
[10:52] this is a what
[10:55] microphone now you know it's a
[10:56] microphone I know it's a microphone and
[10:59] we know what it's used
[11:00] for but unless I say anything it's still
[11:03] a microphone that's
[11:11] right we can stand here for 100 years
[11:13] it's still a microphone that's right
[11:15] it's still on and connected that's right
[11:18] but unless someone says something
[11:19] through it it's just a piece of material
[11:22] that's
[11:23] right that's what God did he took a
[11:25] piece of material called flesh and made
[11:28] and spoke through it and that's what he
[11:30] did with this end time Prophet people
[11:32] just can't get it straight and keep the
[11:33] two separated because he was born in sin
[11:35] this man was
[11:37] not all
[11:39] right now so we we see that brother
[11:43] brandham when he started in his early
[11:46] Ministry he had a Healing Ministry just
[11:48] like we we talked here but as he
[11:51] progresses through his
[11:53] ministry he sees that he comes to a
[11:57] point he thinks he's preached at all
[12:02] 1961 spoken words of Original Seed
[12:05] brother Bram said the pure un
[12:06] adulterated words been sewn down in the
[12:08] earth Lord I've got a out on the limb I
[12:10] don't know what to do in other words
[12:12] what's he saying we're still
[12:15] dying we're still dying I'm still
[12:18] putting people in the ground why is my
[12:20] message not having the effect it should
[12:24] on the
[12:25] people if he was the seventh angel
[12:28] messenger which was supposed to do
[12:32] this God showed him he had at least come
[12:35] back to the faith of the fathers when he
[12:36] went across the curtain of time and said
[12:39] did Paul make it he said the angel said
[12:41] what yes Paul made it brother BR said
[12:43] well I will make it too because I preach
[12:45] what Paul preached now that identified
[12:48] where that man was he had preached the
[12:51] word to the faith of the fathers pure
[12:53] and unadulterated just like Paul because
[12:55] remember what did the people say we're
[12:57] resting on that right now this is where
[13:01] it's going to get a little ugly those
[13:04] people were
[13:05] dead humanly that's right that's right
[13:08] we're resting on that right they weren't
[13:12] resting on this that's
[13:14] right they were resting on this
[13:17] right resting on that brother brandham
[13:20] preached a message to them they got the
[13:22] Holy Ghost in their soul they died human
[13:26] death and went across a curtain of time
[13:28] just as Eternal as God is no shame for
[13:31] the people but they were resting on this
[13:35] ministry right here so brother Bram
[13:37] comes
[13:38] back okay say he went there and come
[13:41] back whatever you want to say but he
[13:42] comes back into this Dimension and then
[13:44] he goes 1961 he says he said Lord
[13:46] there's something there's a problem
[13:48] somewhere now what did the prophet what
[13:50] did the prophet say through the prophet
[13:52] as of yet Malachi 4 has not been made
[13:54] manifest so brother randam comes in the
[13:56] church ages and what does he say
[14:00] in the L the see and church age now this
[14:02] messenger of Malachi 4 see if it wasn't
[14:04] for Revelations 10:7 Mal four would just
[14:08] put you in this category here I don't
[14:11] like putting people in categories but we
[14:12] got to put them in categories to show
[14:14] where we're at now that's right okay
[14:16] everyone that is dead from this day back
[14:20] think of all brother Tatum F Tatum all
[14:22] the ones just died Sister Hazel they
[14:25] died under this ministry right
[14:27] here see the people in the message are
[14:29] holling son of man son of man son they
[14:31] don't even know what they're talking
[14:32] about if and I'm saying all of us cuz if
[14:36] all of us knew what we talking
[14:38] about right that's right that's what
[14:41] that brings that's right all power in
[14:43] Heaven and Earth that's what I was
[14:44] preaching the other night all power in
[14:46] that's a powerful statement that's all
[14:47] power in heaven and earth been given
[14:49] unto
[14:50] me
[14:52] personal and if we were in him at that
[14:55] time which we were right in eternal life
[14:59] in representation we were in that man
[15:02] standing there in Matthew whatever it is
[15:06] 20 something says all power in heaven
[15:08] and earth been given unto
[15:10] me problem was there wasn't enough
[15:13] belief or enough word down through the
[15:15] ages to get them from here to
[15:18] here so in this the Son of God Ministry
[15:22] is still going on today the Son of God
[15:25] ministry will
[15:27] not
[15:30] retire cuz they'll never go away it'll
[15:33] not it'll retire at the white Throne
[15:36] judgment cuz this son of God see they'll
[15:39] never get son of man Ministry at the
[15:41] white Throne judgment they'll be given
[15:43] eternal life what what Spirit God will
[15:46] put his Spirit into that person and that
[15:49] person will become Eternal all
[15:51] right this ministry right here is a
[15:54] person standing on Earth that says this
[15:59] but didn't go through
[16:01] death everybody's got brother rown come
[16:03] to bring the son of man Ministry sure he
[16:05] did
[16:10] absolutely but that was
[16:13] 196 through
[16:16] whenever that be
[16:18] understand he started preaching the son
[16:20] of man Ministry really when the seals
[16:22] broke 1963 right the son of man the Lord
[16:25] Jesus Christ he said I'm not a he he
[16:28] said I'm not the son of man a son of man
[16:29] revealing what the son of man cuz the
[16:31] son of man that's why brother bam had to
[16:33] go and time Malachi 4 in Revelation 107
[16:36] in this
[16:38] quote in the days of the voice of the
[16:40] seventh angel when he begins to sound
[16:42] the mystery there's one my there's only
[16:44] one mystery left change of the body how
[16:47] to get out of here without dying that's
[16:49] the only mystery left every other
[16:52] mystery's been made known seals have
[16:54] been
[16:56] broke right right right we in this
[17:00] room at least by head
[17:03] knowledge know more than anybody down
[17:05] through those ages including the Apostle
[17:07] Paul that's
[17:09] right cuz we have this ministry here
[17:13] available you hear what I'm saying I
[17:15] want you to listen to my words it's
[17:17] available that's right it may not be
[17:20] quickened in your life yet but it's
[17:24] available up until 1963 it was not
[17:27] available
[17:30] even up until
[17:32] now to some it's not available that's
[17:35] right cuz they're under this right here
[17:37] shouting about this right here which is
[17:40] okay but this person right here will
[17:43] take a change without
[17:46] death when they get the true revelation
[17:49] of the son of man because the son of man
[17:52] said all power in Heaven and Earth has
[17:55] been given unto me and he never died
[17:58] again
[17:59] his body became Eternal and that's what
[18:02] we're looking at on this
[18:04] side now so brother BR says now this
[18:06] messenger of Malachi 4 Revelation 10:7
[18:09] is going to do two things one according
[18:11] to Malachi 4 turn the hearts of the
[18:13] children to the
[18:16] fathers that's all your church ages like
[18:19] I said even up until
[18:21] now we're still under the Son of God
[18:24] Ministry when when someone goes to the
[18:26] Altar and gets born again they believe
[18:29] in the Son of God the spirit God that
[18:31] brought the word to their life indwelled
[18:34] their
[18:36] soul right
[18:39] right but this is not made known at that
[18:42] time
[18:43] right this is a development because in
[18:46] Revelation 10 1-7 it's a development
[18:48] right Christ has to come
[18:51] down and speak to you right did he came
[18:54] down in 63 and spoke to brother randam
[18:56] that's fine that's what we can take this
[18:58] as a
[19:00] foundation okay and that's what we're
[19:02] heading into we're heading into the
[19:04] foundation to get us to get the book
[19:07] open the book was
[19:10] closed did you read Revelations 5 yep
[19:13] the book was
[19:16] closed brother Brown said what man had
[19:18] known before had only been
[19:21] known of a closed book right sure sure
[19:25] sure the book is open phys
[19:28] open man has preached the word of God
[19:31] for 2,000
[19:33] years but you can read this book and it
[19:35] be open and read it 100 times and it
[19:37] still be closed in your mind and your
[19:39] heart all
[19:41] right so now one more time to make us to
[19:44] be slow because this is the steps that
[19:46] we go
[19:49] through sister Johnny this is the steps
[19:51] that we go through the Journey okay
[19:53] because when you're born again
[19:54] justification sanctification baptism the
[19:56] Holy Ghost puts you in the body
[20:00] and he the Son of God carries you up
[20:03] through justification sanctification
[20:04] baptism Holy Ghost up that statue of a
[20:06] perfect man that's right okay but the
[20:09] son of man is a headstone CU remember it
[20:11] was rejected it wasn't here it wasn't it
[20:14] wasn't at the time to the believer we
[20:16] know Jesus was The Headstone right
[20:19] excuse me but to the believer we're
[20:21] still living under the and we are
[20:24] too you and I are still living right
[20:26] today under this ministry right
[20:29] here okay now this is being revealed yes
[20:35] this is being revealed to us that's
[20:36] right but that's got to be left up to
[20:38] you that's right individual Affair all
[20:41] the way through that's right from baby
[20:44] from baby baby born again to fully
[20:48] matured born again that's right
[20:50] individual Affair everybody has a
[20:53] different way of getting there amen
[20:55] there's one New York but there's several
[20:57] ways to get there there and I'm glad
[20:59] sister Johnny coming back this
[21:03] way and we didn't have to go up there
[21:05] and get
[21:06] her never been in New York that's the
[21:08] way I want to be when I get in the
[21:10] Millennium I want to say I've never been
[21:11] in New
[21:15] York maybe we travel like I thought
[21:17] maybe I'll just thought over the top of
[21:19] New York and going
[21:21] by at least I thought of New York
[21:24] anyway nothing against New York but I
[21:26] like it down here all right Revelation
[21:29] 10:7 is going to do two things one
[21:30] according to Malachi 4 turn the hearts
[21:31] of the children to the fathers one two
[21:35] he will reveal the mysteries of the
[21:36] seven thund in Revelations 10 which are
[21:39] the revelations contained in the Seven
[21:40] Seals it will be these divinely revealed
[21:43] mystery truth that literally remember we
[21:46] preached on this before literally means
[21:48] fig doesn't mean that it's a an allegory
[21:51] or a type literal means that I'm
[21:54] literally standing here right Josh could
[21:57] be standing here in my place as a type
[21:59] of me but literally means I'm literally
[22:02] standing right here he said literally
[22:04] turn the hearts of the children to the
[22:06] Pentecostal fathers exactly so not the
[22:08] Pentecostal fathers back then we're
[22:11] talking about the real deal right so now
[22:15] does anybody have any questions there
[22:16] was two parts the message of Jesus
[22:19] Christ when he come a three and A2 year
[22:21] message he preached the message of the
[22:23] son of
[22:25] man nobody understood it he preached the
[22:28] pure word he was the pure word
[22:32] right Son of God Ministry was what when
[22:35] Jesus left what came back the spirit of
[22:38] God came back in the form of the Holy
[22:41] Ghost in the heart of
[22:43] Believers to help them understand this
[22:45] word amen all right pretty simple cuz
[22:48] that's what I hope that's what it's do
[22:49] to you
[22:51] now but this message right here was
[22:54] something that had never been taught by
[22:56] human being before
[22:59] right until that Mighty angel came down
[23:02] Christ cuz he's the one that delivered
[23:04] it the first
[23:06] time cuz remember we read in Matthew 17
[23:09] about what Jesus said until us tell this
[23:13] Vision what did they see they saw Jesus
[23:17] on a mountain glorified right now we
[23:22] know he came out of that glorification
[23:23] and died at Calvary he had to because he
[23:25] was the what the lamb right
[23:28] but he was glorified the prophet said
[23:30] and we were there with him on that
[23:33] mountain Amen in spirit form not our
[23:36] spirit but in the holy spirit that was
[23:38] in that man we were on that mount
[23:40] Transfiguration that's right we got to
[23:42] believe that everything happened to him
[23:44] happened to us right right all
[23:48] right tell this Vision to no man until
[23:51] the son of man be
[23:54] risen
[23:56] again out of what brother Brown done out
[23:58] of dead Creeds and
[24:01] denomination Jesus is not going to have
[24:03] to come and die again that's right
[24:05] physically that's right he died
[24:06] physically that was the son of man one
[24:08] time dying right he said so the son of
[24:10] man be risen again that's right that's
[24:12] only promised in the end time right
[24:16] now now let me make it a little bit
[24:18] stronger brother brandham comes to the
[24:19] end of the seals and he says you're not
[24:21] getting it so it wasn't that group
[24:26] either and technically everybody that's
[24:29] died up until this day we're standing
[24:31] here didn't get it either that's right
[24:33] that's right no shame people no no on
[24:36] the internet no shame these people are
[24:38] born again Holy Ghost filled people
[24:41] right but they're missing the true
[24:44] message of the hour right this hour
[24:46] that's right the Son of God Ministry is
[24:49] a message of the hour all through the
[24:51] church ages that's right from
[24:52] Revelations 1 to3 all those Messengers
[24:55] brought this message right here to get
[24:59] the spirit of God Into the Heart of
[25:01] unbelievers and make them become
[25:04] Believers that's right but they
[25:06] still die cuz a sin curse has not been
[25:11] taken away right I want to nail these in
[25:14] your head and then as we go through here
[25:16] maybe something will come out we're
[25:18] going to go through it in a simple form
[25:19] just for the children it's not going to
[25:20] be something that's going to be way up
[25:22] in the clouds cuz I think brother Bram
[25:24] said even the most eliberate person
[25:26] could understand this gospel amen right
[25:29] so an illiterate person is somebody that
[25:31] cannot even read that's right amen so if
[25:33] you can hear you can understand right
[25:36] right and that's what I put my Hope on
[25:39] is to be able to
[25:40] understand so brother brandom up until
[25:43] 1962 or 63 he was setting a platform
[25:47] remember he kept saying he said I don't
[25:48] know if I'm the one he said but if I'm
[25:50] not I'm setting a what a stage or what
[25:52] is a stage it's a platform I'm setting a
[25:56] spot that if I'm not the one to step up
[25:59] on it I'm making the way for somebody to
[26:01] step up on okay and he did make a way he
[26:04] just didn't see the two Ministries until
[26:07] here I believe the the Prophet The
[26:10] Prophet Jesus
[26:11] Christ took him to Revelations 10 out
[26:15] there in Tucson and showed him or maybe
[26:17] even in the room cuz he said he didn't
[26:19] know what SEALs was till he till he got
[26:20] there the first
[26:22] day and showed him because he kept
[26:25] saying if you read the seal book he said
[26:26] I hope you're getting something you're
[26:28] supposed to be getting something this
[26:29] week there's something going on this
[26:30] week I hope you're catching it then he
[26:32] comes up to the questions and answers
[26:34] right before he preaches the sealed and
[26:36] he says it's not even for
[26:39] you you're not even supposed to get
[26:42] it who told him
[26:45] that God told him that that's
[26:48] right but the reason I say God told him
[26:50] that is he could see the people didn't
[26:52] wasn't understanding because of the
[26:55] questions they ask on questions and
[26:56] answers he had read those questions that
[26:59] was on the questions and answers right
[27:01] before he preached the questions and
[27:02] answers right before he started in the
[27:04] questions he said you're not getting it
[27:06] it's not for you and he started talking
[27:08] about a receiver like a um radio station
[27:12] he said there's a certain Crystal
[27:13] that'll pick up a certain station what
[27:15] was he telling them that Crystal hadn't
[27:17] got here yet
[27:19] right they were tuned to the wrong
[27:22] station but they were getting the basic
[27:26] of sure that that that um that the white
[27:30] horse rider is now not the Holy Ghost
[27:32] the white horse rider is what Antichrist
[27:35] sure they get all that that's okay
[27:38] that's still not that still didn't
[27:39] change them right
[27:42] right but I believe God's now turning
[27:44] that knob and he's finding a group of
[27:46] people cuz you and I a lot of us weren't
[27:48] even born well y'all weren't even born
[27:50] in
[27:51] 1963 so a lot of us were didn't know
[27:55] nothing so that's right he was saying
[27:57] there's a group to come and that group
[28:00] has got to be us amen cuz everybody else
[28:03] is dead that's right and surely all the
[28:06] ones in 1963 that was sitting in that
[28:08] Tabernacle most of them are dead already
[28:12] anyway I read the New Testament and
[28:16] you'd be surprised how many times it
[28:18] says in the last day or in the latter
[28:20] day or whatever this is coming in the
[28:23] last day after two days yeah what after
[28:26] 2,000 years
[28:28] um and actually in Matthew there and 17
[28:31] but it was amazing how I think I
[28:33] underlined it how many times it said in
[28:36] the last day or the latter day or
[28:38] whatever this well remember Jesus spoke
[28:40] more of his second coming than he did of
[28:43] why he was there to start with right but
[28:45] now in in re in Matthew 17 the one we're
[28:48] talking
[28:50] about let's read that one time let's
[28:52] just finish it up right
[28:54] here and then next Sunday keep reading
[28:57] re Revelations 5 we'll get to it sooner
[28:58] or later probably more later than sooner
[29:02] but I want you to see everybody's like
[29:03] well what's the big deal about the seal
[29:05] what's this big deal about everybody
[29:07] said 47 to 63 brother R was wrong no
[29:10] from 47 to 63 brother randam was
[29:12] building a
[29:13] platform a firm foundation right
[29:17] zerubabel brother brandham was
[29:19] zerubabel he was the one to do we we'll
[29:23] read that next Sunday in Zachariah if
[29:24] you want to read the book of Zachariah
[29:25] it's only about three chapters
[29:28] but Zachariah said zerubabel will come
[29:30] and clean that Foundation off and begin
[29:33] to build a building right in chapter 17
[29:37] says after
[29:39] six
[29:43] days
[29:44] after 6,000 years or after six Church
[29:50] ages in the seventh age we're still
[29:52] living in the seventh age we we haven't
[29:54] we're not saying we're in in a different
[29:56] age we're we're still in the seventh
[29:58] Church age brother Brown said lay out a
[30:00] seal it go all the way to the end time
[30:02] all right but he's calling out a group
[30:04] of people after six
[30:07] days so after the six Church ages we
[30:09] know six Church agents is not going to
[30:11] get this right but after 6 days Jesus
[30:14] Took Peter James and
[30:16] John and he was transfigured before them
[30:19] his face did shine as the sun and his
[30:20] rment was white as
[30:22] snow and I didn't write where brother R
[30:24] said it but I wrote here he said we were
[30:26] represented there
[30:28] and behold there appeared to them Moses
[30:30] and El lias talking with him then
[30:33] answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord
[30:35] it is good for us to be
[30:38] here Jesus didn't want him to be
[30:41] here that's
[30:43] Earthly he wanted him to be in Heavenly
[30:45] places he wanted to be caught up where
[30:47] he was
[30:48] at of course Peter's Revelation
[30:52] was it's good to be here
[30:56] right said unto Jesus lord it's good for
[30:58] us to be here if thou Wilt let us make
[31:00] here three Tabernacles one for thee one
[31:02] for Moses one for Elijah brother BR said
[31:05] he wasn't building an Earthly temple
[31:07] building a Heavenly
[31:09] Temple while he yet spake Behold a
[31:11] bright Cloud overshadowed them and
[31:12] behold a voice out of the cloud said
[31:14] this is my beloved Son in whom I am well
[31:16] pleased hear ye
[31:19] him when the disciples heard it they
[31:21] fell on their face and were s afraid
[31:23] Jesus came and touched them and said
[31:25] arise and be not afraid
[31:27] Pray when they had lifted up their eyes
[31:30] they saw no man save Jesus
[31:32] only and as they came down from the
[31:34] mountain Jesus charged them saying tell
[31:36] the vision to no man until the son of
[31:39] man be risen
[31:41] again from the dead that's got to be in
[31:45] the end
[31:47] time he didn't raise twice 2,000 years
[31:50] ago he raised one time right now we
[31:53] didn't physically kill this son of man
[31:55] but what did we do
[32:02] we did away with a
[32:04] revelation the Revelation was hid it was
[32:07] still there even though I'm erasing this
[32:09] I can still see it written in there all
[32:12] right so this is what they
[32:19] got that's all they
[32:23] got cu the son of man hadn't been risen
[32:25] again that Vision could not be fulfilled
[32:28] Transfiguration glorification could not
[32:31] be fulfilled until the son of man be
[32:33] risen again so now that the prophet
[32:36] preached that message and now he's risen
[32:39] again at least he was the brother
[32:42] rown
[32:44] okay and there's some parts there that I
[32:46] could say
[32:48] that that he's dead
[32:52] too so he waiting on a group of people
[32:54] not just one
[32:55] man right
[32:57] but this revelation will get you in the
[32:59] body of Christ but you're still going to
[33:02] die at your appointed time that's right
[33:05] it's appointed under
[33:07] death man wants to die in the Judgment
[33:10] right brother bandam from 47 to 63 he
[33:14] preached this back because what happened
[33:16] after the first church age what
[33:19] happened you remember your church ages
[33:23] you had a lot of light this was gospel a
[33:27] a lot of Darkness a lot of Darkness what
[33:29] happened in that fourth age just a teeny
[33:31] bit of light the son of man was killed
[33:35] any Revelation any way for it to come
[33:38] back was hidden by the Catholic church
[33:41] or Catholicism or let's just say
[33:44] denominationalism all right then what
[33:46] happened you had a
[33:50] Reformation back
[33:53] right right but then at the end time
[33:56] time brother R said he put just a little
[33:58] bit of
[34:01] sorry it went back Dark
[34:04] Again the son of man's got raised in the
[34:07] end time the second
[34:10] time before this Vision can be fulfilled
[34:13] what a glorified body standing on the
[34:17] earth saying all power in heaven Earth
[34:19] been given unto me there's no other
[34:21] power anywhere else and then in
[34:23] Revelations 10 that's what we're reading
[34:25] next Sunday Revelations 10 7 says that
[34:28] that Mighty angel had to come
[34:30] down and then we'll finish that and then
[34:33] we'll get started in the breach actually
[34:35] read the
[34:38] breach that brother jul fory always says
[34:41] the breach produce the bleach the bleach
[34:45] produc
