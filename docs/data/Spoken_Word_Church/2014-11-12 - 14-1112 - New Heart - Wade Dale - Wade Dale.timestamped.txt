[19:39] but uh I think we had a good time in the
[19:42] Lord so uh thank you for your prayers I
[19:44] know a lot of you have asked how it's
[19:46] went how it went it went rather well so
[19:49] also good to have brother Nathaniel
[19:51] Green with us
[19:53] he didn't know until just a few months
[19:56] ago that he was a signer of the
[19:57] Declaration of Independence
[20:00] he's a little bit younger than he used
[20:02] to be but
[20:03] brother Nathaniel Green good to have you
[20:04] with us buddy been a good friend for a
[20:07] long time
[20:08] founder of Greene County Georgia
[20:10] actually you're exactly correct one of
[20:12] the deer hunting capitals of the world
[20:13] so I wanted to take him he's going
[20:16] hunting with me and the reason he come
[20:17] down here but he's already caught one
[20:19] deer
[20:21] and her name's Caitlin
[20:23] and uh he is engaged to be married
[20:33] so I thought I'd take him hunting before
[20:34] he got the real ring
[20:37] in his nose
[20:40] so we are hope Caitlyn's not watching in
[20:43] tonight she'll probably kill me

[22:37] chapter 11 verse 19 let's pray before we
[22:40] get started
[22:41] Heavenly Father we pray Lord tonight
[22:43] that you would
[22:45] not be a
[22:46] bystander in this service but father be
[22:49] an active participant
[22:50] you be the one that does the speaking
[22:52] you'll be the one that does the hearing
[22:54] you be the one Lord that opens our
[22:56] understanding because without you lord
[22:58] it'll just be a Meeting of Minds that we
[23:01] will just give an intellectual speech
[23:03] and Lord it'll be over but father I pray
[23:06] that you'd Quicken your word through our
[23:07] Heart Lord
[23:08] we pray that you would just be the one
[23:10] with the ones that are sick and not with
[23:11] us Lord the ones that are sin sick Lord
[23:14] down below us below our feeders and
[23:16] names of many people on that wall that
[23:19] needs salvation Lord and we claim them
[23:21] all in the name of Jesus Christ
[23:24] we pray that you'll just be with our
[23:25] loved ones father bless the ones that
[23:28] are on the missionary Fields Lord give
[23:30] them fruit for their labor father
[23:32] bless this day and keep us safe Lord we
[23:34] ask these things in Jesus name
[23:36] amen Ezekiel 11 verse 19 and I will give
[23:40] them one heart
[23:42] and I will put a new spirit
[23:44] within you
[23:46] and I will take the Stony heart out of
[23:48] their flesh and we'll give them
[23:50] and heart of Flesh that they may walk in
[23:53] my statutes and keep my ordinances and
[23:55] do them and they shall be my people and
[23:58] I will be
[23:59] their god let's go to Ezekiel 36 and
[24:02] read this one real quick and then you
[24:03] may be seated Ezekiel 36 verse 26 a new
[24:07] heart also will I give you because he's
[24:09] content Ezekiel is continuing the
[24:11] thought a new heart also will I give you
[24:13] and a new spirit will thou put within
[24:16] you and I will take away the Stony heart
[24:18] out of your flesh
[24:21] and I will give you an heart of Flesh
[24:23] and I will put my spirit within you and
[24:27] cause you to walk in my statutes and you
[24:29] shall keep my judgments and do them you
[24:32] may be seated in the Lord has blessings
[24:33] reading the word you see that says and
[24:35] do them so we're looking tonight we want
[24:37] to speak for a moment on a new heart
[24:41] and I want to take it to the elementary
[24:43] part of justification sanctification of
[24:47] baptism in the Holy Ghost and if I get
[24:48] time we're going to continue on up in
[24:50] the pyramid I I told Brother Louise and
[24:53] and brother
[24:54] um Bob on the way uh back I spoke to a
[24:59] brother and and you know how we teach it
[25:01] here we you just don't don't through go
[25:04] through one stage of justification
[25:07] there's justification in the pyramid
[25:10] a man of sanctification in the pyramid
[25:13] all right then you've got the Holy Ghost
[25:14] up there in the pyramid well this
[25:16] brother comes up to me and he says he
[25:17] said I've been preaching teaching on the
[25:19] Statue of a perfect man he said you know
[25:21] there's justification in that pyramid
[25:23] amen how about fell over
[25:25] right because you don't hear that you
[25:27] hardly hear this down and you know what
[25:28] he said and it makes sense that's why
[25:31] you know people say well you shouldn't
[25:32] go to ministers meeting because you
[25:33] don't learn anything I learned something
[25:35] I learned I learned one thing he said
[25:38] brother Wayne he said I believe the
[25:39] statue of perfect man is the centerpiece
[25:41] of the message amen
[25:43] listen to that the centerpiece of the
[25:46] message you know you got this table
[25:50] and you've got a centerpiece
[25:52] that draws your attention to that table
[25:55] that centerpiece is the most beautiful
[25:57] part of that table before they put the
[26:00] food on the table all right so that
[26:03] statue of perfect man that was well put
[26:06] that's the center piece of this message
[26:08] and I believe that because it was taught
[26:10] back in the in the early ages
[26:13] Peter taught it James John all those
[26:15] back in the in the first church age had
[26:18] those virtues working in their life and
[26:20] and you know that's what people don't
[26:22] understand
[26:23] brother Branham didn't bring us the
[26:26] Statue of a perfect man
[26:29] just like brother Brown didn't bring us
[26:31] to a new way to be born again right
[26:33] right brother Brown didn't bring us a
[26:34] new way to dress
[26:36] brother Brown didn't bring us a new way
[26:38] to act right
[26:41] brother Brown didn't bring us a new way
[26:42] to come to church
[26:45] the first church age had all that
[26:48] amen amen they had these virtues working
[26:50] in their life amen Faith virtue
[26:53] knowledge temperature patience Godless
[26:54] brotherly kindness all the way up they
[26:56] had all those things they had one God
[26:58] Doctrine right they had serpent seed
[27:00] right they had how to dress right they
[27:02] had how to live right brother Brown did
[27:04] not come to bring us a new way to live
[27:07] right
[27:11] I like why brother Keith Reed said bro
[27:13] this message was given for Preparation
[27:16] to get out of here with
[27:18] amen
[27:20] it wasn't brought to bring us a new way
[27:22] to do anything
[27:23] sure it does change our mind
[27:26] it sets our mind in order for Holiness
[27:29] it brings us to a a higher form of
[27:31] justification and a higher form of
[27:33] sanctification but it doesn't bring us a
[27:36] new new birth
[27:37] when Jesus said you must be born again
[27:39] that's settled it forever with me
[27:42] and brother random never changed that
[27:44] you must be born again
[27:46] Nicodemus
[27:49] just believe
[27:51] and you got it yeah yeah and you'll be
[27:53] born just like me
[27:55] no
[27:56] that's not the way it is exactly we have
[27:59] to have a new birth brother Bynum come
[28:01] to bring us clarity
[28:03] Clarity make it clear of how to get back
[28:07] to that and to restore back to the faith
[28:10] that was once delivered to the Saints
[28:12] amen
[28:13] but he did not bring us a new way to get
[28:16] born again
[28:17] and tonight because we're gonna and that
[28:19] was what we were speaking on this past
[28:21] weekend and I wanted to take it out of
[28:24] the Bible
[28:25] so we're going to take it out of the
[28:26] Bible and then bring the prophet's
[28:28] message in but right there in the Book
[28:29] of Ezekiel there are your three stages
[28:32] in Ezekiel 36 26.
[28:35] um
[28:38] we got young kids back there running
[28:40] them
[28:41] they're running the Enterprise tonight
[28:43] little Captain Kirk and little Spock
[28:46] back there put that scripture back up
[28:48] there you go buddy
[28:50] brother Josiah is running the camera and
[28:52] uh
[28:53] and uh
[28:55] Bob's son's running the running the
[28:57] quote so
[29:00] a new heart
[29:02] a new spirit
[29:04] and I'll put my spirit
[29:06] three stages right Ezekiel is showing
[29:10] how did Brother Branham get three stages
[29:13] he just come up with it
[29:15] no he took it out of the Bible
[29:17] the Bible gives you three stages a new
[29:20] heart also will I give you and a new
[29:23] spirit will I put within you we're going
[29:26] to find out what that is that's not the
[29:27] Holy Spirit
[29:29] right amen that's not always bad
[29:32] and I will put my spirit within you
[29:34] that's the Holy Spirit okay so there's
[29:37] your three stages but let's look and
[29:39] drop back and let brother Branham
[29:42] explain some things so let's go to the
[29:44] first quote
[29:46] tonight and we'll see if we can bring it
[29:48] up
[29:49] it may be kind of Elementary but it's
[29:51] just something that didn't come up you
[29:52] know I I've had it on my heart for a
[29:54] while so
[29:56] and north at 1965 now this is after the
[29:59] seals broke all right and north at night
[30:02] 8 15 65. now now that the church
[30:06] that his very whole purpose was the
[30:08] church now how do we get into this
[30:10] church by one Spirit we'll all baptize
[30:12] into one body
[30:15] the church the body of Christ it cannot
[30:18] fail now here is what happens now watch
[30:22] this just a lick little figurative
[30:24] picture here brother Branham again shows
[30:27] his drawing of three rings you remember
[30:29] the three rings brother Ernie was was uh
[30:31] showing it last Sunday and uh and we see
[30:36] that the outer Court the inner court and
[30:38] holy holies now what he's doing here let
[30:40] me let me show what verse paragraph 122.
[30:43] now this outside man is the flesh that's
[30:46] what we look at what we see and it has
[30:49] five inlets to that body and any grammar
[30:52] school child as myself would know
[30:54] there's five senses control the body
[30:57] see taste feel smell and here without
[30:59] that you can't touch the body right
[31:02] that's the only way you have to the body
[31:05] see taste feel smell here you see it
[31:07] taste it feel it now that is the evil
[31:10] one on the outside
[31:13] all right
[31:14] now First Peter 1 23 shows exactly
[31:17] Peter says being born again not of
[31:20] corruptable seed
[31:22] okay so that's a dual meaning
[31:25] corruptable seed would be corruptable
[31:27] word but anyway you were born of
[31:29] corruptable seed from your mom and daddy
[31:31] right
[31:32] amen you we were all born in sin we
[31:35] there's none of us born right right if
[31:37] we did then we were born right the first
[31:39] time and we didn't need a new birth all
[31:41] right but we all need a new birth so
[31:44] that's the flesh born of corruptable
[31:46] seed but what we're trying to do is is
[31:48] we're trying to put on incorruption
[31:51] right
[31:52] working brother Louise from the inside
[31:54] out not from the outside in right all
[31:56] right we're trying to work from the
[31:58] inside out now
[32:01] inside of that
[32:03] is a spirit
[32:07] which you become where you're born in
[32:09] the earth and the Breath of Life is
[32:12] breathed into him
[32:13] that spirit is of a worldly nature
[32:17] because it was not given from God now
[32:19] watch
[32:20] watch your profit though because all All
[32:22] Souls are given from God but watch what
[32:25] he says he says but it was
[32:27] parentheses given permitted right by God
[32:31] because Ezekiel even tells us you that
[32:33] All Souls are mine
[32:35] Satan can't give you a soul if Satan
[32:37] could give you a soul then Satan has
[32:38] seed then Satan is a Creator just like
[32:40] God is
[32:42] remember Satan's a perverter so anything
[32:44] God has God give it to us first right
[32:47] then Satan copies behind that okay he
[32:51] couldn't produce an able
[32:53] he couldn't produce a cane of his own
[32:55] self right so we had to borrow the seed
[32:59] from the Beast
[33:01] to inject himself into the human race
[33:04] all right so we're okay with that I know
[33:06] it's simple but we're going to try to
[33:07] get to the Statue of perfect man but I
[33:10] was telling him on the road sometimes we
[33:13] need to go back and review you know you
[33:14] don't always start trigonometry and
[33:17] algebra in calculus when you're in the
[33:19] 12th grade someday you may drop back to
[33:22] one plus one equal two
[33:23] so you know you need a little review so
[33:25] let's review this because I want us to
[33:27] see where we are because brother Brown
[33:30] said you can know where you are at with
[33:32] God at any moment
[33:35] all right any moment all right now
[33:38] inside of that is a spirit which you
[33:40] become when you're born in the earth and
[33:41] the Breath of Life is breathed into him
[33:43] that spirit is of a worldly nature right
[33:47] because it what that's that the nature
[33:49] was not given to you by God
[33:52] the spirit the soul of man watch because
[33:55] it was not given from God it was
[33:56] permitted by God right all right
[34:00] so now remember if we stay there we're
[34:02] in trouble
[34:04] and I've got another quote that I'm not
[34:06] going to read but I read it to the to
[34:08] the brethren
[34:10] brother Brown says the reason you were
[34:12] given a soul we're reading a second part
[34:14] of it it's because to make a choice
[34:17] the animal can't make a choice because
[34:20] he doesn't have a soul you were given a
[34:24] soul to where you can change one way or
[34:28] the other all right and we'll get to
[34:30] that in a minute it's not faith and
[34:32] doubt right it's Faith or doubt one of
[34:35] the two all right they're both if Faith
[34:38] listen if faith and doubt is in your
[34:40] soul then you have to solve
[34:44] Satan give you one God give you one you
[34:46] go back to the two Soul Doctrine right
[34:48] which is not right because Satan can't
[34:50] give you us all
[34:52] right God gives you a soul Satan
[34:54] perverts your soul remember what I just
[34:56] said God gives you something Satan
[34:58] perverts it what you have to do is you
[35:01] have to change that thing by your free
[35:03] moral agency whether you want to stay a
[35:06] sinner or become a saint right all right
[35:10] your choice
[35:12] remember we were chosen in him not by
[35:15] him
[35:16] all right we were chosen in him before
[35:17] the foundation of the world if we were
[35:19] specifically chosen by him I was telling
[35:22] the Brethren you got to understand one
[35:25] thing if there ever was a just person in
[35:28] the world it has to be God
[35:31] because that's a white Throne judgment
[35:32] God is going to have to judge
[35:36] and he is a righteous judge the
[35:38] scripture says
[35:39] so if Adolf Hitler if he's standing
[35:42] there and Adolf Hitler in his spirit
[35:46] he looks up and sees me and he says
[35:50] you put something in him you didn't put
[35:52] in me
[35:54] how can God be just and judge Adolf
[35:58] Hitler if he put something in me
[36:00] different than he put an Adolf Hitler
[36:03] Paul says I contend all
[36:06] all born in sin all under the law
[36:12] until you talk to some people all don't
[36:15] mean all all means just other people
[36:18] but but remember God to be if you do no
[36:21] more than that to be a just God he's got
[36:24] to bring every person from Abel down to
[36:26] right now he has to bring him same way
[36:31] but then we're going to see in a minute
[36:33] that that's the same way we get back is
[36:35] through a three-step process and you
[36:38] can't get there any other way right
[36:40] amen you can't just you know I thought I
[36:43] told him I said we've come to the to the
[36:45] part to where we should be saying now
[36:47] like Paul did he walks in and he says
[36:50] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[36:52] you've been in this message
[36:56] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[36:57] you've been in this message
[37:01] or you just come into the message
[37:03] getting your thought get a new idea
[37:05] getting your spirit yeah
[37:09] yeah we need to be careful about these
[37:10] spirits and spiritual stuff you know
[37:12] Judas was spiritual
[37:16] Satan's the most spiritual person in the
[37:18] world besides Jesus Christ amen
[37:20] so we need to watch this being spiritual
[37:22] stuff
[37:23] we need to make sure that it rings right
[37:24] with everybody all of us with the
[37:26] spirits
[37:27] now inside of that is the spirit
[37:30] I already read it permitted by God now
[37:33] you got that for every child that's born
[37:35] in the world Listen is born in sin
[37:37] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[37:39] speaking lies amen that right so that
[37:42] person inside there is a center to begin
[37:46] with now what special part do we have in
[37:48] that
[37:49] none
[37:52] we have representation
[37:58] we have representation
[38:00] that we come to it right all right
[38:04] so the person inside there is a center
[38:06] to begin with how clear is that is that
[38:07] okay is that clear enough you were a
[38:09] sinner when you were born in the world
[38:11] my soul was as black as nine
[38:15] but Darkness has taken flight amen so
[38:19] that person there is a sinner to begin
[38:20] with now it's got five inlets and then
[38:23] five inlets I don't know whether I can
[38:25] call them right now for now when the
[38:27] first I know is thought conscious love
[38:29] choice no conscious love reason there's
[38:33] five inlets to the spirit I'm not
[38:35] correcting brother Branham but you know
[38:36] what it is memory reason conscious
[38:39] affection imagination
[38:41] everybody got that all right memory
[38:43] reason conscious affection imagination
[38:45] all right now
[38:47] you're giving that to to
[38:50] contact the spirit part but that Spirit
[38:53] can either be one or the other
[38:55] because your memory can be good or your
[38:56] memory can be bad right your conscious
[38:58] can be good or your conscious can be bad
[39:00] amen all the way down your love is for
[39:03] your wife it's filial love not even
[39:06] close to agape love
[39:08] because Agape loves what comes to you
[39:10] and it's trying to work its way back out
[39:13] to where you can love God but now watch
[39:15] you're going to get a another Spirit
[39:17] though before you get the Holy Spirit
[39:19] right
[39:21] right seems like it's a little crowded
[39:22] in there yeah
[39:24] but it's not
[39:26] but remember the other day when we were
[39:29] speaking and I read you the quote and
[39:30] who is this Melchizedek brother Brown
[39:32] said every son of the faith is going to
[39:33] go through this journey sure so if
[39:35] Abraham went through justification
[39:37] sanctification and baptism Holy Ghost
[39:39] have met God in human flesh you're going
[39:41] to have to go through justification
[39:42] sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost
[39:44] and meet God in human flesh
[39:47] through a preacher
[39:52] now it's got five Outlets or and I told
[39:54] you what you were memory reason
[39:56] conscious affection imagination you
[39:59] can't think with your body
[40:01] you have to think with your spirit right
[40:04] you can't have conscience in your body
[40:07] it has no mental faculty at all right
[40:10] your body doesn't so you have to think
[40:12] with your spirit amen amen you have to
[40:15] reason you can't reason with your
[40:17] physical being
[40:18] because reason doesn't see taste feel
[40:20] smell or hear reason is what you can
[40:24] make in your mind right
[40:27] right the greatest battle ever fought
[40:28] Brother Gary I swear in the mind because
[40:31] Satan can come down through those memory
[40:33] reason conscious affection imagination
[40:35] that's his playground
[40:39] in that what don't you know what bothers
[40:41] you even as a Christian that bothers me
[40:43] my memory I can't I wish I could rate
[40:45] God can raise his but we can't erase
[40:47] ours all right reason is what you can
[40:50] make in your mind if you're asleep or
[40:52] you're out your body is lying there dead
[40:54] but your spirit can still reason right
[40:56] all right there's five senses that
[40:58] control that Inside Man and now to the
[41:01] last man which is the soul there is only
[41:04] one sense that controls that
[41:06] so it's not faith and doubt right
[41:09] right that means there's two in there
[41:11] together
[41:12] it's Faith or doubt all right so that's
[41:16] what controls that is what now brother
[41:18] Raymond's calling this this your soul
[41:20] this is what it is and that is free
[41:23] moral agencies free will to choose or to
[41:28] reject right all right then we'll go
[41:30] back to Ezekiel 18 20 and 21. Watch What
[41:35] Happens here look
[41:38] watch the faith or doubt
[41:42] brother Brown had to get this from
[41:43] somewhere yeah he had to get out of the
[41:45] Bible he was a word Prophet God cutting
[41:48] down come could not come and just give
[41:50] him a revelation
[41:51] and he take it and go with it remember
[41:53] he said I'd spend all day in the
[41:55] scripture see it was a word prophet he
[41:57] had to go back and put it in the word he
[42:00] may have never read Ezekiel 18 but
[42:01] that's where he got it from right all
[42:03] right watch because it's the soul that
[42:05] sinneth it shall die now if we stop
[42:07] right there we have no hopes
[42:12] we Have No Way Out
[42:14] right the Bible says the soul that
[42:16] sinneth
[42:19] is dies
[42:21] the sun shall not bear the iniquity of
[42:23] the father neither shall the father bear
[42:24] the iniquity of the son what what
[42:27] Ezekiel is showing us through the word
[42:30] is that I don't have to give an account
[42:31] for my son he don't have to give an
[42:33] account for me if his sin if his soul
[42:36] sins he's going to die if my soul sins
[42:39] I'm gonna die but I am not connected
[42:42] with him as far as our soul remember
[42:44] we're a free moral agent okay and you
[42:48] know what I like that that gives me a
[42:50] free choice
[42:51] the sun shall not bear the iniquity of
[42:53] the father neither shall the father bear
[42:55] the iniquity of the son the
[42:57] righteousness of the righteous shall be
[42:59] upon him and the wickedness of the
[43:02] wicked shall be upon him look verse 21.
[43:05] I like that word but
[43:08] here's our way out
[43:10] but if the wicked will turn from all his
[43:14] sins
[43:16] that he hath committed now wait a minute
[43:19] the soul of sin shall die
[43:21] but
[43:22] if the wicked will turn from all the
[43:25] sins that he has committed what does way
[43:27] with Seed doctrine has done it
[43:29] seedlines
[43:30] if you were born from Cain you're dead
[43:32] if you're born from Abel you're alive
[43:33] now if you're born from Mom and Daddy
[43:35] you're dead right period I don't care
[43:37] who you are
[43:38] Prophet king or whoever right there's
[43:40] only one person born of a woman that was
[43:42] born right
[43:43] that was Jesus Christ
[43:46] but if the wicked will turn from all his
[43:48] sins that he has committed and keep all
[43:51] my statues and do that which is lawful
[43:53] and right
[43:54] he's turned something around here
[43:57] he's went from Death To Life
[43:59] and to do that which is lawful and right
[44:02] he shall surely live he shall not die
[44:06] faith
[44:08] or doubt right
[44:12] right can't have both in the soul right
[44:15] right everybody understand that can't
[44:16] have that in the soul you can't have
[44:18] faith and doubt right
[44:21] right I like that you like I like that
[44:23] that gives us a way out that gives us
[44:25] that all the soul of sins and she'll die
[44:28] but
[44:30] if the wicked and that was us
[44:32] if the wicked will turn from all his
[44:35] sins that he hath committed and keep all
[44:37] my statues and do that which is lawful
[44:39] and right he shall surely live he shall
[44:41] not
[44:42] die I like that don't you
[44:45] so I'm gonna let's go into the future
[44:46] home just for a minute and uh and read a
[44:50] couple of quotes because to me I was
[44:52] telling the um the Brethren you know
[44:54] there is a
[44:56] there's a Doctrine in the message that
[44:57] brother Brown changed the way to get the
[44:59] new birth after the seals broke right
[45:01] Aaron's heard it I've heard it I've
[45:03] heard it preached a bunch of baloney
[45:05] you know why because watch this this is
[45:08] 1964 after the seals broke we have to do
[45:12] this in The Minister's meeting you have
[45:14] to just you act like they're all babies
[45:18] most are
[45:22] 1964-0802 future home now I told him I
[45:25] said
[45:26] if I had if if they came to me and said
[45:29] look we're going to lock you up in
[45:30] prison for 10 years and you get one
[45:32] message book I take that message book
[45:34] right there
[45:35] because it gives me it shows me
[45:36] justification sanctification baptism the
[45:38] Holy Ghost it shows me what's going to
[45:40] happen in the Millennium and it shows me
[45:41] what I'm going to my future home right
[45:43] I'll take that book right there
[45:45] one book now if they give me a series I
[45:48] take the seals but one Buck I take that
[45:51] book right there because look notice how
[45:53] God makes it plain to us and if that
[45:55] wasn't a great confirmation a good a
[45:58] great loving blessing from God now
[46:00] listen to this Prophet this is 1964.
[46:03] after he changed the way to get the new
[46:04] birth
[46:06] so man says
[46:09] that sense of boy
[46:11] first time ever Christ dealt with me
[46:14] I've still always taught those three
[46:17] stages of Grace
[46:19] that where'd he change
[46:21] being changed right if he did your life
[46:24] of course now they're saying he's lying
[46:26] yeah so
[46:27] forget that notice if it isn't true now
[46:32] right all right then let's go to
[46:35] paragraph 87. now the first step now
[46:37] watch brother Brown now what he's doing
[46:39] is
[46:40] excuse me
[46:42] we have remember we go before the world
[46:45] does right the world goes through three
[46:48] stages justification Saints against
[46:49] baptism the Holy Ghost but it does not
[46:51] go before us because listen we fell
[46:54] first
[46:56] then the Earth fell after we fell so now
[46:59] whatever found first has got to come
[47:01] back to Power
[47:03] before the Earth can come back for the
[47:06] people to live on
[47:08] so that's what he's explaining in the
[47:10] future home he's explaining the three
[47:12] stages of Grace as as it will happen to
[47:16] the world because remember when we were
[47:18] in organized religion in the Baptist
[47:21] Church they say well the Bible says the
[47:24] Heaven and Earth will pass away
[47:27] so what their pretense is and most
[47:29] people in denominations see that this
[47:33] world is going to be blown away and
[47:35] we're going to go to heaven
[47:37] now thank God we got a prophet that
[47:39] looked up the word pass away
[47:43] it means changed right
[47:45] right are burnt off
[47:47] not annihilated so the Earth's not going
[47:49] to be annihilated look this Earth was
[47:51] created in Isaiah 44 or 45 I believe
[47:54] says this Earth was created to be
[47:57] inhabited now that's the Eternal Word of
[48:00] God so this world with this Earth will
[48:02] be inhabited by his people but now he
[48:06] can't listen here's my point if God
[48:10] can't come to this earth
[48:13] if his feet can't touch this Earth
[48:16] before it goes through those three
[48:18] stages God's not going to dwell in your
[48:22] soul right right without going through
[48:24] those three stages amen
[48:28] now the first step is repentance toward
[48:32] God
[48:33] and then follows after that is water
[48:36] baptism
[48:37] that word repent is something we're
[48:40] losing in the end time
[48:42] we try to get them to the water no get
[48:45] them to repent right
[48:49] if they truly repent the baptism will be
[48:52] sure because watch what he says repent
[48:54] and be baptized the name of Jesus Christ
[48:55] see water baptism follows
[49:00] follows showing that repentance was
[49:04] genuine all right
[49:07] excuse me are to remit our past sins
[49:11] that has nothing to do with future sins
[49:15] all right so this is just a simple part
[49:17] of justification and sanctification but
[49:18] we gotta go through it
[49:23] or to remit our past sins that has
[49:25] nothing to do with future sin
[49:27] that's what you call saved
[49:30] right that's what you call saved I've
[49:33] been saved I repented of my sins God was
[49:36] just to forgive me of my sins I was
[49:38] saved now if I die right then I'm going
[49:41] to go to heaven but I won't be bragged
[49:43] right is that all right I won't be
[49:45] bribed because I don't have because
[49:46] we're going to read this in a minute
[49:48] your sin's been chopped off but the
[49:50] thing that made you do it still in there
[49:52] so God can't be in there all right so
[49:55] you got to repent
[49:56] be baptized
[49:58] excuse me or to remit our past sins that
[50:01] has nothing new with future sin it only
[50:02] remains in other words you repent
[50:04] tonight God's just to forgive you your
[50:06] sins if it's a true repentance you go
[50:08] outside get in the car and get killed
[50:09] you're going to heaven
[50:12] all right
[50:13] the Bible says in John 3 16.
[50:17] for God so loved the word he gave his
[50:18] only begotten son whosoever believeth in
[50:20] him shall not perish
[50:22] but have everlasting life all right
[50:24] there's going to a lot of people be in
[50:26] heaven
[50:27] that didn't have the Holy Ghost down
[50:29] here right
[50:31] now amen but they were God was just to
[50:34] forgive them of their sins he knew that
[50:36] their repentance was genuine but now if
[50:40] you continue on months down the road
[50:42] you're going to continue to go back do
[50:44] the same sin you were doing
[50:46] so maybe your repentance wasn't genuine
[50:49] we'll see as you go through our as we'll
[50:51] go through our life it only remits
[50:53] repent and be baptized in the name of
[50:55] Jesus Christ what for remission taking
[50:57] away a past sin has nothing to do with
[51:00] the future right
[51:01] right just your sin has been chopped off
[51:03] what you did right right you can't
[51:06] repent for one item done you never done
[51:08] it Adam did you just get forgiveness for
[51:11] what you've done the old nature is still
[51:15] there exactly
[51:16] all right
[51:17] same way with justification of the earth
[51:20] remember what happens when the earth
[51:22] justified in the days of Noah God
[51:25] chopped off
[51:27] right the world's past sins
[51:29] only eight Souls were saved but what
[51:32] came across in the ark ham
[51:36] just as soon as man come right down on
[51:38] the Earth again and started multiplying
[51:40] they went right back to sinning the same
[51:42] way they did before all right
[51:45] you can't repent for what Adam done
[51:46] you've never done it Adam did it you
[51:48] just get forgiveness for what you've
[51:49] done the old nature is still there
[51:52] all right in Ezekiel 36 26 let's go back
[51:54] a new heart also will I give you all
[51:58] right
[51:59] and a new spirit will output within you
[52:01] because we're coming down to here
[52:04] a new heart will I give you all right
[52:07] justification
[52:09] sure he'll get it's an accent those who
[52:11] he's Justified he's already glorified
[52:14] amen if you're truly Justified truly
[52:17] you'll go on to the glorification all
[52:20] right so a new heart also will I give
[52:22] you and a new spirit will I put within
[52:24] you and I will take away the Stony heart
[52:27] out of your flesh
[52:29] because your flesh is going to start
[52:30] acting with what's inside amen amen and
[52:33] I will give you a heart of Flesh right
[52:35] let's go back to the future home now
[52:36] then secondly oh we got the first part
[52:39] down right I'm sure
[52:41] then secondly comes sanctification which
[52:44] sets our mind in order for Holiness to
[52:48] think right remember
[52:51] you've been cleaned
[52:53] and we're going to read it right here in
[52:54] Matthew you've been clean but nothing's
[52:56] come into to replace that right all
[52:58] right because that's what happened
[53:01] excuse me when Jesus when he dripped his
[53:04] blood on the earth and Sanctified the
[53:06] Earth remember all of our bodies were in
[53:07] the Earth
[53:08] but now remember that didn't do away
[53:10] with sin
[53:12] at that moment
[53:14] as soon as Jesus was ascended they just
[53:17] kept right on sinning right
[53:19] right until they come to the day of
[53:21] Pentecost and 120 Upper Room got the
[53:23] Holy Ghost and others got the Holy Ghost
[53:24] but here we are in sanctification when
[53:27] the unclean Spirit Matthew 12 43 when
[53:29] the unclean Spirit has gone out of a man
[53:31] unclean Spirit goes out
[53:35] because remember he says I'm gonna give
[53:37] you a new spirit
[53:38] then he saith I will walk through Dry
[53:41] places seeking rest and findeth none so
[53:44] the unclean Spirit the the smoking the
[53:46] drinking the the running around the all
[53:49] the things of the world
[53:51] that unclean Spirit should go out of you
[53:55] at sanctification
[53:57] okay
[53:58] all right
[54:00] then he saith I will return into my
[54:03] house from whence I came out see he's
[54:05] even claiming it's still his house
[54:08] yeah I didn't see that just a little
[54:09] while ago
[54:10] who is that that unclean Spirit saying
[54:12] I'm going back to my house
[54:14] because remember he dwelled there for a
[54:16] long time he did with me
[54:18] and he said I will return into my house
[54:23] so there's got to be a change
[54:26] it's not faith and doubt it's got to be
[54:28] Faith or doubt right from whence I came
[54:30] out and when he has come he financed it
[54:33] empty
[54:34] swept remember what sanctification
[54:36] cleaned and set aside for service all
[54:39] right
[54:41] empty swept and garnished right
[54:44] right you go to church you do all the
[54:46] things you're supposed to do then go
[54:48] with he and taketh with himself seven
[54:50] other Spirits more wicked than himself
[54:53] and they enter in and dwell there and
[54:56] the last state of that man is worse than
[54:58] the first even so shall it be also unto
[55:02] this wicked generation right all right
[55:05] you know as well as I do how many times
[55:07] have I preached here in this church
[55:08] sanctification is the best and the worst
[55:12] position you can be in
[55:14] hey man do I need to explain that maybe
[55:16] some of you knew ones I need to explain
[55:18] it but if that unclean Spirit goes out
[55:21] he's not going to bring seven more of
[55:24] his drinking buddies with him right
[55:26] right he's going to go straight to Satan
[55:28] and say look I need some religious
[55:30] Devils right
[55:32] right we need to make this guy religious
[55:33] right
[55:36] right we need to make him religious we
[55:39] don't need to make him eight times more
[55:40] drunk
[55:42] no he thinks he's okay we're going to
[55:44] bring him into church and set him down
[55:45] and we're going to feel him full of
[55:47] something and it ain't the Holy Spirit
[55:49] right it's a spirit all right
[55:51] cotton
[55:53] got it everybody okay with that all
[55:55] right so far then now this is the header
[55:58] here should be the future home it's not
[56:00] there I didn't put it there it's not
[56:02] their fault it's mine right here should
[56:04] be the future home paragraph 92 then the
[56:06] next comes the baptism of Fire
[56:09] of the fire and holy ghost that God
[56:12] might dwell
[56:13] in
[56:15] Us Now where's he at before he's not
[56:17] dwelling in us right
[56:20] one is with god brother Bram said the
[56:22] disciples could not understand Jesus
[56:24] because God wasn't in them yet right
[56:27] that's just too simple to understand
[56:29] yeah
[56:31] I want to stop here for a minute and and
[56:34] make a point and I I'm not going to call
[56:36] any names
[56:37] but one brother he took three cups
[56:42] one brother took two cups and they were
[56:44] explaining how God was in your soul and
[56:46] Satan gave you a a nature on that soul
[56:49] and then I ain't got enough cups
[56:54] and then something else happened right
[56:55] here and the guy got all this piled up
[56:59] and then when God comes he takes away
[57:01] this and he takes away this and you
[57:04] realize that this always was there
[57:08] I like that cup because it's black
[57:11] God ain't black
[57:13] ain't got nothing new with black
[57:16] you understand what I'm saying now what
[57:18] did Brother Branham use
[57:21] brother Branham used
[57:24] one cup
[57:27] we're talking about not talking about
[57:28] communion either
[57:30] he used one cup
[57:32] it's too simple they sit there and it
[57:34] looked like one of them things has got
[57:35] the shell game with the shells
[57:37] underneath it you know where they're
[57:38] moving stuff around and moving this
[57:40] around no you know what
[57:42] brother Branham say God reaches down and
[57:45] picks up a cup
[57:46] right it's dirty right
[57:51] good anyway
[57:53] because you know you watch them guys
[57:54] they start stacking stuff on top of each
[57:56] other and moving stuff around and you're
[57:58] like
[57:58] just use one right
[58:00] just one
[58:02] brother Brown said God picks up that
[58:04] glass
[58:05] dare he to drink out of it because it's
[58:07] dirty right
[58:08] but he has he has picked it up
[58:12] because he wants to use it for something
[58:18] he cleans it out
[58:21] sanctification he cleans it out
[58:26] and then he puts it in service right one
[58:29] cup amen
[58:30] amen not three or four and all these you
[58:33] know stacking on top of each other
[58:35] that's okay
[58:38] because you do have a nature that's
[58:40] attached to you
[58:42] it's an adamic Human Nature
[58:46] and it's sinful
[58:48] but your soul is not exchanged right
[58:51] right
[58:53] I I one of the brothers there at the
[58:56] meeting he didn't uh he didn't know what
[58:59] brother Brown meant now this brother's
[59:00] been in the message 40 years and he
[59:01] didn't know what brother meant brother
[59:03] random meant by the you know brother
[59:05] Brown said he doesn't believe in the
[59:06] pre-existence of Soul or transmigration
[59:09] souls he said the Mormon doctrine of
[59:11] pre-existence well if you'll go to your
[59:13] Eagle views
[59:15] there's a little box there you can punch
[59:16] that box and it brings the Mormon
[59:18] doctrine of pre-existence of Souls and
[59:22] it'll explain it to you gives you about
[59:23] three or four pages how that we all were
[59:26] Souls
[59:27] individuals in heaven before the world
[59:31] I had two Mormon uh secretaries so I
[59:34] know I asked them I grilled them every
[59:35] day about stuff but we were all up there
[59:38] and Jesus had a way for us to be saved
[59:41] and Satan had a way for us to be saved
[59:44] we were all to come down here and Jesus
[59:46] said well not everybody's going to be
[59:48] saved not everyone's going to want to be
[59:50] saved so I'm only going to save the ones
[59:53] that I can save
[59:54] Satan stands up and says well I can save
[59:57] them all
[59:59] every one of them I can save them all
[1:00:01] well supposedly God the Father stands up
[1:00:04] and says
[1:00:05] we're not going to use your plan Satan
[1:00:07] now this is true you read it I'm well
[1:00:09] Satan we're not going to use your plan
[1:00:11] because everybody can't be saved we're
[1:00:14] going to use my son Jesus's plan
[1:00:16] that's the way it is I mean that's the
[1:00:18] Mormon doctor and then we come down here
[1:00:20] to take on human flesh well Satan comes
[1:00:23] down here with his Fallen Angels can't
[1:00:25] get into flesh but he's trying to press
[1:00:27] us
[1:00:28] he's trying to press into our flesh so
[1:00:31] that's the doctrine of pre-existence or
[1:00:33] so brother Brian said I don't believe
[1:00:34] that he said what were you what were we
[1:00:36] brother Brandon before we were born he
[1:00:38] said you were nothing
[1:00:40] only in the mind of God you were nothing
[1:00:42] you weren't a spot you weren't a place
[1:00:45] you weren't a person you weren't a soul
[1:00:47] floating around
[1:00:49] that's what he said we were nothing
[1:00:52] except in the mind of God
[1:00:55] all right
[1:00:57] but still I you know I just I like to
[1:00:59] use one cut
[1:01:01] one cup to me works just great I don't
[1:01:03] have to do no explaining
[1:01:05] it was just I was I was unclean and now
[1:01:08] I'm clean all right and and I accepted
[1:01:11] the salvation of God
[1:01:14] and he saved my soul
[1:01:16] okay
[1:01:21] and that's why I told him I said and
[1:01:23] I'll use brother Louise for an example
[1:01:26] he said man when I first come to church
[1:01:27] here he said I I couldn't understand
[1:01:29] what brother they were saying
[1:01:31] you know had a hard time
[1:01:33] you know he said but now he said if you
[1:01:35] follow him a little while you can
[1:01:36] understand what he's saying well that's
[1:01:37] exactly the way it is with anybody
[1:01:38] really I mean you you can preach a
[1:01:41] simple Doctrine or a simple you know
[1:01:44] um like tonight and pretty much
[1:01:46] everybody will get it and it's a social
[1:01:48] gospel but but we don't preach social
[1:01:50] gospels here
[1:01:51] we try to get a little meat involved a
[1:01:54] man but if you listen
[1:01:57] and don't do like them guys and listen
[1:01:59] to refute
[1:02:01] then you might learn something
[1:02:03] and um and and learn something every
[1:02:05] Sunday I wouldn't come church if I
[1:02:08] didn't learn something
[1:02:13] some of you must get enough in one
[1:02:15] service
[1:02:19] I still got scripture for that
[1:02:21] you can stay gone all you want to but I
[1:02:23] got I got scripture for that you must
[1:02:24] not believe the day is approaching then
[1:02:26] the next comes the baptism of the fire
[1:02:28] and holy ghost that God might dwell in
[1:02:30] us and the fire of God cleanses our
[1:02:33] hearts from sin now watch heart
[1:02:37] heart's not this thing heart is your
[1:02:39] inner being your soul that's the inside
[1:02:41] guy all right so it cleanses our hearts
[1:02:44] from sin and puts the Holy Ghost Inside
[1:02:48] right
[1:02:49] because it wasn't there to start with
[1:02:55] if it was you wouldn't need it
[1:02:59] then we bring forth the same life that
[1:03:02] this did because that's in us all right
[1:03:07] so now let's compare it with Ezekiel 36
[1:03:09] 27 rolled up bro Zach
[1:03:12] and I will put my spirit within you
[1:03:16] all right now we're going to read this
[1:03:17] in a little bit where brother Brown
[1:03:18] breaks this down but this is your third
[1:03:21] stage I will put my spirit because it's
[1:03:24] not your spirit made over right
[1:03:26] right it's the holy spirit amen all
[1:03:28] right we don't believe in an exchange of
[1:03:30] the soul but we believe in the change
[1:03:34] a change right
[1:03:36] because it was dead
[1:03:39] scripture says
[1:03:40] the woman is dead while she liveth
[1:03:45] weren't you married first time
[1:03:48] right
[1:03:50] we were all married to Satan between
[1:03:52] Satan and Eve right we were all married
[1:03:55] between we're all we all had a first
[1:03:56] husband that had to die
[1:03:59] if not you can't marry again or you're
[1:04:00] an adulterer
[1:04:02] and I will put my spirit within you and
[1:04:05] cause you
[1:04:08] to walk in my statues now buddy that's a
[1:04:10] radical it caused you to do something
[1:04:12] and you shall keep my judgments and do
[1:04:14] them all right future home keep going
[1:04:18] now he takes the place where we
[1:04:21] are to dwell in through the same process
[1:04:23] now he's called The Church through
[1:04:26] justification called it through
[1:04:28] sanctification right I don't want to
[1:04:30] stop here for a minute and then filled
[1:04:32] it with the Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:04:34] we must know that we went through a
[1:04:36] stage of justification right
[1:04:39] right exactly right where God forgive us
[1:04:41] of our past sins you know why or we
[1:04:43] still have them right
[1:04:46] right we have to go through a definite
[1:04:48] period of sanctification it may last two
[1:04:51] years two months or two minutes right
[1:04:56] amen
[1:04:58] and I believe I can tell you where I
[1:05:00] went through them because you're the
[1:05:01] only one that goes through it all right
[1:05:03] brother Dale can't stand up here and say
[1:05:05] well you went bro mark back four five
[1:05:07] years ago you went through he can't do
[1:05:10] that right amen it's an individual
[1:05:12] affair with God it's between you and him
[1:05:17] and then you thank God for the
[1:05:19] justification you thank God for the
[1:05:21] sanctification I can walk you right
[1:05:23] through it through Abraham's Journey
[1:05:24] right into my journey and that's what it
[1:05:26] said brother Brown said every son of the
[1:05:27] faith has to take this journey so listen
[1:05:29] if I go from here to California
[1:05:34] that's my journey
[1:05:36] and with my eyes I can see that Journey
[1:05:40] I see all the states I went through all
[1:05:43] the troubles all the trials to get there
[1:05:45] but you can't go through that and
[1:05:48] explain it like I can
[1:05:50] because you weren't there right
[1:05:52] right same way with your experience
[1:05:55] called it through sanctification then
[1:05:58] filled it with the Holy Ghost in Fire
[1:05:59] and he took it through a process
[1:06:03] now how are you going to say you know or
[1:06:05] just believe the message
[1:06:07] the devil believes the message
[1:06:10] better some of us
[1:06:12] and he took it through a process
[1:06:16] because remember folks Judas was
[1:06:18] justified in Sanctified that's right
[1:06:21] had part of the ministry
[1:06:23] exactly look how close
[1:06:26] then he himself that he himself the Holy
[1:06:29] Ghost himself the Son of God could dwell
[1:06:32] in the human heart
[1:06:34] now it has to go through that before
[1:06:38] this is the future home 1964. after the
[1:06:41] seals broke supposedly Brethren changed
[1:06:44] away a new birth it has to go through
[1:06:46] that before he can come into it what
[1:06:51] your heart
[1:06:53] right right
[1:06:54] amen notice he done the world where that
[1:06:57] bride is going to live the same way his
[1:07:00] same Plan of Salvation right
[1:07:04] so the earth goes through justification
[1:07:06] in Noah sanctification when Jesus
[1:07:08] dripped his blood cleansed and claimed
[1:07:10] the Earth amen then it's waiting
[1:07:14] it's got to come on us first it's
[1:07:15] waiting to get his fiery baptism for God
[1:07:19] to come and dwell on the Earth
[1:07:22] the literal Earth
[1:07:23] he's got to come into this Earth First
[1:07:27] all right
[1:07:29] now
[1:07:32] go to the next one
[1:07:35] we're going to go to this is number
[1:07:37] three this is where brother Brown is
[1:07:39] going to explain the Book of Ezekiel
[1:07:43] this is 1956 hitting the Life of Christ
[1:07:45] Minneapolis Minnesota now the Bible said
[1:07:48] that he would give us a new heart right
[1:07:51] right and he would give us a new spirit
[1:07:53] and many people even Pentecostal people
[1:07:56] and Full Gospel people has been deceived
[1:07:59] in that
[1:07:59] many times God said
[1:08:02] I'll give you a new spirit that wasn't
[1:08:05] his Spirit right
[1:08:07] it's your spirit
[1:08:10] then I'll put my spirit in you
[1:08:15] I'll give you a new spirit then I will
[1:08:18] put my spirit in you and many times you
[1:08:20] get the new spirit and think you've got
[1:08:23] the Holy Spirit right
[1:08:26] and trusting upon emotions and signs and
[1:08:29] things when your life doesn't pivy up to
[1:08:33] that now that's just a little raw but
[1:08:35] remember it's the truth paragraph e47
[1:08:38] many people
[1:08:39] that's why brother Brown said you can't
[1:08:41] wait till the door if you got the Holy
[1:08:42] Ghost you can't wait till the doors the
[1:08:43] church opens up now what's the
[1:08:44] difference in that does your life pivot
[1:08:45] up to that
[1:08:47] are you just Sanctified and think you
[1:08:48] got the Holy Ghost
[1:08:51] we make excuses people but one day the
[1:08:54] door is going to be shut and you're
[1:08:56] gonna be left out
[1:08:58] exactly you're going to have that Spirit
[1:09:00] but it ain't gonna be the Holy Spirit
[1:09:01] right and you're going to go through the
[1:09:03] tribulation
[1:09:07] many people
[1:09:08] that spirit that new spirit God had to
[1:09:11] give you a new spirit to get along with
[1:09:13] his Spirit right
[1:09:15] well some people so mean they can't even
[1:09:18] get along with themselves
[1:09:20] Mark was that way
[1:09:25] he come to a journey like I did that's
[1:09:27] all I can
[1:09:29] pick on him
[1:09:30] let alone with God if he'd come in
[1:09:34] if he'd come in
[1:09:37] that's right so doubtful and up and down
[1:09:40] God has to give you a new spirit give
[1:09:43] you a new nature so you can get along
[1:09:45] with his Spirit when it comes right
[1:09:49] amen I hope you see it God gives you a
[1:09:52] new spirit for yourself amen
[1:09:54] and then puts his holy spirit in there
[1:09:58] Amen to dwell with you and abide with
[1:10:01] you everybody okay with that amen
[1:10:04] let's go to number 457 113 what does it
[1:10:08] take to make a Christian Life
[1:10:11] now
[1:10:13] I want you to listen for a few minutes
[1:10:14] before closing I want you to notice one
[1:10:17] thing and watch closely now watch the
[1:10:19] order of the scripture I will take away
[1:10:21] the Stony heart and give you a new heart
[1:10:23] now the heart is the dwelling place of
[1:10:26] the holy spirit amen and I will give you
[1:10:29] a new spirit I want you to watch the
[1:10:31] order right now many people get mixed up
[1:10:34] there
[1:10:35] they think they get the Holy Ghost but
[1:10:37] they just get a new spirit right
[1:10:40] brother Brown says your name goes on the
[1:10:42] book at sanctification as a Believer as
[1:10:45] a church goer right
[1:10:47] right so that ought to mean when you
[1:10:49] start going to churches when you're
[1:10:50] sanctified
[1:10:53] quiet I like it
[1:10:55] they think they get the Holy Ghost but
[1:10:57] they just get a new spirit watch
[1:11:01] I'll give you a new heart and a new
[1:11:03] spirit and then I will put my spirit now
[1:11:06] the new spirit God had to give you a new
[1:11:08] spirit but that's a new spirit God give
[1:11:10] you so you could get along with the Holy
[1:11:13] Ghost
[1:11:14] with that old Spirit you had you
[1:11:17] couldn't get along with your neighbor
[1:11:18] right
[1:11:19] right you couldn't get along with
[1:11:21] yourself right
[1:11:23] so you know you so you know you couldn't
[1:11:25] get along with God
[1:11:28] but look you know what we laugh about
[1:11:30] that but you know God's so gracious he
[1:11:32] does that for us in stages because he
[1:11:34] knows we can't take the Holy Spirit at
[1:11:36] first
[1:11:37] amen he knows us as humans we can't take
[1:11:40] the holy spirit all at one time right
[1:11:43] right A lot of people go crazy doing
[1:11:46] that right but he gives it at stages he
[1:11:48] gives us he softens you know he takes
[1:11:51] the Stony heart out because hey we had
[1:11:53] all had a Stony heart
[1:11:54] so he takes the Stony heart out and then
[1:11:56] he gives us a heart of Flesh and he
[1:11:57] gives us a new spirit so that we can get
[1:11:59] along with your neighbor you can't even
[1:12:01] get along with yourself so you know you
[1:12:03] couldn't get along with God so God gives
[1:12:04] you a new spirit and many times under
[1:12:07] enthusiasm if you watch the life then it
[1:12:09] Bears I hope I'm not hurting but I hope
[1:12:12] I'm uncovering
[1:12:14] right
[1:12:16] see a lot of times you think you have
[1:12:18] the Holy Spirit oh you say I sung I
[1:12:20] spoke in tongues certainly being that
[1:12:23] close to it you might do all of that but
[1:12:26] that isn't the holy spirit yet right
[1:12:28] see the Holy Spirit Bears record of
[1:12:30] Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is the
[1:12:33] word amen amen so you'll do what the
[1:12:36] word says now he taken and what does he
[1:12:39] do give you a new heart give you a new
[1:12:41] spirit then puts his Spirit his spirit
[1:12:44] in you it's just like you don't have to
[1:12:46] go around and pretend you're a Christian
[1:12:48] man that new spirit brings new life amen
[1:12:52] the holy spirit in your new spirit in
[1:12:56] your new heart right
[1:12:59] right same person Gloria
[1:13:01] same Cup right
[1:13:03] right it's not three different cups
[1:13:05] right in one cup we just took one cup
[1:13:07] took it through three stages okay your
[1:13:10] new heart your new spirit and the Holy
[1:13:12] Spirit goes right in the center
[1:13:17] your your heart your new spirit and the
[1:13:21] Holy Spirit
[1:13:22] goes right into the center of your new
[1:13:24] spirit right and your new spirit goes
[1:13:27] right into the center of your new heart
[1:13:28] right
[1:13:29] right it's like the mainspring of a
[1:13:31] famous watch and it's self-winding
[1:13:35] all right it sits right in the middle of
[1:13:37] that new spirit the mainspring of a
[1:13:38] famous watch sits in the middle of the
[1:13:40] watch and makes every organ of that
[1:13:42] watch every instrument just perfectly at
[1:13:45] a time it's all done by main spring in
[1:13:48] the little works out on the side move
[1:13:51] with this mainspring it's the wheel in
[1:13:54] the middle of the wheel
[1:13:55] as Ezekiel say it amen amen you get a
[1:14:00] new spirit
[1:14:03] then he puts his spirit in
[1:14:06] now let's look and see just for a few
[1:14:08] minutes
[1:14:10] at the Statue of a perfect man
[1:14:12] because we all know
[1:14:15] and and some that are watching in may
[1:14:17] not
[1:14:18] but there is a teaching in the
[1:14:20] in the message that you have to receive
[1:14:24] all these virtues before you get the
[1:14:27] holy spirit because you see that Holy
[1:14:28] Spirit right there well now let's go you
[1:14:32] can look it up brother that but let's go
[1:14:34] to Second Peter just for a moment I
[1:14:37] wasn't going to read it but I feel led
[1:14:38] to read it so let's go to Second Peter
[1:14:41] chapter one if they can pull it up
[1:14:43] that's fine if not
[1:14:46] I'm gonna let the Bible explain this
[1:14:49] because watch
[1:14:51] Simon Peter a servant an apostle of
[1:14:53] Jesus Christ to them that have obtained
[1:15:01] now was Peter born again
[1:15:03] was Peter Born Again Peter had the
[1:15:05] divine nature of God Peter was born
[1:15:07] again this is 80 66 30 something years
[1:15:12] after the Holy Ghost fell into that
[1:15:13] Pentecost and Peter was the spokesman
[1:15:15] right so Peter's got the Holy Ghost amen
[1:15:18] amen
[1:15:20] Simon Peter a servant an apostle of
[1:15:22] Jesus Christ to them that have obtained
[1:15:26] light precious Faith with us through the
[1:15:31] righteousness of God and our Savior
[1:15:32] Jesus Christ
[1:15:35] and peace be multiplied unto you through
[1:15:37] the knowledge of God and Jesus our lord
[1:15:40] according as his Divine now
[1:15:43] is Satan divine
[1:15:46] there ain't nothing Divine about that
[1:15:48] dude right nothing nothing Divine don't
[1:15:51] even describe him what does divine
[1:15:54] describe God
[1:15:56] amen Jesus Christ Divine does not even
[1:15:59] describe you
[1:16:01] but if you give the divine nature of God
[1:16:04] right
[1:16:05] right it describes you
[1:16:08] Grace and peace be multiplying you
[1:16:10] through the knowledge of God and Jesus
[1:16:11] our lord according as his divine power
[1:16:14] hath given unto
[1:16:20] us
[1:16:21] all things that pertain unto life and
[1:16:24] godliness that's what I told him
[1:16:25] downstairs when we start with a statue
[1:16:26] of perfect man this is going to talk to
[1:16:28] you about life
[1:16:31] and how to be like God right not just be
[1:16:33] godliness right here
[1:16:38] life life how to live life
[1:16:41] and how to be Godly and live in that
[1:16:43] life right all of a Sunday School
[1:16:45] classes shaking their head because
[1:16:46] they've heard it 67 times
[1:16:49] 67 sermons or sermonettes downstairs we
[1:16:53] are just on the Holy Spirit and brother
[1:16:56] Louise said we I thought we started last
[1:16:58] year February of 2013
[1:17:03] I'm slow people sorry
[1:17:05] do slow according has this divine power
[1:17:09] hath given unto us all things that
[1:17:12] pertain to life and godliness through
[1:17:14] the knowledge of him that has called us
[1:17:16] to glory and virtue so it has to be
[1:17:18] through the knowledge of Jesus Christ
[1:17:19] amen
[1:17:21] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:17:24] great and precious promises that by
[1:17:27] these the prophet said these promises
[1:17:29] you might be putakers of the divine
[1:17:33] nature
[1:17:35] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:17:38] the world through lust right
[1:17:39] divine nature
[1:17:42] not your nature right right his nature
[1:17:47] and besides this right
[1:17:51] right so it's separate
[1:17:52] are you reading scripture with me
[1:17:55] amen and beside this in other words
[1:17:56] beside this
[1:18:00] so this is a new birth correct
[1:18:02] and besides this all right
[1:18:05] giving all diligence add to your faith
[1:18:07] verse reverse your knowledge so you're
[1:18:11] born again at Faith
[1:18:13] baby form Faith you receive the spirit
[1:18:16] of adoption Romans 8 whereby we cry have
[1:18:19] by father you don't receive adoption
[1:18:22] because you're still a baby you're still
[1:18:24] crying crying daddy daddy
[1:18:28] that's what it says
[1:18:30] and that's right here
[1:18:33] that puts you in the body that makes you
[1:18:36] a son
[1:18:38] amen okay then you start living these
[1:18:42] things that these virtues out then God
[1:18:45] chops off your past sins right
[1:18:49] right exactly we sin every day right
[1:18:52] Christians sin every day
[1:18:54] so down here is not Christian
[1:18:57] amen
[1:18:59] if Christians sin every day we're up
[1:19:01] here doing the sinning
[1:19:03] is that all right we're up here doing
[1:19:05] the Senate right
[1:19:07] right so we have to be forgiven that's
[1:19:09] why we say God forgive us of our sins
[1:19:11] and God is what just to forgive us right
[1:19:15] right all right he's not he's not
[1:19:17] stopped forgiving us our sins because we
[1:19:20] have sins
[1:19:22] only Christians have sins all right
[1:19:25] sinner doesn't matter this doesn't
[1:19:26] matter to a sinner you take this and
[1:19:28] give it to a sinner and they just like
[1:19:30] well so what
[1:19:32] you know I mean what does that mean to
[1:19:34] them but to us like the brother says it
[1:19:37] should be the centerpiece
[1:19:40] of our life
[1:19:41] Glory the centerpiece you can't
[1:19:44] understand
[1:19:47] the seals
[1:19:49] without these virtues operating in your
[1:19:51] life right
[1:19:55] actually these virtues were working in
[1:19:58] Peter James John and Paul and they
[1:20:02] didn't understand the seals
[1:20:03] right
[1:20:05] amen so that's kind of what I'm telling
[1:20:07] I've been telling them downstairs that's
[1:20:09] what I said brother Brown didn't come to
[1:20:11] bring us any of this
[1:20:13] this has been 2 000 years
[1:20:15] amen amen not belittling brother Branham
[1:20:18] greatest man says Jesus Christ but he
[1:20:20] did not come to change this or bring us
[1:20:23] this a new doctrine as far as that's
[1:20:24] concerned
[1:20:26] amen
[1:20:27] this is the years of preparation coming
[1:20:31] to the prophet's message which is that
[1:20:34] right there amen amen amen that's the
[1:20:37] prophet's message
[1:20:39] 1963 when the seals broke there is a
[1:20:43] message of the son of man right
[1:20:45] because if that if you could take that
[1:20:47] picture and put it right there there's
[1:20:48] Jesus's head amen he's the head of the
[1:20:51] church
[1:20:52] the body
[1:20:53] but if we're not working right in the
[1:20:56] body
[1:20:56] we either are not in the body or we got
[1:20:59] cracks yeah
[1:21:01] that's why brother Brown Put Holy Spirit
[1:21:04] right here right
[1:21:06] because it seals this together brother
[1:21:08] Brown says weld the only way you can
[1:21:11] weld something is have two pieces
[1:21:16] right
[1:21:17] you can't wear one piece of anything
[1:21:19] right you gotta have two pieces God and
[1:21:21] you right
[1:21:22] you gotta have two pieces weld it
[1:21:25] together right right so add to your
[1:21:28] faith
[1:21:30] add to your new birth
[1:21:33] virtue knowledge temper space is Godless
[1:21:36] brother kindness
[1:21:37] that Holy Spirit right here we've been
[1:21:40] talking about
[1:21:41] is the thing brother Brown said that
[1:21:44] seals it all together
[1:21:46] amen it seals you in
[1:21:51] as
[1:21:53] not just a believer in Christ but it
[1:21:56] makes you to where God can work through
[1:21:58] you better than he can down here right
[1:22:04] right because you know what I was born
[1:22:06] 54 years ago
[1:22:08] into the Dale family
[1:22:11] all right
[1:22:13] I was a son
[1:22:15] but now I didn't realize I was a son and
[1:22:18] what Authority or not Authority are a
[1:22:21] responsibility or not responsibility
[1:22:23] until I reached a certain age right
[1:22:27] and you know what dad and mom didn't
[1:22:29] when I was six years old they didn't say
[1:22:31] you need to be driving son
[1:22:35] maybe a bicycle
[1:22:38] but not a car why they knew my maturity
[1:22:41] level hadn't come to a place where I
[1:22:44] could drive the car yet I had all the
[1:22:46] faculties as I was using Brother Bob for
[1:22:48] an example the other day in in Mobile
[1:22:51] that's where you you come into the line
[1:22:54] of adoption
[1:22:55] you receive the spirit of adoption
[1:22:57] whereby you cry Daddy Daddy but you are
[1:23:00] in the line of adoption but you don't
[1:23:02] reach adoption till you come to maturity
[1:23:05] right
[1:23:12] let's go through all these drop down to
[1:23:14] verse 8.
[1:23:17] because watch what this is going to do
[1:23:19] now remember don't read it yet
[1:23:22] remember when you were born again God
[1:23:24] give you what new heart
[1:23:27] spirit
[1:23:29] and his Spirit right
[1:23:31] a process okay he put us through a
[1:23:33] process of of giving us a soft heart
[1:23:37] giving us a new spirit unclean Spirit
[1:23:39] goes out God gives us a spirit that we
[1:23:42] can contend with him
[1:23:44] and truly become religious because we
[1:23:47] start coming to church we start doing
[1:23:48] things right we start trying to do the
[1:23:50] things of God and then God comes in and
[1:23:54] bursts us into the body as a baby now as
[1:23:56] a baby dad named it at three years old
[1:23:59] they didn't set me up and give me a
[1:24:02] T-bone steak
[1:24:07] how much more heavenly father knows
[1:24:09] exactly what we need at each stage that
[1:24:11] we're still going to make mistakes but
[1:24:13] once we get a little bit closer to the
[1:24:15] top
[1:24:16] someone asked uh down in the Sunday
[1:24:18] school class about is this heading to
[1:24:21] sinless Perfection no
[1:24:24] there's no such thing as sinless
[1:24:26] perfection
[1:24:28] only in God because he's the only sin in
[1:24:30] this one okay but we are heading to a
[1:24:33] place to where as Brother Gary like like
[1:24:36] we talk about the flu
[1:24:39] see Satan can still come in this way
[1:24:41] through memory reason conscious
[1:24:42] affection imagination he can still pack
[1:24:44] those flus full of stuff whirly stuff
[1:24:49] what God's doing I I uh what do you call
[1:24:52] that Donnie when you you backflow
[1:24:54] when you went around you know you
[1:24:56] backflow like a radiator Flows In One
[1:24:58] Direction and it flows through these
[1:25:00] coils and every once in a while those
[1:25:02] coils get stopped up with junk
[1:25:06] so you reverse the process and you
[1:25:08] backflow which means you take the water
[1:25:10] and send it back this way to blow out
[1:25:13] all the stuff that's all right right
[1:25:16] that makes your radiator run better
[1:25:17] because it runs in one cycle one time
[1:25:19] all the time like this
[1:25:21] and when those flus get stopped up you
[1:25:24] just take reverse the process well all
[1:25:26] the flus are getting stopped up with
[1:25:27] Satan coming in this way
[1:25:29] but God's on the inside doing a backflow
[1:25:33] he's but you know what which one wins
[1:25:36] which one wins
[1:25:38] which one wins
[1:25:40] Chief which one wins the one I feed the
[1:25:43] most
[1:25:47] but I like this
[1:25:48] Peter gives us a summation
[1:25:52] this very positive right right
[1:25:56] for if
[1:25:57] big word right there very small word but
[1:26:00] it's huge
[1:26:01] because that's the choice if means a
[1:26:03] choice right all right for if these
[1:26:06] things
[1:26:07] be in you
[1:26:10] and just be there
[1:26:12] abound means to overflow
[1:26:15] if these things be in you and abound
[1:26:18] they make
[1:26:24] so you can read that like this for if
[1:26:25] these things being bound they make you
[1:26:27] that you shall need to be buried or
[1:26:28] unfruitful that sounds good but I like
[1:26:29] to read it like this for if these things
[1:26:31] be in you out of bound they make you
[1:26:33] right
[1:26:35] that right there literally makes you do
[1:26:38] something right
[1:26:39] with all these with all these things in
[1:26:42] you it may it changes your your thought
[1:26:45] process all these are are thought
[1:26:48] processes
[1:26:49] hmm
[1:26:51] look all these are thought you got to
[1:26:53] think about having a temper before you
[1:26:54] have one yeah
[1:26:57] you show I'm quick tempered you can stop
[1:26:59] it
[1:27:00] so you thought of it first right
[1:27:02] right all these are thought processes
[1:27:05] especially that one
[1:27:07] right thought processes these virtues
[1:27:10] for if these things being you and abound
[1:27:12] they make you right
[1:27:14] right that ye shall neither be Barren
[1:27:17] nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our
[1:27:20] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:27:22] but now here is your other
[1:27:25] but he that lacketh these things is
[1:27:30] blind
[1:27:32] and cannot see afar off
[1:27:35] and have forgotten that he was purged
[1:27:38] from his old sins
[1:27:42] wherefore the rather Brethren give
[1:27:43] diligence to make your calling an
[1:27:46] election sure for if you do these things
[1:27:49] ye shall never
[1:27:52] fall
[1:27:55] right pretty positive in it if you do
[1:27:57] these things
[1:27:59] you shall never
[1:28:00] fall
[1:28:03] new heart
[1:28:05] you spirit
[1:28:07] and my spirit
[1:28:09] new heart new spirit my spirit that's
[1:28:12] not your he says add to your faith sure
[1:28:14] but that's the faith of God
[1:28:16] amen this is the virtue of God not just
[1:28:18] the virtue of a man
[1:28:19] this is the knowledge of God the
[1:28:21] temperature of God the patience of God
[1:28:22] the godliness of God the brother the
[1:28:23] countenance of God and brother Bram said
[1:28:24] love which is God
[1:28:26] all right amen so this holy spirit is
[1:28:29] there to to mold this together and give
[1:28:33] it that last
[1:28:34] make
[1:28:37] to me that say when you're born again it
[1:28:41] does make you do different obviously you
[1:28:44] should
[1:28:45] but you still have problems you're a
[1:28:46] baby you make mistakes sure we all did
[1:28:48] that
[1:28:49] but growing up in God those mistakes
[1:28:51] should get less and less
[1:28:54] or we got to work on that more and more
[1:28:57] you know brother Branham what do you do
[1:28:59] if you got to stand your spirit all your
[1:29:01] fasting praying and ask God for us
[1:29:04] he said just give money away
[1:29:08] do the vice versa
[1:29:10] look that word up
[1:29:12] that means do the opposite
[1:29:14] brother Branham I'm stingy give money
[1:29:16] away
[1:29:19] I don't do do the opposite he said boy
[1:29:22] that's pretty powerful
[1:29:24] you'd think you'd go through a whole you
[1:29:25] know find scripture for that he said no
[1:29:27] just
[1:29:29] if you don't have patience
[1:29:32] start trying to have a little bit of
[1:29:33] patience but you know what you can't get
[1:29:34] it on your own
[1:29:36] you can't get it on your own right
[1:29:38] God has got to give you that patience
[1:29:42] above your daily patience
[1:29:46] some of us have patience some people
[1:29:48] have patience some people don't have
[1:29:50] patience
[1:29:51] but that's Godly patience if you'll read
[1:29:53] the statue of a perfect man I love what
[1:29:54] that brother said and I see it more now
[1:29:56] as the centerpiece
[1:29:58] because without the statue of perfect
[1:29:59] man see you most people say well I'm
[1:30:02] going to go through uh the new birth and
[1:30:04] then oh I'm just going to be adopted and
[1:30:06] God's gonna just pour this down on top
[1:30:08] of me and he's gonna pour it down on top
[1:30:10] of you all right
[1:30:11] and I'm gonna you know just I was
[1:30:14] telling them coming up the road uh
[1:30:15] Saturday
[1:30:17] most people in this message two things
[1:30:19] they think God's got a date on the
[1:30:21] calendar and that's when he's coming
[1:30:25] brother Brown said it was the Readiness
[1:30:26] of the Bride
[1:30:27] sure God knows what day that is
[1:30:31] but he ain't got it circled on a
[1:30:32] calendar
[1:30:34] as I'm coming back on this day right
[1:30:36] here but he knows what day it is when me
[1:30:39] and you get ready
[1:30:42] amen
[1:30:44] and he's waiting on us brother I'm still
[1:30:46] waiting on you and I adoption time when
[1:30:49] God can pour in his fullness
[1:30:52] but if we don't come to adoption you can
[1:30:54] forget
[1:30:55] I mean if we don't come to these virtues
[1:30:58] working first
[1:30:59] then God adopts us into the family and
[1:31:02] then we go to the headstone
[1:31:05] we've missed
[1:31:07] the centerpiece
[1:31:09] the piece of the puzzle
[1:31:11] brother Bynum said God had a plan and a
[1:31:14] purpose this is his plan and purpose
[1:31:19] from birth
[1:31:22] to adoption
[1:31:24] as I got older I knew what my position
[1:31:26] was in the Dale family I didn't know it
[1:31:28] was always there
[1:31:30] I was a son
[1:31:33] always the son
[1:31:34] but I had to come to a place to realize
[1:31:39] that
[1:31:40] the Dale family was more than just being
[1:31:42] born in the family it was things that
[1:31:44] you had to uphold and things you had to
[1:31:46] do and think same with you you
[1:31:47] understand that's natural what about
[1:31:49] more with God when you were a baby
[1:31:51] baby form you know God let you make
[1:31:53] mistakes when you get up to there he's
[1:31:56] not going to let you make mistakes right
[1:31:58] if you do he's going to whip you for it
[1:32:01] all right because you're supposed to be
[1:32:02] maturing
[1:32:04] you know they didn't whip me for not
[1:32:05] driving a car at three years old but
[1:32:07] they would probably whip me at 54 for
[1:32:08] not being able to drive a car
[1:32:10] don't say yeah
[1:32:13] because you could do it be quiet
[1:32:16] but God listen
[1:32:18] the way we're raised is the way God
[1:32:20] raises us
[1:32:21] or we couldn't understand it
[1:32:24] new spirit I mean new heart new spirit
[1:32:27] my spirit
[1:32:29] then you start your walk and you do the
[1:32:31] same thing going up the statue of a
[1:32:33] perfect man till you get there to love
[1:32:36] and that's the Capstone of everything
[1:32:39] is love you love the Lord
[1:32:43] God told us
[1:32:45] through brother Branham
[1:32:48] he said
[1:32:50] Watch and Pray
[1:32:52] and that's what we should be doing we
[1:32:55] should be watching let's stand and pray
[1:33:01] new heart
[1:33:03] new spirit
[1:33:05] in my spirit
[1:33:07] amen he gives us the word of God as we
[1:33:09] need it
[1:33:12] he doesn't give it to us before
[1:33:14] and I'll promise you one thing he knows
[1:33:16] whether you can handle it or not
[1:33:19] so he's not going to give it to you you
[1:33:21] know he told them one time he said don't
[1:33:23] cast your Pearls Before Swine we'll see
[1:33:24] God doesn't either God doesn't give you
[1:33:27] godliness
[1:33:29] knowing that you still have free moral
[1:33:31] agency and you're not as Godly as you
[1:33:33] should be do you understand what I'm
[1:33:34] saying he lets you go through a process
[1:33:36] the prophet said so all these are a
[1:33:38] process that we go through from birth
[1:33:42] to adoption
[1:33:45] let's sing a song
[1:33:46] 280 in the Red Bull 280 in the red book
[1:33:49] Let's sing and worship amen draw me near
[1:33:52] Lord
[1:33:53] you have a need Lord
[1:33:57] is here to give you your needs
[1:34:01] to what
[1:34:04] in which book 280 read book
[1:34:07] I'm drawing
[1:34:09] Red Book
[1:34:11] s
[1:34:42] for what you're doing
[1:34:44] and you and God the only person that
[1:34:47] knows that the blessings
[1:35:06] lost
[1:35:34] all right
[1:35:56] nice friend with friends
[1:36:00] you're all we need
[1:36:03] nearer blessing Lord to the cross
[1:36:09] and
[1:36:12] vibrations
[1:36:33] that
[1:36:37] Outreach till I rest in peace with
[1:36:43] the drawing
[1:36:47] us
[1:37:00] till thy precious
[1:37:03] bleeding signs
[1:37:07] before I forget brother Dale's gonna go
[1:37:09] for a stress test tomorrow so let's pray
[1:37:11] for that but I want to you know you
[1:37:13] remember the other night when he was
[1:37:14] talking about how he was
[1:37:16] we were both hunting together and he was
[1:37:18] up in the camper you know and couldn't
[1:37:19] breathe
[1:37:20] well I told him I said you were doing
[1:37:22] that for me
[1:37:23] because I ain't been telling anybody but
[1:37:25] I've had chest pains and couldn't
[1:37:27] breathe for about a month
[1:37:29] um almost passed out several times and
[1:37:32] uh
[1:37:34] after that day it was lifted
[1:37:41] I guess you just had to get both of us
[1:37:43] in the camper together so
[1:37:46] but you know what you can pray for this
[1:37:48] man you know what he Bears your burden
[1:37:51] any bears your sin too
[1:37:54] he does
[1:37:56] and he intercedes he was interceding for
[1:37:58] me and didn't know it right seeing he
[1:38:00] was it was for Brother Gary too
[1:38:02] obviously
[1:38:03] but I was laying there
[1:38:05] and and you know when we went hunting
[1:38:07] that what a couple weeks ago and and you
[1:38:10] know heart was hurting pressure
[1:38:12] pain
[1:38:14] um dizzy
[1:38:16] couldn't breathe
[1:38:19] yeah but I didn't say anything about it
[1:38:20] I just you know I try to pray my way
[1:38:22] through it like a lot of us saw you know
[1:38:24] we try to do brother Dale's taught us
[1:38:25] that because because truly and I don't
[1:38:28] mind you coming up here and being prayed
[1:38:29] for it but brother Brown says you get
[1:38:31] weaker every time you come to the altar
[1:38:32] you got to believe best thing to do is
[1:38:34] just take that thing and say look
[1:38:36] I'm standing on it right here
[1:38:38] right here I'm standing right here
[1:38:40] sure come up one time maybe for prayer
[1:38:42] to get the wheel started right but but
[1:38:45] it's like one of the quotes you know
[1:38:47] it's up and we sure we have up and down
[1:38:50] days sure we're human
[1:38:51] but it but if you come up here for
[1:38:53] prayer for for for a condition of
[1:38:56] whatever your heart
[1:38:57] don't come up here for that again
[1:39:01] it's your faith is what's going to do it
[1:39:03] your faith right now see I wasn't laying
[1:39:07] there praying that Daddy would take on
[1:39:10] my my condition
[1:39:12] I was praying for God to get it off of
[1:39:15] me but he was praying remember he called
[1:39:16] everybody's name so he called the right
[1:39:18] name
[1:39:19] he called my name God connected to that
[1:39:22] and took that thing away from me and
[1:39:24] it's not bothered me since
[1:39:27] so you know you you have confidence in
[1:39:29] God when he was saying that the reason I
[1:39:31] didn't testify I wanted to tell him in
[1:39:32] private you know that night because he
[1:39:35] was he was obviously had a problem but
[1:39:38] now the last time we were down there he
[1:39:39] didn't we were everything was fine
[1:39:41] see that thing had left it that thing
[1:39:43] had come up off of me and got on him
[1:39:46] so he had to pray it off of him to get
[1:39:48] it off to get it off of him
[1:39:50] but he's got a stress test tomorrow so
[1:39:51] just pray that uh that uh
[1:39:55] there'll be no stress
[1:39:57] Why They Call Her stress tests I guess
[1:39:59] because it's got all this stress
[1:40:00] involved you know but you know take the
[1:40:02] Lord at his word amen thank the Lord at
[1:40:05] his word say God you said that if I took
[1:40:08] these virtues and put them in my heart
[1:40:10] that you'd make me
[1:40:14] you would literally make me do things
[1:40:17] that I'd never done before
[1:40:21] and when they abound
[1:40:23] they overflow you remember the you
[1:40:25] remember the dream sister Shepard's
[1:40:27] dream the water was coming up out and
[1:40:30] over overflowing
[1:40:34] right and you know what he said made
[1:40:35] that box stick honey
[1:40:39] and honey represented brotherly kindness
[1:40:42] that's what I told him downstairs that
[1:40:43] is one of the that is why that's where
[1:40:45] it's at because without brotherly
[1:40:48] kindness the love of God's not coming
[1:40:50] right you gotta have love for the
[1:40:52] brother before he can bring that love
[1:40:54] down to you amen
[1:40:56] Even in our inadequacies and our wrongs
[1:40:58] and our in our you know little quirks
[1:41:00] that we have God still wants us to be
[1:41:04] to where he can speak to us
[1:41:06] and he's give us an Avenue away I am the
[1:41:09] way the truth and the life and he gives
[1:41:11] us Shepherds to stand at the door
[1:41:14] not to block the door
[1:41:16] except to let the knock let the devil in
[1:41:18] but it keeps you from roaming around
[1:41:21] I've roamed around before I'm yeah I'm
[1:41:24] honest
[1:41:25] and the shepherd had that's why I like
[1:41:27] them Shepherd hooks they can reach out
[1:41:29] there and they can grab that thing he
[1:41:30] grabs you by the neck most of the time
[1:41:32] and draws you right back in so you know
[1:41:35] you know what God will not lose one son
[1:41:38] he'll not lose one if you're a Son of
[1:41:40] God he'll put you through hell and high
[1:41:42] water
[1:41:45] but if you're a Son of God and you're
[1:41:46] supposed to come to that right there if
[1:41:48] you're supposed to come to love and your
[1:41:50] body get changed without dying
[1:41:55] you gonna be a bruised felon or sister
[1:41:59] from all that but you know what though
[1:42:01] he said he would do it with tender hands
[1:42:04] that's right because they're a nail
[1:42:05] scarred we got to go right back people
[1:42:08] to our Salvation right right you can't
[1:42:10] get away from the Salvation that God
[1:42:12] give you right
[1:42:14] if you get away from that and think
[1:42:15] you're just something because you're in
[1:42:16] this messenger listen let me tell you
[1:42:18] something I told the brethren I
[1:42:20] understood the major doctrines when I
[1:42:22] was 14 years old
[1:42:23] exactly
[1:42:27] exactly right I was lost
[1:42:30] I didn't have a Holy Ghost
[1:42:34] I understood all the money it is just
[1:42:36] the ability to read
[1:42:39] to understand the major doctrines as
[1:42:41] long as long as you get a little bit
[1:42:43] from Brother Branham
[1:42:44] you can read in the word and you can put
[1:42:46] that thing together and not even have
[1:42:48] the Holy Ghost if Judas was part of the
[1:42:51] ministry he must have done something
[1:42:52] without the Holy Ghost cast out Devils
[1:42:55] spoke in tongues
[1:42:59] but the life didn't pivot right as
[1:43:03] brother Branham said to life this thing
[1:43:05] that's why you see these people that are
[1:43:07] going through and dropping off they're
[1:43:09] going through they've went through 30 40
[1:43:11] years and dropping off why they never
[1:43:13] had he never put my spirit right
[1:43:16] it was some of their own Spirit but it
[1:43:18] wasn't the holy spirit that went down
[1:43:21] into that soul and cleaned that man out
[1:43:23] because remember that's your typos
[1:43:26] and if that type post is either Faith or
[1:43:29] doubt
[1:43:31] somewhere down the line that Doubt's
[1:43:33] going to pop up right
[1:43:34] amen
[1:43:36] where there's a preaching of the word or
[1:43:37] whatever there's something's going to
[1:43:39] reveal that or make that manifest it's
[1:43:42] gonna just like just like God's Gonna
[1:43:45] Make You with these virtues he's going
[1:43:46] to make you
[1:43:48] that spirit inside of you if it's of
[1:43:50] doubt it's going to make you go toward
[1:43:52] doubt every time
[1:43:53] then there's nothing we can do about it
[1:43:55] except we just preached the gospel
[1:43:58] and just
[1:44:00] think that everybody's safe
[1:44:02] that's what you got to do you got to
[1:44:04] think everybody's safe but we preach the
[1:44:06] gospel not trying to hurt you but
[1:44:09] but trying to help you right
[1:44:11] it's like brother Dale says it's your
[1:44:13] soul that we're worried about it's that
[1:44:15] Faith or doubt we're working in not the
[1:44:17] memory reason because you can sit there
[1:44:18] and you can reason and have memory and
[1:44:21] conscious affection you can love brother
[1:44:23] Val you can love your pastor or whoever
[1:44:25] you can love these people with regular
[1:44:28] love but is it agape love
[1:44:31] is it the love of God right
[1:44:34] or is it just that you love him because
[1:44:36] he's a nice guy and he don't get on to
[1:44:37] you all the time
[1:44:40] that's why you don't like me because I
[1:44:41] get on to you all the time but that's
[1:44:43] okay I can take that as long as I see
[1:44:45] your soul saved I really don't care
[1:44:46] whether you like me or not on this side
[1:44:49] but you will over there right
[1:44:51] and I won't say I told you so over there
[1:44:53] I promise I won't I will not say I told
[1:44:56] you so never you know that's one thing
