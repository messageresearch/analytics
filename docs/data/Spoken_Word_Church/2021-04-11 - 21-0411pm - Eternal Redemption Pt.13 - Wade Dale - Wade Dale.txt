house with lord good to be back with the home folks we had a real good time in arizona we had some real good fellowship real good friendship we happened to uh brother andrew glover was out there and so was uh brother dale smith of course he's got a church out there but we all got together on saturday and had a little fellowship and sister mandy cole well she's mandy clayton now we've known her 20 something years she lives out there so we got to all get together and have a little fellowship but brother chris said tell each and every one of you hello and god bless you i told him i said it's a real pleasure to be able to to preach to a group of people that understood what you were saying because they had a good background they had a good they had a good preacher that could uh rightly divide the word but there were there were about what jim four five six knew what six or seven new seven new converts that had came with them from colorado springs the old church where chris used to be and and so we got to give them a little bit of testimony of the word of god and how the god sent a prophet and and i told uh bob is miracles happened in arizona because i second service first service you know i preached a little while and we got pizza and and sub sandwiches and went outside in 90 degree weather and sat outside and eat pizza and and um drank some coca-colas and then we went right back in and had service and i preached for two and a half hours and not one person went to sleep yeah so it's just all on what you want because you can have the reason i'm saying that is we put ourselves in the same situation we blame it on eating i don't you can blame it or whatever you want to blame it on but um but it's just in what you wanted because man they were sitting on the edge of the seat especially the new ones it's good to preach the new ones every once in a while because you do get older and you know you get more settled and you get more ah man instead i'm in you know but uh to see the young younger ones come in and then you know you bring a thought out and then you see their eyes you know their eyes light up and and then afterwards you you see the you see the effect of that now they were still i mean they were still there with their earrings on and their pants on and all that didn't bother me i wasn't talking to the outside person and talking to the inside guy anyway so but that's the same way with anywhere you go and we sure appreciate brother chris for letting us have that uh have that time and and then we flew back on tuesday we had a day of rest on monday so it was wonderful we had a good time saw the sun come up in flagstaff at six o'clock tuesday morning and took a picture of the sun going down in greenville south carolina tuesday evening so we flew all the way across the country watch the sun come up and watch the sun go down but good to be back here good to be back with the home folks so if you got your bibles let's go ahead and continue with hebrews 9. we'll bring a little bit of extra thought maybe today and background a little bit since we hadn't uh this has been a couple of weeks so also remember this week this wednesday i'll be speaking also also remember as brother terrence is talking may the first we're going to have bible study may the second we'll have sunday school i've already spoke to a couple of sunday school class teachers i need to get with uh anna and uh y'all didn't take communion last sunday that was the first sunday so we'll we'll try to do that on that weekend of may we'll stack our whole weekend up bible study sunday school class and then we'll take communion we might have some preaching in between a little bit of that a little bit maybe but just remember also to put on your calendars june the 16th through the 19th the father's day fishing trip in helen brother chris long and brother ronnie long will be there with us also remember july our july our 50th anniversary meeting will be july the 3rd and 4th but the jewel forney and brother mike oltea will be speaking for us there so we're really looking forward to that and then like i said next sunday afternoon after second service we'll have cake and ice cream for the for the uh 81 year old coming up so um you know as jun turned 60 yesterday and i told him we were i went to work sunday morning saturday morning i went to work and i said i've done something never done before they said what i said i kissed a 60 year old woman they didn't get it for a second so but uh i told you and i said i said well now you know they you do surveys and they put you in these little brackets you know 35 to 45 45 to 55 55 well we moved over into another bracket we're in our 60s i don't know what i don't they didn't even do one for 80s and i don't know what they do in 80 or 80. survival mode that's what it's a survival mode for all of us so um we are brother chris also said to pray for him he's he's got some um not he's just old getting older the man was a motorcycle rider for his profession back when he was younger he broke every bone in his body almost he said so just remember brother chris he has a hard time getting up and a hard time moving around so just pray for him but hebrews 9 verse 11 we're still on eternal redemption but right here at the at the end we want to bring a few things out that we saw when brother louise did a masterful job wednesday night of speaking on uh why hell was not eternal i was i was hoping that that title what they call it click bait in the in in the youtube world you know you see that title and you think man that thing's going to get 5 000 views because everybody believes hell's eternal except for the bride of jesus christ you know everybody all there's nothing but it's getting up there pretty good so maybe they'll maybe somebody will watch it and and get something out of it but it was a it was a you can't wiggle out of that one and when you bring it right you can't wiggle it you can't say well this no you bring all the angles that's why i love teaching and i love how that like brother dale said it positionally places you in the body and i'll read something about perfect love here in just a little while that brother brown told us so hebrews 9 remember all these ones that are sick the ones that are not with us and uh we pray that they'll all be back together we'll get them back together here and uh remember uh sister sharon snart she's been on my heart for a while so remember her she's going through she's been going through a battle for a long time but she's going through a battle now too so just she's just one of us so hebrews 9 verse 11. dear heavenly father thank you for this day that you give us lord this is a trying hour for the world but lord it should be a grand and glorious hour for your bride because we see the word being opened in more we see more avenues of of revelation that's coming from different angles lord but it's all bringing us to this one purpose is this plan of redemption that goes to the change of the body for the gentiles and then continues right on to the jews and then continues right on to the white throne judgment father we pray that you'd give us strength today lord bless each one that's here be with the ones that are not here the ones that are online lord we pray that you'll just be with each one give us lord today our daily bread be with the ones lord that we pray for the ones that list right down below my feet hanging on the wall lord for salvation lord for the ones that we go through lord for the older ones here our church lord and the different ones around the country we pray lord brother george smith shall raise him up for your honor and glory lord brother ray hear a good report today father we pray that you just bless each one take care of us now and further in this service in jesus name we pray amen hebrews 9 11 but christ being come a high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building so he did away with that when he went to calvary right because it had to be done in flesh you cannot redeem through a building you can't redeem through a tape player amen you have to have redemption through human flesh it has to be as brother there was something heirs and joined heirs that's what we were talking about it brother chris is when you take joint heirs see if if men if well i want to say daddy's going to pass away but if somebody passes away and you got three people there if they're joined heirs this one doesn't get 10 000. this one doesn't get a thousand and this one gets nothing joint heirs means whatever that's left whatever's there right you get an equal opportunity to have exactly what that heir and we are heirs of god and join heirs with christ and what was he heir of heir of salvation he actually obtained eternal redemption for us so in that he obtained eternal redemption it's ours that way in john 17 jesus did he didn't pray that we would be too he prayed that we would be one amen to me that's the greatest revelation that we're going to have to break into break out of this god's way up yonder and we can't get to him and and we're not worthy well i'm just going to tell you what the bible says we're heirs and joiners with christ where is he sitting today he's sitting what in um he's in a seventh dimension with a perfect body so what are we heading to the only problem is is we got to have that perfection down here get the dead saints out of the ground get that perfection here because what the bible says thessalonians tells us we which are alive and remain shall be caught up so that's what we need to work on now this i'm not just trying to go over and over this is a plan that's got to be carried out and it's got to be carried out to the t because god made the plan he saw the plan that he made and it was perfect so it's why he called it eternal neither by the by the blood of goats and cows but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having what obtained when he came out of that tomb on resurrection morning he obtained eternal redemption for me and you because his body was not eternal when they hung him on a cross but he obtained eternal redemption for us you may be seated we're going to go over this real quick we won't be long today job the oldest book in the bible supposed to be written before moses redemption was the oldest things in the bible now why did he why did god god foreseeing that he knew we would fall he knew that we would need a savior to save us from the get-go so he knew that adam would need it eve would need it abel would need it they all would need a plan of redemption before there even was a breath on the earth of a human being amen because now remember let's i haven't brought this out but let's let's bring this out because the earth the earth fell because we fell brother dale read it this morning in romans 8 the whole world groaneth and waited for the manifestation of the sons of god because when adam fell that brought everything down below him to the fall it wasn't the earth's fault the earth was created perfect amen the animals were created perfect the animals were supposed to they were here before we got here and they were multiplying and they were doing the things that they were to do and and you know they were being and i was watching i downloaded a little video about a a girl that was um epileptic and it made me cry because yeah i can it made me cry because they take these little dogs from puppies now i talk about nature that's when brother dale because the bible says that we were we were brought under that see before the fall adam those dogs didn't need to be trained they were already trained to do what adam told it to do but after the fall they began to get angry and they began to get started eating each other and all these different things but now man through even just through the tree of knowledge he is able to bring these little puppies and and be able to emulate an epileptic fit and the dog can sense it before the kid has the epileptic fit by smell it gives off a certain odor and they've trained it now and you do and the reason i was crying i thought lord that's the way it should have been there's no way no epilepsy but that's the way it was when adam was walking around he didn't have to tell the dog what to do the dog they everything was in harmony everything was in perfect love and was in connection with each other and even the line and the lamb laid down with each other and all these different things but look what man has done just by sheer knowledge of the tree of knowledge still being the the highest in the food chain he can train a dog that can go home with this little girl because she'd have epileptic fits and quit breathing they happened to catch her one time before she passed away so now there's dogs with her all the time and she had a fit there and that the dog just starts barking going crazy jumping up and down on so it alerts it by the smell i thought my if man can do that in this natural what about in the spiritual where we don't need all that training of an animal that the animal would just know what to do because the lion and the lamb you lay them down together now and one of them's going to die but if you lay them down together back in before time before there was a fall what were they doing they were they were in harmony with each other they were just animals there was no food chain going on there so but you look at those things and you think god that's why the bible says we're groaning that's what's groaning within us that's what's groaning within the animals that's what's grown you see the volcanoes going off um af i mean uh uh alaska just had another earthquake five point something on the richter scale and then you got one island it's got a volcano every time i see these things and all these disasters it's our fault it's our fault because you said no it's adam's fall well it's our fault because we haven't got it back to the we ain't got the ship pulled back together yet we ain't got but we've got the way to do that right that's why i was explaining to them out in arizona that's why god had to send a prophet because they had all these pieces laying out there was the pieces and you just look at pieces and you go why how in the world like like richard and dad were you know laying the pieces out for that motor what that wouldn't have meant one thing to me but you take a master um a master mechanic can look at that and say oh there's a cylinder there's a there that bolt goes next to that cylinder because it's this you see what so god had to send us a profit they took all these pieces or all these loose ends and what he built the ship that's going to take us out of here he's built that thing that you and i are going to have to attach ourselves to that so this is not just talking about eternal redemption just because we want to go over and over it no there's something in here that's going to have to click somewhere to take us to a change of the body because it's never happened before so the psyche of of of humanity how many people have you had heard of change of the body like you said if you ask them about it in the denominational world what do you think is going to happen they'll have an answer they don't have an answer what do you mean changing the body we're getting a new one we went to that church that guy a little baptist guy up in the mountains and he got finished preaching went outside smoking like you wouldn't believe and they said brother said he's coughing he said brother they said brother you're going to kill yourself he said i'm going to get me a new body it ain't going to matter what i do with this one see there so there's their teaching that and this was from a preacher this is from a head of a church that was preaching to his congregation so if he could do it the congregation could do it that's why brother branham tells us it's misinterpreted theology it's what's got us in the trouble that we're in misinterpreted theology is letting us do the things that we do our misinterpreted theology but thank god let me tell you something you've been put into a place that there is no misinterpreted theology this message has not yeah it's been misinterpreted by the people out there but when god brought it to the prophet and he brought it to us it was not misinterpreted it was the word of god brought a sounding board through a prophet that brought us the message and then you and i have got one thing to do and that's believe it get into it believe it know that it's right know that you're in the right place to get it i was thinking when bob was preaching why pentecost failed you can't preach that everywhere buddy there's a lot of people in this message still stuck in pentecost and when you tell them that's why they failed you won't do it but one time you'd be like me you'll be that one and done guys but you know what it's not our fault we're trying to bring the truth to the people we're trying to bring the truth to the people and if they reject it then you know what it's going to be on them it's not going to be on us it's going to be on them same thing with you if you hear brother dale years and years and years preaching over and over again and you reject it then i don't i ain't saying let's go to ephesians 1. but redemption was the plan of redemption was late this thing was laid out and remember there had to be a group of people take this plan of redemption and work it do it you had to be able to connect yourself to this plan of redemption we see in ephesians that and let's go to verse four according as he has chosen us in him we know what that is that he chose us in him before the foundation of the world now how did he do that he didn't do that just by saying all right i'm going to take zach black but i'm not going to take samuel l no he by foreknowledge he knew that zach would come to a place that he was tired of being tired sick and tired of being sick and tired of his stinking thinking and he would want god more than anything in the world amen so according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love remember not pulling us to a tube we had some good conversations out there in arizona it would have been good to tape them but we didn't but but you look at that and you see that that what honor is it more instead of just saying all right you're my son and that's it it's done where is there a victory where is there an overcoming where is there a struggle where is there a pop of god where are you you know god saved me god god healed me and all these different things you know that to me that brings everything and i know sin is horrible right being sick is horrible but my when you get well and my when you come from a sinner to a saint and you realize that god saved your soul and take you out of that pit of hell and put you up into a higher place and that you can think different and act different and things like that doesn't bother you anymore what more do we look to god and say thank you papa god because i couldn't do that myself see everybody there's a lot of people though in this world that think they do that all their by theirself all these great people all these great people of the world even world leaders if they're not born again they're going to stand before that white throne of judgment just like the guy that didn't have anything in the world they're going to all stand there and have to give an account of what they did with what god gave them accordance has chosen up in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding without blame before him in love we're going to talk about that word love just for a little bit in a minute having predestinated us that's what brother dale's been preaching on even brother chris has been preaching so it must be that we need to preach a little predestination and it not being that having predestinated what us unto the adoption as we were talking the other day you know luther was predestinated to to a spot but it wasn't to it wasn't the full adoption each person has been given even paul paul's age the ephesian church this is who he's talking to the ephesians now one of the most powerful churches there was and 12 people went to that church amen but they could understand this because paul had brought them to a place you and i have been brought to a place but remember because of the opening of the word they were there was a lot of things withheld down through the ages now not the perfect love because remember we we're going to get to it perfect love cast out fear and perfect love is the new birth so they all had the new birth for their age but that perfect love didn't carry them all the way because there was a group of people listen we all have to we were talking about this in arizona there there's and the same thing here i brought the quote i didn't bring it with me where brother brown talks about that box god's got a box and then you if ephesians church age they fulfilled what that was inside that box then he laid them away and brought in the iranians church irenaeus martin columba each one of them had a message and they're in that sixth dimension under their messenger right but not one of them sure they were a voice columba had to have a voice because he died before the church age started so he brought his message and then a voice through a group of people but nobody has ever been commissioned to bring the final voice to the final age under her messenger now under each messenger they brought a voice but it wasn't final it was a continuation it was a growth development it was baby form then it went to you know went to milk and then it went to to uh baby food and then a little bit of hard food and then meat so you and i are living in the meat age so listen that's our requirement right do you know luther if we brought luther's box and put it out here in this age that wouldn't do you any good except just say it would justify you wouldn't put you in the body of christ but now it put them in the body now everybody understand that because that won't you have to go to the next step and then go to the next step because it's a requirement think about all these others you know you couldn't even i was thinking yesterday or yeah a couple days ago martin i don't think martin stood up and said bless god i'm the third church age messenger to pergamos no he come and brought a message each one of them come and brought a message i don't even think luther stood up and said well i must be a no it took a profit in the end time so that we can take these quotations from the prophet and say oh that's why luther acted like he did that's why wesley acted like he did this is how we're supposed to act why pentecost failed is because they cabbage down and got stuck in a church age they had the holy ghost but they thought that was a complete part and that i was thinking about this brother dale was in um out there where i was at pretty much pretty close and in colorado and we were out there hunting and i wasn't serving the lord this is probably 1995. and there was two preachers that went with him well one had the cabin and the other one went brother down they were sitting at the table now of course i was over in the corner listening but and i knew what dad believed but this one was saying you got it all when you believed and this was saying you didn't get nothing until you get up to the top where it says holy spirit and they're sitting there arguing back and forth and daddy's trying to bring them together you know how brother brown took the tree off of the trinity and tree off the oneness and stuck in the ground he was trying to stick a tree in that big old table we were sitting at didn't do any good didn't change their mind but they were all they all had points that they were quoting each other back and forth but you got to bring that together you've got to have the holy ghost before you can have holy ghost virtues it just makes sense and then you read the bible where it says having the divine nature of god right you got to have the divine nature of god to know what god wants you got to be a child to god for you not listen the devil's kids don't have these traits oh yeah you brother brown said some of these people have natural but that ain't spiritual traits like this is spiritual traits coming from our daddy coming from our genetics you become a born-again believer you're not your natural genetics but that that kuckelberg turns into a wheat that inside man is then the one the control man that says okay you need to have virtue not just be a virgin listen to don't they don't anymore but being a virgin was a um in the bible you had to be one or they take you out and kill you right but that pretty much has eroded itself all the way down to the end time okay but did god change no he didn't change but that virtue is not living a virtuous life that virtue we know is strength or power and so that's what you and i must look at right here in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace that's number seven try to flip through here real quick number first nine having made known unto us the mystery of his will there was a certain mystery went out in all the church ages but you and i as i was telling them that sunday you know you take the analogy of the book jesus in luke 4 he sets down and they hand him a book or scroll in luke 4 and he sets down and he what does he do he identifies himself in the word because the book's open but now before he gets up to leave what does he do the bible says he closes the book and hands it back to the preachers and so liv they lived under a closed book because he went right on you know a couple years from there he went to calvary and died he tried to show him the open book but it disappeared oh yeah people got saved sanctified filled with the holy ghost all down to the church ages but it was still i see through a glass darkly i don't see all things i don't see how the as i said many times before as great as paul was paul never knew what a seal was now he knew the seal of redemption he knew the seal you know whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption but as far as the seven seals paul never heard anything anybody preach on seven seals that was all given to john 20 years or 30 years after paul had already went off the scene and even john lived through it tried to write it the best that god let him write it and then he what he gave it back but now remember in in revelations 10 what did that angel come back with that angel came back with an open book somewhere along the line that thing got opened back up and it had to be a seventh angel messenger to reveal what this mystery the mystery of his will what did he say the mystery of his will was was to adopt us now not just come to baby form adoption because everybody and i i was i was going to tell brother they'll finish up to this afternoon or keep going because there's more to that because you receive the spirit of adoption where you cry you cry daddy daddy your baby you're crying and that's okay that's all right because you know what god's a good daddy but now he does require us to grow up i don't call brother dale every 15 minutes now i need some i need something yeah that'd be funny wouldn't it i'm 61 years old you know what he'd say grow up for some of you wake up no he's saying grow up well that's what god's doing now he's telling us to wake up i've said before and i'll tell you again wait that thing up that's inside you and use it we have we have encapsulated that thing so long until i can and i won't and i'm not this and i'm not that quit that let that thing inside of you out let it do something come on let it out of that cocoon you'll be a beautiful butterfly if you can't but you know what happens they have to fight their way out that little worm it it solidifies on the outside but you know what happens that thing inside of it that butterfly starts doing this then little bees that come out of my in my hive they they're it's capped over with a little bit a little thin layer of of wax but you know what the workers don't help them out and workers walk right over the top of them bees trying to come out of the hole why because that bee gets stronger as it's chewing its way out of that out of that nest or out of that little circle that they're in or hexagon that they're in and they chew themselves out and then they come out and they say oh man that was a struggle but i'm alive that's the same way with you and i it's a struggle but we're alive it's a struggle but we got eternal life we should be the happiest people we i mean you see people happy at ball games and all these different things you see people happy they win the lottery they get happy they get happy because they got their stimulus checked first before anybody else did lord of mercy people call in the post office all the time now you got my stimulus checks like we hold them for something i don't we don't hold them for nothing we get them things out as fast as we can get them out folks i'm promising it's not all the postal people's fault you get them out we get them out as we get them all right but you know that people are happy when they get that 1400 i will be when i get mine because i've already got it spent but what about god though that's just 1400 you know what it'll go away in about five minutes once i get it nah two minutes because i already got it spent but now you can't do that with god you can't say oh i'll just use a little bit of this because there's nothing left the more you want the more he gives the more you get the more he gives the more you want amen and it's an inexhaustible fountain but in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together and won all things in christ and as i said before i'm not trying to be an exclusionist or or as brother brown says a segregationalist but god's a segregationist he segregates good from evil he segregates us from the church he said i now call you bride you must act like bride don't act like church there is a difference it took a profit to bring the difference though that way you could see a lot of times when when you see the prophet talking about he will exchange church and bribe but you look after the seals open he pretty much hones in and he tells you what that bride is it's not that denominational church it's not that idea that's out there in the world it's one specific group because look that in the dispensation the fullness of times he might together gather together what in one all things in christ both which are in heaven which are on earth even in him and him also we have obtained an inheritance so we didn't come here with one right we didn't come here with one we have to obtain it we had to fight our way out we had to fight our way to that birth amen it didn't just come because we were born naturally on this earth no you were born naturally on this earth to die you were born naturally on this earth to die right because that's what god told them back in the garden you're in sorrow you're going to bring forth children and they're not going to live he put a time limit on some of them 120 years he didn't give that to us though being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will and we we've been through four knowledge we'll skip through that but we know that romans 8 28 for whom he did for know he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son listen predestination sure it is determined that there's going to be a group of people here that's going to take this message and take a body change so that is predetermined you got to decide whether because see god knew god knows he's going to be there you don't so i and you know what i like it that way because you know what if if zach if you'd have woke up one day and just said well i know i'm going to heaven i don't know we're human beings it's like brother brown said he said if you knew god was coming tomorrow he said continue to plant your potatoes get married build a house do all the things don't just sit down and go well i made it well no you need to press i think paul said press he said press on to this mark of the high calling not just a level calling or or just well i'm a christian and and and i make it to church sometimes no it's a pressure that we're and you know what we're built for it we're built for this pressure if not we'd be in another church age we were built for the pressure of this age because we are astronauts we are eagles we are made to go higher we're higher than any animal that's ever come line ox man or eagle the eagles the highest it can take the pressure and like somebody i think it was in one of the songs and let me give you a little brother joe canada bless his heart for those of you that are on the email he does something that's really that will help you because when we do these new songs a lot of y'all don't sing them you know why because you don't know the tune but brother joe canada if you will open your email hello somebody if you'll open your email he's giving you a link to the song you can hear the song being sung by someone else and you can get that and enter in maybe and do more worshiping instead of trying to figure out what the words are amen so thank god for brother joe he's not doing that for himself he's doing that for me and you so that we can worship and sing and not have to be focused continually on the words or how the or how the uh the song goes but he sent that one yesterday and i really enjoyed it i was playing it this morning before service so you kind of understand how to how to sing the song what i'm what am i saying is god giveth the ability with all this technology even with the fourth dimension that we've been talking about that's so bad it is to the devil but god uses it too he sends his his technology i like god's technology it's been you know we god didn't need to stick a wire in anything never has never has to have an antenna never had never runs out of wi-fi never runs out or out of signal never runs out he doesn't ever have to reboot he's been using this forever he's just god has let man tap into it so me and you can put the whole message now on something about this big so you don't have an excuse you know we had an excuse when when we first had this building and for those of you that that i wish i hope if anybody's got any pictures of the old church or anything of the building in the old church we need to bring them for our 50th anniversary because this whole wall right here there was not a door there the door was right here going outside there was two windows here and the seats were this way and the wall was right there where brother donny is at and it went back a little bit but that was the whole church pulpit was right here piano was right here but this whole wall was full of tapes seven inch reel if you wanted to if you want to check out three or four tapes it almost took a box to carry them out just three or four tapes right when dad threw them all the way it was a whole pickup full but you know what you can do you can get the whole sermon on a little mini disc a little mini disc about that big stick it into whatever you need to stick it into and play it in your pocket all 1100 sermons so you don't have an excuse i didn't hear that sermon or that one i couldn't find that one it's all right here so she even got through the fourth dimension he took all excuses away for you not being able to listen to the to the message of the hour or even listen to the sermons that are here if you're not here amen for whom he did for no he also did pre be did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren now being the firstborn what happens you have a first born and then you have born after that amen but he was the firstborn or the first partaker brother they'll get into that with adoption because somebody has to be the example because it's not normal for us to act like god sorry we're born contrary we're born with a carnal mind we're born what contrary to anything god said because that's what you live before you got the new birth you live contrary to what god said so that's the way don't be surprised just realize that that part's gone now i hope that part's been put in the sea of god's forgetfulness that he won't remember it no more i wish my brain sometimes would be thrown into that place so i don't have to remember this but you know what you remember it for a reason it keeps you humble it keeps you away from that other stuff that you used to do it keeps you from getting so close remember satan owns the fence so let's don't get to where the fence is at amen satan owns the fence so be careful stay away from it moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called he justified he justified he glorified that's me and you he called us in this end time look what he'd done like brother dale said look at all the people from all the different places of the country how he brought us all together and put us under one roof and put us under one message that we can hear what hear the voice of god not only through press and play but through a five-fold ministry because it takes a five-fold ministry to perfect the saints as i said before you might get born again listening to a tape or reading a book that's fine but listen how in the world like i said that was my point i was gonna make how are you going to if you're called and justified and glorified you have to have a way for that to happen but you got to open up yourself to get that there's got to be a way you can't just listen to the tapes because that's contrary to the word of god it's got to be a live ministry it's got to be a live apostles prophet pastor teaching an evangelist to what to get you through this adoption stage the stage of adoption has to come through preaching of the word of god an updated revelation a 2021 not different from 1963 or 64 or 65 not different thank god for a prophet that when he preached he preached both ways he preached all the way back and he preached all the way into the future home but let's listen to this how can i take a cucker bird number two and make a greater weed out of it it's impossible for me to do it the only way it could be is because inside that kookaburra has been transmitted from a kookaburra to a germ called wheat germ remember god's the only one that can do that they'll be all right with that listen so now let's go to the dimensions i wrote myself a little note light time and matter is the first three dimensions i'm kind of skipping through this a little bit to get to my point light time and matter now listen we are trapped in this time we're time creatures okay sorry we're time creatures all right and we have to have light sunlight to live off of natural sunlight everybody got that i'm talking natural right now you've got to have natural sunlight to grow the plants and to keep the animals and to grow the animals and grow the plants and them to eat the plants and you'd eat them and then for you to get strong you need light you need regular sunlight so god give us that in the first three dimensions light he gave us time so that we and being timed creatures we had to be because he had to slow that he had to slow those dimensions down so that there could be other ones right that's right everybody got that think of this perfect plan he knew he would need a fourth dimension he knew you need a fifth dimension that was a little bit faster a six dimension it was a little bit faster and a seventh dimension but he knew that time had to come into being because he'd say you're only going to live 120 years man's number or what he's going to live with 120 years and now down to 70 for us and then matter he knew that you know as as before all this as adam was in spirit form he didn't need light remember genesis 126 man was created before anything was created we know that on the sixth day that he was put in the flesh but that genesis 21 26 man was way before the foundation of the world that's when this plant listen without that genesis 1 26 man there is no plan of redemption because that is the redeemed that's not just everybody that just wanders all over the world that's the redeemed that's the ones that are going to be considered what does the prophet tell us he said only what only sons and daughters of god are considered in redemption nobody else is oh there's some that's going to be attached to it but you and i are the only ones this bible was written for why do you think god took so much time and kept all these books the way they're supposed to be psalms and job and all these different ones why do you think he took he was so careful because he knew that human beings would need this and that the bride wouldn't need it need it because his brother dale's talking about if you call it this morning those that were under the law was not under that genesis 1 26 man that one part of genesis 1 26 man because when jesus came now remember he came to magnify the law but for the ones for the ones that for righteousness sake he didn't do away with the law but he came under the law to deliver us from what the effects of the do's and the don'ts amen because he doesn't want his real children his real children once they yeah sure they're babies and we smack them we get a little brother brown said protoplasmic whatever that is stimulation but once we get a little bit older god expects us just to do the right thing thou shalt not kill do we have to get up every sermon and preach not to kill do we have to get up every sermon preach don't covet your neighbor i mean that's really what listen that's really what the denomination the world doing they're preaching the old testament thou shalt not but you know they're sitting there not doing all what the word says but you know let's be good to your neighbor thou shalt not do this don't do that do this don't do that but remember when we come down and adam he didn't have to have sunlight to exist he wasn't in time and as i've said before adam just moved through the earth he walked through that wall if he needed to i believe because he wasn't in human flesh he was in his theophany and theophanies are the same way you don't have to open the door to let a theophany outside no it just goes right through the wall because it comes from this hard shell thing that's caught in light and time and matter because god knew once he put us in human flesh we would need light and time and matter because we can't we got to have something hard how in the world are you going to get in the car and go down the road today go home you get in the car where you're in theophany and you just go out the other side you need something hard right so we need something hard something to beat on maybe you wouldn't have nothing to beat on chris has got this big old new pulpit and i was banging on it and he said i didn't know if it take that or not but i guess it will so i said it at home it keeps people awake it hurts my hand so look the fourth dimension we know what that is but let's go to the fifth dimension where brother louise was that because the fifth dimension is where the center of the unbeliever dies and goes to number five it's kind of well the horrible dimension and like brother louise said it's a real he did a real good job just a outstanding job and truly you got to remember folks hell was not created for human beings to be there hell was created for the devil and his angels all right so we look we we're through the fourth dimension into the fifth dimension and that's the holding place then we go to the sixth dimension and we know the sixth dimension is christ the saints the dead saints because i want to i want to actually while he was preaching that going to the sixth dimension if you don't mind while he was preaching that i thought a few things i want to bring out today but look it says the sixth dimension is christ the saints the dead saints are resting saints who is completely worked finished on earth and has entered into rest with christ under the altar beautifully you could parallel it like a beautiful dream that you didn't want to wake up from now the one brother louise was talking about wednesday you want to wake up from that one but you can't but remember brother brown said it ain't a dream it's natural it's real i'm just making a parable and then of course the seventh dimension is god alone and i came upon something how many times have we read the bible and we didn't read the bible you know we were talking the other day and i was preaching on paradise and i said that i didn't believe that they i didn't believe that they were changed back to young people until the resurrection and i got a scripture for that you ever read it before let's go to first samuel 28. now we know that paradise was what paradise was a holding place called the bosom of abraham yeah go the first all the way to first samuel we're going to skip a bunch of quotes here because you've heard them before because remember what was paradise drop back down to yeah go one more go to first samuel 28 it's right below that one there you go because remember what was paradise paradise i want you to understand this this is how powerful the blood of jesus christ is and how imperfect the blood of bulls and goats was now the blood of bulls and goats what did it do for this space of time it covered the people everybody got that but that was only showing that there was a time come that a man was going to come a man was going to die and that man had enough power inside of him enough of the soul of god which he was god that he could come back and go not on to the believer but inside the believer and he could wash your sins away and do away because the blood of bulls and goats it only covered or capoed your sin but we were talking about paradise that that we see that brother brown said john was there abraham was there isaac was there jacob was there sarah was there but watch this in first samuel then said to woman who shall i bring up and he said bring me up samuel remember samuel had been dead for two years and he was in where he was not in the sixth dimension he was in paradise everybody got that right and paradise was the holding place i'm sure it was a wonderful place to be i'm sure they were probably not unhealthy they were not hurting in any way but there was no way for them to be changed back to a young man and woman watch this and when the woman saw samuel she cried with a loud voice now this is where who saul came to the witch of endor the winch of endor did some kind of hocus pocus or whatever she did went to the spirit world she did something amen when a woman saw samuel she cried with a loud voice and the woman spake the sauce saying why hast thou deceived me for thou art saul and the king said unto her be not afraid for what saw us thou and the woman said saul i saw god's ascending out of the earth and he said unto her what form is he of and she said an old man cometh up had you ever read that before i read it a hundred times and never read that part right there he didn't say a young man they didn't say an unrecognizable person the bible says an old man cometh up and he is covered with a mantle who'd stumble samuel so what happened when they died they just moved over into another dimension the same age they must have passed away with because listen the blood of bulls and goats only covered your sin but now look at the difference in the paradise and the sixth dimension we're fixing to talk about because the 90-year-old woman got the baptism of the holy ghost in this dimension and when brother brown met her in the other dimension she was a 20 year old young woman there was not age differences in the sixth dimension and he said unto her what form is he and she said an old man cometh up and he is covered with a mantle and saul perceived that it was samuel and he stooped with his face to the ground and bowed himself and we know the rest of the story samuel tells him still being a prophet brother brown said he said tomorrow he said the lord has departed from you and tomorrow you and your son will be with me in paradise amen but an old man cometh up so i really thought that was pretty neat because i i i just i just took that in myself that that's what happened but then i went back and read the scripture again and there it says an old man cometh up so they didn't change as much as we change because like i said before jesus christ hadn't died so they were just covered everything was just what brother brown said paradise was a holding place not a rejuvenated place not a wonderful place not a place you don't want to ever go to i mean you that you always want to go and don't want to come back it's a holding place so he put him in a holding place to hold him there until he died at calvary and then he what the old testament saints look let's read number 11. the old testament saints ascended up with his loud voice when he screamed and gave up the ghost because why the sacrifice the perpetuation of their sins that they had waited on believed that perfect lamb was coming they had offered the sacrifice what the natural lamb and when he died and yielded up the ghost he screamed with a loud voice and the old testament saints awoke so that was it what at his rapture so now let's go to number 12 because we know that when jesus died and resurrected he brought some of the saints with him there's not something we need to pick out why why he didn't why he didn't pick enoch and where's moses and where's elijah and he just says abraham isaac and different ones i'm just going to go what brother brown said some of the saints the bible says uh whoever they pick listen they ain't got nothing to do with me and you it's just the part of the plan of redemption though that we got to cover now look and now in this vision brother i'm talking about now the sixth dimension i believe i was caught up to that sixth dimension looking back down here and could see back see the sight isn't exactly with the eyes that's earthly but sight is a greater thing now what took brother branham across the curtain of time stick with me just a few minutes he was a man mortal he could see but when he was seeing something in another dimension that was a revelation that god only knew and you know what that if you'll think of this with me real quick that was the actual mind of god because he had already thought about it and had already seen it god god had already seen this and he already got it recorded listen if your life is recorded and you're going to have to give an account for your life at the end time and every person the same way that recorder's running all the time with everybody except the pride of jesus christ and we still have to give an account for certain things we'll cover that next wednesday night maybe some the bible says some man's sins go before some sins go after amen so i thank god we don't have to stand at the judgment bar the white throne judgment but we are going to be judged by the little things that we do that's why when you if you got something you better get it out man get it straightened with god get it straight with whoever you got to get it straight with and you know what it'll make you feel better it'll make you feel a lot better why because that load of sin is off of you and you don't have to worry about that knowing that it's gonna cause you know what it's gonna do it's gonna follow you some men's sins go before they follow you some come after all right and now in this vision i believe i was caught up in the sixth dimension looking back down here and could see back the side isn't exactly with the eyes that's earthly but sight is a greater thing than the sight that they have there their contact is far beyond any contact that our natural senses with contact now let me talk to you just a minute real quick look at me that thing doesn't change from what's in you now to when it's going across current time think about that the site that they have there their contact is far beyond any content that our natural senses would contact does everybody understand what i'm saying whatever they had inside of them the new birth they had inside of them didn't diminish when it went across the curtain of time so who's diminishing it go look in your mirror you're diminishing that is already inside of you trying to develop into that stature of a perfect man jesus what did jesus tell us he said i do nothing except the father shows me first why because the father was inside of him well now wait a minute now brother wait you that's just you can't have it heirs and join heirs whatever he gets we get we need to do whatever the father he said i only please young you know listen we're human beings but that's what i've said my whole theme is is let that thing out that's inside of you because that's what that's what brother branham saw in that other dimension was what this shell was gone this interpretation that we have this carnal mind was gone and they took exactly what was here listen what took them into that dimension what they had in this dimension that's what took them into that dimension was what they already had they didn't develop something once they got there but once they got there though their carnal mind was gone their their their limited sight was gone and they was able to tell brother branham if you'll read in one of them brother branham that 90 year old woman tells brother branham what he's got to do now reid if you read one of the accounts brother brown hugs the late the sister and and she steps over and talks to another sister he said and said oh i said we're glad he's here and then he said well where's jesus he said a little bit higher he said that woman turns and says you are a leader on earth said jesus will come and get finds you judge you by what you preached and said we'll all be under that and we'll come back to earth she was telling him because what her sight had been done away with as far as earthly sight and she had a heavenly sight now what's our problem our problem is is we've lost our connection with that site over there i thought we're supposed to if we don't have it over here how are they going to come this way how are they going to ever get here unless we let what we already got inside of us let it out let it change your body let it first change your thoughts change your body and then they'll want to come here because remember think about this you standing today with the new birth with the baptism of the holy ghost you're that close to the perfection that he's talking about they're already gone they got to come back here and get their body you're still in yours you have a chance that god can change you while you're alive if you want to be one of those alive and remain some of you are already dead well asleep sorry one day some of y'all gonna wake up and we're gonna be gone it ain't gonna be god's fault listen i don't care i don't care how much you who you are when people sleep through a sermon it don't make you feel good it'll make you feel good it's like you're not doing anything they ain't nothing there to contact it works other places so but it always happens it's the new guy you don't know what he's going to say so you still wait to listen see what you can trap him in where was i all right so we know we know and everybody know we pretty much have been told since we were coming to message how brother brian went across the curtain of time and he talked to all these young people instead of me reading it all i want to read you these few things right here and then we'll close because brother branham talks about agape love now they don't have this because i had to pull it up later i'm something's going on with my zip drive it's not putting all my quotes in here bob something's boo devil some of my quotes well all of my quotes on perfect love didn't make it so i'm going to read these quotes for you real quick because what did the angel tell brother branham he said whatever is here is perfect love this is all perfect love whatever you love and all those that loved you now remember and see people quote that and they go well i love the prophet so i'm going to be there because he said the angel said and i'm over here in the sixth dimension now whatever you love and whoever loved you and whoever you love comes remember his dog's there his horse was there and his chair was there i don't see how a cherokee loved but but it was a desire brother branham they repossessed his chair there's a repossessed chair in the sixth dimension you laugh if you want to but you know i saw so much god thought of the prophet he gave him everything he needed but you're over here in this dimension and the angel says everything you love and everyone that loved you now we got people that that have died believing that if they just love the prophet that they're gonna make it we heard it with our own mouth did we not well he said everybody love now look there's a difference because remember there's four different kinds of love that's what we're gonna talk about just for a minute we'll talk already wednesday night there's four different kinds of love there's what agape love or agapo got it and i'll place them right here real quick there's philio love there's lust and then there's filth everybody got that now how many loves is in that dimension sixth dimension one so they were standing in that dimension of perfect love where the angel says all that love you and all that you love will be there the problem is is these people in this dimension have still got feel your love and feelio love is for your wife or for and you go down lower to your kids and then go down to you you know you can hug your mom and not say hug his wife but still feel your love so there's a lot of thing goes over there then you're going down to lust but now look once you get over there all them other loves go away so the only thing i can tell you today is if you don't have agape love which is the baptism of the holy ghost the new birth in your soul you're not going there you can love the prophet with filial love all you want to you can love jesus christ with filial love all you want to in this dimension it will not take you to that dimension because agape love has got to come from that dimension into your soul by the new birth listen to this adoption 1960. we're still an adoption series here thus saith the lord it'll take perfect love to put you in that place for all that there is that for that's all there was there no matter how many how much religious denominations how many good deeds you do or whatever you've done that won't count nothing on that day it'll take perfect love so whatever you do you lay aside everything else until just as filled with the love of god till you can love those who hate you klamath falls 1960 from this time forward brother brown said just remember i'll say this with the faith that i have in that vision whatever it was i'll speak in the name of the lord except you have that perfect love you'll never be there watch this because nothing could ever be there without it listen to this we'll close right here musicians get ready to come your spirit would be out of place there your spirit would be out of place there it couldn't come there'd be no way for it to come now he ain't talking about emotion he ain't talking about filial love he's not talking about he's talking about what except you have the baptism of the holy ghost unless you have the new birth your spirit your normal spirit can't go there he'd be out of place it's more place in the fifth dimension because that's your old self without being born again amen listen to this last one musicians get ready to come the bible says in first john 4 18 says there is no fear and love but perfect love casteth out fear do you think any of those people were fear they weren't they were not fearful of anything in that sixth dimension because perfect love cast out fear now the problem is is we go from that down to filial love where we fear that people don't like us we fear that don't people don't love us we fear all these different things because look for fear has torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love i believe god sent the prophet across the curtain of time to do away with that fear of dying and not knowing where you're going you're going to soul sleep are you going to just be hanging in thin air you're going to be over here no you're going to be in perfect love glory and not that i love the prophet on this side that going to get you nowhere i thought it was the love of god is what puts you there now listen you can't love god with perfect love hearing not go there but you can love anybody you want to love the highest level you want to in the on this side and you miss going over there amen so don't tell me don't put that up well i just love that prophet i love to hear him speak i love that's okay but is it perfect love or is it filial love is it just a good feeling or is it something that you've took that's different than what it used to be that perfect love that cast out fear one more before we close musicians come on the prophet of god tells us that i heard a voice that spoke to me in that room that said this is what you preached was the holy ghost this is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it i am more determined than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to enter there there is no jealousy there's no tiredness there's no death sickness couldn't never in there mortality could never make you old they could not cry it was just one joy oh my precious brother they took me up to a great big place we'll read the rest of it wednesday we'll continue right there on perfect love perfect love oh i love to come to church see that word love has been used so bad let's stand our feet that that's been used so um loosely i guess by the world until oh i loved the hunt i loved the fish i loved this i loved that what love you talking about if you got four different kinds of love a lot of that's lust you lust after it you don't love it love is the love of god or the love you have for your family that you'd like brother brown said he said look he said here's the difference in agape love and feel your love he said filio love he said if a man put his arms around your wife he said you'd shoot him and kill him that's a direct quote he said you'd shoot him and kill him he said but if you got agape love he said you'll put your arms around him and pray for him he said agape love versus filial love filio love he said it'll make you shoot somebody for jealousy being jealous because that goes with jealousy and love down here but there's no jealousy over there but the agape love the love of god would have you pray for that man could you do that could you do that can you do that oh we love i i love bella she's a sweet girl and she's never done anything wrong to me and i'm saying i've never done anything wrong to her but boy if she got mad at me and do i still love her you better with the love of god you're supposed to love your enemy more than you do your brother that's why that brotherly kindness is way up there brother john right next to the capstone which is perfect love right up there close cause brother kindness and we'll read it wednesday night brother brown said that perfect love makes you love even your enemies people that you know hate you but see that's brotherly kind see that's not that's not the love down here that you get the holy ghost you get the holy ghost here then you've got your attitudes you gotta add that to your faith i add that to your virtue i had that i mean add to your faith virtue and all those tempers patience godliness and brotherly kindness perfect love that's the only thing that'll go there nothing else he said nothing he said your spirit in other words will not feel at home now i want to ask you a question and then we'll sing a song now if you have the baptism of the holy ghost today in your soul does it feel at home is this if you feel at home here in this then you don't have the right spirit because this is not our home brother branham wanted to stay over there more than he wanted to come back here and he knew he had a job to do but he said do i have to go back to that he was looking at his whole 50-something-year-old body he said do i have to go back to that angel said yep you're not done yet you need to go back and thank god he did because then the seal is open shortly after that we we know that now we're able to go take the change of the body that they're sure they're locked into that dimension we're locked into this dimension but by the baptism of the holy ghost we're actually in that dimension we're in another dimension you're by when you get a revelation it's not from this dimension it's from another dimension it comes from god it's not it's eternal have you ever got a real good revelation and forgot it i hadn't not a real good one i've had some thoughts in my mind right right we've had some thoughts in our mind and they kind of went away but if you ever get a true revelation i mean if somebody can talk you out of there being honored being a trinity if they can talk you out of what he what he preached wednesday night about no eternal hell if somebody can talk you say and you say well i believe maybe now there is a ethanol no come on you ain't got what you say you got amen you didn't get a real revelation because real revelation it actually is a part of what you are amen oh you might get a good thought that's human that's that's filio but agape love brings something to you that no man on this earth can ever bring to you no woman can ever bring it to you only god himself can bring that to you but we'll talk about that a little bit wednesday night but that sixth dimension that's perfect love amen but now remember one more time what's there what was in that old woman was the same thing within that old woman here before she died what's our problem let's sing a song what's our problem it's already there brother john it's already inside of us we're not going to gain anything you will find he's not too busy to hear your hearts cry reach out and touch listen if you need something today do what the song says and touch the lord reach out [Music] he will move [Music] you need something from job everything do it again to get through the crowd at all [Music] one more time [Applause] [Music] is hear your heart [Music] [Applause] [Music] i can think about that woman that's sitting there in that

effort you need a job go look for a job don't go sitting on your couch and think god's gonna knock on your door and bring in jobs or change the warehouse to closer to your house amen god knows what

and you turn around and say the same identical thing to that person that's not weird that's just even in filial love you enter into a place to where you and your husband why because you've lived with each other you've shared experiences you've shared you've shared children you've shared all the natural things and you enter into a place well now listen folks if you got the baptism of the holy ghost if you got the new birth he's your husband and you're his bride there shouldn't be a separation there i thought if we had the mind of christ paul said the mind of christ will tell us exactly what christ is saying hey man think about that yes sir please is is times and then he'll change his heart [Music] we ask these things in the name of jesus christ as we go and we're going to see some kind

tomorrow's monday that's the devil's day let's take that away from him and let it be a good day it'll be a good day for all of us you know we got um we got time on our hands and we got brother ray laying in the hospital and that's just when we dismiss let's just pray a prayer for him there's no distance between here and athens georgia for god brother ray's been a he's been an integral part of this congregation for a long time 25 years i think he said so it would be hoovless to just not worry about leaving right now if you got something better to do you walk out the door now but we're going to pray for brother ray and we're going to pray earnest prayer just like he's sitting right here in front of us and just like he's your natural brother because he's your spiritual brother which makes him more than your natural brother amen because a natural brother we we've got a brother laying there that that's a spiritual brother that's been with us for a while and kathy we need to pray for her too um even if she does have to make decisions um thank the lord that mary the red cross is flying her over here for free so i don't know when she's going to get here but but we pray that even though brother ray they raised god can raise him right up out of the bed he still needs to see his family he still needs to know that they're right there with him amen but he needs to know that the spiritual family we can't go dad tried to go yesterday and they turned him away with all this junk going on at the hospitals you can't get in but we know somebody can amen remember brother branham one time he couldn't go in i said you can't go in you can't go in you know what he's done remember he found a nurse and they put him on like he was an intern they put he's a way you can get in maybe not now as much as not yet now as much as then they got cameras and everything but back then brother brown was going to pray for that person he didn't care what so they loaded him up made him look like a nurse and put him in the he went in the hospital and prayed for that lady so we're going to pray now for brother ray and then we'll be dismissed and go with god we love you with love with lord we'll see you on wednesday night and we'll hear a good report for brother a amen let's power heads the heavenly father lord we know if time continues on that we'll stand here and pray for many people that are getting older in body and the devil's trying their best to get rid of all of us but lord the weakness of the body as we get older we know that's just time and we know that we're caught in this until lord you return and take us home but father you never told us that your our faith should diminish you never told us that you would leave us or forsake us you said no i will not you should i'll be right there with you even until the end and father i pray that you'd be with brother ray right now lord that lord not somehow we know that you're an on-time god we know how you work that you according to the prayers of the saints lord you said for us to pray fervently so lord we're praying fervently that our brother will raise up for your honor and glory and that we'll see him back again lord we know that there was time back when the prophet was here that you sent us a prophet that could see visions and and tell people things and and lord he he would bring the comp build the confidence of the people or father you have not diminished from that amen lord that gift is now in the whole bride of jesus christ that we can lord claim already the healing of our brethren by the stripes of jesus christ at calvary lord you took all everything we were thinking the other day you took every disease that's ever been named and you took it to your bosom at calvary and you died and said it's finished but lord we have to believe that it's already done even the prophet said if you came back lord in a suit of clothes and stood in this pulpit could do no more than what you've already done at calvary for our brethren lord i pray that you would be with him now be with sister kathy give her comfort lord we want to see him again we pray the family will be together lord and get together and we know there's a few of the family members lord that don't know you lord francis and the different ones lord we pray for them father that this will bring them that they'll shake them lord out of that demon that's been holding on to him for years lord out in the world that you'll break that thing loose lord and that lord for your honor and glory that they will be united as a family in in natural and also a family and spiritual father lord we pray that anyone here lord has any affliction or any need lord that you would administer to them right now we need you more than anything we don't need a shot or a physician or a good hospital we know that that's there for from we know we use them but we need you because you're the one that has destroyed all that you've destroyed the works of the devil we just got to believe that that when you died at calvary you even went down to hell and took the keys he doesn't even have keys to his own house he can't put us in or take us out lord we go in willingly father i pray that we willingly today will even as we go home that we'll continually remember our brethren and his name will come up lord many many times if you have to wake us up at night lord i pray wake us up so that we'll call his name and pray for our little brother lord many prayers are going around the world for him also lord as several have called from around the country lord asking about our brother ray he's known for a lot of people he's he lord i believe he's been a servant of yours for a long time and i pray now that that will go to him lord and that it'll heal him for your honor and glory let the doctors do what they can do give them wisdom to do what they can do but father they can't heal they can only do the things they know to do but you're the healer and we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ that you would strengthen that whole family give them strength for the little journey that they're going through lord and any of us the brother kali and all the different ones that's been through certain journeys there we pray lord that it's a journey that when we come out on the other side we say thank you god thank you lord for thinking of me as a child being your child lord but lord i pray that from this day forward that we grow up that we're not being crying babies anymore lord that we will be adults that we'll be able to know the mind of god when it comes to us lord we know that you've given us lord the new birth you've given us lord the baptism of the holy ghost now i pray lord as i've said before that we let that thing out and let it live let it do what it was accomplished what it was set here to do to accomplish a change of a body lord though we get older though many things happen as in abraham lord he got 99 years old and then finally lord i believe he looked up one day and said i can't do it anymore so lord as we look up to you today we can't do it anymore we can't try to figure this thing out we're just going to believe lord that you'll do what you said in your word that you'll heal our brethren that you'll heal each one of us lord give us all a rejuvenation of the baptism of the holy ghost give us a refilling father so that it'll clean out some of the flues that we have stopped up to lord we pray that you'd be with each one lord take care of each one on the highways be with them in their jobs the different things that they do in life lord we pray that it'll be done for your honor and glory in jesus name we ask these things amen you're dismissed god bless you
