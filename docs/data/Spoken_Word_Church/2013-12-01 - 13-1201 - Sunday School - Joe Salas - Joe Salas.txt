========================================

good morning brother altered and brother of Bob I think he's pretty mobile so you know what happens when nobody's here y'all stuck with me you get stuck with us do it you get stuck with us of my Bible is to Exodus 11 it will start at 12 through 13. 11 chapter 11. and 13. yeah verse 12 and 13. oh sorry this time that you guys all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and Beast and against all the gods of Egypt and I will execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for token upon the houses where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you in the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smike the land of Egypt uh brother Brian preacher I messaged the token I picked up this book and I couldn't put it until I finished the whole thing it's got a lot of good stuff on it so you want to read something and do that so what what what whatever token coconut blood shall be to you a token he said now first first one is a token Israel word is commonly used among we English people speaking peoples especially here in America at token is really the dictionaries that are token is a sign of a fair price paid see that they're fair or price and required pride has been paid been paid he said like a fair in a railroad or a fair on a bus line you go in and purchase your fair and then they give you a token and that token cannot be spent for nothing else but to the real world line and it is a token to the real world company that you have paid repair and it's a token and you can't spend it for nothing else it doesn't work on any other line it just works on that line only and it is a token said that now down here they were speaking of where we're starting and it was sent to Israel the blood of the Lamb is a token for you Israel's Lamb slain with Jehovah's requirement it must be the blood God had made a token and give it to Israel and no other tokens will work see it cannot be recognized he said to to the world's a bunch of foolishness but to God is the only way the only thing that God that he requires a token it must be there and you cannot have the token until the fair is paid then you're a possessor of the token which gives you the privilege of a free pass he said I'll see the blood and I'll pass over you what a Time that what a privilege to know that you packed within you the past when I see the blood I'll pass over you it's the only thing that he recognizes is nothing else that can take this place no substitute no denomination no nothing else it takes that that's God's that alone will I see said no matter how Roger there was how good they was and how much education they had and how they dressed the token was the only thing when I see the token I pass over you the blood was a token that their requirement a Jehovah had been have been made was a token that it had been done the blood stood for the token but God was a token see the light when God called the Lord he told him I have surely seen the Affliction on my people which are in Egypt and I have heard their pride by reason other test message and I am I am grammar when Moses said it pharah asked me what is his name say that I am that I am they said come not to deliver them and I'm sending them when God calls you we have to go just like us over here you know when it's my turn to do this Sunday school class I have to say brother Ryan doing that somebody else do it so we we have to go when God calls you so we can't put it on somebody else so Moses have to go away even though he didn't want to go you say I can't talk he's like me I can't help defend somebody else but yeah he had to go and I'm sending thee and I will be with thee this will be a token unto thee that I have sent thee they said go tell pharaoh that I said the god of the Hebrews let my people go if he won't let them go throw your stick down and it will become a serpent so what did Moses do he threw his serpent down where the Pharisee you come up here with sticks that you know make snakes out of sticks you know is that all you got he said if you won't believe the first time then do this other sign I'm not going to go through all that but what do you do uh you turn the water the blood the frogs the lies the Flies the old Egypt cattle die boil upon man and be strain hail Locust Darkness for three days but fair will still not let them go okay let's go to just 11. okay we're in 11. let in one to ten I wasn't gonna read the whole thing but uh actually brother Ram said he he liked for everybody to read the whole choker 12 11 and 12 the whole thing you know the 12 is a long chapter so let's read the whole thing on 11. okay and the Lord said unto Moses yet will I bring one more plague upon pharaoh and upon Egypt afterwards he will let you go ahead but he shall let you go he should surely trust you our hands all together he said speak now in the ears are that people don't let every man borrow of his neighbor and every woman of her neighbor Jews of silver and jewels of gold and the lord gave that people favorite inside of Egypt moreover the man Moses was very brave in the land of Egypt and the side of Pharaoh's servants and then the side of the people and Moses said God said the Lord about midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt and only first born in the land of Egypt shall die from the first born Affair that sitted upon his throne even unto the firstborn of the main servants there is behind the mill and all the firstborn of the Beast and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt such as there was none like a nor shall be like it anymore fight against any other children in Israel shall not a dog move his tongue against man or beast that you may know how that the Lord will put a difference a difference between the Egyptians and Israel between the Believers and unbelievers I'm putting that in sorry and always thy servants shall come down unto me and bow down themselves unto me saying get the UT and all the people that follow thee and after that I will go uh and he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger and the Lord said unto Moses Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you then my wonders may be multiplying in the land of Egypt and more Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before pharaoh and the Lord hardened pharaohs or so that he will not let the children of Israel go let's go to 12 1 to 11. thank you and the Lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron the land of Egypt saying this man shall be unto you the beginning of the month and it shall be the first month of the year to you speaking until the congregation of Israel saying in the 10th day of this month they shall take to them every man of land according to the to the house of their fathers and land for a house and if the household will be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to the eating shall make your count for the land your lamb shall be without blemished and mail the first year you shall take it out from the Sheep or from The Ghost and you shall keep it until the 14th day of the same month and then the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill the idiot in the evening time the message be in the evening time and they shall take other blood and striking their two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses where they shall eat it and as I eat the Flesh in that night close to the fire and on 11 bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it and you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remain of it until the morning you shall burn it with fire whatever we do with a break from the community you cannot keep it and thou shall eat it with your loincer your shoes on your feet and you step in your hand and you shall eat it in the haste it is the lowest to Passover total 21-24 as well as well 20 1 to 24. like I said brother Ryan I wanted you to read the whole thing but it's a long chapter in chapter 12 it was a long chapter so that's your uh that's your homework and Moses called for all the Elders of Israel I said unto them draw on and take your lamb according to your families and kill the Passover and you shall take a lunch at hyssop and hit brother and said it's just that we so where they grow up there they're easy to find so that's what they use and you shall take a bunch of hits up and dip it in the blood that is in the Goosebumps and two cycles with their blood that is in the basement and none and you shall go out at the door his house until the morning uh you think Pharaoh would put that blood on it so Castle pallets or whatever he had I don't think so they let for the Lord would pass through this to Smite the Egyptians and when he see the blood upon the little and on the two side post the Lord would pass over the door and I will not suffer the Destroyer to come unto you your house is to Smite you and you shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy Sons forever how long do we have to keep the communion I mean some people take it every month some people they it depends but we have to keep that ordinance and we shall come to pass when you you come to the land which is the Lord will give you a poem because he had prama that you shall keep the service our promised land that was a promised land for them as a promise not to us amen let's go to uh 12 uh let's let's do 29 maybe till 32. and it came to pass that at midnight the Lord's small Smite all the first one in Atlanta from the first one of prayer that stated on his throne until the first morning they kept it that was in the dungeon and all the firstborn of the cattle and Pharaoh rose up in the night and he and all his servants and all the Egyptians there was a great cry in Egypt but there was not a house where there was not one day and he called for Moses and Aaron by night and said rise up and get you for from among my people both you and the children of Israel and go serve the Lord as ye have said also take your thoughts and your hers that you have said and be gone check this out and bless me also was a pharaoh at that and unbelievable he just that I think for the Brisco says uh you know when you're a Christian the people in the world may know where the goods are they kind of asked you to pray for them so I think that's the Pharaoh did I don't think he was a Believer I don't know you know but that's funny he said and and bless me also foreign and now this was the perfect lamb Christ was and then through that shed of his this land that natural land in Egypt that blood was applied and when it was it stood for a token then what would the blood of lamb stand for for today for see the token that we were that we're dead to ourselves and identify we are sacrificed see then the lamb and the blood and the person becomes identified together the sacrifice and the believer you see you identified in your life by your sacrifice it makes you what you are and the blood was a token or identification the blood identified that the worshiper has slain the lamb and accepted the land and apply the token to themselves that he was not ashamed he didn't care who stole it he wanted everybody to see it and it was placed in such a position that everybody passing by could see that token he said uh many people want to be Christians they like to do it and secretly so nobody would know that they were Christian or their associates they run around with some of them but now I want to be a Christian but I don't want so and so to know about us see we're not you see that it's not Christianity Christianity has just displayed a spoken publicly in public life at the office or on the street when travel is around and hanging in church everywhere else the blood is a token and a total must be applied and see it's not even the Covenant is not in effect by the way was talking about it when he goes to a Walmart that receives someone on the floor they picks it up so you know people can see that you're different than they are you know yeah may the Lord have mercy on my dad when he used to drive around we used to drive around and uh he'd be drinking a beer and he opened the window and throw it out the window and one of the people that drink post throw half a can out full you know and we were sitting in the back we didn't want to we didn't want to drink the beer we don't taste the beer but we did because he just flew him in the back where we were so that's not applying to token I'm not talking bad about my dad but I'm saying the difference you know see the land was killed in the evening time after being kept up for 14 days and then the land was killed and the blood was applied in the healing time you get it the token never come into existence until the evening time and this is the evening time of the age that we live in this is the evening time for the church this is the evening time for me it's the evening time of my message I'm dying I'm going I'm going I'm moving out in the evening time of the Gospel we come through justification so forth but this is the time that the token has to be applied he said I told you last Sunday I had something I wanted to talk to you about this is it the time that when you just can't play with it it's got to be done if it's ever going to be done it's got to be done now but because we can see that the Wrath is about to ready to pass through the land and everything from under that token will perish the blood has identified you said for the animal life could not come back upon the human being when I'm I was reading a message too where president said you know you have a Chinese uh black people or whatever they can give you a transfusion but if you get any blood from an animal it can kill you so if that blood from the animal and the human doesn't mix yeah when the Bible said the light went out in his core of course because it was a unit and when the blood of blood was gone from it to life being different from the blood now the blood is the chemistry of the life but the life is something different from the blood but the life is in the blood and an animal of life could not come back upon the worshiper when he shed his the blood of the Lamb he had to apply to chemistry because that the life was gone and could not come back he said because it cannot come back up on a human being because the animal life doesn't have a soul animal does not know that he is naked he also talks about Cain and Abel he said that uh Abel knew that it wasn't the peaches or apples or you know it was the blood yeah he doesn't realize that sin he knows none so therefore it's a living be but not a living Soul therefore the animal could not come back upon a human life because it didn't have a soul in that life now there is a lot of blood and life and soul and life that soul is the nature of their life therefore there are no certain nature it was an animal therefore their blood stood for token that their life had been given he said by this glorious place under this Covenant there is a difference between the blood and the life the token for the believer today is the Holy Ghost not a not a blood or chemistry but it's the holy spirit of God that is that token that God god require the church today God must see this token he must say it in every one of us they said the animal alive could not return back therefore God had to be placed on the door upon the lentil and upon the post of the door that every passerby the whole public the Republic everybody coming by the house knew that there was a sign on the door a blood their life had died at that door that's the way it has to be with every believer today filled with the Holy Ghost a token that the shed Blood by the lamb that the light was in the lamb has returned back and it's publicly sealed in there that everybody passing by talked talking to you has an associate with you seeing that the bird has been applied in a token of the life was in that blood is upon you you are safe from the Wrath let alone not membership no sir an animal life could not come back upon the believer because it was an animal it only spoke of a conscious showing that they would come at perfect sacrifice now how could there be a more perfect sacrific fight than God himself becoming the atonement himself when God was made first in his own creative blood that the only way that a life of God could ever come back because all of us were born by sex and therefore the life as in areas of the world and that life will not stand it's the thing that's already judged and condemned you can't patch it up there's no way to patch it there is no way to smooth it out there's no way to make it better it's got to die that's the only requirement it is it's got to die and the substitute of life of Jesus Christ has to come into you which is the Holy Ghost God's spoken that you have accepted the blood of his son Jesus Christ and blood identify identify the believer because their life had gone on could not come back so he had to have a chemistry he had to have like a king the blood of Cameron said it showed that the life went promised now the very Spirit itself is a token the Holy Spirit itself is a token not the blood the blood will shed a Calvary but it's true but the blood as far as it went went back into the elements which come from the food that he lived on but you see inside that blood cell was a life that started the blood cell to move it it was the chemistry had no life in itself and therefore it could not move but when the life come into the chemistry of the blood it formed the cell it form its own cell then cell after cell then became a man and that man was God Emmanuel and flesh but when their life we turned back the chemistry it went to it but the token is a holy ghost upon the church that they see Christ they said Israel was commanded to stay under their blood until March the Lord Has Come don't go out from under when Once under that token they were still in here and there don't leave they stay right there until it midnight stroke and then Trump is blown and when Trump is blue they all ramps horns began to blow each one marches out with his provision going to the promised land so does the man or woman who is filled with the Holy Ghost he sealed away and has secured from all harm and danger his whole life displays what he is wherever he walks whatever business he does whoever he talks with when he comes in contact with women when he comes in with contact with social when he comes in with contact with everything that that token is laying there amen when it comes to death I'll fear no evil whether I with me that token laser when it comes to Restoration you'll be there or God will raise him up at the last day Jesus said when I see that blood the token I'll pass over you remember that total was not displayed even the Covenant was not a mall that's right the Covenant was in all there was no it wasn't in effect the Covenant wasn't unless the token was there said there might be many Jews Jews say come here I ain't got no blood on my door but I want to show you something I'm a circumcised you I'm a circumcised I don't mean that his fingers said when I see the blood I'll pass over you I'm Jews could say I believe Jehovah you listen to the message of the hour he did certainly they had a lot of messages but this was the message of the ioc I believe the message they are yeah their blood was applied in the evening time I'll pass over it's got requirement of the hour the evening time message is they apply the token right that's our massive healing time just like the circumcise of the Jews he say I'm a Jew why do I have to go out there and act like that other bunch of fanatics sorry Moses stand up up and down the street saying that an evening message is here it shall come to pass at the end of that 14 days You Shall Gather the congregation together and kill the lamb the whole congregation the Israel shall kill it put their hands up on it the identify themselves and their blood shall be struck Upon Us post and upon the little of the door and when I see the battle pass over you for as a token that you accepted the the lamb that I have provided for you the blood was a token now that spirit is a token you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost not many days hands and when the blood will share the duck almost Stand Down on the day of Pentecost like the rushing Mighty Wind any questions any comments I had a question why 14 days why did he keep Landing for 14 years maybe we can answer it okay we're fortunate if I know that's verse 6 of chapter 12. you know looking for the blemishes that might be on the lamp yeah they were they were they were I mean I remember the reason for the 14 days but I know that they did look at and investigate and make sure it was it was without a blemish yeah they kept it for a testing right yeah no I think it had effect in Christ too yeah yeah I was in Christ they look at like uh the time before the sacrifice they did look look at real selfies the priests had to do that amount of time there's a tons of stuff here so we're just going to cut it off and because I think I think I still have to do it one more time so unless Ryan thank you yeah
