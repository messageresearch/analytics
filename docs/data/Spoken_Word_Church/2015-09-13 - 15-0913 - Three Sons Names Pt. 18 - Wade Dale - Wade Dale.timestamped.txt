[0:00] you're Rebecca no that's fine Bob's not
[0:03] here to Bob not getting straight all
[0:10] right here we go now all right hey look
[0:16] a loop Merkel Lucas is becoming 30 years
[0:21] old everyone a real well thank you
[0:24] because that's all you in the Boogaloo
[0:28] the Bible says Jesus becoming 30 goes to
[0:31] the river and his baptized now he did
[0:33] not need to receive the Holy Ghost he
[0:36] was born the son of man God in human
[0:39] flesh we know that night so so he look
[0:41] what did he receive he received an
[0:43] anointing for his ministry right now
[0:47] there's a lot of confusion with that but
[0:50] see that's another subject that we've
[0:51] already covered but most of us has been
[0:53] here long enough to know that Jesus was
[0:55] born he Manuel God entered in that baby
[1:00] when he was born amen the fullness of
[1:05] the Godhead bodily laying in a cradle
[1:08] hey but then brother man will say will
[1:12] you become the fullness of the Godhead a
[1:13] river Jordan no he manifested it he
[1:16] started brother Brown said it was his
[1:18] coronation day now okay if if day was a
[1:22] king and I was born a baby what am I out
[1:28] of there Prince heir to the throne right
[1:32] don't give me the car keys to the
[1:34] kingdom yet but when I come to my 30 age
[1:38] of 30 years over 29 and a half becoming
[1:40] 30 teen daddy begins to train me all
[1:46] right he begins to train me so when
[1:48] Jesus went to the River Jordan he
[1:49] received an anointing the pre strength
[1:52] to preach three and a half years that
[1:55] all of Christendom is based on that
[1:57] three and half years all of Christian
[2:00] anybody except for the you know look is
[2:04] low and all that stuff okay they know
[2:07] Jesus was
[2:08] anybody judeo-christian people believe
[2:11] that Jesus come and preach three and a
[2:14] half years and that is the basic of all
[2:16] Christianity that he was born that he
[2:20] preached the gospel and he died
[2:22] resurrected assembly can come back on
[2:24] the definite color pretty much everybody
[2:27] believed that now there's different
[2:28] forms of that but that is the form that
[2:31] he took to hide himself from some and
[2:36] reveal himself to us so on a day of
[2:39] river jordan brother brampton called it
[2:41] his coronation day what happens if God
[2:44] comes out and says hey this is my son in
[2:47] whom I'm pleased to dwell now you can
[2:48] say here you him here because you just
[2:50] start in this ministry just beginning
[2:51] okay because the vital said even Jesus
[2:54] grew in grace and knowledge and be made
[2:59] perfect because a bunch of pictures to
[3:01] go being made purview solenoid yeah he
[3:03] was born perfect but this he was still
[3:05] man you still in right being made
[3:11] perfect flesh the flesh because what
[3:15] happened was is he still was tempted in
[3:17] all these things and and all of his he
[3:22] must have somewhere in there had a will
[3:24] he said not my will but thy will right
[3:27] they said not my will but thy will be
[3:29] done right so somewhere in there he had
[3:32] to bring all that other suggestion but
[3:34] when Jesus was on our River Jordan the
[3:37] Holy Ghost ascended down like a dove Jon
[3:40] stead and the dub remain then that was
[3:44] the Ministry of Jesus Christ what God in
[3:47] human flesh preaching the gospel to what
[3:51] the children of the kingdom he goes he
[3:53] does Matthew 13 he goes and starts with
[3:55] what we store the seed whose ass or not
[3:58] a man where was the seed in him where's
[4:03] the seed in the mouth I mean when you a
[4:05] male to female gets together word see
[4:06] seeds in the mail alright so what he
[4:10] done he sowed the seed of eternal life
[4:11] that start the green
[4:13] years of preaching no one was perfect
[4:16] and he does preach Daniel 70 week i'll
[4:21] show it to you he'll tell you how the
[4:25] Madison second temple of God he'll show
[4:28] you all the all the things when this one
[4:30] comes and that welcomes he's pointing
[4:32] right straight to after we get out of
[4:34] here remember Matthew 24 is the seal
[4:36] then he begins to talk about what the
[4:39] olive tree who's that in Israel so dad
[4:43] because you know why she won't know that
[4:46] he told Daniel what's right if we
[4:50] believe God is one the Christ that was
[4:54] in Daniel in the Old Testament told
[4:57] Daniel was right and it couldn't be no
[5:00] different than when Jesus stepped on
[5:01] earth speaking back he had to fulfil all
[5:05] the scriptures all right that's where we
[5:08] get kind of confused and we say well
[5:09] maybe that no Christ old Daniel what to
[5:13] say and write then when Christ came on
[5:15] earth he could sell different so now if
[5:17] we believe the three and a half year
[5:18] Ministry of William Brown the ending of
[5:21] his message the dependable was the
[5:26] message of the Son of Man could it be
[5:28] imperfect sure he say 509 five thousand
[5:33] you know what I believe God then control
[5:37] all that just to throw people off just
[5:42] to throw people off that's all it does
[5:44] and you know what he he told us he said
[5:49] thank you Father he even thank God for
[5:52] confusing the wise and prudent and
[5:55] revealed an underpaid such as will learn
[5:57] so i said saying you know one devil he
[5:58] said while i was to talking you saying
[6:01] yesterday today whatever whatever he
[6:05] said back then is going on now or it's
[6:07] not the Eternal Word of God so if it's
[6:09] any different so then now let's go one
[6:12] more step if brother round come and
[6:14] preaches anything different than what
[6:17] jesus freak he's a false prophet
[6:21] hey man he said what about the white
[6:24] horse rider listen there was a mighty
[6:30] Conqueror there was a white horse road
[6:32] in that first Earth days he told us that
[6:34] what he was but there is a false white
[6:37] horse rider in opposition who goes first
[6:42] the devil or God God goes first he had
[6:46] white righteous church he was the mighty
[6:48] Conqueror but there was a revelation hid
[6:51] under that than when the seals open he
[6:54] showed that day that the revelation 6
[6:58] white horse rider was antic rough yet
[7:04] Hannah the Bible's ribs absolutely
[7:11] I mean how much did you read it before
[7:14] you came even even i'm going to say
[7:16] receiving you burn not just in the
[7:18] message but when you receiving ueber
[7:19] things open up you've it that you had
[7:22] sent down a read and read and read and
[7:25] read and read and read and then you're
[7:28] ready one day I'd go who put that in
[7:31] there who put that in my because you
[7:35] could plainly see what was going on
[7:37] right okay that's what that's what the
[7:40] message come to do the message come to
[7:43] prepare us for a revelation then the
[7:48] message don't give you the revelation
[7:51] God gives you the revelation of what the
[7:53] message said remember in Revelation 10
[7:56] John topping the bride takes the book
[7:59] from the what the mighty angel not from
[8:01] brother branham are not from the seventh
[8:03] angel he goes and gets the book from the
[8:05] what from Christ alright so not doing
[8:09] the later brother Brian because in the
[8:10] days of the boys he's when it showed us
[8:12] remember he's the leds are right Rebecca
[8:18] and Isaac and Ellie's are three's a
[8:20] crowd but Healy's are on that camel walk
[8:25] he didn't just he told her every
[8:30] characteristic of Isaac told them i mean
[8:33] just so much as when Rebecca jumps off
[8:35] the camel she looks out a feeling
[8:37] there's probably 200 people in field
[8:39] working she goes they're here yeah
[8:42] Ellie's Arvind you know what eliazar
[8:44] that didn't go know when y'all get
[8:47] married would be in this room over here
[8:48] no you never hear he leaves our home all
[8:52] he took Rebecca to Isaac and then Isaac
[8:57] and Rebecca I got married you don't hear
[9:00] any more abilities our Ellie's or took
[9:02] us to Christ but what she got off that
[9:04] cam alone was what Ellie's right over a
[9:08] man and then what she got off and run
[9:12] for Isaac knowing who that was was what
[9:15] Kelly's are told her before she got to
[9:19] Christ our eyes
[9:21] so it's the message of the hour that's
[9:24] what brings us to Christ because brother
[9:27] Brown you know that I love the little
[9:29] picture in brother Claude study I
[9:32] brother Jesse did it years ago but
[9:34] remember when brother branham indicted
[9:35] this generation he's pointing like this
[9:37] and then what he had was in the split
[9:40] picture and he had brother around
[9:41] standing here pointing and then he had
[9:43] the cloud of the Christ of the Hoffman
[9:46] heavy Christ end in the cloud and said a
[9:49] true prophet points you to cry and I
[9:52] like that yeah he was taking off the
[9:56] same while because we would Rebecca with
[9:58] him what you know if Eleazar would
[10:00] stayed there now the easier would it
[10:02] become common to Rebecca but it wasn't
[10:08] let's just put it in 2015 terms it
[10:10] wasn't el es or show right it's the
[10:14] bride in the bridegroom whatever you do
[10:17] now in your life people influence your
[10:20] life but the day you come to your
[10:21] wedding there's only two people stand in
[10:23] the front that's the bride and the bride
[10:25] green that's all nobody else you've got
[10:27] all the other people that are attendance
[10:29] our help but they don't all getting the
[10:33] same car with you and they're not all
[10:34] stuffed in a motel room or wherever you
[10:36] go on your home them they're not stuffed
[10:37] in there with you well if you got to be
[10:41] if you gotta be well if you got 20 mins
[10:44] and attendance and all that stuff and
[10:46] people helping you what I'm saying is
[10:48] the support group is to get you ready to
[10:50] get everything through it take some of
[10:53] the pressure off you and it's your day
[10:55] it's your name and truly if you want to
[10:59] get technical with it it's not even the
[11:02] bridegroom's day the like i said before
[11:07] you walk out i walked out you know and
[11:11] everybody's what they're anticipating
[11:15] when that song starts they rise and they
[11:18] don't look at me they turn and look at
[11:21] who the bride they don't care whether
[11:24] you're there and I they'd never
[11:27] heard anybody say that sure was a
[11:29] beautiful bright green if they do this
[11:33] two different things going on there but
[11:36] they said oh what a beautiful dress that
[11:39] bridegroom gar what a beautiful outfit
[11:41] one dude will hair they never say a
[11:43] mother bird I mean to bribery okay but
[11:46] you know what though the bridegroom
[11:47] knows who he is that's my whole point
[11:50] the bridegroom knows who he is he knows
[11:53] he's the head of the house he knows he's
[11:54] the one that she's coming to and the one
[11:58] that he's going to get to take behind
[12:01] the curtain are behind the end of ten
[12:03] not all these other people so he's ok
[12:06] he's confidence one say about you talk
[12:08] about what are you are you belittling
[12:10] the Lord know the Lord's wanted a stack
[12:12] bride to marry he knows who he is she's
[12:17] laying here yeah she's not when she
[12:18] wants up an out she's not looking
[12:20] everybody he's looking to write him when
[12:23] she you know all of you they got mad
[12:25] what were you leave for shutting the
[12:26] door open when we leaving for well hey
[12:28] John Susie no you know what most of you
[12:32] don't know who was at your wedding there
[12:37] was two hundred people in my way and I
[12:39] can't tell you except for the attendants
[12:41] and the people with took pictures who
[12:43] was there I mean afterwards you go they
[12:46] were there oh yeah they were right there
[12:48] on the front row you know or they were
[12:50] right there I me I don't know so see
[12:53] what I'm talking about when we come and
[12:54] then when we come to this ministry of
[12:56] the Son of Man it's a perfect ministry
[12:59] it's taking us straight to Christ no no
[13:03] false doctrine can take that into a body
[13:08] chain so we got to get this Daniel 70
[13:10] weeks right just like the way the
[13:12] Prophet preach that he couldn't preach
[13:14] it no more than what the Bible says are
[13:17] no less you ever overseas
[13:20] I was thinking that has something to do
[13:27] with
[13:30] well see then you've got the other side
[13:33] watch this though you got the other side
[13:34] that says um is it over here I think but
[13:40] I know it's in foreign country so maybe
[13:42] mention it to me the other day that now
[13:44] they're saying it's all ensure all the
[13:46] attentions on the bride but like I said
[13:48] before the bridegroom's who wanted to
[13:50] ask the bridegroom is one us in buying
[13:53] the bride answer you can't do away with
[13:54] him but you know what I don't want
[13:58] people to notice me how old people to
[14:01] notice my bride because I know who I am
[14:03] right so God knows who he is just not
[14:07] belittling God because what they're
[14:08] saying on this side is that it saw the
[14:10] bride that Brides has been elevated
[14:12] above the head wrong you can't put that
[14:15] in the Bible you can't put that the
[14:17] prophets message Christ is the head
[14:19] always the man but now remember brother
[14:22] Graham says she is him well what he's
[14:25] saying is is she is him she's not
[14:28] exactly him she's different he's eternal
[14:32] God with an eternal body we're still
[14:36] down here is the bride trying to get
[14:39] perfected to take a body chain so no but
[14:43] she is now in characteristic we can't
[14:46] act any different than the head now
[14:49] they're okay when she is him it's not
[14:52] that she is him she's him made manifest
[14:56] in another part because remember truly
[15:00] Adam and Eve were one she was the same
[15:03] DNA she had the same body he did but she
[15:05] didn't have the same forward he did hey
[15:08] man she'd have same for him she had a
[15:11] character different than him because one
[15:13] brother Ram say he took the feminist
[15:15] part about putting need so Adam had two
[15:17] families part I mean Eve had finished
[15:19] part I don't hate the male part right so
[15:23] the true / one bone of their bone flesh
[15:25] the flesh but in characteristic look so
[15:30] we can never want to say that we can
[15:31] ever be putting ourselves in the place
[15:34] of the bridegroom ever cuz you know
[15:38] watch your
[15:39] you're superseding your head ship and as
[15:42] you and your wife follow God is how god
[15:45] it's like brother Brown said how you
[15:46] treat your wife South God creats you
[15:49] pretty much basically that's what it is
[15:51] okay so we're not getting anywhere today
[15:55] they just all right i mean we're trying
[15:57] to build something here because the Son
[15:59] of Man mastery is a perfect ministry it
[16:01] has no flaws come down brother branham
[16:05] was not based on a man he was a son of
[16:06] man but the son the son of man spoke so
[16:09] much through him till they thought he
[16:11] was God I grabbed her and think I was
[16:15] God to think I was the devil memory said
[16:17] that one time he said I'd rather think I
[16:19] was that close to be God them for
[16:21] somebody he said but I've been called an
[16:22] antichrist hood so you see with the same
[16:25] way with these doctrines of the bride
[16:28] groom being the most important and the
[16:33] bride groom I mean the bride being the
[16:35] most important let's bring them together
[16:37] let's bring them together input we know
[16:40] who he is he's the controller of
[16:42] everything supposed to be the controller
[16:44] of everything that we do but I'm glad
[16:48] brother Dale said what he did a couple
[16:49] of sundays ago because I've always want
[16:51] to say I'm ow scraping afraid you get
[16:53] mad all I can get lift people get mad at
[16:54] him I've always said that there's hears
[16:57] us down here here's what we supposed to
[17:03] be this is the perfect will of god this
[17:05] is the permissive will of God we live
[17:08] I'm talk about not right here most of
[17:10] the time we live on this side that gray
[17:13] area because i was telling who was that
[17:18] problem to yesterday don't I have
[17:22] something to yesterday everything for
[17:23] yesterday anyway we were talking about
[17:26] that o Shah umbrella markets the morning
[17:32] listen you sleep eight hours a day at
[17:36] least Im you sleep eight hours a day
[17:37] some longer some shorter that's an
[17:40] average of eight
[17:41] or today all right 20 hours a day you're
[17:43] sweet you only got 16 hours left right
[17:49] how much of it you you work eight hours
[17:53] then you got only it sorry you only got
[17:55] eight hours left right you got eight
[18:00] hours left because you're in work be
[18:03] honest you're not thinking about going
[18:04] all the time sometimes he may come down
[18:07] to bring something but I'm what I'm
[18:08] saying is what really i was talking
[18:09] about him is over here and the will of
[18:12] God was this person right here the Son
[18:16] of Man was in the will of God I do
[18:18] nothing except the father show me no
[18:19] we're not through that part yet hey man
[18:23] now no but we live in here and then God
[18:27] lets the slide over every once in a
[18:28] while a village prevalence and then we
[18:30] slide back over please get out of sleep
[18:32] you got eight hours of working right a
[18:36] 16-hour you only got eight hours left
[18:38] how long you have to pay your bills you
[18:41] go to walmart for an hour you pay your
[18:43] bills for an hour you drive somewhere to
[18:47] visit friends and family you calling
[18:49] your cell phone you look on facebook or
[18:51] any other thing i like them but you
[18:53] spend with your time focused on
[18:54] something so you really only got about
[18:56] an hour that you can really sit down i
[19:00] was telling mark i said i was praying
[19:02] hard the other night about something how
[19:05] about sleep run Millar woke up the next
[19:08] morning like I didn't finish how I am
[19:12] done I guess God was finished listening
[19:15] to me so here's late anyone hear me no
[19:18] more but there was something I was
[19:20] really praying it was Batman back soon I
[19:22] was praying to all of a sudden it was
[19:23] seven o'clock in the morning I thought
[19:25] well maybe my mind kept on going you
[19:29] know because the Bible says keep your
[19:30] mind on him keep the mind going keep in
[19:32] mind my pride so we really only live
[19:35] over here a very small portion of our
[19:38] life most of the comments right here but
[19:42] you got to do like brother brown said
[19:43] you you gotta bring everything into the
[19:45] middle
[19:45] anyway because you can't you can't worry
[19:48] about this flash but yet we do we do we
[19:53] worry about this flesh we get a little
[19:55] ache or pain and we get a sore we get
[19:57] this and we go by this and put this on
[19:59] this and that's okay that's fine we live
[20:00] in this but we have to we have to take
[20:03] care of this thing all right we do I
[20:06] mean you know what go say hello and just
[20:09] don't eat and go to feed you no don't
[20:12] say home God sends you so I knocked on
[20:14] the door to get a job no you gotta go
[20:16] out don't don't sit down and say well
[20:19] now God if you want me to go to church
[20:20] you're going to transport me or you go
[20:23] have to bring church here no and then
[20:24] you know what you arrived I and rub down
[20:26] your sleeve so there is parts of this
[20:29] human part that we have to have emotion
[20:35] relation all the thing is over here so
[20:40] if we bring them in the middle and say
[20:42] God please have more control my life
[20:44] than you did yesterday or have more
[20:46] control my life than you did a year ago
[20:47] and listen it's a stepping stone of a
[20:51] process don't get don't get so caught it
[20:57] with the details because you know what
[20:58] you're going to be like this I don't
[20:59] care if you're Christian you're still
[21:00] going to have updates and down day all
[21:02] right but the son of man had bad days
[21:04] too sure I'm sure he did because
[21:09] remember brother branham look at what
[21:11] happened to his body during that
[21:13] ministry of his how old he look Jesus
[21:16] was 30 and look 50 so he had a toll on
[21:20] his body don't tell me Jesus got a
[21:22] pebble dancing but thought I'm God ain't
[21:24] got no problems and everything no the
[21:27] devil was on that body all day long
[21:31] makes and pains and heartaches but you
[21:33] know what he done he said of course he
[21:37] knew he had a course to go he understood
[21:40] I only did what the father tells me to
[21:43] do
[21:43] and when so that's what we got to come
[21:45] to I don't I got my lips if I needed it
