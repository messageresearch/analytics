[6:11] School class and this one is entitled an
[6:16] interval between 6 & 7 we talked about
[6:19] this before but an interval between 6 &
[6:24] 7 this is after the six seals I hope you
[6:29] enjoyed the the six heal just kept
[6:32] opening to me I just but I just had to I
[6:34] had to put a stop to it maybe we'll lap
[6:36] back over when we get into the Seventh
[6:38] Seal but this will not be the sixth seal
[6:42] part 12
[6:42] it's actually an interval and it will
[6:44] not be part of the sixth seal so you
[6:45] might want to take that off of there
[6:48] sometimes when you post it online but
[6:51] there's always something that goes on
[6:53] between N and interval and we'll get
[6:55] into some of that tonight and we'll just
[6:57] kind of talk and we'll go and actually
[6:58] get into the Bible so I've got part of
[7:02] it up here so you can read it but I was
[7:04] looking for a scripture to fit this and
[7:07] this scripture came to mind
[7:11] yeah they got it up so we'll pray and
[7:13] then then we'll read the scripture I
[7:16] hope you get something out of this

[7:22] way Lord is Wednesday night all the

[7:37] revelation Lord let it not be just a
[7:40] meeting of minds let it not be that we

[7:43] it was Wednesday night but all we came
[7:45] to hear from you by the way after you

[8:27] be a busy weekend with the Good Friday
[8:29] coming up and us honor of course we
[8:31] honor your resurrection every every
[8:33] Sunday but this is a side part we set
[8:36] aside Lord to honor the resurrection
[8:39] father we pray that you'd be with us now
[8:41] and bless us take care of us in Jesus
[8:42] name we pray amen so watch this right
[8:46] here that I come upon this and because
[8:48] we remember and we'll we'll see what an
[8:50] interval is because an interval is a gap
[8:52] or a space we'll read that in a minute
[8:54] and Joshua rose early in the morning now
[8:57] let me set this up for you this is when
[9:00] Moses has already died
[9:04] this is in Joshua 3 Moses is dead
[9:07] Joshua's the one that's going to take
[9:09] them over into the Promised Land so this
[9:11] is right before they go into the
[9:13] Promised Land
[9:14] right at the edge right at the river all
[9:17] right and Joshua rose early in the
[9:19] morning and they removed from chittim
[9:20] and came to Jordan he and all the
[9:22] children of Israel and lodged there
[9:23] before they passed over and it came to
[9:26] pass after three days there's your three
[9:28] that the officers went through the host
[9:30] and they commanded the people saying
[9:33] when you see the Ark of the Covenant now
[9:35] what is the Ark of the Covenant the Word
[9:36] of God all right it was a it was a box
[9:39] that looks like this box up here but it
[9:41] was the Word of God it contained the
[9:43] Word of God and he came to pass after
[9:46] three days that the officers went
[9:47] through the host and they commanded the
[9:49] people saying when you see the Ark of
[9:52] the Covenant of the Lord your God and
[9:53] the priests the Levites bearing it
[9:56] preachers then you shall remove from
[10:00] your place and go after it all right get
[10:03] up and go in other words yet there shall
[10:06] be a space between you and it about two
[10:11] thousand cubits by measure come not near
[10:13] into it that you may know the way by
[10:15] which you must go for ye have not passed
[10:18] this way heretofore there's my key but
[10:24] let's continue reading because it's part
[10:25] of it too
[10:26] for you have not passed this way in
[10:28] other words leave a gap or a space
[10:30] because you've not traveled this way
[10:32] before if you get too close you may mess
[10:35] something up let's just give it a space
[10:37] or an interval of time here and Joshua
[10:40] said unto the people sanctify yourself
[10:42] we just got through the sixth seal
[10:44] sanctification sanctify yourself for
[10:47] tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among
[10:49] you he's gonna change your body and
[10:52] Joshua speaking to the priest saying the
[10:54] preachers take up the Ark of the
[10:56] Covenant and Passover before the people
[10:58] and they took up the Ark of the Covenant
[11:00] and went before the people now watch and
[11:01] the Lord said unto Joshua this day will
[11:04] I begin to magnify vena Joshua the type
[11:07] of the Holy Ghost amen that's the type
[11:10] of the Holy Ghost in the end time is
[11:12] Joshua this day will I magnify begin to
[11:15] magnify then the sight of all is
[11:17] that they may know that as I was with
[11:20] Moses so I will be with thee you may be
[11:26] seated in the Lord as a blessing to the
[11:28] reading world as I was with Moses so
[11:31] shall I be with thee
[11:33] in other words Moses da servant is dead
[11:35] the prophets gone he's off the scene so
[11:38] Joshua a type of the baptism of the Holy
[11:41] Ghost is going to take Israel into the
[11:44] Promised Land
[11:45] but he tells them as they get toward
[11:47] Jordan that you need to stand back or
[11:50] leave a space or a gap or an interval
[11:52] between the word and yourself you say
[11:57] well that doesn't that sounds strange
[11:58] it doesn't strange if he's never been
[12:00] that way before because the Levites were
[12:02] the one that we're carrying the art they
[12:04] had been that way before cuz they were
[12:05] out there in the water remember the
[12:08] Bible you keep reading when the priest
[12:10] stuck their foot in the water the waters
[12:14] parted until everybody passed over and
[12:18] then when the ark when the ark and when
[12:21] the heel of the priests come out of the
[12:23] Jordan it come back together hey man so
[12:26] Westway we're gonna go we're not going
[12:28] over here without a preacher and the
[12:32] Word of God you men and all right Louise
[12:35] where do we say he's in the back oh they
[12:38] need some help back there today so they
[12:39] got about six people back there it's
[12:42] kind of crowded yeah they got the light
[12:44] on now they're gonna all right so Joshua
[12:48] this is what I want you to see is that
[12:50] one where it says you have not passed
[12:52] this way heretofore
[12:53] now when we get into the Seventh Seal
[12:55] we're going to see tonight that there
[12:57] was a space between several things that
[13:01] happen between a six and a seven so here
[13:03] we are on the sixth seal and we're
[13:06] looking to the seventh seal and you say
[13:08] oh by the way we've been there before
[13:09] we've never been this close and been
[13:11] there before we've had the seventh seal
[13:14] preached many many times and many many
[13:16] brother Dale preach them in the 80s this
[13:18] is all the way through the seventh seal
[13:20] sixty-two sermons you ought to listen to
[13:22] amen and then but now we've come up to
[13:26] 2019 we're fifty-five years away from
[13:29] since the Prophet showed up there
[13:31] been a gap there's been an interval
[13:33] between when the profit went off the
[13:35] scene and when you and I are finally
[13:36] going to realize that we're gonna have
[13:38] to do the crossing over it's not going
[13:40] to be Moses coming back and doing all
[13:41] the work and crossing us over no it's
[13:44] the preachers with the baptism of the
[13:46] Holy Ghost and the Word of God that's
[13:48] gonna part Jordan and get us out of here
[13:50] I thought the Bible says is Ephesians
[13:54] said for the perfecting of the Saints he
[13:56] give us apostles prophets pastors
[13:59] teachers and evangelists so now let's
[14:02] look at this quote here and look at some
[14:05] of these intervals what's wrong not to
[14:06] be not to be but about an hour maybe
[14:10] pull up where it says interval there we
[14:17] go
[14:18] the word interval means the period of
[14:20] time between two events you have an
[14:24] event on this side and you have an event
[14:26] on this side it's the part in between
[14:28] and the words that are corresponding
[14:30] with this are a pause a gap a space
[14:36] remember that word space seven seals
[14:41] says what silence in heaven for the
[14:43] space of a half an hour all right pause
[14:46] gap space a rest
[14:49] because what happened to Israel when
[14:51] they come up to the Jordan for three
[14:52] days they rested sanctify yourself in
[14:56] other words the other part of the
[14:57] scripture says don't even go into your
[14:58] wife you need to be ready to go
[15:00] sanctified and ready to go across it
[15:03] also means breach we know brother brand
[15:04] preached a breach between the church
[15:06] ages and the seals all right it is also
[15:08] an interlude which means you know what
[15:10] an interlude is between plays when they
[15:13] start getting you know they have like
[15:14] scene number one if they have to bring
[15:17] everybody off the stage and put new
[15:19] equipment up they have an interlude they
[15:21] play that music that puts you to sleep
[15:23] right this music will shouldn't put us
[15:26] to sleep and man this music should wake
[15:28] us up because then that interval a lot
[15:31] of things are going on you might think
[15:32] sitting there looking at the curtain
[15:34] that there's nothing going on but behind
[15:36] that curtain come on people behind that
[15:38] curtain
[15:39] they're moving equipment they're
[15:40] bringing people in they're bringing the
[15:42] actors in there they're they're getting
[15:44] everything ready for that final act all
[15:50] right no preaching all right so now look
[15:55] let's look at the first gap or interval
[15:59] with Matthew 24:29 now we know this is
[16:06] the sixth seal all right this is Matthew
[16:10] 24:29 I want you though to have your
[16:12] Bible go to your Bible because we're
[16:16] gonna read this you don't have to but
[16:17] you just you will I would like for you
[16:20] to on the other ones immediately after
[16:21] the tribulation of those days shall the
[16:23] Sun be darkened moon shall not give her
[16:24] light now remember this is the sixth
[16:26] seal Jesus preached six seals Amen all
[16:30] right something to be darker the moon
[16:32] giver it won't give her light the stars
[16:33] shall fall from heaven we read that in
[16:35] what in revelations six all right for
[16:38] the sixth seal and the powers of the
[16:40] heavens shall be shaken and then shall
[16:41] appear the sign of the Son of man in
[16:43] heaven and then shall all the tribes of
[16:45] the earth mourn and they shall see the
[16:46] Son of man coming in the clouds of
[16:48] heaven with power and great glory and he
[16:50] shall send His angels with a great sound
[16:52] of a trumpet and they shall gather
[16:53] together his elect from the four winds
[16:55] from one end of heaven to the other and
[16:57] they learn a parable of the fig tree now
[16:59] remember the sixth seal stops right here
[17:02] I read you the quote in just a minute
[17:03] the sixth seal stops here he immediately
[17:06] goes to a parable of the fig tree now I
[17:11] want you to put this in the back of your
[17:13] mind
[17:13] everywhere you see an interval or a gap
[17:18] the Holy Ghost is filling that gap all
[17:22] right there's the holy ghost is doing
[17:24] something to fill that gap you don't
[17:26] believe that watch this right remember
[17:29] faith is not an add you add to your
[17:32] faith one two three four five six
[17:35] an interval before the seventh seal
[17:38] before the headstone comes all right so
[17:40] the Holy Ghost is what's going to have
[17:42] to fill that gap in and that's what he's
[17:44] been doing for all these years it's been
[17:45] the Holy Ghost through ministers and
[17:48] through brothers and through all the
[17:49] ones that are there the Holy Ghost fill
[17:51] people that are what trying to get the
[17:53] people ready we're trying to get to
[17:54] Jordan we're trying to cross over it'd
[17:56] be you know it wouldn't have been very
[17:57] good if Joshua just would have just got
[17:59] to Jordan and said look your brother
[18:03] Ryan said we can't cross over no he had
[18:06] a commission his commission was to go
[18:09] into the promised land so he got
[18:10] everything ready and he had an interval
[18:13] there that he had to fill in because
[18:16] they had not went that way before no you
[18:18] and I have not went the way of the body
[18:20] changed before we have not this is new
[18:23] ground that we're trying to cover this
[18:26] is very new ground that we're trying to
[18:29] cover this is not a new revelation but
[18:32] it's new ground that we're trying to
[18:34] cover and then so right here we see end
[18:39] of heaven to the other
[18:40] that's the end of the sixth seal now
[18:43] learn a parable of the fig tree when the
[18:44] branch is yet tender and putteth forth
[18:46] leaves you know that summer is not now
[18:48] what is the fig tree
[18:49] it's Israel what is God going to do he's
[18:53] going to save a hundred and forty-four
[18:56] thousand by the Holy Ghost he's gonna
[18:59] save that fig tree right there at that
[19:01] sixth seal we already said that because
[19:03] remember the six Hills with tribulation
[19:05] seal that's ones 144,000 will be brought
[19:08] out is during that six seal learn a
[19:10] parable then he goes all the way down so
[19:12] likewise when you shall see all these
[19:14] things know that it is new
[19:16] even at the doors verily I say unto you
[19:18] this generation shall not pass till all
[19:21] these things be fulfilled heaven and
[19:25] earth shall pass away but my words shall
[19:27] not pass away but of that day and hour
[19:28] knoweth no man no not the angels of
[19:31] heaven but my father only now listen
[19:33] this is Jesus talking
[19:35] everybody with me this is Jesus still
[19:37] preaching but that's not the Seventh
[19:39] Seal he preached six seals and now he's
[19:44] expounding on Israel but as of the days
[19:48] of Noah were now remember what were the
[19:51] days of Noah think about this the days
[19:54] of Noah is still a mystery to man the
[19:59] hundred and twenty years Noah preached
[20:01] was a space that no one believed what he
[20:05] was talking about yet it was God
[20:07] Almighty trying to get the people
[20:09] listened they'd never been that way
[20:11] before Noah said it's gonna rain and
[20:13] flood the earth
[20:14] the scientists said there's no water up
[20:16] here unbelievable it was an unbelievable
[20:22] 120 year message only eight people
[20:26] believed it out of millions why because
[20:32] science said and my quote book said that
[20:38] there's no rain up there Noah said I
[20:41] don't care this is the message I was
[20:44] given to preach you better get ready
[20:45] because God's gonna destroy this earth
[20:47] with water well as it was in the days of
[20:50] Noah so shall also the coming of the Son
[20:52] of man be that's now this is a mystery
[20:55] like I was talking about Sunday might
[20:58] we're a mystery to people we're a
[21:02] mystery we're not normal
[21:08] some of us more than others but I want
[21:15] to be I want to be God's not not normal
[21:21] but as the days of Noah were what the
[21:24] unbelievable message that was an
[21:26] unbelievable the whole world did not
[21:29] believe Noah except eight people seven
[21:32] and him I hope he believed what he was
[21:34] talking about well he preached it for
[21:36] 120 years so shall also the coming of
[21:39] the Son of man be
[21:40] so listen let me make this a little

[22:24] there were before the flood they were
[22:26] eating and drinking marrying and giving
[22:30] in marriage what same way today until

[22:54] for no not one hour your Lord doth come
[22:59] that Alright say Amen all right let's
[23:02] read the next clue let's read the quote
[23:04] there we're we're brother Branham
[23:07] expound on this in the seventh cell
[23:11] won't step down here that okay I'm gonna
[23:15] stayin I'm not gonna stay in front you
[23:18] go to shouting just let me know I'll
[23:20] move couldn't you remember this morning
[23:22] bringing these things up and watching
[23:24] tonight bringing them up and you find
[23:25] out when he gets to the Seventh Seal she
[23:28] cuts off just Jesus Christ is speaking
[23:30] himself told of the end time we just
[23:33] read that Matthew 24 and when he got
[23:36] told all six seals when he got to the
[23:38] seventh he stopped
[23:40] he stopped now remember he kept talking
[23:43] about the fig tree but the 6a it was
[23:46] over with because there's not anything
[23:48] spoke you know watch we're going to
[23:50] speak here now on the seventh chapter
[23:51] just a minute kind of bridge it between
[23:54] interval sixth and seventh seal because
[23:58] that's the only material we have to go
[24:00] on right now is this between the sixth
[24:03] and seventh seal is the calling out of
[24:05] Israel in other words the Holy Ghost is
[24:07] on the same okay bye all right with that
[24:10] say man because Jesus was the seventh
[24:13] seal he couldn't preach anything about
[24:15] the seventh seal that's why the seventh
[24:17] seal silence it's him it's a person
[24:20] that's what we're looking for we're
[24:21] looking for a person we're not looking
[24:24] for a piece of paper we're looking for a
[24:26] person God living in you like we were
[24:30] talking about let me let me just make
[24:31] that I have some comments on this I'm
[24:37] gonna read them again brother Brown said
[24:39] in Patmos vision what happens when to
[24:41] omnipotence meet when God and man comes
[24:47] together to run impotent something's got
[24:49] to shake yeah you don't have these
[24:52] clothes you you got it from like Sunday
[24:54] whose whatsoever you'd say with that
[24:56] creative power of omnipotence of God
[24:59] knowing that he's promised it and he
[25:01] said it in his word it creates a power
[25:03] that goes out younger and brings things
[25:05] to pass that's what we're looking at
[25:07] that's what we're looking at we're
[25:09] looking at the power going out and
[25:11] creating things
[25:14] limbs can be restored all these
[25:17] different things we can we can look
[25:19] forward to but you know I read a
[25:20] commentary this week and it made a lot
[25:22] of sense
[25:25] God is not omnipotent to the degree that
[25:31] he's all-powerful period
[25:40] come on yeah thanks Frieda seats come on
[25:42] Brother come on brother remember he
[25:46] wants everybody to be safe now an
[25:50] all-powerful we would think would just
[25:53] say I'm will save everybody but he can't
[25:55] go past this word he's omnipotent as far
[25:58] as his word goes because he would that
[26:02] all be saving them does not stand a
[26:04] person will lose all these people no he
[26:06] wished that everybody would be saved so
[26:08] being all-powerful I'd save everybody
[26:10] but he's not because his word says they
[26:13] certain things you got to do remember
[26:14] there's promises that he made and being
[26:17] omnipotent he has to be omnipotent
[26:19] toward his word will show to you you're
[26:21] not all-powerful in the sense that you
[26:24] can do anything you want to you're all
[26:27] powerful because the word gives you that
[26:29] gives you that responsibility whatsoever
[26:31] you say to that creative power of
[26:34] omnipotence of God that's where you get
[26:36] it from so that's why brother Brown said
[26:39] power without character is sought Anik
[26:41] you have that power but you if you have
[26:44] that power and you don't have the
[26:46] character you can do a lot of damage
[26:50] look at Elijah now I sure didn't have
[26:53] the new birth but look at Eli sure God
[26:56] honored that prophet so much till he got
[26:58] mad one day call to she-bears date 42
[27:01] children that was power without
[27:03] character he said well that satanic
[27:05] without look God didn't kill them babies
[27:07] but he honored that prophets word
[27:09] because he put that prophet in the
[27:12] position same way your brother branham
[27:14] he put but now remember he put brother
[27:15] Branham in that same position remember
[27:19] the two kids making love in them
[27:22] he had power to turn them dead he said
[27:28] what remember the Holy Ghost said
[27:30] whatever you say what did he say I
[27:34] forgive you I forgive you he had that
[27:38] power but he had character to go along
[27:41] with it and he said I forgive you for
[27:44] that
[27:44] amen
[27:47] what an example we had all right now
[27:50] look let's pull this bait now let's go
[27:55] so we see Jesus preached six sealed say
[28:00] right there when Jesus preached six
[28:01] seals and then he started talking about
[28:03] the parable the fig tree well he was the
[28:05] seventh seal so there's nothing else to
[28:06] to come that's all there's this just
[28:09] it's just Christ alright but now what
[28:12] about if it's Christ in you the hope of
[28:15] glory then does that not make you part
[28:18] of the seal
[28:19] now look revelation 6 and there in your
[28:22] Bible revelation 6 we just finished this
[28:26] but watch and I beheld when he had
[28:27] opened the sixth seal and lo there was a
[28:29] great earthquake Sun became black as
[28:31] sackcloth of hair and the moon became as
[28:32] blood and the stars of heaven fell unto
[28:34] the earth even as a fig tree casteth her
[28:36] untimely figs when he's shaken of a
[28:37] mighty wind and heaven departed as a
[28:39] scroll when it rolled together and every
[28:41] mountain and Island were moved out of
[28:42] their place and the kings of the earth
[28:43] and the great men and the rich man -
[28:44] chief captains mighty men and every
[28:46] bondman ever Freeman hid themselves I
[28:49] need some oxygen hid themselves in the
[28:50] dens and interrupts of mountains and
[28:52] said to the mountains and rocks fall on
[28:53] us and hide us with the face of him that
[28:55] sitteth on the throne and from the wrath
[28:56] of the lamb was a great day of wrath has
[28:58] come who shall be able to stand now
[29:03] that's the end of the sixth seal in
[29:05] revelations chapter 6 right that's six
[29:09] seals with Revelation chapter 6 now
[29:11] Revelation 7:1 begins like this
[29:15] and after these things there's a gap you
[29:22] don't pick the seventh seal up until
[29:24] revelations 8:1 think about 8:1
[29:30] he put the seventh seal in the eighth
[29:33] chapter something in there but now he
[29:38] the six seals and then revelation seven
[29:40] he entered Jax this right here and after
[29:43] these things I saw four angels standing
[29:45] on the four corners of the earth holding
[29:46] the four winds that the wind should not
[29:50] blow and every mill that's Wars blowing
[29:51] the earth nor on the sea nor any tree
[29:53] and I saw another angel ascending from
[29:55] the east having the seal the Living God
[29:56] and he cried with a loud voice to the
[29:57] four angels to whom it was given to hurt
[29:59] the earth and the sea saying hurt not
[30:01] the earth nor the sea till we have
[30:03] sealed the servants now brother branham
[30:05] watch that servants that's not us that's
[30:10] not us so the sixth seal when you see
[30:13] revelation seven it goes right back to
[30:16] Israel to that 144,000 by the baptism of
[30:20] the Holy Ghost is going to receive a
[30:22] seal till we have sealed the servants
[30:25] we're not servant we're bride Israel its
[30:29] servants so look out with continuity the
[30:32] Bible six seals gap interval and now I
[30:38] said I've heard the number of them which
[30:40] were sealed you're gonna this is going
[30:42] to prove it and they were sealed 144,000
[30:44] of all the tribes of the children of
[30:46] Israel then I didn't put all that
[30:48] there's a whole bunch of the chapter
[30:50] down through there but now go to the
[30:51] next one
[30:51] the next thing is revelations 8:1 and we
[30:54] had opened the Seventh Seal There was
[30:56] silence in heaven about the space of a
[30:58] half an hour because remember let me
[31:03] interject this let me let me interject
[31:05] this in just for a minute when we come
[31:08] to a sixth seal sanctification Christ
[31:11] has to come on the scene
[31:12] it makes him come on the scene in us
[31:16] when Israel gets their sixth seal
[31:19] sanctification
[31:20] the Bible says according to Daniel that
[31:23] Christ comes and fights for Israel he
[31:26] shows up on the scene to Israel
[31:30] through to witness is not not Berta not
[31:33] physically but remember they preach him
[31:35] so much till they say where did you get
[31:37] the scars and the wounds and all those
[31:39] things right and he said in the house of
[31:42] my friends all right so after six seals
[31:45] Christ always shows up but he shows up
[31:48] in the form of the holy ghost in that
[31:50] interval and they all right without hope
[31:53] was not born you some of you some of you
[31:57] could just be a statue but you know what
[32:00] if this don't stir your soul yeah spoons
[32:03] fell out your bow or your shovels fell
[32:04] out of your ditch or whatever we thrown
[32:06] about I like shovel cuz it's bigger okay
[32:12] anyhow
[32:13] and we had opened the Seventh Seal There
[32:15] was silence in heaven about space for
[32:17] half an hour
[32:17] nothing nothing went on but it is in
[32:21] Revelations 8:1 now let's read what the
[32:23] Prophet says when the seventh seal now
[32:27] we notice we notice this being just one
[32:30] verse here we'd like to do something
[32:32] just a little bit before here if you
[32:34] notice we skip the seventh chapter now
[32:38] this is on this this is on the seventh
[32:39] seal alright he's preaching the seventh
[32:42] seal if you know it good thank you if
[32:45] you notice we skip the seventh chapter
[32:47] the sixth chapter ends up the sixth
[32:50] sixth seal but between the sixth seal
[32:52] and the seventh seal there something
[32:54] takes place and how lovely that's placed
[32:57] just at its right place between six and
[33:03] seven chapter now if you notice in the
[33:06] seventh chapter we notice between the
[33:09] sixth and seventh there's an interval an
[33:12] interval between the sixth and seventh
[33:14] chapter of the Book of Revelations and
[33:15] it's between the sixth and seventh seal
[33:17] that this interval is given notice we
[33:21] want to notice this very important that
[33:23] we noticed this little time alright this
[33:26] little time was a time that Israel's
[33:28] brought in but now you and I still you
[33:30] got to remember well this has nothing to
[33:31] do with us we're gone no let me tell you
[33:34] something right now you're in an
[33:36] interval
[33:38] you are in a space of time that we are
[33:41] between time and time shall be no longer
[33:43] we're standing at revelations 10 1
[33:46] through 7 we're standing in that place
[33:49] or that gap right now it's been 55 years
[33:52] since the Prophet left the same
[33:53] something's got to happen amen
[33:57] Noah preached 120 years we're almost
[33:59] halfway there from 120 you got 55 years
[34:04] since the Prophet left I mean come on
[34:06] people we should already Howard you
[34:08] believe five years ago amen
[34:12] all right we okay let's go the next
[34:19] quote still on the Seventh Seal now if
[34:23] you notice in the seventh chapter we
[34:25] noticed between the sixth and seventh
[34:27] there's an interval an interval between
[34:28] the sixth and seventh chapter of the
[34:30] Book of Revelations and it's between the
[34:32] sixth and seventh seal that's this
[34:33] interval is given now we want to notice
[34:35] this this is a redo but I'll add to this
[34:37] part down here very important that we
[34:39] noticed this little time now and we
[34:42] notice this interval now between the
[34:44] sixth and seventh chapter now the
[34:46] seventh chapter of Revelation reveals a
[34:48] happening it's not here just for nothing
[34:52] it's not put in between this for that
[34:54] none of this is put in between anything
[34:57] we're gonna look where brother round did
[34:58] some things and stopped and then did
[34:59] some thing we're gonna stay still in the
[35:01] Bible
[35:02] you got the trumpets you got the vowels
[35:04] all uc6 there's a gap in seven all right
[35:07] but something did happen in that gap all
[35:11] right mm-hmm it's here for a purpose
[35:14] here for a purpose and it's a revelation
[35:17] that reveals something what that the
[35:20] Holy Ghost is on it the scene more
[35:23] prevalent than any other time because
[35:25] we've squeezed him into a gap and then
[35:29] if you let water just flow down a big
[35:31] wide stream you know you go to the
[35:33] Chattahoochee River down below Atlanta
[35:34] and that thing's about 300 feet wide and
[35:37] it just looks like this but when you go
[35:40] up here where we're fishing huh and it's
[35:44] about this wide going through them rocks
[35:47] it's a rushing mighty water and then so
[35:50] that's what we've come to why because
[35:51] it's been squeezed in you and I have
[35:53] this is the place we've been squeezed in
[35:54] this is the gap we're either gonna cross
[35:57] over or we're gonna stay on this side
[35:59] now how mysterious and how mathematical
[36:02] it fits right in the scripture
[36:04] exactly you believe in God's mathematics
[36:07] if you don't you're sure lost in the
[36:09] you'll sure get lost in the word if you
[36:12] start putting a four or six or something
[36:14] besides just a mathematical word running
[36:17] an order you'll sure have and you're
[36:19] seeing a count picking grass on top of a
[36:21] tree somewhere your shirt you'll
[36:23] certainly run out because God does not
[36:25] his whole word does not run completely
[36:27] in mathematics it does run completely in
[36:29] mathematics sorry yes sir perfect the
[36:32] most perfect there's no other literature
[36:34] written like it like it's so perfect in
[36:36] mathematics now the eighth chapter only
[36:40] reveals the scene I want you to keep
[36:42] that in your mind it reveals the scene
[36:45] of the seventh seal remember I was
[36:48] talking about acts of a play you got one
[36:50] Act one Church age then the curtain
[36:52] falls then yeah they take that equipment
[36:54] off when they bring another piece of
[36:56] equipment in then they had open the
[36:57] thing there's an interval all right well
[37:01] you and I are in the interval we're not
[37:02] between the six and seven Church age but
[37:05] we're between standing in the seventh
[37:08] church age and eternity now look nothing
[37:12] where nothing else is revealed nothing
[37:16] is not revealed in the seventh seal now
[37:19] has nothing to do with the seventh
[37:21] chapter revelations
[37:22] it's the revealing of the seventh seal
[37:24] is perfectly mute
[37:27] and we're gonna get into that when we
[37:29] get into the Seventh Seal if I only had
[37:31] time I'll try in a few places to show
[37:34] you all the way back from Genesis this
[37:36] seventh chapter of this Seventh Seal is
[37:38] spoke up from the very beginning in
[37:41] Genesis those seals moved right up if
[37:44] you've never heard that sermon preached
[37:45] you need to listen to one brother Dale
[37:47] preaches on the seals in the book of
[37:48] Genesis
[37:48] because I'll guarantee you it takes you
[37:50] right back to the first of Genesis and
[37:51] put so seals right in order and man
[37:54] because what the seals are the Word of
[37:56] God folks it's not something that's not
[37:58] written amen so now you got six seals
[38:05] then you've got an interval where you
[38:09] bring Israel in then you got the seventh
[38:12] seal now you and I are not here in time
[38:15] when that let me slow down a minute we
[38:18] are not here in time when that happens
[38:21] we've been through this and through this
[38:23] we twelve sermon we're not here when
[38:27] 144,000 are saved when nine 44,000 are
[38:30] saved we are not here we are over in
[38:32] another dimension at the wedding supper
[38:34] while God brings tribulation on the
[38:37] earth they men while he does his
[38:39] three-part thing he what he purchased
[38:41] the he purchased the 144,000 he
[38:45] purchased the foolish virgin and he
[38:47] purchased the earth because then we're
[38:50] gone then we come back onto the earth
[38:54] for the Millennium thereby got that say
[38:56] man all right we've had we've been
[38:59] talking about the whole thing the six
[39:00] seals the Tribulation Period we are not
[39:01] here during that time but you and I are
[39:03] under now a sixth seal purging of what's
[39:06] in you
[39:08] we're all under that we got us to have a
[39:11] sixth seal purging the most the greatest
[39:13] purging there ever was that'll purge
[39:15] your old self out and what you'll stand
[39:18] is a 20-year old person and all the
[39:22] older ones said and all the younger ones
[39:25] said
[39:30] maybe that's why God let us get older
[39:32] that we'd appreciate the body changed a
[39:35] lot more and then at 20 years old you're
[39:37] just gonna be twenty years old but if
[39:40] you're 79 and close behind way in front
[39:48] district leader back there in the back
[39:51] she acts like she's 20 already out walk
[39:56] any of us I'm promise you that but we
[40:00] have a scene here at the eighth chapter
[40:02] brings the seventh ceiling we're gonna
[40:03] get to talking that but there is an
[40:05] interval a gap between the sixth seal
[40:08] and the Seventh Seal thereby all right
[40:10] with that all right now let's go and
[40:12] move on - I just want kind of hit the
[40:14] highlights no maybe we'll hit it again
[40:16] so we don't not so long tonight now
[40:18] let's go and move to the trumpets now
[40:23] pull these up for you but I've got them
[40:25] in my Bible and I saw this a long time
[40:28] ago and I marked it all in the Bible and
[40:31] you can mark it in if you want to
[40:33] revelations chapter 9 now remember all
[40:39] trumpets sound under the sixth seal so
[40:42] those trumpets listen to me watch look
[40:44] at me all trumpets sound on the sixth
[40:47] seal that is to Israel they get you and
[40:51] I have the Feast of the trumpets but
[40:53] they are under one two three four five
[40:56] six seven trumpets all right and the
[40:58] seven trumpets are as the seven seals
[41:00] are to us right
[41:02] amen everybody got that time we read
[41:04] your quote in a minute where brother
[41:05] Brown said their Seventh Seal in ours I
[41:07] mean their seventh trumpet and our
[41:09] seventh seal same thing all right and
[41:11] we're going to read it so here we got
[41:13] revelations 9 verse 13
[41:17] because remember listen hold on just
[41:19] second I forgot to bring this into wrote
[41:22] myself a note and a lobster nope but
[41:24] remember God dealt with Israel in the
[41:28] Old Testament right God dealt with
[41:31] Israel in the Old Testament let me see
[41:33] if I'm fine my my scripture here and
[41:35] Isaiah 54 6 listen to list it's not up
[41:38] here but you just listen Isaiah 54 6
[41:42] through 8 I just found this a few
[41:44] minutes ago I wanted something else to
[41:45] tie this together and while I'm talking
[41:47] if they want to bring it up see if you
[41:49] can find it brother Anderson Isaiah 54 6
[41:53] I want you to read this now remember God
[41:58] put everything he had on Israel in the
[42:01] Old Testament then he had to put him
[42:05] away there was an interval of 7 Church
[42:10] ages before he started dealing with
[42:12] Israel again and then so see if he can
[42:15] put that up I was there 54 6 but the
[42:23] Lord have called thee as a woman
[42:25] Forsaken and grieved in spirit and a
[42:27] wife of youth when thou was refused
[42:30] saith the Lord
[42:32] Isaiah 54 7-4 a small moment
[42:42] gap interval space of time for a small
[42:47] interval
[42:49] how about forsaken thee but with great
[42:53] mercy will I gather thee in a little
[42:58] wrath I hid my face from thee for a
[43:01] moment but with everlasting kindness
[43:04] will I have mercy on thee saith the Lord
[43:07] thy Redeemer and man that's what a bit I
[43:11] was looking for because God he didn't
[43:13] forget him but he said I forsaken thee
[43:15] for a small moment what he forsaken them
[43:18] at the cross they forsake him first
[43:20] forsook him first right
[43:22] he had to put her away in marriage
[43:24] Gentile bride but he didn't forget
[43:25] Israel he can't they can't be his wife
[43:28] again but he can't forsake them but with
[43:30] great mercy will I gather they watch
[43:32] what's he doing nice gathering them in
[43:35] so there was an interval between Christ
[43:38] on the cross and when we get out of here
[43:41] there's a gap of time in there that
[43:43] God's not dealing with Israel God's not
[43:46] dealing with there's one else a nation
[43:48] individuals yes nation no he will not
[43:51] deal with it was an end of it of the
[43:52] nation till we leave then what's he
[43:55] gonna do he's gonna show up at the end
[43:58] of that sick sale he's gonna show up and
[44:00] fight for Israel that's what the Bible
[44:01] says that all right somebody you're
[44:04] looking a little cross-eyed study your
[44:06] Bible but that's the truth as I'm
[44:09] reading it from the Bible okay argue
[44:12] with it wrote it I'm just reading it so
[44:16] the trumpets let's go back to the
[44:17] trumpets now revelations now because all
[44:19] the trumpets are to Israel one two three
[44:23] four five six seven and the sixth angel
[44:26] sounded I just put took a piece of this
[44:28] to save for time and the sixth angel
[44:31] sounded and I heard a voice from the
[44:33] four horns of the golden altar which is
[44:35] before God saying to the sixth angel the
[44:39] sixth trumpet which had the trumpet
[44:41] loose the four angels which are bound in
[44:44] the river Euphrates there's your war
[44:49] Winsor war he's loosing all the war well
[44:52] I like the six seal if the sixth seal
[44:55] and the six trumpets the same thing if
[44:57] the six seals the tribulation and the
[44:59] purging of Israel so with the six angel
[45:02] that blowed the trumpet loose four
[45:04] angels which are bound in the river
[45:06] Euphrates and then so now you would say
[45:12] now the next thing what happened would
[45:14] be is the seventh angel would sound no
[45:20] there's an interval and what is that
[45:23] interval I hope you know this one
[45:26] revelations 10 and I saw another mighty
[45:31] angel come down from heaven clothed with
[45:33] a cloud and a rainbow upon his head and
[45:34] his face was it were son Peters pillars
[45:36] of fire we know all that's it happened
[45:38] in Revelations 10 there in that interval
[45:41] between 6 and 7 there's a prophet
[45:44] interjected in there amen
[45:47] revelations 10 7 and in the days of the
[45:50] voice of the seventh angel now that's
[45:52] not the seventh angel they blow the
[45:53] trumpet no no no no no because he's
[45:56] going to show up a little bit later but
[45:58] this is the special revelations 10:1
[46:00] because listen we say well you say well
[46:04] brother way this is all to the bride
[46:05] remember we're not here
[46:08] that's the Israel they're gonna get a
[46:11] mighty angel they're gonna get Christ
[46:13] he's gonna come down you don't believe
[46:16] that go to the Book of Daniel the Book
[46:18] of Daniel it tells the same man plus one
[46:20] for the wind one foot on sea and he
[46:23] swears by time time and a half because
[46:25] they get a time time times and a
[46:28] dividing of times let me read that right
[46:30] amen same man though same angel they
[46:36] don't get a different Christ then we get
[46:37] when Christ comes back to them he comes
[46:40] back as the mighty angel come down from
[46:43] heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[46:45] rainbow upon his head and you remember
[46:46] all those things happen so now remember
[46:50] during that interval
[46:53] God sends something but in the days of
[46:57] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[46:59] shall begin to sound the mystery of God
[47:00] to be finished that's what turns them
[47:05] that's what turns them to the mighty
[47:08] angel that's what turns us to the mighty
[47:11] angel they man not brother branham's the
[47:14] mighty angel because remember John takes
[47:18] the bulk from that mighty angel he
[47:21] doesn't take the book from the set of
[47:22] church age messenger huh I'll prove it
[47:26] to you you just keep reading John took
[47:29] the book from that mighty angel and
[47:32] brother bran said who is that only
[47:33] Christ could that be
[47:35] and you see how God hid that because you
[47:37] know what if I was writing the Bible
[47:38] that'd be a big a but God hid it in
[47:42] simplicity and made it a little a and it
[47:45] took a little profit in the end time to
[47:49] say that's Christ because he's got the
[47:53] same characteristics as over in
[47:55] Revelation chapter 1 so he could put
[47:57] them right together alright so they're
[47:59] in Revelations 10 there's an
[48:00] interjection between the sixth trumpet
[48:02] and the seventh trumpet Christ comes and
[48:06] brings a message to me and you but
[48:09] Christ also comes and takes the message
[48:10] to Israel amen because look revelations
[48:15] 1116 and the seventh angel sounded now
[48:19] this is not brother Branham this is not
[48:21] the seventh messenger this is the
[48:23] seventh angel sounded the trumpet and
[48:25] there were great voices in heaven saying
[48:27] the kingdoms of this world are become
[48:29] the kingdom of our Lord and of his
[48:30] Christ and he shall reign forever and
[48:33] ever and the four and twenty elders
[48:35] which set before God on their seats fell
[48:38] upon their faces and worshipped God
[48:39] saying we give thee thanks O Lord God
[48:41] Almighty who art and wast and art to
[48:43] come now that's the son of man because
[48:47] thou has taken to thee thy great power
[48:50] and have reign the prophet of God said
[48:53] to seventh seal and the seventh trumpet
[48:58] it's the same thing that's what Israel
[49:01] gets the seven seals what we get we get
[49:03] Christ but we get the same thing listen
[49:05] when the seventh seal
[49:06] has been open to you the kingdoms of
[49:09] this world are become the kingdom of our
[49:11] Lord and of his Christ and he shall
[49:13] reign forever and ever what through you
[49:15] and four and twenty elders which set
[49:17] before God on their seats
[49:18] what's the twenty-four elders twelve
[49:20] apostles twelve patriarchs that's
[49:22] everybody in the Bible twelve in the Old
[49:24] Testament twelve and a new alright so
[49:26] you got the whole Bible standing there
[49:27] which sat before God on their seats fell
[49:30] upon their faces and worshipped God
[49:31] saying we give thee thanks O Lord God
[49:33] Almighty which art and wast and art to
[49:35] come because thou has taken to thee thy
[49:39] great power and that's rain and then
[49:41] they're okay with that say man so the
[49:44] revelations 9 was the sixth trumpet
[49:47] revelations Tim was interjected where
[49:50] Christ comes by the Holy Ghost through a
[49:51] prophet brings us a message by the Holy
[49:54] Ghost brings the message to Israel
[49:56] through two prophets and then that
[49:59] sounds because look folks this is
[50:04] millennium this is the millennium all
[50:08] the world powers are done away with in
[50:10] that interval the Battle of Armageddon
[50:14] all the forces are gone then when we
[50:17] come back in the Millennium this is
[50:19] what's going to happen the kingdoms of
[50:21] this world are become the kingdoms of
[50:23] our Lord he's going to sell on his
[50:24] throne as the son of David and rule and
[50:25] reign over the whole world but you know
[50:27] what hidden in simplicity and hidden in
[50:31] between the lines in a love letter is
[50:34] you and I hey man that's where the love
[50:37] letter is we can read that all day if
[50:39] you don't have a revelation of who you
[50:41] are you'll think that's talking about
[50:42] somebody else but it's talking about you
[50:44] and me I told you folks you and I are
[50:53] the mystery of this whole thing Satan
[50:55] can't believe that that's us hidden in
[50:58] there somewhere and simplicity no by all
[51:02] rights Amen all right let's read number
[51:04] four
[51:04] we're doing good I'll be out of here in
[51:07] a minute now Feast of the trumpets
[51:13] now you'll have to really we're gonna
[51:17] slow down here just a second because
[51:19] brother branham brings out some things
[51:21] in the Feast of the trumpets people said
[51:22] he made a lot of mistakes but he did not
[51:24] you just not listening to what he said I
[51:27] said you I mean us we're just not
[51:29] listening to what he said there were
[51:33] three stages of it as I said now what's
[51:39] he talking about he's talking about
[51:40] Church ages yeah I'm sorry
[51:43] they talk about the church ages the
[51:44] martyrs the age of the martyr for it
[51:48] then the stage of the reformers who
[51:51] Luther and Wesley come up to Pentecost
[51:54] and now now the calling out time that's
[51:59] what it is now now brother Browns
[52:00] message called out a group of people
[52:02] amen and when finished at Laodicean age
[52:06] according to revelations 10 the mystery
[52:09] of all the Bible would be no to the
[52:12] bride not one person to the bride is
[52:19] that right congregation says all right
[52:22] revelations 10 listen close now huh huh
[52:24] bride called out by the word Christ
[52:29] himself calling out the bride making
[52:34] plain Hebrews 13:8 that he's the same
[52:36] yesterday today and forever the I am
[52:41] does the same is the same
[52:45] he that believeth on me the works that I
[52:47] do shall he do also why do you tie that
[52:49] in huh Luke 22 or Luke 17 30 and also
[52:55] Malachi 4 Hebrews 4 and 12 whoa all
[52:58] these scriptures this promise this is to
[53:01] be between the sixth and seventh seal
[53:04] and the sixth and seventh trumpet neighs
[53:09] exactly right so that's how I just
[53:11] proved it to you he's calling out of
[53:14] people but through the message that goes
[53:16] to the two prophets of number five
[53:17] Elijah they're gonna call out a group of
[53:19] people all right and you know what
[53:21] they're gonna say Hebrews 13:8
[53:24] you got to remember listen just for one
[53:25] second those people in Israel right now
[53:28] do not read now they may read the New
[53:30] Testament as they commentary but they
[53:32] don't think that's the Word of God right
[53:34] the Orthodox Jew now they can tell you
[53:37] everything it says in the Torah and all
[53:38] the old prophets but now this New
[53:40] Testament thing but what's God's going
[53:42] to turn them from what God turned you
[53:45] from an old message to a new message
[53:50] memory turn to hearts heart other
[53:55] children look back to the Pentecostal
[53:57] father's pentecost feast now remember
[54:00] you and i listen you and i have been
[54:03] celebrating since the day of pentecost
[54:06] we've already been through this and
[54:07] we'll go through one more time the day
[54:09] of pentecost fell 8030 we have been
[54:12] under a Pentecostal feast from then
[54:15] until now but now you'll also hear
[54:18] brother Branham tell you that we're
[54:19] under the feast of what Tabernacles
[54:21] because that is the last feast of the
[54:24] ingathering were you set in a booth okay
[54:29] all right everybody get that all right
[54:32] chewing a little bit Pentecost feast
[54:35] finishes at the period of the seventh
[54:38] trumpet for the next is the coming the
[54:40] seventh seal for the next is the mystery
[54:43] of the coming of Christ all right
[54:46] Pentecost feast finishes at the period
[54:48] of the seventh trumpet for the next is
[54:52] the coming the seventh seal for the next
[54:54] is comes remember what is the seventh
[54:56] seal look we'll read it the seventh seal
[54:58] to come to the Lord the end of all
[55:00] things the end to the struggling the
[55:01] world will read all these ends that it's
[55:03] the end up but the seven seals are
[55:04] coming of Christ six seals finishes
[55:08] Redemption seventh seal brings you back
[55:10] to earth we'll read that in a minute all
[55:12] right I think I got it or a male lifted
[55:14] the seventh seal for the next is to the
[55:17] mystery of the coming of rocks now
[55:19] what's the mystery of the coming across
[55:20] you you're the mystery of the coming
[55:23] Christ
[55:23] everybody's looking for Christ to come
[55:25] through the clouds I talked to a guy
[55:27] listen hi he stood right in front of me
[55:28] he said I'll be so glad when God flirts
[55:31] the eastern sky and he just comes
[55:33] walking right down on this earth I
[55:35] looked at him and I said
[55:37] I won't call his name I said according
[55:40] to my Bible you missed it you don't want
[55:44] to be here when that coming is told the
[55:46] whole world's gonna see I go back to the
[55:49] thief and the night that's when he's
[55:51] gonna come and get us
[55:52] he's gonna get us as the thief in the
[55:54] night we're not gonna see apart these
[55:55] from Sky come walking down through if we
[55:57] do that we've missed it but if that
[56:00] happens we're with him for the next is a
[56:04] mystery of the caisson he will not leave
[56:06] his bride she's always with him and also
[56:12] the trumpet is sound for the Jews God's
[56:15] gonna sound the trumpet to the Jews
[56:18] while they're on earth get the baptism
[56:20] of the Holy Ghost
[56:21] all right between the six and seven then
[56:25] the seventh is that we're gonna all be
[56:27] in the Millennium right I just read that
[56:30] their sixth trumpet is sound and when it
[56:32] does it makes known to them the reveal
[56:35] son of God now what is their sixth
[56:37] trumpet same as the sixth seal
[56:39] tribulation period to the world but the
[56:41] sounding of that trumpet is through two
[56:43] prophets to reveal Christ to the 144,000
[56:47] thereby all right with that all right
[56:49] there are six trumpet is sound and when
[56:52] it does it makes known to them the
[56:54] revealed Son of God see they don't get a
[56:58] revelation of son of man they get a
[57:00] revelation son of God because that's
[57:03] what was a revelation down through the
[57:05] seven church ages except for right there
[57:07] at the very end where brother Dale has
[57:08] been preaching right here we get what
[57:11] you and our garden human flesh and the
[57:17] word was made flesh and what among
[57:20] listen I wouldn't be preaching in front
[57:22] of you people if I didn't know the word
[57:24] wasn't fleshing somebody it would be a
[57:27] mute point moot point
[57:29] it would be definitely silence sometimes
[57:34] it's that way anyway it makes notes on
[57:42] them the reveal son of God one half-hour
[57:44] of space he brings that so close to that
[57:47] seventh seal
[57:48] remember all trumpets sound on this
[57:51] sixth seal
[57:53] the sixth seal finishes the mystery the
[58:01] sixth seal when it breaks to us
[58:04] redemption is over you'll get a body
[58:08] change because seven is going to step on
[58:10] the scene and when the seventh seal
[58:11] steps on the scene it's that mighty
[58:13] angel its Christ and he's not a second
[58:15] person he's you
[58:21] she is him I said the seventh seal is a
[58:27] person I didn't tell you it was yet not
[58:28] yet the sixth seal finishes the mystery
[58:31] the sixth trumpet when it sounds to
[58:34] Israel it's finished their mystery okay
[58:37] under the sixth seal just before the
[58:39] seventh is open now there's where a lot
[58:42] of people get the quote that the Seventh
[58:44] Seal hadn't open yet well then we just
[58:50] do away with Christ okay
[58:54] remember God does it reveals it and then
[58:58] makes it manifest you got to go through
[59:00] those three things does it reveals it
[59:03] makes it manifest you know what he does
[59:05] it he opened it when the Prophet opened
[59:07] it that night on the seventh seal he
[59:09] opened the seal does it it took 55 years
[59:13] for somebody to get it reveals it and
[59:15] then those people are going to make it
[59:17] manifest I'll promise you it will not be
[59:21] thus saith the Lord it will be you say
[59:25] to the mountain it will be you say to
[59:26] the squirrel you say to the porkchop you
[59:28] say to the drink you need you say to the
[59:30] gas in the gas can but remember power
[59:37] with characters fit to rule you'll know
[59:39] what to do with it when he comes we get
[59:42] these seals right people and then we're
[59:44] in position for that thing to break
[59:47] Joshua had to get Israel together
[59:51] if you'll continue reading Joshua three
[59:53] and four and up two and three and four
[59:55] he had to get those people together get
[59:58] him ready and then he said let them
[1:00:03] priests going out a little bit further
[1:00:04] because y'all never been this way before
[1:00:07] let then in other words let them
[1:00:09] preachers go out there and get it and
[1:00:12] then fill that gap in hey man we had a
[1:00:17] prophet in the end time he went right to
[1:00:19] that future home he went right to that
[1:00:23] future home preached us right to the
[1:00:25] future home but he had to go off the
[1:00:27] scene you know why because we kept
[1:00:28] looking to him not to Christ just where
[1:00:31] it is because remember it's not one
[1:00:34] person this is not a one person message
[1:00:36] it used to be it's not anymore
[1:00:39] it's a Brydon message amen where was a
[1:00:45] number four that number four yes all
[1:00:48] right let's go to number five
[1:00:49] continuation feast of the trumpets oh
[1:00:51] god how can we say this to make the
[1:00:54] people see it now brother Branham has
[1:00:56] got a revelation he's fixing to tell
[1:00:57] people but you don't know how to say it
[1:00:59] that's what he just said Oh God how can
[1:01:01] we say this to make the people see it
[1:01:03] it's between this sixth trumpet and the
[1:01:07] sixth trumpet and sixth trumpet and the
[1:01:09] seventh seal sounds at the same time I
[1:01:12] just told you that six trumpeting the
[1:01:14] sixth seal same thing and between the
[1:01:17] sixth trumpet and the seventh trumpet
[1:01:19] there's a prophet that appears before
[1:01:21] the Gentiles
[1:01:22] that's revelations 10 we just I just
[1:01:24] told you that all right to call the
[1:01:27] people back to the original Pentecostal
[1:01:30] doctrine and the to witness of
[1:01:33] revelations 11 appear to the Jews same
[1:01:35] gap that's why I said revelations 10 is
[1:01:38] not only to us if to Israel they get a
[1:01:41] message that turns our heart back to
[1:01:45] call the people back to the original
[1:01:46] Pentecostal doctrine so what's the two
[1:01:49] witnesses going to do same thing they're
[1:01:51] gonna turn back to say hey you missed it
[1:01:53] at Pentecost right the Jews missed it as
[1:01:58] a nation at Pentecost
[1:02:01] and those two witnesses of revelations
[1:02:03] eleven appeared to the Jews to send them
[1:02:05] to Jesus while the church is being taken
[1:02:08] up all of them profits what one prophet
[1:02:11] to us two prophets to Israel the word of
[1:02:14] the Lord cannot be broken it won't be a
[1:02:16] denomination do you see it
[1:02:18] read in your book here and see if that
[1:02:21] between the 6th and 7th trumpet isn't
[1:02:23] interjected in there let the Jews being
[1:02:25] called out between the 6th and 7th
[1:02:27] played now he might he made a mistake
[1:02:29] that's not at the plague
[1:02:31] that's the 6th and 7th trumpet we come
[1:02:35] over to that 144,000 because that's
[1:02:37] where they were called out from which
[1:02:39] was between that do you remember between
[1:02:42] the 6 the 5th seal in the 6th seal he
[1:02:45] stops between the 6th and he's like me
[1:02:47] he's trying to get in hurry between the
[1:02:49] 6th and the 7th seal there was a calling
[1:02:51] out remember when we stopped at the 6th
[1:02:54] seal that was a fig tree all right when
[1:02:58] we stopped at the 6th seal two prophets
[1:03:00] come on the scene in Revelations calling
[1:03:03] out 144,000 you remember that now there
[1:03:05] is where these trumpets come in right
[1:03:07] here say in persecution and horses
[1:03:09] loosed on them remember brother Branham
[1:03:12] thought he needed to preach all seven
[1:03:15] trumpets remember he was going to he
[1:03:18] said we'll get a building we're gonna
[1:03:20] try to do it he said now I know why he
[1:03:22] said cuz God spoke to me and said you
[1:03:24] preached them already supernaturally in
[1:03:26] the sixth seal and they're not even to
[1:03:29] us except for spiritual application
[1:03:32] they're to the Jews because the the
[1:03:35] trumpets have always been to the Jews
[1:03:37] they've always gathered under their
[1:03:38] trumpet but you and I get a message
[1:03:43] everybody with that say man that
[1:03:46] goodwill okay we got an instrument in
[1:03:48] that interval is a gap a space but
[1:03:52] something's going on during that time
[1:03:56] today let's go to the bowels revelation
[1:03:59] 16 we'll be done in just second
[1:04:03] revelation 16 verse 12 through 17 and
[1:04:07] the sixth angel poured out his vial upon
[1:04:09] the great river Euphrates and the water
[1:04:11] thereof was dried up that the way of the
[1:04:13] kings of the East must be prepared
[1:04:16] that's the six vial
[1:04:19] stop and I saw three nine three unclean
[1:04:23] spirits like frogs come out you and I
[1:04:26] would think that was a continuous
[1:04:27] reading but I'm a reed where brother
[1:04:28] Bram stopped it because this is the this
[1:04:32] is the interval between the sixth angel
[1:04:35] poured out this vial and the seventh
[1:04:37] angel and I saw three unclean spirits
[1:04:39] like frogs you know what brother Brown
[1:04:40] would read what he said that was come
[1:04:42] out of the mouth you said brother that
[1:04:43] brother down what's this got to do with
[1:04:45] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost revealed who
[1:04:47] those were there was a revelation how in
[1:04:51] the world meeting you read I saw three
[1:04:52] unclean spirits like frogs
[1:04:53] how in the world would we know that was
[1:04:55] a water baptism in the name of the
[1:04:57] Father Son Holy go our Trinitarian or
[1:05:00] Trinitarian frog it took a prophet
[1:05:05] because you stopped the sixth angel
[1:05:07] poured out his vial and I saw three
[1:05:10] unclean spirits like frogs come out of
[1:05:12] the mouth of the dragon and out of the
[1:05:14] mouth of the Beast and out of the mouth
[1:05:15] of the false prophet for they are the
[1:05:18] spirits of devils now hmm we're all home
[1:05:24] folks here if there was a denominational
[1:05:27] person sitting in here today they've
[1:05:29] never read that like we read it never
[1:05:32] have they read that's their Trinitarian
[1:05:35] doctrine hey man never have they read
[1:05:38] that and don't try to convert them by
[1:05:42] reading that at first let them read it
[1:05:46] for they are the spirits of Devil's
[1:05:48] working miracles which go forth unto the
[1:05:51] kings of the earth and of the whole
[1:05:53] world this whole world is deceived by
[1:05:58] the water baptism and by the Trinity
[1:06:01] this whole world is deceived and if you
[1:06:05] and I don't believe that you're God and
[1:06:06] not another person you're deceived
[1:06:12] Wow why would you not want we lived all
[1:06:16] this time while we fought all these
[1:06:19] battles to not know that God's here
[1:06:22] doing the work but he's doing it through
[1:06:24] us a man for they're the spirits of
[1:06:28] Devil's working miracles which go forth
[1:06:29] unto the kings of the earth and of the
[1:06:31] whole world to gather them to the Battle
[1:06:33] of that great day of God Almighty we
[1:06:35] know what that is
[1:06:36] behold I come as a thief now here it is
[1:06:39] this behold I come as a thief blessed is
[1:06:42] he that watcheth and keepeth his
[1:06:44] garments lest he walk naked and they see
[1:06:46] his shame and he gathered them together
[1:06:48] into a place called in the Hebrew tongue
[1:06:50] Armageddon
[1:06:52] now remember between the sixth seal
[1:06:56] sixth trumpet and the seventh seal on
[1:07:00] the seventh trumpet
[1:07:02] there's tribulation right six seals
[1:07:06] tribulation then it just pours right
[1:07:08] over into a battle well that's the same
[1:07:10] thing with the vowels it's it's going
[1:07:13] from six flowing around and what is the
[1:07:14] Battle of it's the Battle of that old
[1:07:18] doctrine I'll read it to you and to
[1:07:22] gather them together in a place called
[1:07:23] Hebrew tongue Armageddon
[1:07:25] there's your interval then and the
[1:07:28] seventh angel poured out his vial into
[1:07:30] the air and there came a great voice out
[1:07:33] of the Temple of Heaven from the throne
[1:07:34] saying it is done it is finished it is
[1:07:41] over it is the end it is the seventh
[1:07:45] seal it has been reproduced Christ has
[1:07:49] been reproduced on this earth and then
[1:07:51] so there's your gap now let's read what
[1:07:54] brother Brown said about that northern
[1:07:57] ones at the end time now notice here's
[1:07:58] something real quick while we're ending
[1:08:00] with our talk me too now notice
[1:08:03] revelation 16 13 to 14 if you want to
[1:08:06] put that down I don't have time maybe to
[1:08:09] go to it I want you to be sure and see
[1:08:10] it now notice this is sounding between
[1:08:12] the sixth and seventh vial he's going to
[1:08:14] show us what happened in the interval
[1:08:15] now we'll close out just in a minute if
[1:08:18] you can just bear a few minutes longer
[1:08:19] closing out now know
[1:08:21] revelation 16:13 2:14 between the 6th
[1:08:24] and 7th pile three unclean spirits like
[1:08:27] frogs did you notice that went out of
[1:08:29] the mouths of someone
[1:08:30] now notice quickly are you ready say man
[1:08:33] a trinity of spirits in Trinitarians
[1:08:39] were going trying to slide down in the
[1:08:42] seat because who was he talking to 90%
[1:08:48] of them were Trinitarians and this was
[1:08:53] in jeffersonville so they were there too
[1:08:54] you know
[1:08:55] now denominational brother sit still
[1:08:57] just a minute don't get up and walk out
[1:09:00] of the room back there on this radio
[1:09:03] telephone hookup don't turn your tape
[1:09:05] recorder off that still just a minute
[1:09:08] listen you're born of God you will roll
[1:09:14] on the a Trinity of frogs a frog is an
[1:09:18] animal that always looks backward it
[1:09:20] never looks where he's going he looks
[1:09:22] where he's come from see don't you see
[1:09:25] where was trinitarianism born remember
[1:09:30] three unclean spirits individual spirits
[1:09:33] are you getting it congregation says
[1:09:36] notice they look back to the Nicene
[1:09:39] Council where the Trinity doctrine was
[1:09:41] born out not in the Bible there's no
[1:09:45] such a thing they look back to the
[1:09:48] Nicene council it and i see a room where
[1:09:50] the trinity was born notice where they
[1:09:54] came from notice and the Trinity of
[1:09:56] frogs came out of an old Trinity gave
[1:10:01] birth to a new trinity their mother what
[1:10:07] had come out of a Trinity the Dragons
[1:10:10] see the beast and the false prophet a
[1:10:13] trinity knew and if you don't be careful
[1:10:17] you're gonna get caught in that interval
[1:10:19] and you're gonna make a trinity
[1:10:26] your God Almighty and human flesh that
[1:10:30] makes you one with God not one with
[1:10:32] three I could say something a lot
[1:10:37] stronger but I'm not going to
[1:10:39] we can't interject somebody else in
[1:10:41] there either it's you and Christ alone
[1:10:44] and that's it
[1:10:45] the man don't make a new Trinity look
[1:10:50] what it is it's false but when there
[1:10:53] were these frogs come out when did it
[1:10:55] notice they was there all the time but
[1:11:01] it wasn't manifested until between the
[1:11:04] 6th and 7th file just before the seals
[1:11:07] open to revealing amen
[1:11:11] that all right the Holy Ghost had to
[1:11:17] come on the scene through a prophet and
[1:11:19] reveal in that interval what that
[1:11:24] doctrine is that's what I'm saying to
[1:11:26] you tonight in that interval that we're
[1:11:29] in right now all false doctrine has to
[1:11:31] be done away with doesn't matter what
[1:11:33] you think what I think all false
[1:11:35] doctrine has to be done away with you
[1:11:38] cannot take a body change until you get
[1:11:40] all false doctrine out of the way
[1:11:42] all right just for a few things right
[1:11:48] here and then we'll then we'll close go
[1:11:50] to the next little I kind of pulled
[1:11:52] these up if you ever thought of this
[1:11:54] brother branham preaches individual
[1:11:56] church ages he preaches one two three
[1:11:58] four five six now this is not the book
[1:12:00] the church age book this is the actual
[1:12:02] messages he preaches to the sixth church
[1:12:05] age and he has an interval he stops and
[1:12:08] preaches what 10 virgins and the hundred
[1:12:16] and forty four thousand I thought that's
[1:12:19] when they were called right now not
[1:12:21] between the six seven church age but the
[1:12:23] Secret Service seal they're called out
[1:12:24] now but but he stopped preached ten
[1:12:26] virgins then the next night he preached
[1:12:28] this one not this one not in this one
[1:12:29] not now what do you do with the sixth
[1:12:32] seal come down preach one two three four
[1:12:34] five six had questions and answers then
[1:12:38] that night he preached the Seventh Seal
[1:12:39] there was an interval and right in this
[1:12:41] interval let me tell you something about
[1:12:42] in this interval right here he found out
[1:12:45] a lot of things he found out then people
[1:12:49] wasn't getting what he's doing about
[1:12:54] you're not getting it it's not for you
[1:12:57] go on as you are live a good simple
[1:12:59] Christian life it's already gone from
[1:13:03] you that's why there was a brother
[1:13:05] called me and dad was talking about it
[1:13:07] that's why on this seventh seal remember
[1:13:10] and I'm not saying this with no
[1:13:12] disrespect to brother Branham but he
[1:13:14] really was trying to fill out something
[1:13:16] remember he preached the seventh sealing
[1:13:18] and he went back and retyped it the next
[1:13:20] day somebody all know that he preached
[1:13:23] the seventh with senior book he preached
[1:13:25] the seventh seal preached the whole
[1:13:27] entire thing then you look down at the
[1:13:29] bottom and they put this little thing in
[1:13:31] says brother Branham the next day had
[1:13:33] the brothers come back into a motel room
[1:13:36] right brother leg you know you remember
[1:13:37] that and come back into the motel room
[1:13:40] and he reap reached a section of the
[1:13:42] Seventh Seal he wasn't satisfied with it
[1:13:44] or he wasn't to reap reached it again
[1:13:47] amen why but I'll tell you why because
[1:13:49] he got off frustrated because nobody was
[1:13:53] paying attention to it
[1:13:55] he was a human but how can you not be a
[1:14:01] human and think that none of the
[1:14:04] congregation of six seven eight hundred
[1:14:06] people sitting in front of him was
[1:14:07] getting anything he said the whole week
[1:14:09] even in the sixth seal he said I was
[1:14:12] hoping and waiting for someone to stand
[1:14:14] up and say I see it and they haven't
[1:14:17] done it why because when he come to
[1:14:20] questions and answers he said oh I want
[1:14:21] his questions on the seals all he got
[1:14:24] was should women wear pants to bed
[1:14:26] pajamas two or three times about the
[1:14:29] Trinity two or three times about water
[1:14:31] baptism should we do this and are you
[1:14:33] gonna have a healing service there was
[1:14:34] only about two questions of the whole
[1:14:37] thing about the seals and they weren't
[1:14:39] anything very deep so he knew then when
[1:14:42] he come to them questions he read them
[1:14:44] that night he read them that night he'd
[1:14:46] come in that next morning then we sit he
[1:14:48] stood there he said he's going from you
[1:14:50] and you know what I do I believe that
[1:14:52] angel told him that because how could
[1:14:55] brother Branham say how could brother
[1:14:58] Branham say it's gone from you it's not
[1:15:01] for you unless he had a revelation that
[1:15:04] it wasn't for them so he preached the
[1:15:08] seventh so he preached the seals and and
[1:15:10] nobody got it you and I are gonna get it
[1:15:14] cuz you and I have the right crystal we
[1:15:17] have the right receptor to get it we've
[1:15:21] had fifty five years of honing this
[1:15:24] thing down to where we can get it but in
[1:15:28] that we're in that interval my folks my
[1:15:30] brother's my sisters we're in an
[1:15:31] interval we're in a gap or a space what
[1:15:36] we've never been before we've never been
[1:15:38] this close to the coming of the Lord
[1:15:40] never been this close to a revelation of
[1:15:43] the seventh seal and what it is they
[1:15:45] just not let my people they made the
[1:15:48] seventh seal polygamy amen they've made
[1:15:53] it seven thunders they made it two Lords
[1:15:56] they made it two souls they made it
[1:15:59] everything in the world except Christ in
[1:16:01] you the hope of glory the simplest
[1:16:04] revelation you'll ever get will be have
[1:16:08] a foundation of a city
[1:16:09] seals that we've been preaching for over
[1:16:10] a year on now tried to break it down the
[1:16:13] best I know how to break it down even
[1:16:15] more than brother Dale not higher than
[1:16:17] him no way but broke it down a little
[1:16:20] bit longer more than sixty two sermons
[1:16:22] that's for sure but tried to break it
[1:16:25] down so that now that we've come to this
[1:16:26] place and Joshua's getting ready to take
[1:16:29] us over the Holy Ghost is getting ready
[1:16:30] to say hey we've been around this
[1:16:32] mountain long enough it's time to what
[1:16:36] go on and do what we said we're gonna do
[1:16:38] everybody everybody get in one place
[1:16:41] Joshua get in one place put the ark what
[1:16:45] what he just would do Joshua did exactly
[1:16:48] exactly what he should have done he put
[1:16:50] the word first he put the word first
[1:16:53] then he said stand back about a thousand
[1:16:56] meters because you've never been this
[1:16:57] way before but as they walk you keep
[1:17:00] walking with them and then now you've
[1:17:03] been that way before and then when you
[1:17:05] get into the Promised Land it's not such
[1:17:08] a strange thing because you and I when
[1:17:10] you got the new Burke you've got part of
[1:17:11] the Promised Land but remember when
[1:17:13] Joshua puts them in the Promised Land
[1:17:15] they didn't just lay back get in the
[1:17:17] hammock and start eating grapes they
[1:17:19] fought for every inch of ground but they
[1:17:23] won all them Heights
[1:17:25] they fought every ight and they got
[1:17:29] their position you and I gotta fight for
[1:17:33] every position we got to fight every
[1:17:35] itthere is Jeb besides have us here
[1:17:42] times and websites
[1:17:53] Lula's and that's right and brando mites
[1:17:56] we got to fight all that because it's
[1:17:59] Christ in you the hope of glory here
[1:18:02] won't be any other way it won't be a
[1:18:04] famous preacher gonna stand up and tell
[1:18:06] you something you've never heard before
[1:18:08] no now you say well yeah you've said
[1:18:11] some things I've never heard before well
[1:18:12] you know what if you disbelieve them you
[1:18:16] better start praying if you believe them
[1:18:18] they've already they've laid dormant in
[1:18:20] there you've read them sister Julie
[1:18:23] she's not here tonight but she told me
[1:18:24] she said there's no telling how many
[1:18:26] times I've read that sermons where he
[1:18:27] talks about to omnipotence cuz ones in
[1:18:30] the Patmos vision we've read the church
[1:18:31] age book 500 times
[1:18:33] okay 400 but we read the church age book
[1:18:36] all of our life how many times did you
[1:18:38] read that where brother Browne said in
[1:18:40] the pomace vision when to omnipotence
[1:18:42] meet but what it is listen how many
[1:18:45] times we read the Bible and you go today
[1:18:48] out of chapter really how many times you
[1:18:52] read the Bible and go I just read that
[1:18:53] last week or not how many times you had
[1:18:55] a preacher come up and read your quote
[1:18:56] or read your script you go I just read
[1:18:59] that last week you know what there's a
[1:19:01] time and a place for everything to be
[1:19:03] revealed it's not gonna be revealed all
[1:19:06] at one time God's not going dumping on
[1:19:08] us because we can't take it but he's
[1:19:10] gonna give you a little bit and you know
[1:19:11] what he's gonna hold that for a little
[1:19:13] while so that you'll get this part
[1:19:15] around it and then he's gonna open it up
[1:19:18] and you're gonna take that and you're
[1:19:21] gonna keep eating it in because John ate
[1:19:22] the whole book he didn't leave two or
[1:19:24] three pages out he ate the whole book he
[1:19:26] ate it like that old brother said from
[1:19:28] cover to cover let's stand our feet god
[1:19:34] bless you we're in an interval and it's
[1:19:37] not an interval but we're sitting around
[1:19:38] not doing nothing no gods won't list the
[1:19:41] cross over and I believe we put the word
[1:19:45] first
[1:19:47] I believe we put the word first and even
[1:19:53] in that interval because the word goes
[1:19:56] remember God's always in motion God's
[1:20:00] always moving and the people that got
[1:20:02] left behind us the people that quit
[1:20:04] moving musicians come on the people that
[1:20:08] quit moving listen Luther had a message
[1:20:10] Wesley had a message the Baptist had a
[1:20:13] message that's reading this other day
[1:20:14] but what happened was they cabbage down
[1:20:16] in other words stopped if you don't know
[1:20:19] that southern word cabbage down they
[1:20:21] stopped and said this is it
[1:20:23] and then God said no it's not come come
[1:20:27] come come follow me
[1:20:28] mm-hm cuz that's what would have
[1:20:31] happened if you take the Ark of the
[1:20:32] Covenant with the priests here stands
[1:20:34] Joshua top of the Holy Ghost he's their
[1:20:36] leader and he said okay follow that arc
[1:20:39] and a couple of and a couple of tribes
[1:20:43] go I think we're gonna go this way
[1:20:46] see that's what we've been you were not
[1:20:49] following the word with that well that
[1:20:51] looks better cuz it looks more shallow
[1:20:53] over that way
[1:20:54] oh I said shallow didn't it that looks
[1:20:59] like it I didn't mean that really didn't
[1:21:01] that shallow over there let's go over
[1:21:04] there cuz it's easy we don't have to
[1:21:05] think so much no I think I remember one
[1:21:10] time when the Bible number when the guy
[1:21:12] walked out in the water to his knees
[1:21:13] then he got to his loins then he got to
[1:21:17] his chest and then it was water to swim
[1:21:20] in that's the water I want to be cuz you
[1:21:23] know what God's not gonna let you drown
[1:21:25] I promise you that amen you love the
[1:21:27] Lord but we're in that interval we're in
[1:21:29] that gap or that space of time that
[1:21:32] we're right at the verge of the seventh
[1:21:35] seal becoming open to it and not just
[1:21:37] preaching the seventh seal but it's kind
[1:21:39] of come open to you a personal something
[1:21:41] a personal revelation every seal first
[1:21:44] seal second seal third fourth fifth and
[1:21:46] six should be a like we were talking

[1:25:28] Easter weekend he didn't just get out of
[1:25:33] the tomb he got a opportune for me and
[1:25:36] you so that we don't have to go into one
[1:25:39] when we get a true revelation we will
[1:25:42] not go into the tenth and then because
[1:25:45] he's made that provision already for us
[1:25:47] he's already been through all that he's
[1:25:49] he's the high priest that's been touched
[1:25:51] by the feeling of our infirmities
[1:25:52] well my infirmity is a grave that's the
[1:25:56] big infirmity you know you can say I
[1:25:58] feel bad but hey you're most of us all
[1:26:01] of us are heading toward the grave we're
[1:26:02] born to die until what until we come to
[1:26:06] place we've never been before not a new
[1:26:09] thought or some new doctrine or some new
[1:26:11] idea don't get that in your head it's
[1:26:13] not that it's something we've already
[1:26:15] just like I read when to omnipotence
[1:26:17] meet how many times that we read that in
[1:26:20] the message and just read right over the
[1:26:22] top of it but he's talking about two
[1:26:25] all-powerful beings meet together listen
[1:26:28] before the fall when God got together
[1:26:31] with Adam
[1:26:33] talk about all-powerful tell me what
[1:26:36] Adam couldn't do except create but now
[1:26:40] listen once we have the baptism of the
[1:26:42] Holy Ghost once we come to the great
[1:26:45] third Pole
[1:26:48] let there be
[1:26:50] let there be let there be we had a
[1:26:54] little profit in the end time he'd give
[1:26:56] us some training he trained us you show
[1:27:01] that was just for brother branham
[1:27:02] disagree
[1:27:04] he didn't leave and take everything with
[1:27:06] him he left and give us everything that
[1:27:10] we needed to get us out of here and it's
[1:27:13] right here it lies in these books and
[1:27:15] tapes what brother Branham said we just
[1:27:16] got to get in them dig them out and then
[1:27:19] not bring our own revelation but bring a
[1:27:22] true revelation from God and that'll
[1:27:24] change our body it won't be something
[1:27:26] you gotta scrub you update fifteen
[1:27:28] showers you got to change and put
[1:27:29] something no it's all gonna come from
[1:27:31] inside it's what you pack in God's gonna
[1:27:34] quicken what you packed in that's what
[1:27:37] he'll do listen God can't quicken
[1:27:38] something you don't have inside but he
[1:27:41] will quicken what you've held inside of
[1:27:44] you so you got to here remember faith
[1:27:46] doesn't come by preaching they doesn't
[1:27:48] come by speaking faith comes by hearing
[1:27:50] but somebody's got to speak and you hear
[1:27:54] I told them the other day I told y'all I
[1:27:56] somebody told me that the Bible said
[1:28:00] this in a different way but I came up
[1:28:02] with the phrase that that it is a heart
[1:28:05] it's hard to learn with your mouth open
[1:28:10] and I told brother rush that and he said
[1:28:13] that's somewhere in the Bible and he
[1:28:14] looked it up and he said biddings act
[1:28:16] like that but it's somewhere somewhere
[1:28:17] in the Old Testament he they talked
[1:28:19] about that but yeah it's hard to learn
[1:28:20] with your mouth open
[1:28:22] two ears one mouth somebody's got to be
[1:28:25] the one in my somebody got to be the one
[1:28:27] who stands up here because you know what
[1:28:29] that's what the Bible said the Bible
[1:28:32] said for the perfecting of me and you we
[1:28:36] need a fivefold ministry and I believe
[1:28:38] we've got a good one take care this
[1:28:41] weekend there's gonna be a lot of
[1:28:44] traffic on the road you may be traveling
[1:28:48] we're gonna be traveling but if you're
[1:28:50] here this is your church home you come
[1:28:54] here expecting a resurrection on Sunday
[1:28:59] we'll be back Monday lord willing and
[1:29:02] just keep us in your prayers
[1:29:03] so all minds clear let's bow our heads
[1:29:05] Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for
[1:29:07] this time period that we have just to
[1:29:11] bring a few things Lord for your people
[1:29:14] that they may as John did chew on this
[1:29:17] and digest it and let it become part of
[1:29:19] them father we're standing truly at an
[1:29:22] interval we're standing at a place we've
[1:29:24] never been before and we pray Lord that
[1:29:29] we'll meet the challenge
[1:29:32] you've give us the equipment you give us
[1:29:35] the whole armour of God you sent a
[1:29:38] little prophet to give us 1,100 sermons
[1:29:40] that come straight from you and Lord I
[1:29:44] believe now it's been distributed out to
[1:29:46] a fivefold ministry and they're bringing
[1:29:48] it to the people and if we can bring it
[1:29:51] Lord clear and unadulterated Lord they
[1:29:54] will be a body change it will happen
[1:29:57] because it's already been spoken
[1:29:59] probably just be with us take care of us
[1:30:01] on the highways on the way home be with
[1:30:03] each one father until we meet again
[1:30:05] name of Jesus Christ we pray these
[1:30:07] things remember brother dick tomorrow
