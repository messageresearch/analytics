[13:26] you love the lord amen
[13:27] amen i'm not going to take too much time
[13:30] uh
[13:31] with preliminaries i want to go ahead
[13:33] directly to the word because i have a
[13:35] lot of content here
[13:36] and now when we go over this content it
[13:40] might seem like it may seem
[13:42] like seem like it's a lot and of course
[13:45] it
[13:45] it takes a while to get all this
[13:47] together and
[13:48] it probably doesn't even do it any any
[13:51] uh what's the word
[13:52] service or favor you know justice uh
[13:55] because it's
[13:56] it's a very expansive topic and it's
[13:58] just hard to cover
[14:00] this in just one wednesday night you
[14:02] know
[14:03] but we'll just do see how the lord leads
[14:05] us but uh
[14:06] i know brother wade he's been bringing
[14:08] out lately he's been bringing out about
[14:09] the dimensions
[14:10] and uh we he's been talking about hell
[14:14] of several several years maybe about a
[14:16] year and a half or two ago i was uh
[14:19] i was talking to a co-worker about about
[14:21] hell
[14:22] and how if in the nominal world is so
[14:25] uh it's so foreign to them to think that
[14:27] hell is not eternal
[14:30] and so but to us you know especially
[14:33] those who grew up in the message we have
[14:35] always heard that and
[14:36] but yet sometimes we can't even explain
[14:38] it we he we hear hell is
[14:40] is it is not eternal but we don't know
[14:42] where to find it in the scripture don't
[14:44] know where to find it in the in the
[14:46] message
[14:47] so uh i got i got to search and and i
[14:49] got to looking in the word
[14:51] and uh just the different i mean it just
[14:53] all ties in together so beautifully
[14:56] and so hopefully by the by the help of
[14:58] the lord tonight maybe the lord will
[15:00] help you see something tonight that you
[15:01] haven't seen
[15:02] before and how it how it ties in with
[15:06] eternal life i mean this is this all
[15:08] involves eternal life
[15:09] again the topic is why hell is not
[15:12] eternal
[15:13] it's a it's a topic that in in the
[15:15] nominal world you know they believe that
[15:17] it is
[15:19] and they strongly believe that
[15:20] especially trinitarian people
[15:22] when i was in the nominal world i
[15:24] thought that there was a eternal hell
[15:27] but let's see what the prophet says and
[15:28] the word says about this okay
[15:30] so let's just bow our heads and you pray
[15:32] for me amen
[15:33] our heavenly father we come before you
[15:35] lord jesus once again thanking you for
[15:37] your word
[15:37] thank you father for the opportunity to
[15:40] roll back the pages of your word lord
[15:42] god we know that you are the author of
[15:43] your word lord and you wrote the word
[15:46] father
[15:46] and you know father god that we need
[15:48] revelation in order to understand fully
[15:51] father god
[15:52] the treasures that are found therein
[15:54] lord so i pray lord jesus that you just
[15:57] reveal it to us father god and help us
[15:59] father god to receive something that
[16:01] would help us lord jesus in our
[16:02] christian walk
[16:04] be with brother ray father tonight lord
[16:06] god continue to strengthen him and
[16:08] touch his body lord jesus oh come down
[16:10] father god and
[16:11] just minister to him where he's at
[16:13] father and and just comfort sister kathy
[16:16] and the family as well during this time
[16:17] lord
[16:18] and in the days ahead father god all the
[16:21] other ones lord
[16:22] that that satan father god is just on a
[16:24] rampage father
[16:25] uh sister sister cleta and all the
[16:28] different ones lord we still continue to
[16:30] pray for them and just
[16:32] be with them lord and and just continue
[16:34] to strengthen their bodies
[16:36] father we just commit ourselves this
[16:38] time into your hands now
[16:39] we ask you these things in jesus
[16:41] christ's name amen
[16:43] amen praise the lord and the brothers
[16:46] they have that
[16:47] little power point so we're just going
[16:49] to do a teaching tonight
[16:51] and so you just bear with us amen
[16:54] praise the lord matthew chapter 25 jesus
[16:57] says and
[16:58] then shall the king say unto them on his
[17:00] right hand
[17:01] come ye blessed of my father inherit the
[17:04] kingdom prepared for you from the
[17:06] foundation of the world i want you to
[17:08] take notice that when jesus is speaking
[17:10] here he's talking about at the time of
[17:12] the white throne judgment
[17:14] he's not he this is the time when when
[17:16] when
[17:17] you're either going to get in by works
[17:19] or or good works or not
[17:21] that's right that's if you don't get
[17:24] eternal life here
[17:25] on this side this is the only chance
[17:27] that you have
[17:29] and you're either going to get in by
[17:30] good works or if there's no good works
[17:33] you're
[17:33] just not going to get in so this is what
[17:36] jesus is
[17:36] talking about here verse 35 for i was in
[17:39] hunger then you gave me meat
[17:41] i was thirsty and you gave me drink i
[17:43] was a stranger and you took me in
[17:46] naked and you clothed me i was sick and
[17:48] you visited me
[17:49] i was in prison and you came unto me
[17:52] then shall the righteous answer him
[17:54] saying lord
[17:55] when saw we thee and hungered and fed
[17:57] thee or thirsty and gave thee drink
[17:59] when saw we thee a stranger and took the
[18:02] end or naked and clothed thee
[18:04] or when shall we be sick or in prison
[18:07] and came unto thee and the king shall
[18:09] answer and say unto them verily i say
[18:11] unto you
[18:12] in as much as you have done it unto the
[18:14] unto
[18:15] one of the least of these my brethren
[18:17] you have done it unto me
[18:19] amen then shall he say unto them on the
[18:22] left hand depart from me
[18:24] ye cursed into everlasting fire
[18:27] prepared for the devil and his angels
[18:30] for i was in hunger then you gave me not
[18:33] meat i was thirsty
[18:34] and you gave me no drink i was a
[18:37] stranger and you took
[18:38] me not in naked and ye clothed me not
[18:42] sick and in prison and ye visited me not
[18:45] then shall they also answer him saying
[18:48] lord
[18:48] when saul we thee and hungered or a
[18:51] thirst or a stranger
[18:53] naked or sick or imprisoned did not
[18:55] minister unto thee
[18:56] notice how both parties called him lord
[18:59] because in that day every knee shall bow
[19:01] and every
[19:02] tongue will confess that jesus christ is
[19:04] lord amen
[19:05] then shall he answer them saying verily
[19:08] i say unto you and as much as ye did it
[19:10] not
[19:11] to one of the least of these ye did it
[19:13] not to me
[19:15] and these shall go away into everlasting
[19:17] punishment
[19:18] but the righteous look at the
[19:19] differentiation here but the righteous
[19:22] into life eternal amen amen praise the
[19:25] lord jesus so
[19:26] you may be seated amen
[19:32] praise god
[19:35] amen so so in looking at this topic um
[19:39] uh the next slide brothers uh you can
[19:42] see that uh
[19:43] i i took a screenshot here of of of a
[19:46] search i did on google
[19:48] and this this is just some of the books
[19:51] that that are out there on this topic
[19:54] apparently
[19:55] it is very it's a very popular topic
[19:57] people are interested in
[19:58] in hell people are interested in if is
[20:01] it real
[20:02] is it not real amen for you and me
[20:06] if if it's in the word it's real
[20:10] but for the secular world out there and
[20:12] for the nominal world out there who kind
[20:14] of does the psychological thing you know
[20:16] uh they have to you know write the books
[20:20] and
[20:20] kind of try to explain things and who
[20:22] knows some of it might be for money
[20:24] as well but it's a it's a topic that
[20:27] people are interested in amen
[20:29] uh it's among christians and
[20:31] non-christians now next slide
[20:34] hell is also known in the bible as
[20:37] as hades go ahead and click brother
[20:40] hades which is the greek
[20:42] word for for hell it is is
[20:45] is the word hades and uh and then also
[20:48] it's known in the bible that shell
[20:50] or shell next next just click again
[20:54] shall and it that is the hebrew word for
[20:56] for
[20:57] for for hell as well so it's mentioned
[21:00] in the bible in these three in these
[21:02] three forms
[21:03] amen now the next slide
[21:06] we're going to go go through through
[21:08] here quickly because
[21:09] it's got some things here go to you know
[21:11] another
[21:12] this is the meaning of of hell another
[21:15] world in which the dead continue to
[21:16] exist the nether realm of the devil and
[21:18] the demons
[21:19] which condemn people's up for
[21:20] everlasting punishment
[21:22] this is what the world believes you see
[21:25] uh
[21:25] a place or state of misery torment or
[21:29] wickedness
[21:30] amen a place or state of turmoil or
[21:33] destruction
[21:34] now personally and just get just get
[21:36] down to the point personally i believe
[21:38] hell is a place now brother wade he's
[21:41] been talking about this
[21:42] but it is a it is a dimension it's the
[21:44] realm of the lost
[21:45] amen and to and to me the way i see
[21:49] according to the to when you read the
[21:51] message
[21:52] it's almost as if a person is like it's
[21:54] a continuing
[21:55] falling and you can't ever get away from
[21:58] that
[21:59] in other words uh it's almost like for
[22:02] example
[22:02] maybe whatever the the thing that you
[22:05] dreaded the most in life
[22:06] is probably what's coming on you 24 7.
[22:10] non-stop let's just say sometimes kids
[22:12] are scared of these little cartoons and
[22:14] these little things that
[22:15] you know nowadays uh you know
[22:18] zoe sometimes and bella show me some
[22:20] some what is it
[22:22] a horn head or
[22:25] i i don't remember anyways but imagine
[22:28] some some lanky thing that's got two two
[22:30] big old sirens siren head and things
[22:33] like that
[22:33] just imagine that uh uh 24 7.
[22:37] nonstop just coming at you that's how
[22:40] that's
[22:41] i would think that i would say that's
[22:42] hell yeah man
[22:44] it's not necessarily see you know the
[22:46] devil you know with a pitchfork you know
[22:48] hitting you and you know in the back you
[22:50] know anything like that it's not
[22:51] anything like that that's just what's
[22:52] that's what the hollywood has presented
[22:55] and it's what they made us think as we
[22:56] grew up you see
[22:58] but hell is a place of torment and it's
[23:00] a constant
[23:02] i don't know who would want to be in a
[23:04] position like that i mean you put
[23:05] yourself in a place
[23:06] for example if you're having a nightmare
[23:09] and that just might be
[23:10] that just might be a few minutes
[23:13] imagine that nightmare consistently
[23:18] non-stop that's that's
[23:21] that's hell amen next slide
[23:27] now hades this is what hades means is
[23:29] the greek
[23:30] god of the underworld the underground
[23:32] abode of the dead
[23:33] in greek mythology and this is a this is
[23:36] a
[23:36] supposedly hades hades is always
[23:39] pictured with three
[23:41] as a three-headed beast of some sort
[23:44] now what do you think that they got the
[23:46] uh uh the the pitchfork idea
[23:50] that's where they got it from and
[23:53] sometimes they paint hades which is a
[23:55] greek god
[23:56] with three forks on the on the pitchfork
[23:58] or or it's just two so
[24:00] next slide and then shale which is the
[24:03] uh
[24:04] the the hebrew way of of looking at hell
[24:07] is the abode of the dead
[24:09] in the early hebrew thought so that's
[24:12] that's the definition of that
[24:13] next slide all right i put this in
[24:17] because i thought this was interesting
[24:18] did you know that in greek mythology
[24:20] hades
[24:21] is both the land of the dead and the god
[24:23] who rules there
[24:25] hades the god who the greeks also called
[24:28] pluto
[24:29] is the brother of zeus and poseidon
[24:33] this is zeus who ruled the skies
[24:36] and the seas zeus in greek in greek
[24:39] mythology he's like the
[24:40] he's like the the the he's god i mean
[24:43] that's god
[24:44] now where do you think that we increa in
[24:47] the earth when the early christians in
[24:48] catholicism they adopted christianity
[24:51] they got it when these things
[24:53] right they got it from greek mythology
[24:55] and roman
[24:56] roman uh uh beliefs and things
[24:59] like that so but it's interesting that
[25:01] in the greek mythology
[25:03] hades and zeus were brothers
[25:06] now satan in the bible it was the
[25:08] closest thing to
[25:09] to to god remember what i believe is in
[25:13] ezekiel that it talks about uh
[25:15] uh he says he he was beautiful made
[25:18] perfect in
[25:18] every way i mean every he was decorated
[25:21] beautifully so
[25:22] satan is not an ugly uh being he's not
[25:26] somebody with a pitchfork he is he's a
[25:28] beaut he's an angel of light he can
[25:30] transform himself as an angel of light
[25:32] that's why he's so deceiving amen
[25:35] he's the closest thing and so when he
[25:37] was talking to eve
[25:38] when he was talking to eve and telling
[25:40] her hey
[25:42] surely you will not surely die i mean
[25:45] because you know if you eat thereof you
[25:48] know you become as gods knowing right
[25:50] and evil
[25:51] not an eve not realizing that they were
[25:54] already gods
[25:56] amen and he was telling her that they'll
[25:58] become as gods
[26:00] you see so uh he's very deceptive but
[26:03] it's very interesting that in greek
[26:05] mythology that's what that was the
[26:06] belief as well so
[26:08] next slide see everything has a
[26:11] i always tell i always tell uh uh people
[26:14] everything
[26:15] has a root you know you watch a movie
[26:17] it's like brother trevor was talking the
[26:19] other day you know you watch a movie or
[26:21] you
[26:21] you listen to a song or you do something
[26:23] like that it has a root
[26:25] somebody got some something that idea
[26:29] has come from somewhere
[26:31] and it wasn't just something that just
[26:32] come it has a root from from somewhere
[26:34] so these ideas come from group
[26:37] a poll i'm just going through these real
[26:39] quick so that you can understand
[26:41] the the the the what people think of
[26:44] hell
[26:44] in in the time they were living in in
[26:46] 2014 they did a poll
[26:48] to christian or a lot of people in
[26:50] america about if they believed in hell
[26:52] 58 believed in hell in two 59
[26:56] believed in hell in 2007 in 2014 58
[27:00] believed in hell it went down and then
[27:02] down here in the air in the graves the
[27:04] ones who don't believe 30 percent in
[27:07] 2007
[27:08] it went up to 34 in in 2014.
[27:11] and i'm sure it's higher now amen next
[27:14] slide
[27:15] uh this is the the belief of hell
[27:18] amongst religious groups um
[27:20] if you want this information you can
[27:22] come to me i'll be more than glad to
[27:24] give it to you
[27:25] i used to be a jehovah's witness so i
[27:27] know this is true
[27:29] seven percent of them only believe in
[27:31] hell because they
[27:32] they don't really they don't believe in
[27:35] hell they believe that when you die
[27:37] that's it you are completely annihilated
[27:40] you're completely destroyed
[27:42] and uh because they believe that the
[27:44] ones remaining are there 144 000 there
[27:47] will be here left
[27:48] on earth so um evangelical protestants
[27:52] 82
[27:53] believe in hell 11 don't believe
[27:56] and they're supposed to be evangelical
[27:58] protestants
[28:00] the one supposed to believe the in the
[28:02] bible but yet there's people amongst the
[28:04] same christians that don't even believe
[28:05] in hell
[28:06] that read the same bible that you and i
[28:08] do that talks about it
[28:10] but yet don't believe in it uh uh
[28:13] historically black protestants
[28:15] there's 12 percent of them that don't
[28:17] even believe believe in hell so
[28:20] this is very interesting next slide
[28:24] now this is the generational cohort by
[28:26] belief in hell
[28:28] this is for example younger millennials
[28:31] who don't believe in hell
[28:33] is 16 the ones that believe is 13
[28:37] um older millennials uh
[28:41] 16 don't believe the ones that do
[28:43] believe 14
[28:45] but now watch generation x generation x
[28:48] on our
[28:48] next slide i'm going to show a chart of
[28:50] what these generations are
[28:52] generation x is the generation that's
[28:54] rein raised right now at this very
[28:56] moment
[28:56] for example my daughter bella uh zoe
[29:00] my daughters they're considered
[29:01] generation x
[29:03] 27 do not believe in hell this was in
[29:06] 2014
[29:08] and i'm sure it's higher now so the
[29:10] belief in it it can
[29:12] con is constantly going lower and lower
[29:15] um even baby boomers are starting to
[29:18] to to doubt now
[29:22] saying it's just satan he's on a rampage
[29:25] right now amen
[29:26] next slide and so real quick
[29:29] the the ones that were born between 1928
[29:32] to 1945
[29:33] are are called the silent generations
[29:36] that would be you brother dale
[29:40] sister clito sister sister peggy hey man
[29:44] uh the ones born between 1946 1964 would
[29:48] be the baby boomers
[29:50] that would be you brother wade amen
[29:53] 1980 uh that's me we're considered
[29:57] generation
[29:57] x that's between 1965 to 1980.
[30:01] i was born in 1980 that's generation x
[30:05] this should be ages 39 to 54 millennials
[30:08] are born between 1981 to 1996.
[30:13] and then of course from 1997 to 2012 is
[30:16] generation
[30:17] z generation z so so that
[30:20] would be our younger children that's
[30:22] generation z
[30:24] which in the previous slide if you want
[30:25] to go back to that to that slide
[30:28] uh it's generation well it's generation
[30:31] x right here that would be that that's
[30:33] actually that's actually my generation
[30:35] so next slide
[30:38] next slide so if generation x is is not
[30:41] even uh
[30:42] uh believing in hell i can imagine you
[30:44] know generation z
[30:45] that's growing up right now that's what
[30:48] we got to pray for our children
[30:51] give keep them in the word saints do
[30:53] everything you can for them amen don't
[30:55] just let them just
[30:56] let them just just free roam and let the
[30:59] internet take care of them you you're
[31:01] supposed to take care of them amen
[31:03] you're supposed to put luck you know
[31:05] controls in what they watch and what
[31:07] they see and
[31:08] because it's it's going to it's going to
[31:10] uh indoctrinate them
[31:12] right you see and eventually they'll
[31:14] come out and
[31:15] they'll say hey i don't believe this
[31:17] anymore i don't you know
[31:20] don't be surprised if you didn't do your
[31:22] part right
[31:23] don't that's i'm just being wrong with
[31:25] you you know i
[31:27] i ca and you might have done your part
[31:30] but again it boils down to a thing that
[31:33] it has to be between them and god
[31:35] amen it's a it's a it's a relationship
[31:38] between them and god
[31:40] now let's go to the uh nitty gritty
[31:43] let's define the word uh eternal amen so
[31:47] the next slide
[31:50] and in the strong's concordance is the
[31:52] word ionos
[31:53] and that is uh means perpetual eternal
[31:57] forever lasting
[31:58] uh for everlasting uh next slide
[32:03] and this is from thayer's dictionary it
[32:05] means without beginning and end
[32:07] that which always been and always will
[32:09] be amen
[32:10] praise god we we all know that amen if
[32:13] you have god's
[32:14] life in you which is his eternal life if
[32:16] you have god's spirit
[32:18] dwelling in you amen by the new birth
[32:20] amen you have god's own life in you
[32:22] that means your soul amen didn't ever
[32:24] have again it never has an end amen
[32:26] because his spirit's dwelling in you
[32:28] amen uh without beginning amen without
[32:31] end
[32:32] never to cease now it says
[32:36] everlasting and in these definitions
[32:39] they used
[32:40] everlasting back and forth back and
[32:42] forth
[32:43] and that's how the bible uses it back
[32:45] and forth so you have to
[32:47] read it and know what it's talking about
[32:49] we're going to read some quotes here
[32:50] but the brother branham says something
[32:52] really good in the church age book
[32:54] about this uh next slide
[32:58] now let's read matthew 25 41 uh we just
[33:01] read it then shall he say unto them on
[33:02] the left hand depart from me ye cursed
[33:05] into everlasting fire prepared for the
[33:07] devil
[33:08] and his angels i want you to understand
[33:11] that's
[33:11] how the hell and in this case this is
[33:15] the lake of fire
[33:16] because this is after this is during the
[33:18] the white throne judgment
[33:20] all that was not prepared for you and i
[33:22] nope
[33:24] it was not prepared for humans it was
[33:25] not prepared for animals it was not it
[33:27] was prepared for satan
[33:29] and his angels and because it was
[33:31] prepared
[33:32] that means it has a beginning
[33:35] and if it has a beginning that means
[33:38] it's got to have an
[33:39] end right the only thing that doesn't
[33:42] have a beginning
[33:43] is god's eternal life or god himself
[33:47] amen and it doesn't have an end either
[33:50] because whatever doesn't have a
[33:52] beginning doesn't have an end
[33:53] whatever started has to end
[33:57] amen that's why i always say problems
[34:00] we go i'll go through problems but
[34:03] problems are not eternal
[34:04] thank god for that they have
[34:08] they have a beginning that means they
[34:11] got to have an
[34:11] end now it could be maybe 10 years down
[34:14] the road
[34:15] i don't could be a three seconds it
[34:17] could be
[34:18] 10 minutes i don't know but if it's a
[34:20] problem here on this life
[34:22] it's gonna have an end amen praise god
[34:25] so
[34:26] brother ray right now there's a problem
[34:27] going on
[34:29] he's he's he's got eternal life amen
[34:31] there's no there's no issue amen
[34:34] if the lord decides if it's time to his
[34:36] time to go amen he's better off than we
[34:38] are amen
[34:39] but it has an ending it has an ending
[34:42] every problem has an ending so let's not
[34:44] worry let's say
[34:45] lord oh you know yes it's tough it's
[34:48] hard we all go through problems
[34:50] right but y'all always keep in mind it's
[34:51] always helped me this has an
[34:53] end this has an end this this hasn't
[34:55] been
[34:56] amen so this so the the lake of fire was
[35:00] not prepared for you and me is prepared
[35:01] for satan and his angels
[35:03] matthew 25 46 and these shall go away
[35:05] into everlasting punishment
[35:07] but the righteous into life eternal amen
[35:10] now notice how jesus
[35:11] is making this a distinction between the
[35:13] ones that go into
[35:15] everlasting punishment and the ones
[35:18] who have received life eternal amen see
[35:22] if they were to if the ones that were to
[35:24] go to life
[35:25] to everlasting punishment why didn't
[35:27] jesus use the same wording
[35:30] if they were to be there for eternity
[35:33] just like the righteous they're supposed
[35:34] to be you see he didn't use
[35:36] life eternal he could have said and they
[35:38] shall go into life eternal in life
[35:41] eternal punishment but he didn't say
[35:43] that he said the everlasting punishment
[35:46] but the righteous into life eternal
[35:49] he makes a distinction between two
[35:51] things so it's not the same thing now
[35:54] we're going to look at the word
[35:55] everlasting here in just a moment uh
[35:56] next so in verse 41
[36:00] hell or in this case also the lake of
[36:02] fire
[36:03] was not prepared for man but for the
[36:05] devil and his angels
[36:07] next
[36:10] i think it's a nut some more that comes
[36:12] up yes in verse
[36:14] you like you like this animation
[36:17] in verse 46 jesus makes a clear
[36:19] distinction between the outcome of the
[36:21] unrighteous
[36:22] and the righteous you see there's
[36:24] there's a distinction there
[36:26] next just hit it again
[36:31] all right and the same greek word was
[36:33] used
[36:34] in that in that verse there has to be a
[36:36] clear distinction between both parties
[36:38] regarding their life
[36:40] listen to this otherwise both parties
[36:42] would end up with eternal life
[36:44] and the same reward this doesn't make
[36:48] sense
[36:49] doesn't make sense you you believe in
[36:51] eternal hell because you were told there
[36:53] was an eternal
[36:54] head but when you start looking digging
[36:56] down in the word amen
[36:57] you realize wait a second they can't be
[37:00] this way
[37:00] next next slide now this is the word
[37:03] everlasting amen the definition of the
[37:05] word everlasting lasting watch
[37:07] lasting or enduring through all time it
[37:10] could be
[37:11] because the word uses the bible uses
[37:13] interchangeably
[37:15] but you have to know what it's talking
[37:16] about because in the order of events of
[37:18] things
[37:19] you see continuing now watch
[37:22] continuing for a long time or
[37:26] indefinitely you see so it it
[37:29] it could be it could be for a long time
[37:32] the lake of fire
[37:33] is there for a long time but eventually
[37:36] the bible says that it's going to be
[37:37] destroyed
[37:38] it's going to be swallowed up you see
[37:40] amen
[37:42] um tediously persistent so and the
[37:44] oxford dictionary when you read that it
[37:46] says
[37:46] lasting forever or a very long time
[37:50] so it gives a space of time it doesn't
[37:53] say
[37:54] doesn't say just eternal amen
[37:57] there's a space of time amen again you
[38:00] have to go back to verse 46 that we just
[38:02] read in matthew 25
[38:04] jesus clearly made a distinction between
[38:06] the ones that were the lost
[38:08] and the ones that received eternal life
[38:10] you see and they go to two different
[38:12] places
[38:13] if they have the same eternal life why
[38:14] not go to the same
[38:17] you place so next slide
[38:21] let's see what the prophet says and the
[38:23] message why am i why i'm against
[38:24] organized religion and there
[38:26] you excuse me for all the yellow and all
[38:28] that but you know hopefully it's getting
[38:29] your attention
[38:32] and there's no scripture that says there
[38:34] is an eternal hell
[38:37] because eternal never did begin neither
[38:39] does it ever
[38:40] end so the bible said hell was created
[38:43] for the devil and his angels so it it's
[38:46] it isn't
[38:47] eternal there was a time when it wasn't
[38:50] and there will be a time when it's not
[38:52] again
[38:54] but they may be punished in their
[38:56] through fire and brimstone
[38:58] and the pits of fire for eons of time
[39:01] all right but it finally will end
[39:04] because hell is not
[39:05] eternal hell is not
[39:08] hell it itself or it can't be eternal
[39:12] you see eternity belongs to a person
[39:14] amen
[39:16] eternity is a person man that's right
[39:19] therefore uh
[39:20] it can't be inside of a place you know
[39:23] and make that thing eternal
[39:25] you see it has to eternity has to dwell
[39:27] in you amen
[39:28] has to dwell in a person next
[39:32] brother branham continues here and if
[39:34] there was an eternal hell
[39:36] you'd have to have eternal life to live
[39:38] in an eternal hell
[39:41] and if it was eternal it always was
[39:44] and you always was in hell and you'll
[39:47] always be in hell
[39:48] now what brother branham is talking
[39:50] about there is
[39:51] those of you who have eternal life for
[39:54] example if you have eternal life and if
[39:56] hell was eternal
[39:57] then you'd always be part of that of
[39:59] hell right right
[40:01] but remember hell was created for satan
[40:04] and his angels
[40:05] it has a beginning god doesn't have a
[40:08] beginning
[40:09] amen are we are we understanding amen
[40:12] just kind of breaking down what the
[40:13] prophet's saying amen
[40:14] see there is no such a thing it doesn't
[40:17] make any sense
[40:18] but when you tell people this i mean
[40:21] it's just like they just don't get it
[40:22] and you you really come to a point where
[40:24] you really like
[40:24] lord if it's not a revelation people
[40:27] won't understand it exactly i mean you
[40:29] can just give them all the data and you
[40:30] can give them bullet points and you can
[40:32] just
[40:32] like explain to them but if it doesn't
[40:34] become alive in people's
[40:36] in people's life it'll just it'll just
[40:39] be like i don't get it
[40:40] i don't get it and they feel like
[40:42] they're being deceived and that you're
[40:43] in a cult
[40:45] i've had the same co-worker co-worker
[40:47] think that i'm i'm in a cult
[40:48] he's like man everything you're telling
[40:50] me just sounds like a cult
[40:52] what can you say there
[40:56] so you see eternal is never had a
[40:59] beginning or an
[41:00] end and there's only one form of eternal
[41:02] life and that is in god
[41:05] all right comes from the greek word zoe
[41:08] which means
[41:08] god's own life and when we are born
[41:12] again of the spirit of god we become
[41:14] eternal with god
[41:15] amen because we have part of his life
[41:19] which makes us sons and daughters to god
[41:22] then we have eternal life again brother
[41:25] branham
[41:27] states then we have eternal life we
[41:29] don't come here with
[41:30] eternal life amen we
[41:33] have to come to eternal life here in
[41:35] this life
[41:36] amen you have to make a choice
[41:39] that's why god gave us a free moral
[41:42] agency amen
[41:43] you see the ones that go to hell or the
[41:45] ones that died the loss
[41:47] they made their choice here their choice
[41:49] was not to serve god the gospel probably
[41:51] was presented to them and they rejected
[41:53] it
[41:54] at some point in time maybe even hitler
[41:57] came to that point
[41:58] i know hitler was involved a lot of
[42:00] things with the catholic church and
[42:01] things like that maybe at some point in
[42:03] time
[42:04] it was presented to him and maybe he
[42:06] didn't flat out reject it
[42:08] but in the in his actions he rejected it
[42:11] and that's what caused his fall maybe
[42:15] some of us we don't flat out say no i
[42:17] don't i don't i don't want the word
[42:18] i don't want to serve god i don't want
[42:20] to you may not say it but your actions
[42:22] display it
[42:24] and it'll show your choice as to where
[42:26] you're heading after this life
[42:28] right because we're all going to be
[42:30] heading somewhere
[42:32] you're somewhere and eventually
[42:37] once you get to that point you're going
[42:38] to have to depend on the white throne
[42:39] judgment then to get you in
[42:41] if you were good to mom and dad or if
[42:43] you were good to an uncle or some
[42:45] neighbor or something like that there
[42:46] was a that was part of the bride
[42:50] i don't want to get in on that i want to
[42:52] know for
[42:53] for sure now that i have the goods
[42:56] i don't want to wait until i get to the
[42:58] train station amen and and not have the
[43:00] ticket ready to go
[43:02] amen get the ticket now amen get ready
[43:05] now while
[43:06] the time is still while we're still in
[43:08] this time
[43:09] amen next
[43:13] amen brother brown continues saying
[43:14] here's questions and answers
[43:16] see the difference the wicked has
[43:18] everlasting punishment
[43:20] in other words it has it has an end to
[43:22] that
[43:23] but everlasting is a space of time now
[43:26] if it would have been the same it would
[43:28] have been written and these shall go
[43:30] away into everlasting punishment
[43:32] the other shall go away into everlasting
[43:34] life see or they shall go away
[43:37] into eternal punishment and the other
[43:39] one into eternal life
[43:41] talking about like the verse that we
[43:42] were just reading in matthew chapter 25
[43:44] verse 46
[43:45] see if there's an eternal punishment to
[43:47] be punished forever and ever
[43:50] then there's an eternal he's got eternal
[43:52] life
[43:53] the sinner has eternal life just like
[43:55] you
[43:57] next and the only one eternal life and
[44:00] that comes from god
[44:03] look everything without a beginning has
[44:05] no end
[44:07] everything with the beginning has an end
[44:10] see what i mean amen so
[44:14] just explaining to what we were talking
[44:15] about amen so
[44:17] you should be the happiest people on
[44:18] earth amen with with eternal life in
[44:22] your soul
[44:23] and that eternal life has got to be true
[44:25] it's got to translate
[44:27] into into eternal life for your body a
[44:29] redemption for your body
[44:31] going to manifest on the outside we're
[44:33] heading towards that
[44:34] at this very moment amen i believe that
[44:37] with all my heart
[44:38] and it'll come to its culmination amen
[44:41] john
[44:42] john chapter 10 verse 28 says and i this
[44:45] is jesus speaking and i give unto them
[44:47] eternal life and they shall never perish
[44:51] so who is the source of eternal life
[44:53] jesus christ who is god
[44:54] amen neither shall any man pluck them
[44:57] out of my hand
[44:58] amen once you're sealed in the kingdom
[45:00] of god there's nobody
[45:01] satan can't even take you out
[45:05] satan will try his best but he can never
[45:07] pluck you out of his
[45:08] out of his hand amen praise the lord
[45:10] next slide
[45:13] now john uh chapter 12 verse 25
[45:16] again we're going through a lot of
[45:17] reading but just be patient with me amen
[45:20] and i'm just kind of trying to keep
[45:21] things in in order you know
[45:24] he that loveth his life shall lose it
[45:26] and he that hateth his life
[45:28] in this world in other words in this
[45:30] life that you're living in
[45:32] shall keep it unto life eternal amen
[45:36] i preached the message amen uh i think i
[45:39] titled it amen
[45:41] i want to be a loser do you yeah but
[45:43] this is somewhere this is what i want to
[45:44] lose i want to lose my life
[45:46] so that i can gain his amen lose
[45:50] everything that i am amen that's carnal
[45:52] everything that that
[45:53] that comes against the word of god that
[45:55] i may gain him amen
[45:57] it's what paul said romans chapter 6
[46:00] verse 23 says for the wages of sin
[46:02] is death in other words let's just read
[46:06] it like this for the wages of
[46:07] unbelief is death because that's what
[46:10] sin is is unbelief
[46:12] in other words that's your reward it's
[46:14] death
[46:16] for the wages of sin is death but the
[46:18] gift of god
[46:19] is eternal life amen
[46:22] the gift of god when you believe his
[46:24] word amen take it in and lord that's for
[46:26] me
[46:27] i accept it amen eternal life praise god
[46:31] watch through jesus christ our lord in
[46:34] the baptist church we quote this all the
[46:35] time
[46:37] but you know now brother dale has become
[46:38] more real to me
[46:42] when you understand the man about
[46:43] eternal life and in your soul and
[46:46] and and everything it just it's a good
[46:49] verse to kind of get people saved
[46:51] yeah right you see and they tell you
[46:53] this you know and you and
[46:54] it is it's it it's a good but then when
[46:57] you really read it and look at it and
[46:58] say lord thank god but the gift of god
[47:01] is eternal life
[47:02] through jesus christ our lord and lord
[47:04] who who who have we believed in amen
[47:07] amen it's in our lord jesus christ amen
[47:09] next
[47:12] all right so these last verses that we
[47:14] were just reading tie with this verse
[47:15] now we're going down to revelations
[47:17] chapter
[47:18] 20 and the sea gave up verse 13 and the
[47:22] sea
[47:22] we're talking about the first death and
[47:23] second death now
[47:25] and the sea gave up the dead which were
[47:27] in it
[47:29] and death and hell delivered up the dead
[47:33] which were in them and they were judged
[47:35] every man
[47:36] according to their works this is what's
[47:38] going to happen just
[47:39] right before the the the white throne
[47:42] judgment
[47:43] amen verse 14 and death and hell were
[47:46] cast into the lake of fire
[47:48] this is the second death amen after the
[47:52] judgment amen death and hell were cast
[47:54] into the lake of fire
[47:57] now so the lake of fire has to be
[48:00] something separate from hell
[48:02] it can't be hell but you see in the
[48:05] nominal world it's used interchangeably
[48:08] and people get confused they think that
[48:10] the lake of fire is hell and that hell
[48:12] is the lake of fire it's two
[48:14] is two different things hell is thrown
[48:17] into the lake of fire
[48:19] so is death hell and death is thrown
[48:22] into the lake of fire and not only that
[48:24] the unbeliever who didn't make it
[48:25] through the white throne judgment
[48:27] is also thrown in there not only that
[48:29] satan is also throwing their
[48:31] false prophet and all these different
[48:33] ones they're going to be thrown in there
[48:34] to what to be completely annihilated
[48:37] and whosoever was not found watching
[48:40] whosoever was not found written in the
[48:42] book of life
[48:43] was cast into the lake of fire
[48:47] now i would rather you know it's
[48:51] if i was a sinner you know an unbeliever
[48:53] i'd rather i'd rather have eternal life
[48:55] burning in hell but
[48:57] to be completely annihilated
[49:00] to exist no more that's actually worse
[49:03] that's worse than to be burning you know
[49:06] forever
[49:07] but you have eternal life
[49:10] doesn't make any sense there has to be a
[49:13] complete annihilation sure
[49:15] the fact that that hitler died and god
[49:18] be the judge
[49:19] but but but let's say hitler might be in
[49:21] a constant hell right now
[49:24] judas for example the bible says that he
[49:26] was the son of perdition
[49:28] in other words the son that was to be
[49:30] lost he's right now in a constant hell
[49:33] right now
[49:34] it could be right now that that that
[49:36] what he did
[49:37] the betrayal is constantly just being
[49:39] displayed in front of him
[49:41] and it's just a constant that's that's a
[49:43] hell
[49:44] right that's a torment but that torment
[49:47] has to cease
[49:48] because they will be thrown into the
[49:49] lake of fire if they don't get
[49:51] if they don't make it through the white
[49:52] throne judgment so
[49:54] is that that i hope that that's amen
[49:58] next slide
[50:00] all right so next i think we have some
[50:03] things all right so
[50:04] the first death it is go ahead
[50:07] it is the death that you die after your
[50:09] life leaves this earth
[50:11] now the bible doesn't mention first
[50:13] death but every time he talks about this
[50:15] death it just mentions death
[50:17] so it is the first death whenever we
[50:19] pass away from this life it is
[50:21] it is death it's the first death next
[50:27] go ahead brother the second death
[50:32] it is death that takes place in the lake
[50:34] of fire which is
[50:35] it's is not hell so we just established
[50:38] because hell is thrown into the lake of
[50:40] fire
[50:41] amen next slide
[50:45] are you still with me amen appreciate
[50:47] you all are listening so nicely
[50:49] i don't see anybody sleeping yet that's
[50:51] awesome it's great
[50:54] [Laughter]
[50:55] let me do more animations
[50:59] amen so the second death this second
[51:01] death is complete annihilation because
[51:03] death and hell go into this lake of fire
[51:07] as well
[51:08] complete annihilation now we're going to
[51:10] look at something here because all souls
[51:12] belong to god
[51:13] amen this is where death first death
[51:16] hell and all unrighteous will be
[51:19] completely destroyed
[51:20] never to ever exist again that's a
[51:22] scarier thought than any than even
[51:24] eternal hell
[51:25] amen to never see to cease to exist
[51:29] to never not even be in the mind of god
[51:32] you know in the mind of god not even to
[51:33] be in the in the mind of anybody
[51:36] ever again satan's coming to that point
[51:40] amen praise god
[51:43] next but he just wants to take
[51:47] everybody he can with him he knows these
[51:50] scriptures are there talking about him
[51:52] whether he believes him or not i mean i
[51:54] believe he does but he's
[51:56] he knows he's sealed to death
[52:00] hebrews 12 28 29 wherefore we receiving
[52:02] a kingdom which cannot be moved let us
[52:04] have grace whereby we may serve god
[52:06] acceptably with reverence and godly fear
[52:09] receiving a kingdom that is the uh holy
[52:12] spirit amen that's god's eternal life
[52:14] for our god is a consuming fire
[52:18] so as they say the buck stops with god
[52:22] everything amen he is the creator he did
[52:26] create amen
[52:27] and correct me if i'm wrong brother dale
[52:29] but he did create
[52:30] the lake of fire he did create these
[52:32] these places amen
[52:34] they but they're not eternal amen
[52:37] they're they're the stopping place for
[52:39] for the unrighteous and the stopping
[52:41] place for hell
[52:42] death and satan amen next
[52:46] because god is a just god he's got to
[52:50] punish
[52:50] evil amen he's got he's got to
[52:52] completely do away with unbelief
[52:55] amen ezekiel 18 4 be watch what
[52:58] god says here behold all souls are mine
[53:02] that includes the the even the sinner
[53:04] out there
[53:07] not just the christian even the sinner
[53:09] out there those souls belong to god
[53:12] amen and there's something i put here in
[53:15] just a moment
[53:15] uh that you'll see those souls they
[53:18] belong to god
[53:20] but don't necessarily mean that they're
[53:21] part of god
[53:24] you see what i'm saying the souls all
[53:27] souls belong to god let me say it again
[53:28] but don't
[53:29] necessarily are part of god amen
[53:33] once you receive eternal life in your
[53:35] soul you're part of that god you're part
[53:37] of the eternal life amen
[53:40] as the soul of the father so also the
[53:42] soul of the son is mine
[53:43] the soul that sinneth watch it shall
[53:47] die not that it it may die or it may be
[53:50] no it shall die so enough let's read it
[53:54] like this
[53:55] the soul that unbelieves the word
[53:58] it shall die amen
[54:03] and what is die to completely annihilate
[54:06] that's what that word die in the in in
[54:08] that verse means to completely in other
[54:10] words
[54:11] to completely be eradicated to be to not
[54:14] exist anymore
[54:16] matthew 10 28 and fear not them which
[54:18] killed the body this is jesus speaking
[54:20] and fear not them which kill the body
[54:21] but are not able to kill the soul
[54:25] in other words jesus saying don't fear
[54:27] man amen but fear
[54:29] god fear him which is able to destroy
[54:32] both soul and body in hell
[54:35] amen and when you look that word destroy
[54:39] right here because you could you could
[54:40] think you know that that's where
[54:42] everything ends remember
[54:43] hell is thrown into the lake of fire but
[54:46] when you look at this word destroy right
[54:48] here
[54:48] it means to render useless mar
[54:51] separation
[54:52] so in hell you're completely separated
[54:56] amen in a constant torment in a constant
[54:59] torment
[54:59] amen amen so don't fear man
[55:02] don't fear what's going on right now
[55:04] fear god amen a lot of people fearing
[55:07] why everything is going on
[55:08] here on the outside and maybe the things
[55:10] that we experience on the outside
[55:12] and then we neglect our our spiritual
[55:14] our spiritual life
[55:16] we neglect praying we neglect reading
[55:18] amen i i i do it
[55:20] amen we neglect the things that will
[55:22] take us amen
[55:24] to a closer walk with him amen next
[55:31] all right so so if now watch this so if
[55:34] god is a consuming fire and all souls
[55:36] are his
[55:37] that means that he can do whatever he
[55:39] wants with man's souls
[55:41] right you get that
[55:45] they're all his he can do whatever he
[55:47] wants to do there are souls that will
[55:49] utterly and completely be destroyed by
[55:51] this lake of fire
[55:53] who he is the source of amen
[55:56] which god is the source of this is
[55:58] because of the choice that
[55:59] those souls made here on earth we have
[56:02] all have free moral agency
[56:04] we all choose if we want to serve god or
[56:06] we want to
[56:07] or we want to reject god amen amen
[56:11] all souls belong to god but all souls
[56:13] are not part of god
[56:15] what makes you part of god is the but
[56:17] his belief in his word amen you're
[56:19] receiving
[56:20] jesus christ amen receiving that word
[56:23] amen in your life
[56:25] and your soul next
[56:32] so if those souls hell and death are all
[56:35] eternal
[56:37] then that means god lives in hell and in
[56:40] death
[56:41] and in those souls that are to be
[56:43] destroyed
[56:45] we know he doesn't
[56:49] if either eternal that means god is part
[56:51] of death
[56:52] god is part of hell god is part of all
[56:54] these things
[56:55] but it doesn't make any sense all right
[56:58] we know this
[56:59] is not the case because light who god is
[57:01] the source of and darkness
[57:03] cannot dwell together amen and we know
[57:05] that light is god's own life
[57:08] amen god's own life next amen
[57:12] i believe uh this is second corinthians
[57:14] chapter six
[57:15] light and darkness cannot coexist be ye
[57:18] not unequally yoked together with
[57:20] unbelievers let me just stop here for
[57:21] just a moment and let me say something
[57:25] this is why the bible talks about not
[57:28] being unequally yoked together with
[57:30] unbelievers
[57:32] because their destination the
[57:34] destination of the unbeliever
[57:36] is death complete annihilation
[57:40] so why would a christian amen want to be
[57:44] yoked with somebody who doesn't even
[57:46] believe
[57:47] in life they don't even understand life
[57:51] maybe they've rejected life
[57:54] verbally by their actions maybe they
[57:57] just don't know
[57:59] but when they're not saved they're not
[58:01] born again why would you want to partake
[58:03] in that
[58:03] right that means that you are part of
[58:07] that death
[58:09] that dark you're a part of that darkness
[58:12] because light and darkness cannot
[58:14] coexist
[58:17] i i cannot when i was when i became a
[58:19] christian
[58:21] i could not continue with the friends
[58:23] that i used to have
[58:25] brother wade i'm sure the same you say
[58:27] the same thing with you you can continue
[58:29] with your drinking buddies
[58:31] i can continue with the people because
[58:33] we are not compatible anymore
[58:36] they talk about death i mean they're not
[58:38] talking about death
[58:39] but i mean that's that's what's coming
[58:41] out of their life that's what they're
[58:42] expressing
[58:44] but here i am i'm trying to express life
[58:47] and it's incompatible that's why a
[58:49] christian and a non-christian who are
[58:51] like
[58:51] boyfriend and girlfriend going out that
[58:54] means they're both of the same
[58:56] they believe the same thing if you're
[58:58] get going along with the with the person
[59:01] and and just hanging out and you just
[59:03] you you
[59:04] nothing bothers you amen that means
[59:06] you're part of the same mold
[59:08] i'm sorry to say but that's the truth
[59:11] now somebody might say well you know
[59:13] they finally will eventually come you
[59:15] know and become christians you don't
[59:17] know that
[59:18] right why would you want to play with
[59:19] something that's not even sure
[59:22] i want to play with something sure amen
[59:24] i want to play with with with light amen
[59:27] that that's that's that's eternal that's
[59:29] sure amen
[59:30] but why would i want to mess with
[59:32] something that's unsecure
[59:34] why would you want to go inside a
[59:35] vehicle maybe i'm talking to our young
[59:38] people why do you want to go inside a
[59:39] vehicle
[59:40] that you know amen the tires are kind of
[59:42] half loose
[59:43] you know and take a a a trip to uh
[59:48] alabama and and like you know
[59:51] you know that that car something's gonna
[59:54] happen
[59:55] but yet you still get in it we still get
[59:58] in it as adults
[59:59] we still get into situations that are
[1:00:02] rocky and unsecured but yet we still
[1:00:04] encourage
[1:00:05] encourage it we still fall into it
[1:00:09] got to be careful that's why the bible
[1:00:11] clearly says be not
[1:00:12] unequally yo together with unbelievers
[1:00:16] those that are heading to a certain
[1:00:18] destination
[1:00:19] but sometimes we just encourage it and
[1:00:22] we just
[1:00:22] we just and then we wonder why is my son
[1:00:25] or my daughter
[1:00:26] going the same route
[1:00:31] for what fellowship hath righteousness
[1:00:33] with unrighteousness
[1:00:35] what fellowship there's no righteous
[1:00:37] there's no i can't
[1:00:39] there's nothing for me to discuss with a
[1:00:40] with an unbelieving girl
[1:00:43] that i and i'm trying to be a servant a
[1:00:46] god
[1:00:46] as a christian with an unbelieving girl
[1:00:48] it doesn't i don't know what's
[1:00:50] what compatibility is there and what
[1:00:52] communion
[1:00:53] what communion hath light with darkness
[1:00:58] all right i am not saying this is the
[1:01:00] bible telling you this
[1:01:02] you get mad with the word if it hurts i
[1:01:05] hope it does
[1:01:06] and what concord hath christ with belial
[1:01:09] belial was a god that they used to
[1:01:11] worship back again
[1:01:13] or what part hath he that believeth with
[1:01:15] an infidel
[1:01:17] it doesn't make any sense that's why
[1:01:20] when you see for example you thought
[1:01:21] this is a christian going out with such
[1:01:23] and such in person
[1:01:25] you question it because it doesn't make
[1:01:28] any sense
[1:01:29] that means they're just somebody's
[1:01:31] pulling somebody else
[1:01:33] and most of the time it's the
[1:01:34] non-christian pulling the
[1:01:36] so-called christian next
[1:01:41] first john chapter 3 verse 15 whosoever
[1:01:44] hateth
[1:01:45] his brother is a murderer now watch
[1:01:47] going back to
[1:01:49] who who has this eternal life and who
[1:01:51] doesn't
[1:01:52] whosoever hateth his brother is a
[1:01:54] murderer and ye know that no
[1:01:56] murderer hath eternal life that word
[1:01:59] eternal life there is zoe
[1:02:01] amen it has they don't have eternal life
[1:02:04] abiding in him
[1:02:06] a murderer doesn't have eternal life
[1:02:07] abiding in him right
[1:02:09] first john 5 11 to verse 12 and this is
[1:02:12] the record that god
[1:02:14] hath given to us eternal life zoe
[1:02:17] and this life zoe is in his son
[1:02:22] it's not in anybody else it's not in any
[1:02:24] other program it's in
[1:02:25] christ amen and his son he that hath the
[1:02:29] son
[1:02:30] hath life zoe and he that hath
[1:02:34] not the son of god hath not life
[1:02:37] it's clear as day right amen
[1:02:41] you're part of god you have eternal life
[1:02:44] you're not part of god you don't have
[1:02:45] eternal life
[1:02:46] and and what is your destination it's
[1:02:48] death
[1:02:49] amen amen praise god next
[1:02:54] brother branham says you might wonder
[1:02:56] now when you can use that word eternal
[1:02:59] and not use it the way we have been
[1:03:00] taught that is easy
[1:03:03] when it applies to god it means to be
[1:03:06] without beginning or end
[1:03:07] and ever enduring and never ceasing
[1:03:11] and when you talk of eternal life you
[1:03:14] have that in mind which is the
[1:03:16] life of god this is the record that god
[1:03:19] has given
[1:03:20] us eternal life and that life is in the
[1:03:21] sun we just now read this that verse
[1:03:24] he that hath the son hath life now then
[1:03:28] only watch only sons of god have life
[1:03:32] eternal
[1:03:33] the kind that never had a beginning but
[1:03:36] always was
[1:03:39] that means they're not destined to a
[1:03:41] hell
[1:03:42] all right they're not destined to lake
[1:03:44] of fire why because that eternal life
[1:03:46] has already conquered all that
[1:03:49] that eternal life in you has conquered
[1:03:51] all that already
[1:03:53] amen praise god glory next
[1:03:57] brother batman says here you have
[1:03:59] something in you right now that is
[1:04:01] eternal
[1:04:03] without beginning or end it is the
[1:04:06] spirit of god
[1:04:08] it is part of god himself it is the life
[1:04:10] of god
[1:04:12] amen so how can that life exist in hell
[1:04:18] now if a sinner is going to go to hell
[1:04:20] and then suffer the same as you are
[1:04:22] going to heaven
[1:04:24] and enjoy heaven then he has the same
[1:04:28] kind of life you have already
[1:04:31] amen praise god so it can't be
[1:04:34] it can't be there's does it just doesn't
[1:04:36] make any sense that it that a sinner
[1:04:39] is enjoying eternal life the same
[1:04:41] eternal life that you and i have
[1:04:43] because eternal life comes from the same
[1:04:45] source
[1:04:46] and that's god amen next
[1:04:50] all right now revelations chapter 20 i'm
[1:04:52] going to go
[1:04:53] a little quicker here revelation chapter
[1:04:55] 20 satan has to be cast into the lake of
[1:04:58] fire
[1:05:00] and the devil that deceived them was
[1:05:02] cast into the lake of fire now this is
[1:05:04] not hell
[1:05:05] this is the lake of fire this is the
[1:05:06] second death okay
[1:05:09] and brimstone where the beast and the
[1:05:11] false prophet
[1:05:12] are and shall be tormented day and night
[1:05:16] forever and ever uh
[1:05:17] not now this is where they they ask you
[1:05:19] but look what it says there it says
[1:05:22] forever
[1:05:23] day day and night forever and ever
[1:05:26] right all right well let's keep reading
[1:05:28] this is forever and ever and this verse
[1:05:30] sounds like it it's for eternity but
[1:05:34] next in the same chapter in just a few
[1:05:38] verses down
[1:05:39] you read and the sea gave up the dead
[1:05:41] which were in it
[1:05:42] this is coming this is coming into the
[1:05:44] white throne judgment
[1:05:46] in other words this is that the the the
[1:05:49] resurrection amen
[1:05:50] that this is that resurrection of the uh
[1:05:53] and they're coming to be uh
[1:05:55] judged at the white throne judgment and
[1:05:58] death and hell
[1:05:59] delivered up the dead which were in them
[1:06:02] right death and hell in other words the
[1:06:05] hell that they were in
[1:06:07] let's just say judas let's just say
[1:06:09] judas judas is in hell right now right
[1:06:12] in a constant torment now i don't
[1:06:14] believe it's a physical place
[1:06:15] i believe it's just a state a state that
[1:06:18] it's in he's in
[1:06:19] they will be delivered from that in
[1:06:21] other words they will be taken from that
[1:06:23] and be and be brought and they were and
[1:06:25] they were brought to this white throne
[1:06:27] judgment amen
[1:06:28] and they were judged every man according
[1:06:30] to their works
[1:06:33] at that point you're going to have to
[1:06:35] depend on on the works that you did
[1:06:37] in order to get eternal life
[1:06:40] again i don't want to play with
[1:06:42] something that's that's unstable
[1:06:44] i don't want to get an unstable vehicle
[1:06:46] amen i want to get in something solid i
[1:06:48] want to get something solid right now
[1:06:50] amen and death and watch in verse 14 and
[1:06:54] death and hell
[1:06:55] were cast into the lake of fire we
[1:06:57] already read this verse a while ago
[1:06:59] this is the second death now this is the
[1:07:02] that this is where also the dead
[1:07:06] will go to as well when if they don't
[1:07:08] get eternal life
[1:07:09] in the white throne judgment and
[1:07:10] whosoever was not found written in the
[1:07:12] book of life was cast
[1:07:14] into the lake of fire amen that's the
[1:07:17] second death
[1:07:18] they had their first death they were
[1:07:20] they had their first death they went to
[1:07:22] hell
[1:07:23] now they've been now they're judged at
[1:07:25] the white throne judgment
[1:07:26] and if there don't make it there they're
[1:07:28] going to be annihilated completely
[1:07:31] that's the order of things amen
[1:07:35] aren't you glad that god is in your life
[1:07:36] amen amen
[1:07:38] the the believer is not destined to be
[1:07:42] at the white throne judgment
[1:07:44] to be judged they will be judging
[1:07:48] but not to be judged you and i are going
[1:07:51] to be part of that judging because watch
[1:07:53] the bible says in one place it says
[1:07:55] don't you know that you and i will be
[1:07:57] judging uh angels
[1:07:58] that's right amen and some of these
[1:08:01] cases that that for example
[1:08:03] you changed some some unbeliever
[1:08:06] might have helped changed your tire
[1:08:08] while you were
[1:08:10] a sister that didn't you know was not
[1:08:12] able to help herself as
[1:08:13] her tower went flat and an unbeliever
[1:08:15] came in they gave you that
[1:08:17] cup of water they helped you as a bride
[1:08:21] member
[1:08:22] you will be part in that judge you will
[1:08:24] be part of that
[1:08:25] to help give eternal life to that person
[1:08:28] and they didn't even know it
[1:08:31] they didn't even know next
[1:08:36] now let's compare revelations chapter 20
[1:08:38] verse 10 to this verse
[1:08:41] um revelations 22
[1:08:44] 5 and there shall be no night there and
[1:08:47] they need
[1:08:48] no candle neither light of the sun the
[1:08:51] lord god giveth them light
[1:08:52] and they shall reign forever and ever
[1:08:55] now
[1:08:56] in in the previous in the brother
[1:08:58] brother anderson or brother bob can you
[1:09:00] go back to
[1:09:01] two slides next previous
[1:09:05] you see where it talks about satan
[1:09:07] thrown the devil the seed thrown to the
[1:09:08] lake of fire
[1:09:10] tormented day and night forever and ever
[1:09:13] that same forever and ever is the same
[1:09:14] forever and ever and the verse that we
[1:09:16] just read
[1:09:19] amen let's just let's just look at
[1:09:21] something here just a moment
[1:09:22] next next amen they shall reign
[1:09:26] forever and ever amen next
[1:09:32] all right the phrase forever and ever
[1:09:36] next the phrase ever and ever sounds
[1:09:40] like it could just mean
[1:09:41] eternity and even in the greek it
[1:09:43] denotes that
[1:09:45] when you read it in the greek but it
[1:09:47] also means a space of time
[1:09:50] and see below this is the
[1:09:53] this is the actual word aeon
[1:09:56] and it's forever an unbroken age
[1:09:59] perpetuity of time eternity the world's
[1:10:03] universe or a period of time or
[1:10:06] age so so
[1:10:10] those are the two same that same word
[1:10:12] that same phrase
[1:10:13] is the same word in those two is those
[1:10:15] two verses in other words
[1:10:17] in chapter 20 verse 10 there's a period
[1:10:19] of time for satan
[1:10:21] to be in that lake of fire or in that
[1:10:23] amen
[1:10:24] that's where actually that's where he's
[1:10:25] completely destroyed amen
[1:10:28] this same phrase is used in both
[1:10:30] revelations 2010 and revelations
[1:10:32] 2013-15 that we just read
[1:10:35] amen next
[1:10:39] all right so what random says here
[1:10:43] in questions and answers now to get the
[1:10:45] word forever
[1:10:47] look at the look at the aeon did you
[1:10:49] notice here in the bible how many has
[1:10:51] ever heard it said
[1:10:52] and aeons and aeons and how many knows
[1:10:55] that aeon is a space of time
[1:10:57] why sure anybody knows that aeon is the
[1:10:59] space of time
[1:11:01] and they shall burn for aeons that
[1:11:03] spaces of time
[1:11:05] cast into the lake of fire and shall
[1:11:06] burn for aeons aeons means the spaces
[1:11:09] of time they may burn for a hundred
[1:11:12] million years in punishment but finally
[1:11:14] they have to come to an
[1:11:15] end to be extinct altogether
[1:11:18] you see so uh
[1:11:22] they they could burn in that lake of
[1:11:24] fire for
[1:11:25] for for aeons but they're not going to
[1:11:27] be burnt for eternity
[1:11:29] aeons and eternity is two separate
[1:11:31] things amen
[1:11:32] remember eternity comes from god amen
[1:11:35] see because
[1:11:36] everything that is not perfect is the
[1:11:38] perverted
[1:11:39] off of the off of the perfect and it had
[1:11:42] a beginning so it must have an
[1:11:44] end next
[1:11:48] but we who believe on the lord jesus
[1:11:50] christ has zoe
[1:11:52] god's own life in us and have eternal
[1:11:56] life
[1:11:57] not have life forever and ever the
[1:12:00] sinner has life forever and ever
[1:12:02] but we have eternal life amen
[1:12:06] so you see the difference between
[1:12:07] forever and ever
[1:12:09] and the eternal life is two different
[1:12:11] two different things
[1:12:15] get here where where he's at so that i
[1:12:17] make sure i'm
[1:12:20] all right
[1:12:23] okay so satan will also have his time in
[1:12:26] hell
[1:12:27] before being cast into the lake of fire
[1:12:30] in revelations chapter 20 verse
[1:12:32] 2 to 3 and he laid hold on the dragon
[1:12:35] the lord
[1:12:37] that old serpent which is the devil and
[1:12:39] satan bound him a thousand years
[1:12:41] this is during the millennial reign that
[1:12:43] we're to be here on earth
[1:12:45] satan will be bound in other words he
[1:12:47] will be in his hell
[1:12:49] he will be in his perpetual torment just
[1:12:52] like he's
[1:12:52] you know he has helped others be in that
[1:12:54] perpetual torment you know
[1:12:56] he'll be in his perpetual torment you
[1:12:58] know or in his in his torment
[1:13:01] but it's go it's got it's got a time
[1:13:02] limit it's going to expire in thousand
[1:13:05] years
[1:13:06] and cast him into the bottomless pit now
[1:13:09] it's interesting to use his bottomless
[1:13:11] pit because that's what hell is
[1:13:13] it's a it's a constant feeling that
[1:13:15] you're i mean you're just falling and
[1:13:18] there's no end can you imagine that amen
[1:13:21] who's ever had a dream that you're
[1:13:23] falling and and that you just there's no
[1:13:26] ending there's no stopping to that it's
[1:13:28] terrible
[1:13:29] i've never had it but i heard it i heard
[1:13:31] it's bad it's terrible right
[1:13:34] but that's what hell is it's a
[1:13:37] bottomless pit
[1:13:38] and shut him up shut satan up and set a
[1:13:42] seal upon him that he should deceive the
[1:13:44] nations no more
[1:13:45] so during that time there will be no
[1:13:47] effect from satan amen
[1:13:49] oh you will see no effects from satan
[1:13:51] the way the earth was supposed to be
[1:13:53] before sin came into place that's how
[1:13:55] the earth will be during that time
[1:13:57] amen the nation he will deceive the
[1:14:00] nations no more till the thousand years
[1:14:02] should be fulfilled
[1:14:04] and after that he must be loosed a
[1:14:06] little seasoned
[1:14:08] amen so that's another topic for another
[1:14:10] day next
[1:14:12] all right how many has learned something
[1:14:15] amen
[1:14:17] amen
[1:14:17] [Applause]
[1:14:21] all right in summary i was when i was
[1:14:24] put in this slide right here i was i was
[1:14:25] like
[1:14:26] should i put a picture of hell there
[1:14:29] like no i'd rather put a picture of life
[1:14:32] put a picture of eternal life it means
[1:14:34] usually when you
[1:14:35] when you see uh you know the topic of
[1:14:38] hell
[1:14:38] you know and they they make it really
[1:14:40] interesting like smokey and
[1:14:42] and hell and a big old cave and satan
[1:14:44] horns and all kind of to try to bring
[1:14:46] the attention well
[1:14:47] oh this should bring the attention of
[1:14:49] the believer amen
[1:14:51] in summary god is the only source of
[1:14:53] eternal life
[1:14:55] all right that means there's no
[1:14:57] beginning and no end and that eternal
[1:14:59] life should be in you and me as
[1:15:00] believers right
[1:15:02] next there is no way
[1:15:05] that death hell and sinners will live
[1:15:08] eternally
[1:15:09] being punished it doesn't
[1:15:12] it doesn't make any sense because that
[1:15:15] means that they have to have the same
[1:15:17] eternal life that you have
[1:15:20] and god doesn't work that way and it
[1:15:23] doesn't it doesn't agree with the word
[1:15:26] amen death hell
[1:15:29] and sinners have a beginning therefore
[1:15:32] they have to have an
[1:15:33] end god who is eternal life
[1:15:37] never had a beginning and never will
[1:15:39] have an end right
[1:15:41] and that means that you don't have an
[1:15:43] end
[1:15:44] if god is in you amen next
[1:15:49] the sinner at this time is being is
[1:15:52] at this time is being tormented in hell
[1:15:55] right
[1:15:56] and even the future ones that will die
[1:15:57] without christ
[1:15:59] that's where they're heading to a
[1:16:01] bottomless pit
[1:16:02] right right now but that torment will
[1:16:05] have to cease
[1:16:06] according to revelations chapter 20
[1:16:08] verse 13.
[1:16:10] we just clearly read amen it that they
[1:16:13] will they will
[1:16:14] it will cease because hell is going to
[1:16:16] be thrown into the lake of fire
[1:16:18] to be to be no more next
[1:16:22] satan is heading to the same place not
[1:16:25] to be tormented day and night throughout
[1:16:27] all eternity
[1:16:28] because that means brother branham said
[1:16:30] in one place that means he'd be your
[1:16:31] brother
[1:16:33] if satan is to be tormented as in hell
[1:16:35] forever
[1:16:36] with pitchforks and and and tormentary
[1:16:38] that means he has eternal life
[1:16:41] and we know satan can't have eternal
[1:16:43] life amen
[1:16:44] because that means he would be your
[1:16:46] brother we're brothers and sisters in
[1:16:49] the lord because we have we share the
[1:16:51] same eternal life
[1:16:52] we share the same father where it comes
[1:16:54] from amen
[1:16:55] that's why we're brothers and sisters
[1:16:57] but if satan is your brother
[1:17:00] i'm sorry amen amen
[1:17:04] tormented day and night and you know
[1:17:05] what saints nowadays that's what the
[1:17:07] world is playing with
[1:17:09] i don't know if you saw this latest
[1:17:11] video that came out the the other day
[1:17:13] this rap song by little nas
[1:17:15] i believe it is and and he came
[1:17:18] out uh it's it's incredible what they
[1:17:21] what they display now
[1:17:23] but he's actually having sex with the
[1:17:26] devil
[1:17:28] and uh and he this rapper he's a
[1:17:30] homosexual
[1:17:31] so you can you can keep in your mind
[1:17:33] what's going on
[1:17:34] in the video this is what happening
[1:17:36] what's happening or what they're trying
[1:17:38] to portray
[1:17:39] and so he comes out with a line of shoes
[1:17:42] of sneakers
[1:17:43] that have a nike logo on it which i
[1:17:45] believe nike didn't
[1:17:47] didn't say that they could produce those
[1:17:50] those those
[1:17:50] shoes but they apparently supposedly
[1:17:54] have
[1:17:55] some a drop of blood human blood or
[1:17:57] something like that
[1:17:59] within them or something and their their
[1:18:02] goal was to sell
[1:18:03] 666 pairs which i believe they did i
[1:18:07] don't know if they did
[1:18:08] in two minutes in two minutes they sold
[1:18:10] that
[1:18:13] this is how the world is so deceived
[1:18:16] they play with satan like it's like it's
[1:18:18] like it's nothing like it's a game like
[1:18:20] it's like it's a
[1:18:21] and uh and the world is heading towards
[1:18:23] this condition if they don't get right
[1:18:25] if god doesn't come in their life
[1:18:28] and satan is just back there laughing
[1:18:30] you know
[1:18:32] but he laughs just as much as people
[1:18:34] that disbelieve the word of god
[1:18:37] people people that con that go round and
[1:18:39] round
[1:18:40] with these doctrines and all these
[1:18:41] things like that he laughs just as
[1:18:43] even loud then he's already got the
[1:18:45] whole world he's got him bamboozled with
[1:18:47] shoes with blood on him human blood on
[1:18:49] it
[1:18:50] but the ones that supposedly believe
[1:18:52] this word and are leaving this word
[1:18:55] he's probably laughing at them even
[1:18:56] worse because he at least the demons
[1:18:59] they believe in god
[1:19:00] and tremble some of these people they
[1:19:02] they thought they believe in god and
[1:19:04] they don't even
[1:19:05] they they just throwing out their their
[1:19:07] life away amen
[1:19:10] the only thing you can do is pray for
[1:19:12] them that's that's all you can do
[1:19:14] there's nothing else you can do satan is
[1:19:17] heading to the same place not to be
[1:19:18] tormented day and night throughout all
[1:19:20] eternity but to also
[1:19:22] be annihilated for good amen amen thank
[1:19:24] god
[1:19:25] next by you having eternal life in your
[1:19:30] soul you have already conquered death
[1:19:33] hell satan and the second death
[1:19:36] none of these things can ever harm the
[1:19:38] believer amen praise god give the lord a
[1:19:40] copper praise
[1:19:42] if you're i'm thankful
[1:19:46] you have that power lying within you
[1:19:48] right now amen
[1:19:50] next and brother brown says here just to
[1:19:53] finish
[1:19:53] off i believe this is the last slide
[1:19:55] abram says here we all know that the
[1:19:57] second death is the lake of fire
[1:19:59] revelations 2014 and death and hell were
[1:20:01] cast
[1:20:02] into the lake of fire this is the second
[1:20:04] death
[1:20:05] of course that means all those who were
[1:20:07] therein were cast into the lake of fire
[1:20:10] now then i want to bring out something
[1:20:12] here for you
[1:20:13] it no doubt will cause people to comment
[1:20:16] on my strange doctrine
[1:20:19] which is not his strange doctrine the
[1:20:21] bible declares it
[1:20:23] but see that's what you have to watch
[1:20:25] brother branham was pretty much
[1:20:28] alone proclaiming this in his day
[1:20:33] all denominations believed that there
[1:20:34] was an eternal hell and that sinners
[1:20:36] were
[1:20:37] right now being burning in hell
[1:20:38] eternally roasting
[1:20:40] in an everlasting eternal roasting
[1:20:44] and brother branham preached against
[1:20:45] this because it was a doctrine from hell
[1:20:49] from the pits of hell it was from satan
[1:20:52] but watch
[1:20:52] but i stand here on the authority of the
[1:20:56] word of god
[1:20:57] and deny that the unbeliever goes to an
[1:20:59] eternal hell
[1:21:00] and burns there eternally and you know
[1:21:03] what i stand with him
[1:21:04] amen because i i don't see it any other
[1:21:06] way
[1:21:08] i don't say it any other way amen
[1:21:11] that's that's uh
[1:21:14] that is uh that's that's the last slide
[1:21:18] brother so
