[0:03] all right now let's go to whatever gun
[0:06] he 20 Bruges once-daily Hebrews 1
[0:11] Hebrews 1 we kind of got down to here so
[0:17] thank you brother Joe and Louise before
[0:22] taking over the last two Sundays I
[0:23] really appreciate that y'all get a great
[0:25] job Bob did a good job link did not last
[0:28] week so Aaron did a good job
[0:31] daddy what not that but thank you
[0:35] everybody for taking over and your
[0:36] prayers and your support because we had
[0:40] a good time over there too it was not
[0:42] playtime that's for sure we have a few
[0:45] days of rest but we did a lot of work so
[0:48] we right here before we stop we were
[0:50] talking about hmm the Sun God and son of
[0:53] man who were talking about here being
[0:55] made so much better than the angel that
[0:57] he F by inherited some obtained a more
[0:59] excellent name today so by inheritance
[1:03] he obtained a more excellent name than
[1:05] day so what name was that we know that
[1:09] was Jesus Christ I hate it right here no
[1:16] [Music]
[1:20] now the Bible says Jesus Christ the same
[1:23] yesterday today and forever which is
[1:24] exactly the truth he always was but he
[1:27] didn't develop in our part of the
[1:29] country and I think in our funny story
[1:35] just went through my head about what
[1:38] they were interpreting for me about in
[1:42] dimensions dimensions they were
[1:45] interpreting as denominations I was
[1:48] saying dimensions they were saying
[1:50] denomination Oh dimensions so that your
[1:56] there's your bank
[1:57] there's your bank huh there's one for me
[2:01] yes
[2:02] [Music]
[2:03] for me no you just give forward one for
[2:06] your family don't be on Bobby all right
[2:08] what does MVP mean yeah that's that old
[2:20] to college oh well anyway okay okay but
[2:37] we're talking about Jesus Christ because
[2:40] it says as he has by inheritance by
[2:43] inheritance he obtained a more excellent
[2:47] name Sunday night so who is this name if
[2:50] Jesus Christ we know all heaven and
[2:52] earth to hold a family his name Jesus
[2:55] Christ but now I I don't think the
[2:58] Angels are named Jesus Christ they're
[3:02] created beings for worship but they are
[3:05] not the family of God and to have a
[3:08] family you got a family name Jesus
[3:10] Christ is our family name all having a
[3:12] nurse named that Jesus Christ with the
[3:14] Angels
[3:15] but since born to which of the Angels
[3:17] said he at any time he didn't say to the
[3:19] angel for unto which of the Angels he
[3:22] that's the question that Paul was riding
[3:24] under which of the Angels did he say
[3:26] that on my son he didn't never say that
[3:28] to an angel to a lot of flying angel
[3:31] that was created now we know that
[3:33] there's angels in the Bible that are
[3:35] messengers ministers but that's not what
[3:38] that's talking about could read the
[3:39] context for under which of the angels
[3:41] and he said in any City and many times
[3:43] aren't my son this day of our garden
[3:46] they know that's not for an angel right
[3:48] angels not begotten being you and I are
[3:50] begotten by the whole bottle of baptism
[3:52] with the Holy Ghost no man we are
[3:54] begotten by the new birth angels are not
[3:57] this day have I begotten thee what's
[3:59] Paul doing Paul's establishing that
[4:01] Jesus Christ is the head of all things
[4:03] and you and I are there with him and the
[4:07] angels he's so much better than the
[4:10] Angels but now remember with the
[4:12] scripture that says being made lower
[4:14] than the ain't
[4:15] well he was he became a flesh man he
[4:18] became lower than any angel to bring us
[4:21] up amen we know that that sucks that's
[4:24] just good old boy oh it's just good ol
[4:29] evangelistic preaching talk about
[4:34] salvation and again I will be to him a
[4:37] father and he shall be to me a son he
[4:39] never looked at an angel and said you're
[4:41] my son
[4:43] he never not to an angel does he say
[4:46] then he says that to us but he said that
[4:48] to the first the first fruit good job
[4:51] good job good job because he was the
[4:55] first fruit what he was the he was the
[4:57] beginning of the creation of God he was
[4:59] the way God had to begin with that had
[5:01] they not been fall he came spoken word
[5:04] child Jesus Christ came spoken word
[5:08] child
[5:08] Christ was named Jesus when he was here
[5:12] on earth then you can say Jesus cook and
[5:16] then you here brother ground said well
[5:17] he never had another name that's he's
[5:20] actually true but you got to remember
[5:21] that name didn't develop here in this
[5:24] dimension until two thousand years ago
[5:27] when he was born because there was
[5:28] making dog so - that was me how bad I'm
[5:31] back - come brother oil was getting up
[5:33] attached from a brother hey Suz and he
[5:35] said ah Jesus is talking to me he hope
[5:38] don't were never saying that word right
[5:40] there
[5:40] hey loose till they have a Spanish
[5:42] background - so I said what Jesus
[5:45] talking to you an alien see ya Jesus is
[5:46] talking to me now so he taught me but
[5:48] people say suits hey-zeus Cristo is
[5:50] Jesus Christ there was a lot of Jesus's
[5:54] hey listen there was a lot of geodesy
[5:56] you reading the Bible there was a Judas
[5:58] not Iscariot
[5:58] right there was not a bad guy so it's
[6:02] what you're associated with anyway it's
[6:04] what makes the name bad so that's why
[6:06] the Lord Jesus Christ is we give Jesus
[6:09] all the titles that he needs the Lord
[6:12] Jesus Christ that's why we baptize and
[6:14] that family that puts us in the family
[6:17] of God not just Jesus but you can't
[6:21] baptize them Jesus only because there's
[6:23] many other jesus's but their Lord Jesus
[6:25] Christ
[6:26] right okay so he was made much more
[6:30] he made better than the Angels but
[6:34] remember he came down here became lower
[6:36] than the angel this flesh man the son of
[6:39] man but what to do bring us all back up
[6:42] because remember Jesus didn't come to
[6:45] bring us an inheritance he can't protect
[6:50] us back to our inheritance he had the
[6:52] inheritance inside of him but for him he
[6:55] had to die to make a way for us to get
[6:57] back all right
[6:58] he didn't develop down here and he was
[7:00] born Lord the Christ he was born
[7:03] Emmanuel God will see so he didn't gain
[7:06] hmm
[7:07] he ain't gaining gotcha he gained a name
[7:10] that the whole family of heaven and
[7:13] earth is named and that's the redemptive
[7:15] name of God yes see even Jehovah's not a
[7:18] name right remember one brother best and
[7:22] all them was having that argument in the
[7:23] 50s you know brother the old oak tree
[7:27] but the Bible says well what about the
[7:29] seven compound names at your home do
[7:30] they not directly affect you you know if
[7:32] you're talking about Jesus Christ and
[7:33] they have to say yes cuz any Bible
[7:35] scholar knows that that's not Jesus's
[7:37] name Jehovah is not God's name this is
[7:39] God's name okay but how clear that for
[7:43] us now that we see that to make sure
[7:45] that we know that and again I will be to
[7:48] him a father and he shall be to me a son
[7:50] see the question mark called asking
[7:52] these questions and again when he
[7:56] bringeth in the first begotten into the
[7:58] world first begotten first fruit for a
[8:03] first person first begotten into the
[8:05] world this is the first time anybody was
[8:07] born the way they should have been born
[8:09] even Adam was not born at all he was a
[8:12] created me he was created a big man you
[8:15] know 20 year old guy Jesus had to come a
[8:18] baby to be our brother so he could take
[8:21] us back all right so Paul still asked
[8:25] asking these questions because the first
[8:28] part of that says God who is sending
[8:30] time to die with matter space time past
[8:32] the prophets had in these last days
[8:34] spoken us by son who has appointed heir
[8:37] of all things by whom also he made the
[8:39] world so we know that Jesus Christ was
[8:41] the creator would know that but he
[8:43] didn't develop that name until he came
[8:47] here on earth to get all the redeemer
[8:49] Clark because that's how we and I are
[8:52] identified were identified by Lord Jesus
[8:55] Christ where I just identified by Jesus
[8:58] cuz they're from millions though but
[9:01] there's only one Lord Jesus Christ and
[9:04] now it's Christ in you the hope of glory
[9:05] that doesn't make you Jesus but I'm
[9:09] gonna read you a quote this afternoon
[9:11] where brother Branham makes it real
[9:12] close it needs to be because if not then
[9:15] you know you got a separation of people
[9:18] while we were they really caught all the
[9:21] little bits especially the ministers in
[9:23] the Philippines who were talking about
[9:25] that not being enough a second person of
[9:28] the Angels he said who made is his angel
[9:30] women and again when he brings in at
[9:32] first we got into the world he saying
[9:34] that all the angels God worship them and
[9:35] they did remember many times in the
[9:37] Bible Jesus Christ when he came out of
[9:39] his 40 day wilderness angels ministered
[9:43] to him he was provided by angels to tell
[9:46] him what was going on and that's the
[9:47] same way brother Branham was issued an
[9:50] angel whatever you want to say you but
[9:51] you were issued an angel and that angel
[9:54] sure is you know and I've already called
[9:58] everything in the world I've heard he
[9:59] called me if they ask me which I don't
[10:01] agree with that you are here at the
[10:05] often in your Angels knocked-up
[10:06] theophany that's a separate being that's
[10:09] near the help you because I'm gonna read
[10:10] it right down here are they not all
[10:12] ministering spirits sent forth to
[10:14] minister for them who shall be heirs of
[10:15] salvation who are heirs of salvation all
[10:19] the redeemed okay
[10:21] all the reading I really thought
[10:25] somebody would have said I am me I am
[10:31] I am and they were present me mystic all
[10:42] right yes
[10:43] meet me is to know what use that
[10:48] terminology and again look many brands
[10:51] have personally got into the world all
[10:53] the engines were got a worsted member
[10:54] when he remember when he was born on
[10:56] earth what happened brother Brown said
[10:58] angels went to shepherds and announced
[11:02] the birth all right of who Jesus Christ
[11:07] and again when he brings in first one in
[11:09] the world said all the engines were
[11:10] sermon and on the angels he says who
[11:13] make this his angels spirits and his
[11:15] ministers flame a fire but unto the son
[11:19] he said say because the angel didn't get
[11:22] on a throne an angel is a spiritual
[11:26] being that God created for worship
[11:30] alright alright that killed some
[11:34] Yellowjackets but anyway but into the
[11:37] son he saith thy throne O God is for
[11:39] ever and ever
[11:41] alright died thrown a scepter which is
[11:44] the staff of righteousness is the
[11:46] scepter of thy kingdom good you're
[11:48] talking about Jesus Christ know about
[11:50] honor an angel alright
[11:52] ain't you good habit from the internet
[11:54] now the one devil the devil wants a
[11:57] throne yeah alright he's an angel to it
[12:00] but I hate to create a being he he
[12:01] cannot be redeemed he's not a he's not a
[12:04] human person say it's not human he's an
[12:08] angel right now he takes on forms like
[12:11] the Beast and all of different ones but
[12:12] he can't create a being and step into it
[12:14] that's his problem when Jesus came on
[12:17] earth God created the body and he just
[12:18] you just just I mean God just stepped
[12:20] right in the body and say it was like
[12:23] what in the world went on what happened
[12:25] here I can't do that
[12:27] I can annoy people but I cannot get my
[12:30] life in them you know
[12:35] thou has loved righteousness and hated
[12:38] iniquity therefore God even thy God hath
[12:41] anointed thee with the oil of gladness
[12:43] above thy fellows are above the people I
[12:46] think what that means above the
[12:49] companions and thou Lord in the
[12:52] beginning has laid the foundation of the
[12:54] earth and the heavens are the worst now
[12:56] this is Paul expounding on who this
[12:59] person is and that award in the
[13:02] beginning has laid the foundation of the
[13:04] earth because Jesus Christ remember his
[13:07] theophylline he doesn't ever look any
[13:08] different than what it was it's like a
[13:12] you know if he's eternal that's the f4u
[13:15] if he's eternal he's not even one second
[13:18] that's why that I am is so important if
[13:22] we continue on with the I am it's not an
[13:24] I was or I'm going to be yes I am
[13:27] ever-present for eternity when he said
[13:30] let there be light this man standing in
[13:32] theophany wherever you want to say he
[13:34] was standing now in the blackness of
[13:37] whatever having the I don't know but
[13:41] when he said let there be light that's
[13:42] the same guy that's living on the face
[13:44] of the earth you're right here or he's
[13:46] or he's two different people so he's
[13:48] not-- he's not a second older because
[13:51] when this man came down he came to be
[13:53] born in sin man blood born in sin
[13:55] Shaymin in iniquity no that's us he was
[13:59] born in a way we were born in other
[14:02] words through the wound but not by not
[14:04] my say but what did he do he came here
[14:07] to get us back to so he had to give this
[14:11] life that was inside of them and what's
[14:13] that like this inside of him he said
[14:15] before Abraham was I am
[14:18] yes okay so that's do that I am in it
[14:22] was inside this person and he never
[14:24] looked that's why when this guy that's
[14:27] when this guy comes out of the tomb
[14:31] his body has changed to the theophany is
[14:34] on the inside of him and that's when he
[14:35] was a 20-year old person god never has
[14:39] been gray-headed in the old and stooped
[14:41] over he's a twenty year old man never
[14:44] has he been
[14:59] [Music]
[15:23] okay yeah there is also something so you
[15:27] need to start thinking back in this room
[15:28] get back in the room I saw you you
[15:32] far-out look when you're looking through
[15:34] that wall like you're not even here
[15:36] let's pay attention to what we're doing
[15:38] here anyway that's why we have people
[15:44] come up to three weeks later and go I
[15:45] never heard that before brother Bill
[15:47] preached on 14 times and now the word in
[15:51] the beginning that's laid the foundation
[15:53] of the earth and heavens are the works
[15:54] of thy hand now this is Paul telling
[15:56] thou Lord thou Lord are the one that
[16:00] made all this right they shall perish
[16:03] but our maintenance heaven earth pass
[16:06] away my word see you got to remember
[16:11] when says in the beginning was the word
[16:13] he was though he was the embodiment of
[16:16] the word that's like I sell them in the
[16:18] Philippines all of all of Jesus's
[16:20] ministry was only three and a half years
[16:23] but look at the thousands and millions
[16:24] of sermons this came off of that just
[16:26] three nine years that this man lived on
[16:29] earth but you got to remember though the
[16:31] Old Testament every scripture talked
[16:33] about it right entitled n even in
[16:37] reality because there's one coming
[16:38] coming off it locked him to me that's
[16:39] going to come and do this thing but when
[16:41] he comes here now what what do we do now
[16:44] this week we go well Jesus is here and
[16:45] done his work
[16:46] you know we got all his old testing but
[16:48] we gotta know they said we're the
[16:49] continuation of that you and I are the
[16:52] only body as in this dimension yes did
[16:58] you see any of that that was over in the
[17:00] influent any of them did I show any of
[17:02] that because the brother was we were
[17:04] talking about dimensions for a few
[17:06] minutes and I was saying dimensions and
[17:08] he was saying denomination they taped it
[17:14] I think but anyway the brother was that
[17:17] was interpreted he kept saying
[17:19] dimensions he kept saying I heard him
[17:22] same denomination coach denomination is
[17:23] in every language is pretty much like
[17:25] hey man it's all this everybody says
[17:26] blah blah blah denomination but then I
[17:28] looked any brother else's now that's not
[17:30] it
[17:31] so I go through about five more minutes
[17:33] of dimensions and he goes denomination
[17:36] and I go stop hold on this is not a bit
[17:38] on that this is the main dumb vain
[17:40] chance and I finally figured out a word
[17:42] that everybody can understand so but we
[17:44] have a good time with they shall perish
[17:47] but our Manton and they all shall wax
[17:50] old that done the garment Paul saying in
[17:54] the beginning that I laid the foundation
[17:56] of the earth and the heavens of the
[17:57] works of thy hand they shall perish but
[17:59] our remains because he is literally the
[18:01] body body month of the word he was the
[18:04] Word made flesh right when he was
[18:07] standing against the ice why hits the
[18:08] often ease our word theophany that's why
[18:11] when you get born again you're theophany
[18:13] it's part of that come off of that atom
[18:16] second atom yes come off that second
[18:19] atom and now your bone of his bone and
[18:21] flesh of his flesh not a saying a person
[18:24] he was not a second person from Adam she
[18:27] was the same person right so that's what
[18:30] you're not gonna see that we're not
[18:31] there's not a separation we do what
[18:33] people have done separation to us
[18:35] the denomination has divided that's what
[18:39] a division is a common denominator being
[18:42] when they shall perish and as they
[18:45] fester or what piece of cloth right
[18:49] cloak shalt thou follow them up and they
[18:54] shall be changed but thou art the same
[18:57] with the years you'll never
[18:59] Jesus Christ this night this is the same
[19:02] man later on Hebrews 13 it says Jesus
[19:05] Christ the same yesterday them for
[19:07] everything went right but to which of
[19:10] the Angels said he at any time now he's
[19:12] back to this question again he's been
[19:14] asking questions he's been expounding on
[19:16] who God is now he's asking the question
[19:18] again
[19:19] but to which of the Angels said he at
[19:21] any time sit on my right hand until I
[19:23] make thine enemies how close those he
[19:25] never felt said that to an angel he said
[19:27] back to Christ all right are they not
[19:30] all ministering spirits sent forth to
[19:33] minister for them who shall be heirs of
[19:35] salvation so there's ministering spirits
[19:38] that come to you and I to help us do our
[19:40] life yes I believe that I really do you
[19:43] see the things that happens in your life
[19:45] and you go man but then other times you
[19:49] look and you go through things and your
[19:51] life you go man where'd he go I really
[20:00] needed a moment flap on Korean air when
[20:02] I five hours and it was no air
[20:04] conditioning at all it was just a heat
[20:06] bath I was sweating in places I've never
[20:08] swept for five hours sitting in one
[20:13] place yeah you know they always tell you
[20:15] to read the little pamphlet of how to
[20:16] get out when it's and nobody ever picks
[20:19] up reason I fan for five hours with him
[20:23] so I did have a purpose I won't never
[20:27] fly Korea an area and Delta lost my
[20:32] luggage there he's got tore up when I
[20:42] got my luggage day for you they a little
[20:44] like they grow you through the airport
[20:46] on this side Oh
[20:59] nobody's gonna take me anyway it was
[21:11] there was no there was nothing up here
[21:15] they said he came to a slim in the wall
[21:18] it was a little slit right down the side
[21:21] of the wall and I was sitting in a
[21:22] window seat something came through that
[21:26] one day what get what cold I started a
[21:29] school cream girl can i crack a window
[21:36] but anyway right there for now watch
[21:42] Paul saying that look I love Paul
[21:44] watching their forward now when if you
[21:46] know that he's a scholar and he said
[21:48] therefore so what he's done is all of
[21:50] verse one he is made of summation he has
[21:53] said what he thought about this person
[21:56] here all right went through a Street for
[22:00] questions and answered them and then he
[22:04] says therefore because if you we must
[22:07] read this without that number two they
[22:09] read that in a letter that he's roped so
[22:12] he's just continuing to write the
[22:14] scholars had broke these things off into
[22:16] chapters because he says therefore so
[22:20] what's he doing he's talking about one
[22:21] hang one he broke the first ever how
[22:24] many verses was that fourteen verses
[22:26] therefore we ought to give the more
[22:29] earnest heed to the things which we have
[22:31] heard lest at any times we should let
[22:34] them slip in other words for if the word
[22:36] spoken by Angels was steadfast and every
[22:40] transgression disobedient received a
[22:42] just recompense of the reward he's
[22:44] making a statement how shall we escape
[22:46] now what's he saying now here's the part
[22:49] that I'm good it's going to be a little
[22:51] tricky because angels are not redeemable
[22:56] we know that right but they must be able
[22:59] to make a choice because Park choose to
[23:02] go with the devil and vark choose to go
[23:05] right so they do have it the words
[23:08] spoken by angel with steadfast and every
[23:10] transgression and disobedience received
[23:12] a just recompense recompense of reward
[23:14] in other words they're also going to be
[23:16] judged
[23:17] they'll have to be Bible says will judge
[23:21] angels right so now Paul what are you
[23:25] saying how shall we escape how shall we
[23:28] escape if we neglect so great salvation
[23:31] no words if we turn it down it's far
[23:33] worse on us because we're human beings
[23:36] and we've got a choice to make then how
[23:42] shall we escape if we neglect so great
[23:44] salvation which at the first began to be
[23:47] spoken by the Lord when he was here as
[23:50] Jesus Christ and was confirmed unto us
[23:53] by them that heard he comes remember
[23:54] Paul did hearing Paul wasn't no Paul
[23:58] wasn't a part of Jesus's life in other
[24:01] words but he was confirmed to us by them
[24:03] that heard to him heard him
[24:05] God also bearing them witness who do
[24:09] come out the early disciples 120 in the
[24:12] upper round the ones that come down and
[24:14] James and Peter and all them because he
[24:16] wasn't a part of that he came on Luke
[24:18] you know several years later probably 20
[24:21] years later before Paul even comes on
[24:24] the same and he's getting this
[24:26] information from the disciples but now
[24:29] remember too he's going to interject in
[24:31] him a little while that he went to the
[24:32] backside of the desert and God spoke to
[24:33] him and when he come back him and Peter
[24:36] was saying the same thing see that's the
[24:37] Holy Ghost bang witness God also banged
[24:41] them witness talking about the early
[24:42] disciples both with signs and wonders
[24:45] and with many miracles and gifts of the
[24:48] Holy Ghost according to his own well
[24:49] foreign to the Angels has he not put in
[24:52] subjection the world to come you go back
[24:56] to what we were talking about Paul said
[24:59] unto the Angels what's Paul different
[25:02] Janey's first two chapters an angel
[25:04] Christ in you
[25:06] Christ was made better than the angel
[25:08] the angels are over here and then you're
[25:11] here you're the heirs of salvation let
[25:12] me just
[25:13] just read that because he never said it
[25:15] to an angel he never put the world under
[25:17] subjection to the act to an angel the
[25:21] world under subjection to Jesus Christ
[25:22] and us yes amen we're far into the angel
[25:28] angels he has he not put in subjection
[25:31] the world to come wherever we speak but
[25:33] one in a certain place testified Sam
[25:35] what is man so we get the man that thou
[25:38] art mindful of him or the Son of man
[25:41] that thou visitest him not an angel man
[25:43] thou madest him a little lower than the
[25:46] Angels so here we are he's telling us
[25:48] now thou madest him a little lower than
[25:50] the Angels now why because of us
[25:53] the only reason Christ came as a baby
[25:56] flesh baby person is because of us it's
[25:58] because of the sin curses because of
[26:00] what we did alright cuz I didn't have to
[26:03] do that look he was eternal he was the I
[26:06] am he was Jehovah honey he didn't have
[26:08] to do that but to bring his children
[26:12] back he had to do that and not angels he
[26:15] to put an angel 72 the work he put us
[26:17] but one in a certain place testified
[26:19] saying what is man that thou art mindful
[26:21] of him question work or on the son of
[26:24] man that thou visitest him so to become
[26:26] the son of man he had to be made Lord
[26:30] right there we put that eternal maybe we
[26:32] put that line up there blew this down
[26:34] here is dimensions this dimension
[26:36] wherein he came into this dimension as
[26:39] the son of man hmm
[26:41] he was not the son of man in the
[26:44] beginning the title cause he wasn't
[26:47] guarding human flesh yet this flesh the
[26:51] flesh he picked up he inherited a flesh
[26:54] that inherited eternal life hey man I've
[26:59] been reading the quotes 100 times gonna
[27:00] know exactly what I'm talking about
[27:02] he inherited eternal life in his flesh
[27:04] so that you can inherit eternal life you
[27:07] flex go we get what he gets if he gives
[27:10] somebody change we definitely get a body
[27:12] change alright yes
[27:13] what is man that thou visitest him thou
[27:16] madest him a little lower than the
[27:19] Angels what he brought him down here
[27:21] because remember an angel cannot just
[27:25] step into human flesh and becoming human
[27:28] no now God can take the two angels to
[27:34] Sodom and he can put flesh over room
[27:37] because he was one in control member
[27:39] male character that he was there he said
[27:41] come on Michael come on Gabriel you know
[27:43] what brother Graham gives us an example
[27:44] and he puts the body flesh on but they
[27:47] were not people they were not persons
[27:50] they were in human flesh because God put
[27:52] him in human flesh even God put a little
[27:54] human flesh but he wasn't this human
[27:56] flesh it wasn't milk Cassady that
[27:59] priesthood had to change because
[28:01] remember male calves today we don't see
[28:03] milk anything anymore we see who Jesus
[28:05] Christ the Melchizedek is not he's the
[28:07] high priests but he's not one this was
[28:10] made lower so that he could come into me
[28:12] and you Jesus Christ flesh is what we we
[28:18] hang on the son of man because that was
[28:20] the word make a leg that's right she
[28:23] wants the same with us yeah the word
[28:25] listen the word made of flesh in the Old
[28:28] Testament you understand the difference
[28:32] the word made of flesh called
[28:35] Melchizedek in the Old Testament but
[28:36] that wasn't the word made black this is
[28:40] the word made flesh but that was that
[28:43] was a word that created the flesh and
[28:46] then when he stepped out of this
[28:48] dimension the flesh just he just went
[28:50] right back to dust hey man
[28:53] but this one did indeed even see
[28:56] corruption all same time he hiding he
[28:59] planted him in the earth dead brother
[29:01] Brown I was reading last night cold dead
[29:03] in the grave brother Brown said Jesus
[29:05] and body was cold and dead not a
[29:08] specialised in it but when that the off
[29:11] break the off and he came right back in
[29:13] there he just stood right back up and
[29:14] every cell inside of his body literally
[29:17] changed to a twenty year old person
[29:19] that's what's gonna happen to mean you
[29:21] yes that's why Mary Magdalene didn't
[29:23] know who he was she never seen him at 18
[29:25] 20 years old right but when he but the
[29:30] voice she knew that voice when he said
[29:34] Mary she knew who he was
[29:37] that's why they have a problem isn't
[29:39] that's the whole secret that's why they
[29:41] have a problem with Jesus when he when
[29:43] he returned nobody in the in his full an
[29:46] inner circle of people remember that he
[29:47] was 30 years old when he started
[29:49] bringing this disciples in so nobody had
[29:51] seen him under 30 years old his mama was
[29:53] the only one of me today was already
[29:55] dead maybe his brother James about it
[29:57] but it wasn't the James in the Bible or
[29:59] the disciple James so no I had seen this
[30:03] man in 20 years of no one
[30:05] he was the secret life that what they
[30:08] call the solid years but remember a
[30:12] twenty years old when he stepped out of
[30:14] that tomb Peter didn't really know who
[30:18] he was I mean they really even come walk
[30:20] in the enemy says who are you you no
[30:22] need to give me some fashion and they
[30:24] still didn't believe you reading reading
[30:25] the Bible they still why cuz they see
[30:27] this 20 year old lamb this young guy
[30:29] where they saw this old man this guy
[30:31] looked 50 years old the Bible says he
[30:34] looked 50
[30:35] all right look your brother branham I
[30:37] mean he was 56 when he died if you look
[30:39] at some of the pictures he looks so old
[30:41] because of the wear and tear of hit the
[30:43] ministry that he had then deep-set eyes
[30:47] it was the ministry that really broke
[30:49] him down you know in same way was Jesus
[30:51] Christ and brother Branham was not even
[30:53] respected dirt considered considering
[30:56] Jesus Christ when he was on earth he
[30:57] died for all but everybody sins he took
[30:59] the whole world on its own oh lordy look
[31:01] so old yeah but when he came by young
[31:03] that was to me that's the revelation
[31:05] that's so that's a hidden mystery that
[31:07] he came back a young man yes not an old
[31:10] guy right that was the mystery and then
[31:14] that's the same things gonna happen to
[31:16] us change us back
[31:26] thou made him a little lower than the
[31:28] Angels but now he gets a crown crowns
[31:32] him with glory and honor now what is the
[31:34] glory of Jesus Christ we are the glory
[31:37] of Jesus Christ was where his body yes
[31:39] okay and didn't stand him over the works
[31:43] of thy hands little urgency when he come
[31:45] out of the tomb he said all power and
[31:47] heaven earth
[31:47] given unto me he would be was on his way
[31:50] excuse me to really shift but he had to
[31:53] come back on the day of Pentecost that
[31:54] was a real rulership that's why I Pilate
[31:56] never had a problem with Jesus the king
[32:00] we're gonna this guy's a king we're
[32:02] gonna kill him we're gonna kill him
[32:03] before he becomes our king and pie looks
[32:05] like you don't look very kingly to me
[32:09] you know looks like we just beat him to
[32:11] pieces and you know he was a Roman guy
[32:12] he says I don't think probably all bony
[32:16] and skinny and everything else and he
[32:17] said hey he's no threat to me
[32:21] and Jesus even told him he asked Jesus
[32:23] he said are you gonna establish a
[32:25] kingdom here and he said if my kingdom
[32:27] was a this was no word of my kingdom not
[32:30] of this world my kingdoms of nowhere I
[32:31] was like hey you haven't any more else
[32:33] you just trying to have it here you know
[32:36] so he just really turned him loose but
[32:38] you know what the Jews did they didn't
[32:40] want him to be the king so they want to
[32:41] kill your honor these secular works not
[32:45] him now let's put all things in
[32:46] subjection under his feet now what's
[32:49] Paul saying everything is put under
[32:51] Jesus Christ now we've got everything we
[32:53] need right here this is the man he left
[32:57] nothing that is not put under him but
[32:59] now we see not all things but under him
[33:02] now what was once Paul saying he's still
[33:05] matter buddy yeah because Paul knew his
[33:08] body was getting old but now he knew
[33:11] he's the very preacher that said we
[33:15] plant them in corruption and we raised
[33:16] him in in corruption so he knew there
[33:18] was the body Tang's coming but we don't
[33:22] see all things put under him we don't
[33:25] when he took a body change and came out
[33:28] of that tomb that was for all of us the
[33:30] whole 2,000 years of Christian Dome of
[33:33] the seven churches that changed
[33:36] everybody's body but if brother Graham
[33:40] remember brother Graham said it wasn't
[33:41] applied yet it's not applied for the end
[33:45] time when the son of man comes back in
[33:47] human flesh to do want to change the
[33:50] body all right that's the whole key
[33:53] people think people things that were
[33:55] just in a message that one day our
[33:57] bodies
[33:57] just change it's not it's the word that
[34:02] we got inside of this is what's gonna
[34:03] change our body the man believed in Paul
[34:07] I mean I'm sure Paul long before man he
[34:10] was getting on up there he was getting
[34:11] beat 39 stripes - one several times so I
[34:16] guess he was ready for it - you know he
[34:19] was getting ready to go to the chopping
[34:20] block not too far after this so but now
[34:23] we see not all things yet all things put
[34:25] under him in other words Paul of
[34:26] doubting them in the field it's all
[34:29] great great markers but he knows that
[34:33] this guy this guy took care of all that
[34:40] when he come out when he resurrected
[34:43] everything was studied under his feet
[34:45] because Jesus said all power in him when
[34:47] there's been given unto me in other
[34:48] words boom everything was put but
[34:50] where's the feet of Jesus right now
[34:56] thank you thank you
[34:58] I am the feet of Jesus now you and I
[35:03] it's what's got to come to that place
[35:06] then all the things except you cook left
[35:08] when we take a body change what's left
[35:10] when we come to a place that we can call
[35:13] and speak in the dead come out of the
[35:15] ground and they come among us and then
[35:18] God changes our body what's left all
[35:23] things then have been put under his feet
[35:25] and he's not here right now he's walking
[35:28] in our feet okay so he's doing it
[35:33] through us because watch what did Paul
[35:35] say Paul said I know something's coming
[35:38] he said but let me sum all this up right
[35:41] here but we see Jesus he knows Jesus
[35:45] came out of that tomb and ascended and
[35:49] came back on their Pentecost because he
[35:51] was a recipient not at Pentecost but he
[35:53] was a recipient of the same Holy Ghost
[35:55] they received on the day of Pentecost so
[35:57] he could speak this but we see Jesus who
[36:00] has made a little lower than the Angels
[36:02] for the suffering of death well who
[36:05] suffered death this man right this man
[36:08] didn't
[36:09] the often II God never suffered suffered
[36:12] death but when Jesus came on earth he
[36:15] had that the often inside of him the
[36:17] offering of God inside of him and he
[36:19] couldn't get out because it was there
[36:20] was a shell it was it was something like
[36:22] a capsule that was that was encased
[36:25] around that eternal life so he had to
[36:28] break that at Calvary to release the
[36:31] life to come back only in you so Jesus
[36:34] didn't come to Branson inheritance he
[36:36] brought the inheritance with him he made
[36:37] us a way to get back to the inheritance
[36:39] all right cuz remember if he developed
[36:42] an inheritance down here it's not
[36:45] eternal we're looking at an eternal
[36:49] inheritance
[36:49] all right now but we see Jesus who was
[36:55] made a little lower than the Angels for
[36:57] the suffering of death crowned with
[37:00] glory and honor that he by the grace of
[37:03] God should taste death for every man for
[37:07] it and come him who Jesus for whom are
[37:10] all things and by whom are all things in
[37:13] bringing many sons unto glory to make
[37:17] the captain of their salvation perfect
[37:19] through suffering anybody okay with that
[37:22] perfect through suffering come remember
[37:24] he was perfected let's see what that
[37:28] says
[37:32] complain
[37:37] because really brotherbrother said jesus
[37:41] is not what complete without you so this
[37:44] Jehovah person up here was not complete
[37:46] without a bride yes
[37:48] he wasn't complete that's why he went
[37:51] through the Old Testament doing all he
[37:53] could through the prophets trying to get
[37:54] people to see him but there was a
[37:55] barrier there of blood of bulls and
[37:58] goats not a man's life that was keeping
[38:01] him away
[38:02] you couldn't even open the holy of
[38:04] holies and if you looked at it you died
[38:07] but they looked at it for 30-something
[38:10] years they look this is a very man that
[38:13] was inside that right inside of the Holy
[38:15] of Holies I was looking around at him he
[38:17] became flesh that's why now we can go
[38:21] bowmen to the throne cuz where's the
[38:22] throne the throne Jesus Christ Rowan's
[38:24] not a throne he set up the throne of
[38:26] Jesus Christ for it became him for whom
[38:30] are all things about número things in
[38:31] bringing many sons and the glory to make
[38:33] the captain of their salvation perfect
[38:34] through suffering from both he that
[38:36] sanctifies alright and they who are
[38:42] sanctified are all of two well that
[38:50] looks like two he and they read your
[38:56] Bible he and they but the Bible says are
[39:00] all of one that's right for which cause
[39:04] he is not ashamed to call them brethren
[39:08] saying I will declare thy name unto my
[39:10] brethren and the heads of the church
[39:12] will I sing praises unto thee we'll stop
[39:20] right here and again I will put my trust
[39:22] in him and again behold I and the
[39:25] children which God hath given me a man
[39:30] for as much then as the children are
[39:32] partakers of flesh and blood he also
[39:35] himself likewise took part of the same
[39:37] what flesh and blood that through death
[39:40] he might destroy him that had the
[39:43] death that is the devil and deliver them
[39:46] who through fear of death were all their
[39:48] lifetime subject to bondage everybody
[39:51] was put under bondage of a thing called
[39:55] death and it has conquered temporarily
[39:58] everybody until the day were standing
[40:00] here so and that's let's go see what it
[40:04] says shoved you to slavery Wow
[40:08] that word cuz look verily he took not on
[40:12] him the nature of angels but he took on
[40:14] him the seed of Abraham who you and I
[40:16] are all right let's stop right here will
[40:19] actually stop
[40:24] [Music]
