[0:38] holy
[0:39] holy holy
[0:42] holy holy holy holy
[0:47] amen holy hly holy and I want to
[0:54] see you amen and amen and amen and amen
[0:59] I want to see him don't
[1:00] you so then what do we
[1:03] do we look into his word because it's
[1:06] been delivered unto us and there we can
[1:08] see the day and the hour that we're
[1:10] living and you know we can find him the
[1:14] prophet said if you can't see Christ in
[1:17] every verse he said go back and read it
[1:19] again he said because you missed it all
[1:22] right so that's what we're looking for
[1:24] right Christ not necessarily the word
[1:28] Jesus but the Christ
[1:30] is the main point right amen good to see
[1:32] everybody in the house of the Lord
[1:34] remember now that this coming Sunday now
[1:38] Friday we're leaving to go up if anybody
[1:40] else wants to go along with us up to the
[1:42] Ruth meeting we run up Friday night and
[1:44] come back so you got to let us know
[1:46] tonight where we can make any kind of
[1:48] arrangements or whatever to go up but we
[1:51] have to leave here about
[1:54] 1:30 Friday to be able to go so that's
[1:58] just if you want to go with us we'll try
[2:00] to haul year whatever we can do but just
[2:02] remember that and all right then
[2:04] remember this coming Sunday brother
[2:07] George Quinn from Ireland will be with
[2:09] us ministering for us on Sunday Services
[2:12] then brother Keith Reed from Jamaica
[2:15] will be with us on Wednesday the 10th
[2:18] and then brother Nester from the
[2:20] Philippines will be with us on the 14th
[2:23] and I'm sure every time we get there
[2:26] Friday night that they'll be more added
[2:28] to the D and I really enjoyed brother uh
[2:32] Serano this past weekend I thought he'
[2:35] done a marvelous job I told him that was
[2:37] the best things did from the pull pits
[2:39] you know that's best I've heard him
[2:40] preach and I really enjoyed it because
[2:42] it was good and I pray that we're going
[2:45] to be blessed by all who comes to speak
[2:48] to us because that's the desire of our
[2:50] heart right is for the lord to bless and
[2:53] help each one of us so remember that
[2:55] okay Terren made one announcement but
[2:58] I'll make this one uh remember that uh
[3:02] the church wants to welcome Thomas into
[3:04] our church family and to help out on the
[3:07] expenses and things or getting things to
[3:10] whatever to do to him and all they will
[3:12] have a money tree it will not be put up
[3:16] now until August the
[3:18] 28th okay so don't look for it and try
[3:21] to do but the reason they're saying a
[3:23] money tree is because you know you try
[3:25] to buy this and you buy that and and all
[3:27] like that and I'm sure he would like to
[3:29] have it but uh you know it' be better to
[3:32] have the money where they can go and buy
[3:35] the things that he will need and then
[3:38] that that Sunday the 28th there will be
[3:41] after the evening service will be uh the
[3:44] fact of having cake and ice cream and so
[3:47] just remember that I'll keep that in my
[3:50] in my Bible where I remember to announce
[3:52] it
[3:55] so if you'd like turn in your scriptures
[3:57] to Revelations 3 and 4 we'll try to pick
[4:01] up where we left off last Wednesday and
[4:04] we're going
[4:05] to try to get up to a point tonight and
[4:09] cut off and then uh it will be a couple
[4:12] of weeks before we'll be back to
[4:15] Ministry so that gives you time to kind
[4:18] of think things over and meditate in
[4:20] your mind as to what's being said now we
[4:24] covered last Wednesday we spoke about
[4:28] how that the ministry of Jesus
[4:33] Christ it it it will have to be in the
[4:36] bride of Christ and we're talking about
[4:38] that but to see the ministry of Jesus
[4:41] Christ in many stages now and maybe you
[4:44] don't understand my word stages or
[4:46] whatever mean it just means a process
[4:49] that he went through and he we'll go
[4:52] back to it a little that he gave this
[4:54] and then he gave this and then he gave
[4:56] this and he just kept instilling into
[4:59] the AP Apostles the
[5:01] ministry all right see then we're going
[5:04] to come on in toward our day if we can
[5:08] but we're getting to that point okay
[5:10] Revelations 3 and Malachi 4 father we
[5:14] thank you for tonight we thank you for
[5:16] your love and your grace Lord unto us
[5:18] and we pray that you would just bless us
[5:20] now with your presence that you'd speak
[5:22] to our hearts that we may see you and
[5:25] want to walk in your love forgive our
[5:27] sins and guide each and every one of us
[5:29] remember the sick among us remember what
[5:31] you said Lord we just remind you of what
[5:34] you said through the prophet that Lord
[5:37] that you wanted to heal us more than we
[5:40] wanted to be healed and we thank you for
[5:42] that then in your word you said that you
[5:44] sent your word and healed us and
[5:46] delivered us from destruction so we can
[5:48] anchor into your word we love you and we
[5:51] thank you have your way in each one in
[5:54] Jesus name amen
[5:57] amen all right
[6:00] Revelations
[6:03] 3
[6:05] 14 and I would ask
[6:07] you U let's see it'll be a couple of
[6:11] weeks but read
[6:15] Zachariah and read that in
[6:19] comparison with Malachi
[6:23] 4 all right you got Malachi 4 read it in
[6:27] comparison in Zechariah what is it
[6:31] 10 U is that the scripture Zechariah 10
[6:34] where he talks about The Headstone
[6:36] coming crying Grace Grace unto it read
[6:39] those in relation and just read them
[6:40] over and over and say well now he told
[6:42] us to do this so let's see where it all
[6:45] fits together okay and unto the angel of
[6:48] the Church of the lady o and right these
[6:50] things sayth the amen the faithful and
[6:52] true witness who is he the beginning of
[6:55] the creation of God all right Malachi 4
[6:59] verse vers four remember ye the law of
[7:01] Moses remember what I said the entire
[7:03] Bible is backed up backing up what he's
[7:07] going to say as the last few verses will
[7:11] Express what is you know has been is and
[7:15] will be all in these verses to where we
[7:19] can understand remember ye the law of
[7:21] Moses my servant which I commanded unto
[7:24] him in horb for all Israel with the
[7:26] statutes and the Judgment remember now
[7:28] what we said to you the Prophet said
[7:29] what are we talking about the Ten
[7:31] Commandments the law the thing he said
[7:34] the law was God in letter
[7:38] form now the law was God in the letter
[7:41] form it wasn't a book of rules it was a
[7:44] revelation of a person and that person
[7:47] is almighty God okay now watch behold I
[7:51] will send you Elijah the prophet before
[7:54] the coming of the great and Dreadful day
[7:56] of the Lord okay now the promise
[8:00] but there's uh three things
[8:03] involved with this verse
[8:07] 5 see because right where it go behold I
[8:10] send you Elijah the prophet before the
[8:12] coming of the great and Dreadful day of
[8:14] the Lord okay John the Baptist is
[8:18] coming right number five uh three then
[8:24] the prophet to the Gentiles is in
[8:26] included there number four then number
[8:28] five
[8:29] the two witnesses so now you see why I
[8:32] said that verse four he says I'm I'm
[8:35] putting the whole Old Testament
[8:37] everything is backing up what I'm going
[8:39] to say now I'm going to tell you what
[8:42] I'm going to
[8:43] do okay I'm going to send you Elijah the
[8:47] prophet before the coming of the great
[8:49] and Dreadful day of the Lord now watch
[8:52] and he shall turn the heart of the
[8:54] fathers to the children and the Heart of
[8:57] the children to the their fathers lest I
[9:00] come and smite the Earth with a curse
[9:03] you may be seated the Lord add his
[9:05] Blessing to the reading of the word now
[9:09] not just saying a point to where that
[9:12] you'll keep it in your mind to
[9:16] think as I said three things is covered
[9:19] in verse
[9:21] 5 John the Baptist brother brandham
[9:24] coming in the last days and then the two
[9:27] witnesses to Israel
[9:29] is included in that one
[9:31] verse all right now you say but
[9:35] now I say things sometimes to make you
[9:37] think you say yeah but we we we've only
[9:40] got a couple of things in verse
[9:43] six yeah but that's where you're going
[9:45] to miss
[9:46] it CU see John the Baptist according to
[9:50] Luke
[9:52] 1:7 John the Baptist turned the Old
[9:55] Testament
[9:56] people to the New Testament men message
[9:59] pointed out Jesus Christ Behold the Lamb
[10:02] of God takes away the sin of the world
[10:04] all right introducing him turning the
[10:06] hearts of watch now to the fathers to
[10:08] the children now watch listen he didn't
[10:12] turn them from Deep things to baby
[10:15] things that's what that sounds
[10:18] like fathers to
[10:22] children that's what our mind to get in
[10:24] there and
[10:25] thinking you mean he went from father
[10:27] things to children
[10:29] things no it's not meaning that it's
[10:32] meaning the what who are the
[10:35] children who was the children that wound
[10:38] up accepting this part of Malachi 4 that
[10:41] we talk
[10:42] about that would be the John the
[10:46] Baptist part of the ministry right all
[10:49] right who was it the disciples y that's
[10:53] right and look at the height they were
[10:56] and I've got the quotes in here at home
[10:59] either way brother Brown said those
[11:00] disciples had these
[11:03] virtues but he said they didn't have the
[11:05] headstone cuz it hadn't come yet now
[11:07] that's right so hold your point now so
[11:11] then see when he turned them he didn't
[11:14] turn them from great deep understandings
[11:18] of the
[11:21] fathers he simply brought into
[11:24] being a new testament
[11:27] amen right A New
[11:31] Testament and he started that new
[11:33] testament on the day of Pentecost
[11:37] right with the apostles the the
[11:41] disciples that come to that place and
[11:44] they came to what we call the faith of
[11:48] the fathers amen all
[11:51] right now I want you to follow that
[11:54] thought see then you you'll see exactly
[11:57] what I'm talking about see then the next
[11:59] part is to turn the hearts of the
[12:04] children
[12:07] back to their
[12:10] fathers all
[12:11] right now as I said the other day on
[12:16] it it's been taught by people I've heard
[12:19] it even in this message to try to make
[12:21] it a beautiful point but it doesn't work
[12:22] too good because you take in Luke 117
[12:26] there and he'll turn the hearts of the
[12:29] Old Testament to the children's message
[12:31] but in a minute it says he turns them
[12:33] back to this well I searched for it till
[12:36] I found it where the Prophet said he
[12:39] didn't turn them to the New Testament
[12:41] and then turn around and turn them back
[12:42] to the old that's paraphrasing it but
[12:45] it's right cuz that wouldn't
[12:47] work that part is saying simply that he
[12:51] turned them to the faith not his
[12:56] babies right the new New Testament never
[12:59] begun listen as
[13:02] babies the New Testament
[13:04] began first with the 120 in the upper
[13:07] room right amen now then we talk about
[13:11] dropping Downs to babes in Christ
[13:14] remember go we come outside until the
[13:17] 3000 now they start as babies but those
[13:21] disciples receed the Holy Ghost right
[13:23] here but then we should receive it down
[13:26] here the rest get it down into faith
[13:29] all right then you say yeah but said you
[13:32] only got two parts CU you got a turning
[13:34] from the Old Testament to the new and
[13:37] then look like we're going to turn
[13:39] back well
[13:42] listen we are not even involved
[13:47] here as the natural
[13:52] story cuz God will one
[13:56] day restore Israel
[14:00] under that fifth
[14:03] Elijah he will take them back from that
[14:09] Faith the New Testament point he'll take
[14:12] them not back to the
[14:14] law
[14:16] no he'll take them into Glory with the
[14:18] rest of us now they have their place
[14:22] they won't be bride we know that but see
[14:26] just in case you you miss that point
[14:29] of thinking about well Malachi he went
[14:31] this way not that way
[14:33] no just get it and then get us in the
[14:36] middle all
[14:38] right just get us in the
[14:41] middle okay get us as a faith of those
[14:45] Old Testament Saints moved over into the
[14:48] early
[14:50] church Paul took the Old
[14:54] Testament and brought his sermons to a
[14:58] new Testament people to show them the
[15:01] revelation of Jesus Christ true amen
[15:05] right all right standing on that one God
[15:07] see then we drifted away from that down
[15:09] to the ages so that's got to be
[15:13] restored back to the faith of the
[15:18] father you may not have got nothing out
[15:20] of that but one of these days it'll
[15:22] don't on you say well okay he said it
[15:25] now and I believe it all right because
[15:28] maybe I don't say it in your
[15:31] terminologies but I try to say it the
[15:33] best that I
[15:34] can all right now to start with what
[15:38] we're wanting to do
[15:41] tonight the prophet of God
[15:44] said that you and I are living way
[15:48] below our privileges yes he said living
[15:52] millions of
[15:53] miles
[15:56] below our privileges
[16:00] he said our
[16:02] God the whole Christian church today is
[16:06] living thousands of miles Bel their
[16:09] god-given privilege that's right watch
[16:13] because of just so half
[16:16] asleep right amen I didn't say
[16:21] that because of just so half asleep this
[16:25] small life he says take the promise
[16:29] believe it God said so that settles it
[16:34] forever amen take the promise all right
[16:38] but we're living below our privilege
[16:40] because we're not taking the promise
[16:42] right
[16:43] amen now I do believe one thing for
[16:46] certain it does say in Malachi behold I
[16:49] send
[16:50] you Elijah the prophet all right we
[16:54] ought to believe it for that but he said
[16:56] then to than that the day that we're
[16:57] living
[16:59] and so many people cut off that
[17:02] privilege from the people why we're
[17:05] living millions of
[17:07] miles below our god-given
[17:10] privilege right the Church of the Living
[17:13] God should never be divided we should be
[17:16] one and together all right living below
[17:21] our
[17:23] privileges
[17:25] okay now you know what living below your
[17:28] privileges of a definition from what
[17:30] he's saying there is being expressed to
[17:34] us we're not believing what God has
[17:40] said do you say I believe it I believe
[17:43] it I believe
[17:45] everything there's people right
[17:47] now that won't go to church at all won't
[17:51] Fellowship in the church
[17:53] whatsoever but yet they're saying they
[17:55] believe everything he said well the
[17:56] prophets wouldn't said and the Bible is
[17:59] when it said forsake not the assembly
[18:02] okay but you see we can say we believe
[18:08] everything I think would to be like the
[18:10] lady one time that um that she was
[18:13] somebody was talking about the uh White
[18:15] Horse Rider and the things and I
[18:17] remember this story was told way back
[18:19] that this lady said well you know
[18:21] somebody said well we One Believes it
[18:23] this way and one believes that say what
[18:24] do you believe said I believe it both
[18:26] ways well at least one thing she had a
[18:30] 50/50 change of being right the others
[18:33] that didn't believe it didn't even have
[18:35] a change my brother-in-law used to have
[18:37] a saying he said if you're out in the
[18:39] woods hunting and you see a deer he said
[18:42] if you fire the gun you got a 50/50
[18:45] chance of getting a deer but said if you
[18:46] don't fire it's total zero so that's the
[18:51] way we ought to be maybe the lady was
[18:54] better off than most of us cuzz she said
[18:57] she B Le you both ways well we're we're
[19:01] not making light of nobody but it's just
[19:02] a
[19:03] truth all
[19:05] right because what our problem is living
[19:08] below our
[19:09] privilege is that we're not taking what
[19:14] the Bible says and when I say it like
[19:17] that I'm meaning the Bible and what
[19:19] brother Brandon says or reverse if you
[19:21] want to what brother Brown said and the
[19:23] Bible says either way you want to do it
[19:25] because I believe that's the way it came
[19:26] to us I don't believe he come to bring
[19:29] us another Bible or
[19:30] nothing he he come to speak to us about
[19:33] the Bible all right see then doing that
[19:35] see the way we're living below our
[19:37] privileges we're not believing what he's
[19:39] saying about
[19:41] us that's right now you say well them
[19:44] people out there they're living below
[19:46] their
[19:47] privilege now that wasn't what he said
[19:49] that's right he said we I just read it
[19:52] to you if you want me to read it again
[19:53] he said the Church of the Living God I
[19:56] think if we want to call ourselves that
[19:59] that we ought to realize that we're
[20:00] living below our privilege amen and what
[20:04] is living below your privilege not
[20:07] believing not believing it's for you
[20:09] right that's
[20:12] right what is the big thing that brother
[20:14] ROM says then if it if he says it it
[20:18] evidently the Bible says it what is the
[20:21] greatest
[20:22] problem with the Christian
[20:25] realm he said they're always looking
[20:27] back
[20:30] right to what was looking forward to
[20:35] what will
[20:36] be and missing what's going on now may I
[20:39] put another quote in
[20:41] there
[20:43] okay the prophet
[20:46] said that people are
[20:51] looking for a great move of
[20:54] God a worldwide sweeping Revival he said
[20:58] not realizing that's already taking
[21:01] place that's right on isusa Street
[21:03] that's right not to do away with the
[21:05] Revival
[21:07] no that was a worldwide sweeping Revival
[21:10] and there's not to be another one watch
[21:12] him now watch him go from there over
[21:14] here he says and the next thing to put
[21:18] that in line cuz he said that's they're
[21:20] failing to see Pentecost he said and the
[21:23] next
[21:24] thing they're looking at through the two
[21:27] Prophets
[21:28] through the two prophets there will be a
[21:30] great worldwide sweeping Revival I
[21:34] believe only in Israel because you could
[21:37] say everywhere else and bring them home
[21:38] if you want to but it's still for the
[21:40] Israelites right it ain't for the world
[21:43] cuz there ain't going to be nowhere
[21:44] white sweeping but brother R said
[21:45] they're seeing what is promised to
[21:48] Israel and think that is pertaining to
[21:51] them all right so now then what we need
[21:54] to do is find what's promised to
[21:57] us
[21:59] okay the point about a Revival what did
[22:01] the prophet say he said the bride hadn't
[22:03] had a Revival yet that's right he said
[22:06] it'll take them seven unknown Thunders
[22:08] to wake her up that's right
[22:12] okay so then we have that point to look
[22:14] forward to we're supposed to be having
[22:17] I've been having Revival ever since I've
[22:19] been in this message because when I see
[22:21] the word unfold and see God make it
[22:26] manifest then I take that as being the
[22:30] greatest Revival that could ever be in
[22:32] the worlden Y he's only one of you well
[22:37] that's all I thought it going to be if
[22:38] you want to leave Georgia and go to
[22:39] another state you'll be all right you
[22:42] know what I mean by that where he said
[22:44] this one out of a state so then you
[22:47] throw it me I throw it back to you see
[22:49] we're not in that realm of that right
[22:52] the prophet wouldn't saying just one out
[22:54] he would just explaining a small amount
[22:57] not
[22:58] you remember what he said to
[23:01] U is it right I believe it's right maton
[23:03] Bose was he the one that said that
[23:05] Chicago would be shook there's a quote
[23:08] in there I believe that's right isn't he
[23:10] and brother randam went around and told
[23:11] him he said it's already taking place
[23:14] see he was looking for something trying
[23:16] to find it brother R said it's already
[23:18] taken place what God's word had hit the
[23:23] town see we're looking for something
[23:26] instead of looking at what
[23:29] is all right now as I said what did we
[23:32] cover the last
[23:34] time the ministry the same Ministry of
[23:37] Jesus
[23:39] Christ in
[23:42] stages all
[23:44] right I've Illustrated that of what I'm
[23:47] saying you wonder why I was bringing it
[23:49] I Illustrated that by the five times of
[23:53] Elijah we know that two has already
[23:55] happened you know then John the Baptist
[23:57] was a third third brother Ram is the
[23:59] fourth and the Elijah of the so that's
[24:01] stages
[24:03] right now each one of those
[24:07] ministries of the ministry of
[24:10] Elijah was by five different
[24:14] men with
[24:16] different
[24:19] uh ways and thoughts and
[24:22] doings you can't take Elijah and bring
[24:26] him down here today he'd be in jail for
[24:29] night
[24:31] right
[24:33] right you take the Elijah of this day
[24:37] and put him back there he'd be dead for
[24:40] night all right you understand what I'm
[24:43] getting out cuz tonight we're going to
[24:45] talk about the same Ministry of Jesus
[24:49] Christ but in different
[24:51] stages where you'll understand the point
[24:55] I'm driving
[24:56] at
[24:58] different stages of the ministry of
[25:01] Jesus
[25:03] Christ it might be surprising so if I
[25:05] was you I'd pay a little attention
[25:07] instead of trying to figure out
[25:09] everything I would listen all right see
[25:13] living below our
[25:15] privileges because we don't believe what
[25:18] is being said about you and
[25:22] I right now forgive me for putting it
[25:25] that way this Bible
[25:29] has only been fulfilled up to the part
[25:32] where we're at it has not been fulfilled
[25:36] to
[25:37] Israel that's after we leave right
[25:40] that's right Right There Was An Old
[25:43] Testament there is a new testament
[25:45] that's different
[25:46] stages all right so are you following me
[25:49] now so we're going to look
[25:52] through the ministry of Jesus
[25:55] Christ and come down to the day it where
[25:58] we're
[25:59] living all right I said some things and
[26:02] I want to repeat some of it as we go
[26:05] along there our Wednesday
[26:06] night I even made a statement I heard
[26:10] this P ever when it was I
[26:12] preached I made a
[26:15] statement I said Jesus never told him
[26:19] disciples to lay hands on them for the
[26:21] Holy
[26:24] Ghost my point was it had not been given
[26:29] so it wouldn't work I don't think I
[26:31] don't know the scriptures to where they
[26:33] get in the book of Acts and lay hands on
[26:35] the people but just remember there's
[26:37] another thought goes for that you can't
[26:40] just go out and lay hands on anybody and
[26:42] them receive the Holy
[26:45] Ghost right the Holy Ghost ain't going
[26:48] to come on a person that's not
[26:51] repented now you can get by on the water
[26:53] baptism for a little bit but he's going
[26:54] to the water quick as he can right yes
[26:57] sir but you get the point now of listen
[27:00] and think about it and then you'll find
[27:03] out when I say something check it and
[27:05] put it in its
[27:08] category of where it's supposed to be so
[27:11] we went through like Mark
[27:13] 6 now they don't have these so I'm just
[27:16] run across it like Mark
[27:19] 6 the disciples went out and he told
[27:22] them to preach
[27:25] repentance he told them to cast out
[27:27] devils anoint with
[27:30] oil many of that were sick and healed
[27:33] them now that was the ministry of Jesus
[27:36] Christ given to the
[27:40] disciples right it wasn't given to
[27:44] everybody amen it was only given to the
[27:48] disciples all
[27:52] right he went on to tell them on another
[27:55] part of tell them from Matthew 10 we
[27:57] were talking about go ye and preach
[27:59] saying the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand
[28:01] he told him to do that he said heal the
[28:04] sick cleanse the lepers raise the
[28:08] Dead cast out
[28:11] Devils freely you receive freely
[28:15] give he gets over in Mark
[28:19] 16 just as after I think this is
[28:21] actually after his Ascension he tells
[28:24] them these sign shall follow them that
[28:26] believe in my name so they cast out
[28:28] devil speak with new tongues they take
[28:30] up serpents if they drink any deadly
[28:31] thing it shall not hurt them they shall
[28:33] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[28:35] recover all right
[28:39] now I was trying to show it in
[28:42] stages that Jesus gave to the
[28:45] disciples things they could
[28:49] do they could heal the sick they can
[28:51] cast out devils and
[28:54] remember in the book of Acts that Judas
[28:56] had a part of of the ministry that's
[28:58] right
[29:01] right let me say something and then I'll
[29:04] say it we repeat it
[29:06] later you know that brother ROM said the
[29:10] third pool
[29:12] is for the
[29:16] bride for the
[29:19] church and two the total lost right you
[29:25] might remember that
[29:27] see a lot of people think well those
[29:29] people are not in the
[29:35] message you know we probably turn out to
[29:37] be like the man
[29:39] was
[29:44] that he said there's a fell over
[29:48] here that's casting out devils and
[29:51] things but said he's not one of
[29:54] us shall we go stop him that's right you
[29:58] remember that in the scripture I got it
[29:59] in here ate a while but shall we go stop
[30:02] him what did Jesus
[30:06] say he said leave him
[30:08] alone he says because he's for us he
[30:11] ain't against
[30:14] us in other words he's
[30:17] taken what he's been given to you and
[30:21] believing
[30:22] it and it's
[30:24] working
[30:26] right so now you'll see my whole thought
[30:28] tonight is believing it's for
[30:31] you if you don't believe it's for you it
[30:33] won't never do you no
[30:36] good but you see he gave him
[30:39] things
[30:43] that then he promised them
[30:47] things he promised them in Mark 16 I
[30:50] believe it
[30:53] is he told him go preach to to heal the
[30:58] sick speak in tongues and things and
[31:02] said there'll be great things happening
[31:05] Jesus spoke of a time to come right
[31:08] right
[31:09] amen he spoke of a time to come that
[31:12] they would do greater things than they
[31:15] had
[31:17] done right that's
[31:19] right Greater
[31:21] Works would be
[31:26] done and what is that the prophet said
[31:29] that was part of the ministry of Jesus
[31:32] Christ but follow what I'm saying now
[31:36] listen see while he was here they could
[31:39] only do certain things that's right but
[31:43] yet they could heal the sick cast that
[31:45] devil raise the dead wonderful
[31:47] things they could preach about the
[31:51] kingdom but they couldn't preach the
[31:53] kingdom why because it hadn't come yet
[32:00] yeah they could speak Maybe by listening
[32:03] to Jesus with what he would say about
[32:05] the Holy Spirit
[32:06] coming but it had not come in their
[32:08] lives so they didn't know anything about
[32:10] it that's right but listen to what I'm
[32:13] saying there's the ministry of Jesus
[32:17] Christ to heal the sick cast out Devils
[32:21] raise the
[32:23] dead speak in you tongues
[32:30] what about the worldly Church system or
[32:32] the church system today amen are they
[32:35] not casting out
[32:38] Devils Healing The
[32:41] Sick raising the
[32:45] dead speaking in
[32:48] tongues am I
[32:51] right so let me say what Jesus said
[32:55] hey if they're not against against
[32:57] us and it's
[33:01] working let's don't worry about
[33:04] it right you see what I said that's
[33:07] right see the Lord Jesus said if that
[33:10] guy is doing something leave him alone
[33:12] cuz he ain't against us that's right cuz
[33:14] he's found some
[33:17] way now I got them laying here if you'd
[33:19] like that brother Brandon says you can
[33:22] take so much of the
[33:23] word and make it work sure that's right
[33:28] you say how does that work for them to
[33:30] heal the sick cast that devil even raise
[33:33] the
[33:34] dead it's because they
[33:38] believe that it's for
[33:41] them
[33:44] right see the disciples had to believe
[33:47] even Judas being part he had to
[33:51] believe that what they had Jesus had
[33:54] given
[33:55] them right right
[33:58] amen you know what he had sure you know
[34:01] what it's just listed as the one guy you
[34:04] know but still that's enough but the one
[34:06] guy he picks it up you know for some way
[34:09] and you know what he does he starts
[34:10] going out and he starts doing great
[34:13] Miracles he doesn't list him as a Simon
[34:16] the Sorcerer that's through tricks is
[34:18] causing this side or the other right in
[34:20] the book of Acts right no this guy was
[34:23] doing some works that's why I'm not
[34:26] against what's out there
[34:28] brother Ram wasn't against that that's
[34:30] where he went that's right he wasn't
[34:34] against the world system he was against
[34:36] the system of the
[34:40] church
[34:42] right he believed in their healings and
[34:45] signs and
[34:46] wonders he spoke of those men with great
[34:50] signs and
[34:52] wonders the war Roberts and all of those
[34:55] men he spoke of them
[34:58] right you know what it worked you know
[35:01] what it's still working now I'm going to
[35:03] hurt you know what they've got more than
[35:05] we
[35:10] have come
[35:14] on there's more signs and wonders out
[35:17] there than there are among the Bride of
[35:19] Jesus Christ well we're just a small
[35:21] amount oh you can sit there and excuse
[35:23] all you want to just get the point it's
[35:26] working
[35:29] if it's working in their
[35:31] lives God is the only one that can
[35:35] heal God is the only one can raise the
[35:38] dead God is the only one can do those
[35:40] things
[35:44] right are you with me that's right it
[35:48] doesn't work just because we believe it
[35:49] and we think
[35:52] it well we got gifts right whatever you
[35:55] got it's working
[36:03] right you go talk to
[36:06] people talking to one just recently
[36:09] about some things that I hope he's
[36:11] listening
[36:14] tonight because I was talking to him
[36:16] about signs and you know what he was
[36:18] telling me about signs and
[36:20] wonders he was telling me about things
[36:25] happening I did argue with
[36:28] him I didn't say oh you just don't know
[36:30] what's going on no I tried my best to
[36:34] explain one
[36:35] thing all that is because of
[36:39] Christ and what people can believe right
[36:42] but we're not interested in just Healing
[36:44] The Sick casting out
[36:47] Devils we're interested in the change of
[36:50] a body amen and this message came for
[36:54] that purpose that's right
[36:58] not to bring Divine Healing it was
[37:00] already there not to bring raising the
[37:02] dead it was already
[37:05] there well I just can't see how them
[37:08] denominations to raise a
[37:12] dead that's what I'm
[37:14] saying when you say I can't see it you
[37:18] know what that
[37:19] means it means your mind is shut off
[37:23] from the truth that's right
[37:25] right
[37:29] and say that again when you say I can't
[37:32] see it I just don't see anything going
[37:34] on that means your mind is cut off from
[37:38] the truth I'm trying to show you even
[37:40] the denominations even the worldly
[37:43] Church systems even the things out there
[37:46] the sick is being healed the Dead's
[37:48] being raised devils are being cast out
[37:50] things are happening right
[37:55] right
[37:58] right oh of course you don't believe
[38:01] that
[38:04] yeah but you see Church why I can stand
[38:07] and say like I did the other day and I
[38:09] got in trouble years ago about when I
[38:11] said it I stay in trouble I guess that's
[38:13] all
[38:15] right but when I ask a woman preacher to
[38:18] pray for somebody that was sick in this
[38:21] church I don't want no woman preach to
[38:23] pray me I don't care if it's a pope
[38:27] wrong he can touch God for me but what
[38:31] you're afraid of you your's afraid right
[38:34] you afraid that woman preacher will
[38:37] touch God and and and really what it is
[38:39] she touches the devil and the devil
[38:41] Moves In in a certain way and he does
[38:42] over and he takes care of all these
[38:44] demons and he gets all this stuff worked
[38:46] out and you're afraid that devil to get
[38:47] on
[38:52] you there ain't no devil can
[38:55] heal right I don't don't care how much
[38:57] you think right that's
[38:59] right ain't no devil can
[39:02] heal that's
[39:05] right but just
[39:10] remember I know people that are scared
[39:12] of certain
[39:13] things you know
[39:17] what according to the
[39:20] prophet and a
[39:22] Bible the things that job
[39:25] feared
[39:27] Came Upon
[39:28] him so if you're afraid to step out move
[39:33] over get out of the
[39:37] way don't stand around well I just don't
[39:40] see nothing going
[39:42] on I know that this great things happen
[39:44] happen just happen but I just don't see
[39:46] nothing going on what are you looking
[39:52] for see what are you looking
[39:55] for
[39:58] what is
[40:00] it that we as a church are looking
[40:04] [Music]
[40:07] for and where is our great signs and
[40:10] wonders that we would think would
[40:12] accompany it see there you look
[40:15] back you're looking back to the days of
[40:17] William
[40:18] brandham so do I when I read it and sat
[40:21] and listen to tapes and rejoice and hear
[40:23] those people screaming and holling they
[40:25] being healed I do
[40:28] too and you're looking to one of these
[40:30] days some magical something is going to
[40:36] transpire and you're going to walk off
[40:38] the
[40:41] earth well I've said this 45 50 years
[40:44] ago I'll just keep on saying
[40:47] it the Bible
[40:50] says if you can't keep up with the
[40:54] footman said what about when the
[40:57] horsemen get here
[41:01] right other words if you can't live and
[41:04] survive daily don't think there's some
[41:07] great thing to come that's going to take
[41:10] you through that's
[41:14] right the scripture said what if you
[41:16] can't abide in the what is it what about
[41:18] it in the in the swelling of
[41:23] Jordan I'm not worried about what's
[41:25] coming
[41:27] I have nothing to do with what's coming
[41:29] God will bring to P what he will bring
[41:32] to P sir I just don't want to miss it
[41:36] and I know one thing for certain may I
[41:38] say it over time how many times have
[41:39] ever said
[41:41] this we're supposed to get on the bus
[41:44] tonight you know we're going to get on
[41:46] the bus about 9:00 well we're all going
[41:49] down
[41:50] to airport down Atlanta heartsville
[41:53] airport
[41:55] why
[41:57] we're going to get on the
[41:59] bus well that's not a bus that's an
[42:04] airplan you said I've heard you say that
[42:07] 500 times what do you mean I mean one
[42:10] thing for
[42:12] certain now I quote brother random he
[42:15] said being in the wrong
[42:18] ranks at the
[42:20] Rapture listen is no excuse that's right
[42:25] that's phrase a little bit but it's very
[42:27] close I can find it for
[42:30] you being in the wrong rank what do it
[42:32] mean to be in the wrong
[42:34] ranks you military guys what is the
[42:37] wrong
[42:40] ranks
[42:43] right if you're a whole step out and
[42:46] walking you're in
[42:48] step
[42:49] right you just make a crooked
[42:52] line but if your high for step out
[42:56] that's where you get to pick up all the
[42:58] little butts and dig the holes and bury
[42:59] them and thing when the sergeant gets to
[43:01] with you
[43:03] right because you're in the wrong
[43:08] ranks I didn't make those statements
[43:10] your Prophet
[43:12] did but you see
[43:15] Church didn't we bul and stall over the
[43:19] things a prophet
[43:21] says and you claim that we believe all
[43:24] he
[43:25] says
[43:30] what about where he told the disciples
[43:32] that we were on last
[43:35] service John
[43:38] 14:12 said the works I do shall you do
[43:42] also and greater
[43:45] works now I like to read all the
[43:48] scripture I've been through 50 years
[43:50] long enough to listen at
[43:52] people they'll read you a high of the
[43:54] scripture and stop
[43:57] man down at Athens used to preach and
[43:59] boy he'd hammered to death woman shall
[44:01] be
[44:02] saved in
[44:06] childbearing and he
[44:09] just so one day I asked him out in front
[44:13] I said brother would you mind reading or
[44:15] quoting the rest of that
[44:17] scripture what do you mean I'll give you
[44:19] a scripture this is the scripture said
[44:22] she shall be saved in childbearing if
[44:26] she continue in the faith
[44:29] right you know what he didn't like
[44:35] that but you see we take the
[44:38] part on the Greater
[44:40] Works and then we go into all of the
[44:43] lengths of trying to figure out greater
[44:45] more whatever you
[44:47] know why not just read the rest of what
[44:50] Jesus
[44:52] said the works I
[44:54] do
[44:56] shall you do
[44:58] also in Greater
[45:02] Works that gives you the key in the rest
[45:05] of the scripture what dides he say he
[45:08] said because I go to my father that's
[45:11] right there's not going to be any
[45:12] Greater
[45:13] Works that was what I was trying my best
[45:16] to get you to see the other day the
[45:18] disciples while they were here heal the
[45:20] sick cast out Devils raise the dead but
[45:23] they could not do the Greater Works
[45:27] right
[45:30] right
[45:31] right why cuz he hadn't been to the
[45:37] father
[45:40] right see we read the scriptures out of
[45:42] our
[45:47] thoughts and we just speak what we want
[45:50] to
[45:51] speak
[45:54] right but the prophet of God remember he
[45:57] we gave you the scriptures gave you all
[45:58] the
[46:00] things but he said it was given to the
[46:02] disciples to impart eternal life and now
[46:07] we how can that be done
[46:09] with we got all kind of
[46:14] explanations and what did your Prophet
[46:19] say he said it was given to imp part
[46:22] eternal
[46:24] life he said now the Catholics they say
[46:27] they impart eternal life or forgive sins
[46:29] because he use it
[46:34] interchangeably and what did he
[46:36] say he said now here's the scriptures if
[46:39] you'll follow
[46:44] that he said repent everyone and be
[46:46] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[46:48] the remission of sin and you shall
[46:49] receive the gift of the Holy
[46:54] Ghost right so how do you impart eternal
[47:00] life said can a man do that come on roll
[47:05] it up let's start on number one we'll
[47:06] get a little
[47:09] bit we talk about
[47:12] this ministry in
[47:17] stages so if you understand what I'm
[47:19] getting
[47:20] at you had the stages
[47:24] or different
[47:27] phases points or whatever the words you
[47:29] want to
[47:30] use you had things with the disciples
[47:33] that
[47:34] worked right you have things today that
[47:42] work
[47:46] right but
[47:48] now I'm going to make it
[47:54] hard
[47:56] we'll read it
[47:58] then that Jesus could not even preach
[48:01] the baptism of the Holy
[48:06] Spirit
[48:10] why he was God allmighty he could
[48:12] forgive sins he could do all kind of
[48:14] things he was a son of
[48:16] man but he could not impart eternal
[48:21] life
[48:24] right
[48:27] he could not impart eternal life
[48:33] why because he had not went to the
[48:35] father and that's what he
[48:37] said Greater Works shall you do because
[48:41] I go to my father I'm going to make a
[48:44] way where you can impart eternal
[48:49] life but do we believe
[48:53] that but of course
[48:56] we've got all kind of
[48:59] ideas brother so and so he can impart
[49:01] Eternal I've seen him inart eternal life
[49:03] I seen him
[49:05] my praise God if it worked I'm going to
[49:08] make a
[49:10] statement only those who have the Holy
[49:15] Spirit is the only ones who can in any
[49:19] form impart eternal life amen right
[49:24] amen so all the other imparting
[49:29] is right
[49:33] right of course the Catholic you walk up
[49:35] to him and you pay a little in the pot
[49:37] especially over here you know and he
[49:39] comes up and he he just does away all of
[49:42] your sins and he turns you back and he
[49:44] sends you away and and he sprinkles sh
[49:46] on you whatever he does and he sends you
[49:48] back and and you go back and and you're
[49:50] perfectly totally set free from your
[49:52] sins even until women their virginity is
[49:57] restored and they can go and
[50:04] marry some sitting here you want to let
[50:06] them explain
[50:09] it I don't think that works do
[50:14] you I think you got to
[50:19] understand how to do the Greater Works
[50:21] amen that's right and the first thing to
[50:24] understand is it cannot be done unless
[50:28] you are born
[50:30] again unless you have the same spirit
[50:33] that Jesus Christ
[50:35] had in
[50:41] you right that's right now why can't we
[50:44] believe that the Jes that the ministry
[50:46] of Jesus is
[50:47] here I'm going to keep going back to it
[50:49] you're going to get mad at me after a
[50:51] while because I'm going to keep laying
[50:52] it back to
[50:54] it them denominations them people out
[50:57] there they're casting out Devils they're
[50:59] Healing The Sick they're raising the
[51:02] dead and they claim to impart eternal
[51:12] life you mean they can do what we can't
[51:17] do all right if you're saying that then
[51:19] I'm asking a question
[51:23] why why
[51:26] then I'll give you the answer cuz they
[51:28] believe it's for them and it works and
[51:32] we don't believe it in the way we need
[51:35] to believe
[51:39] it we believe what we want to believe
[51:43] yeah well I tell you what like I said
[51:46] you know we start off in the people the
[51:47] message they're real good I just don't
[51:49] see nothing going on I don't I just
[51:51] don't see nobody that could impart
[51:52] eternal
[51:54] life
[51:56] well the disciples was told
[51:59] that
[52:02] right did the disciples impart eternal
[52:06] life one man with one message imparted
[52:09] eternal life to 3,000
[52:12] Souls
[52:15] y right right
[52:19] amen but yet we don't see the ministry
[52:21] of Jesus
[52:24] Christ I just don't see the ministry of
[52:26] Jesus
[52:27] Christ well because you got it figured
[52:29] out a certain way that got to be the
[52:30] ministry or you won't accept
[52:36] it I'm laying it down to the point that
[52:38] I'm telling you up to your face in front
[52:40] and on the tapes and everywh you can't
[52:41] deny it so you need to listen then
[52:45] instead of figuring it all out listen to
[52:47] what's being
[52:51] said because you can't argue with what I
[52:53] just said
[52:56] Willers don't believe that's what I mean
[52:58] you don't believe it but there's no way
[53:01] to argue you can't argue that them
[53:04] denominations out
[53:06] there are not casting out Devils Healing
[53:09] The Sick raising the Dead all kind of
[53:11] signs and wonders you can't deny that if
[53:13] you do you're
[53:16] stupid you ain't even got enough sense
[53:18] to come in out of the
[53:19] rain and if you think the disciples
[53:22] didn't have the ministry of Jesus Christ
[53:23] you really are stupid sorry for the
[53:28] language but I'm tired of
[53:32] playing cuz listen if this thing don't
[53:36] something don't happen you going to find
[53:38] you another pastor and it ain't going to
[53:40] be
[53:42] long I've done made up my mind it's got
[53:46] to work or it ain't if it's not working
[53:48] it's my
[53:50] fault no sir no I can take care of that
[53:57] you say you just trying to scare don't
[53:59] think this brother ever going to try to
[54:01] scare you I'm trying to save
[54:08] you ain't trying to scare you amen
[54:11] trying to tell you the truth but you
[54:13] won't
[54:16] listen you can't argue they're doing the
[54:19] signs and
[54:20] wonders you can't
[54:23] argue that Jesus gave him the
[54:26] ministry who gave it to them that's
[54:31] right ain't no devil can give it no no
[54:39] right we see we don't think about well
[54:42] the ministry of Jesus Christ but I just
[54:44] want to see this I want to see
[54:47] this what about it look what he says on
[54:51] that day on
[54:53] Calvary and and notice the Greater Works
[54:56] was to have the power in the church not
[54:59] only to heal the Sick by prayer cast out
[55:02] Devils by prayer but to impart eternal
[55:05] life to Believers now you're not going
[55:08] to impart eternal life to unbelievers
[55:11] right okay solves the
[55:16] problem all
[55:18] right look the Holy Ghost was coming and
[55:21] giv into the hands of the church to
[55:24] impart life
[55:25] oh that's what Calvary meant so where
[55:28] did it come back
[55:31] there so part of Jesus's Ministry is now
[55:34] stepped up into another stage if you're
[55:40] listening look what it
[55:42] done it took St degraded men and women
[55:46] and lifted them into a place to be Sons
[55:48] and Daughters of God to heal the sick to
[55:51] impart eternal life how by giving the
[55:55] Holy Ghost to obedient
[55:57] Believers now how can you give the Holy
[56:00] Ghost to anybody we're going to get down
[56:02] into the scriptures because that's what
[56:04] I know your
[56:05] minds cuz I made the statement there was
[56:08] no giving of the disciples to lay hands
[56:12] on to receive the Holy Ghost see you
[56:14] took that and split it it's in the Bible
[56:17] if you lay hands
[56:20] on for receiving the Holy Ghost that's
[56:22] right it's in the book of Acts
[56:27] okay but can you give it to anybody you
[56:30] want
[56:31] to well it says lay hand WR I'll remind
[56:36] you that the man Simeon orever how you
[56:38] pronounce his name he wanted the
[56:43] gift right offered to pay money for the
[56:46] gift of being able to lay hands on who
[56:49] he laid hands on and for them to receive
[56:51] the Holy Ghost and what did they tell
[56:53] them you don't know what you are you
[56:57] have no part with this why cuz he
[57:00] thought it would be something he'd be
[57:01] able to
[57:05] do I'm going to make another statement
[57:07] so
[57:09] listen just laying on your hands is not
[57:11] going to give the Holy Ghost you got to
[57:14] have the person in line you know what I
[57:16] mean you got to get him in line with the
[57:18] rest of the scripture because that's
[57:19] what we're going to read in here you get
[57:22] him in line with the rest of the
[57:23] scripture that he repents and follows
[57:25] the Lord and baptism then you can lay
[57:27] hands on
[57:29] him because remember they were laying
[57:32] hands on him down there and praying for
[57:33] them in the book of Acts and they
[57:35] couldn't get the Holy Ghost come on they
[57:36] sent for Peter or one other of them they
[57:38] came down laid hands on the Holy Ghost
[57:39] came was it the
[57:46] hands see you can't just lay hands on
[57:49] people and him receive the Holy
[57:52] Ghost what you do pray for people to
[57:54] rece see the Holy Ghost and you lay
[57:56] hands on them while you praying for
[57:59] him but remember car them through the
[58:01] stages that's right
[58:04] look by giving the Holy Ghost to
[58:07] obedient Believers you can't give it to
[58:08] anybody
[58:09] else and impart spiritual eternal
[58:13] life how much greater is it to say to
[58:16] the sick woman laying here I can pray a
[58:19] prayer of faith and she'll be healed
[58:21] that's a great thing that's what he was
[58:23] doing then but said greater than this
[58:26] shall you do I'm going to give you
[58:30] power not only to raise him up for a
[58:34] while see rais the dead right but to
[58:37] give him eternal
[58:40] life which will be Eternal
[58:46] forever well I just don't believe we can
[58:48] give eternal
[58:49] life then you're not believing according
[58:51] to the scripture right
[58:55] and see one of these days you'll realize
[58:57] what I've been preaching for 50
[59:00] years eternal life to them that will
[59:05] believe
[59:09] it eternal
[59:11] life well brother D I just can't believe
[59:13] you cuz you got so many problems well
[59:15] then why don't you go find somebody else
[59:17] that don't have some and that'll take
[59:19] care of it and I'll give you some money
[59:21] to
[59:22] go right never had no
[59:26] problems poor blind wretched people how
[59:29] do you miss that don't you see what the
[59:31] greater thing is that's the greater
[59:34] thing that could ever happen was to
[59:37] impart eternal life to people the
[59:39] greatest thing Could
[59:43] Happen what is eternal life the life
[59:46] that he lived the life that was in him
[59:49] impart that to others can a man do that
[59:53] a Son of God can
[59:56] so it's not for just everybody it's only
[59:59] a Son of God that's
[1:00:01] right now may I say this what are you
[1:00:04] going to do you're a
[1:00:06] pastor and the man comes
[1:00:08] up and he says brother Dale I want you
[1:00:11] to pray for me to receive eternal
[1:00:16] life but yet I know he's living like the
[1:00:23] devil that's
[1:00:25] right now brother brandham
[1:00:28] said in other words if you know there's
[1:00:30] a problem and you pray it
[1:00:33] off he said you'll get yourself in
[1:00:36] trouble with
[1:00:38] God right so it's not just anybody and
[1:00:41] hophazardly lay hands on and H no
[1:00:46] no but the reason it ain't working is
[1:00:49] because the people are not
[1:00:52] listening what is eternal life the life
[1:00:55] that he lived the life that was in him
[1:00:57] impart that to others can a man do that
[1:00:59] a Son of God Can Jesus said whosoever
[1:01:01] sins you remit to them they are remitted
[1:01:04] whosoever sins you retain to them they
[1:01:06] are retained now here's where the
[1:01:08] Catholic church and many of the others
[1:01:10] made their big mistake they go out and
[1:01:12] say I forgive your
[1:01:14] sins that wasn't
[1:01:17] it now can I go back up in here and pick
[1:01:20] up that he's talking about imparting
[1:01:21] eternal life he's talking about
[1:01:23] forgiving sins that's the same thing are
[1:01:26] you with me he's talking about in paron
[1:01:28] what is eternal life in pardoning
[1:01:29] eternal life now ain't talking about
[1:01:31] sins forgiven don't be silly and say oh
[1:01:34] that's your sin's
[1:01:37] forgiven the greatest sin to be forgiven
[1:01:40] is the sin of
[1:01:42] unbelief to where that God can give you
[1:01:45] eternal life
[1:01:48] look they go out and say I forgive your
[1:01:51] sins that wasn't it how did they get
[1:01:54] sins forgiven in the
[1:01:59] Bible Well we go over here and we pick
[1:02:01] this up lay hands on the sick and they
[1:02:03] go here and say lay hands on and they
[1:02:04] get the Holy
[1:02:06] Ghost now you got a
[1:02:10] problem you got scripture but you're
[1:02:13] misusing
[1:02:17] it what you're saying is right but to
[1:02:20] misuse
[1:02:23] it we're going to follow the ministry of
[1:02:25] Jesus Christ or we're going to forget it
[1:02:27] how did they get sins forgiven in the
[1:02:28] Bible Peter answered that question on
[1:02:31] the day of Pentecost they said what can
[1:02:33] we do to be saved what can we do to have
[1:02:37] eternal life imparted unto us right
[1:02:41] right amen how can we get this that you
[1:02:44] all
[1:02:45] got like that he laid down the
[1:02:48] prescription he told them what to do he
[1:02:50] said repent every one of you towards God
[1:02:53] and be baptized in in the name of Jesus
[1:02:55] Christ what for the remission of your
[1:02:57] sins there's the Greater
[1:03:00] Works right now we done been through the
[1:03:04] point that water baptism does not
[1:03:07] forgive your sins that's right but the
[1:03:10] scripture
[1:03:12] says it also says he that believeth in
[1:03:15] is baptized shall be saved so now we got
[1:03:18] to get it all together or forget
[1:03:21] it what a baptism don't won't save you
[1:03:25] it's an answer of a good
[1:03:27] conscience all right they received it at
[1:03:31] K's house before they were
[1:03:33] baptized right but tell me they didn't
[1:03:36] go get baptized now I'm going to tell
[1:03:39] you you you don't even understand the
[1:03:41] story but are you
[1:03:44] listening I know I ain't getting down to
[1:03:46] where I want to but that's all
[1:03:50] right what does he say to
[1:03:53] do he's talking about going there and
[1:03:56] preaching the
[1:03:59] gospel and the gospel is what to set us
[1:04:03] free the prescription is laid down
[1:04:05] repent everyone and be baptized name of
[1:04:07] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[1:04:09] and you shall receive eternal life
[1:04:11] because the ones that were saying that
[1:04:14] were already doing now I I'm like
[1:04:19] this
[1:04:22] uh say me and brother collie
[1:04:24] you know we both find out the
[1:04:27] truth well that's all right he baptized
[1:04:29] me and I baptized him I think that's
[1:04:32] okay right I think that's okay but if I
[1:04:35] say brother collie would you baptize me
[1:04:36] and he said yeah I'll baptize and I say
[1:04:38] when I want to baptize I think you he
[1:04:39] said I ain't going to do
[1:04:42] it I'm going to go get me somebody else
[1:04:44] to baptize me because he didn't do it
[1:04:46] right even though he done it in the name
[1:04:49] of the Lord Jesus Christ because he done
[1:04:52] it in a deceiving manner that he was is
[1:04:54] not going to do what I
[1:04:56] done you're getting the point I don't
[1:04:58] want somebody baptizing me they already
[1:05:00] been
[1:05:00] baptized unless is a a this an account
[1:05:04] happens that where the two would wind up
[1:05:06] and you
[1:05:08] know
[1:05:11] right do you
[1:05:15] understand we could go into a lot of
[1:05:17] things but that's
[1:05:19] okay
[1:05:21] listen what does your Prophet say
[1:05:26] go ahead to number
[1:05:28] three let's get these points of EX what
[1:05:31] Jesus done and get that out of the
[1:05:34] way John 3 John 7
[1:05:37] 3839 out of the belly shall flow rivers
[1:05:40] of Living Water but this spake he of the
[1:05:42] spirit which they that believe on him
[1:05:44] should receive for the Holy Ghost was
[1:05:46] not yet given because Jesus was not yet
[1:05:51] glorified all right now go to number
[1:05:53] four
[1:05:55] which is a revelation of Jesus
[1:05:58] Christ preach 1960 paragraph 149 he that
[1:06:01] believeth on me St John 14:7 he that
[1:06:04] believeth in me the works that I do
[1:06:06] shall he do shall he also do the same
[1:06:09] works and greater than this because
[1:06:12] Christ could not preach the baptism of
[1:06:15] the Holy
[1:06:17] Ghost so you know for certain if Christ
[1:06:20] couldn't preach it the disciples
[1:06:22] couldn't right
[1:06:24] right
[1:06:26] why because Christ could not preach the
[1:06:28] baptism of the G would be greater he
[1:06:31] could not bring it to
[1:06:35] them are you reading it he could not
[1:06:38] bring it to
[1:06:39] them what about God Almighty could not
[1:06:43] bring the baptism of the Holy Ghost to
[1:06:46] the disciples right that had followed
[1:06:49] him for three years a half or
[1:06:52] something right
[1:06:56] why Christ could not preach the baptism
[1:06:59] in the ghost would' be greater he could
[1:07:00] not bring it to them because the Holy
[1:07:02] Ghost hadn't yet been given but when
[1:07:05] Jesus came and sacrificed his life and
[1:07:09] the Holy Ghost returned then they could
[1:07:11] impart eternal life to the people that's
[1:07:15] the
[1:07:16] greater we know he can't do anything
[1:07:18] greater we we understand that it means
[1:07:22] more right
[1:07:24] do you need those where the Prophet said
[1:07:26] it means more but then read these where
[1:07:29] he says it's greater to impart eternal
[1:07:34] life you realize he couldn't preach
[1:07:36] eternal
[1:07:38] life that's why he would say the kingdom
[1:07:40] is at
[1:07:44] hand right because it couldn't be done
[1:07:48] all
[1:07:50] right look at the next Jehovah Gyra 196
[1:07:56] 61 greater then you will ask talk about
[1:07:59] the greater and I'll tell you what it
[1:08:02] is so you come do the works he done
[1:08:07] first now what does he mean you come and
[1:08:10] do the works he done first then we'll
[1:08:12] talk about the
[1:08:14] greater what was the works that Jesus
[1:08:21] done he walked the life
[1:08:24] he followed the word to the letter even
[1:08:28] was
[1:08:29] baptized
[1:08:31] right he followed the word to the letter
[1:08:34] amen he lived it to the letter you see
[1:08:38] what your Prophet is
[1:08:39] saying did you say the Greater Works now
[1:08:42] come on I can go through the whole
[1:08:43] message
[1:08:44] right did you say the Greater Works is
[1:08:47] preaching the gospel look how close they
[1:08:51] are the denomination said the Greater
[1:08:54] Works is preaching the gospel look how
[1:08:56] close it it Jesus couldn't
[1:08:58] preach until he was
[1:09:02] crucified right he couldn't preach the
[1:09:04] gospel he couldn't preach the eternal
[1:09:07] life until the life had been given amen
[1:09:10] you see what he's saying people say we
[1:09:13] preach the gospel that's the Greater
[1:09:15] Works he said do the lesser
[1:09:18] works and then we'll talk about the
[1:09:22] greater live a chrisan chrisan Life cast
[1:09:25] out Devils heal their sick raise the
[1:09:28] dead but live a Christian
[1:09:31] Life and then we'll talk about the
[1:09:33] Greater Works that's right of imparting
[1:09:37] eternal life Jesus could not preach the
[1:09:40] baptism with the Holy
[1:09:41] Ghost it hadn't come yet that's the
[1:09:44] Greater Works we're
[1:09:48] doing but to do the same Works he did he
[1:09:52] said you would
[1:09:56] don't you see what the church has been
[1:10:01] given not just a Healing The Sick
[1:10:04] casting out Devils even raising the Dead
[1:10:07] the World Church can do that that's
[1:10:10] right that's
[1:10:12] right but they cannot impart eternal
[1:10:16] life now you're going to
[1:10:19] say Brother D you don't think nobody be
[1:10:21] saved out there I didn't say that
[1:10:24] because brother rown says it
[1:10:26] can he said a dog sitting over a egg
[1:10:30] will hatch the egg that's
[1:10:33] right
[1:10:35] okay what are we trying to do look at
[1:10:38] the next one getting in the spirit I
[1:10:40] read these to you the other week but I
[1:10:42] want to read them again just make
[1:10:46] sure if you think of
[1:10:48] theology is the sign of
[1:10:51] Messiah that's to the people they say
[1:10:54] they're preaching look if you think a
[1:10:58] theology is a sign of
[1:11:01] Messiah and that's a and that's a
[1:11:03] greater sign than
[1:11:07] this Jesus said the works that I do so
[1:11:10] you do also right you say preaching the
[1:11:14] gospel is a greater work all right then
[1:11:17] you come here and do the lesser
[1:11:20] works you see he could stand and say
[1:11:25] things you and I can't say that's right
[1:11:29] but I have been playing on one
[1:11:34] thing I have preached the gospel of
[1:11:42] Salvation and somebody challenges me
[1:11:45] from the
[1:11:48] platform I've been there and walked
[1:11:52] that challeng me from the pull pit I'm
[1:11:56] going and if I don't go you go away from
[1:12:03] me come
[1:12:05] on I didn't say I challenge
[1:12:09] them come on we get the Bible correct
[1:12:12] we'll be right Elijah didn't challenge
[1:12:14] them read your Bible yet you think
[1:12:16] Elijah challenged him and told him to do
[1:12:18] this that the other go back and read R
[1:12:19] around him he said they challenged
[1:12:22] Elijah
[1:12:24] I ain't talking about being stupid I'm
[1:12:27] talking about being the
[1:12:29] truth if somebody challenges you and you
[1:12:33] know you're standing on the truth why
[1:12:35] are you afraid that's right that's right
[1:12:37] sir I'm right here every service on the
[1:12:40] internet
[1:12:42] live and speaking to you what I believe
[1:12:46] amen you think I'm going to back up
[1:12:48] because of
[1:12:49] some silly
[1:12:52] situation
[1:12:55] no I'm going to stand for the truth
[1:12:57] that's right man challenged me well I'll
[1:13:01] put it right he challenged somebody
[1:13:05] else and then somebody else said he
[1:13:07] never did hear the man challenge him I
[1:13:10] got up and walked up there and I said I
[1:13:11] accept your
[1:13:14] challenge you got three
[1:13:16] months I'll meet you anywhere in the
[1:13:18] United States for 3
[1:13:21] months and you preach what you
[1:13:24] believe but I said I want one
[1:13:27] service to preach the
[1:13:29] truth thank you
[1:13:33] Lord the man never said no
[1:13:39] more you see I don't care who it
[1:13:45] is why can't we stand for what we
[1:13:49] believe well that's a brother I didn't
[1:13:52] challenge he challenge Cheng
[1:13:56] me I didn't get a ver I challenge all of
[1:13:59] you no uhuh no I ain't going to do
[1:14:03] it but if you got something in your
[1:14:05] heart why are you afraid of
[1:14:07] it
[1:14:09] right
[1:14:11] okay come here and do the lesser here's
[1:14:14] a platform he said help yourself come
[1:14:16] here and go down through this prayer
[1:14:18] line and let the Holy Spirit move in and
[1:14:20] out of the audience there over you let
[1:14:23] me see you do them works and then go
[1:14:26] preach the gospel then you do do a
[1:14:29] Greater Works Jesus could not preach the
[1:14:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost because it had
[1:14:35] not yet not yet come that's a Greater
[1:14:39] Works it certainly is the church is to
[1:14:41] preach the baptism of the Holy
[1:14:45] Spirit Jesus said it was coming but the
[1:14:49] church has it and saying we got it and
[1:14:53] it's for you and see that was a
[1:14:57] greater that is
[1:14:59] true when are we going to stand up for
[1:15:01] what we
[1:15:07] believe what's the
[1:15:10] matter maybe we don't believe what we
[1:15:12] got is
[1:15:13] enough all right go to the next one
[1:15:16] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:15:18] and
[1:15:19] forever the things that I do shall you
[1:15:22] also More Than This shall you do for I
[1:15:24] go to my father is that right the word
[1:15:27] Dar in the King James mean is greater
[1:15:29] but a righty translation is more because
[1:15:32] you couldn't do greater he he raised the
[1:15:34] dead stopped the nature and done
[1:15:36] everything not greater
[1:15:38] in
[1:15:40] quality but greater in
[1:15:43] quantity why because now there's more
[1:15:47] Jesus is right there's more Christ right
[1:15:50] More Than This shall you do for I go to
[1:15:52] my father amen and I'm late said did the
[1:15:55] disciples do
[1:15:58] it now he's answering it right did the
[1:16:01] disciples do what Jesus
[1:16:06] said watch
[1:16:08] him did the disciples do it the same
[1:16:11] Ministry that Jesus Christ
[1:16:14] had the apostles carried on just exactly
[1:16:19] like they always did the
[1:16:24] apostles going down through and all in
[1:16:26] their rest and everything he said the
[1:16:28] disciples done
[1:16:32] it
[1:16:36] now then are we going to admit that the
[1:16:41] disciples done the Greater
[1:16:44] Works he said they did said it was the
[1:16:47] ministry of Jesus
[1:16:52] Christ
[1:16:55] see we can we can agree with that I'll
[1:16:58] take another minute or two and quit we
[1:17:01] can agree with their
[1:17:04] disciples we can look
[1:17:06] back right and we can
[1:17:09] say Peter and John said Silver and Gold
[1:17:12] Have I None but in the name of Jesus
[1:17:13] Christ I believe
[1:17:15] that they' done the Greater Works they
[1:17:17] preach the gospel they healed the sick
[1:17:19] they cast out
[1:17:20] Devils they raised the Dead they've done
[1:17:23] the great
[1:17:24] things but are we like the Church of
[1:17:26] Christ now I'm throwing off on them but
[1:17:29] the point they're the one that makes the
[1:17:31] statement they said only the
[1:17:34] 12 had the gifts of the Holy
[1:17:38] Ghost that's their
[1:17:40] Doctrine so we're not supposed to have
[1:17:42] nothing we just sit L waiting on the
[1:17:46] bus what did the brother R say he said
[1:17:52] Paul would be one more that you'd have
[1:17:54] to deal with and said look at the life
[1:17:56] of Paul and the
[1:17:58] Ministries and said look at him said the
[1:18:01] Holy Ghost was being ordained in the
[1:18:03] church and gifts and things 30 40 years
[1:18:06] after the Lord Jesus was
[1:18:09] crucified but are
[1:18:11] we of that
[1:18:13] caliber we don't see
[1:18:16] it now how many times have you heard me
[1:18:19] say this do you realize when you say you
[1:18:22] don't see it
[1:18:23] right you have shut your mind off from
[1:18:27] the
[1:18:32] truth you say I don't see it among the
[1:18:35] bride
[1:18:36] today you're going to say you don't see
[1:18:38] it out there in them other churches when
[1:18:41] they sick healed and revivals going on
[1:18:44] around the world and all kind of things
[1:18:48] happening look what you're
[1:18:51] doing when you say you don't don't see
[1:18:56] it you're saying it's not
[1:19:01] here at least you could say as far as I
[1:19:05] believe I don't see it and give you a
[1:19:08] little category of looseness
[1:19:11] right
[1:19:14] okay but we would all at least
[1:19:19] agree that the apostles at the ministry
[1:19:22] of Jesus Christ could we make that a
[1:19:26] statement I'll read a couple of more and
[1:19:28] then we'll quit and then pick it back up
[1:19:31] later would we at least agree that the
[1:19:34] apostles had the ministry of Jesus
[1:19:37] Christ
[1:19:39] amen they even had it before his
[1:19:44] crucifixion but they had it Greater
[1:19:46] after his crucifixion that's that's
[1:19:48] right
[1:19:51] amen
[1:19:55] okay you agree there but let's see if
[1:19:58] you agree with
[1:19:59] this what was it
[1:20:07] number same Ministry Jesus Christ had
[1:20:09] the apostles carried on we picked that
[1:20:12] one up we've done picked up the part of

[1:20:35] their Ministry stop right there he said

[1:20:40] way of the Gentiles into any city of the
[1:20:43] Samaritan enter you not now what Jesus

[1:21:01] he gave
[1:21:03] them who he talking about the
[1:21:06] disciples this ministry that he gave
[1:21:09] them was exactly the sharing of his own
[1:21:12] Ministry with them for it says that in
[1:21:15] Matthew 9 35 and 38 so Jesus said went
[1:21:18] into the second o
[1:21:21] preaching you believe that this ministry

[1:21:27] nine try to get in a hurry confirmation
[1:21:30] of the
[1:21:32] commission all right roll it on up go to
[1:21:35] paragraph next
[1:21:37] paragraph save time reading now that
[1:21:40] same Holy Spirit we find it now he's
[1:21:44] just giving you the Holy Spirit iner
[1:21:46] disciples okay will you take my word
[1:21:48] without having to roll it back down and
[1:21:49] reread it that he's talking about the
[1:21:52] ministry to to the disciples and he says
[1:21:54] in that same holy spirit that we find it
[1:21:57] right amongst the Pentecostal
[1:22:00] people cuz see everybody wants to jump
[1:22:03] now here's that back and here's coming
[1:22:05] up forward in a point because everybody
[1:22:07] looked back at the apostles and then
[1:22:08] they look at brother
[1:22:10] bradam right and they say brother Bram
[1:22:13] had all these Ministry
[1:22:15] amen but is he the only one to have
[1:22:21] it
[1:22:23] come on don't worry about it we're going
[1:22:24] on over to The Headstone don't you worry
[1:22:26] about it a't none of us going to be able
[1:22:27] to bring anything that's why I ask you
[1:22:30] to read Zechariah because it's
[1:22:34] zable that will bring forth The
[1:22:37] Headstone amen not lay a
[1:22:41] Cornerstone read your
[1:22:43] Bible we'll get to
[1:22:45] there after all these brothers get
[1:22:47] through preaching so I'll give you a
[1:22:48] little time to think it over look now
[1:22:51] that same Holy Spirit we find it right
[1:22:53] amongst the Pentecostal people today the
[1:22:56] evening light right down amongst the
[1:22:58] Pentecostal people what preaching the
[1:23:01] same gospel giving Vindication of the
[1:23:03] same gospel the same signs that followed
[1:23:06] there is the same signs that follow now
[1:23:11] and if that Pillar of Fire or light that
[1:23:13] we have with us did not produce The Same
[1:23:15] Spirit and the same evidence that it did
[1:23:18] when it was in Jesus Christ then it
[1:23:20] would be the wrong Pillar of Fire the
[1:23:22] wrong Spirit be the wrong thing but if
[1:23:25] it does produce and do just exactly what
[1:23:28] Jesus done then he said to he that
[1:23:31] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:23:33] shall he do also you ever heard brother
[1:23:35] random talk like this about uh he prayed
[1:23:39] for a man for his nose to be restored
[1:23:41] took a little time FF bosford prayed and
[1:23:44] it was immediately
[1:23:47] restored see we think brother random he
[1:23:50] jumped from the disciples and into
[1:23:51] brother random and and that's
[1:23:54] it he said it's among the Pentecostals
[1:23:57] the ministry of Jesus Christ today is
[1:23:59] among the
[1:24:03] Pentecostals yeah but they don't preach
[1:24:04] the word we ain't talking about that we
[1:24:07] ain't got to that part yet we're talking
[1:24:10] about the signs and the
[1:24:14] wonders because if he's Hebrews 13:8
[1:24:17] then whatever he done back there he's
[1:24:19] got to keep on doing that's right that's
[1:24:22] right right okay let's go to the next

[1:26:40] Spirit same kind of works that Jesus did
[1:26:43] here on Earth the church has to do the
[1:26:45] same thing if it's not it's not the seat
[1:26:48] of Abraham it's not the Church of Jesus
[1:26:51] Christ

[1:27:06] don't worry about it it'll be light
[1:27:08] evening
[1:27:09] time the holy spirit's here with the
[1:27:12] same Ministry that was delivered to the
[1:27:16] Lord he stopped what by the Lord Jesus
[1:27:19] Christ to his
[1:27:21] apostles
[1:27:23] and she's coming through a
[1:27:27] Darkness but the clouds are clearing
[1:27:30] back the same Holy Spirit has come and
[1:27:33] revealing the same thing God bless
[1:27:37] you think about
[1:27:43] it I'm going to just quit right there
[1:27:48] because I just want to make a few
[1:27:51] statements
[1:27:55] do we believe the ministry of Jesus
[1:27:57] Christ is here
[1:28:00] tonight
[1:28:02] Amen Brother Gary Atkins asked me that
[1:28:05] years ago he said brother Dale do you
[1:28:07] think we have the faith of the fathers I
[1:28:09] said not everybody know but for me to
[1:28:11] say that somebody doesn't have it I
[1:28:14] believe I would be derogatory to the
[1:28:16] point you know I would be wrong because
[1:28:18] I believe some of the Bride of Jesus
[1:28:21] Christ has the Ministry exactly like the
[1:28:23] apostles had
[1:28:25] right then he asked me he said Do you
[1:28:28] believe we have the headstone
[1:28:33] exactly I said if you had to put that
[1:28:35] exactly on there we could talk better
[1:28:37] but now you're saying
[1:28:40] exactly and I said my answer is the holy
[1:28:45] spirit is The
[1:28:47] Headstone and it's
[1:28:49] here and it has been here all alone
[1:28:52] right and it's coming down to cap off
[1:28:54] the
[1:28:56] church and I believe some
[1:29:00] ministers at least are catching on to be
[1:29:02] able to
[1:29:03] preach and I said some Ley are catching
[1:29:06] on to be able to believe it and I said
[1:29:10] then the Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:29:13] here around the world not to be in one
[1:29:17] man it's not to come in one man anymore
[1:29:20] it was in brother Bram it was in the
[1:29:22] Lord Jesus but he made way in the Lord
[1:29:24] Jesus to
[1:29:25] come to all mankind the only thing you
[1:29:29] have with brother Bram is a man standing
[1:29:32] showing the ministry is restored right
[1:29:36] right because he couldn't be
[1:29:39] it he said that's where you messing up
[1:29:41] he said the seventh angel is not the son
[1:29:44] of
[1:29:48] man see he's a son of man introducing
[1:29:51] the son of man
[1:29:52] man
[1:29:54] amen now folks when are we going to
[1:29:56] finally
[1:29:59] believe in 1969 in Athens Georgia the
[1:30:03] first sermon I
[1:30:04] preached in this
[1:30:06] message I taught Sunday school and all
[1:30:09] kind of
[1:30:11] thing but the first message I
[1:30:13] preached was the Bride of Jesus
[1:30:18] Christ 1969 would be the son of
[1:30:22] man in the last days the word made flesh
[1:30:27] I proved it by the prophet if You' like
[1:30:29] them they're written in the front of my
[1:30:30] Bible and that was just a quotes that I
[1:30:33] had in
[1:30:35] 69 brother brownon said the bride would
[1:30:37] be the fullest or the godhead
[1:30:40] bodily he said the godhead is not
[1:30:42] complete without
[1:30:43] you we have a lot of road to go but
[1:30:46] we've covered a lot of Road yes sir
[1:30:49] Brother D do you believe the ministry of
[1:30:51] Jesus Christ driv it here I
[1:30:54] do at least let me believe it listen at
[1:30:58] least let me believe it I could believe
[1:31:01] that the disciples had it before they
[1:31:03] were born again at least let me believe
[1:31:08] that you don't have to
[1:31:11] agree but you know they had
[1:31:15] it and you know they had the ministry of
[1:31:18] Jesus
[1:31:19] Christ after the Holy Ghost came and
[1:31:22] could do the Greater
[1:31:24] Works by imparting eternal life through
[1:31:28] the preaching of the Gospel that's why
[1:31:30] there ain't never been a person in the
[1:31:32] Bible that was ever born again that did
[1:31:34] not first hear the word proclaimed unto
[1:31:38] them because it's impossible to be born
[1:31:41] again without the word coming because
[1:31:44] the new birth is the birth of the
[1:31:49] word do you believe that the ministry of
[1:31:52] Jesus Christ is
[1:31:54] here that the faith of the fathers is
[1:32:01] here what is the faith of the fathers I
[1:32:04] thought we believ it was the revelation
[1:32:06] of the fathers I didn't know it was a
[1:32:08] super duper out of this or out of the
[1:32:10] other that's what we're looking at faith
[1:32:12] faith is a revelation right how many
[1:32:15] gods do you believe in
[1:32:17] tonight one how many did disciples
[1:32:21] believe in right that's
[1:32:24] right do you believe hell is eternal
[1:32:27] no the disciples didn't believe it's
[1:32:30] Eternal that's
[1:32:32] right how long could we stand and talk
[1:32:35] about
[1:32:40] it where are we at in the
[1:32:45] stages of the ministry of Jesus
[1:32:50] Christ
[1:32:52] because whatever we believe we are
[1:32:54] that's where God will hold us
[1:33:03] accountable the ministry of Jesus
[1:33:06] Christ in different
[1:33:10] stages just like the ministry of Elijah
[1:33:13] was in five different stages
[1:33:17] right AR we'll be when it's finished
[1:33:20] right
[1:33:23] what do you think about
[1:33:26] it well I just don't
[1:33:29] see you want to say
[1:33:33] it wake up
[1:33:35] church I'm going to make this one more
[1:33:38] statement that I've made many
[1:33:40] times brother randam said that there was
[1:33:44] more in one
[1:33:47] service in his
[1:33:49] ministry then in the end entire I
[1:33:52] believe he said book of Acts I know he
[1:33:54] said it that way but he may have said in
[1:33:56] the whole Bible I know he said in
[1:34:00] the the book of Acts listed I've asked
[1:34:03] you to go home read the book of
[1:34:07] Acts and write down every miracle that
[1:34:11] happened and write down that that was
[1:34:13] over a period of
[1:34:16] some to going to 53 for Paul to start
[1:34:20] the first church age you at least got
[1:34:21] into the neighborhood of 20
[1:34:23] years and in 20 years they had these how
[1:34:27] many miracles did they have come on
[1:34:29] folks now don't don't play with me and I
[1:34:30] won't with you I know the Bible and what
[1:34:33] it says he said the things that was
[1:34:35] written in the world wouldn't be able to
[1:34:36] contain I know that so don't go wrong
[1:34:38] I'm saying what's written
[1:34:40] down we've seen more in this little
[1:34:42] church over 20 years of the accounts of
[1:34:47] happening than what is written in the
[1:34:49] amount of happening as the book book of
[1:34:53] Acts but yet we don't believe anything's
[1:34:55] going
[1:34:57] on you know why it's not going on
[1:35:00] because you don't believe
[1:35:05] it and see the reason you don't believe
[1:35:07] it you say if it happened to me I'd
[1:35:09] believe
[1:35:13] it we've seen the dead
[1:35:15] raised we've seen the sick healed of the
[1:35:18] word amen we've seen rain come
[1:35:22] we've seen Rain
[1:35:23] Go we've seen miracles happen with this
[1:35:27] little group of people right y
[1:35:32] amen but we can go right over there in
[1:35:35] that church and find Miracles happening
[1:35:39] also I don't deny that I preach
[1:35:43] that because that's why your Prophet
[1:35:45] said it he said the third pool and I
[1:35:48] thought he said the third pool was the
[1:35:50] opening of the word I thought that's
[1:35:52] what he said it
[1:35:56] was and what did he
[1:35:58] say he said the third pool is for the
[1:36:02] bride and the
[1:36:05] church you mean it's for them out there
[1:36:08] if they'll accept it it's sure it's
[1:36:10] happening because it's here why is it
[1:36:13] happening out
[1:36:14] there because it's in the bride around
[1:36:17] the world
[1:36:20] Amen me
[1:36:23] virals that never went
[1:36:28] out things that are
[1:36:31] happening we were having a meeting here
[1:36:33] one
[1:36:35] night and we didn't know a lot of people
[1:36:37] was
[1:36:39] coming and you remember
[1:36:42] this they came to me and they said we
[1:36:44] ain't going to have enough
[1:36:47] food I should set it before the people
[1:36:49] there'll be enough
[1:36:55] there was plenty
[1:36:58] enough what else you want to talk
[1:37:07] about how many miracles and signs and
[1:37:09] wonders can we talk
[1:37:11] about and listen folks I want to see
[1:37:15] more and more and I believe we
[1:37:19] will but I thought your prophet
[1:37:21] said that when the squeeze comes then
[1:37:25] the third pull will come into operation
[1:37:27] that's right
[1:37:30] right paraphrase but it's Clos
[1:37:35] right what about it do you believe the
[1:37:38] ministry of Jesus Christ is here now
[1:37:40] listen not saying the ministry is here
[1:37:42] in brother Dale cuz that will not do you
[1:37:45] no good other than help for you if you
[1:37:48] really believe
[1:37:50] it
[1:37:52] I'm talking about inside of you it's got
[1:37:54] to be in you it can't be in one man
[1:37:56] that's done been off the scene and he's
[1:37:58] in the ground waiting on you and I
[1:38:00] that's right yes sir
[1:38:04] amen thank you Jesus but us just talking
[1:38:08] about it ain't going to do no
[1:38:10] good the devil ain't wouldn't mad at
[1:38:12] Martin Luther when he preached to just
[1:38:14] shall live by faith but when the people
[1:38:18] begin to believe
[1:38:19] it he got upset right that's right the
[1:38:25] world is happy to talk about the things
[1:38:28] brother randam
[1:38:30] said of how the world is going and the
[1:38:33] White House and the people and the
[1:38:36] thing but they don't want to hear his
[1:38:41] message
[1:38:43] right what about
[1:38:46] it the same Ministry of Jesus but in
[1:38:50] different stat
[1:38:52] ages it's going to be in the bride of
[1:38:54] Christ around the world and is now
[1:38:58] taking
[1:38:59] place if she'll just believe it
[1:39:03] amen come on
[1:39:07] musicians listen
[1:39:11] Church life is getting
[1:39:20] short but you and I have got to believe
[1:39:22] the
[1:39:25] word somebody
[1:39:27] has well not
[1:39:35] us
[1:39:37] right I had a lot in my notes s we'll
[1:39:40] get to it back later you know that
[1:39:43] brother brandham says if you will not
[1:39:47] confess what God says he cannot do
[1:39:52] it
[1:39:58] right
[1:40:01] on he can't save you if you won't
[1:40:04] confess it that's right he can't heal
[1:40:07] you if you won't confess it well when I
[1:40:10] get healed I'll believe it I'll confess
[1:40:12] it then no you won't cuz you'll never
[1:40:14] get
[1:40:16] it let's
[1:40:19] stand think on these things
[1:40:26] things see Church we're in the last
[1:40:30] days there's no need of playing
[1:40:35] around it's either Believe it or forget
[1:40:40] it if we believe it let's put our life
[1:40:42] on
[1:40:49] it when are we going to believe
[1:40:53] [Music]
[1:40:54] it at least be as brother random had to
[1:40:57] say the last thing I'll
[1:40:59] say he said Lord if I can't produce
[1:41:03] it he said don't let me stand in the
[1:41:06] way somebody that can you know what that
[1:41:12] means that means Brother Ray comes up
[1:41:15] and tells me brother Dale I believe so
[1:41:17] and so and so I said yeah but I don't
[1:41:18] believe it I'm standing in the
[1:41:26] way why wouldn't I say I believe it if
[1:41:29] it's according to the
[1:41:36] word I know of a guy one time that said
[1:41:39] God told him he was going to get a
[1:41:41] albino
[1:41:43] groundhog I said praise God we're going
[1:41:45] to see an albow no
[1:41:48] groundhog well you doubting it no I just
[1:41:50] saying if Lord told him that that's what
[1:41:53] we're going to say

[1:43:36] that the
[1:43:39] bird
