sunday albeit brother dutch scott she'll pray for them and also yeah yep make sure we get this chart out here and this one this one if you don't have it that's okay we're gonna we're just gonna kind of refresh your men because y'all like me we get off on something else and then you forget [Music] kind of what's going on so we're gonna kind of review this sunday ryan's gonna take next sunday and then the next sunday we're gonna bring in uh we haven't brought in a lot of quotes from the prophet so we're going to bring in a lot of quotes two weeks from now and try to put the quotes into it all not try we're going to put the quote what we're talking about and then probably the next sunday just you know throw it all in on the last part that we're talking about and give you some dates to chew on and sometimes that you want and some things that you want and then we'll move along but i want you to between now and two weeks you got two weeks two sundays to write down any questions you have about what we've been studying them so far in 70 weeks a day any question doesn't matter how small or how large please jot them down and we'll try to answer them because sometimes you have questions and and they might get explained later on but if you need to have the answer now you need to have the answer now the question's in your mind you're going to continue to carry that question until something comes along and answers it for you so if you have any questions write them down and we'll see if we can cover them but today we're going to go to daniel 9 24 we're going to read this all right and then we're going to go over and read daniel 12 or maybe even 11 and 12 we're just going to read it and make a few comments on it because i want to put that seed in your mind so that you can chew on it for a couple weeks 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon the holy city the jews in jerusalem all right we're talking about i want you to how many times have i told you this is a two-part this is a two-part meaning here one for the people and one for the city so god has to restore not only people but the city because jerusalem is the holy city now you and i don't have a a con i could our city is not continuing down here remember the bible says we have no continuing seated down here we have one what in glory but it's actually inside of us the gentiles but god promised the jews that they would have a city to go to i don't know what temple to go to all right so whatever has been destroyed what does redemption do redemption brings it back all right yeah 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon the holy city to do six things finish the transgression make an end of sins by reconciliation for iniquity bringing everlasting righteousness seal up the business into prophecy and anoint the most holy now that's got to be done inside of 490 years right correct that's got to be finished that in the city has to be finished in 490 years that's what we're we're trying to get to me that's the bottom line the bible's telling us there's 490 years for the restoration of israel and the city that's exactly what that says and it tells you how all right and this is how know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build jerusalem the old jerusalem unto the messiah the prince should be seven weeks three score in two weeks what 62 plus seven how many times we've been over there six two and seven 69 69 right the streets shall be built again the wall even troubles time so starting at a point we found the point 445 bc when israel began to come back as a nation when israel rebuilt the city tabernacle they rebuilt the walls and brought the people back in all right right remember the 445 bc nehemiah bringing in the edict to come in and restore and then they went all these years until who and to the messiah the prince which is who jesus christ the son of man all right yes and after 62 weeks and after this period right here shall messiah be cut off but not for himself now let's stop right here just for a minute because this is where some people in the message contend that's it that word says after three score in two weeks that means that jesus when he started preaching his strength after your ministry that ended the 62 weeks that's not what the bible said the bible says after three score in two weeks he'll be cut off killed that word cut off if you look it up it means killed he wasn't killed at start of his ministry he was killed at the end of his ministry okay but see to prove their point to get those other to get to three and a half years over here that they say is the 70 is this part right here in the 70 week they have to put it back over here so that says after now i want you to understand something after three score two weeks we'll read it a couple of sundays we'll get back into the quotes but brother brown was so specific he said april the 2nd 80 30 jesus rode into jerusalem on a white donkey palm sunday 80 30. what is palm sunday the sunday before easter okay when was he killed the friday before easter when he rode into jerusalem he was at that moment they said oh hold on to the highest king king three days later they killed him the same people the jews they were the ones that were late i was reading it yesterday in luke they were laying the palm trees down they were saying hosanna to the king you know hosanna hosanna he's come in the name of the lord them same people four days later from sunday monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday afternoon he was dead and they killed him they were jews all right so they cut him off so you know exactly when the 62 weeks was cut off was after april the 9th 1830 after yeah and that was my contestant i said look after me what is tomorrow the day after today only one day it only has to be one day to be after right if you go to walmart tomorrow then what's the next day it's after the day you went so you know they were going after three score in two weeks that there's that he's began his ministry well that's not even the bible the bible said he was cut off killed in april of 80 30. right according to the prophet according to the according our timeline remember we proved it was 80 30. anybody okay with that yeah and after three score in two weeks shall we be cut off absolutely right there he was cut off days after that 62 weeks was over right he was killed that's why i believe brother brown brought the brought the uh do i just common sense yes common sense but see to but look remember revelation is easy when you try when you bring a false doctrine then you've got to bring all the you got to bring all the other things to prove see because their whole contention was buddy i mean stop foot stomping contention was that there's only three and a half years left of the 70 weeks of daniel after the rapture it's not true can't be true according to the bible according to prophet's message cannot be true right right he said it was one week one week left after the rapture the bible shows you there's one week left because if 69 weeks is already finished how many more weeks are we looking for what one week we're not looking for a half week there's no half weeks in the bible except when it says time times and the dividing of time which would be a half half of a week or what three and a half years so after three score in two weeks shall musa be cut off he was killed and the dates up and after 80 april 2nd 80 30 he was he was dead right but not for himself he didn't die for himself he died for me and the people of the prince that say look now you gotta look you gotta pause and the people of the prince that shall come watch where i'm pointing who's the prince that was to come titus little pete the prince that shall come shall destroy the city in 1870 that's when titus came in and utterly there's that's why jesus they told him i was reading that too yesterday where if you're reading in your gospels you read about daniel sandy weeks it's all in the for gospel jesus tells you about the whole thing he said there won't be one stone left you know they took him out that show they said look at these great buildings he said there'll be a time when there won't be one stone left on another well you know what it was okay titus utterly destroyed the temple and there wasn't one stone they couldn't even find the temple where it used to be that's right they just now started to find you know drawings to show them exactly where it was at but as far as seeing the temple titus the prince that shall come what was jesus doing jesus was fulfilling scripture everything he said fulfilled scripture i believe yeah i hope it was because that's what he's talking about he said in in matthew um um jeez my brain just went blank between 24 because he is scripture right matthew 24 he says when you see the abomination that maketh desolate standing in the temple we'll see that's a two-part thing right here it happened one time titus a roman general was standing in the temple okay get away with it and then who put who built on top of it the mosque of omar right so that's the desecration of a temple but remember one thing's for sure that temple is not the problem buildings are not the problem it's the people that go in the buildings or the problem so the the the abomination that makes desolation is not the building it's when the antichrist walks in and says i'm god and this is my building all right all right so the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city titus did in 80 70. and the sanctuary so they tore everything down so now if he tore everything down and 70 weeks is a restoration message let's just call it that 70 weeks is a restoration message he's got to restore the people and the and the temple and the sanctuary and the end there shall be with the flood remember they opened the gates and they said the blood just run out like water and to the end of the war desolations are determined now show me where it's ever come back there's still no temple over there correct it's been 2 000 years and there's still no temple over there okay that's what they're waiting on all right and he that's a period so now that's gonna happen in here we know the messiah was cut off after 62 weeks so what 62.7 again so how much how many years we got to do 70 weeks they're determined so that 69 weeks already happened so there's one week left for the jews to rebuild themselves and the temple you got two things you gotta do right and to me i'll show you where that split is right here that everybody can't see that the people get redeemed the first three and a half years and the city gets redeemed to last three and a half years is that all right right because the city the battle of armageddon's right here they can't build a city and then the battle of armageddon happened and destroy everything that's right that's not a restoration that's why i said everybody in the message says it's all got to happen right there and there's no way there's no way scripture can be fulfilled in that 1260 days right because in the message this is what the people say after the rapture there's only 1260 days left of the 70 weeks of daniel they're about that far from being close to being right there's only 1260 days for the redemption of the people of israel but what about the city what about the city because right here definitely after this is the battle of armageddon now everybody tell you that even even the denominational world will tell you that bible armageddon is going to happen after them two prophets are killed the bible says all heck breaks loose in other words in southern language everything's destroyed well you can't you can't build a temple here and destroy it and then build it again it doesn't say that it's just in 70 weeks the building and the people will be restored that's right so if the 70 weeks ends right here then the bible's wrong and the prophet's wrong so the bible's not wrong the problem's not wrong is that right okay all right so let's keep reading and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week now who's that little age that's the antichrist because god doesn't make a covenant and then break it that's true god makes the covenant of this forever all right so satan confirms the covenant with me for one week right here one week got it one week right now when he makes that covenant we are not here when that covenant's made now the prophet of god tells us many times right we're not here when he makes that covenant with the jew so now if we're not here and that word right there says week one week then there should be one week left after the rapture right yes kind of kind of too simple that's why i said revelation is simple false doctrine it's complicated right because you have to complicate things you have to add this and bring this in and make this fit and make that fit and lord you aren't seeing them still a few lies you're seeing them stinking charts at them i'm telling you they were stinking charts because they were written so much way out of the scripture didn't even take the one the prophet drew kind of sad when you got you know 30 preachers in a building and 25 of them has never seen that chart that brother branham drew of the 70 weeks you know the original chart that he didn't built have a clue had never even seen it knew there was one one circulating but but anyway i don't want to be contentious but i want to tell you i want to be like arenas i don't have nothing to do with them people if they won't take truth i don't have nothing to do with them that's why irena said he's only we caught the same house for the guy yeah right yes remember we were talking about because you know what you hang around false doctrine long enough and it might just get off on you that's true so let's just try to stay up abstain from those things and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week many now remember we talked about this specifically to the jews but it's going to be to the whole world now the bible in what is it timothy where it says peace peace then sudden destruction that's why i want to tell you something about this election coming up let's not be so ignorant about this election coming up what if we get a present because remember and it's got something to do with this or i wouldn't say it but remember we have to be the image to the beast i say we i'm talking about the united states of america now right now we are no military power because of the last president destroyed the military power all right so we have no military might in the world we're laughed at now right right we got to be the image we got to be the image to the beast when he speaks we speak the united states right what said revelation 13. so everybody's thinking now that there's somebody got to come in to make this thing go down no don't think that way the bible says craft will prosper that's right things will prosper right so what about a president that comes in here and builds the economy up gets our war power back up and then what happens in the next three or four years right listen if the stock market's doing like it's doing now just kind of up and down like this that's not a crash right right and you know what if you fall about two feet off of a ledge that's not a crash right but if you fall a hundred feet off of a ledge that's a crash yeah so let's don't think everybody think well hillary we gotta have a woman in the white house all tonight let's watch and see we need somebody in america to build everything back up so trump may not be too far off we need somebody to build this thing back up that final trunk that's right [Laughter] that might be the reason why his last name is jerome but you understand what i'm saying i mean we've got to build our our might has be has got to be built back up i was thinking about this other day the bible even tells us that we as the united states has to be this the brother says the beast is speaking somebody's got to back it up we can't back it up now because we have no military power but the way to get the economy back up is to start a war that's right the war is a very uh war it's very profitable very proud very profitable so so you know let's just think of it as as if trump gets in then he's going to help get what's going on what's going on so but remember you've got to come and build it to a place though that when it does fall then the pope comes in and confirms the covenant with many it'll be the united states and all the people in the u.n will be um affected by this covenant not just the jews okay but that covenant is for one week because it coincides with israel's 1260 days that the two witnesses are going to prophesy according to revelations 11 right okay so a lot and in the midst of the week what's the midst of a week three and a half when the midst of seven is three and a half right and after three and a half years he shall cause the sacrifice of oblation to cease and for the over spreading of abominations he shall make it desolate what is abomination he's going to walk into the temple that they've set up for temple worship and tell them hey i'm gone i'm the one you need to listen to and you know what he will have signs and wonders amen look at janice and jammers when moses came on the scene when these two when these two prophets come on the scene don't you think the devil's going to be silent go hide somewhere no it's going to be them two spirits the same way all the way through they'll do something and somebody else will do something and finally the bible says after 1260 days and in the midst of the week that's when the 1260 days is going to be finished because 1260 is what half of a week three and a half years of prophetic calendar week right just trying to refresh your memory we've been all over this before but sometimes you know we get all these details but let's just kind of push all the dates aside and push all that and just really look at what the bible says and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even until the consummation what does that word consummation mean completion completion of what that's 70 weeks see our completion is right here we get a body change we go on a rapture we're finished you don't have to go to watch on judgment there's no other position that you and i as the bride have to come to pass right here is that right we're done when we take a body change and we go up in another dimension we're finished there's no other redemption for us we don't have to stand at the white throne judgment sure we have to give account of the little things we talked about that in the bible study but as far as anything extra no we're done we're complete now but is israel complete at this point right here no they're actually just getting started okay for their 1260 days they're getting started and here they come to a point till their redemption finish they take a rapture okay but remember what else is left the city the city the temple the tabernacle has got to be completed somewhere because look completion termination full in complete disruption consumption annihilation that's what that word and he shall make it desolate even until the consummation and that determined shall be poured out upon and remember what desolate means stupefy to be desolated deserted to be all struck they're going to be it right here but i see right here is brother brown called the determination of forces that's mankind okay down here mankind see i've always said that here the battle of armageddon is a nuclear disaster right because the bible tells us that man will stand on earth and the flesh will fall off of them that's nuclear fallout right so i don't think that this battle of armageddon is not going to be a one day war might be fast but not one right you can't kill everybody on this face this earth at one time with just atomic bomb they're gonna have to die of other things nuclear fallout they can't eat anything it's gonna be horrible but they are gonna die so there's a little time in there maybe maybe six months maybe whatever but the bible's got to be fulfilled that their skin falls off their body so somebody's gonna have to make it through there you know the very initial battle and then die because they were brothers and everybody dies before the millennium so yeah that first week there on over here all of the uh that's going to be tribulation for the people over here right the other side of that well right here it's going to be not the great tribulation it's going to be tribulation yeah okay the great tribulation's about the war we're getting because even brother brown puts that on it but there's a tribulation period of three and a half years that's going to go on around the world because remember there's one thing for sure right in here somewhere there's going to be an earthquake that's going to devastate the united states of america that's why i'm telling you we've got to be built up as an army before that before that earthquake happens because once that earthquake happens we as a nation are destroyed and we can't speak for nobody that's why he's got to come in and make a covenant keep everybody away from the united states and then let them build back up or whatever happens it doesn't really matter what i want to do is make sure that we know that there's things going on in this week that you can't just say well there's only 1260 days left of the 70 weeks of daniel because you've got a lot to do in 1260 days it's really a short period of time when you bring in 144 000 people in all right so he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause to sacrifice an oblation to cease and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even until the consummation what the end and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate so see that scripture right there covers from right here it covers 483 years [Music] 2 000 years average just say 2 000 and know seven years okay that whole scripture covers from right here to right here now what we have to do is place it right it's like a puzzle that's got pieces missing out of it we gotta place it now we have placed i believe we placed all the puzzles up to right here [Music] even really to right here we placed all the pieces what's going to happen according to the bible all the way up through there now let's go to daniel excuse me daniel where'd you keep going yeah go ahead keep going yeah would you say okay when the tribulation's going up there's other stuff's gonna be going on now and that and the other people gonna be involved because that's what my family gonna be picked up the ones that i'm praying for that's come they're gonna have to go through the tribulation they're gonna have to be killed in this 1200 seats today and they're gonna do the tribulation but they're called well they're gonna be killed okay they're gonna be killed for the gospel that 1260 days well let's just be honest america is going to be desolated so there are going to be people going to come in and help us i mean i don't think brother brown said the russians would come into our streets and ravage our children and our and our wives right i don't think he's talking about us when he said to us he's talking about the united states right because you and i are not going to see that they're in tribulation yeah you and i are not going to say that that's not going to happen before the rapture that's going to be an after rapture event because remember the only two people that's got the holy ghost when that rapture takes place the only two people got holy ghost is two prophets on the whole entire earth two people now sure he brings in 144 000 along the way but when we go in the rapture there's two people that's got the holy ghost everybody else has not got it they'll be hunted down for the gospel that they believe and can't get it no no there's no way for a gentile to get the holy ghost in that right there's only 144 000 the only ones that can get the holy ghost in that period of time that lose anybody everybody okay with that so far when we go in the rapture there's no redemption for anyone except for two prophets and 144 000. now there will be the foolish virgin that's why the bible talks about the wise virgin going in the rapture or leaving rogerson comes takes them away foolish version of the left for the wailing and gnashing of teeth that's the people that we praying for that don't get the holy ghost that but but get sanctified gives their life for the gospel they'll be given eternal life but you know what the dead lived not the bible is real plain but you got to bring it all together the dead lived not for a thousand years anybody that's killed right here other than jews are gonna have to stay dead for a thousand years oh okay they don't come up until they walk on judgment watch on jackson way over here we got a long time before the real end time that's right i mean really there's a long time before the end time if the rapture took place today there's there's seven more years and then another thousand years before we come over to the white throne judgment so there's a long time until what men say is the end time will we stand before god and all those things long time but mine and your redemption is finished here that's why we have no time period we have no set day no time no season right when we're going to rapture we're done we're finished that's right we don't stand in judgment all we do is come back in here around in here we're going to come back and we're going to live a thousand years on the earth and i don't believe the earth is going to be like what we think the earth is going to be because the battle of armageddon is a natural battle structures of things will still be here okay just kills men kills people now the battle of gog and magog when god rains fire on the earth he's going to wipe her down to ashes again and then he's going to put a city down because remember in the millennium we're going to read it when we start reading scripture we're going to read that they will build houses you say how in the world are they going to be houses i don't care the bible says we're going to be allowed and inhabit them okay i don't think maybe we have to do that but there's other people that will build houses okay because i think we're pretty much finished for me brother brown said we're here on a honeymoon right yeah we're actually here to fulfill scripture okay because we got to fulfill this part right here number six right we have a connection with that number six the prophet of god told us we have a connection as as the bride of jesus christ we have a connection with the north the most holy because that anointing is us the temple's not but that anointing is us that's us coming back into the millennium in revelations 19. remember i told y'all about that the other day in 1921 us riding back in the millennium to inhabit a temple we walk out on the ashes of the wicked it's an atomic destruction so buildings buildings would be gone is that why we don't need a house but they they do the buildings to me i believe when we come back in the millennium we could see the structure of this of this building that doesn't all burn what i'm saying is it what you got to see is is that man or satan through man in all these apocalyptic things that we see on television they're not far off where do you think they get that idea from where do you think they get that idea from the word of god that's already told us satan you know satan is is perverting what god has told us was going to happen so um my point is if they're going to build houses they got to have something here to build them with or either wood or mortar or something i mean they're going to build it the jews are going to build a temple before we even get here we got to cover that so we ought to cover that time period in here that's what i mean let's don't get so hung up on that that's too much detail that that doesn't matter to me it's just what i'm saying is let's just remember the battle of armageddon kills people it does not destroy so much buildings you know they got an atomic bomb now that'll blow ever that'll kill everybody but leave the building standing why do you think they're doing that they're planning ahead don't you think our government all these other governments they're planning ahead they're trying to survive this apocalypse that everybody knows is coming everybody knows it's coming every nation knows this coming why do you think they have a little secret thing why do you think they're putting up this and putting up that and building stuff under the ground what do you think they're doing now to survive a holocaust or to survive an apocalypse survival man's gonna still try to survive it doesn't matter if he's a natural man he wants to survive that's why we put our hope in jesus do i take those fig leaves on yeah absolutely that's why we got put our hope in jesus and what he's done for us my brother dale can preach and we put our hope in christ that he will be the protector because buddy without him we have zero protection amen zero protection all right now let's go to daniel 12 and let's read this last chapter of the book of daniel before we go [Music] now 11 talks about governments coming in and all this because you you understand one thing for sure when when we go into rapture and all heck breaks loose over here we got earthquakes and california's gone probably a third of our population is going to be dead because it's not only going to kill them people are going to die of starvation they're going to die our malaria and all these other things associated with that earthquake right not just one big everybody did no so people are going to be coming in from all sides helping us to me that's when brother brown probably could see that the russians would come in and and you know well they're godless people they'll be godless people even normal people are godless people sorry but even the good kind people are godless people that's right that's right sorry that's just the way it is if you don't accept him now don't try to accept him then it's a problem i have with that uh somebody we were anybody ever watched that um left behind series with kirk cameron left behind the first one well well see the first one what they do is is they put the antichrist he kind of walks in the u.n and by mind control he takes over everybody i said well and see all the denominational people that love it somebody was saying something to me about it and i said well i saw the antichrist the first time thing came on the first five minutes of the movie because what their pretense was is that planes were falling out of the sky buses were wrecking and there was a rapture had taken place already and these were left behind then they get saved after they're left behind that's right so that's the anti to me the antichrist was the first five minutes of the movie that's right he was just showing himself at the end but the first five minutes of the movie when i started watching i said but see most denominational people believe that that's right that you're going to have a rapture and then after the rapture you're going to be able to get saved that is not there's no bible for that there's no truth for that that is an old wives tale that's right and really it is it's allowed the devil for what it is just like follow us on holy ghost baptism and all that you know it's a lot of the devil and people eat it up because everybody loved that left behind they had one and two you know they kept making them but the rapture is a secret and if a plane falls down in front of your automobile yeah that's no secret oh i know we'll see it was all over in the paper oh td jakes was on television you know and he was telling them that the raptor took place and i would that i thought what are you still doing here you know who did you know who t.d.j said black preacher and i mean he's really he's got some good ideas but he's denominational but i thought what are you doing on television in the directors what are you doing still here because he was telling them on the new on the on the news you know what it happened i thought either this is a recording or you're still here but it's not funny i mean it really is not because it's a deception that people are in and i thank god for the truth every day but you think when that california goes up that is gonna pipeline its electrical lines so i said more people will probably die afterwards than before of of uh disease infection you can't get to everybody broke bone you know internal injuries it's just gonna be horrible but now watch now watch here we go through 1260 days verse 12. and at that time shall michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people and who's thy people the jews right and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book 144 that's 144 thousand he's talking about by people he's not talking about us he's so much 144 000. michael comes down and stands and fights for him but he doesn't stay there he takes them in a rapture right there right there she becomes troubleshooting there was a nation at the same time at that time that piece shall be delivered somebody's got to be delivered somebody's got to be redeemed and taken up because i believe when you deliver something that means it's in one situation and you take them out of that situation and you deliver them out of that situation i believe that's what they're saying right everyone that should be found written in the book what the 144 thousand plus the two prophets let's not forget them now but you guys see that this is a twofold and many that sleep in the dusty earth shall awake some after like now what they've done the scripture now is way back over here because there's no resurrection of everybody until the white throne judgment this is where the judgment happened he says some to everlasting life now that's got to be people that were that had died without the holy ghost and then they're given eternal life everybody got that you're a little quiet all right but that's the truth that's it for the white throne that's at the white throne many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt that don't happen right here the judgment's not right here the judgment's over here all right and they that be wise shall silence shine is the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever but thou o daniel in other words daniel rest this ain't gonna happen during your time okay this is not gonna happen during your time daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end so daniel this is not going to happen until the end time and many shall run to and fro and knowledge should be increased then i daniel looked to behold there stood other two one on this side of the bank and the on the other side of the river and one said to the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river what is waters in the bible people he was standing in the people how long shall it be to the end of these wonders now look he's going to answer this in several parts all right we haven't covered this so we may have to cover it again but we're going to cover it now and i heard the man clogged and now look i'm sorry and one said to the man clothed in linen which was upon the world river how long shall it be to the end of these wonders what wonders from here up from here [Music] who are the two no actually i really don't know okay i really don't know maybe the lord will reveal that to us but one said to the other one how long shall be the end of these wonders all right and i heard the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven and swear by him live forever that it shall be for a time times and a half and a what dividing of time and a half and a half so you got one plus two is three and a half makes three and a half all right so this is going to start this accomplishing what and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people all these things shall be finished all right and i heard but i understood not daniel wasn't getting this but it wasn't for him and i heard but i understood not that i said i then said i oh my lord what shall be the end of these things daniel's asking that question the one on the the one on the the one up here asked the question and daniel wasn't in this i want you to watch one said to the man clothed in linen it's one of the two but then daniel comes down here and says and i heard and i understood not then said i so this is daniel talking to gabriel remember gabriel's one that's telling him this gabriel's one has given him these instructions then said i o my lord what shall be the end of these things daniel wanted to know exactly when that was gonna take place because the three and a half years is going to be for redemption of the holy people for what the the jews okay the 144 000 is going to be taken out all right and he said go that way daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end many shall be purified and make white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand and from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away it's not going to be taken away here remember we just read in daniel 9 24 it's going to be taken away in the midst of the week right from the time that's the day the sacrifice shall be taken away and the abomination to make its desolate set up there shall be one thousand two hundred and ninety days you say that's more than twelve hundred sixty i'll show you in a couple weeks while that has to be that way blessed is either weight isn't coming to the one thousand three hundred thirty five you got 1335 days now to deal with but remember it's not an addition this is inside of this which is inside of that got it it's not an addition to right exactly right it's going to happen this 1260 days which will complete daniel 70 weeks is inside this 1290 days and there's 129 days inside 1335 days you got it yes yeah but go that way we got to go till the end without short rants and standing on a lot of today all right [Music]
