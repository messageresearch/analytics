grace be with us we love you and we thank you guide us in Jesus name amen just regular scripture we've been reading in Revelations 3:14 and unto the angel of the Church of the lady of sanr these things sayth the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God all right let's just go back to where we were on the same scripture we used in the last message to Malachi 4 because I want us to pick up that part and try to continue on in our thought so remember now it says Malachi 4:4 said remember ye the law of Moses is my servant which I commanded unto him in for all Israel with his statutes and judgment remember what I said everything back there is pointing down here okay he told it all there he told what would happen there in Malachi all right now then he goes through the points of what would be there John the Baptist and in the end time to come to the uh forth coming of Elijah behold I will send you the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn a heart of the fathers to the children and a heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now I've been approached by some that ask about the services our Sunday morning and the brother and what he was bringing and and uh I had a discussion with him about that but I'm like this that's like I told him uh what anybody believes is their business that's their point that's all right that's that's their business you know to do whatever but then I said I've been approached about it so I I have to come to the pull pit and say a few words about it and uh if you'll notice he kept saying that that a lot of that was circumstantial well you know um we had a man back about a year before that had a whole lot about circumstantial and his point was that Adam placed his seed into Eve to save her well there's none of that written in the Bible so circumstantial means a point that in other words if you you got a witness to a crime and they witness that's not circumstantial right circumstantial is when you supposing a lot of things you know kind of doing it in that line and circumstantial and then you know brother saying those things that he brought out I said well I'm glad you said circumstantial because that uh you know I'm like this if the prophet says it I believe it all right but if he doesn't explain something then it's best for us to not to try to suppose a lot on what we think and we you know we see something and we say well that looks like that's got to be that's if the prophet didn't say that then you're going on your own even though you may think you have a right of that point and that's all right uh but you know the brother made the statement that uh ham had a relationship with Noah's wife which would have been his own mother and that was this the point that it says there you know what happened in uh with Noah but and that it it just won't hold together and that's what I expressed a couple of little points and I'll just make a statement or two and then we'll get off of that and go on now in the time when Noah and them you know after the ark the one question I asked him I said how old was Noah and his wife wife I said according to records there's no children was born you know other than ham sham and japeth to them and I said besides it the Bible says that Noah planted a Vineyard how long would it take to get a Vineyard up and another where you can get some grapes off of it to to be able I said you adding too much time you know to your point but I said it's all right but see that's he was taking his point and I enjoyed up to that part um I did I enjoyed what he had to say up to that was fine when Bringing Down the the seed of The Serpent and the things but I I didn't agree with that part so I went and just looked it up I knew what it was but I wanted to make sure I looked it up to see and brother brandham says I they can pull this up on questions and answers Real 2 and 54 uh 10:3 and I've run the message to try to find anything that related to any of the points and but this is what brother brandham says now you see ham sham and now ham he did not try to hide his father's now he did not try to hide his father's nakedness but laughed and made fun of it and God put a curse on him for looking to his father's nakedness and not trying to cover up his shame and ham sham and japo backed up and threw their coats over their father when he was laying naked and now God told ham that his this gener his generation would serve the others all right that was that was fine but you know I know they have it there go ahead and pull up the one in Genesis where it talks about it because I want you to look at the point of the scripture and Noah began to be in husbandman and he planted a Vineyard he drank the wine and was drunken was UN and was uncovered Within his tent now I mean that's just plain as anybody could want to know or read anything whatever you want to go from there now maybe some of you don't know it maybe I shouldn't mention it but for a long time back oh 30 40 years they were saying then that they believed that ham was a homosexual you may have heard that or may not have heard it but they were actually some of the men in the message were teaching that well I didn't agree agree with that and I don't agree with with the the person you know what was being said but look what he said and ham the father of Cana saw the nakedness of his father and told his two Brethren without it doesn't say a thing about him touching or anything no relationship no touching he saw him saw him laying there naked probably Noah got drunk you know and he was laying out there and look sham and japa took a gar and laid it upon both their shoulders and went backward and they covered their father's nakedness he had the scriptures he were using a lot of those things is throughout there about uh you know if you lay with this if you do this or if you do that if you do that but the one question I asked him and the question I would ask you is this this point uh he said and I told him about that and gave him the quote he said that Eve was cursed well now brother brandom according to uh paragraph 3:26 if you want to pull it up in the future home said do God didn't curse Adam he might have done the same thing but he cursed the Earth thorns and thistles he didn't curse Eve but said Adam would be her ruler amen I ask him a simple question that I ask you and it's a uh hypothetical or circumstantial circumstantial okay it's one we're we're just you know circumstantial a little the Beast was cursed and made a snake right all right now if Eve was to have been cursed would she been made a snake circumstantial evidences see we can all think and have our points and our thoughts not to try doctrinal issues or nothing because there's no doctrinal issues to those things you go into circumstantial things that you think looks good and and when you wind up it doesn't turn out too good because Eve wasn't cursed you say yes he was now the whole human race was cursed amen right the whole human race was cursed with the curse that was placed upon Eve the curse that was placed upon the the Beast made him a snake but the curse that came on mankind was not to make them go into the snake Kingdom you know it was to make them to be that the wound was cursed all right and see the brother kept he emphasized and gave a quote out of serpent seed emphasizing like ham and what he said was he said the seed come over in the ark just like it did in the beginning through the woman well that's all right that's the direct quote but see woman you may signify only one see he was leaning his thought toward Noah's wife but that doesn't work because that's not the quote brother brandham says now that's the quote he says it he said just like in the beginning through the woman their wives now if you can pull that one up on the serpent seed paragraph 197 see They Carried the seed of Satan right through the ark the wives what was it the polluted wound that's just simple that's not circumstantial that's plain sense because you know the Bible said that anything of woman is what full of trouble and no good but I'm just saying that I didn't care for that thoughts so that way and I did tell him I would correct it with the you know with the church and tell it I didn't agree with that but I wasn't going to lambast him about it that's everybody's belief to believe what you want to believe it's hard enough and problems enough to stay with the message to the point of taking and stay in with the way brother brandham brings it amen I don't mean that wrong I just mean it is hard enough to keep things straight sometime because the way sometimes he'll seem like he says this sometimes seem like he says that that you know and trying to bring together those things we don't need to hatch up some more things you know but see people those things they want something like to get an attention and like I said you know uh the doctrines has been there that they thought ham was a homosexual the doctrines has been there even as I mentioned it that uh you know that Adam placed his seed into Eve to save her that would make sex you're Redemptive and that won't work but just just let that go and let it let it I wouldn't I told him I said it doesn't bother me because I just don't believe it I said you know I'm not going to say you're wrong I'm going to say I don't understand it I don't understand it I can't see that away so then there's no problems with with doing that but that's all right that there you know I did write some little things in you know that to uh Express but um circumstantial like you say circumstantial evidence is proof of a facts offered as evidence for which other facts are to be inferred you know in in infer s in other words say that s contrasted with direct evidence it's not no direct and the word circumstantial using it by itself really means unessential y circumstances means when you look it up it means unessential it means secondary y it means incidental and and you know it just won't work you don't don't do it okay I made that point and I'm not nobody uh I still love everybody and forget it but I just don't agree okay now let's get into what we've been talking about now we've been talking about that's why we read in am Malachi the point there that we know they remember back a few weeks ago when we're preaching that then the the spirit of Elijah would come five times all right it came in Elijah it came in Elisha it came in John the Baptist it came in William brandham in the last days and it will be in one of the two witnesses over to Israel to finish the five times all right it's the same Ministry all right because all of it is bringing forth the word of God all right but it's not the same way a or thought or method or or doing you can't take uh you can compare brother brandom and the other Elijah by saying they were Wilderness men they were Hunters they were doing but that's not to do with their message you can't take the this message and do a lot with this message to this message to that message other than saying they're bringing the word of God all right so then it would be that you could have the five steps stages or whatever of the ministry of Elijah all right now my whole point has been for the past few Services is talking about the ministry of Jesus Christ all right now we went back to show it in stages how that before the Lord Jesus Christ was crucified he gave the disciples power to cast out Devils heal the sick even to raise the Dead the many great things was given them but there was some things that would be given later that were not instilled into them at that point but that was the ministry of Jesus Christ all right now I emphasized there that to me now that when you talking about the ministry of Jesus Christ and then you can look at and you can see healing and signs and wonders you can see it all down Through the Ages and through time that uh you know it's been there and see the reason it's been there was because Jesus Christ gave that before Calvary see then it would leave it open as we'll get to the scripture later tonight or maybe Sunday we'll get to the scripture where it says I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh that's right right all right now we know that that was poured out back there 2,000 years ago but we know too that it was poured out in the last days to fulfill the scriptures but remember now it's poured out in the last 2,000 years because I've got the quotes laying here from the prophet it's been poured out the last 2,000 well that means it started there and it's still being poured out it's just meaning the point that it started from The Upper Room experience in a great way and then come through the ages and it is to finish in the last days as the ministry of Jesus Christ then it's easier to look to see I'll get back to it more and more we look at and say well The Headstone was rejected well we don't know what it looks like we don't know no no no no you're you're wrong there your headstone is exactly the same thing as the Cornerstone Cornerstone was revelation of Jesus Christ so The Headstone has got to be the revelation of Jesus Christ but it's something that was not understood down through time that's right all right and I've tried to emphasize the point like I said Jesus gave them power they found a man over here healing in time there was not of them but Jesus said leave him alone it's in the gospel leave him alone said because if he ain't if he ain't against us he's for us you know leave him alone he just some way he picked up that point and it worked all right but then we found out that Jesus spoke of a coming of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the kingdom and as he spoke of those things that would take place in a greater manner or way when he would go go away and come back you don't have other disciples with the ability to impart eternal life before Calvary right but now after Calvary they're giv that right all right but just remember now that we kept giving the emphasis if you want them raise your hand with thow them on the screen or whatever to to for you to understand remember Jesus could not impart eternal life amen he said well now you getting well I well I mean I'm was honest I can be show it to me where he gave eternal life to anybody because the Holy Ghost had not been given that was John right and we gave about three quotes where brother random said that even Jesus could not preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost cuz it did not come yet he said well why did he preach he preached the Kingdom right right he preached the kingdom but he was saying it's at hand all right but then when he came into to Calvary and came back no longer is it preaching that's it's at hand like way out somewhere it's here all right now see then in doing that then see we know that Jesus himself not being able to now I'm looking at the quote where it's got it on the five identification if they want to pull that up it be number two if Christ would not let a bunch of men who'd walk with him for three and a half years go preach any gospel or could not preach any gospel until they waited for the Holy Ghost right the church today has to do the same thing what wait for the Holy Ghost all right see there's no way that you can give the Holy Ghost to anyone we know that it's not to say I'm going to impart eternal life I'll just F I'll just give it to somebody no that's what the man in Acts thought they were doing he said give me power to lay my hands on somebody and give them the Holy Ghost the way you've been doing it and Peter says you don't know what you're talking about in other words cuz he wasn't just giving out the Holy Ghost just laying hands on giving out and doing no it had to be done according to the word that's why your Prophet would emphasize what if you want to try to uh impart eternal life he said here's the water get them to the water what is imparting eternal life what would it be first is I remember I brought it out you had to have it and if Jesus could not preach it until he went to the stages you know or you want call it till it come to a place then of the crucifixion then when he came back he could impart eternal life right but he didn't just impart it on anybody you can't do that it's not to just give out like this go just give it out you got to go scriptural scriptural you got to go to the through the scriptures you got to line them up repent everyone and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost but now I hope you follow the point though once Jesus went to where he was and come back he could impart eternal life all right and once he could impart eternal life to the ones he imparted it to they could impart eternal life also not just go out I'll give it to you I I'll let you have it you can have it I'll hand it out not that way it's getting them in the word right getting them into the word telling them what the word says and you tell somebody repent every want be baptized I ain't doing that but I want the Holy Ghost well you ain't going to get it well you going to tell me I'm not going to get yeah I'm going to tell you a't going to get it is that plain enough going be no argument cuz ain't no argument to it if you won't do what the word says how can you get eternal life there's there's where the trouble with mankind see but now the point of doing all of that was to get to one thing that I ended the message up talking about the same Ministry that Jesus had so follow me now he gave him his ministry before Calvary that was his ministry they had the same Ministry he had they could cast out Devils they could heal the sick they could raise the dead and that's what he done but they couldn't impart eternal life they could in no way bring Salvation back to the people but neither could he that's right because he said he would do it that away all right and that's the way it's going to be done but then after Calvary and after the Holy Ghost came now you moved up a step in the ministry of Jesus Christ right you moved up to Salvation whereas before then you were only speaking of things to come but you come to Salvation all right there on the day of Pentecost then it was 3,000 Reed salvation at one time right right it was imparted right what did they say men and Brethren what must we do and I like the way brother R said it you know they said what must we do he said we tell them what not to do and all this that and the other he said that wasn't a question amen they didn't preach a legalistic message and got people saved now I don't mean I believe in firm believer and living right there's one quote in here that brother Brown says if you talk about the the being able to impart eternal life he said you got to have it in your life right it can't be done just because of anything all right but see the ministry of Jesus Christ the 3,000 went forth immediately under the ministry of Jesus Christ a partaker of that but now we know that they did not of the 3,000 receive the same position whatever you want to call it placing uh cuz you can't divide up in amount that doesn't work you know a mount that doesn't work uh the least little amount in God is just as much as the greatest amount that's right but that 3,000 see they they could go out and talk to others of eternal life that they had in their lives but still you see the group that had come to the upper room experience that that group was set in a deeper position amen higher position whatever you want to call it what you make the wordings set in a different realm all right brother Randon will use the word so we can use it and and and I'm sorry that that's all the words i' have but those in the upper room had a great deep experience that's cuz they'd been trained for three and A2 years but the ones outside 3,000 they only heard one sermon right but yet they received eternal life right now by them receiving eternal life they could have went out to help imp part eternal life that's right cuz they could go tell others how they got saved is that the way brother Rand said about it when the man come to it what should we do brother Randon should we seek gifts should we seek that should we do that he said just go tell how you candle got lit that's right go tell them about the Christ in you but that Upper Room experienced people were not as I was going to use the word right around uses the word novice yeah see no novice wrote anything in the scripture right you know it wasn't that all of those writers was in the upper room maybe because you got some like Timothy and different things but there was no novice used to write the word so then you would be counting the 3,000 as no this we heard this the other day about somebody that we've heard of and known and they're in a place and uh now they they they're going to be a preacher well that's all right I ain't saying nothing about it I'm just saying that you take them off his brother run set a dance floor on Saturday night and put them in the pull pit on Sunday morning preaching now that doesn't work too good you put somebody in a dry out clinic and then they confess they called to preach while they in the dry out Clinic I'm just too old that doesn't fit now I'm sorry I'm not telling God how to do his business cuz that ain't none of my business but I'm just saying that don't look too good that's right there's a lot of circumstan will around that circumstances will get caught up and that guy will when he comes out of and starts trying to preach he get into some circumstances all right but now see talking about I'm trying to get a point in your mind because I got a a message to follow this but I'm I'm trying to get a point in your mind of the ministry of Jesus Christ and people today would say I don't see the ministry of Jesus Christ see Believers in the message and people would say I just don't see the ministry of Jesus Christ well you want to meet right over here in this Baptist Church or or go to a Pentecostal church and see somebody healed or delivered from drugs and that's the point I've been making Jesus gave the disciples before Calvary that ability to do that and thereby pouring out his Spirit on All Flesh it would bring All Flesh to the ability to where they could pray for the sick cast out devils are you following me see that works you tell me that don't work then you tell me I don't see the ministry of Jesus Christ I just say meet me this Sunday we'll go up and gains with a free chapel and they'll probably have miracles in that service well who's doing it remember what Jesus said when they said he ain't one of us you know that's what the people in the message say right people in the message bad to say you know they're just not one of us we're we're something different well why don't we act different that's right that's right if we're the son of a king let's act like the son of a king that's right you remember the story son of the king you remember the African guy came over that was happy and doing and running the rest of them they had to beat him to get him to work he was acting like the son of a king cuz that's who he was all right see my point is to try to get you away from thinking negative thoughts amen negative thoughts to say we don't have the ministry of Jesus Christ well they've got it we can at least have that come on you going to tell me it's not out there working it's working in those ministers it's working in the people that's the ministry of Jesus Christ that's right if not whose Ministry is it now don't jump around with anointings because remember the anointing is the anointing of Jesus Christ so don't jump with anointings to say oh that's just anointings if anybody's ever healed it's got to be God doing the healing I don't care where they're at I don't care care if the pope of Rome does it I don't care if the Beatles done it that's right I don't care who it is is long if it works God was doing the working right well see then let's get away from that negative get away from I just don't see the ministry of Jesus Christ at least get to the point of confessing what's here amen you know that brother brand I want to get to it the Lord willing Sunday you know brother brand said God can't do nothing for you until you confess it that's right right and he said he can't do nothing for you that's right well you God can do what he wants to he can't break his own word when he said he wouldn't do it the prophet says he can't do it that's enough yeah right but see the ministry of Jesus Christ so now there right after Calvary you see even in that two stages of the ministry of Jesus Christ cuz you see a group of people that was in the upper room that were tutored by the word until they came to a place it didn't help my throat none for not preach for a few weeks so you pray for that but see that Upper Room experience put those disciples to right here where it said holy spirit on your pyramid now if you wanted I got it in the back where brother R said the disciples had these virtues uh what my spirit where that on the message the stature of a perfect man he said they had all these virtues in you here these qualifications so the disciples had them they didn't have the headstone right because the headstone was rejected it became the Chief Cornerstone right it's the same Stone it's the position of the stone so the position of the stone deals with different Ministry parts or whatever but the same Ministry the same Lord Jesus all right see then that 120 The Upper Room you can place them with as we would call it the faith of the father right cuz that would be what would have to be with Elijah now come on Elijah turned John the Baptist now brought the message stood between the Old Testament and the New Testament was the Keystone to plac in there to be able to identify Jesus Christ right was not that the ministry of Jesus Christ yes because it was meant to be that he would introduce all right but he could not bring to PA what he was introducing because that was meant for somebody else in another day or another stage or another part that's just what I'm trying to get you to see John the Baptist according to what we read in the Bible that's part of Elijah would turn the hearts of the Old Testament Saints to the New Testament message is so what it says turn the hearts to the fathers to the children what is the New Testament message the New Testament message is not a baby now come on listen when he turned those I was trying to hit it the other day where you'd think about it John spoke of the coming Messiah and introduced him right and when those 120 received him they received the faith of the fathers turned to the faith of the children not meaning the babies not in relation to baby form turning them to the New Testament message brother brand said John turned he spoke and pointed that and those disciples even some of his disciples left them and John and went with Jesus see he what he brought was enough come on folks right thank sensible do you realize when he introduced that one standing on the shores of Galilee who he introduced not a man every scripture that would be in the New Testament everything in the book of wed on the Seals Everything About That lamb to take the book there he stood amen there he stood it on on the shores of Galilee amen he didn't just turn them to a faith baby he turned them to a full grown sons and daughters of God that came out of the upper room with the ability to write the word not novices or babies or anything full grown men in the gospel and women called a faith of the fathers then they took the faith of the fathers and taught it that's what Peter was doing in second Peter they took the faith of the fathers and they taught those that had come in and receive the new birth of the 3000 and the others that received around as you would be going out to the house of Kus and the different ones and they begin to teach them the faith they had right right trying to get them to see where they had been turned to not to just a baby thought no they were full grown come on let's get out of the fact of whether the egg come first or the chicken well you don't know which one well I do cuz God started everything as full grown Adam and Eve was full grown the disciples was full grown right you said but they didn't have a headstone now come on that's why Paul would pick it up later in the scriptures and bring it to you don't go that route you're making yourself run off they had a head back there there's been a head on way down to ever Church age sir amen that's right the head of God is the word but it's just not come back into the stone that was to be because it was a stone of stumbling are you following me then the 3,000 and all of those outside could start coming up to where the disciples were and that's the ministry of Jesus Christ right that's why they could say Silver and Gold Have I None but in the name of Jesus Christ right see then here comes time down through and I've got quotes lay here where brother Brown said the same Ministry of Jesus Christ come down through all the ages you going to read that it wasn't another Ministry down through Luther and Wesley and them in the in the Dark Ages and thing you know some kind of it was the ministry of Jesus Christ might have been in the ministry of Jesus Christ it that the 3,000 received sure might have been that part but it was still the ministry of Jesus Christ there was no age without the ministry of Jesus Christ there was no age without the Holy Ghost you can't have it see then it's to get our thoughts away from well I just don't see we've got to confess what we see amen and this is not a new message to me you've done been women know it's a 40y old message now I've been teaching you 40 years these things not just just coming down to this thought because I've always taught the ministry of Jesus Christ come down through there and you and I are the ones that the prophet would say we're living below our standards why because we won't say What God Says yeah get on that now that's Sunday's message okay all right pull back walk over here but what about it brother brand him on a message called Philadelphian Church age he said the ministry that he gave them was actually the sharing of his own Ministry with them for it says it in Matthew 935 to 38 the disciples had the ministry of Jesus Christ that was what it was was the ministry of Jesus Christ in them go on down and just keep pulling up some we'll read go down to the next one confirmation of the commission which is number nine while they're getting it up to that point it says the same Holy Spirit he's talking about Paul and Saul and now that same Holy Spirit we find it right amongst the Pentecostal people today what the same Ministry of Jesus Christ the evening light right down amongst the Pentecostal people what preaching the same gospel giving Vindication of the same gospel the same signs that followed there is the same signs that follow now and if that Pillar of Fire listen our light that we have with us did not produce The Same Spirit and the same evidence it did when it was in Jesus Christ then it would be the wrong Pillar of Fire the wrong Spirit be the wrong thing but if it does produce and do just exactly what Jesus done when he said he that believeth in me the works that I do do you understand do you follow what he's saying but yet we say we don't see the ministry of Jesus Christ why are we say Going On To The Next One patas Vision number 10 on you and he brings it down in talking about an angel for each Church age oh that's going to be beautiful this week when we go back Yonder in history and pick up them angels and see the very same Ministry they had right we see the very same they had the same Ministry exactly the same all down through the ages in that little church the ministry of Jesus Christ has never left the problem with it is because mankind has rejected it by doubting it now he's talking about in the ages that the people having it the same Ministry Jesus Christ had had had is in his church tonight I'm going right on down through the Ephesian Church age he says they had the same Ministry they did at the beginning and that Ministry cannot change it must stay Pentecost all the way through number 12 he coming down to the unconditional Covenant the same Ministry Christ had in his had is in his church tonight same signs same wonders Same Spirit same kind of works that Jesus did here on Earth the church has to do the same thing if it's not it's not to the seat of Abraham it's not the Church of Jesus Christ that's right see we come down to our age and we see the ministry of Jesus Christ and brother brandham that's what's wrong with the people now see they can remember what was back there that's right but they'll say we don't have the ministry of Jesus Christ see then what you're doing is you're cutting off all the whole Ministry of Jesus Christ because your thoughts are built upon the ministry in brother Bram there'll never be another Ministry one person that will be able to do that it can't be done amen it won't be done I don't care who says it is it can't be done why because that would be make a prophit out of the person and that's not according to the scriptures it's unfinished am you'd be trying to get six or seven Elijah that won't work we see our minds is connected back to the thoughts of the things that the people of the end time saw amen that was the ministry of Jesus Christ but that's not what he's talking about here cuz he says the church right well you got to argue with him about it look what he goes on down to the faith once delivered to the to the Saints the holy spirit's here with the same Ministry that was delivered to the Lord look what stop by the Lord Jesus Christ to his apostles and she's come through a Darkness but the clouds are clearing back the same holy spirit is come to revealing the same thing he said the same one he passed out there's never been an age without the ministry of Jesus Christ there's never been an age without the Holy Ghost of Jesus Christ it may be not be in the manifestation I'm not saying that I've taught that that's what I hope you're catching on you say when well just listen to watch being sad when the upper room took place there was 120 right that had been two to three and a half years but when the Holy Ghost fell outside it fell on a group of people of 3,000 that had just heard one message that's right amen but it's the same Ministry of Jesus Christ right amen at least we could say that well I just don't see it I just don't see it well then what would it take for us to be able to see it right look what he says on Watchman what of the night and now the spirit of God in the church today is just exactly like it was when it was in Jesus in Christ Jesus same y do you understand what I'm trying to get us to a point of thinking get us to a point of not sitting down and not looking for something but to believe what is here while we're sitting down if you want to do it that way you see that's the way I see God and the way I see Jesus Christ whatever he was he still is and what he is he always had been that's right or Hebrews 13:8 is wrong right I just don't see it well then what what's wrong right I know you don't like me to make the statement of the point but I've asked you to do it sit down sometimes and calculate the healings that was in the 20 years of the book of Acts write down how many healings and miracles happen in the 20-year period from Calvary to the book of Acts I mean you know coming on over to the first church age brother random then it won't stumble you or throw it in the wrong way for him to say I've seen more in one service that is in the book of Acts Church calculate Among Us the things God has done some of you have been here 20 years go back and calculate some of the healings and the signs and the Wonders amen that has taken place that's just is in this group what about the whole group around the world what about the lady over there overseas that had that meal Barrel that never went out there's a lot of people went over there and tried to eat out of it see if he get it eat up and it didn't work see we've seen the signs and wonders it's Jesus Christ if you're ever healed it's Jesus Christ I don't care if you take aspir and get rid of the headache the aspir is not doing it Jesus Christ made a way where that would work upon the human body see all I'm trying to do is get us to a point of confessing confessing the position that we're in that's right see then I expect I've told you over and over it's a little off paraphrase I meant the other day and I brought it to you but it's not exactly word for word the way we always quot it but it's still saying the same thing I believe there'll come such a baptism of the Holy Ghost from heaven will fill every five being and take us into Rapture that's a quote it's close in the paraphrase but it's close enough to be right so I'm not sitting down not looking for something no I look every day rode by over yesterday and Wade was bushhoging and I tried to catch up with him and missed the road and June finally she I on know on the phone with her to ask her what road he was on and she said just go over there brother there where you saw the Lord at and turn right I knew right where she was at you remember the story I saw the Lord about 11 years old 11 12 years old somewhere in I went by there yesterday I slow down I said Lord thank you for meeting me there but I said Lord I thank you you didn't stay there now I don't mean he he de christianized nobody he didn't stay there see they became a denomination and cut it all off he had been put on outside that was what my thoughts right and I said Lord thank you for coming out where I'm at and getting me and bringing me on you know God I believe that I look forward to every day in Christ am when I pray for somebody here and you come up to me to be prayed for prayed for you when I pray for you and you don't get healed that makes me sick at my stomach right I don't go home blaming you I don't go home and say well if so and so hadn't been in the church maybe you it would have been all right I got the quote from the prophet where one person I know how to quote too I know you can quote yourself to death I blame myself when you are not healed and I believe if we'd ever bet every one of us get that idea in our mind to blame our own selves I believe we'd see more of God dealing Among Us right right that's right yeah but we've got all kind of things we can do it with you know you remember the brother here one time that said he saw the pillar of fire around a pool pit I'm not doubting him and he saw it two or three times around the pull pit and he told one day he said I saw the pillar of fire and said it was leaving the pull pit going down a brother got up later ministering and used a little circumstantial evidence and he said brother Dale the pillar of fire was leaving out of the church I come right back behind him and I said no way the pillar of fire wouldn't leave and out of the church it was going back where I wanted to go where the people's at it was going to the congregation where the people was at cuz that'll get it away from looking at pillars of fire around me and you'd believe what was said if there a pillar of fire hanging around me I just swear I've always tried to be honest you can't build something around some kind of an idea or thought that's circumstantial right well brother Dell I believe you this I believe you that like I told you twice I've approached it from this pull pit when people would say I was a prophet and I said no I will not have that to be brought to understanding in this pull pit that I would in any way consider myself to be a prophet why because I don't believe it well what are you I'm me that's the best way to say it I'm me what are you trying to find some gimmick or thing that would work and then You' say the ministry of Jesus Christ is here when brother brandham said that that day he said I'd rather see love among a group of people then five maybe if I miss it I believe it's right 5,000 Miracles or something healings in there he said he'd rather to see love amen right then the healing and you know what I told Brother Mo when he told me about the things that happened in brother Brandon's Ministry and I believed him I believed him that it took place but I said I can't depend on that that but you tell me what he taught and I'll know whether or not he was a prophet of God thank God I got a hold of somebody that could tell me what a prophet taught yes sir and I still stand on that this day to believe that what God has brought to you and I the same Ministry of Jesus Christ is here amen at least we could say it's here as the the disciples had it before Calvary amen do you understand you see what I'm talking about if it's working why can't we say it's Jesus Christ well they're not one of us might find out we're not one of us right right that's I liked old brother Theo Rasmus when he was bringing that message that time and he said said look at there he said his name is j s u s cuz he's reading the scripture about us and us and us he said his name is j s us he said you take the US off of it and said his name is Jess and he said you take me and you away from it said his name would just be Jess it wouldn't be Jesus I Glory Hallelujah I shouted about it because I always thought the prophet tried to teach us that we're a part I thought he taught us that the godhead wouldn't complete without you amen you see the prophet spoke and pointed to a church a word born bride sure we're living way below our privileges yes sir way below it right but you know what we're still here I was talking to a man at work down there one time and uh he was talking about you know the the Catholic church and the wrong and he said H it he said how many Catholics are they at that time it was like 500 million or something it was way back you know and uh he said in other words you're trying to tell me that there's 500 million people's wrong and you're right I said I didn't say that but I believe it and he said you mean to tell me that God would something would hear you more than you hear them I I'm still alive I said that ever right to not be I'm still alive he come back and apologize he said I didn't mean it that way I said that's all right but listen Church we've got to confess it now we'll pick that up Sunday and going on if we don't confess it God can't do it CU now listen listen and read your Bible everything in the Bible someone confessed it it as being are you listening someone said it right the Bible is a record and has natural things in it of Life yes but inside of that is a bride of Christ or people of God that have spoken all the way down that's what Martin Luther done when he walked out there and he said the just shall live by faith he said it right God made it live God brought it on sin he made it live what if he'd never said it oh well somebody else would have Oh Glory you're great you sure a believer in God and predestination ain't you well you don't think somebody else could said it no I know they couldn't say it you know why cuz Luther said it that's right right does that solve the problem a lot of people said it but God never come on the scene to what they said but when Luther said to just shall live by faith God said Heaven opened Glory go down now and make it alive in the people cuz he said what God Said right I thought confession was to confess what God Said say what he said but I'm trying to hold it to a point tonight of understanding the one thing let me go back to it again I don't mind that I hope you do Jesus Christ gave the disciples before Calvary his ministry and it was the same Ministry he had that's right they had the ministry that he had the same one then one the day of Pentecost he came back and lived in them the same Ministry that he had right the 3,000 receive the same ministry as just a new birth babies but they begin to grow in Grace and knowledge and that lasted for four ages you hear your Prophet saying it that the pure unadulterated word lasted through the first four ages it began to dwindle down yes and going down but it last in state but see then you come out with Luther them that's why it comes out with the very first one talking to somebody the other day about why did it come out in that age and said you got a name that you're living but you're dead it was the name of Jesus that was lost not that they called him some other name not that they called him by another Jim Joe Charlie or something no it was the Revelation so the faith of the fathers was lost right down through that ages but the Holy Ghost wasn't lost that great ministry that those Apostles Apostles had be to deteriorate brother RS when that said it he said the bride should have never went to NAA I know people right here that differ with me in this pull pit about that but I can't help it brother r one said it he said they come back with things they shouldn't have come back with you said people with the faith of the fathers yes people with the faith of the fathers went down to see they come out of there with just little sayings and little thoughts that begin to just Trinkle down until the faith of the fathers was lost but you never lost the ministry of Jesus Christ because it was down through every Church age and every time he was still alive still manifesting himself zeusa Street comes back and the prophet said no Messenger to the age of zeusa street he said because the Holy Ghost came himself in the fullness he he said of the baptism but he said then at end the age of messenger would come what did he start out doing read your statue of perfect man I hope you've read it over and over he says on there he said that it took him 30 years to come to that place of preaching that sure he knew about it sure he knew about the faith of the father sure he knew about adoption he had taught it before then and coming down what was it that he said he said I just got this right here the other day down in the woods what the ability to become to the stature of a perfect man right add to your faith virture knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and in love church I've taught that all along I don't understand see I've always looked for Jesus Christ but yet I know and realize if I don't confess it he can't do it oh now you man yourself something you he can't I didn't say it we'll get on it Sunday your Prophet is one that said it he said if we don't confess it he can't do it that's right somebody's got to say it do you understand what I'm saying Martin Luther come out of there right exactly in the word of God and said that just shall live by faith and God said that's it open up the doors of Heaven because a Zeus of streets coming and I'm going to pour out my spirit cuz it's started right now in Martin Luther right I can pour out my spirit then he says on All Flesh your sons and daughters what in my handmaids it go out on everybody that's why the anointing can work and go on people that's right and things can take place because God poured it out right yeah but then a prophet came on the scene and God began to restore right then and a prophet was more manifestation of God than had ever been down through time right right before all of that it had never worked the way that worked that's right the great Apostle Paul would holler a Man Out Of Glory to hear that cuz he know it's true see Church we've got to come back to the faith of the fathers before we can talk about anything else but you know what I love to hear Brother Rand make statements like I was thinking there a while ago when I said Luther said that you shall live by faith and God come down I'd like for you to go home and get the message called a Rapture either read it or listen to the tape and listen very carefully when he gets over in the message and he says he's speaking of the Rapture the change how many of you know what he said he said it has been spoken now let it come to pass you say a't that just a little bit no I believe if he hadn't come and told us that we wouldn't know how to go to a change that's right that's what I believe we' have to go by the grave somebody else have to pull us up y right right right but he said it has been spoken now let it come to pass cuz see Paul could just say change the moment twinkle of an eye he couldn't see it but when it come down to brother brandham see he seen it he just didn't get to walk into it at that place come on right do you understand the ministry of Jesus Christ and see we still left off one thing if you've listened and we're going to drop back Sunday pick up a little bit to the confession but they still a headstone even though we talk about the faith of the fathers there's a headstone to come after that there's more to come but it's more the ministry of Jesus Christ but if we don't walk now here's my lifesty statement if we can't walk now and saying Jesus Christ is alive among his bride around the world doing great signs and wonders and miracles and things happening then we're confessing him to be the same yesterday today and forever amen that's right but Brother D I just can't see it I didn't know that it was to be seen I thought it was to be believed I thought the scripture says what not we see to believe it say we believe to see let us believe it and start talking about it right instead of the mey mouth down and out as brother for he said wowy wowy wowy W you know at least let say it come on we'll get to it Sunday is it right you cannot be healed if you don't say you're healed you cannot be saved according to the Book of Romans unless you confess with your mouth of what you're believing in your heart that's what says you believe it in your heart you remember the lady or who it was told the other one said I got the Holy Ghost other day but said don't tell nobody now they didn't get the Holy Ghost they didn't get the Holy Ghost right go you want to tell everybody come on musician I just want you to think about it think about what I'm trying to say the ministry of Jesus Christ let's confess it is here that's right amen it is because if we don't confess it's here what is to come will never come and if it does we don't we won't know what it is right we won't know what it is but if we confess it then God can that's right come upon our confession now think about that scripture and read it if you can he maketh intercession Upon Our confession all right now if that's plain sense then what does it mean if we got plain Common Sense what does it mean when you say that he makes intercession Upon Our confession that means if you don't confess it he ain't making no intercession right you say yeah well I've got the Holy Ghost all right keep confessing for more all right what do we got 369 let's Stand Together the Mighty God is Jes Jesus Prince of Peace is he the Everlasting father the king

believe you and we thank you father in Jesus name amen let's go do it anybody see we don't thank too much about Christ I was up in Tennessee one time a lot of you know the story and brother Richard Wilson was real sick and seemed like it kidney stones I'm not certain but he was real sick he lives so some of you don't know it he Liv lives back one house behind the church you know so I walk up
