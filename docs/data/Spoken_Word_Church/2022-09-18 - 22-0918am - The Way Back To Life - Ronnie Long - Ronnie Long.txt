as we get ready for the word thank god for the brothers and sisters that helped out with all these singing and that's all the specials and for our young children to uh they're not children anymore for these young adults to sing and sing it from the heart and know what they're talking about we hear those songs on the radio and when somebody out you know out there singing them which is fine and that's okay the words inspired but when an inspired person when an inspired person sings an inspired song that's when the two meet together so we appreciate everything that you do uh to get this together and and singing and and worshiping the lord man he said yesterday brother ronnie said what kick him out and we've been preaching let it out so whatever you got i hope we've kicked the devil today out of this building and that god will have liberty today as our brother comes and speaks for us good to have brother ronnie long all the way from ohio and his family sister felice and and all the kids i can't remember all of them's name i'm not going to try but they're just beautiful kids good to have them here with us good that like i said again have our visitors and have everybody here we're here to hear the word of the lord now the most important part we'll sit back and listen keep that anointing on you if you do something may happen you never know amen i appreciate that i appreciate brother luis and all the song leaders and different ones to bring the atmosphere so that our brother can preach he can plow the field and not have to worry about it so let's think open the eyes of my heart as our brother comes to ministers brother ronnie long open the eyes of my heart lord you pull on the gift without getting something from god oh i want to see you open the eyes of my heart oh open the eyes of my heart i want to see you oh jesus i want to see you [Music] [Applause] [Music] shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy [Music]

the house of the lord with you all it's uh i think i'm using this one here maybe he said the blue one all right is that okay don't put my hand on the receiver i remember that from last time put it up here praise the lord give me the house of the lord this morning amen thank you for the songs and all the all the praises that were sung there's no better way to call him on the scene than to praise his name amen no matter how you feel you might feel tired might feel sleepy you might feel indifferent but as soon as he comes on the scene everything changes amen praise the lord i don't see uh no yes okay you may be seated you may be seated yeah we ain't saying in about probably eight months or so so we didn't practice or anything i'll give us some grace amen no sir he said just feel at home so we feel at home man you're gonna see the first one [Music] there's a piece i've come to know [Music] though my heart and flesh may fail there's an anchor for my soul [Music] has overcome and the grave is [Music] the over is [Music] when he calls my name no more sorrow no more pain i will rise [Music] before my god fall on my knees and rise i will rise there's a day that's strong [Music] [Applause] [Music] up [Music] [Music] and the grave is overwhelmed all the victory [Music] is he is [Music] [Applause] [Music] before my god fall on my knees and rise [Music] i will rise [Music] is [Music] and [Music] and i hear the cry [Music] and i will rise when he calls my name no more sorrow no more pain i will rise on eagle's wings before my god fall on my knees and rise [Music] [Applause] believe that's talking about you it's a little different when it's talking about you amen you're singing about somebody else or somebody else's victory but when you're singing about your place in the book then it means something amen and i hear the voice of many angels sing worthy is the lamb amen i believe we have a place in the scripture where singing worthy is the lamb amen you can stand with us and open your bibles to john the 14th chapter it's good to be here thank you for the invitation the hospitality everything's just been wonderful brother samuel god bless you and it's good to be here and those who like precious faith thank you to the canadas for putting us up and putting up with us and all the screaming kids running around the house amen some people we go travel around and we'll stay with some folks and it's just stressful the whole time because you're worried about the kids upsetting something or knocking something over but i like to stay with folks that are used to having kids so we thank you rachel for the opportunity amen i'd like to speak for a few moments this morning on the way back to life the 6th verse of the 14th chapter jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me if you had known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth you know him and have seen him we drop down to the 26th verse but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things some things all things and bring you all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth i give unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid amen father we ask that you would just be with us this morning and lord we've laid ourselves aside lord we've we we've surrendered ourselves to you afresh at your altar this morning father asking that you would just have your will and your way father may you find us under the blood this morning lord may we find a refuge in in your word this morning i pray that you just hide us under your the the shadow of your wing father and lord it's just words on a paper unless you're here to quicken it to our hearts father and lord we ask that your spirit would just have preeminence lord father we take every spirit in this building under our control lord that be subject to your word father lord that everything will be done in perfect order lord and that you would just be well pleased with what's said and done in here this morning lord i pray that our hearts will be open lord as a field ready to harvest father lord may we just hear from your throne this morning we ask in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated amen amen i like that scripture there because he's promising us peace not that the world gives unto you he's not saying that he's going to give us world peace but he's giving us the peace of the holy ghost the peace that passes all understanding when we don't know where we're going or where we're coming from we have a promise of peace and i know i've had to lean on that promise in this scripture many times in my life to know when i don't know how tomorrow's going to come i know who's holding tomorrow i know that it's going to come in his hand and i know that his decision is perfect and he's never made a mistake about it and he's not ever retreated or regretted but his decisions are perfect the first time and i thank god that we have a peace with the holy ghost that he promised to send it in our time and in our age and you know we can get a long way with just an intellectual intellectual conception of what this word is and we can make it a long way down the road with just understanding the knowledge of the word but when he the spirit of truth comes and he comes into us and he leads us and he guides us in all things unto perfection that's when we're walking a real christian walk when it's not us trying to make the effort to do it but it's he the spirit of truth within us that's doing the work within us amen first john the fourth chapter if we could turn to that i'm sorry brothers in the back you just have to give me grace beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ has come in the flesh of god and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god i believe that applies to today every spirit that testifies that jesus christ has come in the flesh in this hour is of god and every spirit that does not testify that he's come in the flesh it's not of god right i don't believe there's an expiration date on first john 4. did you see one there i didn't see an expiration date so i believe that's current and up to date amen and this is that spirit of antichrist wherever ye have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world ye are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world they are of the world therefore speak thee of the world they of the world and the world heareth them but we some we say we we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error so we have two spirits working within the framework of the church right we have two spirits that are that are actively working within the church but we've just been given a promise in first john to say that we recognize the true spirit we will recognize the spirit of error and we will recognize the true spirit and one we will reject and one we will accept so the choice is up to us of which spirit we're going to accept in this age i believe it's clearly defined on which spirit is the spirit of truth it's the one that leads you and guides you into all things it's he that has come we're not waiting for him to come it's he that has come he is leading us and he is guiding us i'm so thankful that we have a sure word in this hour i'm not wondering where i'm going or what i believe in or how i'm going to get there but i've already been given a word of prophecy that tells me my destination i've just got to put my name attached to that right you've got to see yourself in every scripture i see myself here in this scripture is recognizing the spirit of truth in my day i'm not looking for another answer i'm not looking for another option i already have a secure word i'm not looking to to to move on or sell out if i was going to sell out i would have sold out years ago keep my hand up i thought you were getting excited and saying amen but he was just telling me to keep my hand up many people will sell their souls for a price some will sell it for a million million dollar american idol contract or some will sell it for uh uh you know being a maybe a basketball star a football star or maybe they'll sell it for much less maybe they'll be some basement warrior playing some video game in their in their room all day and that's what they've sold their soul to but i believe i believe in this age we have a sure word of prophecy of what what our soul is valued at i'm not going to sell myself short to say that i i'm just almost going to make it to the line and then i'm going to fall short but we are given a sure word of prophecy that we will cross the line there is a generation of finishers in this hour that will finish the work that was started 2 000 years ago we will finish the word that was started when paul preached it the word that was started when peter preached it the word that was prophesied when jesus spoke it there will be somebody that will finish that work i believe we make up that group of people in this hour we're not selling short for some distraction of this world but we've been given a prophecy that we follow that because it means it's our life it's our source it's our it's our blood we're not selling ourselves for a million dollars or some religious spirit but we know where we're going many people have the bible and they sell themselves to some church or some foundation or something that will give them an offering or a better check somewhere and they'll sell themselves to that but i have i have sold out to this message i'm not looking for anything else i've sold everything that i am for this i'm not looking for another reason or a question of how to get out of it i've sold everything that i am to it i would ask every individual what have you sold yourself to you you know i've been attacked for selling myself out to the prophecy of what they call a man but i said you sold yourself to much less you sold yourself to uh to a work contract that works not even going to make a difference that job will fire you next year when times get tough that bank account you've been building will get empty as soon as the irs comes for it that house that you paid off it's not really yours that property that you work for it's not really yours but we we need to be sure what we've anchored our soul into every hour that we spend on this earth is going to be accounted to something we've got to know what it's accounted to i would rather be i'd rather be guilty of spending of spending all my time around this word than spending way too much time building a kingdom for somebody else for some some pharaoh out there somewhere or some egyptian somewhere out there that doesn't care about you and you might be building your own company but guess what that company be taken away tomorrow just like that i know i have my own business i know how close it is when the irs decides that it's you it's theirs it's theirs you can run everything right you could cross all your eyes and cross your well you dodge your eyes and cross your t's yeah right right but the point i'm making is that our we must be secure in where we are invested in you know for for for ages the church has been looking for for a fruit to come for the for the first stage they were looking for a fruit to manifest in the second age they were looking for a fruit to manifest and and and and they're looking for that all through the ages but i believe we are at the age when that fruit is at the top of the tree when that fruit is coming to life and it's bringing forth how do you know what kind of tree it is by the fruit that it's producing you know we we it seems like man as we go along in time and we go along in history and you just have to bear with me i hadn't i had planned on preaching something else and this morning i woke up and it was like an audible voice said to me preach this so i had to re-go back through these notes and refine the inspiration of it but the lord told me to preach this and then i found out during the song service why but i believe the lord has something in store for us but it seems like it's become a uh uh it's a billion dollar industry looking to see where you've come from you know 23 23andme or ancestry.com and everybody wants to know where they've come from what's their what's their makeup and what's their genetics and how do they get to be where they're at and a man is always questioning to know where he came from what's my history how did i get to where i'm at uh who was my dad and who was his dad and who where did they come from and uh you know my wife uh we got we the kids and i we got her for mother's day one of those 23andme things and so she sit back and uh you know she finds out she's from all over different places of the world and you know you might not know where you come from you said i'm kind of scared to send my dad i don't know where i've come from you know you think you're one thing and you find out you're something totally different but i believe as end time believers we didn't just start in some sub-saharan desert somewhere or some african jungle somewhere or some swedish uh uh glacier somewhere but i believe we had a beginning and i believe that that is the heart of man is to find his way back to where he came from because if he can find his way back to where he came from he knows where he's going from here he knows how he's going to get back to to end this circle of time i believe we've been given a direct line back to our our forefathers our forefathers did not start just a few hundred years ago when some ships came over here to this country but my forefathers started back in the little upper room back on the day of pentecost when they were caught up in one mind in one accord and they were all together gathered under one spirit of christ and there a generation was started and that generation still lives today in the believer to finish the work which was began back there in the upper room i'm not ashamed to tie myself you know as some people might find out that they're related to some criminal or some some mastermind back into and they might be ashamed to tie themselves to that i am not ashamed to tie myself back to my heritage i know where i came from i'm not ashamed to tie myself to a tongue-talking uh son of god acts believing working in the power of christ son of god i'm not ashamed to tie myself to that i know where i came from and there's no other way i'm gonna get back to where i'm going unless i see the line in which i came how did they get there i'll get there the same way how did so and so i'll get there the same way how did peter find it i'll get there the same way there's only one way to get back to life and it's through this message we will not find it any other way you would not find it through uh some denominational whim or or some thought of a man or some theology if that was gonna happen they would have found it ages ago but it's at the appointed time god will cause this bride to see herself in the word so clearly that she will manifest the fruit of it it won't be a question to her but there's one provided way back to that kingdom we're not from this kingdom of england or this kingdom of united states or but we're from an original kingdom it didn't have a beginning and it won't have an end i don't know about you church but that's excites me i'm not from this just this states here or just as far as i can travel there but i'm from another kingdom that will not have an end it didn't have a beginning and so i am part of that as it is part of me we're walking in that that's our inherited rights we have authority in that kingdom you know we used to used to try to blend in with other kingdoms right we should try to blend in that's why we don't feel at home when we go to walmart we're not from walmart that's why we don't feel at home when we go i yesterday we needed something from the store i googled dollar general close to joe's house and there was like 127 red dots popped up on the map i said my there's more dollar generals here than there is people that's why we don't feel at home when we go to dollar general we're not from this kingdom we're not meant to blend in you know we used to play then when i was in high school i blended in with the rest of the football team when i was out in the world i bled tried to blend in with the rest of the world when i was when i was uh when i was a good hypocrite in the church i tried to blend in with the rest of the believers in the church but you see we're not meant to blend in with this world we're from another kingdom we've got to recognize why we believe what we believe that's a question that we all are going to ask right and i'm just building a foundation i hope i hope we're okay that's a question that we're all going to ask ourselves at one point why do we believe what we believe if this message is just codes and rules to you you miss something and this is just a way to live your life and your skirt's got to be just this long and your heels have got to be just this short and you're going to get away with just this much makeup or you can get away with just as much trimming your hair you've totally missed the point of why a prophet came he did not come just to tell us not to wear purple shoes he came to reveal christ in our day he came to reveal a living god in our hour that we can recognize that the same messiah is here today that was here 2000 years ago and he's living in flesh through you and i it's not just another set of rules to me it's not just an uh just a thing i have to follow but i'm so in love with this word that it's everything that i am it's my being it's my makeup it's the breath that i breathe this word is life to me it's not just a a creed or a theology but what do you say it is peter who what what do men say that i am well if you can only hear they would say this they would say that you know you're just uh you're just the son of of joseph and mary and you have no authority to be doing the things that you're doing hmm what did you say about it peter first he asked what do men say they said what about you as an individual what do you say that i am so that takes it down to another level for us we can't just say well the pastor preaches it like this or so and so believes it like this but what do you say as an individual about this christ that you've come in contact with what does it mean to you is it another set of rules or codes you'll end up in the side of the road somewhere you'll end up off in a ditch somewhere but you must see it as the living christ in this hour it is jesus manifest in a bride body walking talking preaching delivering saving healing the same works that he did shall you do also and greater works because there's more of us believing the same thing many messiahs right messiahs but some say this or that what do you say about this message i want you to really think about it what do you think about it what do you say it is what does it mean to you well some say that you know it brother bam's gonna have to come back and tie up all these all these loose ends some say that you know we're gonna be uh we're gonna have to go find a giant tent somewhere and meet there uh some say that he had good opinions you know but he had good while he was under prophecy but his opinions weren't any good some say well you can take this part but you have to leave this part out some say you can only quote what was after 1963. some say that you know he was uh he was influenced by the pentecostals and that's why he preached a moving of the spirit in the church some say he was a baptist by origin so that's why he preached you see but what do you say about this message what is it to you as an individual i could ask the name by name luis what is it to you and sister sister what is it to you you see name by name asking what does this message mean to you it's got to be more than just my daddy's religion or my pastor's religion or what what what i just i found a home here and they have love and they maybe they help me out financially it's got to be so much more than that you've got to recognize that this is the christ the son of the living god and upon this rock he has built his church he's not built his church upon branham tabernacle or the name associated with it but he built his church upon the revelation that christ is here that same revelation is laying within our hearts to recognize that jesus is walking among us look to your neighbor and say i see christ i see christ if we're if we don't believe that then why are we why are we believing what we are why are we sacrificing i don't have to pass the mic to ask you you have sacrificed to be in this building this morning you have made sacrifices and you have you have submitted yourself unto the word to be in this building this morning you have you have forsake friends you have forsaken family you have forsaken your own wants your own desires your own temptations you're here this morning somebody just touch yourself and say i'm here i'm here that's a mighty victory because satan would not let you hear unless you overcame something you would not be in this room this morning unless you had already overcome something you might feel that you're weak in faith and you're not gonna make another service but you're here this morning which means there's something greater in you than he that is in the world the spirit of truth brought you here you do not come here of your own accord or because you might think that your mom dragged you in here or your wife might be upset with you if you weren't here this morning but he the spirit of truth has brought you here sometimes we just need to pat ourselves in the back and say i'm still here i may feel weak in faith but i'm still here devil if i'm still here it means i still have breath in my lung and i can change the circumstance that i'm under i can change the situation i am i'm still here to think of it that that before before there ever was a trial we were here before there ever was a headache we were here before there ever was a diabetes we were here before there was cancer we were here before there was a depression we were here and we're still here because we come from somewhere eternal we're not settling for anything less than getting back to eternity i'm not settling for just a simple circuit on this earth given you know 70 80 90 years no i'm going back to eternity but i believe we feel in the air in this time that we're we're under a different dispensation i know you feel it i know we all feel that the the we're being called to a higher level than we were last year than we were the year before we're being called under a different anointing there's there's a different feeling in the air we used to sing this song back in the church there's a feeling in the air and god is everywhere and his resurrection power is moving in this hour that song didn't make any sense to me when i used to sing it 25 years ago but today i recognize there's a feeling in the air his resurrection power is manifesting itself through the body of believers in this hour we're called to be higher than we were last year we're getting called up to believe more than we did last year to to use our faith more than we did last year we can't just rely on some old experience god forbid that we would come to a message church for 15 years and realize we've never been born again god forbid we come and hear the truth a service after service for 20 years and then when they realized that we never really went all the way we never really anchored our soul in that haven of rest god forbid that would happen but you're still here this morning so you have you have the breath to change that situation you have the mindset to say i realize that there is something happening around me that there's a change happening i don't want to miss getting in that in that whirlwind i don't want to miss getting under that anointing i don't want to miss getting under this rapture anointing there's something calling you you know you would not feel that if the lord was not calling you i think we could probably say hey nobody in here wants to miss the rapture anybody here want to miss the rapture there's something in you that's that's that's that's destined the greatest overcoming will be the changing of our bodies that's when you know you've made it that's when you know you made it all the way but we have an earnest expectation of that now we can feel the elements around us changing now we feel the resurrection power moving in the room now we are recognizing that he is here now we're not waiting for something but this is another season right through every age there was a season there was a season under luther and season to pentecost but now we're living under another season it's our season this is your season uh we used to say i hear this song back in the in the old church it's our season to be blessed he's gonna open up the windows he's gonna pour out our blessings it's our season to be blessed when did it become normal for the christian church just to lay back and say hey ah this is not my season to be blessed i've just got to go through this no it's your season for victory somebody say my season my season you were here before the trial you're going through you were in the mind of god before that trial you're going through when when god in his infinite wisdom thought of this time and he thought what it would take to make an overcomer that's when you came into the mind of god before there ever was a time back in the we're talking way back in the mind of elohim you can go back and listen to the adoption series brother branham covers it way back in the mind of elohim when he's thinking of the final final hour where the finishers would finish the work he's thinking of you brother bob he's thinking of you brother error he's thinking of finishers and there we come into the mind of god to be put into this age god did not put you in this age so you could fail god put you in this age and he predestinated you with every resource you need to overcome in this hour everything that you have need of is already laying within you remember brother branham said it everything that we have need of has already been preached it's already been poured out we're not waiting for it to come it's already here but in the right season it comes to life i think we kind of maybe touched on that yesterday you know this the sun in march and the sun in april is not a harvest sun but they're in august but you know the thing about an august sun is it's hot it's really hot and it's hard to stay under that sun it's hard to stay under the anointing it's hard to stay under this word it's hard to give away your headship to this word it's hard to let your flesh fall away and let your own desires fall away and the closer we get to harvest season the hotter that sun gets the hotter that sun causes that seed to come forth out of the shuck the the closer we get but it's in due season right proverbs the 15th chapter would say a man hath joy by the answer of his mouth and a word spoken in due season how good is it to have a word in due season to recognize you're living in the right hour you're living at the right time you have the right word and you are the right person to recognize those things is the key to victory to recognize this is talking about you don't come to me and tell me why i'm weak in faith and you don't know the struggles i've gone through we could pass the mic everybody in here had struggles to get here this morning everybody had to overcome their flesh to get here this morning everybody had to get out of bed tired and soar and they just want to go back to sleep everybody had to overcome something to get here this morning don't tell me about your struggles but tell me that you see yourself in the word overcoming remember in the prayer line something as simple as this brother brandon would have somebody come and he would say i see a dark shadow over you and it's death it's a death sentence but he said don't worry i see you healed on the other side of the line somewhere between here and there i see that dark shadow removing off of you that's our walk with christ somewhere between now and a rapture that dark shadow is being removed off of us we've got to recognize we are the ones walking in that vision it's talking about us we've got to recognize we're living in in the perfect age we're living at the right time that god created us for now we think about it we we want to want to separate things and pull apart things but let me say that you've got to take the whole word you've got to take all of it you've got to take the parts that you don't care for you've got to take the parts that you love you've got to take all the word to get a fullness of a change i believe that's what we're looking for is that all right all right all right so we've laid a foundation right in your season can't be blessed unless you're in your season right israel couldn't be blessed until they were in their land they could be blessed until it was at the right time under the right anointing and the authority was given as soon as they came under that headship of that season we are in a season of rapture this is the season of the manifestation of all things where the sons of god come to fullness of manifestation that's the season that we live in it's not for another age all that was there at pentecost we have that and more you know the thing about azusa street is they didn't have the mechanics that we have today when azusa broke out they had the dynamics in the church but the prophet had not yet come so they did not have the mechanics that we have but it seems like through men and through ages that have gone by that men had kind of wearied away from the the dynamics of the church and they majored on the mechanics and there uh things were where were taught so heavy and taught so deep and it was laying a foundation for what for this hour when the dynamics would come back into the church and now it's not the same don't be afraid that we're going to end up like azusa when azusa opened up the prophet had not yet come but now we have a perfect word and the foundation's been laid and the teaching has been established and the ministry has laid it out waiting for the dynamics to strike i believe we're at that age i believe we're at that time we are turning a corner in this thing you know as as you're building a pyramid you know in in building a house you just lay a wall and then you turn a corner and you lay wall you turn the corner you lay a wall but when you're building a pyramid every time you turn a corner it gets shorter and that wall gets shorter and that corner comes faster and that corner comes faster and faster and faster and as we're getting to the top of this thing we are turning corners from service to service what we believe last year seems uh it's just it's a it's just a a thing of the past but now we are living in the sun the ripening of the seed living in the sun john 16 would say i have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now howbeit when he the spirit of truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you in the amplified it says he shall take of my thoughts and reveal them unto you that's powerful all things that the father hath our mind therefore said i that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you jesus is saying his thoughts are my thoughts i'll not leave you i'll not forsake you i'll be with you even in you i won't lose one of mine all that is his is mine and all that is mine is his a little while and you shall not see me and again a little while you shall see me because i go to the father friends we will not make access to this without the holy ghost without the spirit of truth it's always going to remain head knowledge you can you can decipher it you can break it down you can draw a graph you can you can have a diagram you can do a uh just a parallel uh uh comparison of it but it's always going to stay up here without the holy ghost it's always going to remain up here as a head knowledge unless he the spirit of truth shall come and reveal unto you all things you might know all things in your head but when he comes it's revealed unto your heart then it becomes a reality to you and you know what i'm saying to you is the gospel true because you recognize that same word that same i heard the prophet say that i heard the scriptures say that i recognize that as me i recognize that in my my being it's everything that you are when he the spirit of truth has come but there's only one way to get back there men for 2 000 years have tried to get back access into that even longer than that there when those bloody lambskins were slapping and they tried to get access back into that eternity but you and i are on the threshold of stepping into that eternity of just taking one more step right into that perfect walk with god we're men for for for the beginning of time has tried to get access into that but there's only one way back it's through the message it's not through the the your interpretation of the message it's through the pure word of the message in this hour that is what we are living that's why the devil's trying to steal the power out of the church that's why the devil's trying to keep the holy ghost out of the pulpit am i okay nothing makes me more upset than to hear a preacher come up and try to get the power of the holy ghost out of the pulpit if there's anything that's going to set your kids free it's the power of the holy ghost if there's anything that's going to bring that prodigal back it's the power of the holy ghost if there's anything that's going to make this a living word unto you it is the power of the holy ghost how dare a man come behind the pulpit and try to remove that power from the church you don't need great powerful to discernment to decide whether that's a god-called man or not any ministry that tries to take the holy ghost out of the word is a man's ministry you don't need discernment to decide what's going on here we've got to have the holy ghost in the church without it what are we gathering for without it what are we coming are we singing songs without the power of the holy ghost in here oh my god my i think where would i be without the power of the holy ghost what would i be doing we can we can we could say that we have a discerning spirit but oftentimes we find it's just a critical spirit you know and we'll just compare this quote with that well he missed it there and he misrepresented there but what is he preaching what is he getting to what is he trying to lead you to it you know we get so caught up sometimes i'm making sure the the eyes are dotted and the t's are crossed that we miss the very coming of the son of man that we've missed the very coming of the holy ghost in our midst because we're so concerned with with everything going on around us and you know the pharisees were concerned with the same thing they were so upset that he healed a girl on the wrong day they totally missed the miracle that happened in front of him they totally missed that he healed that girl because it was on the wrong day according to their knowledge they didn't receive the miracle that took place before him god forbid that we would do the same thing to be so caught up under this under this uh uh overtime discernment that we're trying to make sure oh we don't want to we don't want to take a bite of the wrong thing but in the meantime the miracle has come and we've missed it well surely elias must first come he's already come he already showed his signs unto you he already manifested himself unto you and you missed it but i thank god that we have a sure word that we didn't miss it in this hour we didn't miss this coming we didn't miss this day of visitation it's happening right now somebody just passed yourself and say i'm still here i'm still here i didn't miss it i didn't miss it i woke up this morning i thank god i have breath in my lungs i didn't miss it i'm still here i can still receive it i can still get back on track i can get back to life and if you're already walking in the way of life onward christian soldier marching as to war let's take this word and march on not waiting for something to come this is the season for it i don't need you to interpret me god is his own interpreter of his own word i don't need you to tell me where i'm going his word has already told me where i'm going and i see myself in that word it's of no private interpretation i see myself there i'm a written epistle written and read of all men walking in the word that's why we believe this it's not a man's interpretation or inspiration he's already come if you didn't know my father you to know me there's elements within you that were not in generations gone by there's pieces within you that god placed and deposited in this hour whatever they are to change your very elements my me yeah you you weak in faith yeah you you was unsure why you're here yeah you there's something within you that will change the very elements in your body i don't know about you but the older i get the more i look forward to that just one day the anointing will just be caught up we'll be caught up into heavenly places with christ jesus friends it's not a fairy tale it's not a myth but i believe there are some standing here which shall not taste of death but they shall be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye our very bodies will be changed why do we believe what we believe we believe this because we believe in a rapture we believe in the coming of the son of man to change our very bodies into a perfect body i have glorified it and i will glorify it again that's why we believe what we believe you can't give up if you tried i'll not lose one of mine i'll not lose one there's some running as hard as they can god will get them he will not lose one of his he will not leave a hoof behind he will not leave them out in a ditch somewhere but all that is mine will come unto me i tried it brother wade i tried it i tried to run i tried to take off and say hey you can have this religion but something keeps holding me every day i see what is it there's something deposited within you that you can't help but come here you couldn't help but bring yourself to the house of god this morning you can't help but bring yourself under this word you can't help it because there's something within you that's pulling on you it's drawing on you all that coming to me the father has drawn them he's drawing you but what is he drawing you for he's drawing you to walk in the perfect word under a perfect light under a perfect revelation because you're a perfect people my i think the devil does a good job of telling us how how weak we are i think it's time to turn the word around and tell them how strong we are tell them how mighty we are if the weakest christian can get on his knees and every demon runs for cover how about somebody who's positionally placed in the body when when somebody who knows that they're a manifested son of god gets on his knees oh my the very the very devil himself shakes in his boots because he knows we know hey the gig is up you see all this time through time he's not known what's going on with us what keeps driving them i put so many roadblocks in front of brother luis why is he why is he still going what's the deal yeah i guess i'll have to hit him again and here he is i again so many roadblocks in front of zach why is he still here here he is you see he doesn't see what's going on inside you there's another conversation taking place there's another relationship taking place you know he doesn't know he's maybe gathered around here wondering what is the attraction inside inside 6467 main street he doesn't know why we're all gathered in here to him is just a booming thunder and some people getting excited and you know some words being spoken but he doesn't recognize the relationship taking place the transformation taking place what is the attraction on the mountain what is the attraction inside this little tabernacle in here this morning you see to him it just looks like uh you're just you're gonna fail tomorrow as hard as you did yesterday but to you and i there's another conversation taking place that we know where we're going we know how we're going to get back there we know by faith he will see us through he's not going to forsake us he's not going to leave us he's not going to just put us on the side of the road but the prescription is the same it was back in the upper room if we can get in one mind one accord the same thing will happen and we wonder sometimes why we don't have a revival in our life that's the same prescription that it was back there in the upper room by one mind one accord it will be the same but you see you've got to recognize the season we're in we're coming into a rapture season this is the season of life this is the season where we're going to make manifest and show our colors of what we are was the theme of the year whatever it is let it out this is the season to let it out you're going to let out your fruit no matter what it is if it's false you're going to let it out if it's a true fruit you're going to let it out if it's a manifested son of god you're going to let it out the sun is ripening over the seed it's going to let it out it's going to come out it's going to bring forth the life that's within it that's the only way you can tell what kind of tree it is it'll produce it it'll make the hard choices it'll make the heart changes in your life god it's hard sometimes to follow under this anointing but ramp said i labor to stay under this anointing so that i can see where the message is today take that home and think about it see where it is today right now where is that anointing right now i want to get under it i don't want to just come to church and realize that i spent 50 years of my life sitting in a pew and it didn't mean anything why come this far and give up now why come all this way and just turn it away now why not just take the next step and enter all the way in to that shekinah glory where you know you're secure you're anchored you're going home it's as good as it's as good as getting on the train that ticket is just as good as stepping on the train it's the earnest of it excuse me but there's something within us we cannot deny it as that sun begins to move over us it begins to come out here a few months ago i was uh i was at brother schumacher's church remember the shoemaker up in pennsylvania and at the time i happened to be there they have a sugar shack right and they make syrup and the time i was there was a syrup day so the day before church we had spent the we spent the day in the sugar shack and they were boiling it and boiling it and they have this big sophisticated machine and they pour this sap into there and it takes all the sap and it boils it down to this chamber and boils it down to that chamber i don't know if honey's made the same or how it's made something like that but they come down it comes down and comes down and by the time it comes out you open the valve and it's syrup and it's good but you see through the course of the process all of the impurities were boiled out through the course of pouring that sap into there all of the impurities were boiled and boiled and transferred and boiled and transferred and boiled and he's got an automated setup when that thermometer hits 122.4 degrees the valve opens and now comes syrup god knows what he's doing he's not left you on the fire too long he knows what he's doing he's boiling out all of the impurities until you can make sweet syrup when all the impurities are gone then it's time to open the valve but you see there's some intelligence within that tree that pushes the sap up i thought it was pretty remarkable maybe i'm just dumb but i thought it was pretty remarkable there's there's an intelligence within that tree that they tap that tap into that tree and there it is all year and there's no sap coming out of it all winter no sap no sap leaves are gone no life seemingly in the tree but then there's a change of season in that old winter frost begins to die off and that old frost begins to fall off the tree and that sun begins to show itself there there in northern pennsylvania there's some there's some winter times where you don't see the sun that sun begins to show itself again it begins to crest over the hill and that tree something within that tree knows it's time to produce life it's time to push the sap up out of the roots and up into the tree what what intelligence told that tree to do that it's built in it where was that sap all winter so if you're a tree you be a tree with me for a minute if you're a tree in northern pennsylvania and there you all this time of year you're beautiful and you're green and oh my you've just produced your harvest and it's just a wonderful time and but then there's a change in the air and the sun's not coming up as early as it used to and your leaves begin to change color and they begin to fall and they begin to wither and there you were a beautiful tree and all of a sudden now there's barely a leaf on you nothing there just a just a dry old branch and that sun hides its face you don't see that sun much anymore but then all of a sudden there's a change in the air all of a sudden there's another wind blowing by and you feel a little bit of warmth in the air and you feel a little bit of different difference in the air and you feel that the pressure in the altitude is changing the pressure in the atmosphere is changing there's there's a difference happening you can't help but produce leaves you can't help it but where was that life the whole winter where was that life all winter long it was down in the roots it was down inside those roots and at the right time under the right season under the right anointing that life comes out of those roots and begins to pop forth life leaves fruit leaves fruit leaves fruit seems like overnight a tree will just bloom into a full full leaves what is it there's a life inside of it that knows it's time to produce i believe the church is coming to that time of life where we know it's time to produce where maybe our sap's been down in the roots for years and years but there's a changing of the sun it's time to produce the fruit it's time to produce the life it's already within you the intelligence within you tells you what is it it's he the spirit of truth he's saying it's time to produce it it's time to produce it it's the hour for it don't hold it back it's the hour for it it's the time you want a quote on this sure okay the roman caterpillar started eating on that bride tree and took it all the way to the roots cut it all the way back everything cut the tree right off like he did christ the bridegroom cut the bride right down and started out in creeds and denominations the same old bug but what all glory but in its roots was the predestinated seed in our roots is a predestinated seed mine that does something to me because it tells me i'm gonna make it in my roots there's a predestinated seed the royal seed of abraham it could not die though you couldn't feel it sometimes it could not die though you didn't know it was there it could not die even though you didn't see it working it could not die there's a predestinated seed within you that cannot die satan can't have it he doesn't have access to it there's something greater within you the devil can't touch it the word was in the roots with the promise now i wish i would have given him my quote to put up the word was in the roots with the promise i will restore saith the lord all the years that the caterpillar cut off all the locusts eating all the rest of the bugs eat up i will restore it back thus saith the lord my that should do something to us i will restore all the years that you've just been a good church sinner i'll restore all the years that you feel the devil is taken from your joy and giving you depression and taking you out of the out of the life and the love of god i will restore all the years back unto you it's a promise it's laying within you the life is already in you rapturing faith is not going to come into you it's already in you but under the right season and dispensation it draws it out of us it draws it up out of us those years that you spent playing around with the devil he'll restore those years it's drawing it up out of you it's the drawing power of the word my goodness to think you probably did not wake up and look at yourself in the mirror this morning and think i'm a spiritual king i'm a king of a kingdom if you're like me look at the mirror but what does god see what is that life in you produce my why are we believing this friends it's just some rules that make us feel good some good morals for our kids to live by this is resurrection power it's in the word it's in our roots that's why we believe it's down in there sometimes you can't feel it sometimes you're unaware it's there but that life is in your roots just get out of the anointing long enough for it to come up and let it blossom and let it manifest itself and you'll be able to say i know i'm a spiritual king now i'm a king and priest now i know i have adoption authority now i know i'm walking in step with the word my you're a prophecy you're gonna come to pass god forbid that somebody else down the street would be able to say i am the lulu revival right some somebody from africa fly over here and say hey brother wade where's the lulu revival i'm the lulu revival you're looking at it this is where it is this is where it's happening don't say oh so-and-so is here you ought to meet so and so he's on fire i am the revival happening in lula georgia we've got to recognize this is happening in our midst this is an event we're not waiting for an event to come the event has already come this is the rapture us taking the word in fullness eating the book becoming the word living it out my i think it should be more than just a just a nice quote that makes you feel good but it should be a life lived not just on sunday morning when you feel good but through the week of life lived that if he should come he's coming for you if he should come tonight he's coming for you if he should come right now he's coming for you a life lived to know there's a relationship there my there's such a love i don't want to i would i would i'd rather die than hurt the lord that kind of love remember brother man would say i don't when i leave overseas i don't you know my wife doesn't say now now now bill you will not talk to another woman you will not you will not fellowship with another woman you won't write letters to another woman no he said but our love is so strong that it's not spoken like that she knows that i love her so much that i wouldn't dare do anything to hurt her how about our relationship with the lord does he know that about you does he know that your relationship is so he's already proven his love he's already proven that he cares more for you than his own life what about you have you shared the same kind of love with your savior have you shared now this might just be simple preaching but have you shared that with him you love him so much you would rather die than hurt him i love this so much i'd rather i'd rather cease to breathe than hurt him where his where his victory you quoted it yesterday where is victory we're not we're not just the crown cast at his feet we're on the throne we're there with him we are his victory we're his bride we're we're we're but sometimes we don't realize how important we are in this in this realm my the devil's got us so beat up sometimes we just barely mope our way into church man remember brother brandon would cover it and then uh he'd say he'd say they just write about praying and fasting praying fast praying fast he said why do they just write about praying fast much like the the disciples of john remember the pharisees came to jesus and they said why do john's disciples fast and pray and we're fasting and praying but yet your disciples are eating and drinking with you my that makes me happy because i know what class i'm in i'm not sad i'm not worried i'm not moping my way in here but how could you be sad when the bride is dining with the bridegroom we're with him we're one we're fellowshipping with him where he he said they they write those things because they have not realized the awakening of the bride i've been awakened not a false woke out there this is the real awakening in this hour we have been awakened to realize that the word is becoming manifest in you many of you have been in here longer than i've been alive all of those years of teaching has come up to this moment in time that you could realize all of that foundation is coming to life in this hour all of that word that's been poured in and poured in and poured in is coming to life in this hour under this season you are walking in prophecy i don't know if there's monitors but if i could get a little bit you're walking in prophecy and that prophecy has a voice right she will be the final voice to the final age that prophecy has a voice he would say then take that bucket of water set it at a post out there and see if nature will run it down and in the fall of the year and bring it back in the spring no sir what is it now aside it's god's provided way it only operates the way god provides for it a little voice says get down to the roots and down it goes now it does that without any intelligence what what are we to do by the same god speaking to us we but we got a right to refuse it or to accept it and mostly we refuse it he says but a tree remember you agreed to enter in with me we're pretending to be trees for a minute but a tree can't refuse a tree only knows one routine and that's to obey its master it cannot refuse when the sun goes away the life drops into the roots to preserve it right now when the sun comes back that life must must come up out of those roots and bring forth fruit it's the hour that we're living in it's the time that we're in we're not gonna be don't don't be trouble that you're gonna run out of gas at the finish line god did not bring you all the way this far just to leave you there at the line brother he didn't bring you out of whatever you came out of just to leave you right here at this time he brought you to be a finisher he brought you to lay aside every weight that has so easily beset us and run the race that is set before us with the gospel [Music] this is why i believe what i believe i'm not interested in just hearing uh good thoughts or a good sermon i want life i want to see life it's what's inside of me i can't help but produce it i can't help it i'm a tree i can't refuse it i've got to produce a life i'm a living son of god my sometimes the devil would look at us and say living i'm a living son of god i produce the fruit of which i'm talking about i know what i'm talking about i know that this message works i know this message works when you have nobody else to lean on it when you don't know where else to go and when you're so confused in your mind i know this message works i know this message works when you're just a hypocrite sitting on the front pew saying amen just like everybody else i know this message works i know this message works when you're out drunk on the street and you don't know your own name i know this message works i know what i'm talking about this is life how would where would we be without it where would we be without the grace of god and to think sometimes we let him sit in the corner with dirty feet on because we're so concerned with some my goodness here a while back i was out uh uh at my my dad's uh uh dedication meetings or not dedication but what do you call that 10th anniversary and uh we i didn't get a haircut in town so i went to get a haircut there where he's at it was a little rough barber shop you know it's just you know hey what's up yeah homie you know at the barbershop and i'm just getting ready to preach you know well they had this this game on and it was the the warriors versus the cavaliers right and i'm like it's not basketball season well come to find out it was the championship in 2015. the warriors vs the cavaliers and they were they were watching this and the guys were stopping cutting hair and watching it like they didn't know who was going to win and they had the attention of everybody in the room because it's overtime there's less than two minutes left this is the final capstone of the game one way or the other the game's over and everybody's just looking and i'm like hey i gotta go can you finish cutting my hair and the guy's looking at two minutes left two minutes left but the game's already happened they already know who's gonna win and then they pan outside and they show the the stands there the fans that couldn't make it into the into the coliseum and there they are in cleveland i think and there's people going bananas there's people going nuts and they're they're turning over cars and they're jumping off roofs and they're they're shouting and they're doing backflips and it's about a rubber ball that maybe will go into that hoop and they're cheering on some guy who sold his soul for 120 million dollars to throw a rubber ball inside a hoop but yet the the living god will come into our midst and he will perform signs and wonders and miracles and change hearts and lives and he'll barely get up barely get a hand raise god forbid that we would leave him in the corner with dirty feet i don't want to be guilty of leaving any praise left out on the field ah this is game time this is the super bowl hour this is the capstone ministry it's not time to hold back praise it's time to let it out now don't be guilty of holding that within you and say oh i'll do it another day i'll do it another time you may not get another time me my wife we're just reflecting this morning that uh was it three years ago today two years ago today we were we were in a wedding of a young couple some of our best friends just a few months ago they were taken off the scene both at once by an explosion 21 and 22 years old you are not promised next sunday you are not promised the next meeting you are not promised this week this this midweek service you are not promised to walk out of those doors but while there's life in the room why don't you go ahead and recognize it and say i receive of that life i see it i take it i want it how dare we leave jesus in the corner we're no better than any pharisee if we leave him in the corner with dirty feet we've got to recognize he's here the messiah is amongst us he's walking amongst us remember we're not azusa street we have the mechanics but we must have the dynamics together god forbid that we would leave him in the corner he's knocking on the outside why am i not being worshipped in there why am i not being praised i i'm coming to deliver and you won't let me in he's not only knocking on the church door he's knocking on the individual heart i'm coming to deliver why won't you let me in there's only one way you're going to get back to life is to let me in there is to let me in and i'll eradicate sin i'll eradicate the devil i'll remove any condemnation i'll remove any regret just let me in let me in that's why i get so excited about this it's passion it's my life cause i know where i was when i let him in i know what kind of condition i was in when i decided to let him in you know brother branham said that you'll not change the way you praise the way that you worship him here is exactly how you worship him over there so if you're waiting for some glorious angel to come and you see him coming down you're not going to change the way that you praise you're not going to change the way you praise when you recognize him coming in his his corporal body you're not going to change the way you praise when we're on the other side and we're saying we're resting on that you're going to praise exactly like you praise him now [Applause] for some of us we just got to realize we've got the praise we've got the worship within us i was down here with these young people last night they got the praise within them sometimes we just got to let it out sometimes just gotta let out the praise and say i'll glorify the lord let every breath that i have be used to glorify the lord i can send you quotes to back all this up if you want it later but how dare a cavalier fan praise louder than me how dare i be more concerned with what's going on in this temporal world than concerned with what's going on right here while he's on the scene right here what are we what are we clemson fans in here bulldogs how dare we be more concerned up in ohio it's the buckeyes in the in the wolverines right the big rivalry when they're playing together a whole town shuts down you can't get somebody to come to church what is it the god of the civil age has taken the attention off of the of the word and he's put the eyes on something else i say there's only one way back to life you can have that life or you can have this life i choose this life i choose life eternal to know where i'm going it's more than ink on a page to me it's life and life abundantly that's what we've been promised in this hour god don't need my reasoning about it you don't need my think i don't have a thing coming god wants the word the word only he wants people who will take the word just as it's preached and manifest it just as it was spoken i say it's us is anybody with me to say it's me i want to manifest this word with everything that's within me let me become a living reality of this message let somebody don't have to ask where the revival's at they'll see me and say there's the revival there it is it's happening in the church but the pharisees were so concerned with how it was done they missed the coming of it they missed the come they were looking for it brother bob they were looking for him to come their whole thing they were studying over the scrolls they knew him front to back they could quote you every word of isaiah but they missed him even when he came and identified himself in front of them and he comes down off the mountain and he opens the scroll and he turns the book of isaiah they knew it like the back of their hand but he's showing this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears i say we have the same word of prophecy in this day this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears he's showing us the time that we're living in is a rapture time don't hold back and wait for some other age this is the last stage don't wait for another revival to come through this is the bride's revival the move is on for the bride we are walking in the last move we are living in the last wave of god he's saving maybe for the last time don't be guilty of missing it because you can't get out of some tradition or can't get off your high horse paul was knocked off his high horse we can't dwell on an old experience we can't dwell on something that happened to us all in the night he saved me 30 years ago praise the lord where is he today i was driving down the road down here and the lord just gave me a phrase and i wrote it down i didn't know why he said when's the last time and i started thinking about i said when's the last time i just had a good old holy ghost shouting fit when's the last time i let the holy ghost come down and just ignite my soul my sometimes i think we we forget what it's like to have joy in our soul we forget what it's like to be free we forget what it's like just to worship the lord not caring about what anybody thinks not caring about what your wife might think or your husband might think when's the last time you let the lord have his way in your life when's the last time you let him activate that life within you it's laying in there when's the last time you let it happen but those promises are laying in the church in the roots and at the appointed time he'll bring him forth what time in my day of visitation we're here this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears i like that it didn't say in brother branham's ears or justin branham tabernacle or the pentecostage ears but this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears somebody will take this word and will manifest it in their life it's going to be me somebody will take this prophet's prophecy and fulfill it it's going to be me somebody will walk in this prophecy all the way to a body change it's going to be me where's your faith this morning to say i fulfill that word this day this scripture is fulfilled in my ears it's my season for it i've been appointed for it there's only one way i'm going to get there everybody so tore up about the vaccines and shots in this age let me say i'm not for or against it but there's only one shot that you absolutely absolutely must have and that is the spirit of truth without that shot you will not even see what i'm talking about the teaching that you hear the preaching that you hear the the conviction that you feel you will not understand it unless you have that shot we'll not get it without the holy ghost that's why the devil's trying so hard to keep it out of the pulpit that's why the devil's trying to say we can't preach that we can't preach that they'll think you're fanatic well you're going to be a fanatic for somebody i'd much rather be guilty of being a fanatic for the holy ghost being a fanatic to know that once i was lost in sin all but jesus set me free what's satan have you bound but jesus set me free how could we cease but to praise him all of our life is doing my every breath that we have should be used to praise him but we spent more of our breath talking about how bad our circumstance is oh what was me remember brother julie you said wowzy wowzy woof let your testimony be negative always positive that's a direct quote not mind over matter not psychology not choo choo train mentality i think i can i think i can but to know no matter what's going on in this in this season this dimension down here there's another me out there that's rejoicing that's praising that shouting to think that i already have an earnest of it don't let your heart be troubled neither be afraid that rapturing faith that you're wondering right now if you possess it brother man said don't worry it'll be there it'll be there he says it twice don't worry it'll be there it'll be there don't worry about it neither let your heart be troubled it's already in you predestinated resources to overcome in this hour predestinated fake to overcome in this hour at the right season it comes out of the tree and where does the fruit ripen last at the top of the tree when the sun is just over the top a capstone now we know where we're at this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears but you can't get there you will not produce that fruit unless the same life is laying within you i believe it's in there but it's got to be activated right but the man would talk about that gene seed laying in the church waiting to be activated there's only one way back to life it's not from a coveted shot it's not from a yellow fever shot it's from a holy ghost booster shot if you don't have it get the initial shot if you already have it get a booster those are exact quotes you can go back and research it get a booster of the holy ghost there's only one way back to life amen and it's through the holy ghost it's through his spirit of truth it's through him dividing it unto us giving it unto us ministering unto us this is your portion here's your inheritance here's your inheritance but the ramp said joshua represented that still small voice inside you which is the holy ghost here's your inheritance here's your inheritance here's yours yours you want your kids you want health here's yours you want salvation for your loved ones here's yours you want you want to know him and experience him in power here's yours here's your inheritance you want to have joy here's your inheritance you want to know what it's like just to feel and brush by here's your inheritance he's passing out his inheritance it's the holy ghost we've all got something to overcome no matter how holy you think you are no matter how close to it you live you were born under the same nature that everybody else was born under but there comes a time when that nature must be defeated we're living in that hour we're living in that time it only comes one way one way back to life you know i was driving down the road some months ago and just uh just kind of how the lord works with me i'll just be driving sometimes not even thinking on something that just a line will drop in and it'll turn into a 20-page sermon you might think well you're not doing a very good job but that's just the way the lord built me so i i got i got an inspiration to look up anti-venom anybody you know here ain't here know how anti-venom's made i knew a little bit about it but i really didn't know about it so i just google it sorry i just google it an antivenom is made by them injecting a snake whether it be let's just say it's a rattlesnake what kind of snakes do we have down here rattlesnakes let's just say it's a rattlesnake antavinifer rattlesnake is made by them injecting that snake's venom into an animal and then that animal absorbs that venom into its bloodstream and the intelligence that's already in that animal begins to create an antibody and those antibodies begin to attack that venom and attack that venom until it becomes a cure against that venom something already in the animal has been put there to fight off the venom we say well what does that have to do with us we were born under a serpent nature all injected with the same venom but until we get the antivenom that venom is circulating through our blood but there was once a sacrifice that took that venom within itself you know how they get that antivenom out of that animal those antibodies they cut that animal and they bleed it out and those antibodies come out through that blood when they they force it out and that's what you get injected when you get antivenom shot but 2 000 years ago there was a shot given there was a venom injected into a sacrifice and that sacrifice was pierced by a roman soldier and they began to bleed him out and as he bled out my antivenom was in that holy ghost my antivirus was in that spirit that poured out and without it you will always walk in partial victory how many years ready for a full victory how many is here tired of the devil telling you what you can and cannot do how many how many's tired of the devil beating you up telling you that you're only going to make it this far i've taken the shot i took the antibodies i know you're already defeated i know the same antibodies that took your keys as living inside me he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world he the spirit of truth is laying in you waiting for you to recognize and activate him how many times have we let the devil come by and step on us take from us rob from us wake up on the wrong side of the bed and there goes our joy the wife says something to us there goes our joy bill comes in there goes our joy how many times the devil come in and taking your joy from you we talked about it yesterday with the kids i went to the enemy's camp and i took back what he stole from me whose joy was it to begin with yours whose victory was it to begin with yours you are his victory it was yours to begin with my goodness to think that we've let the devil come in and rob us and rob us when we have kingdom authority when we have a more sure word of prophecy to think that we can every giant should fall before us every sickness would fall before us i just heard the prophet say he said if we could ever get the church to believe this in fullness and to be in one mind and one accord there wouldn't be one sick person among us it's time for self-examination i'll do my part self-examine i'll do my part i'm gonna get rid of all the flesh that i can see i'm to hack it away with a word i'm going to shave off every bit of this cardinality every bit of unbelief every bit of doubt i'm going to hack it away brother louise are you do your part brother wade you do your part we're going to do our part everybody self-examine yourself and say there should not be one sick amongst us there should not be one feeble amongst us there should not be one depression amongst us if we believe this word in fullness then receive of all of its benefits but have we recognized that messiah is walking amongst us without recognizing he's here we do not receive of his benefits but i recognize he's not coming he's not back there he is here he's here my goodness cut a bunch of this out we'll try to he didn't put us here to leave us he put us here to bring forth fruit he's got a seed down here in the root like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water he that takes god's laws and love in his heart he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water his leaves shall not wither in his season somebody say season in his season he'll bear his fruit somebody say his fruit his fruit in his season that's our season that's our time in our season we will bear our fruit we will bear the fruit of the word that's been planted in there that's my identity it's not this flesh you see out here there's another me in there that you can't see and his season is here his fruit is here his time is here the bride's already restored we're not waiting for it to come we're not waiting the loose ends have already been tied together friends if you're waiting for some more loose ends to come every vision has already been fulfilled hope we're in agreement on that it's already been fulfilled we're waiting for him to come back we're waiting for this ministry to ride this trail again and i believe it's doing it now through a quick short work the miracles of god are coming to pass we're witnessing just a few weeks ago i was in mexico and there was a uh just a supernatural event that took place in the way it happened and there was an impromptu prayer line that came through and in that prayer line i saw hernias retracted i saw thyroid gorters just retracted the symptoms gone prodigals run in the back door and run and give their hearts back to the lord what is it it's a season for it it's the season for the bride's manifestation i'm not waiting for it it's already here not waiting all when i can get myself there it's already here don't miss your hour of visitation it's already amongst us recognize who you are he's not coming back for a broke body not coming back for a freak bride but somebody who knows where they stand i may be weak in my flesh but i know where my faith is i may be weak in my mind but i know where my faith lies it's more than just a hope it's a surety i'm anchored in that rock we've got to be so sure this is not a time to question i'm a closer this is not a time to question what you believe in not a time to wonder if this is really the truth a time to back up and say i'm not well i'm just not sure this is not a time for that this is the finish line this is the hour of his visitation this is the time when he's coming and say will i find faith when i come this is not the time to back up on what you believe he didn't bring you this far to leave you where you're at now this is not the time to retreat but we must have the faith of gideon although we're weary although we want to just lay down and let somebody else do it we can't because there's something within us that says pursue pursue go after him go after him pursue the enemy pursue him out of your home pursue him out of your marriage pursue him out of your kid's relationship pursue him out of your mind battles pursue him out of your addictions pursue him out of your faults pursue this is the hour for it he's given us the strength within us my i think it's it's mighty that we are given the hour of when she'll speak and if she speaks she's got to have breath within her where did that life come from breath all life comes from god he's the breath you know i saw something uh i was at uh uh brother ron's in the back office there a few months ago and he shared with me this video clip that this this lady was describing and when moses thought to ask god what his name was he answered you know we added the yahweh in there but the original hebrew translation is yw hw and so this linguistic lady broke it down she said it wasn't really a word it was an action it was a verb when moses thought to ask what the name of elohim was he answered with an action he she said that linguistics said that it would be the exact letters that moses would pin to pin the action of breathing to think that life itself testifies that there's a god testifies every baby that's born in this world the first thing it does is testify of god every person that goes out of this world the last thing they do is testify of god he's the breath in our lungs he's the reason we sing he's the reason we praise let everything that hath breath praise ye the lord how dare we use our breath for any other purpose and but to praise the lord he is the life behind us that's what gives us a voice authority in this age is the breath of elohim it's in our lungs it's in our body it's in this word it's coming forth the action of breathing is here why just take a breath there he is there he is i don't know about you when the holy ghost comes by me i just i feel that something's different in my lungs oh he's here i can feel him in the air i can feel a change in the atmosphere i can feel something's different i'm breathing in life he came to the prophet with the same temptation he's laying before you look at this you spent your life serving him he's taking your wife he's taking your baby you've got nothing yeah you're right all those hours you spent preaching to those people all those hours laboring doesn't even mean anything yeah maybe you're right you know he he maybe he didn't never heal nobody maybe you just make believe that yeah maybe don't tell me that our prophet wasn't honest with us about the struggles that he went through it's the same temptation yeah maybe you're just going to church because it makes you feel good and maybe there's no truth to this yeah maybe you know what there's not even a god no you've gone too far devil you've gone too far i feel him in my lungs i feel the life within me i feel that there's something inside me that that you didn't give to me that you didn't produce there's a greater life within me i'm breathing his life he is live he's breath he's he's everything that i am and if you lied to me about that you lied to me about it he is a healer he is a savior he is a redeemer he is a restorer he is a liberator he is our release he is our joy he is our freedom if you lied to me about that that you lied about everything else he's the breath sometimes we just got to stop and take a breath it's god there's a god in the room he can change every you're here somebody pat yourself and say i'm still here i'm right here devil you haven't got me yet i can change the circumstance that i'm living in there's breath in my lung it's the action of living and the hand of the lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones and caused me to pass by then ran about and behold there were very very many open in the valley and lo they were very dry and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and i answered oh lord god thou knowest again he said unto me prophesy unto these bones and say unto them oh ye dry bones hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord god unto these bones behold i will cause breath to enter into you and ye shall live that's our prophecy in this hour he will cause breath to enter into you and you will live eternally his breath does not have an expiration date on it his breath is alive it's moving in the bride it's speaking it's prophesying it's it's it's fulfilling the word of this hour okay can i have a little liberty the group that sing that song would you all come back up and sing it just now is that okay let's just sing that song when i heard that song strike i i knew why the lord had me turn this direction you may feel that you're a dry bone but that's not the end of your story he said i say unto you that i will cause breath to enter into you and ye shall live that's thus saith the lord what more sure word do you want what more sure where do you need it doesn't get any better than that the president united states would come in here and say hey you're going to be all right don't mean a thing the greatest doctor in the world could say we'll preserve you for years and years to come don't mean a thing but you have thus saith the lord his breath is already in you my friends to think god almighty thought so much of you without so much of me how could we let him sit in the corner with dirty feet let me just finish this point while you guys get ready that woman that came into that simon's house was bearing the same condemnation that we all bear feeling unworthy feeling unwanted feeling that there was no way for us feeling that we'd send away our day of grace feeling that somehow we're just gonna miss it all together and it's just gonna come right by us but she couldn't just sit back and let it happen without her making her best effort and there she comes that house just put yourself in her shoes it's not hard for us to do because we're there and she's walking in that house of simon dragging her weight there he is across the room oh my how it hurt her to see he was just there with dirty feet i can't believe they're not washing his feet i can't believe they're not worshiping him the king of kings has come down and they're letting him sit there with dirty feet i must go on she drags her condemnation and then she gets closer to that anointed one that chain begins to fall the chain begins to fall as she approaches him all she can do is just fall at his feet she didn't hold anything back for the next race that was her race she didn't hold anything back to say i'm just going to reserve a little bit but she poured all that she had out on his feet and sometimes we feel so unworthy to even wash his feet we feel so unworthy to entertain the presence of an angel we think who are we but you know god knew that that was going to happen and the prophet said that he predestinated her with everything that she had need of to worship him he said she had me to do him a service it was within her heart to do him a service but she had nothing to do it with so god provided the towels he provided the towels and the water go ahead and take a breath who provided that oh friends this might be simple to you but god forbid we let him sit in the corner promised to be here so if he's here it's your duty it's your desire it's your passion it's your life to worship don't hold back a little bit of oil this might be the last mile of the race don't hold back just a little bit of praise this might be everything this might be it this praise that you let out this morning might be your prodigal coming back in the door i've seen it happen too many times i could give testimony after testimony of it this final breath might be the one don't let it go by stay under that anointing while it's here thank you lord [Music] um [Music] there's so much we have lost as we look down the road where all the prodigals have walked and one by one the enemy has

brother a good hand we pray for his ministry we pray for his family he's fixing to have another baby sister felice we'll pray for her too i just i hope all mines are clear because there's there's there's this it's just like a a bath we just took them we've all took a bath if you want your cleanness washed away now's the time to do it uncleanness washed away now's the time to do it don't leave without having the lord we're not promised tomorrow right that's that's that that's why the the impression of the other day reading those names and how many other ministers have we've seen that that are calling out for for their children that are wayward their husbands and their wives it's time to get in the ark we've had 60 years since the prophet's been gone and he said the rapture was overdue in the 60s here we are in 2022 almost 20 23. it's about time for us to get in the ark because the door's gonna shut and when it does it doesn't matter what your mama's name is your daddy's name is it doesn't matter it does matter who your daddy's name is yes if your daddy's named the lord jesus you're going to be on that like i said before this is not a cruise ship we own we own a battleship hey man this is not this is not just easy but guess what what did moses do moses the bible says traded the wealth of the world and he could have been in egypt had all the women he wanted had all the graves he could have been fanned for the rest of his life and never had to do a thing but the bible says he forsook that right right yep he forsook that to become a mud dauber he forsooked that to lead a group of rebels that gave him heartburn for 40 years right hello somebody gave him heartburn for 40 years murmuring complained but he said we have a promise we're going across god gave me a commission to get you guys out now we're going to get you in the promised land we thank god for a commission that he's given us hey brother ronnie said we're going to the promised land somebody's going to make it we're the one who's going to make it hey man you just got to believe you're the one we got to have faith amen you love the lord just remember brother aaron wednesday afternoon and brother luis and brother bob will be speaking this weekend uh pray for sister june now we're leaving thursday going to ohio uh we're going to dedicate brother isaac's new house up there and we're gonna have service with them and fellowship with them a few days so just keep us in prayer and we'll keep you in prayer and then the next wednesday i'll be preaching some of the other brothers will be going to the men's meeting the next weekend so we've got a few things still going on but but i like to see a church on the move doing things for the youth doing things for everybody everybody pitching in and doing what they need to do and and and if you're uncomfortable today then the lord help you if you're uncomfortable it's because of the devil it ain't ain't because of god it's because the devil that you're uncomfortable i want him to be uncomfortable i think he got so nervous at the first of this service that he left the building amen when the spirit of god came down during the song service and then he can't stand the word he can take he can hang around a little bit with a little bit of shouting and praising he's used to that but he ain't used to the word coming word by word he used to he ain't used to it coming through human flesh though but that's what god said he was gonna do he was gonna defeat the devil through me and you that's why we're his victory that's right that's why he put so much into us he put so much listen he had faith didn't brother brown say he had faith brother brown said jesus had faith in who he was god had faith and when he said let there be it was going to happen so now we got a little part of that inside of us called the holy ghost to give us that faith that we've been talking about so god bless you we love you with the love of the lord let's buy our heads we're going if you want to fellowship downstairs that's fine if you want to go get something to eat that's fine we're going to probably hang around a little bit and we'll probably take the preacher out deep and and go somewhere in fellowship but thank you for the whole weekend thank you for everything you've done we appreciate brother dale and sister dale for giving us the opportunity to be able to do this amen and i do want to thank one lady in this church which is unnamed and i don't know who she is and i'm not a gossiper so i don't really care who it was for paying for the food yesterday and and she's um one of the congregation but she she gave us 250 dollars more than that because she said the pizza was more than that she paid more than that oh dude she really exactly enough okay well the pizza was like 258 or 60 or something dollars so so she gave more than that so um thank you for that sister whoever you are doesn't matter god knows and that's all right that's all the lord knows who it is and you'll get back tenfold times that so i'm never worried about god you know me out giving god right he's in that he's going to out give all of us so let's bow our heads the heavenly father thank you for the service you give us my what a resurrection that was the prophet said but oh what a resurrection this was today out of dark crees and denominations out of out of cancer and out of thyroid trouble and out of nervousness and out of um fathers being out of control and kids being wayward and and little hattie wright come up here for prayer said i want my husband saved oh praise god amen praise god do that sometime lord when when you're here lord i pray that we'll grasp hold of that and not let you go jacob wouldn't let you go until you blessed him yes you wrestled with a man and he wrestled we can't wrestle two hours he wrestled half a night but you finally let go but you gave him a little gift he walked a little different than what he did before he was now called israel the limping prince well father if i have to limp the rest of my days to know that you've blessed me lord that's all right i pray that you'll be your brother ronnie and sister police and the family lord as they travel on um tomorrow to go back home we pray that you'll give them traveling mercies lord give him strength today father he poured his heart out to us lord now i
