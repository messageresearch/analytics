rest of it toward the marriage and divorce part after you're married what's going to go on if if if certain things certain things transpire but keep in the back of your mind really honestly truly being a Christian there's no such thing as a divorce right amen no such thing as divorce I mean we're we were always we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world we know all these other things happened down here that he divorced Israel and Mar what that that happened a long time ago right we were always his bride amen that's right we weren't not his bride and then we become his bride yeah down here in the Gentile age we did but now as far as in his mind he always had a s he that's one he was looking for the whole time all right so just keep that in your mind and as as Brother D brings the U the series on marriage and divorce let's turn to Ephesians 5 and read the scripture here and we'll make a few announcements while you're turning to the scripture or looking on the board remember to uh coming up next month that's already announced but may the 19th there be a fellowship meeting of brother pageant we plan on going for Lord willing May the 6 June and I will be that

and the ones that are wanting to go to witch time we need to plan on going and not wait 5 minutes before we leave the plan we need to start making plans now same thing with downstairs Richard has made us a um a sign up sheet for the Financial Peace University class that we're going to start in July if you're going to attend you need to put that down because we need to start ordering the kits for it even though now we can get a better discount now than when we wait till till we get closer to it so uh the Lord bless each and every one of you in that and then remember June 14th 15th and 16th we'll have the um annual third annual fishing trip for all the the young men and and all the adult men in the church so just keep that in your prayers we'll start planning it and getting it ready I think we kind of know that one kind of comes together pretty good so we we've got that one down path so let's go to the Lord in prayer and ask him to bless Heavenly Father we pray that you'd be with us Lord just one more time Lord you've put us on this Earth Lord to be an example for you father and I know that we fail you every day but Lord there has to be a time that we come together under this present day truth that we have that you told us what to do you've you've instructed us on the things that we need to do you've instructed us us on things to help our life you've instructed us on things to help our finances you you've given like you did the children of Israel Lord you've given us a lot of things but sometimes we turn them away sometimes we commit iniquity because we were born in sin shaped in iniquity spouse from our mother's womb a liar but Heavenly Father you saw Grace and sent a sent your son Lord to take care of that to put us under that bleach blood that made us Lord Justified us Sanctified and filled us with the Holy Ghost and made us children of God lord we have to look to that Lord the author and finisher of our faith the one that did it all for us Lord so now as we live under your blood father you still give us things that we're supposed to do Lord you gave us Commandments and you gave us promises and things to to go by and walk thereby you gave us rulers and governors Lord to to teach us and and give us Lord admonition and father we pray today Lord that you would just come and just give us Lord the words the say to the people and may it be said in in the honest of our heart let it be taken in the honest of Heart Lord take it and study it and and live it Lord and and Lord we know we have to be in this body Lord until we're changed or till death will set us free so we have to learn to live in this body we know that it was that it commits sin every day you said through the prophet we'll read it in just a little while Lord that we sin every day but father you gave us an advocate you covered our sins Lord and not just covered them this time you've totally eradicated them Lord but it's got to come through the word of God not just being Lord lip service it's got to come from a knowledge a holy ghost knowledge that you truly have forgive us of our sins Lord today we pray that you'd be with the young people that you'd bless them Lord the ones that are looking for a spouse the ones that's looking for a companion in life Lord may they may they find one that's pleasing to you first and then pleasing to them father we pray that you'd be with us now take care of us heal the sick the ones that are not with us Lord bless them take care of them Lord be with the missionaries on the foreign field give them fruit for their labor father we pray today Lord if anybody's sick among us you said you sent your word and healed them and deliver them from their destruction so father we pray that as the word Goes Forth that we'll be healed and that we'll be Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost Lord just give us a refilling this morning we ask these things in Jesus name amen amen all right let's go to Ephesians 5 and that's what we've been reading on so we're still on choosing a spouse we went through two of the three things we went through the planning stage and the looking stage now today we're going to go into the praying stage and then I'm going to give you some things to do not do as you're choosing your spouse all right and if you're not if you've already chosen your spouse maybe it'll help you teach somebody that hadn't chose their spouse you know to be able to uh as parents be able to sit down and be able to talk to the kids and and may it be a Bible talk may it be something that you can go back into the word of God and tell the people tell your sons and daughters that hey this is the way if you'll do this this is the way God said we're going to have troubles and trials and tribulations but if you'll do this it'll surely make your life a lot easier all right so verse 28 of Ephesians 5 so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself amen for no man ever hated his own flesh but isth it and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bone for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh you may be seated and the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word we pray truly today now I'm going to give you a little bit of a warning for this afternoon when we get into the this is the choosing or the courtship part but when we get into the dating part this afternoon uh there's going to be some things said that you may you know you may need to have to explain it to the 10 and 11 year olds but I'm going to have to say things to help you not to go down a certain Road there certain things that we need to talk about so I I hope we're all adults and like brother R said I hope we're all godm minded all right and we know that we still live in this body and there's lust of the flesh things that we have to keep under control all right Paul you know Paul said I keep under my body under control all right for the glory of the Lord but he was a born again Christian right that's the problem we get people that maybe are not born again they can't control this man cuz there's no man to take to take over to keep control that's why you shouldn't marry an unbeliever all right so now let's look at the kind of a background of what we were talking about we were talking about the three stages of choosing a spouse now this is pretty much the courtship part you say the courtship part dating is when you find somebody I you've honed it down to one person right all right this praying and looking and planning stage is the stage where you're looking and you're you're plan you're making the plan and you're looking for that person and you're praying about it that's the courtship part we think the courtship part is the dating no the courtship part is trying to find one yeah what's a court out here courtship you're looking around trying to find you a spouse you're looking remember we talked about planning I hope you didn't uh felt a little resistance from some people that sometimes were too carnal but I triy to bring you some scriptures where Paul and would saying look I I I got a Mark that I'm looking toward I've got a place I'm going right he had a plan yeah he didn't just say God don't want us to look God wants us to be led by the the Holy Ghost but he don't want us to sit down in our seat at home today and say God I know I got the Holy Ghost you said you'd be my teacher now I'm going to close my eyes and you just teach me and I'm just going to sit right here and you're going to bring me my food and you're going to bring me my cash and you're going to bring me this that's not it exactly we are living breathing human beings amen we have a brain we were made in the image of God even in a fallen condition we were made to be little creators look at all this this come from trees this once was a tree right 90% of this building was once a tree right and then this here was chemicals that come out of the ground right right car and all the things like that what you have on today come from a plant no if it's cotton there polyester then man put two or three things together and made polyester but cotton come from what the Earth all right now God give man cotton but then he give man the ability to take that cotton and make it into clothes right amen so what am I what am I saying uh you can say what you want to about planning if you don't plan like I said last Sunday if you fail to plan your plan will always fail in anything you do in life right anything you do in life I I see that that Paul had a plan he had a goal oh he had a mark he said and I press toward that Mark well he found the Mark didn't he amen well God didn't just pick him up and St him in the mark he said I run that I may run to the end right not run to fail all right plan remember we talking about this background for last week set a goal know what you want write it down young man write down on a piece of paper what you want your spouse to be right now look it doesn't start with whether they're skinny or fat amen Little Tim said I want a skinny one well I me you I said desire that's okay but look for character amen look for character right amen we might have all started out skinny at one time but things happen amen gravity takes over and pushes whatever here down there so at once you know like sister Gail said she had this lifeguard that she married right well it looks more like a beach ball now my but he's your that's right but listen we must look me too I mean he's not much bigger than I am but look what's the first thing we do we start going with looks and is she this and is he that that's not what we're talking about right character is what we're talking about right somebody that has Christian values and character amen how many of us now you know you can hold your hand if you want to but how many of us married somebody that wasn't in the message I did right Terence did we got a lot of people did right well you know that's okay but like I was telling you that was a long time ago 30 years ago for me 32 coming up folks we're closer to the end now than ever yes at least we're 32 years closer than when I was so you better if you're coming up of age you young men you got to not make as many mistakes as we do and I think God has give us people to teach you that right that you don't make those mistake those mistakes that we made all right right exactly so that's why this afternoon we're going to talk about the dating stage but right now we're still in the choosing a spouse we're choosing we're looking we're we're planning we're writing down what we want we want our spouse to stay at home or is it okay for her to work are we going to have children in the first year are we going to have children in the fourth year we going to have this write those things down write it down and look at it right study it take the Bible take the prophet's message we give you all the quotes you'll have all these all these um messages have got all this attached to so if you ever want to go back to it make your little book of it I don't care what you do with it brother Joe's going to make a um an MP3 just of that so that if you want to listen back to it you can and refer back to it right uh be good for the young people to do it again but look we were talking about setting a goal but now the goals you set has it reveals your choice reveals your goal so what you choose right should reveal what your plan or your goal was right right okay and we're going to talk about some of those things not to to look for today now let's go to Philippians 3:13-14 that's what we talking about Paul was planning Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but there's one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark right he had a goal he had a plan he had something to do Paul did I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God God in Christ amen so his goal was to what put Christians in the in heaven or whatever you want to say put put Christianity to where that you can have what he has all right same thing with choosing of a spouse you don't want to choose a spouse that's wrong right when you're looking the word look means to turn one eyes toward something when you say look what do you do you're looking you turn your head but remember when you turn your head now you need to turn it toward a real believer not somebody that's sat in the message to you for 15 20 years 5 years 2 years character loyalty love and where they come from that's what we talked about before amen was very important all right know what you're looking for know what you're looking at right look is to turn one eyes toward something now let's start with the praying part praying means to make an Earnest petition and it's not God I want this woman can you give her to me no don't start your prayer that way right God I'm looking for a Godly woman don't put a name on it I'm looking for this kind of person Amen in my goals and my plan I'm looking for this kind of person and after you planned and look for that one person and found her now you have to pray so you're heading toward the dating processor all right you're heading toward it there's some things I want to show you when we get into the dating that brother brand says do not do when you take the dating sequence is the very very serious part all right this courtship part is not so very serious because you're looking you know you we always call it testing the water yeah but remember there's sharks in that water yeah so be careful of the Sharks and the water so we'll talk about that in just a few seconds we we'll do that and actually the next one coming up but after you've planned and looked for that one person and found him or her now you have to pray not just a short prayer thank you Lord you gave her to me yeah thank you Lord no you pray pray through on the matter the prophet said trust the Lord but be willing to accept and no or not now because remember what I always say God's knows are the best yeses you can have amen God tells you know that's the best yes you'll ever get cuz if he tells you know he knows what's going to happen in your in your future you don't if he says no he knows if he says yes he's not like us as as Earthly parents we might say yes and then wish we' have said no about two weeks later or a month later or two months later but God is a perfect parent if he says no he knows if he says yes brother Eddie somewhere down the line you're going to mess up but if he says no he's keeping you from that all right everybody understand that God's knows are the best yeses you'll ever have all right let's go to First quote and listen what brother Brown said about this marriage is Honorable but it should be entered prayerfully and reverently and genuine love for that woman will bind you together forever what you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven amen when you walk down the street Yonder she may get old and gray and wrinkled but that same love you had for her when she was a young beautiful girl you'll still have it amen you may get stoop shouldered baldheaded wrinkle fa and everything else but she'll love you just like like you did when you stand with wide shoulders and curly hair if it's really God right for you're looking at the time when you've cross the river Yonder when you'll spring back again to young men and women to live together forever amen I think we forget that part right I I I told I tell many people when I go out and Minister I say you older people you're closer to being young than we are right right you're closer to being young I know you get up and you ache and you pain and you hurt and all these things are going on but remember that's the part of you that's groaning to get back to that young person that's inside of you right same way with you and I we should be we should not set our LIF time gold that well we're just going to grow old together and that's it no we grow old together so that we can be in heaven together amen so that we can be in eternity together all right and is if you pick the right one let's go God's Eternal promise what what's his eternal promise that you'll spring back again to young men and women to live together forever that's God's Eternal promise he said he would do it he not only that would get to an Ament he swore he would do it amen so God swore that if you whatever you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven remember he said that when we are joined together that it's done it's finished right remember the Lord said whatever you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven let's go to number two H certain sound a man nowadays getting married you young fellas you better pray a long time ask God to give you a companion you young women the same way cuz it's so uncertain number three why it's alarming no wonder the home life is gone see any home life that's not stable what I said told you about marriage about divorces and all this stuff you just don't it's not stable I don't care how good you think it is oh yeah right I don't care how good you think it is well me and my ex-wife we get along just fine no you don't if you did you'd still be married to her yeah and vice Vera I mean her problem I mean ain't just her problem to you you got a problem to her too there always two sides of this thing any woman that's going to marry a man any woman is going to marry a man and she's not certain of that man she better leave him alone right and any man that's going to marry a woman that's why we go through these stages we go through the courtship and the dating process you better leave her alone you better pray through on it until God gives you the answer right and then what God joins together let no man put us under but we first we must pray through on that yes I think we'll have one more choosing of a bride you need to read that book I think today what's got so many divorce cases now that we leave the world in America in divorce cases yeah we lead the rest of the world I mean we got drive-thru divorces now yeah 299 you go up to the window and tell them you want a divorce and you get a divorce but we made it so easy why because it's just so easy hey me and my spouse don't get along with let get a divorce yeah there's more divorces here than anywhere else this nation and supposed to be and thought of a Christian Nation what a reproach our horp I think the reason of it is because that men got away from God and women got away from God and we find that if a man prayed now look how many times he said pray you ought to look this up how many times brother R talks about a man praying and a woman praying for a spouse if a man prayed and a woman prayed over the matter not just look at a pretty set of eyes or how big strong shoulders or such as that or some other worldly affection but would look first to God and say God is this your plan amen oh so God's got a plan right I read you that last Sunday Christ mystery God reveal brother said God had a plan and a purpose so God's got a plan right amen and if we would study we study about everything else but sometimes it's hard for us to study about getting married yeah and if we would study what we're doing when we're going to get married when we choose our wife our husband if we'd study over it a man should pray earnestly for he could ruin his entire life Remember The Vow is until death do we part that's what I said if a Christian man marries a Christian woman it's till death do you part there's no separation there's I mean you can separate for a time but we brother Dale get into that you know about well you can actually cause cause your wife to commit adulterine right and you're held accountable for it all right right right Remember The Vow is until death do we part and he could ruin his Life by making the wrong choice but now look when we get to the end of this this afternoon there's a thing called Grace yeah and we'll cover that also all right cuz a lot of us needed it cuz we're not sitting here in with a perfect marriage condition right right well you can admit it or not you say Amen but I know your life so but if he knows what he making the wrong choice and is marrying a woman that isn't fit to be his wife and he does it anyway then it's his fault right yeah you can't blame nobody else right it's your fault but if a woman takes a husband and knows that he's not fit to be a husband to you then that's your own fault after you know what's right and wrong right so you shouldn't do it until you thoroughly pray through amen all right everybody understand thatly that's pretty that's pretty pretty blunt from a prophet praying all right let's go to the next one the object of praying is to find the will of the Lord not to find your your will right find the will of the Lord right then say yes Lord that's right see this will help get the fleshly motives and objectives out of the way cuz God's not dealing In the Flesh right when you pray he's not dealing In the Flesh amen you're you're praying spiritually to a spiritual God but he knows your fleshly condition so therefore he is he's a perfect father if we'll listen to him all right listen to number five Prophet Elisha now that's that's what we do sometimes look at this sometimes we go off on a tantrum somewhere and not think about God not pray over it ask the Lord whether we should do it or not and we find out that our supply of blessings is cut off you ever read that quote our supply of blessing is cut off then we wonder sometimes well wonder why I can't have no more blessings you don't watch you let down in your prayer life you say well I'm a Christian well that's the more sign you should pray more than ever amen read the Bible every day pray every day don't make any decisions too harshly or too quickly without first considering God about it remember what daddy always says you come up and you say brother Dale I'm going to buy this brand new car what do you think Lord bless you you already made your de you're not asking me my opinion you're telling me what you're going to do you're just asking for a stamp of approval right of what you're fixing to do buy something like that or anything you need to just you need to say hey if a situation comes up it's like brother Brown said one time he said people believe me while I'm in the pull pit yeah he said but out here in in Family Matters he said they don't listen to me right like that brother that I told you about that brother AR that that uh Lord Brother Brown the Lord through brother Brown told him said you should never handle your finances well why go see somebody if you're not going to do what he says right exactly he wasting time but I'm sure you know what brother Brown probably knew that I mean he discerned that that man was so stubborn and that's a lot of our problem we're so stubborn we don't we don't consider that if brother Dale is our pastor and he's the one that's supposed to be our leader and we go off and do something off the wall because we feel good about it or or we we get all upset about it and then you say well yeah he's my pastor but yeah we we'll handle this one no I don't know about that that's right ask him shall I do this father ask him is it your will for me to do this then see what the holy spirit will speak to you right he might not give you a vision but he will speak in some way to you could be another human being wow he might not give you a vision but he will speaking some way to you to let you know and look where I underline that if you'll be sincere asking right there's the part be sincere and ask him I need an answer to this question and be sincere all right number six questions an answer see brother talking about waiting on a vision God doesn't deal with in Visions with many people right so therefore I wouldn't advise you to do that see don't sit and wait for a vision if you can never had one okay you may still be sitting there for a while God may give you a vision that's okay but look at what he says God deals with us different read that so I would if I was in your place and didn't have visions from before the Lord I would just wait upon the Lord and say Lord now you show me what's the decision to make right and then way you feel led to do it then wait B see that Lord now you tell me and then way you feel to do it then wait just a little bit right then wait a little longer that's right and see which way which side you lean towards which way the spirit say now father in my heart you know it doesn't matter now that's where we should start that right amen it doesn't matter Lord but I want to know what you want me to do about it and then he says that's the way he does in meetings he'll wait and he'll get the feeling of the Lord and then he'll follow that way that's a way to do it cuz it's in prayer then you do the the best you can even the best we can we make mistakes we know that but if we'll follow this plan of prayer wait wait a little longer so we're praying waiting wait a little longer all right now let's go to here before we enter the dating phase let's look at some clear dos and don'ts now these are going to be wrote down on the paper here so you can see them you don't have to write them down cuz little they're a little lengthy but I brought in some scripture and I also brought in some quotes to back it up of some dos and don'ts and not heeding to These Warnings could lead to disaster in your life so this is very important these should be discussed before a serious relationship begins amen all right let's go number one do not date an unbeliever now brother bandam said he never told you to date an unbeliever he said do not date an unbeliever right all right second Corinthians says be you not unequally y together with unbelievers right for what Fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion has light with Darkness amen oh but she comes to church her actions will prove what she is right or he is all right let's look at number seven quote here be certain of God and then in this wedding instead of marrying among his own people he went over and Mar a siner he's talking about Ahab and Jezebel I tell him Brother Anderson I met a girl yesterday came to the car lot her name was Jezebel yeah I told she was from Puerto Rico I said you know what they did to Jezebel in the Bible don't you she said yeah I know everybody told me but my mother named me this I said well okay all right I think I change it but he married Jezebel and she was not a Believer and no believer should ever marry an unbeliever now look under no circumstance cuz we're going to see in just a few minutes or later on this evening that that here's the famous quote well I'll date them or I'll start seeing them so I'll get them to come to church or get them to become a Christian you watch what brother rown says about that he says the Hound of Hell's out for you if you do that no believer should ever marry an unbeliever under no circumstance should always marry Believers but Ahab had done this evil thing and no doubt but what Jezebel was a beautiful woman and he'd fall for what she looked like instead of what she was so many people make that same mistake to this day she brought idolatry in the nation on the people she actually look at that the people the priest their ministers everything fell victim to Jezebel cuz he married an unbeliever all right number eight just like today when a Christian boy marries a sinner girl or a sinner girl a Christian boy that starts something right then see don't you get married unless you're equally yolked together with Believers you know to keep trouble down now look read this next one when God made man men and women in the beginning he made their Spirits then there's someone for you just wait see all right now let's go to the next one number nine AIA was the son of Ahab and that's what he's talking about his father had made married out of Fellowship married a woman that was not a Believer and that's all that always makes a bad home for any kid to be raised in that when unbelief and Faith tries to mix together now I don't know if some of you have unbeliev and husbands and unbelieving wives but they somewhere you going to have to deal with this with your children because if you're iniquity cuz if your iniquity of knowing to do better not doing it or not praying about it passed down to your kids yeah uh brother Brown said that I think I got a quote this afternoon it shows that brother Brown says visited iniquity is from the parents to the children talks about being a a a flapper and then a course girl course girl flapper prostitute right on down so it keeps falling all right because of the because of the generations I'm sorry that's just what it is but remember we're no good no not one we're not throwing stones in anybody but there's somewhere you going to have to deal with this cuz any bad home or any kids raised in this home brother say is a bad home yeah when unbelief and Faith tries to mix together now if the father had been a real strong man in his faith the child might have had a better opportunity but he didn't he didn't have he knew that there was God he knew there was Jehovah then his mother's God and so forth he was all confused and after the death of his father this boy in this condition kind of mixed up one way or the other and if that ain't a picture of the lands today one in the family is this way and one another and one going this way and one going that way now you could be married and that happen oh yeah you better be careful don't be looking at people sitting here with s that are single no you better be looking at your own life right one going this way and one that way no wonder we are producing we are producing so much juvenile delinquency right and all other kinds of stuff under the name of Christianity right it's because there's no Unity there's no real call out and stand for God Amen that's your prophet argue with him all right so never never never start a dating relationship with somebody you know you can't have right amen so if you start dating an unbeliever you not supposed to have that person so don't don't get yourself mixed up in it don't let emotions begin to take hold God cannot and will not bless this situation because of that quote that I showed you look in first Corinthians this says be not deceived evil communication corrupts good maners now look in the in the U NIV version then I pull this out the NIV version this is what it says about that scripture bad company corrupts good morals yeah right you hang around Bad Company long enough it's going to destroy your morals been there been there thank you be not deceived evil Communications corrupt good manners that's why you don't hang around you not you don't hang around people that tell dirty jokes you don't hang around people that do all the talks about all these things of the world and and these movie stars and all that stuff why it's evil communication and it shouldn't be a part of anything you listen to you should walk away from that junk sh your very parents of evil we'll we'll get into that a little bit later on all right let's look at a quote on that and see so it is I watched many times the wolf after the deer now here it is right here yeah if he can catch a little deer out of it that's the one they work on there's a lesson if he can catch a deer that's why the that's why animals her together yeah there's power in numbers right amen but now what happens is there's one will get out over here and think he's doing a little better than the rest of them and he can outrun the cheetah or the leopard well watch this there's a lesson if he can catch a deer away from the herd what let an unbeliever go out with an I mean let a Believer go out with an unbeliever right same scenario that's what the devil wants to do so you young ladies he wants you to go out with a boy that's not a Christian you too young man he wants you to go out with some little pain in Jezebel that's not a Christian right that's where he wants to break you up that's where he wants to he wants to Sock his teeth into you and this little deer will get out to itself away from the herd that's the one the wolf works on and to you old man or woman when you separate yourself from believers yeah hello somebody people say I can stay at home hello that's right that ought to hit a bunch of y'all sitting here today CU they're not going to see you tonight this afternoon I can stay at home be just as good Christian as I can what the prophet say right here I want you to read this yeah say it again so you're fooling yourself if you think you can the Bible said not forsake our assemble together and that much more we see the time coming if you're a Christian you long to go where other Christians are amen and fellowship with other Christians right so you cannot stay away from church and live the same life that's right you read that can't do it you can smirk and smile all you want to you can't do it you cannot do it I I'm I'm Brother Richard Marlo is he here he see it BL his hard he's been sick this weekend but his son I got a burden on my heart for that boy amen he he just needs to get around some Believers yes so you cannot stay away from church and live the same life you can't do it because it's like I'm hungry but I'll never go to the table I just I'll never eat I just I ain't going to do it see you got to go and feed on the word of God and fellowship one with another we need one a mother another we do need a mother we need one another more now than we ever did amen when you get yourself singled out from the rest of them that's making yourself just a little different when you single yourself out from the rest of them making yourself a little different you don't want to associate with them because they believe this and don't want to associate with that you're going on Dangerous Ground right then keeping away from church that's the success of my meetings is because real godly people pray for me right I wanted to put that in there but pretty clear Bad Company corrupts good morals all right let's go to the next one number 11 but now when he comes down and make fellowship with Ahab and he get in trouble now Ahab and when you take the world is trying to find fellowship with you just remember there's a rabbit in the W wood pile somewhere right when you take that little cigarette smoking boy that wants to take you out at night time young lady you chis Pentecostal girls that little Drinker and his hair comb down slick enough to hold his mouth open you reckon he saw that somewhere I think he did let me tell you something now there's something in the making right he says I'll marry you dear and then I'll join your church right he's a lying to you right if you if you love if you loves you and loves the Lord should be a PE I guess he will do it then he don't have to take you that's right and you men you young boys with some of these little p up Jezebels the same way you shouldn't do that shame on the pastor that fails to say that in the church so we said it we are called out separated different people Sanctified to the Lord in Israel all right sure the Bible said the devil would do it that in the last days and that's exactly what he's doing what he's separating he's taking unbelievers and Believers and putting them together all right let's go to the last one number 12 any time evangelism God wants his people be separated from unbelief and unbelievers so many of you people make a mistake in this sometimes letting your children play out here a little Oswald or you can put whatever name you want to in I guess oswal was popular back them see I don't mean to be different now and start you and so forth and be some kind of fanatic I don't mean that but you let a you be sure your daughter goes out be sure who your daughter goes out with at night time right see maybe you raised her a goded little old girl around the church and the first thing you know she gets out with Oswald or some of them and he's an atheist unbeliever and her life will come up ruined and you don't know what he is right you see then he'll marry her and look for your kids or your grandkids then you see be careful God wants his people to be separated all right number two you cannot marry a divorced person with a living husband now that ought to be self-explanatory Brother D was going to cover this but I thought I'd br bring it out in here in the dos and don'ts so don't even don't even yoke yourself up with somebody that's been divorced so cuz you can't marry them amen and he saith unto them in Mark 10 whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another right committeth adultery against her and if a woman shall put away her husband and be buried to another she committeth adultery all right let's go to Matthew this is Jesus speaking it has said whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement but I said un you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication we're going to talk about that this afternoon not this morning but this afternoon causing her to commit adultery causeth her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced commit adultery amen all right so that's pretty cut and dry we know we got we have Grace but listen to this we wouldn't need Grace if we' quit marrying unbelievers right well I mean we know we always going to need Grace but I'm talking about for married and divorce cuz remember two Christians don't divorce right now brother Brown is there any Scripture permitting marriage after divorce this is very important it says important well that's the reason it wasn't pertaining to this cuz that's the question aners on the seal as far as I can see my brother or sister whoever it may be there isn't unless your companions dead because the Bible said we're bound to them as long as they live so as far as scripture he don't have scripture that's it you've done took an oath over that you see so I don't think there is but as far as myself I don't find any in other words there's no scripture to say that so there's no reason for you to be dating or even looking at somebody that's been divorced sorry you can't do that right okay it's just one of them definite definite knows right now if he takes you in deception or she takes you in deception there was a a pointing case brother forny was telling me and this this brother was dating this sister and she was like from New York and she had moved down to whatever South Carolina North Carolina I can't remember it wasn't in Brother Jules church but it was something he was dealing with and the brother was dating her she said there's nothing in my life everything's okay so they made the vow to get married got married and on the wedding night if you understand what I'm saying he found out she wasn't a Virg she confessed that night that she had been with several men and that she even had a child that night the man immediately got up left wherever they were drove back home and had somebody come and pick that girl up now see what you see what you get into right now he's got a legal right mhm right and a Godly right and a scriptural right to put that woman away and marry somebody else and God never never worry about him being he's not double married though he went through all that cuz it was under a vow and she had committed fornication but he did it immediately he didn't wait till 3 days later after the honeymoon you understand what I'm saying right at that moment immediately he gets up and goes home tells that woman go get your daddy come pick you up and the of course it was all done separated and the the woman left but see you really don't hold things back you need to talk exactly talk about these things she said well I was afraid you wouldn't date me he said well you've already messed yourself up anyway you were messed up before I found you right and now you put me in a bad situation even though he's clean to do what he wants to do he still got that stuck in his brain right okay so and you can't even man someone that's been engaged right remember the sacredness of The Vow let's go to number 14 brother Brandon what is the meaning of an nor daddy read this one but let's read it again are people free to marry or is it just another word for divorce I'd like some information on this sure they're married long as they take that vow they're married just like a boy if a boy promises a girl to marry her under good faith so you should be going through the planning looking praying dating before any of this is discussed as far as hey let's get married yeah okay and the asking part should be right at the very end right amen she's just as good as married her the only thing the law does it gives you a bill and rights to live together to keep from being common law husband and wife but when a man tells a woman I'll marry you honey I'll take you for my wife will you take he's married your vow is sacred that's what marries you anyhow amen there's not no preacher can marry you Mistry nothing else it's your own vow to God and to this man when you promise you're married and a little lady if you promise to marry that boy you're obligated to do it if you marry another after that obligation you will from now on anyhow you'll be living in adultery right and notice now see she's she's pure as a lily as far as her virginity far as her natural virginity right she's just committed to say I'll marry you and then breaks it off brother BR said that's is just the same name has commit an adultery right amen from now on you'll be living in adultery she goes and marri somebody else she'll be living in adultery right it's very serious young kids it's very serious I I wish we'd all had somebody sit down and explain this to us before we started doing what we did and notice the same thing to a boy promising to marry a woman don't you make your vow to anyone unless you mean to stick with it remember there's the Bible for it Joseph promised to marry Mary you have to keep your vows when you promise a woman that she's a sacred little vessel and that's to bring child life into the world again so when you promise her you must marry her amen so you can't marry somebody that's been engaged right everybody got that amen okay number four here's the one I can change him or her after we're married this is Satan's life dating or marriage is not a witnessing opportunity right amen it's not a witness tool do not play with this idea IDE right you will get burned right pray for people witness to them invite them to church but do not use yourself as bait amen right oh if I could just get him to go to church with him yeah I'm just telling you what the prophet said let let's go through number 15 vasion of the United States let's read the the quote part just save time you take a man that's a good moral man and let him marry a little woman that ain't worth a dime it isn't long till he ain't worth a dime either right that's what happened to Ahab take the same vice versa let a nice little woman marry an old man that ain't worth a dime first thing you know she's doing the same thing he is how could I go this morning and point my hands on little broken up homes and things like that where lovely little mothers come into a drinking dad and things like that and thought they could do something with them right and now the whole mother and all of them is drinking and going on it's environment right all right next one now but when he come down and made fellowship with Ahab then he got in trouble now Ahab and when you take the world is trying to find fellowship with you just remember there's a rabbit in the wood pile I read this one before but I'm going to read it again cuz there's another emphasis to this when you take a little cigarette smoking boy you want to take you out at night time young lady you Pentecostal girl that little Drinker his hair combed down slicking up the hold his mouth open let me tell you something now there's something in a making see there's something in a making I'll make you dear then I'll join your church he's lying to you folks if you loves you and loves the Lord he'll do it then yeah he don't have that's why I said don't use yourself as bait you're not bait brothers are sister invite them to church invite them witness to them but don't yoke yourself up with them everybody got that amen you sure okay now please don't do that number five you don't really like this one watch out for spoiled or selfish people I'm going to read you what the prophet said about it okay if you don't mind then we're going to get to the last one and this one is very serious I see too much of this flirting going on all right this one though is is watch out for spoiled or selfish people sometimes I wonder if we intellectual Americans has enough discernment to discern right from wrong yeah especially Juvenile Courts prove that we haven't got it to discern right and wrong for our children they seem to have a good psych psychologist answer for instance like this if jior comes up to popping Stomps his little feet and screams out and shakes his head and says Dad I don't care what you say I want a hot ride that's typical America and the father says all right Junior I'll buy it for you you could say to that Dad why did you do it oh I love him yeah you remember dad junior is going to grow up to be a man someday and he'll marry and have a family listen to what the Propet said God help that wife that lives with a boy that's been brought up like that to have his way about everything he wants right can't discern right from wrong y'all didn't know the prophet talked about all this did you can't discern right from wrong that's not love that's pure ignorance right amen it's Prophet saying this not me okay the Bible's right spare the rod and you spoil your son all right is that all of that one yeah I think that's all of that one no yeah you spoil your son same way with the girls flip-flopping same way with the girls all right same way with the girls we don't want no we don't want no people that are spoiled yeah if you'll pray you'll get all these things away from you but I listen to the last one this is the last one on the on the page here flirting brother Brown talks a lot about flirting the Bible talks about flirting yeah people flirting is wrong flirting is wrong amen you know what you're doing flirting means you're coming as close and you as you can to something without crossing the line right that's dangerous right cuz the closer you get to that's what I telling y'all if we know something's wrong and we try to live right on the edge of that yeah you know the man walked up to the devil one time and he was sitting on the fence God was on the other side he walks up the man walks up and start talking to the devil and and he tells the devil said or God was over here with with a man well the man walks over close to the devil and says hey why you sitting on the fence he'd been wishy-washy in a lot of things you know you talking about sitting on the fence cuz you don't know which way to go or the other Satan just looks at him and say well I own the fence I own the fence so stay away from the fence right stay away from the line you see where the line is don't get right up close to it that's right if you are flirting with the world you don't intend on crossing the line but you're trying to get as close as you can yeah and wanting to experience as much of it as you can without getting caught by it right flirting hurts both parties involved by giving fault hope think of a young man that you got a flirty little girl and and she flirts with this boy and she don't care no more about him and nothing but she wants to get something out of it that's what you do you get something it's your own emotion when you flirt you're getting something out of it yourself right right it's selfish go back to that selfish person you get false hope all right listen what brother R says where's our strength gone say Samson now here's here's Samson watch what he do Samson did real well he got a good start and he did all right until he began to flirt right and when he began to flirt he got in trouble that was his first step of backsliding y h I believe tonight the first step of backsliding to the church when it begins to flirt with what unbelievers yeah right all right listen we're not supposed to be stuffed shirts we're not supposed to be think we're different but we are different right we are different live in this world different we are different we're supposed to present something that that no one else can live right but you don't have to go out there and think you're up here and there down here right cuz at one time remember you were down here all right first step was backsliding you see that that fisting woman there was one problem with her she was an unbeliever Delila was flirting also yeah we'll read in just a minute she was flirting also and what happened was she really didn't want Samson as a husband she didn't want him right she wanted to know where his strength was she didn't care about the man Samson she wanted to know how is he killing so many of my people cuz she was Philistine remember and he go kill all the Philistines she wanted to know how she was what she was trying to find a way to help her Philistines and herself and not help Sam all right yeah so you remember that Isaiah 3 and 6 moreover the Lord said because the daughters of thine are hoty what is the daughters of Vine right am man Bri the bright right are Hy and walk with stretch forth necks you know why you walk with stretch forth neck cuz you got on about 3 in heel right some of you do it too so you need to stop yeah right cuz out you're doing you're doing this and it's pushing this out and this back right right they're not comfortable please it's not walking on nail no don't tell me it's comfortable it can't be and wanting eyes we'll get into that this afternoon what that word w mean walking and mincing as they go you can't walk in a pair of high shoes without mincing right twisting right making a tinkling with their feet amen wow all right let's go to Proverbs 6 for the Commandment is a lamp and the law is light and the reproofs of instruction or the way of life that's what we're trying to do today to keep thee from the evil woman from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman right lust not after her beauty in thine heart neither let her take thee with their eyelids what do you do when you flirt yeah yeah ain't that true yeah quote number 19 please and it was getting night and remember her husband would return now this is talking about remember in the Bible where where where Jesus tells the parable about the woman with the tablets yeah the the headdress with the tablets hanging on it all right very very pretty um analogy all right and he found her one of those coins out it showed she had been marked to harlot and if she had to if she had defied or defiled herself in any way and it was seen by the people they brought her before the priest and brought witness that she had found she had been found such and the priest saying that she was a married woman took the coin there was coins hanging on the head right here right coins H and one was for a different item right amen they would take that coin look right here because look there's one there's there's a couple there there's not just one there's several coins hanging on a on a string off of her headdress the priest saying she was a married woman took the coin out of her tablet that she had been doing wrong by and if she had marred her virtue they took that out in other words she would committed adultery they pull that one out so everybody could see and her husband could see when he come home but now look here if she had been flirting showing that she wasn't to to her husband they took that one out so there was one for flirting yeah they took that one out huh and whatever it was they took it out and when her husband returned he found that she had been marked and he would divorce her immediately and have nothing to do with such a woman he didn't want he did not want such a woman yeah Lord get La toward dark in other words she found you know her situation was different from this he just making an example the church better be examining themselves by the word of God our Purity our loyalty our devotion we become tlers tail bearers cigarette smokers backbiters painted up Jazz Bells everything in the calendar that the rest of the world does the Christian church is associating in those things today CU you can't hardly tell the one from the other it's time we took inventory it's getting late amen all right so flirting flirting is a lack of commitment or to trifle have you ever looked up the word Tri trifle means to make Trivial or insignificant in other words it doesn't matter trivial or insignificant flirting is selfish and not genuine a put on and a fake yeah so there's nothing good you see anything good about flirting nothing good about flirting all right quote number 20 but Delilah did you notice she know that Samson had a power and she didn't know where that power laid she couldn't tell what that power was but there was some great power that Samson possessed and she wanted to find it she didn't want to get close to Samson cuz she loved and as theila she kept wooing Samson after her beauty wooing means to flirt yeah oh she dressed herself real sexy and she walked before him and she teed like some of the little teenagers of the day and so forth and when you act like something another strip te trying to wo woo Samson to her number 21 Samson a to have made his first stop when deila flirted her eyes at him he ought to have turned his head and walked on right Samson stopped and got in trouble Eve stopped and got in trouble right there Eve stopped just for a moment she got in trouble Sams stopped for a moment got in trouble amen and when the world presents something to the church or an individual don't stop keep moving amen right that's what the church needs tonight don't stop for his intellectual classical Pride keep moving on in the Holy Spirit right all right next 23 or 22 now if a man goes out here and is married to a man she goes out and makes love with another man and has has an affairs with him and comes back to her husband he should kick her out is that right she must be true to him cuz she is vowed to him and the bride of Christ is vowed to Christ and he is the word not even wink at the other side amen a woman should not even wink at another man right amen she shouldn't make no signs no emotion at all toward him right for she is absolutely a bride to one brid Grom amen we don't want none of your mixed trees your denomination be true to Christ the word he'll vindicate it true no sir not even any emotion of anything toward making love to him not join his ranks or anything else right or let him get you in his arms or in his care right or talk or talk to you over this way that way you listen only to One Voice amen my sheep know my voice a stranger they not what is his voice any man's voice is his word and this is it the Bible not one word added to it or taken from it you stay with that voice all right next one number 23 that's the reason many times today that a sinner is still want wondering about a beautiful young girl will cut off the locks of her hair to be popular paint up her face to make her look pretty put on clothes to show the form of her being right watch that now watch that here in this church yeah you put on Godly clothes looking but if it cleansed everything you got right what's brother Brown trying to say what am I trying to say if if it's if it's too close to the line it's wrong right you're safe it's too close to the line it's wrong that's all you got to say but don't close your form of being cuz it's the only thing that she can find finding somewhere to try to find something to come back to her when she can cause men to whistle at her wave at her flirt with her young men will do the same thing to a woman try to make your attractive to her neighbors will build a house and fix a certain way cuz it look a little better than the neighbor's placees all the time we are seeking for something and something keeps going just a little above it all right number 24 now it's not wrong listen it's not wrong to dress up and be nice right you need to dress up if you go on a date you need to dress up like brother Bown said you don't need to stop your car in the driveway and blow the horn he said you go get that girl if you're going to date her you go get her all right right amen you you cannot have an eternal Foundation upon popularity right that's the great sin of America is trying to be popular women trying to dress popular men trying to act popular all these little things going on the way it's taking place I don't have to start on that the first night but I didn't say the third night of the second we'll Coast on that tonight but being popular popularity usually leads to sin and disgrace certainly it does three or four marriages and all kinds of stuff and it has no Eternal Foundation right FL flirting flirting is wrong amen Proverbs we stopped at the eyelids but listen we're going to go on down to the to the end of it remember what we talking about getting close but not but not getting over the line but getting close but watch this all right listen for the Commandment is a lamp and the law is light and reproofs of instruction are the way of life to keep thee from the evil woman from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman lust not after her Beauty in thine heart neither let her take thee with her eyelids now we stopped there but listen to 26 2728 for by means of a horse woman a man is brought to a piece of bread yeah and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life yeah can a man take fire in his bosom what get close to the fire right and his clothes not be burned can't do it can one go upon hot Cal and his feet not be burned right in other words if you know that's hot and if you know that's a fire and you don't want to get burned don't go over there close to it right cuz you'll catch yourself on fire let's go to the last one Romans 13 listen to this we this is where we'll end up and this is where we'll probably begin this afternoon we'll get out a little early today

the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light listen to verse 13 we're going to break this down this afternoon let us walk honestly as in the day not rioting that word rioting does not mean going out and causing a riot right I'll read you what strong says about that word and drunkenness not in chambering that doesn't mean just going and sit in somebody's house right that's a whole different word and wanness that's another word we're going to cover this afternoon I'm telling you we're going to say some strong things this afternoon you may have to explain to your young kids but we're going to try to keep it clean as we can but we got to cover this old flesh guy that's right not in strife and envying but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof right in other words you put on Christ he'll take care of the flesh put on Christ he'll take care of the flesh part amen what we were talking about we were talking about working from the inside out but we still I I want you to still remember that that what brother BR said about the the wolf if he never get one deer off by itself right he can work on that one deer they stay in a group they're they're okay okay you get one off what does Satan prays on individuals and weaknesses that's right right individuals and weaknesses you see a weakness in a herd if if some if a deer or you see in those natural geographic you watch them the lines will be laying in the grass and they're watching if they see one limping or if they see one that's kind of straggling behind the herd moving off buddy they pinpoint on that one and they put a radar on that dude and that's the one that after cuz that's the weak one all right or one that kind of runs off over here and does his own thing amen that's the one they're going to kill and it ain't pretty when they finish with you it usually causes death 99.99% of the time we're going to look up those words this afternoon let's stand you love the Lord flirting is a lack of commitment so don't flirt kid right no flirting flirting is harmful amen if you're going to be serious about a girl sure show your affection to her but if you're not going to be serious about a boy or a girl don't flirt with them right right don't flirt with this World Church you'll get burned right how can you get close to the fire and not get your clothes what this is your clothes right yeah this is what he says cloth this is what clothes us is this right here it will get burn what we got brother let's sing
