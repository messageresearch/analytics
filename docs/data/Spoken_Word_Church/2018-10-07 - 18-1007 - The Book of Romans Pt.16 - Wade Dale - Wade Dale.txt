gonna fly out well you won't do a worker bee like that get come stay in it so the boy [Applause] and the boy these are really big like a big on they're really fuzzy you can tell okay you can tell who they are yeah they're baking fuzz you don't worry about no no new girl you make a man down there girl see the boys are so calm night the girl Bambaataa little girl basil obviously they will not end but remember if something stings you and you do not see the stinger it's not a honey bee honey bees always leave this finger in your body right and if you watch when they fly off they leave this there don't became their website that leave their venom site and that's why I'm still doing this yeah so don't ever do this or do this because you pumping it right into your body take a credit card or a knife or you can take a hair pin out and scrape it up oh yeah they're done that's not be life why be wasteful the very end to sting you because they know they're gonna know they know it's the last thing is gonna be because when they from it it has a barbed hook so when he goes into your flesh the barbs stays into your skin and then the bee flies off where you can see the string of stuff and this it's death and the venom sac and that venom site like you said I've seen it I'm on my hand you hold it like that and even watch it going for a minute it will keep pumping that venom in your body but they don't even bother me anymore I leaned swallow yes that's pretty much kamikaze they're not returning back yeah they are no good anymore one got killed Manuel can I ask you one more question God kill an animal you know what there's good enough for him good enough for me he killed them so and I don't mind eat them we met only mentally we won't eat them over there that's fine but now I'm still in this oh boy and I like the baby right so I mean dark death and I won't tell Emily I'll ask them honestly all that stuff to me is a non-issue I mean in a fatal do they fail to knows and really the games the not didn't careful with myself in time so I think he cares if you got because there is a person there but with an animal less than an animal is just no more that's just a it's not a person so it's something put on this earth for us to use it's the creation of God amen but I could go back he killed the goat I mean he killed the lamb pulled skins off that wasn't too good but that's just the way it is just wind it on this side that's just Lydia you know what this is just a space of time about that big do an eternity move we don't have to wait so I don't worry about here but it mode if you bring too much you make them other stuff for them women just go back it scrolled down to here but you know how you know that you can do this you know all that right you can how I just watching and learning what you're doing okay all right but you'll match that if you'll know if you'll match that you know they won't do it here because you match though it'll highlight that scripture and then you go over to that little plane over there you do all kind of stuff with it you send it out for scripture of the name on your Twitter or Facebook or you can send it as an email you can highlight it yellow if you wish so what that does is that marker that tells me where we stopped and I cut it off Flamengo Hawaii old problem but it was pink yeah the last I know that's where we stopped at and that's where we start our reading so so bookmarks like all right let's say we were talking about hope last time we were talking about adoption to wit the redemption of our body verse 26 likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmity for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the Spirit itself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered advanced then what that mean how many times him do you felt like brand for somebody didn't have one clue that they were going through the trouble that they were sick or that they've just been a wreck but the spirit did so i sent a message to you they said you need to pray for this person i'm telling you all people i said last night this whole thing is connected to God in human flesh on this earth all judgment is given to man I read in the Bible judgment is not from God himself it will be at the judgment seat it will be judged by with all the people around because remember that's the great thing about this message I'm telling you I know if I'm born again I do not have to stand in that judgment in front of the judgment seat but that I am now transferred to the good not the cute because remember brother Brown said he took your place he stood accused paint the price so that you don't have to ever have to pay it again so if you're born again you've never have to pay that price doesn't matter what happens to you do not have to pay that price brother Brown said you're already judged so if you were already judged I'm just will take what he said but then once that transfer to you've been that transfer have you been the judge because you're the word may flashing the word judge is everything not the word the Bible God's not gonna stand up in today a judgment flip through the 66 books of the Bible and condemn people with it what's he gonna do turn around and say didn't you you you whoever didn't you ride didn't you witness for this guy yes and he turned me down yes who's the judges really I mean that person just herself but it was through you there has to be a righteous in other words there's listen you gotta have a righteous to judge the under object that's right there's no you can't have it will everybody's right well everybody's unrighteous we'll see that's the denominational world is is everybody's unrighteous except for Christ and yeah everybody's gonna have to stand in judgment seat and give an account no not that one the white throne judgment the bride does not stand in that judgment know we do have a judgment we know that because of what Paul said but we do not ever stand before the white throne judgment ever where the judge because I'm going to read you this afternoon we hang a lot on the stone land in Revelation is one this is that's not a man globe gird about the path in right form finish reading the whole thing his feet are like brass brass is always in the bible of judgment or judge brass so what is it it's the bride judge in the world to me that's really just very simple and you know what that don't make us if you think you're gonna walk around this world and go uh-huh so world's gonna be judged by Mabel see there as your there's your attitude which which is wrong so if you don't change it you might be the ones that stand in the funny side up I'll go be Delta but Matt's mindset can't be like on that this Jesus going it gotta be a Newport cuz I'm saying it right now my mom you sit there I know but God if I'm right there if I had to judge be Korea for my daughter for some lot of people I know would I be steady with that and say you know I did testify too but thing is you did wrong to me true my mother said would go back at OPM we'll see that's power without character yes without character satanic you will use it wrong every time so I'm not good I'm not what I want to be okay let's see guys that run turns we encounter brotherly kindness okay but it's you know given you forget it doesn't matter if you kill you no matter who killed your kids you guys will be forgiven whether you do testify to them somebody will and they won't be a person standing at the Y own judgment that hasn't been told something because you can't judge them by that okay if you don't have something given to but I'm judging but - you gotta remember and we'll read this next Sunday because I picked it up last night or this morning if you've done to the least of my little ones you've done under Maine now there's your judgment that's right good all right we always like to go with the good but the man also so the people that done you wrong at the time don't judge me you know that's why the Bible says don't judge them they will be judged that's the hardest thing for us to do is to back off and say okay in other words don't have to say this out loud but you say okay look if you don't change you'll get Church yeah somewhere down the line you'll get yours just let it go that's what problem is though we don't let it go that's our problem that's right we let it fester them we make a case and like they simply make a case against them when it's all their fault okay but a brotherly kindness says we've got in I've been food we've all got to say it's my fault first okay it's my fault further help you gotta say it's my fault first that feed acts like he does yeah you got to know that and now don't open your mouth you got I saw her she was like really yeah the Bible even says no the Bible says one didn't jokes ain't going out with my job but what I'm saying though God slay me yeah yeah I'll trust him not to see that takes it way up here ain't down here that will be up there Dogon slay me get all trust right what what you have a problem with that person yeah does this yes absolutely it does because though God's Way me you gotta you gotta look at that guy and say though that guy slamming slay my family whatever I'll trust God but I can't Harbor that my heart I have to leave that judgment to God right but if I had to take you know but remember knowing that won't be the end of because joint God will judge that person by what he did to you it's all it's all connected yeah it comes from back yeah come into life throne judgment if he killed your whole family okay but did you forgive him but still you forget it he's not ask forgiveness from God if he never asked forgiveness he'll go to the life throne judgment and he'll be judged by what he did you okay alright so leave the judgments and that's why says guys no man that's kinda strange though the policies judge no man and then we're gonna be the judge of the world yeah but you judge no man in that way you're not to judge anybody in that way and that's why the Bible says go pick a brother to court you're not supposed to take a brother and the Lord the car collects man's deep the Bible says I didn't read it like Sonny but it says take the least in your congregation and let them judge you not to preacher and not the Deacons and not the owners it takes us take the least among you let them do the good well that's pretty that's pretty good honey if you got holy hope you feel listen to it he will be the judge okay can we get to our subject all right likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know that know not what we should pray for for as we all but the spirit of self makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered in other words we don't know why don't we pray for so-and-so or why we never had a personal my heart this morning the teeth positive brother clothing this church they could have been in hospital you can hardly wall think you may have gal but when they come on your heart you just press long it's pain no second I wonder what they're doing it's me please people spare the details okay when you come up to be prayed for don't give a 15 minute dissertation the spirit already knows what you up there for Wells don't have to and either searches the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit hmm because the maintenance intercession for the Saints according to the will of God so he already made an incision force now these things is not like see things like Catholic Church they sold well there says you the Saints are going to make intercession well nothing think talk about that you're aware the sainted ones they know there's no dead Saint right All Saints are alive right okay even the ones it's over in the states dimension they're like if I come back here before their time their Hank right granny always needs a bunch of Hank all right Leslie I'm not gonna expand off because what the Bible can't get off is good thing the Bible says the judgments starts where house of God if man would have took that because man and the olden days took the Bible and wrote laws you can see even though even the wolf jumped some of the junky logs we got in the United States was written from the Old Testament they have a defense cities well yeah we told you you're innocent till proven guilty so we get all that from the Bible but what happened is man's idea like I tell them last night that bug got any ear and I kind of like to echo that's a good analogy could you those bugs eat the tree down well they didn't literally eat a tree that's an analogy or uh or a parallel you can't eat the tree life drilling I've never been eat but the effects of that and what happened the old love died in the air with the bugging out of there the bug got in the air of the people and the preachers started preaching things that was not right and the people just took it and made the doctor go God never made these false coughing coughing no man may stop stop the doctor he - searches the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God and we know it's his whole point to that glass grief because we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose alright now let's analyze that for a minute before we get to this part for we know that all things work together for good to them that love God now can we interplay and we know that all things work together for good to them that are born again because a lot of people in this world said why God why did you do this to me or why do you got to do this with me and they're not born again well I tell you one clicking on top okay yes all things work together for good to them that are born again because if you already born again your soul is already eternal how much more do you want to them who are the called not just all the called according to his purpose we all have a purpose in all right but we are be called cause remember men your call you were chosen but now if you recall your him your God that's right because watch this right here for whom he did it for no we talked about this last night he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son his son as one son a man the eternal God in human flesh that he might be the firstborn among many brethren he was but we are because remember we are the church of the firstborn we get when he gets all right so I mean this this just cleared that this one scripture cleared up predestination good and I'm running the people in the message of justice this is predestination now brother Bradley said it's not God putting you in a tube and pulling you through that to you that's right right that's the way most people see predestination I was this seed me and usually someone think I did it I was this here so I'm gonna be this Peter that's true okay that's true if you were in the mind of God see the God the Word of God you always was and you're gonna come you're gonna know all right but that word rights in the walked on the earth this is first this is second this is third okay nobody got that foreknowledge go first he thought of us being bright or not Brian and then issued Ernie because brother Brown said predestination green estimation is pre destiny determined right that's that line of my thanks all right but those who lead for new he put you in this linen man and then what happened was though those who lead for knew he did predestinate one of the pretest I mean destiny determined beforehand words it determined before him we for man's destiny determine before brother Byron said what predestination looks back to for knowledge okay for knowledge looks to destiny this is your life that's right from beginning to end we didn't have bad that would in the mind of God the predestination looks back to for knowledge for knowledge looks to destiny those who he foreknew he did predestinate okay the Bell right with that any question pretty simple those before him he did predestinate all right so then he took take whatever you want to call it the seizure of I to say word word of God always was always will be not a Bible it's not a Bible it's what we have to use to get our point across but it's not a viable it's the word amen in the beginning was the word works with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and that's why last night we said we'll be judged by the word well what is a word the word is God in human flesh if it's just the word land on pages this day it's right this is data that does no good and really going into somebody in it right that does know that it there's meeting there we have some Bibles come in the post office Gideon Bible then with a stack of cases of Gideon Bible that high good idea good job put them in the motel but you know what if somebody don't pick that thing up it'll just burn with the rest of the world but it's the Word of God amen it's the letter that God wrote [Music] that person [Music] yes but now you gotta remember by foreknowledge I'm saying this is the eternal okay this is not this is somebody else this is the center okay he wanted him to work so he's not here that's why brother round made that analogy with the priest he drew the circles and he went like this he said that's no words that's the predestinated the woman at the well if you want to say well they're big but when he drilled the other bad drawing let's think people that took all my stuff but what happens is is what brother branham said God looks at the Pharisees and he's one blacked out why because of he knew what they would choose oh right you knew what they would choose predestination to me honestly people want the simplest doctrine ever to come out of them on the gun stand list in the world and it explains a lot because you take my brother Dale said last night you think these people said you said this Steve doctor you always want your firm I agree that if you say the word is the seed okay okay but I want to ask you a question we're going to read it this afternoon if somebody shows that see Matthew the son of man is the solar God in human flesh is the solar of the state that's exactly it so those he foreknew he did predestinate he saw your journey all the way from beginning to end therefore he could have the word ready for you yes you come right down this line and it's not God pulling you good cube actually sure choice that's right it's your choice to be right here you either can be here air is your choice but he foreknew before the world who wouldn't who wouldn't brother mountain cover that the would and who would not it's bad but he give him a chance yes Judas he knew you'd us a chance to be a part of this gave him every opportunity in the world to be a part of this and he what he rejected it right all right yeah so those he foreknew he did predestinate that's why I'm telling you the reason God wrote this word was because he saw what part we would need when we got here amen there's your seed to stay everybody wants to make it some little permanent or some little wiggle tail something the Bible up we read in the sacrament the parable of the sower the Solars the son of man the seed is the one word when I hear brother man talk about seed I do not my brain now does not go to a literal little dot when I hear him talk about the seed I go straight to the word of going straight to the word side and it's the Word made flesh not just words debate so that's the main predestination is just so something because remember without without the where's my poop are you sure Luis got interpreting today so he's gotta go but look without the will now brother Brown but remember even without brother ground this was always in the Bible right this is always in the scripture for whom he did foreknow we can read that that's very reading a plain English King's English actually thank you but now most people this is predestination no this other stuff not yet though to the cornea so what comes first for college those who he foreknew he did predestinate execute pre-determined your destination he predetermined your destination not by his design because all Symbian people in this world if God desired it would become the word and would go right down through here and then but you know what that would be so like a robot that's right that would be so inhuman that would be a robot you'd be like okay I'm gonna live in my seventy year and then I'm going to heaven you know no these still give those toys we got choices in here that's my grill that squiggly line we still make choices because we got this thing that's great yep that's what I've been saying T yes so it is your choice everybody's got a choice oh then guess what if we chose this part we go we know those a lot on just because we're covered in him but this for dollars in predestination judges these people over here even though listen it's like I said before think about when Jesus came out of the grave all power telling them has been given unto me why didn't he just have to devil get rid of all the demons kill only he can do that why don't you just kill it off and say okay alright Brian come out come out No you don't call your kids into the existence either do you you have to go to a birth process you have to go through a conception process right so that's the same way with God he runs in company he couldn't just all the sudden walk up and go well we're going to go away when I meet him how when you test them up we're just going to have all my people here all my kids devil go no you do that because when he said that we're going to get to that when he said all power in heaven Earth's been given unto me that's where we were we weren't in that man that was the Sun man and it's the son of man to come back in the end time we gotta say the same thing he says yes man all power never nervous been given unto me cuz when your body's changed you can say that you can say all Bernard enters me give another because there's no dimension can hold you there's no devil can hold you deaths been destroyed daddy you got no sorrow no pain no agony hey when you get a body change come on all power net winner has been given of you we're working toward it we're getting that for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of the son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate according to foreknowledge those who he did predestinate he called and you answer he called in us remove meaning of called for your chosen why the one chosen by the election like what a preacher said one time election that's what the voting god voted for you at the devil voted against you you swing the vote right either to the one this way or to the one this way you swing that's why it's called election you're the leg why because you chose God over the devil that's very simple thing moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified so if God justifies you that means you're going to continue on the glorification Amen you man so that's a really good promise thing what shall we then Paul let's let's give a summation of all this I just talked about it gotta be forced to be consistent you know call it darlin justified he didn't he will suggest the power and of the justified and he also glorified us we can't morph ourselves with fame then what can we say to this whole thing if God be for us who's gonna be against right he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things in other words through Christ this is that this is that summation of Romans Oh No where the worth is waiting for join ater 17 if children then heirs heirs of God going enterprise now Paul speaking that same thought of down here in this verse we're talking about those fewer heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ how shall he not with him with his son I'll feel free to give us all things give us all Fame all right who shall lay anything because what now listen there are natural judges on this earth that have done things wrong that will probably that will have to be judged for and we see now that they've done you know they do all kind of stuff but that's human my stuff we're talking about Donald Mac mm-hmm God Almighty who shall lay anything to the charge of God alone that's not what it says what does he just transferred it to you is he led so then we should not have a problem with it's gonna be the judge there's your answer who shall easy think us remember that's the glorious thing about this whole part now I want to make this complaint and and there's things we've done in our life that was wrong yes the man and we may have done with somebody else in our younger life and the things that we did we may have done with somebody else but do you know what if you've been forgiven of that is that person that forgot it but God had you'd already forgotten hey so who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect folks our charts card is empty we have zero it's May but now when that person walks up the white throne he may still have her she may have in their mind what's he doing up there what's she doing up there right but you got away back home what God say and then God said he played to see it forgive them that's never to come even remembered again now he said never be remembered that's what I said if we're standing out here back here judging they can't think we can't have or you gonna have to stand up thank ya who can lay any charge the god of the land you know millions that way another billion that way there's still zero there's no account charge P that's what we're going to say I believe I hope when we come to the change of the body but my problem with changing the body is is we make a list of things we do we talk too much we don't do this within this without praying I would not read the Bible we don't lettuce and something I call a laundry list when I want that this thing and look he don't make a lid it's already been in the Bible it's already been here forever so it's just something we're trying to believe okay he experienced own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who show away my sequence in nature who shall bring a charge against what God's elect it is done then justified so guess what declares righteous he has declared you righteous today right okay he has declared you righteous who shall lay anything to the charge of God's Lake it is God than justified who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died a rhythm that is risen again wouldn't a matter that God died Christ died it steady rose hey hey steady roads alright because many people died saying they were Christ then write a memo conflict said all that one took 400 our wolf out in the wilderness we heard another thing from a big city with cry all these are false prophets and false Christ Christ it died again rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us what the little things we did and he's not interceding for our soul hmm no he doesn't know that well actually that is the salt God's been in me that is part of you same thing it's the intercession for the little - as you were climbing up the stanchion perfectly well I think at that moment the person whoever that is is going to be standing there is really not gonna be to me that's just an analogy okay they're not gonna really be standing there looking through the crowd trying to find somebody they committed adultery or committed to the sir well he's total bank with me like no they're gonna they're gonna realize but that if somebody's standing up later and somebody's standing here and they have a lot roads and they're standing in there and young bodies and this person standing here and the body that he said then and and been in a place where really what nice for the lifestyles makers give them one thing he's not gonna be up there like Dave said he's not going to be the argumentative people that's going to come to the white throne brother religiously not to sin okay not the same don't really in just people that was that was my anniversary present the June that's all the we can say so yesterday was our 39th anniversary I tell him it's the same woman she said it's not all right let's go you know what people think they're thinking and I'm crying god you're talking about all of it or about it or or we didn't know that no no actually human right a new game
