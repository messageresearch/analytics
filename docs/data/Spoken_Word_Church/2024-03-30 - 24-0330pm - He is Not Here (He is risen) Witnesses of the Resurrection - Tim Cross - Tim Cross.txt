read the word let's go to the author once more and just ask him to come and minister in our midst this afternoon Heavenly Father Lord I I know that your children have come this this this afternoon Lord not to see me or hear from me Lord but to see you Lord and to hear from you and we know that only you can come and break the bread of life to our hearts and Lord uh to make us greater Witnesses Lord of your resurrection and we know Lord that you're alive today you've proven yourself to us Lord we know that you are revealed through your word and we pray father God that you will take every spirit in the in this service under your control Lord Every Soul that has come here today Lord if if somehow the enemy Lord has gained a grip in their lives may you break that grip Lord may they may may their faith rise Lord to believe your word Lord and for Satan to lose his hold and lose his power however it may be expressing itself Lord in sickness and discouragement Lord depression whatever it may be Lord we're claiming the victory for this service today Lord and we believe you have ordained these Services even before there was a world Lord and we're walking in that purpose Lord we're walking Lord in in the predestinated footsteps of the Sons and Daughters of God and we know where you're word is ministered and believed it brings Liberty Lord and freedom Lord it will draw us closer to you Lord and let you express yourself through our lives Lord we pray you'll grant that today and Lord as as brother Wade has had it on his heart Lord to have these meetings we know Lord that not just something he thought up Lord but it's your very desire expressing itself Lord and and we've come Lord to be a part of that and and just ask you Lord to have your way Lord have preeminence in our midst be glorified Lord be be manifested be exalted Lord in our midst Lord we want you to be high and lifted up oh God and and be the most memorable thing about these meetings Lord is what you do in our lives and in our midst and we'll give you the glory and the honor and the praise for we ask it Lord in your matchless name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen let's read in Luke chapter 24 uh verses 1- 11 and then we'll take one verse from acts chap 1 uh verse number 8 amen now on upon the first day of the week very early in the morning they came into the supper bringing the spices which they had prepared and certain others with him and they found the stone rolled away from the Seiler and they entered in and found not the body of the Lord Jesus and it came to pass as they were much perplexed thereabout behold two men stood by them in shining garments and as they were afraid and bowed their faces to the Earth they said unto them why seek ye the living among the dead he is not here but is risen remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee saying the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again and they remembered his words amen many times that's what a message does is remind you amen put you in remembrance again of what he's already said what he's already purposed and determined to do amen and and and and they remembered his words and returned from the Seiler and told all these things unto the 11 and to all the rest it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and mother and Mary the mother of J James and other women that were with him which told these things unto the apostles and their words seemed to them as Idol tals and they believe not what a place for his own chosen disciples to be and let's also read in Acts chapter 1 verse uh number eight we'll just take this one verse of scripture and you shall receive power amen after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and this is what captures us and unto the uttermost part of the earth amen may the Lord bless his word and the reading of his word is you're seated this afternoon amen I want to take for a title that phrase from the scriptures he is not here yeah he is risen amen and uh maybe we could just uh or subtitled this the witnesses of his resurrection amen I'm I'm reading here from a message preached in 1965 I have heard but now I see and he says could you think church that you are looking with your own eyes The Living Word of God made manifest the promise of the hour in the past days looking with your own eyes at the Living Word being interpreted in natural form God Among Us I see him with my own eyes the one I heard that he would do it all the old sages looked for this day now we see it manifested with our own eye how many old shouting Methodist Baptist and the real genuine Pentecostals in their age long to see this happened many of them know it would happen but we stand tonight seeing it happen oh don't you love him amen you know I I I just want to begin this afternoon by saying this if you're going to be a witness to the resurrected Christ it will require faithfulness when it seems he is absent amen amen while the disciples you know when we we we picked this scene up this this afternoon in Luke chap 24 and we see women coming to the Tomb of the Lord Jesus amen the disciples amen were disbanded they were scattered amen only a few remained faithful amen but uh uh you know these who came to the tomb that morning amen were there to perform a service to the Lord amen even with no hope that he would do anything more for them amen and I I believe what I'm seeing here is that Mary and these two that were with her amen were representing the believer in the end time amen I believe Mary was a type of the Bride I believe she was a type of the Overcomer and she had a faith or she had a quality of Faith amen that distinguished her even from Peter even from John even from James and all the other disciples amen she had something that would not let her leave oh my amen they came to the tomb and and and maybe I should um maybe I should also read uh there's a couple of accounts of this but let me uh let me just find out real quick and if you've heard me preach before you know this is how I am I I I never have it fully baked when I come out to preach it but let let me see I don't know if it's in Matthew's gospel um trying to see which one has the account I wanted to Yes um oh Jesus help me this afternoon it won't hurt us to read too much scripture will it Matthew 28:1 in the end of the Sabbath as it began to Dawn toward the first day of the week Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the supper and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the Stone from the door and set up upon it his countenance was like lightning and his rment white as snow and for fear of him the keepers did shake and became his dead men and the angel answered and said unto the women fear not ye for I know that you seek Jesus which was crucified he is not here for he has risen as he said come see the place where the Lord lay and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you in the Galilee there shall you see him lo I have told you amen now one of these accounts I I I I forget which one it is shows it may have been it is in John it is in John we'll get it later I got my message all turned around don't get nervous don't get nervous honey they've seen enough for me to know this is how I preach amen but we're looking at of faithfulness now because someone is going to get to experience amen before anybody else the news that Jesus Christ is not dead he's not in a tomb he's not cold he's not a victim of a conspiracy of the Romans and the Pharisees and the Sadducees amen but he has actually done everything that he said he would do before they did what they did so Mary and these other two come to the tomb and they they they they see there that the tomb is empty amen and and so they they they had a level of faithfulness and this is what I I want to capture this is what I want to make sure you see this evening amen they had a level of faithfulness that was determined to give honor to him that was determined to worship him that was determined to perform a service to him even if they didn't have any expectation that he could do anything for them they didn't think he was alive they didn't think he would ever perform another miracle they didn't think there was anything more that he as a as a as a natural person could ever do for them in a physical sense but they were determined to do something for him regardless and I want to tell you when you approach him with that level of zeal with that determination with that faithfulness you're going to get something that others do not get amen you're going to receive something and you are be going to become a witness you will have a testimony that exceeds others amen this faithfulness this dedication this steadfastness will be met with the reward amen amen real faithfulness isn't proven when it's known that he is present right but when it seems that he's absent or distant sir that's when real faithfulness is proven you can think about this in a marriage you can think about this even between parents and children that's right how do you know your your children are really absorbing and listening and and becoming subject subjective to your your your parenting when they behave in your absence when they don't know you're looking amen and they're still listening they're still behaving they're conducting themselves that shows amen there's a real relationship that shows there's a real faithfulness I wonder sometimes if God doesn't withdraw sometimes what we sense as his presence to prove our faithfulness man oh brother I wonder if that's not why Jesus didn't I'm sure it's why as a matter of fact when he reappeared on the emus Road amen he withheld their Vision or their understanding from knowing who he was amen he he he he veiled he veiled uh his he veiled his identity to their eyes and he took them to the word he took them to what Moses said he took them to what David said he took them to those Old Testament scriptures because he wanted to establish their faith and who he was as the word of God revealed rather than rely on what their five senses could declare to them because that'll fail your feelings will fail your senses will fail your emotions will fail the supernatural amen May Fail but his word will never fail and when your word when your faith is anchored in that there's nothing the devil can do to shake it sir amen so as a parent you know you may just pull them back a little bit and watch it are they going to still behave are they still I wonder if that's why God didn't allow his Prophet to leave the scene for the real bride to be proven for the real followers the real Believers the ones who were really caught by the message instead of enamored by the messenger because there were plenty of those and they dissipated when he left the scene and some of them are still waiting for his return then they're going to straighten up again but I want to tell you something if the word hasn't caught your attention and the word hasn't transformed your life if the message that the messenger spoke amen hasn't uh translated you and hasn't brought you into relationship with Jesus Christ I am very doubtful his return will do anything different but thank God there's a real bride there's a real people amen that aren't just looking for the prophet's return but they are preparing themselves for Christ's return amen he's going to bring his Prophet with him when he comes amen I believe that amen you know real real the the faithfulness of a marriage is proven when they're apart from each other that's when they can be real faithful real true the the the the saying goes I almost said the Bible but the Bible doesn't say that the saying goes absence makes the heart grow fonder absence can actually strengthen the bond make you long for one another even more make you appreciate you know you don't miss the water till the well runs dries the say goes but you know if you don't have a true Bond the absence will make you forget the feeling boy I'm way off my notes now but you know it's is all you had was an infatuation you like the way they looked or the like you just like the way you felt when you around the me but just get a little give a little distance give a little space and oh you get eyes for somebody else that's not real love that's not a that's not real faithfulness real faithfulness is proven amen when the two are apart and their love grows stronger the love grows stronger the bond grows greater amen oh my so Mary Joanna and and and and Mary it was Mary Magdalene Joanna and another uh sister named Mary showed this dedication and the devotion and they were the first living Witnesses of the resurrected Christ amen now Jesus Christ is none other than the revealed or manifested word of the hour and he's the same yesterday today and forever amen he's the same and yet his his word is continually unfolding or we could say advancing right amen God's word isn't changing but our understanding of his word is evolving because he has been unveiling himself to reveal himself to humanity or to his creation and it's a continual amen I believe the prophet of God says God God cannot decrease amen but he's always on the increase amen so is unfolding or unveiling the re revelation of himself to us and it's growing greater and greater and greater and greater amen so uh um um the these faithful followers amen went where he was or where he had been to the tomb and they had to hear an angel's message he is not here he's not where you left him he's not in the last place he was known to be this is where you left him but it's not where he is now and a real angel messenger amen will not point you to where Jesus was but he will point you to where he is his present day fulfillment his present day manifestation and it will validate what previous Messengers said it's not a departure from that but it's pointing you to the Fulfillment Hallelujah today of what they were saying even in their day he is not here but is risen and the angel put them in remembrance of his word didn't preach a new message to him repr preached what he had told him amen but the trauma and the grief and the tragedy brother Joe had made them forget what he said they forgot in Heat of the Moment and watching him amen surrender to the authorities and and surrender amen it was it as it would seem as divine power to place himself under the subjection of the Roman Empire am mean it it made them disillusioned friend think about where we are today some people are only disillusioned they have not lost the faith they are not in apostasy amen they have not blasting the Holy Spirit they have only become disillusioned because of the trauma of a pastor leaving the message a church splitting up the family being split apart all of these things can shake people but if they're Sons and Daughters of God the word of God will reach them and an angel will go to them and may involve you Amen to minister love and the truth amen you can be restored glory to God Peter was in this number amen there were there were 10 other disciples beside him amen who were also disillusion and disbanded but God raised up a mared to take the message to them and remind them of his words Hallelujah he was the same he was the same at his birth now I'm just going to hit a few places here and I hope I don't lose you along the way is this all right it was the same at his birth and I believe brother Solomon just mentioned it for a moment last night you know those maj were over I believe in the country of India and they saw they saw a development in the constellations they saw a shifting in those heavenly bodies and that shift or that alignment of those stars in those planets told them in the heavens something has happened on the Earthen it's not a future event it's not way up now right now God had condescended from the Realms of glory and had birthed himself in a little baby those Stars Lin up and they realize something has happened over there and they packed up they loaded up their camels they left the observatory amen they left there and they took their gifts and started on a on a on a journey of years and they were following the light of a star that's right Hallelujah they were following the message of a messenger that was reflecting a greater light but that would give them navigation Oh Glory from where they were to where he is and you won't find it without a star you won't find him without the messenger you won't meet Christ apart from the messenger or the agency that he employs on the earth to point you to where he is amen but they were traveling traveling TR and traveling and the light appears to be hanging over Jerusalem right now remember the the light was over in the west and they were coming from the East to find him and and and and he was all they wanted he was all they wanted they just wanted to to to find him Minister their gifts to Him worship Him He was the reason for it all he was the reason the Stars aligned and so then they they you know so so what I'm seeing in this brother Wade Jerusalem was somewhere along the way between where they were and where he was that's right but Jerusalem also happened to be the religious capital of the world of the Jewish faith that was looking for the coming of the Messiah the Fulfillment of the promises to Abraham so they get into the capital city you know surely it's here it's right there on the map lights hanging right over Jerusalem surely he's got to be there and that's where all the Scrolls that's where all the prophets it's that's where everybody that's looking for the Messiah that's their headquarters and they got in there and the star disappeared they got to the capital and there's a lot of there there's a Temple think about this friend there's the memories there's all the history of Israel all the great battles that been fought and one and God had come on the scene and King David and King Solomon and all these things all they had it all there that's right but when they got there they were still looking for him am where is he where is he born King of the Jews where is your king we know he's here we know he's on the earth his star has declared him the messenger did not come to declare he's coming he came to declare he is here where is he where is he and Herod heard this there's a King born on the Earth yeah there's another ruler there's another Power there's another Uprising there's another Dominion hey I want to know where he is too for a very different reason then they wanted to know he wanted to extinguish anything that was going to be a threat to his Empire so they all start asking around you know what they went back to the word they amen the Bible tells you and I've got it written down somewhere the Bible will tell you if you'll read it he consulted with the the the the priest and the scribes and they said well you know what we're going to go in our Scrolls and find out where this Messiah is supposed to be and when they went in the Scrolls they said he'll be born in Bethlehem of Judea they were close but they had found him the Magi followed what the heavens declared to them was his dwelling place on the earth hope you can follow this but it was the word that pinpointed his Dwelling Place not in Jerusalem and not in a stable at this point he was couple years old he was a young child he wasn't even in a stable any longer he wasn't a little infant drinking milk and eating his diapers changed he was a child now but the word pinpointed exactly where they would find him oh my now I want to I want to see this too and God help us if I don't get through this today I'll just stop somewhere and we'll pick it back up but I want you I want you to notice they all had an interest right Something's Happened on the earth we'd like to know what it is now now the the Magis or those wise men they were on a mission that was the whole reason they left their past yes sir that was the whole reason they left the what do they call those things the observatory they left the observatory representing the denominations they said we don't want to look from a distance we don't want to look at a at at at a Bible That's thousands of years old we want to know where he is we want to be joined with him we want to worship him we want to have an exchange we've got something Hallelujah to give him and we can't give it until we come into contact with him so they were on a mission and they were bound they were determined they' already left their homes their families their past their life their friends everything and they said we've left it all behind we don't care how far we have to travel we don't care what we have to give up we don't care what it involves as far as sacrifice or whatever the world thinks about us we will not be satisfied Hallelujah until we find him that was a revelation Revelation was driving them Amen brother and sister God put something in you that only he can fulfill amen and there's something in you that alone can fulfill God's desire for worship God will not be satisfied until you're back where you belong right in him so however far You' strayed or however dark or black your life may be amen he ain't even worried about that he's worried about getting you back and he's going to do whatever it takes to get you back because you fulfill him you are the missing part of himself amen and he cannot be complete without you back in him Hallelujah there's something drawing brother and sister it's beyond you it's beyond you you can't do it amen God have mercy but look at this they said we we we're going to keep going till we find him amen if he's not here we're getting out of this city and we're going to find him when they got out of the city the star reappeared and pointed him to the place where he was but now watch herod's attitude herod's attitude was well if you find him bring him to me isn't that the attitude of the make believer today well if it's true prove it to me yeah if it's true then what about all these websites yeah brother if it's true then what about this and what about that see you don't believe to begin with if you really believed you would forsake everything else until you find him but that was herod's attitude was well I'm going to stay right here I'm going to maintain my kingdom and my Affairs and all that I go I know I'm a king but if if there's another king that's supposedly rising up you bring him to me yeah and you you prove to me that he is who he says he is friend that he never got that proof he never became a Believer they never made the believer out of Herod that those Magis were and they said we don't have to bring him to us we're going to go to where he is we're not stopping until we find him amen friend I'm talking about Witnesses I'm talking about somebody who really is a witness amen they're not waiting for it to be brought to them on a silver platter they're going to go seek it out and search it amen until they find it to be the truth there's a difference oh my they were in the place where he was thought to be but discovered he wasn't there and when the chief priest says it's Matthew 2 4 and 4-6 that's where it describes when they consulted the word the word directed them to Bethlehem of Judea the word wasn't in Jerusalem it wasn't in a crib wasn't in a stable had matured and was being led by the Holy Ghost to bring it to its fulfillness now Christ is the revealed word of the hour in any age any period of time amen forever in history or even today Christ is the revealed word of the hour and the Holy Spirit was guiding the Lord Jesus amen even from infancy sir the Holy Spirit spoke to Joseph and Mary and said take him into Egypt until Herod is out of the picture it was protecting the life of the word amen it was protecting the word as it raised from infancy into its fullness into its maturity amen so the Holy Ghost will always guide the word or the Holy Ghost amen uh places the word where it belongs amen so um uh it wasn't in Jerusalem it wasn't in a crib it was it was in the home of Joseph and Mary and and the and and the the the the wise men found him there now now I want to go back to the scene and I I apologize I've been kind of jumping around is everybody all right amen let's let's uh I know what it was and maybe the Lord would just keeping me from it St John chapter 20 this is one of my favorite passages of scripture amen because I believe it shows us where we are today amen St John chapter 20 we'll just have a good Bible lesson today we're going to weave in some of the message amen sir the first day of the week I inan first one of uh St John 20 the first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early when it was yet dark to The Seer and seeth the stone taken away from the Seiler then she runneth and cometh to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved that was John and saith unto them they have taken away the Lord out of the Seiler and we know not where they have laid him now Peter you know he was very Vigilant and very uh how do I want to say it uh he had a lot of energy when it came to defending Jesus this is a man who only days before had smoked the high priest servant's ear off and I'm guarantee you he wasn't aiming for his ear no he was but he was he was a vem supporter of Christ oh Lord I won't deny you oh not me Lord amen and he was very uh very energetic IC and very vocal but he lacked the wherewithal Amen to to uh uh to to carry through on his statements of Faith he made very bold declarations but he didn't have the wherewithal Amen to to carry through with it all he was he was needing something that's right but it was jesus' choice and sometimes that's probably the only thing that's keeping us is the fact that we were his choice and he don't make any bad ones praise the Lord oh my they see she they came early they told Peter they've taken him away so Peter therefore went forth and that other disciple and came to the Seer so they they they ran both together and the other disciple did outrun Peter and came first to The Seer and he's stooping down and looking and saw the linen clothes lying yet went he not in then cometh Simon Peter following him and saith unto uh and went into the supper and seeth the linen clothes lie amen there was some proofs that he had been there but he wasn't there but I don't want just the artifacts I want him yes sir and the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes but wrapped it together in a place by itself then went in also that other disciple which came first to the supper and he saw and believed now he believed okay he's not here he's gone he's not where we left him he's not in the last place he's not where we thought he ought to be so he he he he he he he believed what his eyes told him he believed what his five senses told him then went in that saw and believe verse 994 as yet they knew not the scripture right that he must Rise Again from the dead friends that's where real faith lies is when you're latched onto the word despite what your senses declare to you that'll come that'll go but that word is a constant and when your faith is anchored into that brother and sister you are Rock Steady nothing's going to shake you amen now watch this now we we all got to agree here today these are Jesus disciples this is not Judas this is the 11 other faithful disciples that he chose and gave him positions in his administration and and brother he don't make bad choices but watch what his disciples do and John and Peter were not the lowest they were probably the two you know most uh closest to him perhaps James Peter and John definitely were and the only one missing here is James watch this then the disciples went away again to their own home we're out of here don't know where he is no he's not here we're going home we're leaving it's over you know but I want to look at Mary cuz that's our type amen but Mary stood without at the supper weeping and as she wept she looked down she stooped down and looked into the supper and seeth two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had laid where were these angels only moments before John had just been there Peter had just been there Mary had even been there and there was no mention of angels but to the one who wouldn't go home come on to the one who wouldn't give up to the one who said I'm not here for the pastor I'm not here for his son I'm not here for the song leaders I'm not here for the building I'm not here for the history I'm here to see him [Applause] amen I came here to worship him I came here to give him something I came here because I prepared something for him yes sir with no hope that he would ever do anything more for me amen and she just kept going back amen she wasn't leave that tomb she wasn't going to leave that place she had a Zeal she had a determination she had something within her that said I want to see him I'm not going to be satisfied I'm not going to give up I'm not going to turn around I'm not going to go join the pity party I'm not going to join the M naysayers I don't care if he can do anything for me or not I just want to be with him again she saw angels she received a supernatural visitation to show him to show her where he was I believe he's that same Angel today I believe if you've got that determination brother and sister I believe if you've got that Zeal you've got that fervency and that's what you come to church that's what you come to worship God will send an angel God will send the power of the Holy Spirit God will send a messenger he may send two of them from North Carolina to say he's not dead he's not a memory he's not history he doesn't have to be a 10-year-old testimony he can be alive and real in your heart today God is still God he's still on the throne amen they said un her woman why weepest thou she said to them because they have taken away my Lord and I know not where they've laid him when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw Jesus standing saw Jesus standing and knew not that it was Jesus Jesus said unto her woman why weepest thou whom seekest thou and she supposing him to be the gardener said unto him sir if thou have borne him hence now she you know there was there was a rumor that he had been stolen there was such a thing as Grave robbers and for all she knows she's talking to someone who has stolen him away or moved him to another place right she said if you will tell me where you've laid him I'll take them away if you'll show me where he is I'll make him my responsibility amen amen if you'll show me where he is I'll take him myself if nobody else wants him I'll take him if nobody else wants to be identified with them I'll take them if everybody else is ashamed of them I'll take them if you'll just show me where he is I'll take him on my hands and I'll finish what I started when I came there this [Music] morning there's some Mary somewhere that just wants to experience his presence one more time she don't care what the websites say she don't care about the history she don't care about the past she don't care about what his reputation is she knows what he did for her this is the marry that seven demons were cast out of and she said I know what I was before I met him amen he don't have to do one mother thing for me he don't have to heal me he don't have to save me he don't have to do one more thing for me but I got something I want to do for him thank you Lord John and Peter were his chosen disciples and both loved him but neither of them had the Zeal or the determination that she had her attitude was this I came to see him I Came To Worship Him I have something to offer him and I'm not going to quit just because things didn't turn out like I expected I'm here yes for him how many say that this morning this afternoon I'm here for him amen oh amen that that'll that'll that'll go somewhere this approach this attitude this determination will get results when you're not doing it for what it does for you amen but instead you do it all for him when you do it all for him you'll experience something greater she didn't give up she didn't go home home she didn't go back to her old life Peter went fishing the others went back to there she didn't go back to her old life she went back once more to the place where he'd been and she got a message she got a visitation the others didn't hear amen she saw somebody the others didn't see she saw him the one who had freed her from Satan's change amen I'm sure one of the reasons she loved him so was she never forgotten what he'd done for her and that witness led her to a greater witness and that gave her a message a witness and responsibility to the others amen I'll pick it back up here she's supposing him to be the gardener said sir if thou have borne him hits tell me where thou has laid him and I will take him away Jesus saith unto her Mary he called her name she turned herself and saith unto him raboni which is to say master listen to what Jesus told her he said touch me not for I am not yet ascended to my father now brother and sister we we could take some time on this but I won't Jesus had completed what was involved to restore the broken family prise God Amen he didn't just call disciples he was calling children he was redeeming lost attributes lost parts of himself he was calling back to himself but here he has risen from the deaden and now he appears to her and he says I he says don't touch me I'm not yet ascended to my father but go to my bre Breen yes right Brethren they had the same father Brethren they were of the same DNA hey Peter had denied him but he was still a brother he might have denied Christ but Christ would not deny him because he had something deposited down on the inside that Jesus knew at the upper room would be Quicken and he said go to my brethren and say unto them I Ascend unto my father and your father and my God and your God and Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples what that she had seen the Lord and that he had spoken these things unto her amen I want to say this this afternoon you can't see him and remain silent you can't see him and keep it inside you can't see him and not walk different amen she might have walked to that tomb one way but she walk back another and everybody say something happened to that lady something happened to her amen when the others went home when the others got defeated when the others closed the doors of the churches and said we're not going to do anything more until somebody returns she didn't she stayed right there she stayed right there and the two angels met her and then Christ himself met her and gave her a message go tell my disciples go tell my chosen go tell my bride go tell your discouraged brother go tell your discouraged sister go tell your son go tell your daughters go tell everybody we're not waiting on the prophet to return Jesus Christ is risen he's alive he's still saves he still heals he's still delivers he still fills with the Holy Ghost she got a message amen didn't make her a woman preacher but it showed the ministry of the Bride the bride's not wondering who's coming back she's in relationship with the god of his word she's been brought into an in isible Union of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride she's been impregnated with the word hallelujah she's a witness she's a witness of the Resurrection sir the resurrected Christ brought the broken family back together yes sir go to my brethren I send unto my father and your father to my God and to your God the true witness of his resurrected life will reunite his family amen here on the earth I believe today is a fellowship meeting there's there's a couple of churches amen represented here amen what are we gathering around friend the revealed word of the hour Christ amen the the broken body is not broken it's being reunited like ezekiel's Valley of dead bones can these bones live again son of man prophesy and when the word of the Lord went forth it brought the bones back together Amen to be the army they had they had once been yes sir oh my Lord help us St John stay in St John still in St John 20 verse 19 then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews what a bunch of Brave guys I mean friends if God himself is going to come to Earth in a body of Flesh and choose his cabinet members for his new Administration surely he depicted somebody with some courage right but they were not courageous no they wer they were a bunch of secury cats they were because they relied on his physical presence with them to get give them any confidence or faith but he's about to change that remember real faithfulness is proven in his perceived absence He's Not absent it just seems he's absent Hallelujah but he's still looking on when the three Hebrew children went into the fiery furnace it seemed that their God was absent but he was not absent he was proving their faith and he said wormwood they didn't stand for you Michael they didn't stand for you they stood for me their faithfulness in my perceived absence will bring me Hallelujah on the scene he that is faithful to the end the same shall be saved can you be faithful this morning can you remain true to the gospel I feel like preaching now friend there ain't no path back to Egypt for the bride if you got as far as you got with a tender hand of Jehovah raing quail and mana and water from the Rock and separating you from Pharaoh's Army how you going to get back without it there ain't no path forward except forward for the bride it's Onward Christian Soldiers marching as to war we're not going back to to denominations and he is not absent amen he is not absent he's present with the believer hallelujah boy I feel like preaching amen I feel a liberty in here this morning this afternoon amen I'm talking to some witnesses I'm talking to some Marys I don't care what others are doing I'm going I don't care what others are saying I'm going I didn't go for them I went for him and I'm not leaving till I beat [Applause] him oh oh oh oh Mary Mary listen you could take those precious spices and ointments and oils and and you could sell those on eBay pay your rent go maybe rejoin that church that struck you off the books when you follow that fanatic yeah she said listen as valuable as this is it doesn't have any value without him when I get into his presence he's what gives everything value he's what gives this value forsaking not the assembling of yourselves together as the manner of some is but the more so as you see that day approaching he's what gives our services value he's what gives value to your tithe to your offerings to your sacrifice amen yet may not be worth much to to the world but when he comes it makes it worth everything hallelujah praise the Lord just want to throw that in there amen oh my where am I the the doors were shut and the disciples were assembled for fear that use bunch of Scaredy Cats came Jesus and stood in the midst now that's going to make a difference that's going to make a difference and sayith unto them peace be unto you and when he had so said he showed unto them his hands and his side then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord am then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father hath sent me so sin I you am yeah now if you can't separate Jesus from God no you can't separate him from the holy spirit filled believer CU he said in the same manner and with the same format that I was sent now you are being sent friend was there anything beyond his power come on now no he was God expressed in a body of Flesh and if he sent those disciples the same way he was sent and we're one of them today amen How can there be any difference there cannot be amen oh my I know I got to close but I don't want to even as my father had sent me so send I you and when he had said this he breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost whosoever sins you remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain they are retained amen it was it was the amen it was the transfer amen of of his uh uh of his life his power and his authority he's now administering that to his disciples amen and he told them we know over in another gospel he said Terry ye in Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high that's right let me just find a few places I wanted to refer to we're bringing it to a close I want to show you the difference we've looked at Peter for a little bit this morning and brother bam is in a message called uh putting on the whole armor of God and he's he's talked about just he just been talking about how Peter had cut that high priest servant's ear off you know Peter wanted to prove he was a faithful disciple but every time the pressure was applied he he he yeah he he he disappeared so he didn't have it brother B said he could do he could say I belong to so and so I give you to understand but that wasn't what it was but when he seen the word manifested and denied it oh what a horrible thing that was but brother after Pentecost he went up and put on the whole armor of God he sure had courage then look at that same guy a Believer on Christ followed him hour by hour but he had only seen the word by letter he had only seen it manifested but now it was in Him Glory Hallelujah God's fiery word was burning in his own flesh what was it God in you amen Christ the hope of glory made manifest in a man in the church God know what he was doing yes sir it wasn't no more trust to this or trust to that or the other it was God himself then he stood up there and said ye men of Israel and ye that dwell in Judea heed my voice these are not drunk as you suppose this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel it shall come to pass in the last days saith God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and upon my handmaids and made servants no intellectual about that he had something what was it he had put the whole armor of God on Amen not so much as the high priest dressed but he had something inside of him amen the armor of God comes inside the spiritual hidden power of God that the intellectual eye doesn't see at all am Jesus never did say did you see it he said did you believe it amen amen you love the Lord this afternoon friend I believe this afternoon I'm addressing some real Witnesses right real witnesses to the Resurrected manif Ed Christ the revealed word of this hour amen I I wanted to to deal with something very quickly how many believe the proof of the Resurrection was not an empty tomb the proof of the Resurrection was those 120 that came out of the upper room with his same life dwelling within what is the proof of this message is it the pictures is it the testimonies is it the artifacts or is it the people amen whose lives have been changed amen there has been a transfer there has been a transfer brother and sister the life has come from the page into the believer the prophet spoke it but there's an army that is stood up the prophecy went forth but it has called Witnesses am amen the the the the the sounding forth of the trumpet has called an echo to Echo back an amen to the trumpet sound amen is more than your statement your amen is your action so be it isn't a statement it's an action your action is saying Amen to the revealed word of this hour amen I will restore sayith the Lord L Hallelujah Glory praise be to God brother Brown was pretty Pentecostal one the four the fourth light is to come that will bring forth the same signs watch justification brought back the pulp sanctification brought back the bark the doctrine of Holiness what brought back the leaf Pentecostals what is it Pentecostal leaves clap their hands Joy rejoicing Pentecostal what the fourth was the word itself he is risen he is risen from the dead the word made flesh fruits of the proof of the Resurrection sign that Christ has finally after justification been planted sanctification been planted baptism of the Holy Ghost and organizations died out and Christ has again centered himself like that cap of the pyramid sir first line justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost then the coming of the cap what is it the Holy Ghost being honed out so that it can fit Oh Glory with the same kind of ministry that he had when he went away oh my friend I can't read it without getting excited that when he comes back it'll catch the whole thing in the Rapture where the Justified Sanctified and baptism of the Holy Ghost that pyramid will stand again the house of of God will live again the tree of life is growing again praise the Lord I I looked up that word proof and what there's many definitions but one of them says a coin you know a coin is made by something that is stamped down they take a stamp and and stamp it down on metal and it forms that coin I I just uh was ministering Wednesday night over at a church in gast I gave the pastor there I pulled the change out of my pockets I'm a I'm an Apostolic preacher Silver and Gold Have I None but I had a little bit of loose change Brother Louis and I pulled out of my pocket and I had a 1946 wheat penny I said brother uh he's from Africa rich I said brother do you know what a wheat penny is he said I don't think I've ever heard of it I said a wheat penny is worth more than a penny it may say one cent on it but it's worth more than one cent and this was a 1946 week Penny then somebody told me said the reason they're worth more is because they're made of real copper right the pennies you have nowadays are an alloy of Cheaper metals that are given an an assigned value of one set but a wheat penny is real copper that's right amen so it's worth more than even a penny but they call one of the definitions of proof is a coin that is Struck from a highly polished diey on a polished planchet and is not intended for circulation that's right what do they do with that proof they frame it and put it on the wall and say that's a proof and sometimes differs in metallic content from coins of identical design struck for circulation right and I thought that sounds exactly like something Uncle Sam would do he would make a proof out of something valuable frame it and put it on the wall say that's a proof but Jesus didn't do that his are intended for circulation if you're the proof you need to circulate you need to be spent you need to be used you need to be poured out and you need to be refilled you need to be taken the message to your coworker to your husband to your wife to your family reunion you need to be circulated and you are not made of of a different material you are everything that he is he poured himself out brother and sister and you are the answer you are the proof and when you are tested you will react the same way he did Hallelujah now that's the proof of his resurrection as I live so shall you live also because I live you shall live also brother is that the proof you desire to be that's the proof I desire to be and we are by the grace of God burn burn Holy Spirit burn in me let's stand set my soul a fire fill me with the Holy Ghost and God's full desire

resurrected and looked 50 years old that's right I've always told him my God is not old amen my God's a young man if we're going to be 20 he's 20 and he ain't never changed he just took on a Corporal body so that he could what die for us but I believe when he come out of that tomb he didn't look like the Jesus that they knew that's right he looked like a young Gardener to Mary cuz Mary didn't see him at 20 years old his mama was the only one of that group that ever saw him at 20 years old the disciples that's why they couldn't believe it brother Solomon that's why they kept looking at Jesus the two from a mess they were they were Believers and he walked right there with them it wasn't so much that that Jesus changed their eyesight they were looking at a young man he didn't come out of that tomb old he come out of that tomb in at theophany body that stood and said let there be light and it wasn't an old god with an old stick you know and baldheaded and and gray my God ain't never been that way no you look at all the world though they depict him as that they depict him as an old man with a old beard you know uh-uh no if we going to have a youth camp we're going to have a youthful preacher there right called Jesus Christ he's never been old he got old because of you right he got old because of you and me but when he come out of that tomb he said all power amen and Heaven and Earth has been given unto me and then I'm going to give it to the bride to prove that he's not dead but he's alive and alive in a bride that I'm looking at today we're the only people that can respond to this most people just look at you like with this funny look on their face it's like brother Ram said they can't get him off the cross oh yeah we know Jesus died 2,000 years ago we know that that that he resurrected uh on on on Sunday morning back 2,000 years ago well what you doing for you now exactly amen right yes sir that's right Christ is the mystery of God revealed but where is Christ Paul said it's Christ in you the hope of glory that puts it all together you and I are little Messiahs you and I are the expression that God wanted before the foundation of the world he knew we'd be here he knew this light would cross your path and he knew you would respond to it one way or the other right amen still believe in predestination but I do believe in Free Will I believe you got a choice amen what is election God voted for you the devil voted against you you're the one that swings the vote two to one yeah you're the two to one on either side you're the tiebreaker you're the one that swings the boat so it's up to you today sir don't leave this place without knowing Jesus Christ don't leave this place without without without having the healing that you deserve the word that you deserve was given to you today amen the world don't deserve this oh we'd love to take it to them but they're not going to hear it that's right exactly but boy when somebody that knows the same daddy that the man's SP up standing up here talking about yes sir that same Daddy's inside of you the same man that stood here and talk to you was inside of you that's the way you respond yes you know brother Solomon you know how you know why we can read the Bible the way we read it cuz the one that wrote it's inside of you that's right so when you're looking down at it there's no mystery cuz your eyes he's looking through your eyes that's right we had an old brother here one time brother Sher and he said the devil would just beat on him and he said he'd open his Bible he said okay devil if you're going to beat on me he said me and you going to read the Bible me you going to read the Bible he said you look through these eyes we going to read this Bible right here and he said the dev would just go away from him he hates the word the devil hates the word of God and he hates it that you know what you're talking about he hates it he wants to keep us blind and keep us beat down no no no no amen listen this is not a cruise ship it's a battleship that's right we come with swords not spoons and forks we're fixing to go eat something with spoons and forks but you eat something with a sword today amen there was a sword pulled whatever you need whatever you need yes right here today there's a sword has been pulled yes and when there's a sword pulled there's a battle that's right whoever wins you know what brother R said he said he said you can take that uh to the enemy he said but it takes a strong arm of Faith that's right to jab it in there you can have the biggest sword in the world you can have the biggest you can have the biggest weapon in the world but if you don't know how to use it that's right right it's worthless you might kill more people than you know collateral damage than you if you didn't know what to do it but the bride knows what to do with the word right and when she draws a sword the devil ought to be shaking in his boots right cuz we know how to use it and we know where his heart is we know where his deception is remember brother Brown said we have Satan's answer right down through the church ages nobody had Satan's answer that's right that's right they were bouncing around like ping pong balls but today brothers and sisters we have the answer there is no other answer there is no other message coming there is no other age coming all right I'm going to preach let's let's sing one more song and then we'll we'll go down and eat they ready okay they're ready downstairs so visitors go first don't don't lolly gag around though cuz we hungry too let's sing one song as we dismiss amen sing the original amen we appreciate our brother we're going to do it again tomorrow but you enjoy yourself today and just enjoy yourself and and
