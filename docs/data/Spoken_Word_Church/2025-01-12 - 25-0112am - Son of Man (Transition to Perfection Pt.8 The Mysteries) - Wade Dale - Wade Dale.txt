shovel and clean it out for me well um I had to put him off yesterday but it's a funny thing how the Lord works and I was telling this young brother I said you know I'm 75 years old and I wonder why I'm still here I should have done been gone several times and I said but you know we got to talking a little bit and I found out it was a I knew it was Baptist just the way he responded to the word while the other people around us just went on about their business working and I got talking to him and it just come out it just unfolded about acts 238 and I was explaining to him that because of today's message has hit this Earth and you can look around and see everything is happening for a reason and I explained to him about acts 238 and of course Matthew 289 about the name and I said I've been going a little thing in the Bible every time I see that we'll see his name he wants us to know his name even on back in Psalms on back before all the way through his Bible he's wanting us to know his name and that makes it a personal relationship to us and here I am standing there with a guy that's cleaning out a septic tank talking about the Lord now go figure and he got a lot out of it and

conversation because it is written be ye holy for I am Holy thank you for the reading of the words you may be seated amen amen thankful for the word of God you know it is true that there's all types of judgment um going around last night I was reading an article off of one of the news websites and I guess last week or um yeah it was sometime this week they they had the Glo it's like global awards or something in in Los Los Angeles there and this article was talking about how I didn't watch it but they had the video clip there and I guess one of the announcers she was you know people they win Awards and they get up and have their speeches and they'll say I thank God I think this person this person and she actually showed she said we're going to take a poll of uh who all she said and it is the wording of it that was very strange she said these speeches are on fire and we're going to take a poll of how many people thinked you know their mother and this and they came up with God and it said zero and everybody laughed and she said it's no surprise in in this Godless town and one day later the fires broke out now they've always had fires out west but not like this this has been one of the historic worst fires and so the article is saying you you don't mock God even if if you respect the faith but when you put them on National TV like that and say in this Godless town it's no nobody thank God and now look what's happening you know it's the end time but you know there's a bride that has a fire too it's not judgment it's an anointing it's that same anointing that fell on the day of

to be closed on Wednesday I think cuz there was so many out with the flu so Lord I pray that you would just take that away from each one father that's a a hard thing to do we know there's no cure by man of the flu but we're not talking to man today we're talking to a god that can do all things and heal all of our diseases so Lord we place them in your hands father that you would raise them up for your honor and Glory so be with us in further on this service Bless the people that has to move on the highways today that you'll bless them be with the ones that are sin siake father the ones that need you Lord time's getting short Lord I pray that you would touch their heart today Lord that you would soften that thing up and change their heart so that they'll come to you father we ask these things in Jesus name and the bride says amen so we're we're talking about they still in the transition to per Perfection this will be part eight we'll talk a little bit today about the Mysteries because that's what we have to get into to get into the meat of the message to get into the to the Malachi 4 second part of it you have to deal with the Mysteries and let me tell you something the Bible tells us we can understand it amen the soul always knows what to do to heal itself the challenge is to silence your mind how do we overcome we overcome by what the blood of the lamb and our testimony which comes from our brain that we're testifying good things not bad things all right so let's read 1 Corinthians 2:9 you see that okay but as it is written I have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him what a promise amen but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit now may not be that we do hello but the spirit inside of you is what searches for the Deep things of God it should in this end time but for the spirit searches all things yay the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of a man now watch save the spirit of man which is in him I can relate to man because I'm a man or Humanity I can relate to humanity cuz I'm a human all right now even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God so the spirit of God's got to be inside of you so that you can understand God that's right all right now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know look that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God one more before we sit down Matthew 13:5 I thought this was this was very striking some fell this is a a parable of the sword some fell upon Stony places where they had not much Earth and forth with they sprung up because they had no deepness of Earth now if you look in the strong concordance that is translated to the depth of God so because they had no depth of God when the sun came up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away you may be seated the Lord that his Blessing to the reading the word I thought that was striking because when you go to that word depth of God or the Deep things of God it goes to the word deepness which comes here in Matthew and that's exactly the truth some are falling by the wayside now because the Heat's coming the Heat's here if you're not ready for the S so n the Su n but the s o n if you're not ready for the s o n you're going to get scorched amen is that all right I don't want to scare anybody but listen there's time when we got to get out of here and getting out of here if it's just the way it is now we should already be gone but we're not we're still here that's right we're still what we're trying to get the Deep things of God into our soul so that it can work its way out and then we can live the life that God always wanted us to live now we'll look at that here a little bit later down through here on some of the Mysteries that we're going to get started on starting in a couple of weeks Matthew 17:9 as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged him saying tell division to know man until the son of man be risen again from the dead in other words he was describing to him I'm going to die here physically but there's going to be a time that when the son of man's going to be killed again amen amen and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come so so the Lord is telling us by the holy spirit that we're going to have a place and time on Earth where there's going to be an Elijah come an Elijah Ministry come and restore us back to the faith of the fathers restore us back to the original word now listen there's going to be a group that's going to carry us away from that denomination a li truly shall first come and restore all things now in other words to restore something like brother Donnie had gets an old car I remember they got an old 30s something Cadillac in one time and that was the ugliest thing I ever seen in my life the tires wasn't even on it they were laying up on the top of it but you give some master the right tools and give him the right parts and give him the right time to do it in he will absolutely restore that whole car and it will become a beautiful car they don't make them like they used to before that was a that was I what y'all do with that brother Donnie that big old Cadillac thing y'all got in had that like V10 the engine was about this long and it had a wheel in the back and cloth on top it it was it was fine for the time but it looked like time had took its toll but if you take it and give it to somebody a master builder he will restore it back and that's what God sent us he sent us a master builder to restore what had been eroded down through the church ages by man right now not by God by man you put man in every equation he falls he can't even keep a covenant right we can't keep a covenant I trust in God's covenant right cuz it's an unconditional Covenant it's a covenant that says I'm going to do this I will will change your body you won't be able to change it God's going to have to change it amen so let's quit trusting in oursel trust in God Amen so God did send us Elijah the prophet Malachi 4 he sent us Elijah number four before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord we see now the Dreadful day of the Lord is coming it's it's here amen and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth Earth with the curse now we know that Elijah number three which was John the Baptist he turned the heart now listen what is the heart soul you can change things physically but unless you change the soul you're dead you can look good you can fix yourself up you can get BOTOX whatever you want to get you're still going to be old but I'll promise you once you get get the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul you'll never be old again you will never ever be old again you will be Eternal for eternity am and you'll start it right here go this is that Elijah ministry that's coming now we don't need that Elijah listen we will not need that Elijah Ministry number five right it's not to us it's to Israel right we have to have number four because he's to the G genes that Elijah is preaching to the Gentiles and bringing a people out a bride in the end time that's going to be turned back from their old ways and brother brandom Comon as we're going to see in a minute when he indicted this generation he just didn't indict a generation he indicted them all the way from Calvary to today I mean to today because remember when a prophet speak he speaks behind present forward amen and that's what we're looking at today the word of God is what Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so we can stand today like I said before there is no way that I can indict a generation brother brandham had to do it a prophet had to do it by the word of God by the opening of the seals he indicted a generation now remember an indictment brings you into court right then you have to have a trial right then you have to have what conviction or not amen then you have to have someone to carry out the sentencing everybody with me now all right bring them into court indict them give them the evidence this is what's happening everybody with me all right then you come over here and you got to bring the evidence which we know brother ROM did his whole message is the evidence that they fell away from their first love his whole message was they turned away from the true Living God right then you got to have a conviction and he convicted them that day when he said I indict you for crucifying christ and then he proved that they crucified him amen he proved by the word of God he didn't prove by Brother bram's message he proved it by the word of God amen now we prove it by the word of God and we see it in the message of the hour but let me give you a secret brother brandom's off the scene now there was a conviction who's going to carry out the sentence brother randam can't carry it out somebody's going to carry it out right here cuz it's this it's an indictment that they're crucifying today aresh and put him to an open shame even the people in the message that are preaching false Doctrine they're doing the same thing this is not just for denomination folks you preach a false Doctrine you're killing Jesus Christ right that's why everything's got to be right that's what brother and I were talking the other day we've got to realize I know there's different message churches I know there's different factions and there's different ideas but I'll promise you one thing look at me just for a minute the son of man never had an argument with the father righten exactly he never said now I don't know if he meant that or not now if the son of man Ministry is to be right here today alive and among us today there can't be any error right not one word Jesus came back to get us out of the garden of and put us back in the Garden of Eden with that one word that got us out right amen he said you believe in me believe in me and I'll take you back there but man said no I don't want any of that I want my own ideas I want to do it my own way is that not right so brother R took this from Luke 23:33 he said when they were come to the place which is called Calvary There They Crucified him and the maleactors one on the right and one on the left now remember there where the most religious city right they the most religious people not the Sinners and prostitutes and robbers thieves crucified the most horrible death that could be of that time that was the most horrible death him the one that didn't ever need to be crucified never had a never had a uh a day where he was a sinner but he became sin for us he took on our sin when he went to Calvary he said I'll do it but he said not my will but thy will be done well now remember that wasn't a fight CU he went to Calvary brother Brown said he fought it out in Gethsemane he didn't win at the cross he went he win he won in Gethsemane what when he got on his knees and prayed and said father let this cup pass for me but nevertheless not my will but thy will be done can we say that today never nevertheless does it come what may not my will but thy will be done can you lay it on the altar today can we lay it down and say this is it right here amen oh my brother Lise he was a Pentecostal Wednesday night that was a good sermon yes sir that was good I enjoyed that I like when people get excited amen what do we get excited about what was said the word of God that he brought is what we get excited about not because he was jumping around so brother Brown comes and he forms an indictment now this word indictment means a formal charge or accusation of a serious crime now for a traffic violation you don't get indicted you go before the court you pay the fine or you or you contested or whatever more but if you have a serious crime capital offense or a federal offense or a felony or something of that sort that's a serious crime they must indict you according to the evidence that's given now brother brandom he all through his time he was he was bearing with them and bearing with them and bearing with them I talking to a brother the other day uh Brother David gadman and a couple others who were standing around when we went over to to uh to Brother David templeton's the other night we were talking about about this I asked him I said look I'm going in March to preach for a a Methodist Church if you got a problem with that you got a problem if brother ryham would have said I ain't going to them places the problem is that you're so weak you're afraid you're going to get something when you go there they ain't way they ain't going to see nothing but God when I go over there and Brother David Gman said I preach for Baptist Church another brother standing there he said well I preach for the Pentecostal Church I don't have a problem with that would you have a problem with it I didn't think so but do what take me with you take okay well we're going March the 30th down to Silver shs in Commerce and and uh okay I'm not going to preach There They Crucified him I'll promise you that but I'll guarantee you there'll be some things they never heard before and they asked me to come I didn't get at the front door and go can I preach for you come on I'm sure glad as I say before I'm glad brother brandham didn't say bless God I'm not going to them denominations no here's my point from 47 to 63 that's where he was at there was no message church at all he had to preach in the free will he had to preach in the Baptist he had to preach in the Methodist how do he get armman Neville he got him out of a Methodist Church did he not right so don't be afraid that listen if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul there's no one no one on earth going to change your mind no one I don't care if you sit in a Methodist church and they give you Methodist Doctrine you ain't going to sit there long no you're just not going to sit there long right right I'm glad Jesus listen Jesus tried to go to the religious people of the world he preached to them but they hated him so there was and listen brother random was fine we'll read it here we read it many times before when brother Brandon first started his ministry he was wise as a serpent and harmless as a dove when Jesus Christ started his ministry if you if you all that are watching The Chosen he started out real quiet he got his disciples together but I'm going to tell you something you get in about the end of season three to season 4 he said it's fixing to get bad why because he come he said I have something to do Jesus said I have something to do I have lived with you long enough even told the Pharisees he said have I not been among you in the temple have I not walked among you what's the problem now he said oh you're making yourself God he was trying to get them to believe he was God he came exactly the way he was supposed to come brother brandham came exactly the way he was supposed to come listen one more time you and I came exactly the way we're supposed to come you and I bring it personal you and I came the exact way we were supposed to come there's no other way you could have come this is it right doesn't matter what you well my past and I don't know my dad and I don't forget that Paul said forgetting the past Paul had to forget a lot because Paul looked at those Christians and called them blasphemers and put them in prison the very ones that he's preaching to now that's right so it's a formal charge or accusation of a serious crime listen eternal life is serious that's right being right is serious a thing that that serves to illustrate that a system or situation is bad and deserves to be condemned brother Ron was preaching 47 to 63 but remember 1959 he preached why am I against organized religion why I am against organized religion and he kind of if you'll watch that he kind of little vanilla there you know he was kind of laying it out there but I'm telling you in 1963 when the seals broke I told you the indictment was not preached until two or three months after the seals open he said he was going to do it in January he said he was going to do in December he had to work wake all wait all the way through March and April May June July he brought the indictment down I'm telling you only a prophet can bring an indictment right to a group of religious people because who was the greatest prophet in the world that was Jesus Christ he brought an indictment condemned deserves to be condemned now listen not the people the system right but you got to remember one thing if you stay in that system you are that system the system only works if people are there amen amen if every Baptist was quit being Baptist there'd be empty Baptist churches around here but they're not they're caught up in the system and you know who's going to be condemned number one is the people in the pull pit the people in the pull pit that's why if you want to stand back here have at it it's not a nice place to be right my words are on trial just as much as everybody else's is so 1962 this is in December brother Brown preached a reproach for the cause of the word Jesus called them Hypocrites you build the tombs of the prophets and you're the one that put them there they come with the word of God and you didn't believe them you're guilty of every one of them at Phoenix God willing I hit a word the other day I'm going to indict this generation for Killing Jesus Christ now who's Jesus Christ he's the word all right so they didn't physically care Jesus you know that they killed the word the effects of the word crucifying him aresh I'm going to bring an indictment before that Ministerial Association now remember he wanted to get a bunch of ministers together cuz that's where the problem is remember what brother rown said he said the only problems I have is when I get around preachers now he said that I didn't they are guilty of the blood of Jesus Christ for crucifying him aresh in indict the whole Peter indicted him on the day of Pentecost he said you with Wicked hands have crucified the Prince of Life who God raised up we Are Witnesses he brought an indictment I'm going to take now remember he didn't just say I'm going to indict you because I'm William Mar brandham I'm God's Prophet for the end time no he did not he said I'm going to take the word of God and indict every denomination there is and every man on the face of the Earth that's guilty of the blood of Jesus Christ God helped me to be his attorney at that day he's the only one that could be the attorney cuz remember God only reveals things to the prophet first so he revealed it to the prophet first but now listen it don't stop there Amos 3 and9 or what at 2 or nine whatever it was that didn't just well God's going to reveal it to the prophets and then brother Jose we just got we're just sitting here no he gave it out to a group of people 1100 sermons were were taped so so that you and I could take that message and we can carry it on to the coming of the Lord yes sir we are here today the messenger is not but the voice of the message is here the final voice I'll show you what in a minute I'll prove to you who's going to carry out the sentence cuz you got if you have a sentencing right if you have an indictment and then you have evidence then you have a conviction you got to carry out the sentence remember the conviction comes on a day not the sentencing you never been to court before just watch every once in a while don't watch Court TV Judge Judy is not a judge she's a she's a actor she is a judge but all that's garbage but if you take a regular process once there's a conviction the judge will stand up and say on such and such day it could be two months from now right cuz they got to have some little things in there that are that are the legality of it then we'll have the sentencing on a certain day well brother bandam convicted them there's no doubt but there had to be a sentence carried out and the sentence had to be carried out not in another dimension right right think about it my indictment is against the churches of today now this is not this is the indictment so here we go and my indictment is against the churches of today now I'm not bringing the center into this I ain't just speaking this to the church it's to be on tape now I'll try to get through as quick as I can I indict this generation the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ and now to do this in this age that we live in I must show an Evidence can't just indict he got to show an Evidence if I have to bring an indictment you have to show an Evidence of the criminal offense that has been done I have to indict them I have to bring the evidence to prove it that it is that what I'm saying look how confident he is what I'm saying will stand up before the main judge right wow which I take myself as an attorney on this indictment that the word of God being my witness I indict this generation for the crucifixion I must show and will show that The Same Spirit is on the people today that brought the first crucifixion that's a mouthful that's a revelation you mean that same yes that same spirit that confronted Jesus on the road in out in and out of Jerusalem in and out of Judea Bethlehem all those different places that they confronted him that same demon that caused them to do that is sitting here today now I don't mean sitting here but it's in this it's in this religious realm today amen and they're gonna do the same thing if they if they kicked him out then they going to kick him out now if they killed him then they're going to kill him now listen the true message of the hour is the only way to get out of this conviction amen right that's right because remember there is a group that's not guilty we always worry about the guilty yes there is a guilty party but there's some that the judge is going to stand up and he said I don't see what they're doing all I hear is the word of God through their voice through the blood speaking to me oh what a happy time it should be folks amen and I'll promise you I'll read you a quote in a minute you've been heard it before but it's going to mean a lot more today I hope than it's ever meant to you before so he's going to S The Same Spirit that's on the people today brought the first crucifixion doing the same thing I must do that if it's going to be a crucifixion that they've crucified I must show to the people that the same attitude in the people today is doing the same thing spiritually they did in the physical then it could not have been done a few years ago I say 50 years ago could not have been done but today this is very timely and it could not have been done maybe 10 years ago he narrows it down more right but it can be done today because the time has run out in other words the seals are open the revelation of who that man of sin is and where he's sitting right cuz you and we'll read it when we get in the seal brother Brown said now I know now I know he thought he knew back then he said now I know why I hate that thing so much now I know why I've been so against these organization right and then what did they do they turned him out and he preached to 30 or 40 people in a trailer some of the greatest message you ever preached to you know a couple hundred people are you with me therefore the time for repentance for a nation is gone so God's not going to ever save a nation again the only nation he promised to save is Israel right he promised to preserve them and keep them and then take 144,000 out of them and then all hell's going to break loose you think it's bad in California now you just wait right if you sit down and look at the catastrophes the tsunamis even the earthquakes like that when it was overseas not long ago that killed thousands of people just you know things collapse talk about a 300 mile chunk of Earth how many miles wide it's 300 miles long I know but anyway that's bigger than Jamaica Jamaica's only 150 Mi across this way and 50 Mi this way it's like that whole chunk and that's where that 20% of the population of the United States is out there think about it think about what's going to happen when that thing goes under and you're going to feel it all the way out here get into Christ folks get into not trying to scare your kids anybody but you better get into Christ if you don't get into Christ you're going to be just like them people out there now that standing there looking at their house and it just completely disappears amen and when that thing slides off into the ocean folks I'm telling you there's going to be floods like you never seen there's going to be other earthquakes right amen there's going to be fires they can't contain EMS will not be able to get to certain people pipelines are going to bust internet things are going to that's Silicon Valley out there and water and electronics don't mix so when that thing slides off boom I'm just telling brother brandom's already give the conviction he already brought the evidence and he's already convicted them now we're waiting on the sentencing right so the conviction watch that's the only place he meets with man today is under the shed blood of the sacrifice I don't care if you're Methodist Baptist Presbyterian if you can forget your differences Roman catholic whatever you might be and will come under the shed blood God will will meet with both of us there right that's where we can meet all can all meet and fellowship on the same ground but otherwise he will not meet just because you're a Methodist he will not meet just because you're Pentecostal he'll not meet because you're a brand a brandom Believer or a message believer you got to be a word believer an end time word believer believer not unbeliever they turned into unbelievers now they don't believe what he said they don't believe it was a prophet they don't believe this they just turn into unbelievers that's where we can all meet but otherwise he will not meet you as a Methodist Pentecost Presbyterian he'll meet you under one condition that's under the shed blood now look he's bringing he's bringing it he's telling them the shed blood the shed blood you you can only get under the shed blood what now remember brother R said one time the bleeding word of God all right so we know the word of God In The Blood we know there's not blood running down on top of us we know there's not blood in the hands and oil and all that stuff brother R was talking about it's the bleeding word of God when you open that word of God and you read it that's what covers you is the shed blood of Jesus Christ by the word of God and you got to believe that's what'll take it away from you right that's where you become Believers I don't know if God can you're an unbeliever Jesus said I can do all things Paul said I can do all things Peter said I can do all things through Christ who what strengthens me amen now watch he'll meet you under one condition that's under the shed blood when your sins has been confessed and expelled in his presence then by the blood all right everybody with me so it's a bleeding word it's the word of God is what they've turned down so they've turned the blood down right come on they've turned the blood down they've turned the power that was behind the blood they turned that down everybody with me all right I'm building a case here and the blood is always before him the blood is always before him this is the only way he can judge you is by this right here amen and he judged his son at Calvary to take your place right if you get underneath that he you can't see your sin what happened is they couldn't they they took the blood and said no it's not the blood we know he died on the cross but I'm not going to get under that no I'll have to change my ways attitude dress hair where I go what I do what I think I'll have to change well praise God change me if you are if you're fine the way you are God help you I mean really if you're just satisfied with the way you are God help you the devil's already got you he'll meet you under one condition that's under the shed blood when your sins has been confessed and expelled in his presence then blow the blood now what is he telling them in this indictment he's saying there's a way to be not guilty everybody with me he's building the case for the unbeliever but he's trying to tell them look there's a way out there's a way to become a Believer there's a way to have what what is sin unbelief unbelief in what the doctrine of the word of God that's right this is where the unbelief is at they they don't believe this oh no they don't believe what I tell them well if you tell them the word of God what did God tell that Prophet one time he said they didn't reject you he said they reject me right they're rejecting me not you so now I'm building a case and I'm going to give you something here in just a second the blood is always before him therefore he can only see you through that shed blood and you're white as snow when you've confessed all your sins how many people believe that well for you unbelievers there's your way out listen there is a way out it's called Grace it's called Grace amen because the law will put put you in jail and the blood of an animal cannot cover you but when you take the blood of Jesus Christ let confess it it's all you got to do confess with an honest heart not say well if I did it I'm sorry no there ain't no if about it you did it and you're white as snow when you've confessed your sins otherwise look you're not there you cannot Fellowship that's right cuz remember God's not going to fellowship with unbelief that's why he's not fellowshipping with the denomination come on he's not fellowshipping with them today brother Brown listen I believe when a prophet says something that that that it changes the course of things when brother Ram stood that day and he described denominations as lodges nothing more than a place to meet like the Moose Lodge he said every church that's a denomination is a lodge I tell you what I am going to do preaching that Methodist Church March the 30th but I'll promise you they won't be no church order there why they've kicked God out amen there's no conviction right they have they have they have just totally seared their like that woman that said I I can see my um mother's soul in Hell fry and laugh at it why she had brother BR said she had seared everything away and there's no way God could get to her well there's no way God can get to an idea of a denomination they've got to come out of that they got to come out from under that and get out the blood right so where is the blood you say well brother it's the word amen hold on now watch that's the reason that you don't see things happening in the churches remember brother R said one unconfessed sin cause the whole church to fail one that's right amen yes sir Lord help me when you walk through that door be honest with yourself stop for a second and say God whatever I've done bring it to my attention and I'm going to pray I don't need people listen amen I don't need the pastor to lay hands on me not for that no no no that's between you and God right I can't pray a spirit off of you that you like no way if you like it you're going right back to it then brother Bown say I cast it out of her and they said well brother ra she went back same he said she loved that Spirit but she had a choice listen there was a new feeling when she came out from under that she just what she done was the unclean Spirit got thrown out and what happened was she didn't carry on with God and they came right back and she went back in the same place and got worse that's the same thing with us listen this is not playtime this is not a play pretty it's not something to take out and mold and put together and paint and make it no it's a life amen that's the reason you don't see things happening in the church they confess that they believe the blood but they reject the very plan to get to it right are you with can you read that they reject the very plan you know what plan they have a Baptist plan a Methodist plan you don't have to baptize we we sprinkle we we believe in a trinitarian Doctrine we believe there's eternal hell we believe we got to go through the Trib the very plan was what brother Brandon was bringing them the plan of God right and had brought them the plan of God all those years but they kept rejecting him they kept turning him down but they reject the very plan to get to the blood the word see there's only one way God will honor that word you'll never honor that word saying I'm a Catholic I demand this to be done you can't do it Methodist Baptist Pentecost you can't do it the only way you can do it is under the mercies of God through his grace amen is to come through the shed blood of Jesus Christ you're sitting here today under grace the grace of God brought you to to church the grace of God give you this message the grace of God let you hear this message now what are you going to do with [Applause] it look is to come through the shed blood of Jesus say Lord I claim the promise how many of us today Lord I claim your promise yes sir and you can put whatever you want to in there you can claim your family but you better claim yourself first right you better claim your salvation first cuz without your salvation there's nothing to there's nothing to give your kids there's nothing to give them if you ain't got it yourself you got to get it first this is a selfish religion to a degree you better get it yourself first but once you do it's the one thing you want to give away from then on cuz listen me and J was talking about coming up the road the other day we've got to realize that God when he gives eternal life it's like cutting a pie or breaking the bread and another piece Pops in its place you could give me a whole pie and if it come from God there'll be another pie there for somebody else don't think don't think God's going to get weak don't think you've asked too much from God I don't think we ask enough that's right of God Amen right now look God's not obligated to you though he's obligated to his word but you become the word then he's obligated to you because you plugged it in all right but first you've got to be under that blood all right everybody with me now watch who's going to carry out this indictment that there was a conviction and now there's an there's a sentencing 60 years later on Christ mystery of God revealed one of the greatest messages brother Brown ever preached he said if you miss in the seals come back to this message why because right here the church now remember it's the bride the church is the blood of Christ by the spirit right because the life is in the blood that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that baptizes us into his body that recognize is only his body his flesh and his word brother Brown Pats the Bible denominations won't never touch that it's a revelation she knows it so did Eve know it but she fell but this look this one knows it this eve and won't fall she is ordained Hallelujah she's ordained to not fall she won't fall she's pre predes destinated to it so someone must carry out the sentencing if it's a blood that you got to be under and the bride is the blood by the spirit then we're the word am eternal life has to come from somebody that has eternal life the seed life comes to the body you got to hear a preacher that's born again all not okay but someone must carry out brother Ram stood and I indict you I convict you if you stay the way you are you're dead right but there's a group of people that claim the blood they took my sins away they took your sins away put them under the blood and put them in that sea that God created a place where he can't even go to amen right right God created a place that he can't even get in right oh now my God can do everything mine can't I'm glad mine can't right I'm glad my God can't remember my sins cuz it's put in the sea of God's forgetfulness never to be remembered again he will never remember we remember the devil remember your neighbor remembers your brother remembers your sister remember your wife remember your husband remember but you got to get over that your soul don't remember it I promise you if you're born again you got to listen to what your soul says just like I said in that first part listen to your soul your mind is your biggest problem hallelu amen right I don't know how I can do this listen if you've been in the message 10 15 years you ought to know by now right I'm sorry we got to quit being kids you got to know by now like brother we said read your Bible pray study the message study the message amen amen I'll just come Sunday and you just give us what we need brother way you just give us a a a heap and pile no I just want put my pile on the pile you already got that you should have got setting it home or listen or going down the road listening to tape or studying or whatever you don't have to be like brother brother Dell said that brother Tony one time said now you got to get right in front of the Jesus picture and you know a lot of people now are getting before the brother Brandon picture you ain't got to do that you're individual God will approach you if you let him the way you are the Lord cuz he talks to me different than he talks to you right some people may I don't know brother Bob and him they've never told me but they may study a week for a sermon I didn't get this sermon till last night now you sit there and you running around in your head and you think well I'm going to put this together and and I remember this quote right didn't brother Bown say I went down and I the angel would tell me something and I would go in the scriptures well see he didn't have a message he was bringing the message now we have the Bible and the message to bring back to our remembrance that brother Ram said somewhere in the in the message that the bride is the blood by the spirit and if there's a sentencing to be carried out listen are you ready the sentencing can't be carried out by the convict that would be real strange they wouldn't be nobody in jail but the conviction has to be carried come on people the conviction has to be carried out with somebody's got power enough to stand there and say you're wrong I'm right that's what a judge does now judges are corrupt as they can be we know that but I'm talking about the righteous judge and remember if you and I have that righteous judge inside of you how you going to judge the Earth it's going to be judged by what you do yes and the people people that you're around you're going to judge them they're going to be judged by how they treat you how they treat you oh no that now they remember brother Wade you said they've crucified Christ yeah there's a group and if you don't believe the word of God you do it to same thing but if you come in under the blood message of the hour the Bride of the end time right and you listen listen birth pains 1965 these men if they pick up this preaching birth pains and goes out with it not stay at home and punch oh goes out with it Jesus said go in the all world and preach the gospel right go they can make more sense to it see to bring it to a place you would I just want to lay this seed then hope they make it come to life I believe a prophet he just gave us a commission as a five-fold Ministry to do that right there pick up this look that tea is thank God for some of them people in Jeffersonville that was smart enough to realize what this is right that's a capital T in the wrong place that not right what this this message pick up this message and go out with it amen and if we're the blood by the spirit listen God be blessed for seeing this wonderful Heavenly light in this last day praise God I say it myself because the church is doing the same thing today until the hour that organization religion is condemned and proved to be sacrificing Christ word okay condemned all right getting ready to be sentenced from then on comes the word and the word only now who's carrying it today five-fold Ministry in this message you can't carry it under a trinitarian Doctrine you can't carry it under a false Doctrine right yeah you can carry what he convicted but that's been dead that's dead that conviction is they're dead from the old Pascal lamb passed away and Christ became our lamb at the day of the crucifixion and the day that the denomination crucified the word of God and accepted a Creed in the stad of the word that's the day now watch I read this the other day did you really get this that's when the word became so weak and unpower and and there was I mean we just wowy wowy woo and we go over the corner and suck her thumb no he said that's the day the word comes into full effect this is what God wanted right he wants to show a group of people that'll stand up on the word of God he's going to show brother Bram said just for a moment God's going to show the bride to the earth I believe that under that third pole you're going to see some things you've never seen before but you better get in it cuz I just reading it the other day and I believe somebody brought it out oh brother Andrew over Brother David the third poll is to a group of people that can't be saved to the bride church for the church what to condemn them tell them they need to be bride and two the totally lost that cannot be saved then brother Brown continues on and he says they'll continue on and think they're getting saved they'll keep saying they're getting the Holy Ghost why because they didn't get the right way to begin with come on I believe the message I got a feeling I gotta put I gotta put I feel the pull what's it pulling you to that's my question what's it pulling you too there is a third pull it's for the bride it's pulling us out of here condemning the church and preaching to the totally lost today I indict this bunch of ordained ministers in their Creeds and denominations they are crucifying to the people they they the Ministerial Association are crucifying to the people with me the very God they claim they love and serve listen without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can't serve God in agap love amen it's all filo it's all feelings it's all emotion it's all that right right CU remember a God love it don't have a condition just one trust me I indict these ministers in the name of the Lord Jesus upon their doctrine that claim that the days of Miracles is passed and that the water baptism in the name of Jesus is not sufficient and not right upon any of these words that they have substituted Creeds for I indict them now watch here it is as guilty all right they've been convicted right yeah right he brought he brought the indictment he brought the evidence now he brought right here the conviction I indict them as guilty and the blood of Jesus Christ upon their hands who is the blood of Jesus Christ today you and I that's why this world is the way they are it's because we're still herea cuz we're still here for crucifying a fresh the Lord Jesus the second time they are crucifying Christ to the public taking from them the thing that they're supposed to be giving to them and they substituted something else in its place a church Creed for popularity and today the church does the same thing it denies the word they don't want it they're preaching millions of people today around the world open this Bible right and preach the message I didn't say the message I said a message and it was dead the Letter's not dead I mean the letter the word's not dead when he takes that word and he looks at that and he sees and he says hey we must believe in the Blessed Holy Trinity and do all those things he has took the word of God and crucified it right amen cuz that's not under the shed blood that's why you and I listen I'll show you in a minute that's why you and I had to come out from under come out of her come out of those things that's right and come under the blood the bleeding word of God not a substitute now they're living under a substitute you and I are living under what the grace of God a human died for us well God died for us well a human body with human blood that had the life of God died for us okay now we believe and see that it's not just a literal function it's not just the blood chemistry brother Brown said but it's the life that was in the blood that's right and you and you and I are what the life of God on this Earth there is no other life of God on this earth except the Bride of Jesus Christ how many can say amen amen amen yes me and you you say wow now brother you're being too we ain't got close enough yet that is our problem will you really are we what become an unbeliever IT denies the word they don't want it it's contrary to what they've been taught to believe by their Creeds now watch I didn't bring this quote because I didn't find it quick enough and the word is the Messiah you believe that everybody with me now what did Brother Ram call us what did our prophet in the end time call us mid Messiah so the word is the Messiah and he had Messi you know there's we sometimes we take this over here and we say now well brother M told us that there was a harlot and she had daughters right churches well praise God we got a God over here that's real and he's got children right he's got churches that believe him the word is a Mah you believe that now watch well the reflection of the word then is what a reflecting of Messiah watch which is the Holy Ghost Among Us he is reflecting himself tries to wherever he can find a lamp that he can look through that ain't smoked up with Creeds and things he can give light through that now we've read this before but we're going to read it again and then we'll close here in just a second this is this quote to me brings everything relative to the whole message amen and what it was then and what it is now all right because remember the message of Malachi 4 is to do two things so they're two when he say when you say two things me and brother Josie are two things we're two humans we're not one we're two he is a human and I'm a human he has a name I have a name all right so there's two things that this messenger is going to do all right this is from the church age book now this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelations 10:7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers right Babylon Pentecostal babies that are baby Christians right B be Christians he's trying to get them to digest the word of God and eat and become adults right and become adults but what happened to the Pentecostals they stayed babies they didn't move on with God Pentecost had the word for the time remember the Holy Ghost fell on on on the day of Pentecost 1906 that was the Holy Ghost that wasn't AAL that was the Holy Ghost himself amen restoring the gifts well the gifts had to re be restored so that the Holy Ghost through brother brandham could bring us that Babylon bunch of babies us when we were first born again when we first brought into come into the message we're a bunch of babies but now we got to come to maturity the call today is maturity my dad's been preaching it we've all been preaching it is a growth development it is not a sit on your development that's right fill in the blank all right so he's doing that his message is turning the hearts of the people that'll listen yeah back now what was the faith of the fathers now watch what was the faith of the of the fathers I'll read it to you in just a minute it's in my list and I'll show you what they already believe brother R didn't bring this out of the Bible that nobody ever believed it but this time water baptism was taught back then right no eternal hell was taught back then one God was taught back then amen right that's why it has to have a number two part because number one part was the first part of his ministry and it's the baby stage taking you to maturity amen but then there's got to come number two that he will reveal the Mysteries that's why I told you we I read you that scripture the Mysteries the Deep things of God it's for me and youen listen a deep mystery is simple if you know what you're doing simple but you got to have the background you can't just come in the Mage church every 15 or 20 sermons oh praise the Lord I'm sorry it's a requirement that you go to school right amen amen it's a requirement that you go to school and read your book sometimes you give test God gives them I don't yeah praise the Lord out of my hands he's a lot more gracious I think now watch number two what's going to happen number one he's going to return us back back to the doctrine of the original Pentecostal bride in the first church age the alpha Church age all right everybody with me yes all right and then because Paul brought them to that Peter brought them to that they had that in the first three ages yep Paul irus Martin they weren't trinitarians they never baptized the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost but that was that was introduced right through Creeds and dogmas Through the Dark Ages and then even Luther comes out and he's got one piece of the messages right but all the others wrong come on Wesley comes in he's got that piece plus but the rest of us wrong Pentecost comes in they got that's piece of the message the rest of us wrong you say wrong brother you say listen any Doctrine outside the true word of God is wrong there ain't no great area it's either wrong or right yeah right so it took a prophet to what to Baby handle us baby handle us to come out of the denomination and put you in the message of the hour with the doctrine that was then everybody stay with me just for a second with the doctrine that was already preached in the Bible by Paul Peter James John irenius Martin but what did it do to them it put them in a grave it might have matured him to a place to hear but they got to have something come to get us out of here to fulfill the scripture that Paul said we which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep so number two number two takes you to Revelations 10 we'll get into this later on because we're going to start into the doctrines so one according to Malachi 4 he turn the hearts of the children of the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 so don't tell me that all that's closed up don't tell me we can't get a revelation once that book's open the only person that can close is God Amen or you can close it yourself but God's going to close a book one day when that light called Gentile he going to shut that book there'll be no more called so he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals so brothers and sisters the seals had to be open to reveal listen you can't reveal you can't read this Bible with something B binding it there it's in there brother John in there they 66 books there's eternal life in here but if it shut up no good those seals were broke and when they were tore off that book come open amen and then I don't see Abraham I see me I don't see Isaiah I see me I was reading Isaiah today man read Isaiah Isaiah was a p and he was just a young man praise God you young Brothers God spoke through is he was just a young man that's right right but you know what happened to him they pulled him apart with mules and and um um oxen they pulled him apart whacked him apart whacked him up they hated him so bad that's all right if you give your life for the gospel you've not given your life for the devil right you've given your life for God Amen now watch it will be be these what divinely reveal mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so that's where we're at today but we're going to cover those doctrines a little bit later now watch in the church age book you'll recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his work in the future age all right then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation right or we will fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you will re you will see that it won't take just ordinary study amen oh come to church let the brothers talk to you a little bit get excited like Louis did Wednesday night and everybody W that was good that was good but did you listen to what he said did you take something out of that message and put it in your heart amen now watch bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordin how many people believe brother Bron was a prophet how many believe he was a messenger that's telling us how to get to this place all right he's the guide we know Jesus Christ is the guide but we had to have brother brandom to tell us where to go right now look it's not just ordinary St and thinking to make this book real it's going to take the Operation God operate on me today yes sir take out all those things that I don't need usually when you have an operation they're taking something out of you that's either ruptured bad or you don't need it right amen I've never seen an operation where they put you say well what about a heart transplant they're transplanting they're taking something out putting it in his place but they don't open you up and say I think I'm going to include a a Time Clock I think I'm gonna put a I'm gonna put a wrench right here you know no usually when they operate on you they take stuff out of you it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that means this book right here this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class people it will take one with prophetic Insight not one person he's talking about a people it will require the ability to hear from God it will require Supernatural instructions not just a student comparing verse with verse look though that is good but a mystery now we're getting ready to talk about the Mysteries but the mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear that's why I believe that teaching is that brother Brown said it places you in the body of Christ amen and placing you in the body of Christ gives you power to know who you are what you are and where you're supposed to be but mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never now what it never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay oursel open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and to know now brother Brown what are you talking about these Malachi 4 has got to do two things Rapture message 1965 when I went forth into the meetings with you praying for the sick it was fine but when I came with a message you know why he broke that off cuz he didn't want to say what he wanted to say cuz when I came with a message you rejected me cuz he's preaching this Rapture message in a trailer with about 30 people in it one of the greatest messages he ever preached if any message Goes Forth it's a true message if it's true genuine miracles of god and hangs right in that organization now watch if it's the true genuine miracles of god and hangs in that organization it's not of God CU that thing is already declared in other words that thing's already been convicted Jesus went forth and healed the sick in order to catch their eyes the people then he brought his message and what was his message I and my father are one now brother Bram said when the bride says I and my father one and these other things he said the shu's going to pull away cuz people can't stand it listen if you're not born again you're not going to be able to stand that it's going to get you right like it did the Pharisees it's going to burn right in their cross right in their soul right go brother Bri said their soul had no representation it was black only once any time then we close right here the in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel I remember Le Us in church AG the sounding of that angel when that church age is done denominated and become a church age when it's done in its Pentecostal organization when the messenger to that now watch what was each messenger what was Martin Luther a rebuke to the Catholic what' God say he's going to when he sends a message he rebukes the previous people right a plague Falls and he brings his message and condemns the people a rebuke to the lutherans Wesley what was the Pentecost a rebuke to the others where has the life gone now away from an organization no more shuck is the grain what is it a rebuke to the Pentecost SE to fulfill the scripture of this hour notice the very day when this messenger not when he start starts on not when he starts his healing campaign not when he's prayed for the sick not when he's in those denominations being nice and cordial but when he begins to declare his message in 1963 he began to declare his message right first pull healing second pull prophesying third pull opening of the word what look the Mysteries revealed no more there's no more higher order to De to reveal the the word than a prophet but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word now we know brother Brown was a Vindicated word Prophet we know that right and remember the third pole was the opening of them seals he tells you what it is the third pole is the opening of the seals right to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word listen not what Paul saw not what Peter saw no one knew who that son of man was but the son of man himself self sure they had their Doctrine they had the correct Doctrine to a point to a point there's two systems that work the word of God and denominational system I think that's pretty clear there's two there's twins in every every now look Esau and Jacob came out of the same womb righteous father righteous mother came out of the same womb one was on one side and one was on the other Esau was was the devil Jacob was type of Christ I hope that's simple enough for you to understand no other time this is the rapture message no other time could this message ever come forth till now Jesus said it was as the days of Sodom so shall be in the coming son of man the message could not be till now the world wasn't in the condition as until its in now my Heavens that was 196 4 the token message we're in 2025 60 years heading to 61 no other time could this message ever come forth till now Jesus said as was the days of Sodom so shall be in the son of man coming of the son of man the message could not be till now the world wasn't in the condition as until it is now this is the hour that Jesus could appear at any time we know what Revelations 10:7 is he's going to restore the truth as he had it which is Malachi 4 and those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the Lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his Works Hallelujah do you see it now let's read first let's go to Corinthians and then we'll close right here I read part of the scripture but I left off some of it off but that is it written I have not seen or ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man have you ever realize that we take this Bible and we read this Bible it it was written by men right we know the Holy Ghost wrote it but it had to come through Moses Isaiah Amos Ezekiel people human beings Paul arenus or or Paul I'm sorry Paul Peter James John they wrote this book by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost but they were looking for you they were looking for you they were looking at a time when what they said would be made manifest Isaiah never saw a virgin conceived true Malachi never saw John come on the scene John John the Baptist he never saw Brother randam come on the scene yet he prophesied about he probably didn't know that man was brother randam he said there'd be a Spirit come behold I send you Elijah the prophet everybody with me Paul didn't see his word made all the way manifest Peter didn't see it brother bradam didn't see it he saw the word but he didn't see you he knew they'd be a people and we just throw it off on the Wayside and whatever you can't do that man you got to get in it get in it or get out one of the two but that as it is written I have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the soul of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things there's got listen if there's not something inside of you that wants to read the Bible that wants to listen to this Prophet message of the hour you're lost you're lost just look yourself in the mirror and say you're I'm lost right cuz we only feed off the pure word of God in the end time we only feed off these things if it's not important to you you're not born again but God has revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things you may not listen there times I don't want to preach a sermon absolutely brother Bob brother L told me the other day told me other day he said If You Don't Preach me on Wednesday that's okay I mean sometimes we get tired you know what while y'all out doing other things and I'm not being this is just an office we have we did have to set I did me and me and the Lord had to set for a couple hours last night two and a half while you was off doing something else brother Bob has to get ready for what's coming up a couple Wednesdays you know or got to go preach we just don't come in here and and you know let her rip Tater chip with you know just open my book and go I think I'll read uh Mark today and no because the spirit searches all things right we need to get the leadership of the spirit the holy spirit that will tell us hey find you know what he didn't find it for me it took me a minute to find a quote that says the church is the blood by the spirit CU I was putting in the bride was the blood by the spirit it ain't in there how many times I know brother Bob has we've talked about it you you got to put in the almost the exact word that's why I want somebody to teach us how to use that folio views cuz if you don't put these that word in you can forget it you know what when you when I start just for a minute when I start typing in a word I'll put the exclamation point over here you know and and that puts the words together exactly and you start putting them in Blood by the and you still keep it's going down to you know like 20 something there's 20 something places that happen and then you put in spirit and it goes zero so you got to start all over again right brother you got to start all over again put something in there that you might think happened during that time so I took the exclamation points off and put Church blood Body Spirit found it but I was about 25 other quoes I had to go through before I found that one but God said to me look up that quote he didn't find it for me I wish sometime Sue he would he' just go here it is no I searched for 10 minutes trying to find that quote putting in all kind of things but I knew god brother B said it for the spirit searches all things yeah the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him they know each other because they're man they commune with each other because they're man you and I commune with the spirit of God because we have the spirit of God inside of us you know when I wasn't born again when I I mom would have to shame enough to come to church a couple times a year I'm sorry happened to me I didn't want to fa a with nobody I just wanted to do what my mom asked me to do and go to house why cuz there was a spirit of man inside of me there was a spirit of God I didn't want to talk I don't want to talk to your daddy you talking about a bulldog of all Bulldog his daddy was a bulldog and if he saw you he lit up and then what' he do he went come here boy you going to hear something whether you whether you want to like it or not you're going to hear what I got to say you got to read them seals we ain't going in the Rapture without you he always said you know what I do I about out the door gone why cuz I had a spirit of man in me I have a spirit of God in Me Now I don't I'm not fearful to stand up in front of anybody oh man I listen you ought to be able to converse with brother brandom if he was still here let's don't be shameful if you got the spirit of God in you then guess what it knows now watch even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God now listen don't cost to Dime now here's let's finish this which things also we speak we speak we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual remember we're a spiritual group of people we're a prophetic group of people but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judges all things yet he himself is judged of no man wow oh don't be Jud listen sisters I'm telling you you walking in Walmart with your hair and your dress and being uh holy you're judging every person that walks by you I believe that with all my heart and if you men can stand in a group of people that's drinking and cussing and smoking and and you can stand there and try to witness to them a little bit or they say man what here have a beer I don't drink why don't you do this any I don't do that no more you're judging them yes and most of the time like I was most of the time they want to go out the door they don't want to fellowship with you no more no right because they have the spirit of man but we have the spirit of God but he that is spiritual judges all things yet he himself is judged of no man cuz remember we've got to realize we are judged because God judged Christ same person but God was in human flesh called Jesus but we took he took our judgment we were judged by him he was judged of the father to be completely sinless right but he took on sin for us so that we can what we can have no spot no wrinkle no sin for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him question mark but we have the mind of Christ magicians get ready to come let me read this real quick if Revelation is beyond you now watch if you're sitting here today going I don't know what these thing you're talking about seals and you're talking about this if the revelation is beyond you look up and seek God for it problem is like brother Lise said we shut down and quit going to church that's a wor that's what devil wants you to do if Revelation is beyond you come on musicians if Revelation is beyond you look up and seek God for it that is the only way you're ever going to get it it Never Comes by human natural endowments but by spiritual enduement endued with power from on high you can even memorize the scripture and though that is wonderful that won't do it it has to be a revelation from God it says in the word that no man can say that Jesus is the Christ except by the Holy Ghost you have to receive the Holy Ghost and then and only then can the spirit give you the Revelation that Jesus is the Christ go God the anointed one no man knows the things of God save the spirit of God he's quoting the scripture I just read you and he to whom the spirit of God reveals them we need to call on God for Revelation more than anything else in the world we have accepted the Bible now watch we have accepted the great truth of it you reading that but it still is not real to most people because the Revelation by the spirit is not there now let me read these this is a list of the things now one God brother brandham always believed in one God he never believed in a trinity that's why he had to come out of the Baptist Church right water baptism he didn't believe it to what they believe he had to come out of it right no eternal hell same thing he preached Holiness conduct and dress he preached Church order he put the church back in order as Elijah did on Mount Carmel when the 400 Ministers of the day tore the altar down he put them all back put the altar right back together because the M the mystery in the end time is is that Elijah Ministry is a restoring Ministry it restored back all right it was restoration then what did he do he restored back that poor old widow woman was about to die He restored her back to life every by with me he preached Church order he brought the truth of serpent seed he brought the truth of body change for Abraham and Sarah have you ever heard that before you tell that to a denominational person they'll look at you crosseyed but it's plain once the Bible's open it's plain to see those things brother Brown brought us the difference in the body Spirit and the Soul he brought us no tribulation for the bride no white Throne judgment for the bride right he brought us to church ages put the messengers in line and the message he brought the statue of a perfect man unto adoption he brought the 70 weeks of Daniel and put them in order he brought the seal slash the Thunders you can't bring one without bringing the other The Mystery of the son of man now there's one that nobody understands in the end time except the bride she will understand this is the ministry of the son of man all right now number U well I don't have them numbered the next one is the grace given on marriage and divorce let me give you a little key on this brother brandham didn't preach marriage and divorce to tell us how a different way to get married and to divorce it was already in the Bible it was already in the Bible the right way to do it am I am I right ministers it was in the Bible already there man had just what misinterpreted theology had let it go so long till it became so eroded it wasn't Grace it was greasy Grace but brother randam brought the grace given on marriage and divorce right he brought the three PS Rapture how it was going to happen who it was going to happened to wasn't to the church only to the bride amen amen and told us exactly what the future home was going to look like and if I miss something then we'll look over it a little bit later but that's the things that we're going to bring out in the form that we of the opening of The Mysteries of God because they were Mysteries what happened was all these first few ones right here in the front they already taught it Paul when brother Ry preached Church order it come from what Paul said right he didn't bring something extra he just put it all back together he didn't say now the Bible's wrong they were wrong in that in that age there isn't there was not an eternal hell they preached it was no man preached there was man preached water baptism in the name of father son Holy Ghost they never did they never believed in one God ever till n seea then they broke him up into three made a trinity out of him and I believe they knew about serpent seed they knew what happened in the garden right but they didn't know about the body change from Abraham and Sarah Paul said I I pray that your whole body spirit and soul be preserved blameless but he didn't tell us what he he told us kind of what the body was spirit and soul what happened yeah but brother Brandon put them everyone just as clear as it could be no tribulation for the bride I'm telling you do something go to somebody that's a that's a a Baptist or a Methodist or a Pentecostal or a presbyterian and say do you believe we need to go we're going through the tribulation you know what they're going to say oh yeah we ain't none of us worth nothing we got to go through the Bible the Bible says we got to go through the tribulation my Bible doesn't say that does your B if your Bible says that you're in trouble my Bible doesn't say that my Bible say I've passed from death into life I've already took my tribulation Christ took my tribulation oh we may have little tribulations here but listen it's not going to be compared to the tribulation if you missed it that you going to have that thing out there in California a pimple to what it's going to be let's stand to her feet it's going to be Nationwide the United States is not going to be able to recover to what's going to happen to her never will recover from it if time goes on guess what they'll go out there in California right brother Joe they and time goes on they'll go out there they'll clear it off they'll build in brand new houses again they'll put their Shrubbery out they'll put this out and they put that out and some man with a cigarette will throw it out the window and they'll burn it again but when God Burns this place it's going to burn just be ready to go no white Throne judgment we've already been judged I love that you know that's my two greatest ones but we're going to go through some of these we've already been through the church ages but we're going to pick some of these out and show that it was a mystery to many people until that little Prophet comes out and preaches serpent seed lays it right out in the Bible tells us exactly what happened and then when you look at it if you got the Holy Ghost even without the Holy Ghost okay I didn't have the Holy Ghost when I was 14 years old but I knew what happened in the garden cuz brother Ram explained it so well hello but I didn't have all the parts that fit together see that's why brother R was talking about all that he said 'y you can read it you can read it but without prophetic insight you're not going to understand what you're reading let's sing a song God bless you pray for us we're going to be leaving soon as we get done I'm going to Illinois to hunt
