[4:18] 14 father we thank you for the day and
[4:22] the hour that we have we thank you for
[4:25] Jesus Christ who come and died for each
[4:27] and every one of us that we might have
[4:30] life and to have life eternal because
[4:33] Lord that's the most important thing
[4:35] that could ever be thought of in a
[4:36] human's life is eternal life people make
[4:40] great preparations and lay aside a lot
[4:43] of the things for their old age and
[4:44] their doings of life and not very much
[4:47] as laid aside for life after this one
[4:51] but we just try to place all of our
[4:53] emphasis Lord upon that that we may know
[4:57] you as life eternal
[5:00] forgive our sins lead us by thine
[5:03] understanding keep us in thy Grace that
[5:06] we may walk in the light of Your Love
[5:08] let the sick among us touch each one
[5:11] Lord and guide us all in Jesus name amen
[5:15] amen John
[5:17] 3 14 and 15 and then we'll go to John
[5:24] 14 and as Moses lifted up the serpent in
[5:27] the wilderness so even even so must the
[5:31] son of man be lifted up now why does the
[5:34] son of man have to be lifted
[5:36] up
[5:38] yep why is it the son of man has to be
[5:41] lifted
[5:46] up that whosoever believeth in him yeah
[5:51] shall not
[5:52] perish but have eternal life right let's
[5:57] go over to
[5:58] John 14
[6:05] and we'll read verse
[6:09] 12 verily verily I say unto you he that
[6:13] believeth on me the works that I do
[6:15] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[6:18] these shall he do
[6:21] because I go unto my father amen you may
[6:25] be seated the Lord at his Blessing to
[6:28] the reading of the word
[6:31] now I told you
[6:33] these this past Wednesday and this
[6:36] service tonight will be kind of a
[6:37] background for later on so I wish you
[6:40] would study and read and at least get
[6:43] familiar with the scripture there and
[6:46] things that you can on the in
[6:48] Revelations 5 because we will be
[6:51] starting uh a point on that our series
[6:54] maybe on it I don't know how it'll work
[6:56] out we just leave it at that I've got
[6:58] some questions questions and answers a
[7:01] couple that I need to cover so what
[7:03] we'll probably cover next is marriage
[7:06] and divorce because it's a question
[7:09] there about it so we will try to Maybe
[7:12] cover that the Lord willing next wednes
[7:15] day if we can but you know I want to get
[7:18] that out of the way but just keep in
[7:20] mind what I'm saying here about these
[7:23] and what we've been talking about now
[7:25] last Wednesday night we spoke about
[7:29] talking
[7:31] about a personal revelation
[7:35] right a personal
[7:39] experience with almighty God have you
[7:42] had Earth this past Sunday excuse me
[7:44] have you had a personal experience
[7:49] right if you hadn't had a personal
[7:51] experience then there is no hoax to talk
[7:54] about anything else right amen because
[7:58] everything is in vain
[8:00] right you know without a personal
[8:02] experience and remember what I was
[8:04] talking about the the most important
[8:07] personal experience it may have been odd
[8:10] to you but we'll get back to it later
[8:12] and you'll maybe understand that see
[8:15] that new
[8:17] birth is the most important thing in
[8:19] your life amen right all right yes
[8:23] because there's nothing else that's
[8:25] worth anything else you say well I had
[8:28] to have my natural birth before I could
[8:29] have a spiritual be well a lot of the
[8:32] world has done
[8:35] that they they've had a natural life
[8:38] they've had a
[8:39] beginning but they don't have a baptism
[8:41] of the Holy Ghost so a personal
[8:44] experience of the new birth to where
[8:47] that nobody can't argue with you about
[8:49] it amen nobody can't take it away right
[8:53] you say well my personal experience was
[8:56] when I first heard the message if you
[8:58] didn't have the new birth
[9:00] or don't have the new birth either way
[9:01] you want to stay
[9:03] it to hear the message is just words
[9:06] that's
[9:08] right see to hear the message doesn't
[9:10] give you eternal
[9:12] life it takes the Holy Spirit to Quicken
[9:15] the word that's what we want to get to
[9:17] tonight to make The Word Alive amen so
[9:20] no matter how much we'd hear it brother
[9:23] BR said without the baptism of the Holy
[9:25] Ghost you can hear the word every day of
[9:26] your
[9:27] life you still he'll die and go to hell
[9:30] right amen why because it's not a
[9:32] personal experience to you amen right so
[9:36] now keep that in mind now as we're
[9:38] trying to get going to get to a point of
[9:41] eternal
[9:43] life eternal
[9:45] life we'll get to it in a minute because
[9:47] the title of the message is to know him
[9:50] all right because we must have eternal
[9:56] life all everything in the Christian
[9:59] real is based upon whether or not you're
[10:02] born again
[10:03] amen as I said now you you can argue
[10:06] anything and I ain't going to argue with
[10:08] you about it I'm just telling you what I
[10:10] believe and it's the way I preach
[10:11] it this message is no good without the
[10:14] Holy Ghost to quck it amen cuz it's just
[10:17] words right that's what it's done it's
[10:20] made churches oh my it's made one of the
[10:23] greatest organizational systems of
[10:27] churches that has ever been thought of
[10:30] that's right because if you don't if you
[10:32] don't agree with the people of this
[10:33] message you're you're just out you know
[10:36] y right you don't have any hopes you
[10:39] know the Baptist would at least give the
[10:40] Methodist a little
[10:43] hope maybe the Catholic might give the
[10:45] rest of them a little hope but you
[10:48] differ with the people of this message
[10:49] and they don't give you no hope come on
[10:53] you got to come to them you know so it's
[10:55] made the worst organizational system I
[10:57] call it that way because of of the what
[11:00] it's
[11:02] doing but see eternal
[11:07] life the prophet said the greatest thing
[11:10] in your life is whether or not you're
[11:11] born
[11:13] again now who worries about who the
[11:17] president's going to
[11:19] be and all this that and the other right
[11:22] who worries about the economy and all
[11:24] what it's
[11:25] doing sure we're involved in all of
[11:27] those things but none of that will give
[11:30] you eternal life right and you'll find
[11:33] out when we get through and get back to
[11:35] the part I want to bring is because I
[11:38] started with one thought and then it
[11:39] developed into another and that's why
[11:42] I'm tying it together then into one
[11:44] message instead of preaching two
[11:46] different messages upon the thoughts
[11:48] that came to
[11:51] me now Jesus said John 14 uh John 10
[11:56] excuse me 27 and
[11:58] 28 Jesus said that he would give eternal
[12:01] life
[12:02] yeah unto his sheep that would follow
[12:06] him
[12:07] right he would give eternal
[12:10] life all right now in doing
[12:14] that he had to have eternal life
[12:19] amen before he could give eternal life
[12:22] he had to have eternal life right very
[12:25] simple statement very simple thought all
[12:27] right
[12:29] you can't give away something you don't
[12:31] have amen that's right right right right
[12:35] then he had to have eternal
[12:37] life all right didn't that ought to do
[12:39] away with lot these doctrines and things
[12:41] that Jesus wasn't Eternal until the
[12:43] River Jordan you know and all this
[12:45] didn't have eternal life and all this
[12:47] that and the other you know cuz there
[12:49] would be no
[12:50] way for him to be able to give eternal
[12:54] life that's right to anyone if he didn't
[12:57] have that eternal life to give amen
[13:00] right all right
[13:03] now so then what was he able to do now
[13:07] listen to the
[13:09] point Jesus was given
[13:12] power according to St John 1777 let's
[13:15] read
[13:16] that verse 1
[13:21] to3 these words spake Jesus and lifted
[13:24] up his eyes to heaven and said father
[13:25] the hour has come that the son of man
[13:29] that the son Also may be
[13:32] glorified excuse me gor the hour is come
[13:36] glorify thy son that thy son Also may
[13:39] glorify thee amen all right as thou Hast
[13:43] given him
[13:44] Power Over All Flesh
[13:48] y now what's the
[13:51] connection what is Power Over All
[13:54] Flesh right what would it be any good if
[13:57] you had power over every B of the flesh
[14:00] right what if you had power over
[14:02] everybody in the world what good would
[14:05] it be do we not talking about that form
[14:08] right is thou Hast given him Power Over
[14:13] All Flesh what that he should give
[14:16] eternal
[14:17] life to as many as thou Hast given him
[14:21] right and this is eternal life that they
[14:26] may Know Thee the only true God and
[14:29] Jesus Christ whom thou has sent
[14:34] now as I said what would it what would
[14:37] it profit us if we could own the
[14:42] world have
[14:45] ever it would be
[14:48] gone nothing here or those things are
[14:51] Eternal but now Jesus Christ had to have
[14:54] eternal life but then by having eternal
[14:59] life he would be able to impart that
[15:02] eternal life or give right amen
[15:06] right but the key is now that he's got
[15:08] to have it right all right before he
[15:12] could impart it he's got to have it amen
[15:15] all right so now in this day there's a
[15:18] lot of quotes that brother around Gils
[15:20] and I'll just paraphrase a couple of
[15:21] them that people say oh the church has
[15:25] power to impart eternal life
[15:31] that's all right if we have it right
[15:34] amen that's the truth yeah but the
[15:36] question is do we have it that's it amen
[15:39] now if imparting eternal life is what
[15:43] people
[15:45] thinks
[15:47] then what good is having eternal life
[15:51] right the impart it or give it you see
[15:55] amen now do you believe that a Son of
[15:57] God can do
[16:00] are in part eternal life right I believe
[16:02] we can amen yeah yes sir but there's a
[16:04] way we got to go by
[16:06] amen see it's not just because that we
[16:09] can say that the church has the
[16:13] power to forgive
[16:16] sins right see that can be taken and has
[16:19] been until it's been from every form in
[16:21] the world a thought of that point but
[16:24] what's it talking
[16:27] about how can can we impart eternal
[16:38] life you know the only way that the Lord
[16:40] Jesus Christ could impart eternal life
[16:43] was to die yep amen that's
[16:47] right he never gave eternal life to
[16:50] anybody while he was alive right now
[16:53] let's don't go to the thief on the cross
[16:55] cuz all right don't go there see and let
[16:57] your mind Wonder
[16:59] because a thief on the cross he said
[17:00] this day you'll be with me in Paradise
[17:03] he didn't give it to him while he's here
[17:05] right right amen whatever he got he got
[17:07] when he went to Paradise he didn't have
[17:08] you here right all right so
[17:13] now get the key of what I'm talking
[17:15] about the only way that Jesus could
[17:17] impart eternal life was to have eternal
[17:20] life amen amen right but then the only
[17:24] way that he could impart that eternal
[17:27] life or release that eternal
[17:30] life that it could come back upon
[17:32] someone else was the fact that he had to
[17:35] die
[17:37] amen all
[17:41] right
[17:45] now eternal
[17:47] life see I had all these quotes lined up
[17:49] to go one way and another way and so
[17:51] they're on my mind so bear with
[17:54] me but eternal life is the baptism of
[17:58] the Holy Ghost amen that's right right
[18:01] right it's not eternal life to just be a
[18:04] believer
[18:05] no amen it's not even eternal life to be
[18:08] justified or Sanctified right amen
[18:11] that's not eternal life you're just
[18:12] believing un TR amen amen you can be
[18:15] given eternal life in a later day white
[18:17] thr on judgment like the foolish virgins
[18:19] Etc but I'm talking about a personal
[18:23] experience of eternal life while you're
[18:26] here right
[18:29] now to lay that down I want you to think
[18:31] about
[18:33] it you know that Jesus
[18:38] Christ now on the internet remember we
[18:41] got the quotes to come along so we stir
[18:44] you up by your thinking
[18:45] okay you know that Jesus Christ could
[18:48] not preach the baptism of the Holy
[18:52] Ghost now you real quiet
[18:56] right because you're saying well if you
[18:58] go one way on that you got a problem if
[18:59] you go the other way we don't
[19:03] know Jesus Christ could not preach the
[19:06] baptism of the Holy
[19:10] Ghost
[19:13] why not that he didn't have it no
[19:19] right he had eternal life right right he
[19:23] had the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[19:25] correct amen he was the baptism of the
[19:28] Holy Ghost
[19:29] amen but why was it that he could not
[19:33] impart eternal life while he was
[19:37] alive why would he have to
[19:41] die now let's go to John 7 and we'll Pi
[19:46] up our Point John
[19:49] 7 and let's just read
[19:53] why John 7:37
[20:00] and in the last day that great day of
[20:02] the feast Jesus stood and cried saying
[20:05] if any man thirst Let It Come unto me
[20:07] and
[20:08] drink he that believeth on me as the
[20:10] scripture has said out of his belly
[20:13] shall flow rivers of Living Water oh man
[20:17] now watch y but this spake he of the
[20:21] Holy Spirit Come
[20:23] On which they that believe on him should
[20:27] receive yep
[20:30] for the Holy Ghost was not yet
[20:33] given because Jesus was not yet
[20:37] glorified that's
[20:38] right
[20:42] right you know that's why we say and try
[20:44] to emphasize because you'd be surprised
[20:47] how many people don't believe it that
[20:49] way but that's
[20:52] right there was nobody in the Old
[20:54] Testament had eternal life
[20:56] right they were Believing on to
[21:00] amen because the eternal life was
[21:02] dwelling in Jesus Christ
[21:06] amen and even while he was here on the
[21:10] earth he could not give that eternal
[21:13] life to anyone now come and show me
[21:16] right I mean that's all I say come and
[21:18] show
[21:19] me he couldn't do
[21:22] it you say well brother D you're
[21:24] limiting God no God limited himself so
[21:28] you are with him that's right amen you
[21:30] know there's no argument between me and
[21:32] you about it God's the one that limited
[21:35] himself he could give the baptism of the
[21:38] Holy Ghost to every person in the world
[21:39] you believe it
[21:41] amen but yet he didn't choose for it to
[21:43] be that way
[21:47] right so then he had to make a way right
[21:50] for that eternal life to come out of him
[21:57] Y and then that eternal life could come
[21:59] back in you and I amen right right all
[22:02] right that was where he would be paying
[22:04] the price all right so now the Holy
[22:07] Ghost is not yet
[22:09] given now I know this needs
[22:14] explaining
[22:16] see Jesus Christ could not preach the
[22:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[22:23] right now I didn't say he didn't talk
[22:26] about it right that's right I didn't say
[22:28] say not in the scriptures where he
[22:29] mentions it talks about it that's
[22:32] right but as an example Martin
[22:36] Luther could only preach what God
[22:39] revealed for him right that's right
[22:42] which was the just shall live by
[22:44] faith all right now I'm not saying that
[22:46] Martin Luther didn't talk about
[22:48] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[22:50] Ghost because it's in his
[22:53] wage but his basic thought was that
[22:57] justification was the baptism of the
[22:59] Holy
[23:00] Ghost John Wesley when he came along
[23:03] preaching
[23:07] sanctification he calls the baptism of
[23:09] the Holy Ghost sanctification
[23:13] right now that was all right for the
[23:18] time but Martin Luther couldn't preach
[23:22] sanctification in the true order that's
[23:24] right right
[23:27] right he couldn't preach the baptism of
[23:29] the Holy Ghost in the true order to
[23:32] follow the scriptures right why because
[23:36] he had no experience of that amen that's
[23:39] right now Jesus Christ then could not
[23:43] preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[23:46] because that Holy Ghost was inside of
[23:48] him amen that's
[23:52] right and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[23:55] would be relating to you and I right
[23:57] right he he didn't need it right he was
[24:01] he was eternal
[24:02] amen hallelujah but he was making a way
[24:05] that you and I could receive right right
[24:08] okay now you say well I I just don't
[24:12] know about that statement you just made
[24:14] well let's let the prophet make it go
[24:16] ahead
[24:18] brother Anderson pull it up let's just
[24:21] see what brother random had to say then
[24:24] at least you can't argue with him over
[24:27] what he's saying I was talking brother
[24:29] Joe brought a man over the other night I
[24:31] really enjoyed it had a good time
[24:32] sitting there talking with the brother
[24:34] but what kind of confusion he had but
[24:37] anyhow uh you know I enjoyed talking to
[24:39] him and I wouldn't arguing with him or
[24:41] or anything like that but I saw
[24:43] immediately that he was not
[24:46] familiar with the message right so
[24:49] evidently I don't know how long he's
[24:51] been in the message his reading ability
[24:54] is
[24:55] limited and so is most of the people of
[24:57] the message because they only read in
[25:00] the category or real or whatever you
[25:02] want to call it of who their Pastor is
[25:05] or or who they're talking about you know
[25:07] and amen and you just start nailing down
[25:10] that word and then after a while you'll
[25:12] see them beginning to right back off a
[25:15] little and then they'll finally come to
[25:16] their statement and they'll say I I
[25:19] don't know whether brother Brown said
[25:20] that or not you know and you know what
[25:24] we were talking about on one thing was
[25:26] that brother BR said you know that that
[25:28] the baby is is not a living Soul until
[25:32] it's dropped from the mother it's just
[25:34] wiggling muscles and jerking and things
[25:37] you'd be surprised how many people don't
[25:38] know
[25:40] that cuz he said yes said when that life
[25:43] in that blood said that was a soul in
[25:45] that blood I said no
[25:49] sir Adam was standing up a man and God
[25:54] breathed into his nostrils and he become
[25:56] a living soul brother Joe was putting in
[25:58] the points to it but my point is I told
[26:03] the man I said I'm
[26:05] glad your types and your things is fine
[26:07] for us to talk about anybody else what
[26:09] we talk about is fine you know I mean I
[26:13] don't argue with nobody if they say well
[26:15] brother this is the way I think
[26:16] something I'm not going to argue with
[26:18] you about it but I'm going to finalize
[26:21] it by saying did the prophet ever type
[26:23] it like
[26:25] that like brother Al was that time that
[26:27] brother come down there you know and he
[26:29] he typed the roading on and the house
[26:31] numbers and this that and the other
[26:33] typed everything in the world and then
[26:35] said why didn't he type his tag number
[26:37] cuz the tag number on his car was
[26:39] 666 but see he certainly didn't want to
[26:42] type that you know but right I told the
[26:46] brother I said I I don't want to argue
[26:48] nothing I said nothing I said but we got
[26:50] a
[26:52] prophit and what he
[26:56] says you know we can't AR argue
[26:59] with all right so when he makes a
[27:01] statement we believe the statement
[27:03] unless the prophet says the statement
[27:05] was wrong and here's what's right
[27:08] okay all right so now look at it so you
[27:11] might question me is to say that Jesus
[27:13] couldn't preach the baptism and the
[27:14] ghost well let's see if the prophet
[27:17] said this is 1960 1204 revelation of
[27:21] Jesus
[27:22] Christ he that believeth in me said St
[27:25] John 14:7 he that believeth in me the
[27:27] works that I do she do also do the same
[27:31] work and greater than this now we're
[27:33] going to tie these two together in a
[27:35] minute so don't get lost on
[27:37] greater and try to comp this stay with
[27:40] me until we get there all right because
[27:43] Jesus Christ could not preach the
[27:45] baptism of the Holy
[27:48] Ghost would be
[27:52] greater y right see now if he's right
[27:55] there the preaching of the baptism of
[27:57] the Holy Ghost would be
[28:00] greater now you're going to draw up on
[28:02] me on this one but the preaching of the
[28:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost would be of
[28:05] the same level as the baptism of the
[28:07] Holy Ghost if he's really preaching
[28:11] correctly
[28:12] yes
[28:14] now I know the quotes goes behind the
[28:17] greater when people say we preach the
[28:19] gospel to the world that's the Greater
[28:21] Works brother around said let's see you
[28:23] do the lesser works and then we'll talk
[28:26] about the Greater Works
[28:28] right all right he said I'll give you
[28:30] the pull pit if you want to come up here
[28:32] and do the Greater Works he said even
[28:35] come up here and do the lesser
[28:37] works you know all right but now watch I
[28:40] said don't get tied up till we get
[28:43] tired what was the problem because Jesus
[28:45] could not preach the baptism of the Holy
[28:47] Ghost would be greater he could not
[28:49] bring it to them because the Holy Ghost
[28:52] had not been given
[28:55] amen see he couldn't bring it as a
[28:58] possession to anyone cuz it had not been
[29:01] given
[29:03] amen it was there inside of him right
[29:07] but when Jesus came and S sacrificed his
[29:10] life and the Holy Ghost returned then
[29:15] they could impart eternal life to the
[29:18] people that's the greater amen now what
[29:23] is the greater now we'll get that out of
[29:24] the way the original ver says more
[29:28] y he said because nobody could do
[29:30] anything greater than what the Lord
[29:32] Jesus Christ done that's right so when
[29:35] it says the Greater Works you shall do
[29:37] it means more
[29:40] works but now he is actually
[29:43] emphasizing of Greater
[29:46] Works tying it to the baptism of the
[29:49] Holy Ghost in the people to preach this
[29:52] the scriptures
[29:55] right now you probably draw up on this
[29:58] but no one can receive the baptism of
[30:01] the Holy Ghost without first hearing the
[30:04] word amen Jo it to it amen anywhere
[30:08] anybody Brother D I sitting out in the
[30:11] woods well You' been to church I Ain
[30:14] never heard no man you went heard
[30:16] somebody you read the Bible that's
[30:18] somebody amen all right now what's the
[30:22] next
[30:23] one Jehovah Gyra 61312 now if you look
[30:27] that up the old title of that is Abraham
[30:31] U restored or something Abraham
[30:32] something that changed the title of that
[30:34] message okay cuz I was getting a rebound
[30:37] off of that today and I thought well
[30:38] where's that at and I looked it up they
[30:40] changed the title to Jehovah JRA all
[30:43] right so look what he
[30:48] says Jesus could
[30:50] not well let's go back up let's back up
[30:53] above
[30:54] there where's the gods of baam where is
[30:57] your critics say the holy spirit is not
[30:59] right come forth do the same thing you
[31:03] say well Jesus said a greater than this
[31:07] amen you come do the works he done first
[31:10] then we'll talk about the greater and
[31:12] I'll tell you what it
[31:14] is that's going to tell you what the
[31:16] Greater Works is Jesus could not preach
[31:19] the baptism of the Holy Ghost it hadn't
[31:22] come yet that's the Greater Works we're
[31:25] doing
[31:29] but do the same Works he did he said you
[31:33] would amen all right
[31:36] now so he says now we're preaching the
[31:39] baptism of the Holy
[31:41] Ghost and that's the Greater
[31:44] Works I all I you go run Greater Works
[31:47] in the computer you'll find that all
[31:49] kind of quotes like people say we preach
[31:52] the gospel that's the Greater Works
[31:54] that's not what he's talking about there
[31:55] right right
[31:59] because if you have the baptism of the
[32:01] Holy
[32:03] Ghost you can preach the baptism of the
[32:05] Holy right amen if not you're saying
[32:08] what somebody else say right
[32:11] amen but if you have it you can preach
[32:14] it amen
[32:16] and now come
[32:20] on the same Works he did y you'll do now
[32:26] there see you'll frown up I don't see
[32:28] well that's where your blinded eyes amen
[32:31] that's right open up we've seen a lot of
[32:33] things around here yes sir amen that God
[32:36] has done Among Us healings and signs and
[32:38] wonders the word spoken all kind of
[32:41] things oh yes I want to see a whole lot
[32:43] more yes sir that's right but let's
[32:45] don't deny what he's done amen amen we
[32:48] deny what he's done then he'll he don't
[32:50] have to do anything else for us all
[32:53] right but now what
[32:58] getting in the spirit 1961
[33:04] 428 and you say preaching the gospel is
[33:06] Greater
[33:09] Works what I said you go through there
[33:11] and read them you'll find a lot of these
[33:13] all right then you come here and do the
[33:16] lesser
[33:19] works and watch you here's the platform
[33:22] help yourself come up here and go down
[33:25] through this prayer line and let the
[33:26] Holy Spirit move out and to the audience
[33:28] there over you let me see you do them
[33:31] works and then go preach the gospel then
[33:34] you do do of Greater
[33:37] Works what if you get the baptism of the
[33:39] Holy Ghost first yep right Jesus could
[33:43] not preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[33:45] because it did not yet come
[33:47] y That's a Greater Works it certainly is
[33:51] the church is to preach the baptism of
[33:53] the Holy Spirit Jesus said it was coming
[33:56] but the church had it and saying we got
[33:59] it and it's for you see so that was a
[34:03] greater that is true
[34:06] right y see now
[34:09] Jesus had within him don't misunderstand
[34:12] me he was the baptism of the Holy
[34:16] Ghost but it was a fact that he was
[34:18] leaving something for the church to
[34:22] do and there it was not in manifestation
[34:28] right while he was alive and here was
[34:31] inside of him
[34:34] man see then there's no way you could
[34:37] say we could do the Greater Works right
[34:39] unless that same Holy Spirit can come
[34:41] into us
[34:44] right and then by that Holy Spirit
[34:47] coming into
[34:49] us then we can preach the gospel
[34:53] amen that's right the good news
[34:56] mhm because we're talking about what's
[34:58] inside of
[35:02] us now what mama said Daddy said or
[35:06] somebody else said brother Brown said or
[35:08] even Jesus
[35:13] said it's what's personal to
[35:17] youen by the new
[35:19] birth look at the next one now I wish
[35:22] you'd listen to this whole
[35:24] message
[35:26] 19692 that day on Calvary we start at
[35:28] paragraph
[35:29] [Music]
[35:31] 129 I wish you'd listen to this whole
[35:33] message
[35:34] listen now notice the Greater Works was
[35:38] to have the power in the
[35:41] church look not only to heal the Sick by
[35:47] prayer cast out SE Devils by prayer see
[35:51] not only that
[35:53] right that's wonderful that's part of it
[35:56] okay amen but to impart eternal life to
[36:04] Believers the Holy Ghost was coming and
[36:07] given into the hands of the church to
[36:10] impart life oh that's what Calvary
[36:14] meant now you read the rest of them in
[36:16] between there but jump on down to the
[36:19] next next
[36:21] paragraph let's see I wanted let's just
[36:23] start on 130 pull it back to 130 let's
[36:26] just read it how how much greater is it
[36:28] to say to this sick woman laying here
[36:31] now listen to this man explaining the
[36:34] Greater
[36:35] Works he's just said casting out Devils
[36:38] Healing The Sick is fine but the Greater
[36:41] Works is to preach the gospel right
[36:43] right right all right now watch the
[36:46] reason he said how much greater is it to
[36:48] say to this sick woman laying here I can
[36:51] pray a prayer of faith and she'll be
[36:53] healed that's a great
[36:55] thing that's what he was doing
[36:58] then now Jesus would do but said greater
[37:02] than this shall you do I'm going to give
[37:05] you power not only to raise him up for a
[37:08] while yeah come
[37:10] on but to give him eternal life right
[37:13] thank you Lord which will be Eternal
[37:15] forever
[37:17] amen poor blind wretched people how do
[37:20] you miss that don't you see what the
[37:21] greater thing is that's the greatest
[37:24] thing that could ever happen was to to
[37:27] impart eternal life to people right
[37:31] amen amen but everybody when you mention
[37:35] Greater Works they'll immediately quote
[37:38] get up here and do what the Lesser works
[37:40] well God's done the Lesser works here
[37:43] you need testimonies out there of the
[37:45] sick healed the dead raised what do you
[37:47] need right right we've seen it here we
[37:50] can testify of it we can verify here
[37:52] amen
[37:55] right we've seen God do
[37:57] great
[38:00] things but we've also seen him do the
[38:03] greater things amen
[38:05] right because the reason most of you are
[38:08] here tonight was
[38:10] because that God reached down and
[38:13] touched you by what
[38:15] somebody said that's right that's right
[38:18] amen right yes
[38:20] sir what somebody preached that's right
[38:23] right sir okay get it in the right order
[38:27] look what he said what is eternal
[38:31] life the life that he lived the life
[38:33] that was in him impart that to
[38:37] others can a man do that a Son of God
[38:40] can right Jesus said whosoever sends you
[38:44] remit to them they are remitted
[38:46] whosoever sends you reain to them they
[38:48] reain now here's where the Catholic
[38:50] church and many others made their big
[38:52] mistake they go out and say I forgive
[38:54] your sins y that wasn't is that's right
[38:58] right that wasn't it that's that's not
[39:00] it to say I forgive it
[39:02] right you said well we've been given
[39:05] power to forgive sins right come by the
[39:08] word come
[39:10] on how did they get sins forgiven in the
[39:13] Bible
[39:16] MH Peter answered that question on the
[39:18] day of Pentecost they said how can we do
[39:22] what can we do to be saved how can we
[39:26] get this that you you all
[39:29] got
[39:31] yeah
[39:34] saved how can we get this that you all
[39:37] got he laid down the prescription he
[39:39] told them what to do he said repent
[39:43] every one of
[39:44] you towards God and be baptized in the
[39:47] name of Jesus Christ what far the
[39:50] remission of sins dares the
[39:53] Greater
[39:56] Works is taking the gospel
[40:00] Y and preaching it and people believing
[40:04] it and receiving it whether it be listen
[40:08] whether it be healing or signs or
[40:11] wonders
[40:13] right the Bible says faith cometh by
[40:16] what hearing hearing and hearing by the
[40:19] word of
[40:20] God to whether it be healings or signs
[40:23] or W or whether it be
[40:25] salvation right
[40:29] but you see that's all people wanted in
[40:31] the days that the prophet was on the
[40:33] Earth was the healing signs and wonders
[40:36] that's all you hear people talk
[40:40] about you don't hear
[40:43] him say that one older call and 30,000
[40:49] converts boy if Billy graem or Roberts
[40:52] and them had 30,000 in one meeting well
[40:54] it'd be great wouldn't it it held on
[40:58] yeah right what are you following
[41:03] me the Greater Works
[41:08] amen heal the bodies then we get sick
[41:13] again deliver the people they'll be in
[41:16] bondage
[41:19] again but to be able to preach the
[41:22] gospel
[41:25] amen now
[41:29] the prophet of God said the seed comes
[41:31] through the what body the body amen how
[41:36] does the natural seed get into a woman
[41:39] what from the male that was in his body
[41:43] right all right now how does the bride
[41:47] receive she receives his word y he makes
[41:51] it
[41:53] alive that's why Faith cometh back here
[41:55] amen
[41:57] like I've always said you know preachers
[42:00] is kind of grin when I say it but the
[42:02] Bible still says it it doesn't say faith
[42:05] comes by preaching
[42:07] right now I know the rest of the
[42:09] scripture how can they preach unless
[42:10] they be sent and all that I know all
[42:12] about it but the Bible says faith comes
[42:14] by
[42:16] hearing somebody's got to preach it yes
[42:18] that's what I'm talking
[42:20] about but faith comes by hearing
[42:24] right show me one time in the Bible
[42:27] anybody ever receive the baptism of the
[42:28] Holy Ghost without hearing a sermon
[42:30] first
[42:31] right that's
[42:35] right somebody had to bring the message
[42:38] right
[42:41] amen see because Jesus says my words are
[42:45] life that's right yeah now we're getting
[42:48] back to TI the two points
[42:51] together it's not to know the
[42:55] word that's what he was saying there in
[42:57] the scriptures but to know him is
[43:00] eternal life
[43:02] amen all right we got the quotes Ling
[43:04] here it's not to know the
[43:06] word but to know the author of the word
[43:10] that's right amen
[43:12] yes to how the word Made Alive in you
[43:17] brings eternal life amen not how much
[43:20] you read
[43:21] [Applause]
[43:24] it is how much revealed amen
[43:30] all right do you say well now brother
[43:32] Dale I've seen people that can get up
[43:34] and and preach and people will just weep
[43:36] their way to the altar amen I believe in
[43:38] that because there's gifts I believe in
[43:40] it I'm wonderfully I believe in it
[43:47] right well well you preach and they
[43:49] don't come to the
[43:55] altar I talk the Propet taught us we
[43:57] could receive the Holy Ghost sitting in
[43:59] your
[44:00] seat but now listen whether it be
[44:03] because a
[44:05] gift brings you into a uh condition to
[44:10] be able to
[44:11] believe that a lot of people have that
[44:13] gift and I don't have it I'm honest I
[44:15] just don't don't claim to be I just
[44:17] claim to be a preacher of the Gospel
[44:21] right and I guess it's kind of odd
[44:24] because of my experience that I was 2
[44:26] years in in the baptism of the Holy
[44:28] Ghost and and then a lot of you people
[44:30] are your experiences has been over years
[44:33] that you sat here and
[44:35] listened but if it comes out to the end
[44:37] of it what's the difference in years of
[44:40] listening or one sermon if it reaches
[44:42] the same ultimate
[44:44] end right see I don't have the gift of
[44:47] being able to just contact people and
[44:50] and and children I've seen people that
[44:52] be able to just deal with children and
[44:54] just just get right down with them and
[44:56] just so wonderful and and I'm glad of
[44:58] that amen that's a gift yes
[45:01] sir but now what am I going to
[45:04] do well I guess you just quit
[45:07] preaching
[45:11] well I found out a long time ago what
[45:13] the new birth
[45:17] was I found out that the new birth was
[45:19] the revealed word amen the word Made
[45:23] Alive you agree with that amen that's
[45:26] right the new birth is when the word
[45:28] that the disciples took and they held
[45:30] that
[45:31] word they cherished it the scripture say
[45:35] and when the Holy Ghost fell on the day
[45:36] of
[45:38] Pentecost then they had eternal
[45:42] life y but what if they didn't hold on
[45:44] to the
[45:46] word
[45:48] right see we want everything on an
[45:50] instantaneous quick
[45:54] thing brother Ram said even like he
[45:59] he said a miracle doesn't bring as much
[46:03] Faith to
[46:05] you as it is if you have to hold on a
[46:08] while that's right and finally receive
[46:11] it y now you need those
[46:16] quotes see we want an instant healing
[46:19] but that doesn't bring Faith to us
[46:22] that's just a Deliverance all at once
[46:24] right but they have to hold on and keep
[46:26] confessing it when everybody is saying
[46:28] different from you and you know every
[46:30] doctors declared wrong you're wrong and
[46:32] all and you just keep saying it y
[46:35] amen that's
[46:37] right that brings
[46:41] Faith but see not to know the letter of
[46:44] the
[46:46] word the prophet
[46:48] said but to know him amen who is the
[46:54] word that's right
[46:58] when he that is the word is Made Alive
[47:00] in you there is a son and daughter of
[47:03] God that's
[47:05] right there's somebody that's got
[47:07] something that will hold
[47:09] them like I've always tried to
[47:11] illustrate it you know people come into
[47:13] the message and they're they're find out
[47:15] organized religion is wrong and boy
[47:17] they're on fire they're just going but I
[47:19] while they
[47:20] just first thing you know right back in
[47:23] same old churches in y or even worse
[47:27] yeah but you see somebody come
[47:30] along and they just fighting like
[47:32] everything and
[47:34] struggling but all that time that word
[47:36] is being planted within them and after a
[47:39] while they just come out of there and
[47:40] they
[47:42] say where can we go right thou H has the
[47:46] words of eternal life
[47:48] amen it's all settled then right amen
[47:51] now which way do you
[47:53] want I want the lasting experience I
[47:56] don't be the right way saying it but
[47:58] best I can come up with I want something
[48:01] that'll hold me
[48:03] amen and see that's when I was looking
[48:05] at that scripture there where it says to
[48:07] know him is life
[48:10] amen to know
[48:13] him not to know about
[48:16] him not to be able to tell you all about
[48:20] him right but to have an experience
[48:23] within your heart of the living Christ
[48:26] amen amen then what you have in your
[48:30] head by knowledge can be made
[48:33] alive I've always said I would to God
[48:36] that I had revealed in my heart what is
[48:38] in my head sir amen
[48:42] right meaning in my head is a good
[48:45] computer that can remember a lot of
[48:46] things the prophet said but then one day
[48:49] it just clicks you know all at once you
[48:51] say well that's what it
[48:54] was so now do you understand time
[48:57] together that to know him is
[48:59] life that's right the only way you can
[49:01] have the new
[49:03] birth is for somebody to bring to you
[49:07] the word amen
[49:10] right that's right whether it be the
[49:12] Bible whether it be a tape you're
[49:14] listening to whether it be whatever mama
[49:17] said it or daddy said it or so and so
[49:18] said it or what somebody helped you
[49:21] somebody brought it to you
[49:23] amen that's right it wasn't something
[49:25] you come up with all at once on your own
[49:27] that's right
[49:29] sir right
[49:32] right but it's when something down
[49:34] inside of
[49:39] you can agree with what's being
[49:44] said now is that not what the prophet
[49:46] called the evidence of the Holy Spirit
[49:51] right he said it's
[49:53] love he said it's fruits of the spirit
[49:57] right he didn't argue about those things
[49:59] cuz that's in the
[50:01] Bible but in his finality of what was he
[50:04] saying about the baptism of the Holy
[50:06] Ghost what did he say the evidence
[50:08] whether or not the spirit in you agrees
[50:10] with the word amen agrees means keeps on
[50:14] going right amen not
[50:18] agreed but
[50:20] agrees
[50:22] y see then you think it's not dwelling
[50:25] within the the people's heart or
[50:27] whatever and you say well we need to get
[50:29] that's what a man told me one time he
[50:30] said I had to take my wife to a
[50:32] Pentecostal Church to get her free in
[50:35] the spirit where she could receive the
[50:38] Holy
[50:41] Ghost I'm not know what I'm aggravating
[50:43] and hateful and arrogant but I just told
[50:45] him I said brother you messed
[50:50] up oh he didn't like that even later
[50:54] denied it even said it but he came back
[50:56] before he died and told me he did say
[51:01] it but you
[51:03] see I said you mean to tell me now that
[51:06] a Pentecostal now we're talking about a
[51:08] denominational Pentecostal preacher
[51:11] Pentecostal preacher would know more
[51:12] about the baptism of the Holy Ghost than
[51:14] a born again believer in this
[51:18] message a preacher in this message
[51:20] preaching the
[51:22] gospel see what he was saying was and
[51:24] that's what he didn't like the
[51:27] Pentecostal preacher got her all
[51:29] excited got her emotionally worked up
[51:33] the word that she could believe that
[51:34] something did take
[51:37] place and brother R said that some
[51:39] people shouted and receive it some
[51:41] people shouted and didn't receive
[51:44] right but still
[51:46] irregardless you say but but my children
[51:50] I want to take them to a church that's
[51:51] got a an emotional atmosphere where they
[51:54] can be in the presence of God
[51:59] thank
[51:59] you I didn't know you really didn't
[52:01] think that you know I thought you
[52:03] thought the presence of God was
[52:06] here but see you want to go somewhere to
[52:08] some emotional
[52:11] situation instead of just sitting down
[52:14] and taking that
[52:15] word and
[52:19] believeing and let the Holy Spirit Come
[52:21] to it and make it alive right but
[52:24] brother R said if you if you are truly
[52:27] genuine and you're
[52:29] repentant and you get baptized in the
[52:31] name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said
[52:33] God is HonorBound to give you the
[52:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost you need that
[52:40] quote see because you've done what he
[52:42] said right amen you're not depending
[52:46] upon shoutings and different things and
[52:48] brother D believes in all of those
[52:49] things and manifestations of God yes
[52:54] sir we are kind of like brother re said
[52:56] about it the other day he said well
[52:58] brother R talking about you know don't
[53:00] jump too high that you can't walk
[53:01] straight and you come down he said we
[53:03] just don't jump too much yeah I guess
[53:06] it's that's about the truth we don't
[53:08] jump very
[53:12] much but I do know you can blow it all
[53:14] out to whistle and and the train won't
[53:19] move well I'd rather just stick it all
[53:22] in the engine and let the Train move a
[53:25] little bit and then I can blow him a
[53:27] whistle while it's coasting downhill you
[53:30] know
[53:31] right you understand what I'm trying to
[53:33] say what is the Greater
[53:36] Works it's not the denominational way of
[53:39] preaching that's not it we're going
[53:41] cover that I got these quotes all you
[53:43] want of that it's not those
[53:48] things but it's by the genuine baptism
[53:51] of the Holy Ghost in your heart soul of
[53:54] your being to tell other people how you
[53:57] got saved
[54:02] amen I thought brother Ram told those
[54:04] Brothers they said what should we do now
[54:06] brother brand should we do this he said
[54:08] just go tell them how the candle got lit
[54:10] that's it right right just tell them how
[54:15] the candle got lit amen just tell them
[54:18] what happened to you y you see that's
[54:21] what makes it a big
[54:24] mockery because what do the people of
[54:26] this men
[54:29] say you believe right around the
[54:31] prophet you don't believe right around
[54:33] the prophet you
[54:35] lost now about am I right
[54:38] yeah well is that how the candle got
[54:42] lit maybe that's why lit their candle
[54:45] you
[54:50] right but you know
[54:54] what and I hope to God you take this
[54:56] correctly I believe in all manifestation
[54:59] of the Holy Spirit shouting speaking in
[55:01] tongues all things emotionalism in all
[55:04] form as long as it's in the Holy Spirit
[55:07] right right I
[55:12] do but
[55:15] listen you can do every B of that and
[55:17] still be lost that's
[55:20] right David shouted before the Ark of
[55:23] the Covenant that's right
[55:28] but yet he didn't have the baptism of
[55:29] the Holy Ghost that's
[55:30] right think about that he didn't have
[55:32] the new
[55:35] birth see to know him as
[55:39] life y That's The Secret the secret of
[55:43] the whole thing is first to know him
[55:45] amen amen then go out and tell people
[55:47] how you got saved right right well I got
[55:51] saved because the seals was preached
[55:54] to bless him
[55:57] you know that that was part of brother
[55:59] brandom's
[56:00] experience
[56:02] sure that's
[56:06] right that was the part of brother
[56:08] Brown's
[56:10] experience but that's not my experience
[56:16] right because he was the one to preach
[56:18] it just as Jesus couldn't preach the
[56:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost cuz it was
[56:23] inside of him right he had to wait and
[56:25] let it come inside of the people where
[56:27] they could preach
[56:29] it brother ROM actually makes this
[56:32] statement he said John preached
[56:33] justification and Jesus preached
[56:35] sanctification amen you like
[56:38] them he said but the disciples preach
[56:40] the baptism of the Holy
[56:48] Ghost to know him is life not to know
[56:51] the letter of the
[56:55] word but for that
[56:58] word that you hear yeah to just come
[57:04] alive in you
[57:07] amen see then you don't have to
[57:11] worry you mean they could deprogram you
[57:14] with a
[57:16] trinity you know I me they take you in
[57:20] deprogram you yeah
[57:27] you know that's what they were trying to
[57:28] do in the fox's book of martyr right was
[57:31] deprogram those people right right and
[57:34] they gave their
[57:37] lives for what they believe
[57:41] right how close as I tried to express to
[57:44] you how close was it on the first I see
[57:47] in
[57:48] counsil that's right it was not an
[57:51] argument over one God or three
[57:54] Gods it was an argument over whether
[57:56] Jesus was God or another
[57:59] substance how
[58:01] close was it right it is so close if you
[58:05] go back and read it you'll find that
[58:07] even I think it's easis or what his name
[58:10] was was the one that was trying to teach
[58:12] the the the fact that Jesus wasn't the
[58:15] substant and a lot of scriptures he was
[58:17] quoting was greater scriptures than the
[58:19] other man was trying to
[58:23] bring but what about it
[58:27] do you next do you actually know him
[58:30] amen that's
[58:33] right or this just just an argument that
[58:36] we
[58:44] have but do you have eternal
[58:51] life if you have eternal life there's
[58:53] only one way to have it and that's the
[58:55] first he the word right amen and the
[58:59] Holy Spirit can Quicken that word amen
[59:02] right making that Word Alive cuz that's
[59:04] what happened in the book of Acts
[59:07] right they had heard the word they were
[59:10] sitting in the upper room you remember
[59:12] the prophet Illustrated I think we got
[59:15] it some of them said let's get up and
[59:18] go I think we got it one of them was
[59:21] wise enough to say wait a minute
[59:24] now you know yourself you're still
[59:26] scared and I am
[59:28] too that's plain language what they were
[59:33] saying but you know when that Holy Ghost
[59:35] came W afraid of
[59:40] nobody see a
[59:42] Christian don't argue
[59:47] right CU there's no need of arguing amen
[59:51] arguments has never settled any problem
[59:56] right but take the word and just place
[59:59] it into your heart that's it just keep
[1:00:02] reading it reading it you that are
[1:00:04] wondering about the baptism of the Holy
[1:00:06] Ghost whether you have it or
[1:00:09] not take it and believe yep right
[1:00:13] right and just hold right on to that
[1:00:16] word that's right that's
[1:00:19] right I've told you the way I
[1:00:22] done you know God has been gracious to
[1:00:25] his old boy
[1:00:26] I told you what I done and I laid the
[1:00:28] Bible down laid the book with the side
[1:00:29] of it and I told God praying God this
[1:00:32] man here says there'll be false prophets
[1:00:35] what if he's one of
[1:00:40] them you know he never spent 2 hours and
[1:00:43] a half showing me all of the healings
[1:00:45] and the signs and the Wonders that's
[1:00:48] right right all he said was one thing
[1:00:52] and I asked him a second time later and
[1:00:53] he said the same thing he said what ises
[1:00:55] the word
[1:00:57] say
[1:01:00] Amen how could I argue when he was
[1:01:02] saying what does the word say that's
[1:01:05] right and I'd go back and read what the
[1:01:07] prophet had to say about what the Bible
[1:01:09] was saying and I could see it unfold so
[1:01:14] beautiful and I didn't have the baptism
[1:01:16] of the Holy Ghost when I was doing that
[1:01:22] Bless but you see I held on and I had
[1:01:24] everybody praying for me where I
[1:01:26] went I H
[1:01:30] on until one day brother Mo made a right
[1:01:33] statement he said brother Dale I don't
[1:01:35] know what you're hunting for I said I
[1:01:36] don't either cuz you know I'm not after
[1:01:38] signs and
[1:01:42] wonders he said the Holy Ghost is the
[1:01:44] alive
[1:01:48] word to receive the word is to receive
[1:01:52] life now I'm not talking about reading
[1:01:55] the word I didn't say that right I said
[1:01:58] to receive the
[1:02:00] word is life
[1:02:03] amen not to just read letters off a page
[1:02:07] right but to receive the god of the
[1:02:09] letter amen that's
[1:02:14] right see then the Greater Works is
[1:02:16] being done
[1:02:19] yes the true five-fold Ministry is
[1:02:21] preaching the gospel amen you notice the
[1:02:24] words I use they're preaching the Gospel
[1:02:27] of Jesus Christ that the prophet of God
[1:02:29] handed down to us and depending totally
[1:02:32] upon the prophet's message for the
[1:02:34] answer to all questions that's right
[1:02:37] amen not their own thoughts and their
[1:02:39] own ideas or own Concepts or what
[1:02:42] everybody's taught them or
[1:02:49] something that's right is it just to
[1:02:53] know him as life amen
[1:02:58] not to know his
[1:03:01] word that's the way you find life is to
[1:03:04] know him not know his book but to know
[1:03:08] him amen not to know your church but to
[1:03:12] know
[1:03:13] him not to thirst to satisfy the
[1:03:18] pastor but to satisfy the Lord
[1:03:24] right that's right see we're children of
[1:03:27] God right amen God wants his children to
[1:03:29] be strong and sturdy not arrogant and
[1:03:33] hateful but strong and sturdy in his
[1:03:35] word
[1:03:37] amen that ever a little wind of Doctrine
[1:03:40] won't throw you every which you way you
[1:03:42] wonder what this is and what that is
[1:03:44] well that brother so and so said that
[1:03:46] well so
[1:03:49] what brother told me there the other
[1:03:51] night said this man said that brother
[1:03:53] Brown told him that
[1:03:56] the beast in the garden was a big black
[1:03:59] man I said what was he
[1:04:04] mean
[1:04:06] yeah well he said brother Brown told
[1:04:09] him where did Brother Brown say
[1:04:14] that the brother said they think the
[1:04:16] curse that was put on
[1:04:18] Cain was that he was made
[1:04:20] black he said if that be so it ended at
[1:04:25] the flood
[1:04:27] because you only had the descendant of
[1:04:28] Noah that would eradicated the black man
[1:04:31] if that's what you're talking
[1:04:33] about what's the
[1:04:40] reason I'm not saying brother Brown
[1:04:42] didn't say that he was a great big huge
[1:04:44] dark colored
[1:04:45] man
[1:04:47] sure because being in an environment
[1:04:49] they was in they probably be
[1:04:52] dark but to show you how people get all
[1:04:55] tied up we got talking about
[1:04:57] DNA and he said well there's only three
[1:04:59] types of blood and that's a b and O you
[1:05:02] know o mix with
[1:05:04] anything he said well Eve was a Adam was
[1:05:07] a b was Eve and the Beast was
[1:05:11] O I
[1:05:17] said I said according to my
[1:05:20] understanding Eve was in
[1:05:23] Adam come on M so that meant E's blood
[1:05:27] type was a if Adams was a
[1:05:33] right you see it's always something to
[1:05:36] try to talize the
[1:05:44] ears you know about years ago I've heard
[1:05:47] preachers in this message preach that
[1:05:50] look at the black man if you want to
[1:05:51] find the big ball players
[1:05:55] the big guys coming out of black people
[1:05:58] well you know I'm kind of glad now they
[1:06:00] getting all these guys from overseas and
[1:06:03] I never didn't know how that a Chinese
[1:06:05] could be 7
[1:06:10] foot6 I thought it was little bitty
[1:06:13] people that's
[1:06:16] right they're not coming out of Africa
[1:06:18] now the big ones are not right they're
[1:06:21] coming out of some of these countries
[1:06:23] that they're not supposed to even be
[1:06:24] that way it looks God supposed to be Liv
[1:06:26] B
[1:06:27] people I'm not making a joke right I'm
[1:06:31] just talking about how that we take our
[1:06:33] mind and we try to comprehend the word
[1:06:36] right yep that's right let the Holy
[1:06:40] Spirit tell you what the word says
[1:06:43] amen then you'll find him saying it says
[1:06:46] what it
[1:06:48] said Jesus said the church would be able
[1:06:54] to do Greater Works yeah
[1:06:59] righten CU you see all of his
[1:07:02] preaching he had to
[1:07:05] die Amen to bring the Holy Spirit upon
[1:07:09] the people y
[1:07:12] right but we can preach the gospel and
[1:07:15] the Holy Spirit can follow the word and
[1:07:17] give birth to
[1:07:19] Children amen and lead us into
[1:07:22] understanding
[1:07:26] the Greater
[1:07:28] Works is the preaching of the Gospel
[1:07:31] amen right because with that then
[1:07:34] there'll automatically be signs and
[1:07:37] wonders amen always has been and always
[1:07:41] will be right
[1:07:42] amen these signs shall follow them that
[1:07:45] believe right
[1:07:49] Amen brother Harris used to say
[1:07:52] Believers don't follow signs and signs
[1:07:54] follow believers that's a good one
[1:07:57] that's
[1:07:59] right but do you see what I'm talking
[1:08:03] about don't misc confuse me of what I'm
[1:08:06] saying
[1:08:08] now I'm not talking about just
[1:08:14] preaching I'm talking about what it says
[1:08:16] about the foolishness of preacher
[1:08:20] right right now what's the foolishness
[1:08:23] of preaching I bunch of foolish
[1:08:25] preachers if that didn't say that that
[1:08:26] me what the Bible that's right
[1:08:33] no you tell
[1:08:36] me how come you believe this message
[1:08:39] come on all
[1:08:41] right you explain to me why you believe
[1:08:44] this message
[1:08:49] amen will we follow Vindicated Prophet
[1:08:52] with it well if that's all you can say
[1:08:53] then that's all you got right
[1:08:59] but you
[1:09:02] see I like to tell people about what I
[1:09:05] know
[1:09:08] Amen to know him is life
[1:09:14] amen let me tell you what's in my
[1:09:17] heart that's
[1:09:21] right you see that's why I don't have to
[1:09:23] worry about what anybody else says
[1:09:26] that's
[1:09:27] right I just wait on
[1:09:30] him amen that's a way to talk to anybody
[1:09:33] that's right can't do it no way you
[1:09:36] talking to somebody just wait don't be
[1:09:39] yuy yuy yuy let them talk that's
[1:09:43] it nine times out of 10 they wind up
[1:09:46] confus their own self so much they don't
[1:09:47] know what's going on right let talk
[1:09:52] right then after a while you say well I
[1:09:54] want to go now you
[1:09:56] said and now you
[1:09:58] saying just time talk that's
[1:10:02] right and just wait on the one that's
[1:10:04] inside you amen you know what I wait on
[1:10:08] I say a lot of times I'll be talking to
[1:10:09] somebody and I said I remember brother
[1:10:12] Brown explained that one
[1:10:14] day how did he say
[1:10:18] it and you know what that's the answer I
[1:10:20] give is how he
[1:10:22] said right that's a good answer
[1:10:25] right
[1:10:28] yep but have you had a personal
[1:10:32] experience right
[1:10:35] man of eternal
[1:10:39] life does the person of Christ lives
[1:10:42] inside of
[1:10:45] you if he does he got there because
[1:10:47] somebody preached to you
[1:10:49] amen you heard the word somewhere
[1:10:55] and God made it
[1:11:00] alive now they ended up then that's why
[1:11:02] the Bible says what ye
[1:11:07] are what written
[1:11:12] Epistles known and read of all mankind
[1:11:16] oh my on
[1:11:19] Amen now brother Ram explained that
[1:11:22] right y he said you're not something
[1:11:25] added to the word he said that's not
[1:11:28] what it's saying that's
[1:11:30] right he said really it's saying you are
[1:11:34] the
[1:11:35] Epistles that are
[1:11:40] written and then people can look at it
[1:11:42] and see what you
[1:11:47] believe come on church that's why I stay
[1:11:50] and spent so much time there Sunday
[1:11:52] morning I wish everybody hope everybody
[1:11:54] in this church listen to that t amen cuz
[1:11:57] it was a hard Endeavor in my life to try
[1:11:59] to preach it see you go out sisters and
[1:12:02] you cut the ends of your hire and you
[1:12:03] put a little makeup on you're a
[1:12:05] hypocrite to the world and ain't going
[1:12:06] to listen to what you say that's
[1:12:10] right because your life is speaking so
[1:12:12] loud you can't hear your words that's
[1:12:15] that's
[1:12:16] right but the true sweetness of the Holy
[1:12:19] Spirit living in you and in you walking
[1:12:22] in the life you live before others amen
[1:12:25] that can win people to the
[1:12:29] word you remember the the man that
[1:12:31] brother R called it lizard ey Hunter the
[1:12:33] guy that
[1:12:35] bur he had talked to him about the Lord
[1:12:38] cuz later he said but lead me to that
[1:12:40] God you've talked about right so surely
[1:12:42] brother random had talked with him but
[1:12:44] none of that led him surely brother
[1:12:46] randam had even maybe told him Visions
[1:12:48] he had and things that were happening
[1:12:50] and and where the animals were at and
[1:12:52] whatever this was or that was none of
[1:12:54] that one birth
[1:12:57] but when he saw that mother deer put her
[1:12:59] life on the line for her little
[1:13:03] one that led him to Jesus Christ that's
[1:13:08] right she was a
[1:13:14] book brother randam
[1:13:16] says amen the book is
[1:13:22] sealed and you're sealed with the book
[1:13:24] right
[1:13:31] where did that book come from it's all
[1:13:32] I'm going to say and then stop where did
[1:13:35] that book come from in Revelations
[1:13:45] 5 we thank God for a prophet we even
[1:13:48] know where the lamb came from right
[1:13:56] you're going to find out one of these
[1:13:57] days brother brother Dale in 1982 in 79
[1:14:01] and 82 tried his best to preach
[1:14:02] something to
[1:14:04] you and never chosen to try about go
[1:14:07] back over and I want this time not to
[1:14:08] take a seal and go through it
[1:14:12] no but I still believe it that's
[1:14:16] right you're the book in in the hand of
[1:14:19] the one sitting on amen that's
[1:14:22] it yes
[1:14:27] and you're sealed with the book that's
[1:14:29] right
[1:14:30] right you're what's sealed
[1:14:40] up you're what sealed
[1:14:43] up what is the opening of the seal oh
[1:14:45] that an't a Christ that ain't no
[1:14:48] seal see the Holy Spirit according to
[1:14:50] Ephesians
[1:14:51] 4:30 I'm just giving you something to
[1:14:53] think on
[1:14:56] I've come back to a place to try to
[1:14:58] explain
[1:15:04] something I'm Not Looking Back 2,000
[1:15:07] years to an open book I'm not looking
[1:15:09] back before the foundation of the world
[1:15:11] to an open book
[1:15:15] right we're in the time of the book so
[1:15:19] that's
[1:15:20] right that's how the Antichrist you can
[1:15:22] see who he is not but called
[1:15:26] because you're written
[1:15:29] Epistles to know him is
[1:15:33] life and the Greater Works is to preach
[1:15:36] the gospel to the people that take and
[1:15:38] take that word and actually have a
[1:15:42] birth the birth of Jesus Christ right
[1:15:46] come on
[1:15:47] Brothers right to know
[1:15:53] him not to know about
[1:15:55] that's it but the know
[1:16:02] him there no argument then about
[1:16:05] it there's nothing to argue
[1:16:08] [Music]
[1:16:10] about but to know him is life
[1:16:14] amen and to know him then you have
[1:16:16] within you the life of the
[1:16:18] man that I hope you listen
[1:16:21] to that your Prophet said he could not
[1:16:24] preach the baptism of the Holy
[1:16:26] Ghost it had not come into
[1:16:30] manifestation you can't preach something
[1:16:33] until it's in manifestation right now
[1:16:37] tie that and just write that little
[1:16:38] thought down you can't preach something
[1:16:41] until it comes into manifestation
[1:16:44] that's the prophet of God could not
[1:16:47] preach the Lamb of Revelations 5 until
[1:16:50] it come into manifestation
[1:16:58] and you'll find out he wasn't talking
[1:16:59] about a Ram or lamb or
[1:17:07] right he wouldn't even just talking
[1:17:09] about Jesus
[1:17:14] no how many times have you ever heard me
[1:17:17] make this
[1:17:19] statement in the Book of Revelation show
[1:17:21] me Jesus by himself
[1:17:26] anyone any work come and show me show me
[1:17:30] Jesus by himself in the Book of
[1:17:35] Revelation you will never
[1:17:42] find you said well it
