of the Lord if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn where we've been reading in Revelations 1 and then we'll go to John one just remember all the ones that are sick among us and many many sicknesses tonight so remember them brother Joe has made a uh has a copy and he's put some back there downstairs of it's a thing from Brother brandham about the prior and some of you may have it but you know it's it's really a good one um to where that he gives evidently would give it to people or send it to people who he was praying for our doings and uh you know he uh so there's some copies downstairs there make sure you you get one if they're not downstairs get them brother Jo they on pray request on the prayer request all make sure you get them and uh have them to do amen I know there's many sicknesses among us tonight so remember each one Revelations 1 and John 1 Heavenly Father we thank you for all things we thank you for your grace your love your understanding thank you for you and father we just ask you to have your way with us tonight that you would use us to speak your word and Lord Lord just choose what you would have for us to bring and put it in the way that you want us to bring it and just let your love be with each one remember the sick ones father many of be viewing in tonight because they're sick remember these Lord and just reach down and touch each one we love you you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we can believe it and we thank you guide us now as we read your word and keep us in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 we've been reading from verse 10 through 13 I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice out of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou see us write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus and unto samna and unto pergamus and unto Tara and unto Sardis and unto Philadelphia and unto lady OA so we've got our own message right that the Lord has given to us and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and one in the midst of the seven candlesticks and in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one lik unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gir about the paps with a golden girdle all right John 118 no man has seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now the word declare is to in other words bring out into the old open amen or to show or to give understanding or you know of those forms and uh we know that's what God has done in his condescending because that's what we're going to be talking about tonight we're still on the glory of his person all of this is still a background for when we get on to see in the things but the word condescend now listen to what it says or condescending is showing or implying a gracious or patronizing uh descent from dignity or superiority now from coming down all right the word condescend is to wave superiority volunt arily and assume equality with an inferior now that's what the word condescend means so you look up a lot of things brother around says about the condescending of God but it's to wave superiority voluntarily you know all right and to assume equality with an inferior because there would be no need of of talking about condescending if you wasn't coming downward you know for some purpose and what's God's purpose for condescending is to reveal himself to his creation all right and that would mean that he would condescend all right now I want you to listen real carefully with me tonight because uh I told Wade some things the other day that I was studying on and uh it's going to take for a while now some thinking amen all right it's going to take some natural thinking and it's going to take some praying for God to speak to us about what's being said and if I was you I would listen I made a statement years I've made it I forgot I imagine probably 10 times in the pce 40 years I said one of these days I'm going to preach on the godhead you remember that uh and I warned you I said if I were you I would listen because I might be doing it without just taking a text you know to to preach on that so uh I would pay close attention if I were you and I invite you to I invite you to listen and to try to comprehend but mainly now is like I've always said I can't convince you of anything and I can't reveal anything to you brother brandham couldn't reveal anything to us he was the vessel God used Jesus said even my own body in other words I couldn't do it myself page 45 I believe it is Christ of mystery he said the only revealer of the word is the Father which is the holy spirit all right so then he uses mankind to speak to us and bringing it and that doesn't by saying that doesn't anull a statement the prophet would say that a prophet is a Divine interpreter of the word all right we go along with that amen but just remember he cannot interpret the word the way we think it is done he can only bring it to us as God reveals it to him because outside of that it would be his own idea and that would be no different than you and I although I like his ideas better than mine most of the time I don't know whether you do or not but you know he you listen to him you figure out a lot of things but now I know I repeat myself but repetitive things according to Paul is necessary for us to understand and I want to keep holding up some things before you to get you to study to show yourself approved you know a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of Truth Now last Wednesday we tried to preach some about it and I want to go over that and reread it because I want you to see it I've asked you a simple question people say brother Dale you're so deep how can you be any more simple than asking a simple question or deeper what do you believe about God that's simple all I'm asking is an answer what do you believe about God when the Bible says God is a spirit what do you believe well he's a spirit all right now interpret that right amen right okay is he just with no form nothing he's just a spirit is that's your interpretation of the word spirit all right that to me is very simple I don't understand why people to me I I I get so uh perturbed I guess or disturbed when people say brother Dale is so deep we don't understand him now what it is you're not listening right is there any more simple language to speak in than my old southern language that is very poor and and to just simply ask you a simple question is your god real amen that's right of course we we we understand the message so much until we we we immediately when our mind we click but God is an object of worship and he wasn't even god well what was he simple question what was he did he gain any attributes after the fall of mankind or did he always have those attributes simple question did he always have the attributes of Father healer savior God whatever words you want to use didn't he have them before he ever started in any way to condescend cuz see you couldn't go with the scriptures like that and think about where it says that he's Hebrews 13:8 the same yesterday today and forever all right we'll use those again in a minute but you couldn't go with with uh Malachi 3 and I believe it's six where he says I'm God and I change not but see we got it all figured out but he wasn't he not God until some worshiped him well Glory Hallelujah you know how to read but what was he before the Angels worshiped him oh he just Spirit Well I thought and we're really going to get into a few things going down the road a little on this but I thought that the Bible speaks of God is is having a heart that's right I thought it spoke of even even having a stomach I thought it spoke of him as having eyes that's right sir hands feet he pretty real isn't he and then this ask you a simple question is he more real than we are right amen but we want to make that's real that's that's hard wood but remember somebody created that and who was was it that done those things that's right but see thank God that we have received a prophet that could go into the scriptures and break them down and show us the things that we used to wonder about right you know but is your god real amen now was he before he became God right amen and my point is what form did he have and he turns around and he says let us the prophet said that was father and son right right amen right better way of understanding that's why I try to help you and I'm so called an intellect because what why don't you just say word and spirit right now if the scripture is right where he said let us make man in our image then whatever image the man came out to be would be the image of the son that's right and the son would be the image of the father amen that's right right amen that's simple right we just got out of kindergarten we found out English is a language that we can use you don't ever think like that see now we've argued all the way down to about let us oh there must be two see we didn't try to have any comprehension about who we was talking about or any way of looking at that we were only arguing if there was one or two or three right well see then you don't never think about let us make man in our image and our likeness right yep so we can go back and we can do all of the great layout of the message of the theop the the Loos the things and well it was just in the image of that well then what image was that did not your Prophet go beyond the curtain of time did not your Prophet say those people were in theophany did not your Prophet say he could feel them and see them hear them must been pretty real he didn't talk about that just being some spooky world over there floating around all right then if you even use the logic that well well what it's talking about when you're bringing God into something real is you got to get on over into the logos and the theophanies and the things and and we got those big words and we think we really are theological Giants well one plus one equals 2 if the theophany could be failed seen by Moses talked to by Abraham if that's true then what form would the father be oh you just buffle you just buffle my mind you just jungle my mind I didn't juggle your mind I un juggled it if you'd listen well God is just a Spirit Well I tell me what a spirit is would we wind up like they did there when Jesus said after his resurrection he said feel me he said because the spirit hath not flesh and Bone we're going to get to a little quote in a minute that uh you know we were talking Sunday and they didn't know I was going this way and I'll let it go a lot of times don't mention much but have you ever heard this statement from Brother brandom on who is this male chz in the beginning before the Eternal right amen right sure now ain't a theologian in the world can handle that quote and a Lula or whatever you want to call us we can't handle that because that's beyond any human comprehension but a seventh grade education man could express that what about it what about a man that you know those theologians they just sat there and listen to him and we knew some of them personally you know we're listening the other day to some that brother Brandon was talking about and uh met a few of them you know after coming into the message and and uh you know he he'd bring out something and they just you know they just went under the table as we call it or shook their head or just but then once it was said if they were really born again they would know that there was no other way to say it than that right or at least ought to right I mean it ought to be but is your God real or has he just become real yeah you the further we go he becomes more real that's not logical sense because Hebrews 13:8 says whatever he was he is and will forever be right that's right so whatever we see to be had to be back there before we would even talk and he would use in the beginning before the Eternal amen I know I say things that I shouldn't say but you know what I I do a lot of times I think about what brother Brown said he said I'm not doing this to preach Doctrine you remember that one he said I'm doing this to straighten out Doctrine I'm trying my best to get you and me me off of that thing of thinking about Spirit God things to get us to a position that we can see the reality amen that's right of a living God Amen and how real he really is see because you well all right I'll try to get on with the message we've been talking about how real God is and and that he's not a myth and that he's not like the wind and getting it to a position to try to understand to see to understand about God and how great he is yeah all right but you see I give these quotes from The Prophet but I don't just give you one quote I've got four five where he's talking about God is not like the wind and God is not like the air I can give you a quote where he says God is like the air I generally just try to give you both sides of it where you think it over but go back and check the position or situation that he's speaking of at the time that he says those things that's right when maybe in the same message he might say God is like the wind and then the same message I don't think it is but I'm just giving you that it's within a close year or something and then he would turn around and say oh God is Not Like the Wind he's not like the a the amoya the air we breathe you know in and out why do you think he said those things so many times to try to get us to understand stand you know right but look let's read these cuz I it doesn't bother me to read them over to you now it may bother you and you maybe get dull well go ahead and get dull about it and do whatever you want to do I'm just trying my best to help you all right and uh have I become your enemy because I tell you the truth that is my point all right go ahead with number one let's read these over again that we read some of them last Wednesday and look what he's saying you know he's on the adoption series 196 522 paragraph 48 and I said he's not omnipresent in the way that the word speaks omnipresent he cannot be a being and then be omnipresent that's right right if he's omnipresent why would you pray for the Holy Spirit see that's the way I love the prophet he this up here may be the attacks that goes with I don't mean the word attack about but I mean this part here is straightening out the theologians right right because he's telling them you say he's omnipresent if he's a being he cannot be omnipresent all then he gets down to us peons small mind and he said if he's omnipresent why would you pray for the holy spirit is that deep it's deep because we don't want to believe it cuz we don't comprehend it because we've got our mind set on something else that's right and it's destroying our thoughts if he's omnipresent he feels ever crack Corner crevice ever saale fiber everything else there is okay I said why did he hunt for Moses if he's omnipresent at the end why did he run up and down the Garden of Eden crying Adam Adam Where Art Thou if he's omnipresent see he's omnipresent because he's omniscient he knows omnipresent is ever omnicient is to know all things he knows everything because he's infinite being infinite makes him I'm de press do because he knows to be there he doesn't have to be on the moon today if nobody's on the moon right that's right is that too hard to believe that's a simple statement but it's truth isn't it being omnipresent then being infant then he sets in the heavens he abides in a place because he is a being I just can't believe that I've been taught all my life he's a spirit you see what I'm talking about if it gets brokenhearted to me I wonder what that Prophet was when he knew people wouldn't getting it what about when he gets on the seals our seventh seal I'm sure he said it's gone from you it said right around the coming of the Lord how do you think he felt how do you think Jesus felt when he looked over there at Phillip and said Phillip have I been so long with you you want to see God I am him made manifest how do you think he fa look at number two which is taken for Fellowship 196 611 go ahead roll it up some time ago I was dedicating a tabernacle they asked me to bring I watch his wording a brother down in Tennessee I forgot what his name was now the Church of God down there and I said God is a being now God's just not like your like the a if he would you would never have to seek the Holy Ghost would be in you cuz he's filled all space and things God's omnipresent sure by being omniscient knowing all things but God has a Dwelling Place he speaks of his house he speaks of right because he is a being exactly right and God dwells with f dwells with Fellowship under the shed blood of his son and that alone amen and denomination can't figure it out all right won't me him go to number three things that are to be paragraph 38 he's omnipresent because he's omniscient omniscient because he's omnipresent therefore by his for knowledge see all right now he can't be just like the wind over the Earth because he's a being he just isn't a myth he's a being he dwells he even dwells in a house he dwells in a place called heaven and therefore by his Omni being omnipresent being omniscient knowing all things then he's omnipresent because he knows all things all right look at the next wasn't so from the beginning God could not be just like the a is because God has a Dwelling Place God is not a myth God is a being God Jesus he God pronoun he's a being therefore he's omniscient omnipresent omnipotent infinite amen and who is he he's God going on to 4 a which is we would see Jesus 1957 God was the center of that Fountain he's told me in the beginning God was a spirit at and all the Fountain of goodness and mercy and power and all the good things of love God was the center of that Fountain and then the logos that went out of God in the beginning become what we call a theophany or a supernatural body God is just not like the hour but he's in a body Moses saw when he pass by all right look at who is this male chdc number 4B he is a being he's not like the wind he's a being he dwells in a house but being omniscient knowing all things makes him an omnipresent because he knows everything that's going on now so we have by the prophet established the fact that he's not like we think of AR and just being an amoya Ever how that word there he's not like the wind he's a being oh but but Brother D he become a being I'm glad you thought of that so if he become a being he had to be a being before right or he changed right he's not Hebrews 13:8 if he become a being that was not a being before amen that's right is that deep whatever he is he had to be exactly or he changed right amen see I'm talking about a real God Amen I spent 50 years trying to explain this I saw the other day how to explain what I saw 40 years ago maybe we'll get to it in 40 years from now right I don't worry about it but listen Church you know I know it's like I told Wade was going down to pick up brother Louise I said I have no desire to go anywhere to preach I used to I had a desire to preach wanted to go and preach and try to help people I have no desire for that anymore because I know and realize that if you don't listen to what I'm saying you're going to wonder what in the world I'm saying and if you have no background for a time to live listen then you're going you are mly confused I realize that not that I'm that deep I no I'm trying my best to tell you I'm that simple that's right am your intellectual mind is the Deep part right he's not a myth he's a being all right and out of that being he begin to bring forth number five read it paragraph 51 adoption but he is a being God is a being and out of this being begin to bring forth these everything that there is had to come out from him right so what are we talking about look at number six God's provided way now God put man first in his own image which was in an image of God and God is a supernatural being he was a supernatural man now you can say well now brother D you I'll go along with you he's talking about natural man that he created all right natural man he created was a supernatural being or you can say God is a supernatural being cuz that's what he just said he just said he was a supernatural being and a Man created in the image of God would be a supernatural being that's why he was created Spirit man first that's right that's right amen amen so remember let us make man in our image so then whatever Man was created is in the image of God so it would mean God has that if it's in the image of it there had to be something here for this to come out over here to be the same that's right am right am what do you think see God's a supernatural being look at the next one if God be for us where all the Miracles be with us that God is a supernatural being and wherever supernatural being is he'll do Supernatural signs because The Supernaturals in him you can't get out of it he said it's all of this is doing is a working of a supernatural being all right so what do you think about God and how many gods do you have that's right am now how many gods does the Bible talk of I I I thought it spoke of one God that's right but Paul could say the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ one two three come on you remember the Trinity days when we argued with people they was three of them right you remember the trinity in days when we said can't you see are you blind on the river there one was up here one was over here and one was down there there's got to be three of them but how many B how many gods does the bible believe in amen one that's right how many gods did the prophet believe in but yet I can give you a quote where brother R said let's stand and address the third person of the Trinity right that's right right you see Church the prophet could say things and it was really it was mindboggling and it's still mindboggling to us with that we try to run everything with our mind he said if you just simply sit down and think is that the terminologies said well I can't understand what he said if you just simply sit down and think right just simply think if there's three Gods who created who who got here first y just simple things right well what do you think about it let's read a statement and see what you think go ahead to number eight and I want to pick a part out of there and then go back to the to the other uh roll this up and then we'll bring it back down because we'll read the whole thing together he was in other words Adam the first man in the lower creation of God the first creation was God himself now then out of God came to Loos which was the son of God look look that that's at least three I guess we're so spiritual we can correct a prophet so we just tear out what we don't want and you know and then we claim the message that's what it gives me yeah what gets me is the people of this message that's got all these two Soul sth anniversary perus no Holy Ghost uh River Jordans and all these Doctrine and every one of them saying what the prophet say yeah why don't the people stand up and point their fer in their face and say you ain't saying what the prophet said that's right yes sir well now that brother has a right to believe that let me say it this way the brother has a right by the Constitution to believe what he wants to but he does not have a right to say brother brandham taught that now I resent that for him to say brother brandham taught that that is not a constitutional right right but think about it in other words the first creation was God himself then out of God came the logos which was the son of God then out of the logos which was the word what about it how many gods do you have and I know I try to help you but I know what I do I hurt your feelings I can just say this one statement and and I just see people in the building just go I asked you in 1984 somewhere right about then I said when when you say son of God when do you think the Son of God came into being and everybody in the building said 2,000 years ago brother brandham has just put the Son of God before the foundation the world that's right and I thought that we'll prove by the scriptures that Jesus Christ created all things am that's right right sir but see you get offended because I try to dig you out of a hole I went to a Minister's meet one time and these these brothers they were trying to prove polygamy was okay and I just got up up and made a flat statement I said if you think you can believe in one more than one wife and polygamy then go right ahead you ain't got nothing but a lust devil on you well you know they wouldn't even speak to me for years and I was trying to dig them out of a hole that they had already planned who they were going home with the women had already set aside who was going home with who because of their Doctrine and yet I dug them out of the pit of Hell and wound up being an enemy well I ain't going to back off I don't give a hoot about anything but this word and what you think about me that's your business I don't want you to think that about me I want you to think that I love you and try to help you amen amen we sure don't act like it sometimes well I have a funny way of being who I am all right I don't imagine them people down there when Jesus drove them out of the temple with a whip thought too good of him either you trying to make yourself like him no I don't have to worry about it I ain't got the whip okay yet huh but let's read something from this one and I'm sure this is the only quote we'll get but so this is two quotes above where we or one quote above where we were last Wednesday but go back to number eight there and go back up above where we were and I want you to think about paragraph 21 is where we start now if God created man in his own image in his own likeness what kind of a man did he create a spirit man now if you'll notice after he had made all the creation and created a spirit man the close reading is this is to the one that asked the question God give dominion of the C cattle and the fishes and everything over to the man but in his makeup up there he made a man in his own image to lead the animals now that's not the flesh man he made the flesh man later right Genesis 1 f is the first man Genesis 2 is the second man first man read the animals Nam the animals all right okay he made man in his own image to lead the cattle lead the Beast of the field just like the Holy Spirit leads a Believer today he was in other words Adam the first man in the Lord four creations of God the first creation was God himself then out of God came the logos which was the son of God then out of the logos which was the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us out of the logos came forth the the the man let's now question why did Brother brandham constantly reject the doctrine of the Catholic church that said that they believed in eternal sunship he said we don't believe in that he said that's the Catholic doctrine of Eternal sunship yet he has just said this is before the world this is before the creation this was back there and he says that God's first creation was himself and out of that creation came the logos the theophany the Son of God now that's before time ever started we got plenty of writing if you want to go home tonight take your computer and just run it in on your computer and just read run in Son of God put Loos with it we'll cut down your times of searching and just listen to what that Prophet has to say was Jesus God made manifest in human flesh amen that's right called a son right so you'll see immediately that most of your Catholicism Catholic Doctrine is dealing with Jesus 2,000 years ago right of Eternal sunship when brother brandom is back for the foundation the world talking about a Son of God you said you just confuse me simply listen cut off that thing you call a brain that is sitting there I can't F of this out I don't know what he's just saying he's got me confused stop and say say a prayer Lord right help me understand amen because the man has just made a statement brother Brandon spoke of the Son of God before the world cuz he knew the scriptures the Son of God is the creator the father never created anything there's no scripture for that right all things were made by him and without him there was not anything made that was made right Hebrews 1 John 1 Colossians 1 Ephesians 3 that all things were made by Jesus Christ now we know Jesus the flesh never created nothing true amen all right so we got it in the right understanding but I wish you would just just just for a second now listen to me for for a second with your computers cut off and I didn't say blank your mind I got enough sense to know how to read I know what your Prophet said they get people to blank their mind I ain't talking about blank your mind you ain't going to blank it anyway you're going to sit there where you're still the same ideas you had when you got here you ain't going to BL it out and that's why it's so hard for it to come through and that's why it takes Contin repetitious things to break through that mind right why you think it took brother brandom you want a quote from him it took him 33 years I believe it is before he could preach this that's his words yet you can go back to 1956 when you were giv the other day where it's uh the old one is called inter Veil and he's talking about the very nature of God and the Very God living through you and speaking through you and using you and all that's what he taught all the way down but he said I just got this the other day how to explain it right amen I don't mind keep repeating things I do it to try to help well all right now what do you believe about one God now we're not trinitarians the father son Holy Ghost has three Gods right all right we're not Oneness who go to one like your finger position situation and their point is that Jesus was the life manifestation of God that's the oness doctrine all right so we're neither one without Father Son and Holy Ghost God is not complete need that quote he said we don't believe the Trinity Doctrine but said we don't believe the Oneness Doctrine either he didn't say we go in the middle to try to figure it out he said them trinities has got scripture he said them Oneness is has got scripture but what was his Doctrine and simple terminologies about the godhead now when he spoke of the logos of theophany the Son of God coming out of God did that mean God stayed here and outw something that we'd call a Loos or theophany is it that a way or is it a simple form that he said God stepped over in another form right called a son right he just stepped over to another form he said it's a part of God but said not a part like an arm or things he said he just stepped over to another form condescending all right so now the great Eternal and let me say this to you while I'm at it when you use the word Eternal then you are meaning it is something we say it's like a circle but eternity is not like a circle that's only signifying that it has no beginning and no ending right we don't want the three ring circles put up cuz you can get into the Trinity with all of that right but now back before the world ever begun the prophet said to FS you can go back and just say he was Elohim which he said that was self-existing and he said out of that Elohim came the Son of God how beautiful the man could explain the scriptures you know that the father then the great Eternal one this one that was on the other side of before the Eternal he didn't create because that would have not been bringing him out out in the open he stepped over in another form called of logos theophany word speech and then you're right with the scriptures that the Son of God not the human flesh element the Son of God is the creator right how beautiful a prophet could make it that we simple-minded people could comprehend what he was saying not another person went out it wasn't one person standing here and another person went over here it was simply one thing and I emphasize heavily on this because I've seen these drawings that make it look so beautiful you know like one man draw it here was God father and then all of it went over in the sun well it wasn't but one problem he left a hole right here that's right that's what he done he left an empty space I don't believe that I believe all of God can come out and go into the L go and he's still God he's still there and listen that's how f father right glorify me with the glory that I had with thee before the world that wasn't a flesh man as we call because the flesh man was not before the world right see that's where people go Haywire trying to figure it out when they just take simple terminologies because see you know what I'm saying if you say all of God he poured into Christ then there's nothing there here's Christ you're doing pretty good and you're thinking but what about an all Christ poured into the church you're leaving nothing back that way and you got just exactly what the devil wants you to think that you are the almighty God but see now you don't like that and you don't like my terminology you think I'm mad at you or something but if you say all God was he poured into Christ all Christ poured into the church without having an understanding of who God is and what's taking place then you've done away with God and you're making yourself the god that's right come on well that's what the prophet said well amen but he didn't say it like we say it he said out of the father we're going to read it in a minute out of the father came the logos the theophany the Son of God he didn't do away with the father because Jesus didn't do away with the father he spoke to him while he was here on Earth right what what are you doing away with that's why I just say what the prophet said yeah okay just forgive me for being just what I am and just leave me alone I'm happy about it because I don't have to do away with something here to bring it over here and talk about a fullness well I brother Dale all means all you remember the statements all God was he poured into Christ all Christ he pours into the church how do you think about that if all is here there's nothing back there you don't have a Christ you don't have a God you have you and that's the Devil's Playground amen because you're thinking you're that God and that's exactly what he wanted okay now I'm going to tell you what I believe and then we'll read what the prophet said is that simple if I ask you something you say I just say what the prophet said now you going to stop and say something in the middle don't worry about it I done Beyond those days I just say what the prophet said like I told you the two Soul people have quoted for 40 years the soul is just the nature of the spirit and everybody in the message quotes that give me one quote from Brother brandham Where he said the soul is just the nature of the spirit they added one word but everybody around the world is just soul is just the nature of the spirit it the brother around didn't say that I told you what he said no you didn't you interpreted it by putting words in right I believe that back before the world and we'll draw it out when to get back to preaching on it we'll draw line and put there where brother R said in the beginning before the Eternal and we'll go back behind there and talk about that but just remember whatever come into being in this world or ever comes into being had to be an attribute before anything ever come into existence that's right that's right okay so he was already a father he was already a Healer he was already a savior he just couldn't display it that's right right cuz if you don't you mean he gained ground when he come this way he only gained the ability to display what he was that's right watch in a minute when we get down we around and said it's like a child playing before the father's door and he says Let There Be he didn't do away with a father see we take that all God was he pour into Christ all Christ he pour we make that all not realizing that when we make it all we're doing away with all except us well I never thought of that brother Dale okay maybe that was worth you coming tonight to think about that but I want you to show me where it's wrong you see then I have no problems would before the world we'll call him father where we won't get into that word god of course he wasn't a father until he had something to make him a father and you know that how far you want to go with that you know he wasn't a father the way he wanted to be a father until he was the son of man that's a quote exactly from your Prophet when he become I believe it's Christ of mystery I'm not certain that was the only way he could be father was be son of man why because he's a father of this race of people he couldn't be the father of that other than be Creator Those Old Testament saints were not born again Believers right they were anointed right right but not bornn again Believers that's why they'll be servants not born again Believers the way God wanted his children from Adam he got lost in the first day on the day of Pentecost he started looking back at what he wanted right all right that's right father he had all these attributes in him how's he going to get them displayed and when the prophet said his first creation is himself what's he saying is not he simply putting it in human terminologies to where we will comprehend not to confuse us but comprehend that God is going to do something right he's going to be a creation Now we won't get it tonight I know that's but why does it say to Revelations 3:14 and it's speaking of Jesus Christ the flesh man that he's the beginning of the creation of God and that we are the rest of that creation that's right when he says back here right that the Lost of the AL the Son of God is the beginning of the creation of God you see church do you believe in one God or what do you believe I don't know there's a father and there's a son and there's a Holy Ghost and there's a but remember we can't be one like your finger am so here's the father right right out of the father simply steps the form that he wants to use to condescend and he calls it logos theop the Son of God word and then th is where you start with the Son of God saying let there be it was not the father that said let there be he always used a son that's what I'm talking about that's why the scripture in John 1:18 is saying that the only begotten in the bosom what does it mean bosom oh here here we standing God and in his bosom was another person in that bosom he steps out of that and becomes another person ah you got back in your trinitarian concept he says he will declare him that's right bring him out in the open as brother Brandon would say amen right all right here's the father never be comprehended never be understood never be seen because we're on this side he's on that side right amen right is that right we use the Scripture it can't be seen that's right no man has seen God at any time all right out of that father steps not another person the same person steps over in another form I wish every who's got their phone fixed on where you wanting to be so nice about it to keep it from pling pling plinging I mean we got a telephone back there if you're not nice enough to cut off your phone you think oh my kids might get sick and I need to know about it what are you going to do leave we got a phone back there they need us give them the number but if I can hear a phone pinging and doing this as hard as I am a hearing everybody else in the building done heard it but you ain't going to tell me what to do I know that and as this went P your mind you won't shut off them phones because we ask you to out to I'm going to keep my phone on bless God well now that's what you call stubbornness which in the Bible is called witchcraft right right you see where it's good to preach ain't it real good to preach when everything starts going wrong I'll let you do it one day will you see what I'm talking about it's not father doing way and it's not him three4 here but a quarter of him went over here or a half or three ERS no it's the same father uh brother Marlo you're a father huh you know there's no way in the world you can prove that to me tonight right how come mys AR cuz none of your kids are here you can prove that you're a husband cuz your wife is sitting there so you can be that form of husband and wife but you can't be the form tonight of father with a bunch of children CU it's not here do you understand what I'm getting at it wasn't that part of God went out and left a part of sticking over here and it went over here you're not listening to the quotes he can be omnipresent right right and him be a being right why because he is omniscient that's right amen right am he can be the presid and him be a being because he's omniscient right that knows all things right it's not one here and it's up no it's God as the Bible as we read the son is going to bring him out in the open right who's he going to bring out in open God the father right father moves over in another form called a son there's something I'm holding right there I don't won't say anymore I explained it to way because you know if something goes wrong with me then I don't have to worry about it he can explain it all right cuz he knows my thoughts all right something that's very very very very valuable to understand but I can't bring it tonight we're dealing with this and I got enough problems as it is but out of the father comes the son the logos of theophany may I use another words your Prophet will use the Christ amen Amen brother brownon said if you can't see Christ in every verse right he didn't say say if you can't see the father in everse he didn't say if you can't see Jesus in every verse he said if you can't see Christ in every verse so then down to the Old Testament was the Christ the logos the theophany the Son of God that was in the Tomb in the where the fire was at with the Hebrew children right the Christ he was in the lines Den with Daniel the Christ right but then one day that Christ became flesh all right come on but listen see then it's not trinitarianism but it's not Oneness because we haven't done away with this position if you do away with this position and move it all over into another position you are a strict Oneness I don't give a hoot who says well you're Oneness if you do away with any part of God I want to know where you got that at amen I want to know where the audacity of a human being would have enough stupid sense to think about that they could do away with a something of God I thought we were making a circle to go back right right but see if you do away with the father what are you going to do so father a part of him if you want to call it that's the words of the Prophet moved over in another form called a son and begin to create that's not two people that's one person but it's two people the way our brains go well let's read now we got plenty more of these all I ask you you to do is go home sometimes and just get it sit down and do and just run in logos theophany Son of God in your computer and just read all you want to go look what he says here on the it's on the adoption we done done to part of it and look what he says now what a wonderful thing that a man with a s great education could tell you what happened for the world what about a man didn't have no education at all could write what happened in the garden yeah right Moses right let's go back a 100 million years before there was a star moon or anything in the world now there was a time when there wasn't nothing here it was just all forever and Eternity and all ever and Eternity was God he was there in the beginning all right let's go on the edge of the banister and watch he says no man has seen the father at any time no man can see God in a bodily form right because God is not in body form keep on reading he talking about this kind right this kind of bodily form right he's not saying he don't have no form right we'll read on down God is not in body form God is a spirit is see all right no man has seen the father but the only begotten of the father had declared him first John now just notice now there's nothing there's just space there's no light there's no dark there's no nothing it just seems nothing but in there is a great supernatural being amen Jehovah God who covered all space and all places at all times he was from Everlasting from Everlasting he is the beginning of the creation that's God can't see nothing can't hear nothing not a move of an atom in the air not nothing not no hour no nothing but yet God was there that was God now let's watch for a few minutes and after a while no man has seen that no man has seen the father now that's the father that's God the father now notice then after a while I begin to see a little sacred light begin to form like a little Halo or something you can only see it by the supernatural eyes to look now while we're looking the whole church now we're standing on a great big banister watching what God's doing and we'll get right down to the question here and you'll see how he brings it in now no one has seen God and now the next thing thing we begin to see by eyes of Supernatural looking we see a little white light forming out there what is that that was called by Bible readers logos are the anointed are the anointing are the as I was going to say the part of God that begin to develop into something so human beings could have some type of an idea what it was that's it now God's going to do that not a it was a little a little light moving he that was the word of God now God gave himself birth to his son which was before there was even an Adam in or a to make an Adam that was see Jesus said glorify me father with the glory that we had before the foundation of the world see way back in Yonder he gave himself birth to a son that's not a second person right amen you see the reason I love to preach is this way Jesus is not a second person right are you that have the new birth Sons and Daughters of God Amen that's right right all right then you just admitted that God was in you cuz that's the only way you'll ever be a son of God that's right that's right right if that don't blow your head to the other way of trying to think how much intellect is intellect it's simple terminology it's taking away those things what s one he said in the beginning was the word what the first and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us God unfolding himself down to a human being Now watch how he did it now back there then when this little Halo comes now you can't see nothing yet but just the eyes are just Supernatural we see a Halo standing there and that's the Son of God the Loos now I can hear him playing around like a little child before the father's door with all eternity that's not another God church that's right if it is we're trinitarians right that's to where you can say let us make man amen in our own image and knowing that there's not two people well I just can't see how he could be a son now we're going to get down into some wordings you know that all sons has Beginnings that's right right am I right sons have Beginnings that's why we don't believe in Eternal sunship right but we do believe in what Eternal godship is that a quote right all right sons have Beginnings but remember that beginning was not a beginning like we think we think the father created the son come on are we in the church age book about 10 messages later where it says that we talk about that and we think that one made the other one come on it wasn't one making the other one it was that same God just stepping over here to unfold himself but not leaving a vacuum back there or a place because you see now this is where you better swaller and I'll quit the father stepping over into the son is correct but the father creating a son as a separate person is is trinitarianism right that's right right so his first creation was God himself that's right then out of God came the Lo Goos the theophany the the condescending of God down to so that we can understand him amen see when you start doing away with things that always gets me I've heard that quote all God was now brother all means all you want to read what we just read and say all the way you're saying it you don't realize that you got a trinitarian concept CU I thought I thought the Bible said that in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily that's right is that scripture now what's the fullness of the godhead bodily father son Holy Ghost right sir I thought the new birth was the father Son and Holy Ghost coming to live in you well that's three people no it ain't no it ain't it's one God see the condescending of God for God to bring himself out in the open and then come down on Earth and stand there and say if you seen me Phillip you've seen the father didn't say if you seen me you seen the son or whatever and he was all of that God dwelling right there right right what do you think well you just confused me maybe you'll go home and pray right why don't you do something for me why don't you go home and study and try to prove me wrong you know that was the way I learned a lot of things don't tell me you don't do it I'm going to call you a liar to your face you say I don't do that you do you study to show people wrong you study to show thing people that are wrong because you want to show how smart you are boy I straightened him out on that well it's kind of like an old brother was comeing here one time goe musicians come on the old door used to be right here and we were coming in the door and I wasn't being sarcastic with a brother I loved him and uh I was carrying the communion cups and walking in in and to the internet people you know we use many cups but I wouldn't care if they want one cup we'll go one cup don't worry about it but I found out Tabernacle use many cups so we don't worry about that but anyhow we started in the church that old brother he he looked down he seen them cups and he says brother Dale he said all the Believers of the message use one cup well I had a good time to went through all of the things with him wouldn't I that they what did they do at the Tabernacle at make brother Brown a false prophet if it had to be done this way and he done it that or what you know what I said to him I just opened the door to let him come in I said brother we believe part of the message okay we believe part of the message but the ones that's going to get out of here is going to know all the message not know all the message but know the truth is that right what we got brother let's stand together I'll try to get a little more onto this later trying to get it down to where we can see something a beautiful Plan of Redemption that has been made known to a little bride in the end time see then we'll understand one of these days why brother brandham would say he said you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day of your life that's a paraphrase quote and it's off just a hire but it's close you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day of your life die and go to hell that's paraphrase just a high I can't remember all of it exactly but it's very close and he said you know that Kus had the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know he named a lot of people in this message that later went off and you know what he said he said they had the baptism in the ho G but he said if you're born again you can't be deceived he said and if you have the Holy Ghost you cannot deny the word now you can say I don't understand I don't know what's right and what and pray for me but when you say no that ain't right then right there you're on the borderline for good traps and things of Satan but I'm trying my best to get us to see one God because if you remember the thing that I was saying there while ago about it that I was intending to I had been preaching on one God back there in ' 84 and I was intended to move on into preaching some of the son of man and I said that day I said if you don't understand the Son of God they ain't no need of going the son of man I said what and it took me five or six years before I ever got back to preaching on Son of God a son of man because I had to preach to one God and I'm still preaching one God every message is one God cuz that's what I believe in we've had one Prophet one message one God go ahead brother there are some things I may not know there are some place that I can't go but I I am sure of this one thing that God is real where I can feel de with my God is real real in my soul believe and just thank God my God is he thank God for what start thanking him about it thank you thank you for I pray two time tonight every time I wake up you know what I pray thank you for saving me thank you for saving me Lord start thinking father by your stripes our little buddies healed he's been sick he been up and down with this and fighting all these disease and germs and things but we place the blood of Jesus Christ over our little budd's body and condemn you Satan for your doing to what you're trying to do in the body because we believe Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever we love you father in Jesus name amen God is anybody else real in my soul my God is real for he has wased and made me his love for me his like pure go my God is real where I can feel leave in my soul some folks May so some folks May scorn all can go on leave me alone but as for me I'll take God's part and God is real for I can their business they want to know what to do and how to go how we just ask you to come down father and direct them let them see you Lord as you manifest yourself in a mighty way in the business and the things Let It Be You Lord we join hands together agreeing you said if any two or three agree on anything it'll be done so we just thank you thank you for it we love you in Jesus name let's go thanking him for it I can tell let's thank him far say thank you Lord say when Jesus your sins away but since that day yes since that hour God has been real for I can feel his holy power my God is real real in my and we believe you Lord now just make it manifest in Jesus he has and made me the tell don't fear is like pure don't be afraid my God is real for I can't see if you're scared you're not set you're not anchored you don't know you don't understand just don't fear just say well okay Lord hallelu okay Lord that's the way we go most of you know that I've been going to the doctor now for a few months but because my heart's out of rhythm all right a lot of people's heart's out of rhythm well we can believe about it but they put me on blood thiner I told the doctor I said I go along with your program because I believe in medical science I said but I know who's been taking care of me all these 74 years well I didn't know what he going to say he said I depend on him too he said when I get back against the wall he said I go down I come out with the answer well now they say on February the 2nd that they're going to shock my heart try to put it back in Rhythm so it gives us that long to pray right what are you are you scared brother Dale no what is it to be scared of death the only fear I'd have in any form I do is for to leave you my family the kids the grandkid that's only fear I have no fear when I had that attacked and hit me down in the woods I just went out and sat down by the campfire I said just as good a place as anywhere to go from I'm not afraid of dying that end Ender that was done away a long time ago but I'm just afraid that we don't put all of our confidence in him and that's what I want to do yeah you pray that it'll all be back well brother Dale what if it ain't all back well okay I ain't going to worry about it I'll let him shock my heart unless the Lord tells me between now and then to not do it if he tells me I'll tell them they're not going to do it and they told me that I had leukemia I didn't ask them what and how much or what it do I said we'll go along with your program but there will be no chemo because I said I'm on this side of the business you're over there what good does it do with Kyo extend you 3 months 6 months I said we're too I'm too old well come find out I had the kind of they say you'll die with well well don't I care where I die with it or without it they can't prove it I got it because all they can do is go by their test and it goes like this it'll be up and it'll be down and I just life that's why when I go into the doctor's office I'm not going in can't stand it they say how you doing I'm doing wonderful okay I got fussed out long enough to where I do I go in I say Doc I'm feeling wonderful but I got a bad cough can you help me see I'm not agreeing with them then because all the doctors I go to know one thing for sure they are not the healers cuz I tell them they're the help and why can't we brother brandom come up you know I told you I was going to preach one of these days on that comparing Divine Healing and and natural doctors medicine man walks up to brother brandom and said I got this problem he said there's a doctor right down here that specialist izes in that operation why didn't the prophet say you're healed you know what he was healed it just had to go through that doctor but you understand we want to quote the prophet but do we quote where brother Rand said you have no right to go to be pray for until you've been to the doctor first now we don't put it that way to where that we do it we put it where one thing we come here and we pray and then if we need we go to the doctor now you got it in the right place but I see people you know that oh I I'm I'm not going no doctor I'm not going no doctor but you let it you let it hit them one day pretty hard and you'll see them like who was it the other day who was preaching over U Luke Gibson I'm sorry I should have said his name on Earth but he said that what what was it about that that preacher get up and say I don't believe him going to the doctor said you see him in the car sneaking his kid down taking him way off into another County somewhere to take him to the doctor well I'm not that way I'm just what I am thank God for doctors but we know who the healer is right I just need to PA cloth one my niece's husband right on the Madison cabinet his par you remember the story about the chiropractor we went to and they said our business has got so bad and me and Nanny both of us we was thinking coming home boy that's bad to pray for them to get business when that means that somebody's going to be hurting right you know it's kind of funny but we took a park cloth gave it to him and said put it up over the door went back a few weeks later and they said our business is really picked up well all right all right we believe it father we send these prayer cloths not that it's it worth anything not we're worth anything but we know who the healer is and who the leader is and the guide and we pray that you would just be with these and as we send them they're just a contact made because we believe you and we thank you father in Jesus name am amen amen anybody else that have a need before we go uh the quote for today I don't know y'all listen to it or not but he talking about going to the doctor and the doctor G an asp for pain he also said a real doctor find out what's wrong with you exactly he said exactly right I going to give me a a clue shot the other day and I'd already had one and it seemed that was a lifetime thing and I looked on like shot let me tell you that right and but anyhow the doctor left and the little girl come in going to give me a shot and we got to talking and uh she was telling me all this different stuff you know and I thought she had two pieces of paper and I thought I better go study this thing out see what's going on yeah I said I just passed I'm coming back next month I get next I can't I said you know they ain't one position I said all the rest of practic and she laugh she agreed with me 100% I took me two pieces of paper and I went home and put it on my scan machine and sent it down to my daughter my daughter's going to analyze or get it analyzed and tell me what to do I don't want pneumonia me but you know I found out there's 177 well I always use the word 17,000 like I'm sitting on 17,000 you know like but I forget how many different kinds of pneumonia that they are right and it's somewhere somewhere around 20 like that you know and happen to be just one shot don't cover them all no and this flu shot that everybody takes in one found out that it covers 23% you know all the rest of get flu but anyhow that's what brother R said right you know and like Gil said about my man Lord they my blood pressure went I went fluid about 2:00 and I thought I don't know I'm going to be able to go church tonight or not but I kept fooling with it and finally it got normal but all she done was raise the medicine up that I'm taking so mhm and and I'm I have I have white cat syndrome everybody know what white cat syndrome is yeah pray to the doctor parents got one back there parents tell them if they ever had had a white Coat Syndrome they all be thanking God Almighty that you don't have that thing but all I got to do is I'm going to go right all I got to do is think I'm going to doctor Tuesday and and and and Monday evening or or sometimes money man they just start going pay like that I don't know what I said all that brother but I tell you how that things can be pray that they don't have shot right that's what we're praying about but see things in your body as he said you blood pressures and things going on I sat down there at General Motors one day and they took my blood pressure my nephew was with me and I turned around and looked and he said that's up a little bit I said give me about two minutes I sat there for a couple of minutes and I said now do you believe that I can lower my blood pressure 15 points he says no way Che it again 15 points it works they don't like that CU that's when you got the feeling you believe it you believe it you say it you say it stand on it right anybody else anything before we go I remember U mother called me down the basement one time and her feet were swollen twice the size and she said I want you to lay hands in prayer and we laid there I laid hands on and prayed and watched her feet go back to S I believe it I believe it because I've seen it just go you know I was coming out of the grocery store today and I've parked pretty far away from the grocery store and I was walking down through there and I said Lord I just thank you that I am able to walk to my car we just take so much for granted in life and we forget to thank him for the things that he's given us and we we look at the negative of the things that maybe might be going wrong instead of the things that are just one right you know right you know if you've never been sick you don't have to worry about thinking him about anything but when you're sick can you see God come on the scene and heal you then you know and realize that there is a God to take care of it right father we thank you for tonight we pray that what we said Lord maybe not the way we say it cuz we're human I'm sorry but yet there's just one goal in mind and that's to get the people to see you Lord and see who you are what you're doing we pray that you would bless us now take care of everybody on the way home give everybody a safe Journey we love you in Jesus name amen amen your dismissed and when this battle's over we should wear a crown yes we should wear a crown yes we should wear a crown and when this battle's over we should wear a crown in that New Jerusalem
