we'll get our scripture out of the way then brother Timbo has a testimony he wants to give to us so we'll do that so if you'd like turning your scriptures turn to Revelations 1 Genesis 1 and job 33 Revelations 1 Genesis 1 job 33 I want to thank everybody for praying for us during all of that time you know that my heart was out of rhythm and everything else kicking around but they shocked it back in there Monday and it's okie dokie so everything's fine there's no problem and uh we just thank God for that everything's really really in good shape so we thank you I talked to brother Claude weinger this morning and he's uh doing better you know he had a a minor I guess you call it a mini stroke or whatever and he he said he was doing a whole lot better they still some tests and some things that they're doing so you know we just we appreciate the Lord taking care of him and uh I forgot to do it last weekend we're glad to have Sister Barbara back with us cuz she'd been gone for about a month there and with her husband on a trip and but we're glad that God took care of and brought her back to us and all of that so we appreciate it uh remember now the that brother Aaron will be preaching is coming Wednesday we haven't had two you know we off two Wednesdays and because of bad weather but maybe everything will be all right this Wednesday but brother Aaron the Lord willing be preaching for us Wednesday remember the Bible study will be Saturday at 6 remember the fellowship meeting will be on the 3D Saturday at 3:30 and brother Matthew Bray will be preaching that and on into the Sunday services so getting all of these announcements out of the way if I'm missing any heard from Wade he's doing great that he preached yesterday which you know they're they're day ahead of us about 13 hours or something and uh so he's he's done that said they had I believe she said June didn't say had 250 300 people or something in the service and and all so that's it's working real good and pray that the Lord will bless but now that he needs his clothes because Delta is real good at uh losing things and they're and I understand they have a big thing but I've been to Jamaica about 10 11 times and the only time I ever flew Delta they lost everything I had so the only thing I had was the carry on but they're trying to get it and working it out and through sister Mila and talking and everybody they they've I think they've located his clothes some of them but he's doing all right so he's I guess he's found out what I said was true that over there they like that thing of what they call them Baron it's a it's a thing you put over it you know those great big chics and all them guys wear them great big fancy ones with these are a little you know a whole lot less but you can wear them and they call them a they say you're like a tuxedo when you're wearing that and uh boy when I found it out I didn't wear a tie after then and uh so he'll he'll be in good shape so I think he had to go out and buy him some but you know to be able to do cuz they were all in his luggage but the Lord will take care of him I just pray that they'll bless and heal they're going into some ministers meetings and things that they're going to be having and he'll be you know be put to the test because there'll be some there you remember the story was when I was there and we had that ministers meeting and this brother he kept asking this question well I just it was just something in the way he was setting I couldn't get it and the brother was blind but now you talking about quoting this message I mean it's easy for him to say paragraph 278 Hebrews chapter 3 book one you know and you can turn over there and read it cuz he he he does that but I couldn't figure out what he was to saying so I said brother Ernie come up here and find out what this man saying I don't mind answering this question but I want to know what he's talking about you know what he's asking me well brother Ernie got up if you remember and told him said well we got a blind man asking a question and said we got a deaf man trying to answer it so we was you know we got his an or do no amen but we'll go ahead and read our scripture and then we'll get brother Timbo to come up okay father we thank you for the day and the hour that we have and thank you for all things and we ask you to just bless and guide each one of us Lord be with way there and give him Lord whatever has need of for the times and all of being there with the people and Lord we know that they're receiving from you the word that we would receive here if he was here ministering to us so we pray that you'd bless bless and Open the Eyes of each one's heart and the hearing Lord of each ear we love you and we thank you Father and guide each one here now open our eyes this day remember the the promise in your word because there's many sicknesses and things among us and you said in your word that you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we Praise Your Great Name we love you and we thank you in Jesus is your name amen Genesis 1 we'll read these and then I mean Revelations 1 excuse me let's drop over to save time reading verse 12 and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candles sticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gir about to paps with a golden girdle now let's go to Genesis this is one very familiar scripture with all of us and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion now notice them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and ever over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them now if we get to this scripture we will be trying to cover you know a little bit if it don't we'll pick it up in another Point got a marker there it is job 33 and verse 24 then he is gracious unto him and saith deliver him him from going down to the pit I have found a ransom you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word the Timo would you come up and just he has a little testimony and he wants to give us about what the Lord has helped him and done so we appreciate it and uh we believe in God dealing with us right yes sir bless you buddy let's go ahead God bless thank you all right all right most of you got guys know me you guys all pretty much know who I am but um you guys don't know nothing about me where I came from in the background I come from I grew up in this message my mom and dad my mom and dad raised me the best they can they gave us the best we've always had but I went out and did stuff on my own wanting just I was addicted to heroin for 10 years cocaine alcohol just whatever I could I I the spirit was in me hated myself it didn't want to live but so but I had the escape from I came to visit Joe and God really helped me out from coming here with you guys I learned a lot and but them Spirits were always there even though I know that this message it's all in my head you know what I mean it's all I've been taught this my whole life and um I just want to give you a little background where I come from but it started about uh last month it was the 28th this brother called me he's been he he was a stranger to us at one time he just came and visited us and he said um it was like 6 months ago he told me some things only God would know so I knew God spoke to him to his heart so once then that kind of scared me it got me enthused for a while but it went away I just kept doing the same things I said oh I'm all right I had a religious spirit on I had a religious spirit on me I was like okay I got it all up here but I was still doing wrong things and um and I just I couldn't do it I couldn't do it no more and he came about the 28th of last month he came he called texted me and said well brother God wants to do something for you and the Brethren down there in lincolon he said fast and pray he's from he's from Africa he lives somewhere up here um Greenville but he said fast and pray tell the Brethren to fast and pray up there and we'll uh he said we'll we'll fast and pray uh just pray for me nervous but you guys are all seasoned in the word so all right but he said fast and pray tell the Brethren to fast and pray down there but in the back of my mind I just blew it I blew it off I never told nobody I just he said I want to come down the 29th to preach and we'll preach and God wants to do some stuff and I just blew it off and never told nobody but he came that Thursday and preached he preached we had service and everything seemed normal and fine and then um and then that well that night he wrecked he wrecked into a wild hog after he left the left the church and um and he texted me that and then he was supposed to come that Sunday to preach but and then that Friday me and Esther got in a big argument and stuff and we were fighting and and uh she said I'm tired of this I said she said I can't do this anymore and um I was I was just selfish the spirit in me was selfish and now could look back and see how selfish I was yeah even though I thought I was doing right and stuff but I wasn't right I never had a true experience with God and um she she I'm going to leave you she told me and that that Friday I was going that Friday I was going through a lot and I just

New Mexico and they're talking about how beautiful and how wonderful it is over there and I was like but then those Spirits were still telling me well why don't you just jump off this bridge right here just telling me inside my head and I said I ain't going to do that I ain't going to do that and um but I just felt so uneasy that whole day because they knew they were going to be exposed that night those Spirits so I went we me and Esther and she didn't feel comfortable without Mike and Sonia there and I'm glad they were cuz we all got together and we put all our cards on the table we talked about everything and I didn't feel better or nothing after talking about nothing I just felt the same I felt nothing changed I felt the same we went home she I said she's all I'm going to go to Augusta I'm going to go back to aners I said why don't you just go home I told her go with Mike and son they live right next door to us I said go home and um I'll follow you guys down there in a minute after I go say bye to Mark so I went over there to brother marks and I drank me a big cup of coffee and on that way home I about wrecked the car about three or four times by falling asleep I couldn't stay awake and then that morning this I'm I'm on Sunday morning now we I woke up for church I woke up for church we got up everything seemed normal like just like nothing happened just I was at ease like my mind I was saying this is strange because after all we talked about she should be mad and stuff but everything was just at ease and I was like okay and then that brother texted me and said hey brother I'm not going to be able to make it this morning because I wrecked into that big wild hog and total my car and I it was just a text I said okay brother I said please pray for me I'm going through a lot we went to service that morning this is the first first of the first of the month went to service and and uh and everything went normal just like a routine just everything was just fine and then all of a sudden that brother walked in the room at the end of service we're about to be released from the service and all of a sudden once he walked in he walked in with his family and then I was like my mind said that's strange and then my stomach just started twisting inside and I was like oh and then brother Jean's like well you could preach this afternoon if you if you feel led to he's all I'll wait on the spirit of the Lord he said and I said and then he's he's all okay and then we didn't even get outside he shook my hand said I need to talk to you come to the study and um he said I ain't here to preach he said I'm God sent me here to talk to you and we went back to the study we talked to he talked a little bit he just said BR he said brother God wants to deliver you and stuff he said these demons are laughing at you he said because they think they're going to come back he said but you just don't have the power right now to overcome the these spirits and I said well I agreed with him I said I believe that cuz I try to quit chewing tobacco or smoking or whatever I did quit smoking but I just threw it in the closet I never got delivered and it just came back in a different form of tobacco and the addiction was always there it just changed its form into pills and it just changed its form so and I truly wanted Deliverance every time I came I always wanted to pray I came up sincerely in the bottom my heart wanting Deliverance but them religious Spirits were holding me with those were just didn't let they didn't want to get evicted you know what I mean they just let me get so high so that he took me to the back of the study we talked a little bit and he said he pulled out a a message book that Jean gave him the last time he was there he said he said brother and he read me some quotes and I he said um there's a light he he said um he said you can't do this on your own he I don't remember the exact quotes but he said you can't do this on your own and um you've been trying to do it yourself this whole time and you can't do that and I said I said yeah it's true he said there's a light inside you that you can't that it's there there's a hunger in there but these Spirits are too strong for you you can't overcome right now but God's going to give you the power to overcome them and I said I want the power and stuff I said that in my heart we talked a little bit he said go get sister Esther oh he didn't know nothing what was going I didn't tell him we were going through no problems or nothing but he brought all this out and I was like and then I knew it was had to be God With Us and he said go get sister Esther and I went the house got her and said come on come talk he wants to talk to us and he talked with us and he said he said write this down sister Ester and he gave her a piece of paper and said write this down small town of lincolon he said um not very much jobs too much work to do around here um not uh not enough resources just a bunch of list what was on my heart I I got it tacked up on the wall at the house but um just a list a list of what was on my heart I didn't tell him the only thing I told him I said there's just not I'm not making enough there but he all this other stuff he brought out and had her write it down for me and um he looked at me and said brother Timothy what on this piece of paper is worth not doing God's will and I looked at the list and I said nothing's not worth doing God's will I want to do God will and everything and he said okay brother we're going to he talked with Esther a little bit I forgot what they were saying but he said he said brother we're going to pray for you he said and he got we got in the corner of the study he put his hand he put his hands on my head like this and he said sister Esther stand behind him and hold his hands like this and she held she was behind me she held my hands and um he said we're going to pray we started praying and um all of a sudden I I talked to God in my heart and I said God God if you're going to do something for me oh I I told him first I said I've been trying to do this my myself my whole time and I keep failing I can't do it no more and I was sincere in my heart I said I can't do this no more I said I can't do this no more and I said God if you're going to do something for me I need you to heal my stomach and my liver because I abused it in the past that I really abused it in the past and all of a sudden I spoke that of my heart all of a sudden that brother reached down and grabbed my stomach and said uh heal this brother from all the poisonous things he put in his body and then all of a sudden I lost I knew it was something Supernatural I lost total control my my hands started squeezing so tight they were squeezing so tight and like they started curling back like drawing back and I I realized I didn't have control over my body and my mind was saying stop stop this and I couldn't stop it and I screamed out as loud as I could I screamed I with with all my mind I screamed as hard as I could but no voice was coming I was like like like that and the awfulest taste was coming out of my mouth like a metal or a sulfur and my eyes F they're going to pop out of my head there was uh snot coming out of my nose and then all of all of a sudden I I said God help me cuz I was scared of death I I couldn't control myself and when I fell to the floor I was up against the wall was like this and I was up against the wall of my neck like that I couldn't move he said and I was and then all of a sudden the burning and fire stopped coming out of my it was like pull P me forward cuz it was coming out of my face it felt like those Spirits were coming out and all of a sudden those um I I was on the floor shaking I didn't have I couldn't get up my mind was saying get up off that floor you can get up and I was trying to I couldn't get up it was just I was shaking I couldn't move he said sister Esther go get some water and she ran in there I don't know where she got the water from she came back with some water and he said in Jesus Christ's name I turned in Jesus Christ's name turn this pre this water into your precious Holy Blood and he sprinkled it on me and rubbed my head on the top but now that I when I get excited about it my head still feels numb gets numb on top but but after that I got I he helped me off the floor and I was in shock I was shaking I was I was scared of death and I he he I said brother did you cast The Demon out and he said brother I didn't and then later on that night then he he left and I went and took care of some things that I didn't have the power to take care of before but I went and took care of them and um but I haven't been the same since amen you know what I mean my appetite's changed that it's it's been a reality to me so much every promise in that book is mine I'm going to be the one to take a body change you know what I mean if God wants me to do it he's going to give me the power the strength the words to say it to do it but and then that night I I fell asleep on the couch and the dog started going crazy about 3:00 in the morning just crazy barking at at like in the certain area of this room of our house his barking and at that time I had a a dream about this man he he had a little snake and he had his mouth stretched wide open he said stick your hand in here and I was like I ain't going to do that and I woke up and then the dog was still going crazy and I I said I prayed and went back to sleep but then when I woke up I realized I've seen that snake before in a dream but the last time I seen it that snake was so huge going through the rafters of a house and I didn't have the power over it but now I have the power to overcome it's it's a reality to me now it's so real it's so real amen see God is still real he is still real if we'll just take it and believe it he'll come to it may take a while sometimes he doesn't come on the scene as as quick as we think he needs to but he's there he's always there you don't have to worry about it he'll be there when you need him righten amen and amen appreciate that testimony cuz we're talking about what a living God Amen the reality of understanding that God is real not just a thought or an imagination or you know things are a spirit as we talk about you know God is a Spirit Well I believe that that yes but then that spirit that God can take a form and appear and be a lot more well you know that was part of him to start with that wasn't uh you remember we talking about the attributes of God how did he had all of those attributes in him before the world ever begun and in doing that then you know we look at him and we see that he's real he's not just a thought he's not just something in your imagination because until you have an experience with him that's all you can believe I I don't care who you are or how much you think you know or whatever you cannot know God the prophet said without a definite experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's only in your head and that's what Timo was talking about sure he had it in his head he's tried in his head to work out things he's tried in his life to do you know and been there with him some things and all he's tried to work out things but you don't work them out with your head right you got to get a reality in your heart then something can take place well then see that's the way that I've been talking about God he is real he's not just a thought or an imagination or you know a good thought because there's doctrines of that that people actually teach you know that that God is just the the good thoughts and the devil is the bad thoughts and you're the rest of it well where did you come from you know that's the only thing that I say but now see that's what we've been talking about and you know last week we were talking about the message of how we look at the creation and we can understand the Creator by looking at the creation by looking around us we can understand it and we can see how real he is by seeing what's around us and what takes place but now like I said until you have an experience you don't know what people's talking about you can talk about it you can talk about what is and what was be or oh we've seen that in people we've seen them but and you know then you can uh through the parts of your imaginations and memories and things you can work up some of your own experiences to where you can think oh I know this is real because this that the other but without a personal experience God's not real to you a guy years ago you know said God is dead well see to 90% of the people of the world God is dead because they don't have a living God Amen you all right but what about you and me how real is our God Amen right and dry trying and driving hard to to try to make us to understand if there is a Creator we can look at his creation and see him amen because that's the way he works he reveals himself through the people that he's made all right and what was the last thought that we had you know we were talking about not that God has a soul see that's an incorrect terminology you know it's not that he has a soul because that means it's just something when you start getting into the nature part of it you really get messed up but to realize that he is a soul amen the soul being what we gave the definitions of seeing talking about it a soul is a being it's a person right that's what a soul is that's what Webster says in that's what the definition of the word literally means that the soul is the real you all right we went through talking about even that see the soul is more real than your body and your spirit but yet we can see the body and we can watch the reactions of the spirit part of us and we think that's more real than the soul really is but remember as we'll get to it in a minute in Matthew you there Jesus says Don't Fear them that can destroy the body right said but but fear him that can destroy the soul well there's no way that the soul can be destroyed by mankind you just release it from this human elements that we are if you kill somebody you know it just that Soul leaves out and as it leaves out see then it's got to go somewhere all right the prophet saw Souls under the altar as we'll get back to in a little bit and see but we're so greatly revelated that's that's what gets me about people till you say Souls under the altar that's fifth sealed Jew brother Dale don't know the message well I'd invite you to go back to the prophet's message and just run in talking about souls in prison or Souls Under The Altar and just study it a little bit and see what he said about it cuz that's all we're trying to do I'm not smart enough you're not smart enough no human being is smart enough to be able to do anything uh I have some some scriptures when we get back to it if we get through there today on the soul of talking about it how that that it says there's no way that a that a brother can redeem amen you can't redeem me right I can't redeem you that's right amen there's no way all I can do is try to help you see he's the one that has to do the redeeming and only he can do it only he as we read there has found a ransom for the soul of mankind well if he's found a ransom for the soul of mankind then God is a soul yeah but we just but we just see that's what we've been taught all of life right we don't look at what we are and try to comprehend you know what you and I are and understand what we are what's motivating you well it's just a spirit motivate well a dog has that right a cat an animal has a spirit part about him but they don't have a soul right all right and see by not having a soul they're not a real being that's right they're an animal all right they're real to their part of what they're supposed to be but they're not a they're not a real being see that's what I'm trying to get you and I to see and and the first quote is one we use before many times so go ahead brother and we'll just read this and and get started on it cuz I like to uh I like for the prophet to do it I have one in here that where I've got about two or three pages that we're just going to read the whole thing you know because he's the one with the answer then you can't argue with him so you can argue with me I don't believe that I got quotes too well you know you mean you got a contradiction in the message just like you believe there's a contradiction in the Bible same old Spirit right but look what he says this is questions and answers on Genesis paragraph 13 and look what he gets down to talking about he's talking about God formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground breed into his nostrils we haven't got to that yet all right we'll get over there Lord willing maybe this evening or next week one but trying to stay back there to understand and the only way we can go back there to understand is by way of the Prophet well we got the scriptures what we need a prophet for we need a prophet to tell us what the scriptures are saying he didn't change the scriptures they said what they said to start with we were the ones who had that self interpreted to the point you know that we believed it meant this right it wouldn't ask for a raise of hand but how many was trinitarians before we heard of this message right well you know there's no such thing in the Bible well yes they are we believe it you know well see you're not going to convince people head arguments is not going to work now how many times have I made this quote to you I'm not speaking to your body right CU all I can do speaking body to body is get you mad at me right right I'm not trying to speak to your spirit because that gets into the memory the conscience affection and see then you can start looking at me and and I'll say but but brother so and so you done wrong you done wrong too that's body and spirit fighting each other that's right and you're not going to listen to what I'm saying irregardless of if I told you that God told me to tell you that you're not going to believe it cuz you're going to go away in your own self I told him off he told me I was wrong I told him he is wrong and ain't none of us no good we're all just problems well ain't nobody got no problem with that we know that but I try to speak from an inward part of me that God has spoken to me about this and I'm trying my best to express what he speaks to me about and that's soul to soul that's not body to body that's not Spirit to Spirit all right it's from an inward being that I believe is the holy spirit directing me and see as long as it lines up with the word word I don't have any trouble so then I have to read what the prophet says to be able to make sure I got it lined up right right you but you don't have to read it all to me brother Dale well you got a smart elic mind right there and you're automatically admitting up in your spirit not in your soul that you're wrong in your spirit sorry because have you ever noticed brother Brandon brother Donnie and I talk about it yesterday have you ever noticed him right in the middle of the great uh preaching of the seals and he uh he said I want questions and answers on what I've preached here on the seals he said don't make it these others just kind of paraphrasing it don't make it to other things as much right now let's put it right here and what was the questions he got what about Matthew 28:19 compared to act 238 should women wear pajamas to bed go in and check it he got one question and I imagine about the time he got that question I'm just honest I figure he's probably so uh downhearted until the only question he got does you know first Thessalonians about the man of sin you know said said does that fulfill the first seal he said yes and went right on to panty hoes right I don't know what went next but I'm just making the point right right the man was probably so down and out long about that time he thought I guess I just need to quit and go home but you know what he done he just answered answer them questions he said this is a question on somebody's mind he said they want to know about this I was trying to remember it I believe I believe it says the baptism we was listening to a tape the other day and and really it was funny to me cuz you know how brother brandom is about it and it's right about you know when he's up speaking he don't want pictures taken he don't want things moving around he don't want thing because that's the spirit part uh and and he'd say you know don't don't ask you don't ask nobody a question while they're trying to preach you know I mean you say well anybody got a question that's a different thing but we were listening to One in which I actually started lifing you know what he was doing he was explaining water baptism what to four ladies to Four Women and those women were talking back to him all the way through the time not necessarily arguing with him you know no no them saying now brother random you're wrong it would but all through that whole thing he was talking to them Four Women about water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and they was just talking back to him and just saying things while he's saying it he said that's right sister that that's what I'm trying to explain you know I thought he sure got to be a good Christian even hang on with that let alone a prophet cuz you've heard him say this statement right you ever heard him make this statement he said somebody wanted to question me about I believe it was water baptism but anyhow something he said I found out it was a woman preacher and said I didn't contact her to talk to her but here he is one time that way here he is the other time you know that he just I well I'll try to remember it and we'll get it but I believe it just says the baptism or something in that order I I'll get it off the tap and tell you where it's at but you see Church my point we've got to believe what the prophet said all right and forget what we think I was explaining something to brother Donnie there yesterday that I believe you ever noticed brother Bram own the stature of a perfect man and uh you know he he never uses the scripture that actually says stature he doesn't use it it's over in Ephesians 4 I think is that right where he talking about coming to the fullness of the stature there's a scripture there that says stature s t a t e that we talking about he never used that scripture and emphasize that point that see there the Bible calls it a stature and I told brother Donnie I said I believe the Holy Spirit does that a lot of times where people can have a lot of things to argue about couldn't you see some old Theologian sitting there said he preached all that message and we can't figure out what he's talking about cuz it looks like you're born again here you're born again there you over here and over there and he said if he just went over there where it says stature well you know maybe God didn't want him to do that maybe he didn't want him to use that word you see church he was a prophet and thank God for it I know as a human being he made mistakes right we believe that we understand that there was mistakes the man made even in his teaching that God had to correct but you know what there wouldn't a man in the world could correct him Clarence Lin taught the white horse riders Antichrist for Brother brandom come along go back and read a little bit but he wouldn't have profit so that was still sealed until it broke to the prophet and he wasn't responsible just get to T see that's the way I I I believe it and that's why I want you to read what the prophet said even if I keep reading it over and over go ahead with a quote Brothers I'm sorry he's talking about what connection they ask him a question does Genesis 1 126 have to do with 27 where God it says God created two men all right then look what he says well now if you'll notice close now in Genesis 1:26 let's get the first part first God said let us now let us is a let us make man in our own image our course we realize he's talking to someone see then right there this people's minds gone you know was he a trinitarian he was speaking to another being you remember the one we gave the other day where he says to the animals R said God said to the animals let us make man you know the animals were made before the body of Adam was made but we'll get to it in the message out a while the soul of Adam was made before the physical man that's why I said you read five and six in your creation of that day and you read it you you got a problems right there and understanding you got to deal what he said he was speaking to another being let us make man in our own image that's Father and Son word and spirit no problem with us now right but there was a time we had a problem with that and maybe you still have a problem well I just keep saying it over and over so one of these days we'll get it you can't have two persons up there arguing with each other over how they going to make man amen that's right if you're going to believe in one true and living God right well he was really a trinitarian and he deceived you and I he done a good job because I still believe it let us make man and I were after a likeness and let them have dominion over the catle of of the field if you'll notice in creation the first thing that was created of course was light want you you come on down through the creation the last thing was created was what a man and a woman was made after the man all right the first last thing was created of God's creation is mankind well when God made his first man if you'll notice he made him in the likeness of himself he was made in the image of God and what is God now what you now if we can find out what God is we can find out what kind of a man he made all right but just turn that quote around a little bit and read it this way we find out what man is we can find out what God is because the man is to be made in the image of God is that something to be hard to comprehend just think of about it if you're made in the image and we proved over and over that that word image doesn't mean a picture taken or something to look like or or a cologne no it can't even be a cologne can't be a identical twin can't be none of those things when you say in the image of God that means whatever God was right that's the way he made the man or there's something wrong with our sensible understanding I'm trying to get away from saying stupid so much okay but Church listen to find out what kind of a what God is we can find out what kind of a man he made but see if we find out what kind of a man was made we can find out what God is and as I started off talking it's not that God had a soul you remember we went through that Sunday afternoon where brother Brandon would say he put a soul on him see everybody see there he didn't say he put it in him he put it on him it's just something he just put on him and well it must be something pretty real the soul of an individual because remember it cannot be destroyed by mankind that's right I don't care what you do with the body the spirit or whatever you do anything with it cannot be you can't destroy that Soul so the soul is the real you amen right all right well brother Dale how big is my soul cuz they found an in square compartment in the human heart remember he says they say that could be the place of the Soul he didn't say that was what it was he said that's what they say well see we want to put an in square compartment well what do you need an in square compartment for come on what do you need an inch square I'm a little bit bigger than some of y'all I might need an inch and high Square Aaron gets 4 in off the top okay do you see what I'm talking about yes you use in human terminology to try to speak about things well man automatically takes the human terminology and interprets what he wants to be said amen instead of listening from the heart he's listening from the head and he's comparing it with his spirit to see whether it works in his love this that or the other you know just remember brother Brown says you don't love with your body he said you love with your spirit you display it with your body you can't love with it has no no doing it see taste feels smell and here doesn't work too good all right but the find out what God is we just look back to the man that he made and we see that how God is real cuz he made something real right right all right then why can't we believe that look what I I love the way brother brandom will bring things and and it strikes me as a as things you know I I look at those things maybe you don't but when he says things I I look at it and I I think about man I wish I'd said that I think there ain't no way in the world theologians and things can come up with the wording that man come up with but yet to them it look so carnal look at this next quote I I I get Plum you know look at number two what he says on the message called look and he gets down life comes you know the confessions and things but just getting down to the quote part there is that life of God as a Son of God born by the blood of God and you're you're the same holy spirit that wrote this Bible will focus it right back into you there's not a denomination or a Creed that can do that only God himself can take a hold of the camera of your eyes am now how greater could that he's and let you see what God is and what his purpose amen that he can take the camera of your eyes now you know you can't see you know what he's doing he's walking back into the human being part he's getting back into the real you because the human eye is not seeing all right the spirit is reasoning memory conscious and things and can get that all out of focus but I had just to happen when time reading I know if you ever let it be that you could stand and look at somebody and walk back in yourself and see them as God was seeing that person it'll stop you playing around it'll stop your condemning boy I tell you what they need to get straightened up they go clean her around your own door first right but that happened one time and I thought oh God I saw that person as he was looking at him right through the blood of Jesus Christ that's how he was seeing him but now what's what we're talking about see we talk about God as a spirit but we read many quotes and many thoughts and points the prophet would say that he's a spiritual being God is a supernatural being that he's not like the wind he's not just blowing out this this everywhere and all he's omniscient he's omnipresent and we went through explaining those things the only way he could be omnipresent was to be omniscient all right because he's a being right and the brother brandom was the one that said it he saidh would God be in the garden saying Adam Adam Where Art Thou when God created every Speck of dirt every tree everything that was in that Garden right I told you I said some of these days I'm going to preach on God with amnesia you know what now here's God standing in the garden he knows every move everything that's there but yet he's hunting atam oh he just done that to show well your prophets wouldn't said it I didn't he said God come down looking for Adam and he said Adam Adam Where Art Thou right now you explain you say well I just can't explain that well you explain how your sins can be put in the sea of forgetfulness and we'll talk an eternal God that cannot never stop I mean his thoughts are beyond our thoughts or anything but yet he can annihilate our sin and they're gone in the sea of forgetfulness and cannot be brought up by the devil you explain that when we don't have no problem explaining the others but you see church that's just what I'm what I'm trying to get us to see he's a supernatural being he's not like the wind he is all of those great things a prophet would use Father Son and Holy Ghost theophany logos speech all of the great uh things of talking about him the L of the valley the rose of Sharon the bright and Morning Star all of those things but yet he's a person and brother Rand you remember we gave it off of paragraph 78 of the I I don't give this to them but the unveiling of God where he said he's not the first person or the second person I not the second person or third person he said he's not the first person he said he is the person right now why would he emphasize that he's not the first person CU if you got a first person you could did a little a little bit to talk about a second person so he put it in plain language am that Theologian just go but Haywire sitting there listening to it well he says he's not the third he's not the second he's the third he's not even the first he is the person what I mean to me that's the way he's condescending to reveal himself that Blinds To man's ideas right that comes to the right order and then that Prophet could look down through and see what God could see of what we talking about the camera of your eyes and look through and see by the supernatural eye of Revelation may we say it that way where you'll understand what he's talking talking about when he said we're looking by the eye of Faith he said not the natural eyesight of the thing we're looking at the supernatural by Supernatural thing what by Revelation you ever noticed this one that brother R made it really you know it didn't throw me but it really throwed me in a light he said you know how these discernments and things work he said said it's Revelation you ever noticed that it's Revelation how did he know what house number the people lived at or whatever you say he's seen it out there well why did he have to see it out there he can see it by Revelation I ain't saying he didn't see it out there I'm just saying why can't you talk by Revelation by the eye of Faith by Revelation because I said to start with the human body can't comprehend what the Bible is saying the spirit will reason upon those things and it it just gets it all that's where your confusion is at there's no confusion in the soul it's either confused or it's of God because there's only one nature of that Soul you're either born again or you're not if you're not born again the prophet said souls in prison if you're born again the nature of your soul is God he said but if you're not born again the nature of your soul is of the devil or the world all right simple point of just looking at it what do you see about God well brother D I just I just used to think he was just this yeah you used to think he was just a spirit but now remember these statements and you might not like them a spirit can't heal you right a spirit can't save you right right as father and if that was as far as he went which would have meant creation to bring us into being that would have been great but he couldn't be a Healer he couldn't be a savior I hope it's doning on you a little bit the reality that I see of a living God that he's real he's not just a thoughts of your mind he's real amen Jesus said if you've seen me he said you've seen the father no he he just he wasn't talking about see this thing he was saying if you could could look through but there was no way that man could look through and see God standing there until the day of Pentecost that's right that's right but when the day of Pentecost come he knew what Jesus said right right you see what I'm getting at yes we covered in in great length or have been covered that the kind of man that God created was created in the image of God now we try to deal with that as a point of looking at created I keep going back on that because maybe it's in my mind all right but we look at things that's created you know something that had a beginning right well when we go on down into another quote in a minute to where the Prophet said your souls was made before the foundation of the world we need to get away from that created idea he's the beginning of the creation of God according to the revelations 3:14 right well you know what that makes people think God created Jesus and Jesus created everything else I read you the quote from it can't believe can't believe right see we get it all figured out and I face this one every time I say it I'm going to say it again but I remember I'm talking about your spirit because but the time I ask you the question about when did the Son of God come into being you answered 2,000 years ago now your spirit right now is rebelling because you don't like for me to bring that out but how come you mean if I saved your soul from hell you wouldn't love me I don't I don't get that but you see we know that the Son of God was Creator right we see when we talk about creation we always want to talk about something with a beginning but see how could he be the beginning of the creation of God and be eternal but you see to look back and see it as not a creation we want to look at the world and it had a time it started right we want to look at man and had a time it started that's right all right but what about going back into God's mind until where we're dealing with Supernatural things and then we want to talk about creation see then if God created Jesus and the Bible says that Jesus is the creator right that true Colossians 1 John 1 Hebrews 1 James 3 I mean Ephesians 3 and9 Revelations 4 then see our mind is hooked on creation as some form of a beginning when Christ never had a beginning that's right the L go the speech the theophanies the things that we use they never had a beginning right they were just God in another form that's right and then see I say that that those attributes was in him he wasn't no savior till he come into the world I've got a little sense whether you believe it or not I can think sometimes but when I say attribute that he had the attribute of healer then he had that in the beginning or he gained it when he got over here you got a problem whether you know it or not you got a vast problem I'm speaking to the spiritual Mind of a lot of people's mind mankind then the logos that came out of God would being a second person the Son of God that came out of God would be a second person like you're saying and you're right exactly where your trinitarian Concepts come from that's right then Jesus would have been lying when he said I and my father are one he's saying what I am the father made manifest that's right wasn't that what he was just saying believe we see looking at what God made we can see God looking at at what he made we can see God looking at at God and we can see what he made right or else we're going to have to change the scripture where it says in the image well see we want to make the image another likeness but that lust that theophany that Son of God that came out of God in the beginning wasn't another person that's right right it was the same person in another form that's right what do you believe about God I thought there was only one eternal life right now would you like this quote you know brother R said there's no such thing as two forms of eternal life you need that one I'll be glad to get it for you there's no such thing as two eternities it can't be there's one Eternal somebody remind me to pull that up with a computer bro joke can pull it up just put it in there brother Joe and then you can shoot it up on the screen that there's no such thing as two eternities maybe that's not the wording exactly so they'll have trouble trying to find it but listen so we're getting down then to where that I want to do a lot of reading so don't worry on that you can on your own but for those on running the screen pull up number three see I sat down and I read these things and I thank God there was no way for us human smart elic intellectual Giants there's no Theologian can talk of the Simplicity that a child a can understand what God is talking about by way of a prophet there's just no way look what he starts here on questions and answers it's why I ask you to listen to that message or read it I'd suggest you just keep on reading it and the one who is God there's another one on that to do and before the next week next next week or week after next sometime read who is this male jesic you know brother Al once's real good about it he called me he said what should I read next what can I read That's related to the message and I'll tell him in advance what I'm I said this go to who is this m chassid you know go we'll get there eventually but look what he starts off talking about this is paragraph 21 and it will go through paragraph 32 or 33 so forgive me I just like for you to see what he says you know that a lot of people never read you know that I say something to you and you'll say I remember one person said I sat there and said brother Dale says so and so and said I say no way in the world brother R didn't say that he said in just a minute he flighted it up on the screen and there he reads it I just want you to see how simple a man can talk but yet the greatest Revelation could ever be right and look where it's at back in 53 and look at him now if God created man in his own image and his likess now this is one we've read a lot right but we didn't keep on reading we've read this quote right here about five times already all right what kind of a man did he create a spirit man now if you'll notice after he had made all the creation and created and created a spirit man the close reading to the one that asked the question that God give dominion to the cattle and the fishes and everything to the man who the spirit man now not the flesh I mean the flesh man not the spirit man let me get it right he gave the the control of the animals to the spirit man the flesh man inherits that by the way he stepped within him that's what I was trying to get to the point stumble over it to get the right answer he gave Dominion of the cattle and the fishes and everything to the man but in his making up there he made man in his own image to lead the cattle lead the Beast of the field just like the Holy Spirit leads a Believer today see he was in other words Adam the first man in the lower creations of God the first creation was God himself see that just blows our mind if you don't have Revelation I'm sorry I'm talking to your soul I ain't talking to your body or your spirit you can't take your body and spirit and figure that quote out right it's got to be revealed right right and I can't do that the Holy Ghost page 40 is it 45 uh Christ of Myster God reveal it's either that or future home 45 that the Holy Ghost is the only revealer of the word that's right all right but watch the first creation was God himself then out of God came the Loos which was the son of God back before the world then out of the L God which was the word now watch in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us we bring that quote and we got there's quotes for it but we bring that thought of in the beginning as to bring it down to be Genesis 1:1 right go that's as far as we can go back in the beginning was the word but now he's back up in eternity talking about God and how that things are to be unfolded or is condescending downward and he's using John 1 cuzz remember you better get John 1 because I believe the John 1:1 is in the beginning was the word the word is with God and the Word was God and verse 14 is where you get in the word was made flesh in between there and it says and all things were created by Him who the word so it had to be back there all right but look look what he say says oh I got a beautiful picture in my mind now we'll read this and quit okay let's go back a 100 million years before there was ever a was a star moon or anything in the world now there was a time when there wasn't nothing here it was just all forever and Eternity and all of ever and Eternity was God he was D in the beginning well let's go out let's go out here on the edge of this banister and look over and see these things happen now no man has seen the father at any time wrote it up a little where everybody can get it watch now no man can see God in the bodily form there's no problem with that is there because God is not in bodily form you can't look back there and see a 16 element person standing before the foundation of the world you know what I mean body read it with sense right CU look what he gets on all right no man has seen the father but the only begotten of the father had declared him John 1 John right but now notice now there's nothing there is just space there's no light there's no dark there's no nothing it just seems nothing but in there is a great Supernatural being Jehovah God who covered all space of all places at all times he was from Everlasting from Everlasting he is the beginning of creation that's God can't see nothing can't hear nothing not a move of of an atom in the air not nothing not no a no nothing but yet God was there that was God now let's watch for a few minutes and after a while no man has seen that now that's the father that's God the father because you can't see God the father right you can only see him by Revelation remember Peter you've seen me you've seen the father Peter's looking there and said uhuh I might have been able to speak to you a little bit about you by being the Christ but you sure got me confused now now notice and after a while begin to see a little sacred light begin to form like a little Halo or something you can only see it by spiritual eyes to look or what the camera the quote the camera now while we're looking the whole church now we're standing on a great big banister watching what God's doing and we'll get right down to this question here and you'll see how he brings it in now no one has seen God and now the next thing we begin to see by eyes of Supernatural looking we see a little white light forming out there what is that that was called by Bible readers logos or the anointing or the anointing or as I was going to say the the part of God begin to form begin to develop into something so human beings could have some type of an idea you remember we put a couple of messages on part of God Heart Of God arm no no it ain't that it's terminologies all right now God gave oh excuse me little white light moving and he said any type of idea what it was begin to develop that was the word of God now God gave himself birth to his to this son which was before there was ever even an adom in the or a to make an adom that was see Jes Jesus said glorify me father with the glory that we had before the foundation of the world see way back in Yonder Son of God not two people remember the son is the father made manifest in another form all right now in St John 1 he said in the beginning was the word when the first and the Word was was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us God unfolding himself down to a human being now now watch what he watch how he did it now back there then when this little Halo comes now you can see nothing yet but just by eyes of just Supernatural we see a Halo standing there now that's the Son of God the logos now I can see him playing around like a little child before the father's door with all eternity and now and then in his imaginary makeup he be to think of what things would be and I can hear him say who the son right I can hear him say Let There Be and when he did an Adam burst and the sun came into existence she s for hundreds of millions of years forming clinkers and burning and forming like it is today still burning still breaking Adams think about it think about this great person that we're talking about and that how back before the world ever begun whatsoever we can find that word Son of God but that means trinitarianism is Right CU you got to have father son Holy Ghost that's threee not if the son is the same person in another form right now you got your one God Doctrine correct without going now remember how we kept bringing it out the one the trinitarian doctrine says a three so they like to quote like that that here's the father and here's the son and here's the Holy Ghost but they don't like when it says and these three are one well three are one it can't be explained right ain't that what everybody says it can't be explained now what you're saying is I can't explain it but you ain't going to say that so you're going to say it can't be explained you remember the big man that said that years ago and I told you about it I said but the only one problem was I don't believe him he said it can't be explained the Trinity can't be explained he could no way he could explain it but if he just sat down and listen to brother brandom for a little bit of course he wouldn't have been what he was you know all right but now watch watch the point like a child playing before the father's door that's not two people but look it's not trinitarianism right but now if you go the other way you've went into Oneness when you're just taking the one like that the one like that you're doing it you you've got the problem with the all God was he poured in and you got the empty place to come over I spent time trying to explain that to you did it help you any and all Christy pours in the church and you ain't got no father you ain't got no Christ you ain't got nothing but the church but you see you've got to keep this thing to where that they can always be Father Son and Holy Ghost as being one but the problem in our human mind is we're one see father son Holy Ghost well on the River Jordan the one that everybody likes to talk about you know I mean the river where he was baptized where it come down you know and here's the son and here's the holy ghost coming down like a dove and voice from Heaven see that's scripture but that don't prove trinitarianism that's right that proves true one God because if you was a Oneness you couldn't have that example are you listening give me about two minutes you couldn't have that example if you're just a Oneness cuz oness means all this goes over into here and all this goes over into here one like your finger or only as Jesus was the life form of God and that's contrary to scripture cuz the Holy Ghost came on the day of Pentecost as a form of God so know you're wrong you see why you can be just as wrong on wondess as you can be on Trinity I don't have any problem with a father and son talking to each other I talk to him I think I'm a child of God and I talk to my father don't you yes right well where's he at I don't have to holler to get him down but I will remember what Billy Paul said his daddy told him one day he said he come in he would late getting to the meal to eat you know now this is what he said so not have called his name but that's all right he said he bowed his head and said his bir said he dad looked over at him and said Billy do you believe God heard you he said yeah he said I didn't hear you well do we have to scream out loud for God to be able to hear us he's not deaf no I can whisper to him in the night can't you but I still like to raise my voice because the Bible does say about the prophet in the days of the voice of the seventh angel it doesn't say in the whisper or the thought right it says in the voice of the seventh angel the Bible says that the children spake often one to another they or give a thought transplant did you get it said they spake often one to another and said a book book of remembrance was written
