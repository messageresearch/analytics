is he that has part in the first resurrection on such the second death had no power but they shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years and the future home brother Moses help us Lord if there is one here that is called to this wedding supper of the Lamb this dozen of years a millennium ring and to them enter into the state after the Hyneman honeymoon is over the Millennium is Mary the honeymoon then cheap the bride takes his bride groom takes his bride home his first or pregnant bride mm-hmm oh he's gone to prepare a house and become engaged maybe we may be true to him too easily who is the word for hear the word regardless the other strike to set us keep us away from or draw me nearer he said the future home of the the government bride is coming back into the wedding supper it's going to be there three and a half on this paper said three and a half days but he still has years then return again in the milena on a honeymoon and then he's going to bring the city interview like the bridegroom taking his bride to a surprise that little bride stands there and hop as she looks at her future home and by faith today Lord we see it younger it'll be right here on this earth you promised it your church would be completely redeemed and one of these days commend your work be redeemed the rest of the particle but first you have redeemed your people their bodies that made up the world now you don't want to minister are you a honeymoon when you get married right you might go to the Bahamas symbolic so we don't want nobody behind right so we want to love everyone and have compassion on each other especially that people that take care of their elderly people like your mother and your brother and sister you know somebody make a church life say something to you Michael Pena or something and you say well good I'm going home but when you get home your mother your brother sister whatever might get mad at scream at you but you don't give them the right medicine or something listen we don't have compassion on each other let's go to Ephesians 6 verse 36 38 he said Ben grieve not the Holy Spirit of God were you thoraseal until that day a redemption said let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be kind one to another tender-hearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you 12:3 he said therefore whatever you have spoken in darkness shall be hurt in the light and that the truth has spoken it in the ear in the closet Chubby's proclaim upon the housetops restoration of a lesser brother says he says are strictly and Melina's I believe in a millennium I believe all these Hebrew prophets and through the ages spoke on that Golden Age and millennium coming I believe we're going to have it we will reign here with him a thousand years what think he approached the verses Sunday over in a great millennium we're just going to think oh I just know would mean this way what would I have done see how much more could have done if I just know what I was going to be well now you don't but my faith we had faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen is that right see faith that doesn't see it he doesn't with his eyes he sees inward eyes see all Christian armor the whole armor Christianity is supernatural there's nothing to be seen the whole person deal with the supernatural there you know just what's Armin where's the front Oh what think you encrusted 53 look a 1953 question Vanessa just leg goes in that time just elect takes the millennium all the umbrella what type of people should we be I want to live through the millennia there lay aside every weight and the sin that so easily 7 Elmo says something wrong oh there's something this way pray for him and keep on moving let your wonderful time to be said towards God nobody else makes it you make it well there's going to be an elect was going to live through the millennium age and we will move him and hop with Christ for a thousand years and they shall go up to glory with him and return again what is the brand talk about that little guy in the Vice he said don't look to the right to the left look to where we want to go today another goal there's another one all questions Anessa Dylan was there yes 54 he said when a judgmental said and their books open now Jesus came with ten thousand times ten thousand up Saint then the druggie mental state here they are all around the white throne judgment as we went through the scripture with it and the books were opened and another book was opened which was the book of life and these that are a rapture were judging them is that right then they die my home and received their glorified bodies and lived through the Millennium was human white throne judgment judge and those he said he was separate the sheep from the goats and the water separation River City say no many teacher the school say that the promised land represent heaven but I think they represent the Millennium because they were wars and trouble still my promised land they come up but in my opinion the church tonight in the states of the old church age Kalish cornea where they were wondering about after refusing to walk in the light a 1955 results decisions he said we're no longer in he Joe so we done pulled up our tent states and left come through the Red Sea the blood of the Lord Jesus see know that all habits and things of life drawn the test master that drove us through it they're ballrooms linked to the cocktail lunches and so forth and seeing all the drunk on that drum like Pharaoh and his horses and then now we're in the wilderness moving along following the angel of the Covenant that what was spirit and knowing that we're on our road to a great land they'll be here during the days of a millennium and we're going for that thousand years a millennium ring he said now a lot of people type the promised land over there Palestine with heaven it couldn't be because they had Wars and things in Palestine so they don't have no award and so forth in heaven it's a type of thousand-year reign on their own a bit of Christ three stages of the journey and we're ready now nature is to my opinion the spiritual span to enter into the third scene that makes people that hunting I like this one here they said they don't calorie he says some time and go out of the down in Kentucky later brother Charlie cuts and he said we're a better brother Brandon do you think in the millennia and you and I was scrolled huh I said I don't think so charlie he said well we're like a so well do you think we will get we will when we get in the Millenium I said no they don't want to be no killing in the Millennium have you save her well well we just like it I said Charlie what if I could convince you that at one time you were a Hogg and you never a still higher to being to being a human being would you ever want to go back and enjoy the pleasures of being a hog he said no said see you you would be so much harder than the pause now you're a human you never want to be a hobbit anymore I said not multiply that by 10,000 and that's what you'll be when you change from here to what you will be you will never want to be you never want to be human again then that's right it'll be something different I'm so glad for the thought of it knowing that same day we will climb higher so sorry by the way it sort of was and question is an answer deuteronomy 59 i'll be a read back in their enemy so i wanna get - always not that much I mean read back and do it other man there were the spider-man right in there and tasted the things of Canaan he's painted and it's not a type for that millennium I may know that you mean just one hand juni or doing whatever name it that's right Canaan is not too tight but I'm within here because they had Wars fighting killings and everything else in Canaan Panama is a type of the Holy Ghost Egypt is the world that they come out about wilderness it's where they were sanctified a calling our church Canaan is where they settle down with the Holy Spirit see because they still that war and if you don't mean you had worse oh just get the holy spirit ones yeah brother Graham said I want you to come at Chris dinner you know that was to homeboy three goals 1960 now you nastácia the or the patient or the moment you accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior and going in the room there where they'll be seeking the Holy Ghost and God will pour out the Holy Spirit upon you and then you will be filled with the spirit and give you power to live live as Christians until the time of the restoration of all things when Jesus comes then you'll be taken up with

Eunice some millennium you're going to be something you're right now some an if you man make the others or just give you a little cold taster potato and thunder wait you go ahead but I got a full course meal full course dinner the Holy Ghost 1960 fellowship said the church has labor against him for six thousand years and the seven thousand years of the millennium and I'm immortal to all creation and God has redeemed his church told Adam today you eater of the day you died when I left when unless a man lived through the time of year it's a type coming moral day he will never no more destroy man and never no more be same that he's be back in fellowship with God eternally amen that's right we go right here now 1959 prophet like unto Moses he said the full gospel of businessman has been one of my great support in taking me to help fulfill the purpose that I believe the Lord's telling me to help help do that was to unite the body of Jesus Christ together that's it's my purpose to do that that's what in my heart to seek all of God's children in one Accord and we want hard moving on and I believe when that takes place that work will be up the over then and there millennium was set in a rapture will come 59 questions in answer I made a read back in Buda remember there were spies laying right in there and tasted other things in Canaan which Canaan is not a type of the malignant theory doesn't yeah 1961 and Jesus Christ this the same and that's a secretary but God promised would take place heavens the North would be on fire and burn the Fuhrer he said before the great and terrible day of the Lord shall come the war the world will burn up with that fire of Malachi for seven it in Russia shall walk upon the pastures volcanic ashes their victory we could in the Millennium right 61 Revelation chapter five and right here ties the whole thing together yes sir have to be worthy so Jesus is worthy as his return we will fulfill all the fullness of redemption blessed meek shall inherit the earth man and woman she will be back sons and daughters of God and the complete millennium ring will begin what a beautiful day [Applause] let's go a revelation and I think there's going to be a response and readings where you guys from help me out okay not to make Scripture but revelation 19 116 19 1 and after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying hallelujah salvation and glory and honor and power unto the Lord our God and again they said I'll do it out always up for ever and ever before and it was came out of that throne saying praise our God all ye his servants and ye that fear that came both small and great be plan and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and any wife had made herself ready and he said on the meetings right to bless write blessed even the name we shall call unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of God [Music] [Music] and I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and then rushes Nestea and mouth goes a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nation and shall rule them with a rod of iron and he treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God called together Brown said what was it his people that just crown the king of kings and Lord of lords coming back to this watery temple unknown it where the presence of God to live and to reign through the millennia with his church they make the appearance with a mighty king to take her place and recite the near royal anointed temple b61 gabled instructions to Daniel and man came to mean a lot more said Oh sister McPherson taught at the church that the church would go through the tribulation because we will be shining lights in that time it's Israel then not the gentle potential the Gentiles has done gone the church they don't have to go through tribulation the dragon spur water from his mouth 17 chapter and made war with the remnant asleep in verges Phenom II the real church is gone on she done at the latest supper for these this face of time where the wedding supper will be going on the last week and that's when the tribulation sets in when the locals and the persecutions rise upon the churches big things like that Senate and in 1900 here to country them or bridegroom Alleluia king of kings and Lords our Lord a vesture dipped in blood and heavily horse riding on white roses horses coming with him and she comes to take her place for their millennium [Music] 1962 spoken words over some say but what he failed to do Mary did she took the word he took Satan's lie Marik - Cosworth and through Mary's seat to replenish the earth again through his brain through the word will and will bring up the millennium 62 here you him little that Israel knows when they seem gonna come up there they thought the Mohini was right on for them they seemed God smite them Egyptians and drown them in the Red Sea and perform all kinds of signs and send them there on that Bank in Marion with a tambourine beating and shouting jumping and Moses thinking in the spirit why they it wasn't but about three days away from glory land daddy no they forty years they have him yet neither the Pentecost knew when the Holy Ghost fell on them sixty-two we will see Jesus their actions speak louder than their words because the time has come where we will not need no military forces anymore just one fanatic to pull the trigger the whole world will grow up I am but I do not believe it will happen God cannot defeat his own purpose the herd was put here and there will be a millennial reign upon that thirty one thousand years death the church is done taken away so that one of these I'm going to be blown up so just rest assure that is important to happen just two but yeah brother brother but they're not gonna blow up the whole earth they're just not cleaning up that's
