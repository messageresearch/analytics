========================================

god bless you says all right praise the lord i i get to break it in we sure we sure appreciate all that all the work i i think brother joe called me last night to reformat my slides for this this new format they were still up here after after eight o'clock so they uh they they really put in a lot of work all right hebrews chapter 3 verse 8 to 11 we made it up to where we're talking about in that timely that sermon that we were just listening to brother brown was talking about exactly what we've been talking about going to the promised land so everything just works in continuity i think that was um questions and answers from 1961 was that sermon that they were playing so it says in hebrews chapter 3 harden not your hearts is in the provocation and the day of temptation in the wilderness when your father's tempted me proved me and saw my works 40 years wherefore i was grieved with that generation and said they do always err in their heart and they have not known my ways so i swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest and we know like brother brown was just saying in that sermon that rest is is the uh is the baptism of the holy ghost and everything that goes with it and when we get over it the closer we get to as you read through hebrews chapter three you can see that paul's leading up to what he's going to talk about in hebrews chapter 4 which starts off talking about rest and what that is and and so he's the further you go in this chapter he's kind of leading up more and more into talking about rest and and especially in hebrews chapter four you you begin to see that he says they could they didn't enter into the arrest because they didn't believe um and you know you think about as you go through all these these circumstances that they went through um it it it it's like little mile markers along the way where they they had a chance to make a decision and and we we've also got little mile markers along our way where you have a chance to see are you going to believe what the prophet said are you going to believe are you going to believe that there is a baptism in the holy ghost and you need it are you going to believe like the woman at the well and and uh are you going to do like nicodemus and just say well uh you know jesus told me that i need the baptism of the holy ghost but he wasn't found in the upper room so are you going to believe and and do like uh you know where brother said that enoch did everything that god required and so god gives us these requirements you you got to be baptized with the holy ghost you got to go down in the water and be baptized by water you've got to add to your faith virtue you got to do all these things and and of course it's not us doing it you just believe in and god will work it out in your life now so if you don't believe then it's it's like provoking god so if we go to the well down at the bottom sorry go back to that i didn't realize it was on the same slide provocation is action or speech that makes somebody annoyed or angry so of course you know anybody that if you if you say something if you tell somebody a promise or you say i'm going to be there at such a time or you're going to make a make a statement and if somebody doesn't agree with you or doesn't believe you then it's that can be a little bit aggravating so so the same thing with god if he makes a promise to us and we don't believe him like he promised the children of israel that if if they would just believe him the giants wouldn't matter they would be able to take the land it didn't matter uh how how rough the land looked when they got over to kedah kadesh barnett it looked like the land they said the land is just going to devour us that doesn't matter just believe god's word and you you keep moving on so on the next slide brother brown said they heard it but they didn't believe it god come down he showed them a pillar of fire showed by his prophets signs and wonders he was with him they didn't believe it they liked to see the miracles they liked to hear the prophet but as far as believing it they didn't their lives proved they didn't now he said don't you fall after that same example of unbelief let us not harden our hearts and fall in that temptation back yonder of unbelief for will rot on earth and that'll be all of it now now we'll we'll get into that a little bit further as it you know uh the warning here is that they all died in the wilderness and jesus said they're everyone dead right so we'll get it that's uh that's we'll get into that a little bit more as we go along try not to jump ahead um so the first we're going to just kind of background some of these provocations were where where they got to a place of decision and and they failed to go on with god's word so the first one we we looked at just briefly last time ready to turn back because of hardship they got to a place where the pharaoh began to keep on these extra requirements for them and they were ready to turn back and let's go to the next one they got to the red sea and you know and then brother ryan preached that message why christ speak and they got to the red sea and they failed they began to fail to to to see the promise that god had given them that he was he was able to make a way now keep in mind as we go through these stories there's really two stories that's unfolding one is the children of israel one is that like the people sitting in the pews and the other is moses now moses you know he he's got he got to a place where where god kind of got aggravated at him too why why are you crying to me you know what your purpose is now now watch as this story unfolds as they go through the the children of israel keep they they keep uh coming to a place where moses moses can recognize it they're not believing what's god what god's word and he wants he wants them to believe it's just like a parent watching your child you know they make bad decisions and you're like if they would just if they would just do different or whatever or or you think about think about now the example we're trying to show here is that ministers watching watching people in a church you know they disbelieve or whatever and and it that's the story that mo is unfolding with moses and now you watch what happens is moses has a little problem he's got a little temper and and the temper is so the temper is what what caused moses to not be able to go into the promised land so the children of israel the people in the pews can go into the promised land for their reason and the moses the minister couldn't go into the promised land for his reason so those are the two stories unfolding here now you think moses he's standing he's standing in the kind of standing in the breach standing that he keeps interceding jump when god wants to just destroy him and wipe things out he wants to he he he stands in the middle and says and plays the role of christ and says god don't don't destroy him remember your promises and things but then finally he gets so fed up with him that he smacks the rock so desire to turn back so that's number two out of 14. and then then the next one if we go to the next slide they began they got to bitter waters a rough spot and they started murmuring and saying i i wish i wish we'd have just stayed in egypt and and the bible says in verse 25 and there he proved them prove them and said if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the lord thy god and we'll do that which is right in his sight and we'll give ear to his commandments and keep all his statutes i won't put any of these diseases upon you my what a problem a promise of health the promise that god will take care of them and they continue to doubt god's word now on the next the next slide they got to a place where they they began to get hungry and they they started wondering where they were going to get food now now you think you think now let's let's look at the spiritual application over here they begin to doubt that god was going to be able to provide them food and and so that's where moses or god gave the promise to moses behold i will reign bread from heaven for you and and you know the next one right after this is is that they began to get thirsty now think about how those two things always go together in scripture hunger and thirst the bible says that if you hunger and thirst for righteousness you'll be is it your blessed just just to hunger and thirst for righteousness even if you're not filled yet if you just want it you're blessed just just to want it and and you think about the how those two things go to hunger for the word and to thirst for the word to be manifested for the spirit to come to quench the word or to not quench but to to make it manifest you think even when jesus was talking to the woman at the well he said the true worshiper is going to worship in spirit and in truth so you know you you could those two things go together you you're hungering for the word we want the word but then then when you've got the word you're hungering for the word to be made manifest because what what we'll say like what good does it do if you have all the charts and all the background if if you still got a temper and you're maybe dropping a little curse word every now and then and doing things that makes the makes your family and the church raise your eyebrows at you we want to we won't live a real christian life to have that life man manifest in our lives so so uh we're hungry we're hungry and thirsty we're hungry for the word we're uh and we'll we'll get to the there's more more to say about the word when they begin to complain about the manna but let's let's keep moving on so the next one they began to the to to gripe and complain about now having water and moses struck the rock and out of it came came water and then number six if we'll go on to that one y'all lagging a little bit i appreciate y'all number six i know i know i'm moving fast so the golden calf so moses went up to the mountain to get to to get the revelation that we'll say the revelation of jesus christ and bring it back down to the people actually written by the finger of god and instead of now brother brown would he would he would always use the illustration of a golden calf whatever you want to put in in front of god but a lot of times it would be money and and you know you've seen uh all the prosperity preachers and uh and uh people make the gospel something that it's not and hoard up a lot of money and start preaching different because they won't want money and they won't they won't preach the truth and you the golden when you start saying the golden calf is the thing that brought you out of egypt then you're you're ignoring the real the real main thing so the bible says in exodus 32 the lord said unto moses go get thee down for thy people which thou brawlest out of the land of egypt have corrupted themselves they have turned aside quickly out of the way which i commanded them they have made them a molten calf and have worshipped it and have sacrificed there unto you and said these be thy gods o israel which have brought me up out of the land of egypt and that's the first time that moses interceded for the people it jumped in the way of their destruction and pleaded with god now if we go to the next one number seven out of 14. so there's when the people began to complain about the manna they said there's nothing at all to eat beside this manna before our eyes they begin to get tired of the word now now you say well how can we apply that to today now you know um i think last time i mentioned that most of our most of our christian journey is moving up in a state of sanctification i i think hopefully we understand that now and i think brother hyde even mentioned most of your journey is under that ox anointing the ox laboring and pooling now now let's maybe let the holy spirit put the put these things together for us so so you know you you get in sanctification what are you doing you're you're packing that word in so now and you're trying you're trying to get somewhere where the spirit can quicken it and make it alive that's the baptism of the holy ghost even before you're born again when when you're in sanctification you're coming to church and you're trying to figure things out and you're trying to work out your salvation with fear and trembling and you're trying to trying to get all that word pic packed in and then then god fills you with the holy ghost and the new birth and things begin to come together the things these things start to come together so if you if you if you're complaining about the manna what does that look like it looks like somebody's saying well we've already got it all we don't need teaching we don't need teaching the word because then you what are you doing you're complaining about the word you're saying well we've already got we've already got what we need is the baptism holy ghost yeah yeah you need the baptism the holy ghost but first you need the teaching you need the manna so when you we've got all these uh this great rich the great riches of wealth that of the message we've got uh daniel 70 weeks which is a revelation you've got to see that before you can really see the seventh seal you've got to see that and and and who was this melchizedek and christ the mystery of god revealed and and all these great reaches and if you don't pack that in then what can the holy holy ghost quicken you so would you say you you say well we don't need the word or we don't need teaching you're doing exactly the same thing that they did back then you're complaining about the man are complaining about the word and brother and and moses i was going to say brother moses brother moses said you you look look at moses maybe just kind of get i'll take a quick detour real quick moses was discerning what was in those people's heart right you know sometimes we major on discernment and we want to we we want to say so and so has discernment or whatever thing but i believe that every born again believer can discern by your revelation whether something is true or not you're actually sitting here right now discerning whether these things that i'm saying are correct or not now now moses because discern means to tell whether it's true or not so moses was looking at the reaction that the people had and he was able to tell whether it was correct or not like like for example that somebody the other day somebody called me on the phone and they said bob you and brother wade and brother hayek brother haye was saying the same thing that you and brother and brother bob you and brother wade never have been preaching about so now now now i was able to discern that's a good thing that's you you're you're being able to you're you're putting the dots together you're you're connect something something something beyond a chart or just something the minister's saying is putting the dots together for you when when you begin to see how the picture fits together so now moses is looking at the um at the reaction of these people there's nothing at all beside this manner and he was able to tell or discern that their heart was not in the right place that they were not seeing correctly what god wanted them to see he was able to discern something was wrong i think i mentioned earlier you know you you hear some when some when people echo back what's being preached you can tell what's whether whether you can tell what whether something's wrong or not how can how can you tell how can you tell because what is it of faith or not if you're preaching something then somebody echoes back well i i i don't know if that's right or or they they're echoing back confusion or they're echoing back doubt like these hurt were here then then it just shows that you're not quite at the right place yet and so moses again we're telling these two stories moses looking at their doubt he's starting to get frustrated and he's starting to get down and he said i'm not able to bear all these people alone because it is too heavy for me and if thou deal thus with me kill me he started having suicidal thoughts just kill me i pray thee out of hand if i have found favor in thy sight and let me not see my righteousness i'm i'm getting to something here so let's go to number eight then they started complaining about moses leadership and myriad that's where miriam was cursed with leprosy you you ever think about all these things that that we're looking at here a lot they almost paralleled things that actually happened in brother brown's life there's a parallel for just about every one of these things in brother ramsey's life where men's pentecostal ministers would reject his teaching and just like they rejected moses and and and this in this case brother ram used the example of his wife how one day uh you know he came in the house and and she was dealing with some teenage problems with rebecca and she said she started telling them you're never here and you're never uh you know you you um i think now she didn't really say she didn't say something that you would think as being particularly harsh she just said you're never here to make decisions with me and brother brown said you're going to have to answer for that she said and you think about this from a spiritual perspective that god had a mandate just like or brother i'm at a mandate from god just like moses did to lead the people so he wasn't home a lot and he wasn't doing what a normal father would do because he was he was responsible for everything we're preaching everything we believe in this age and so she got a little bit frustrated with him just like just like and he compared it with with um miriam miriam thinking well you're you're not doing what i think you ought to do and she was what did it do it slowed the whole children of israel's walk for seven days so because she got leprosy and so it shut down everything it shut down their walk they couldn't go anywhere all of the children of israel got they they got stopped in their tracks because they had to wait for for seven days for miriam's leprosy to be cleansed this was the second time moses interceded for the people because he interceded he cried he began to cry out for miriam he said and it says healer now oh god i beseech thee and the lord said unto moses if her father had but spit in her face shall she not be ashamed seven days later be shut out from the from the camp seven days and after that let her be received in again and then they finally get to kadesh barnea where god had given them a promise that that uh they would be able to take the land what's the land the promise of the holy ghost the promise promise of the seven seals the promise of everything that the the promise of understanding the bible and the promise of overcoming your enemy promise of overcoming death all of those things are typed in this story here and all the congregation lifted their voice and cried and the people wept that night why because they they came back and said they're giants and and and and and the land eateth up the inhabitants thereof and everybody's big there's a lot of problems and all the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron and the whole congregation said unto them what would god that we had died in the land of egypt now now what what what are the giants there's a lot of giants giants bullies in the message giants are problems in your life giants what whatever the devil throws at you but god is more than able to deliver us out of every every giant that stands up in front of you it doesn't matter if you believe god's word and he and they said wherefore hath the lord brought us into this land to fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be a prey were it not better for us to return into egypt and they started looking back that a christian a real christian always looks forward like like those four uh beasts that the four messengers that brother hyatt was preaching about they always going forward never back that's what the holy ghost does in your life and you're always going forward and then if we go to the the tenth slide or the next slide number 10 they begin to say let's just vote out moses and we'll just get somebody else and they said to one another let us make a captain let us return into egypt and joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jefonna which were of them that searched the land rent their clothes but all the congregation made stone them with stones i think this is the strangest story that they were right there at at the crossing over and they got so upset with the men that were trying to say that we believed god's word that they were ready to kill them and this is the third time moses intercedes for the people now now you think i'm leading up to all these things joshua topping ministers no caleb type of believers moses typing ministers and and looking out on the people the children of israel and seeing people uh not believe and expecting a different reaction and getting getting frustrated and and moses having this problem with tempers and things and this whole story the whole story unfolding it paints a picture of a lot of frustrations and a lot of problems and so when you get problems and frustrations in your life you don't turn back like now like ministers now let's talk about ministers we don't we don't turn back if our if our message is not received in the way that we think it should be and i was telling brother luis a few a few weeks ago i said i'm going to put this slide in here so if we go to the next one just something to think about now i i found i was looking up all these stats and this is a stats about pastors but this let's just expand it on out to ministers that 75 percent of pastors report being extremely stressed or highly stressed and 90 work between 55 to 75 hours a week and 90 percent feel fatigued and worn out every what are you talking about brother i'm talking about brother moses at 40 percent report a serious conflict with a parishioner at least once a month 91 percent have experienced some for a form of burnout and ministry and 18 say they are fried to a crisp right now now now the reason i'm putting this in because because when you when you get in in trouble when you get to a troublesome spot and you get laid way down in the valley it's it's not time to turn back but it's time to buckle down i i reminded a lot of that story that in the bible where david he came to the camp and the philistines had taken all of his family and everything that he had taken all their wives and ran off with them and kidnapped everything and he said bring me the ephod because he knew in that moment of despair he was turning to the word of god so in the moment of your despair when it looks like things are going wrong and a lot of times it does it it's not time to do like moses and just throw down the tablets of stone after you come down and and got them from the it's not time to do like moses and just have a little temper tantrum but just rest rest upon god's word now the next slide 70 of pastors say they have a lower self-esteem now than when they enter ministry 70 constantly fight depression now see a lot of times you know we'll preach about the young people having depression but depression ain't just something for young people it's it's something when you you know you you feel like things aren't going the way that you expect like you think about all the effort that moses put into that all the effort and going down into egypt and and preaching his heart out for two people out of the original bunch for two people that's why he was he had some rough spots fifty percent feel so discouraged that they would leave their ministry if they could but can't find another job and listen i know from personal from from experience talking to pastors in in my past there's a lot that have had mental breakdowns and depression and things and people because i i talked to one that uh he said people call me in the middle of the night to pray for the fleas that their dog has and and i just want people to be able to to come to a place where they they know that they can lay their hands on their own dog and they just get to a place where you know they're constantly they get so discouraged and and uh 80 believe their pastoral ministry has negatively affected their families and 33 percent it was an outright hazard 80 percent of ministry spouses feel left out and unappreciated in their church and 77 percent feel they did not have a good marriage because because they go through things like brother branham when he got home and his his wife in that moment did not understand the calling that she was supposed to have in her life because when a man is called to serve the gospel so is his wife a man that's called to the priest the gospel his wife has to understand that when he's off studying a little bit then then he in that moment when he's got to preach a sermon he can't be mowing alone it's got you just you're called together to understand 80 of ministry spouses feel left out 77 feel they do not have a good marriage and 65 feel their family is in the glass house now let's go to the next slide what did brother brown say about this he said they got weary and the musicians should go ahead and come forward every time they get to a place where a showdown come and i see that goes for ministers and for the laity when you get to a place where there's a showdown don't get weary keep pressing on because we've got an anchor and i'll stop right there [Applause] you
