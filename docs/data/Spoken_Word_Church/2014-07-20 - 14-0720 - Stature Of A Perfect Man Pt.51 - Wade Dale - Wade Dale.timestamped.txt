[0:01] Jesus talking
[0:02] about the great commandment so let's
[0:06] read verse
[0:09] 34 but when the Pharisees had heard that
[0:11] he put the Sadducees to silence they
[0:13] were gathered together one of them which
[0:15] was a lawyer asked him a question
[0:17] tempting him say master which is the
[0:19] great commandment in the law Jesus said
[0:22] unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy
[0:24] God with all thy heart with all thy soul
[0:27] with all thy mind this is the first and
[0:29] great
[0:30] commandment now when you get into Mark
[0:32] we're going to read Mark Mark's going to
[0:34] give you a little bit different version
[0:35] but it's not different but what's the
[0:38] first
[0:39] commandment here you oh Israel your God
[0:42] is one all right and you can't love one
[0:46] if you think there's two or three so
[0:49] he's saying here Thou shalt love the
[0:51] Lord thy God not the Lords or one of the
[0:54] Lords right so he's saying one one God
[0:57] all right so one God is the greatest
[0:59] commandment is to know that he's
[1:01] one the second is like unto it Thou
[1:05] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on
[1:10] these two Commandments hang all the law
[1:13] and the prophets see how strong that is
[1:17] all
[1:17] right then they continue to ask him
[1:20] another question about what think you of
[1:22] Christ whose son is he but now let's go
[1:25] to Mark
[1:28] 12
[1:34] Mark
[1:36] 12 and 28 we going to get
[1:40] a another view what model app is that I
[1:46] like
[1:48] uh U version or you I'll show you in a
[1:53] minute Mark 12 now here's pretty much
[1:56] the same
[1:58] thing so same the same situation now
[2:01] here's Mark Writing and Jesus answered
[2:03] him the first of all the Commandments is
[2:05] here oh Israel the Lord our God is one
[2:07] God and thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[2:10] with all thy heart with all thy soul
[2:12] with all thy mind with all thy strength
[2:13] this is the first
[2:15] commandment and the second is like
[2:17] namely this Thou shalt love thy neighbor
[2:20] as thyself there is none other
[2:21] commandment greater than these so we've
[2:24] come up to brotherly kindness and I
[2:26] looked up the word commandment the word
[2:29] commandment means
[2:30] order a charge a precept or a prescribed
[2:36] rule that one must go by all right so
[2:40] Jesus is telling them not not taking the
[2:43] other eight Commandments away cuz you
[2:46] got the one there's all there's one with
[2:48] Pro the first one with promise which is
[2:50] what honor your father and mother that
[2:52] your days may be long on the face of the
[2:53] Earth that's the first commandment with
[2:55] promise right but the first one is L
[2:57] love the Lord your God with all your
[2:59] heart and all your your mind and then
[3:01] the second one Jesus brings in I don't
[3:03] think that's in the order if you'll look
[3:05] in Exodus you can I don't think the
[3:07] second one is that one the second one is
[3:09] another one and then you go down a
[3:10] little further but he brings all the
[3:12] Commandments together and brings two of
[3:14] them if you'll love the Lord your God
[3:16] and love your neighbor as
[3:17] yourself you won't kill him because it
[3:20] says Thou shalt not
[3:22] kill Thou shalt not steal you won't
[3:25] steal from your neighbor if you love him
[3:27] you understand so what Jesus is doing is
[3:29] he's taking all all these
[3:30] Commandments and he's taking them and
[3:32] saying hey if you'll get these two right
[3:34] the first time right you won't have to
[3:37] worry about the other eight the other
[3:39] eight will come in under those two and
[3:43] the same way with brotherly kindness
[3:44] brotherly kindness in the pyramid is
[3:46] right up there at the top but it's it's
[3:49] a culmination of all the faith virtue
[3:52] knowledge Temperance patience and
[3:53] godliness that we've been talking about
[3:55] it all culminates in that brotherly
[3:56] kindness cuz you you can't have
[3:58] brotherly kindness and not have
[4:00] Temperance that's right that's right
[4:04] some part of temperance you got to
[4:07] have definitely patience to have
[4:09] patience with your brother brother what
[4:11] he said have patience with your brother
[4:12] all right if you don't see the same
[4:14] thing you see all right let's go to
[4:16] second
[4:17] John or John
[4:20] 2 2 John 2 John
[4:25] 1 verse
[4:28] 4 and here's John I Rejoice greatly that
[4:31] I found of thy children Walking In Truth
[4:35] as we have received a commandment from
[4:37] the father and now I beseech thee lady
[4:40] so who she talking to not a woman
[4:42] sitting there she talking to the church
[4:44] and I beseech thee lady not as though I
[4:46] wrote a new commandment unto thee but
[4:49] that which we had from the beginning
[4:52] that we love one
[4:53] another and this love that we walk after
[4:57] his Commandments this is the Commandment
[4:59] that as you have heard from the
[5:01] beginning you should walk in it what he
[5:04] narrows it down to
[5:06] one that we love one
[5:10] another now watch what brother brandham
[5:14] says though brother Bram says you take
[5:16] Godly love which is agapa love which is
[5:20] unconditional and I heard a little I saw
[5:23] a little thing the other day and I think
[5:24] it's kind of cute and uh it's a joke but
[5:27] uh it's really not a joke but um this
[5:31] man gets to the Pearly Gates and I don't
[5:33] know why they got Peter at the ply gate
[5:35] I don't know why they got somebody
[5:36] standing at the ply Gates but anyway all
[5:38] the stories come up with Peter standing
[5:40] at the at the perly Gat I guess Peter's
[5:43] a pretty rough character so they got him
[5:44] standing there weeding them out I guess
[5:46] he's got the KE ke he's got the Keys of
[5:48] the Kingdom that's good all right so
[5:51] he's got the key to the gate so he walks
[5:53] in so this guy walks up and St Peter
[5:56] says oh wait a minute we've changed
[5:58] things you got we're on a point system
[6:00] now you got to have 200 points before
[6:03] you can enter Heaven and it's got to be
[6:07] it's got to be what you've done on Earth
[6:10] yeah and the guy said well the greatest
[6:13] thing I know I've done I've been married
[6:14] for 50 I'm married 50 years never
[6:16] committed adultery never done anything
[6:18] against my wife we had a wonderful
[6:19] marriage St Peter said well that's good
[6:22] that's worth two points you got said two
[6:26] points so he says well what else did you
[6:29] do said well I you know built a building
[6:31] for the homeless or something you know
[6:32] he said well that's good for one point
[6:34] and he went through a bunch of things
[6:35] didn't have about Five Points built up
[6:37] and he everything he done in his life
[6:39] you know he said he said well how am I
[6:42] going to make it said only by the grace
[6:44] of God can I make it and Peter said
[6:45] there's your 200
[6:48] points there's your 200 points in or in
[6:51] he finally got him down to where it was
[6:52] by the grace of God he made it in not by
[6:54] what he done down here so that's the
[6:56] same thing here but still they're
[6:58] connected they're still connected you
[7:00] still got to love you still got to do
[7:02] the Commandments of
[7:05] God oh that guy was on do and don't he
[7:07] was on I didn't do this I did do this I
[7:09] did this but the grace of
[7:12] God listen it's only by the grace of God
[7:15] my point is is that we can love each
[7:17] other that's right it's only by the
[7:19] grace of God that we can love somebody
[7:20] that actually hates you right that's
[7:24] right I mean actually it's easy for it's
[7:26] easy for somebody to love you that loves
[7:28] you that's right but for somebody that
[7:30] just absolutely Gres your
[7:32] chees you
[7:34] know I
[7:35] mean that little baby had a jubilee
[7:38] yesterday she finally got out amongst
[7:40] Brethren and sisters and she was
[7:42] shouting and praising the Lord and
[7:45] laughing and jumping up and down she was
[7:46] having a good time it was good to having
[7:48] her at fellowship meeting but look at
[7:50] second
[7:52] John and this is love that we walk after
[7:54] his Commandments this is the Commandment
[7:56] that as you have heard from the
[7:57] beginning you should walk in it that's
[7:58] the love
[7:59] one another for many deceivers are enter
[8:02] into the world who confess not that
[8:04] Jesus Christ is come in the flesh this
[8:05] is the deceiver and Antichrist look to
[8:07] yourselves that we lose not those things
[8:10] which we have wrought but that re we
[8:12] receive a full reward so it's culminated
[8:16] in a reward and we do get a reward and I
[8:19] was thinking the other day and I think
[8:20] I'm going to maybe do a a message on it
[8:23] or something maybe not down here but
[8:26] upstairs
[8:28] Moses
[8:30] Abraham remember it started he started
[8:32] as
[8:33] Abram right he started as Abram there
[8:36] was things went on with Abram that were
[8:39] right right remember he he walked with
[8:42] God he he done the things even as Abram
[8:46] but when he become Abraham other things
[8:49] came into view it wasn't Abram anymore
[8:51] it was Abraham and there was more things
[8:54] what I'm saying is we got a lot of
[8:58] Abrams
[9:00] that can produce something but it's a
[9:01] wild
[9:03] child It produced a promise but it
[9:05] wasn't the promise God was talking about
[9:08] so we got a lot of Abrams and even when
[9:11] you're born again I believe you're an
[9:12] Abram you get up you walk with God hey
[9:15] Abram's Journey was justification
[9:17] sanctification into the baptism of the
[9:20] Holy Ghost right that was
[9:22] Abram right that was Abram wasn't
[9:25] Abraham it was Abram and he produced a
[9:28] child during that time he produced a lot
[9:31] of things he even met
[9:33] MDC when he was Abram he met MDC so you
[9:36] got to do the same thing and that
[9:38] journey of justification sanctification
[9:39] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost has
[9:41] been preached and preached but I want to
[9:43] take it more as a level of of us already
[9:45] in the message there's a lot of Abrams
[9:47] that's just going to produce a wild
[9:48] child but you know what he's going to
[9:50] walk with God cuz Abram walked with
[9:54] God watch read your Bible Abram walked
[9:56] with God Abram was not some wild
[10:00] you know camel Chaser or whatever they
[10:03] did back then he he wasn't that even in
[10:07] his justification he walked with God
[10:10] right so remember how we teach it here
[10:12] you you go through justification
[10:14] sanctification baptism the holy ghost in
[10:15] a baby form and then when you get in the
[10:17] pyramid what we're talking about now is
[10:19] right back to justification
[10:22] again right right then you're going to
[10:24] realize when we get to the Capstone
[10:26] there's another justification that that
[10:28] person really didn't do it that's where
[10:29] you got to realize that you didn't do it
[10:32] in the first place right you're
[10:34] Justified Justified means you didn't do
[10:36] it well now when you get born again you
[10:38] know you did it cuz it's real fresh on
[10:40] your mind then when you go through the
[10:42] statue of a perfect man it begins to
[10:44] weed out those things that you did and
[10:47] that you're still doing remember the
[10:49] sister's dream the trash was coming out
[10:52] the water was going
[10:54] in and then brother Brown talks about
[10:56] honey lying in the Box
[11:00] okay so we got Journey the journey we
[11:02] got a journey inside of a journey that's
[11:04] right right we do we have a journey
[11:07] inside of a journey our journey as a
[11:09] Christian as a even as a nominal
[11:12] Christian there's a journey that's right
[11:14] it's like brother John La Fontaine was
[11:16] was preaching yesterday which was
[11:19] wonderful brother Brown said there'll be
[11:21] a lot of
[11:23] people and I just read the quote not too
[11:25] long ago there'll be a lot of people in
[11:27] the tribulation because you didn't
[11:30] present the gospel to him your fault
[11:34] said that's what he said he said brother
[11:36] random said that yeah I just read it
[11:37] it's a quote I just read it the other
[11:39] day it's a direct quote he read it out
[11:42] of Revelation chapter 3 cuz that's what
[11:44] I was reading the other day and he said
[11:45] because of you and me he said you and me
[11:49] he said many will go through the
[11:51] tribulation cuz we didn't present the
[11:53] gospel to them you know what that means
[11:56] to me if we' have presented it to them
[11:58] they would have accepted it
[12:00] so how many times do we pass by our
[12:02] neighbor because we don't like our
[12:04] neighbor and I ain't talking about the
[12:05] guy that lives right beside of you right
[12:08] okay I'm talking about your community
[12:10] even here or even another church or or
[12:12] witnessing to people but remember cuz
[12:15] our life speaks louder than our words
[12:16] anytime okay so you have to look and see
[12:19] that that there's a journey inside of a
[12:22] journey though once you come into the
[12:24] message of the hour there's a journey
[12:26] there's a journey of a Christian We Must
[12:27] Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ Christ
[12:29] we must be justified Sanctified filled
[12:31] with the Holy Ghost but
[12:34] remember let me just give you a little
[12:36] key Abram's
[12:38] Journey listen to me Abram's Journey was
[12:41] from 47 to
[12:48] 63 think about that a little bit Abram's
[12:51] Journey was from 47 to 63 brother
[12:54] Brown's message from 47 to 1963 that was
[12:58] Abram's message message It produced not
[13:01] and it did it produced Pentecostal It
[13:02] produced a wild child speaking in tongu
[13:05] shouting it brought the it brought
[13:07] justification and sanctification back in
[13:09] order remember that was a restoration
[13:11] everybody got that you got it then
[13:14] Abraham's
[13:16] Journey Abraham's Journey was for one
[13:19] thing and one thing only and that's what
[13:20] I'm going to speak on we have a mandate
[13:23] from God a commandment to be Abraham
[13:26] because Abraham is the only one that got
[13:28] a body change
[13:30] Abram's body wasn't changed Abraham's
[13:33] body was changed Abraham had to meet
[13:35] mezd in a different way than he met him
[13:39] in his other in his journey of a
[13:40] Christian Life you understand what I'm
[13:42] saying yes if you don't then I'll give
[13:44] you an hour or
[13:46] so teach the seals in
[13:49] 63 yes so 63 is when
[13:53] mzc the son of man that was God in human
[13:57] flesh that's that's when he came when
[14:01] sunset Mountain I believe opened the
[14:03] seals to the prophet well there was
[14:06] Abraham that was the start of Abraham's
[14:09] Journey right everybody get so you
[14:12] understand what I'm saying yes so we
[14:14] don't take Abram and Abraham as being
[14:16] from denominational World up we got to
[14:18] come and bring it to us right that that
[14:21] message from 47 to 63 did not produce a
[14:26] Rapture it just and I don't mean just as
[14:29] in being belittling it but it brought us
[14:32] back to a place to where we could become
[14:34] Abraham Abram's Journey brought him to
[14:38] where he could become Abraham okay
[14:40] everybody got that if Abram was if Abram
[14:44] wasn't
[14:45] right even in his folly and all the
[14:47] things he did wrong if he wasn't right
[14:50] he would have never met MDC on that
[14:55] road right right Abram said my Lord one
[15:01] God there's your first
[15:04] commandment now what's the next thing at
[15:06] I'm going to preach a sermon here what's
[15:08] the next thing Abraham
[15:11] said to
[15:14] MDC can you find 10 of my
[15:18] brothers righteous well he started with
[15:20] 50 that's right right so he thought
[15:24] about his Brethren there's your two
[15:26] Commandments there you go that's right
[15:28] that's good well
[15:30] Hallelujah y'all can sleep or not show
[15:32] up when Daddy asked me to preach cuz
[15:33] that's what probably I'll preach on but
[15:36] Abraham first thing he was worried about
[15:40] was his neighbor that's right that's
[15:42] right that's right he said God can you
[15:44] find and God said hey if I can find 50
[15:46] righteous I'll save all of Sodom Abra
[15:49] Abraham he finally said man I don't know
[15:50] if we can get 50 he said how about 10 he
[15:53] said if I can find 10 I'll spare it but
[15:56] remember he couldn't but what was
[15:57] Abraham in in that part of his journey
[16:00] when he met MDC and he was solidified
[16:03] knowing that Sarah was going to be one
[16:05] that produced the child and that he was
[16:07] going to have that child now first thing
[16:09] he thought about was his brothers his
[16:11] brother his what lot wasn't his brother
[16:13] but he was his cousin or whatever nephew
[16:15] that was his neighbor that was his
[16:17] fellow brother that's what I was
[16:19] thinking about last night when brother
[16:20] John was preaching on on lot because
[16:24] remember lot lot was
[16:26] righteous the Bible said that that the
[16:29] sins of Sodom vexed his righteous Soul
[16:32] now if the Bible's wrong the Bible's
[16:34] wrong it's not brother Bram said he was
[16:36] a type of what the denominational
[16:38] believer that live close to the
[16:41] world right right but what's the first
[16:43] thing when AB I think about that last
[16:45] night what's the first first thing when
[16:47] Abraham and mzc was together and
[16:50] everything comes together and mezic says
[16:53] your commission is to have the child and
[16:55] you know what Abraham I believe he said
[16:58] well God you're going to have to change
[16:59] me back now he may not have said that
[17:00] verbally but in his mind he thought I
[17:02] can't produce it like I am so God's
[17:05] going to have to do something God had to
[17:07] come in 63 and break the seals to the
[17:09] prophet to break the Redemption of the
[17:11] body to give us a body chain but the
[17:14] first
[17:16] thing when Abraham became who he
[17:19] was he said oh that you could save my
[17:22] neighbor there's your first two
[17:25] Commandments right there because
[17:27] remember I'll read you a quote
[17:28] when we do this brother Brown said every
[17:31] son of the faith in the end will have to
[17:34] go through the same Journey as
[17:38] Abraham at the final end this is us
[17:40] every son of the faith has to go through
[17:42] the final Journey just like Abraham went
[17:45] through so Abraham is definitely a type
[17:47] of our justification sanctification
[17:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost in the to be
[17:51] born again right but remember you and
[17:55] faith I mean his faith faith going
[17:57] that's where it started
[17:59] I'm just saying change you know yes well
[18:02] it started with faith to get born again
[18:05] and that same faith is going to change
[18:06] your body it's not a different Faith
[18:08] it's just more of the same Faith right
[18:10] all right because what what MDC did when
[18:13] when brother R brought those seals it
[18:15] brought an ability for us to take a body
[18:19] change there was no way we could do it
[18:21] until 63 even brother Bram thought he
[18:24] preached everything remember the spoken
[18:25] words being on seed he said Billy Graham
[18:27] s a seed or Robert S a seed and I've sld
[18:29] a
[18:30] seed where's the crop of it in other
[18:32] words I'm paraphrasing where's the crop
[18:34] of it holy spirit said pick up a pen and
[18:36] write brother Ram thought Malachi 4 had
[18:38] already been fulfilled but the Holy
[18:40] Spirit told him said as of yet Malachi 4
[18:44] has not been fulfilled in other words
[18:46] you thought you might have preached the
[18:47] seals back in the 50s which you did in
[18:49] one service remember but now you got a
[18:52] commission you got a mandate because
[18:54] I've got a group of
[18:57] people that's going to bring that
[18:59] promised son that's why there in Psalms
[19:01] it's real fitting that we read that
[19:02] about bringing the son of man on the
[19:03] scene cuz that's the word made flesh
[19:06] that's not a
[19:08] Spirit come on people we're not dealing
[19:10] with it we had the Son of God the spirit
[19:12] down through the church ages we're out
[19:14] of the church ages that's right so the
[19:17] son of man's got to be the word and
[19:18] flesh in us that's right it was a word
[19:21] and flesh in in in Mar I mean in um
[19:24] Martin and Luther and all those people
[19:25] but it wasn't the fullness they didn't
[19:28] know how to get virtue knowledge
[19:30] Temperance patience godliness it took a
[19:31] prophet to bring that together to build
[19:33] remember what zerubabel did because of
[19:36] zerubabel is a type of brother brandom
[19:39] zerubabel what' he do he swept off the
[19:42] foundation and built the building now
[19:45] that's what brother rown had to do he
[19:46] had to sweep off TI up the Loose Ends to
[19:49] build this great building the statue of
[19:50] a perfect man all right so it's all
[19:52] through the Bible I the people that
[19:54] don't get it I guess they just like
[19:56] brother John said they just ain't going
[19:57] to get it
[19:59] but
[20:00] uh if you'll see these two
[20:04] Commandments they do sum up everything
[20:07] cuz if you get one God right you got the
[20:08] Bible right okay you've got your new
[20:10] birth right you've got where you can
[20:13] talk about God being your father and not
[20:16] having a father and then a son and a
[20:18] holy ghost somewhere else you know you
[20:20] you you've come to the you come to the
[20:23] to the knowledge that there's nobody
[20:24] between you sure there's a man in Christ
[20:26] Jesus but he's God he's the father made
[20:28] manifest in the form of a
[20:30] son then you got the second commandment
[20:33] which we all got to come
[20:35] to now Abraham knew what was going on in
[20:39] Sodom right they were sodomites amen you
[20:43] know what sodomites do and they are
[20:45] they're they're they're they pretty viol
[20:48] but and men and men women and women
[20:50] where all that came from where that
[20:51] devil came
[20:53] from and lot sitting down there in the
[20:55] middle of
[20:56] it the two angels went
[20:59] down and they even tried to get the two
[21:01] angels out and and mess with them so
[21:04] that's pretty vile that's right but for
[21:06] Abraham to once he realized that the
[21:09] promise had come to him see AB Abram's
[21:13] Journey brought him up to a certain
[21:15] place and now he had a revelation that
[21:18] he's Abraham a father of many
[21:21] nations so there's Isaac is going to
[21:24] come so second thing he does first thing
[21:26] he does he says my Lord he knows there's
[21:28] one God then he looks down in s him and
[21:31] says well how about my neighbor can you
[21:32] save my neighbor see that's what we
[21:35] should do that's the Brotherly Love
[21:36] brotherly kindness that we should be
[21:38] talking about now let's go to
[21:40] Revelations
[21:46] 14
[21:57] 12
[21:58] here is the patience of the Saints here
[22:01] are they that keep the Commandments of
[22:02] God in the faith of Jesus Christ see I
[22:04] brought them all together now we know
[22:06] that a lot of this is talking about
[22:08] Israel but remember in in type it's us
[22:11] right in type it's us here's the
[22:13] patience of the Saints here are they
[22:16] that keep the
[22:17] commandments so that's us we must keep
[22:20] the Ten
[22:22] Commandments amen we're the only people
[22:24] that can keep the Ten Commandments but
[22:27] if you'll not try to keep them in a list
[22:30] you'll do a lot better just take the
[22:32] first two that Jesus talked about you
[22:34] know Jesus didn't run through all the
[22:35] Commandments not at one
[22:37] time he he'd pick one or two here and
[22:40] there but he said the greatest of the
[22:41] greatest of The Commandments are these
[22:42] two so if Jesus said the greatest of The
[22:45] Commandments are these two then that's
[22:46] the two that we got to overcome
[22:48] by believe in one God and love your
[22:51] neighbors you love yourself and love
[22:53] each other okay so let's go to
[22:55] Revelations
[22:56] 22
[23:03] 14 I like this program but the only
[23:06] thing I don't like about it is is you
[23:07] can't like cut and paste and put it in a
[23:10] sermon form you have to do it by the
[23:11] folio views I wish you could do it with
[23:13] this but if you do I don't know how to
[23:16] do it so but I like it because it's real
[23:19] quick you can get where you're going and
[23:21] you do have little things over there
[23:23] that you can play with but I haven't
[23:24] played with them yet it's just good to
[23:26] read scripture with
[23:28] and it's got a lot of different versions
[23:30] let's see got American Standard Version
[23:33] it's got good news translation the book
[23:35] of the Bible New Testament new
[23:36] international Readers got a bunch it's
[23:38] like 40 different versions that you can
[23:40] read if you want to I like King James
[23:42] but you can read other versions to get
[23:44] what it says but Revelations 22:14 Watch
[23:47] what it says blessed are they that do
[23:49] his Commandments that they may have
[23:51] right to the tree of life and may enter
[23:53] in through the gates into the
[23:55] city blessed are they that do his his
[23:58] Commandments his statutes his order his
[24:00] charge his precept his prescribed Rule
[24:04] now remember it's not do and don't it's
[24:06] not dos and don'ts just like I told you
[24:08] about the man that goes to heaven it's
[24:09] not the paving of the parking lot or
[24:13] right or you know giving the you know
[24:16] you know giving the pastor something or
[24:18] giving me something or giving you each
[24:19] other something that's right that to me
[24:22] should be a it should be number one
[24:26] without strength attached
[24:28] you going to give somebody something
[24:29] give it to them it don't matter what
[24:30] they give you back you know what the
[24:32] Bible saying it don't matter it don't
[24:34] matter what the person you know well
[24:36] well I got a Christmas gift but you you
[24:37] didn't give him one you didn't give me
[24:39] you give me one but you didn't give him
[24:40] one or you didn't give you one give me
[24:42] one well I a give you one I ain't going
[24:43] to give you one okay I told her I give
[24:45] her the same thing I got her last
[24:48] year I may leave it the same
[24:52] color
[24:54] but it must be because remember agape
[24:58] love is unconditional love feel your
[25:02] love whatever you want to say about it
[25:04] it is
[25:07] conditional one more time F your love is
[25:12] conditional am all right huh if your
[25:17] husband does something good you love him
[25:19] a little more if he does bad you don't
[25:21] talk to him for three or four days
[25:23] that's conditional now that's not
[25:26] Jesus
[25:28] actually Jesus will talk to you when
[25:30] you're mad at him you know right so
[25:34] remember brother Bown explained it so
[25:36] well he said here's a goly love which we
[25:37] really can't understand cuz remember
[25:40] it's a pieace that passes all
[25:42] understanding so it's something we can't
[25:43] understand but remember if you get up
[25:45] that statute of a perfect man you going
[25:47] to understand it better than you did
[25:48] when you was a baby that's right amen so
[25:51] you come to brotherly kindness you're
[25:52] getting brother B say remember says
[25:54] you're now getting close to the kingdom
[25:56] that's right why the kingdom is the
[25:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit
[25:59] the fullness of God not just the new
[26:01] birth that you received everybody
[26:03] understand that cuz we're going to talk
[26:04] about that where it says holy spirit
[26:06] right there okay that's not where you
[26:08] receive the new birth that don't say New
[26:10] Birth that says holy spirit you receive
[26:13] the New Birth the baptism of the Holy
[26:16] Spirit down there at Faith all right but
[26:19] up there at the top that was that honey
[26:21] that sealed everything
[26:22] in at the top you got to be sealed in
[26:26] and Satan sealed out because when you
[26:28] going through your
[26:29] journey honest to goodness Satan lives
[26:33] with you a lot more than God
[26:36] does in Hebrews we were told to read
[26:39] Hebrews and where it says without faith
[26:41] you can't please God and my faith is I'm
[26:45] not quite there with the change I mean
[26:48] it's weak um but where it says without
[26:52] faith is that talking about the faith in
[26:53] the New
[26:54] Birth you think yes because well without
[26:57] faith birth yes without faith it's
[26:59] impossible to please God you can't
[27:01] please God without having a new
[27:04] birth got to have the Holy Ghost so yeah
[27:06] that Faith but remember too you got to
[27:09] jump on up there and without that Holy
[27:11] Spirit without that Faith that's right
[27:14] it's impossible to please God in his
[27:16] fullness that's right in his fullness
[27:19] right you please God remember he said I
[27:22] am pleased to dwell in you right here at
[27:24] Faith just like he did Jesus on the
[27:26] River Jordan he said this is my beloved
[27:27] Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell not
[27:30] hear ye him but now when he comes to
[27:33] mount
[27:35] Transfiguration he says Hear You him
[27:37] brother Bram was an adopted son of God
[27:40] he had the mind of
[27:42] Christ
[27:44] amen more than anybody besides Jesus
[27:47] Christ on the face of the Earth amen so
[27:49] he was an adopted son of God then God
[27:52] said hear ye him in 1963 that's what
[27:54] happened when that sword came in his
[27:56] hand when he he met God out there met
[27:58] those angels I don't care what they got
[28:00] to say about it that was very
[28:02] important and it happened but he had a
[28:05] sword in the hand and he said that is
[28:06] the sword of the king that's the word
[28:09] all right so what he had to do he had to
[28:11] meet God in his fullness to bring us to
[28:14] a Rapture cuz we can't get in rapturing
[28:17] condition as Abram we mess up we produce
[28:20] a wild child we didn't produce a child
[28:23] but it was a wild child you and I we're
[28:25] wild we're we're the wild we we remember
[28:27] we were grafted in we were the Wild
[28:29] Olive
[28:30] Tree right that's Gentiles we were
[28:33] grafted in as the Wild Olive
[28:36] Tree so we've always been the wild child
[28:39] but God saw so much in us that we knew
[28:42] if he could get inside our soul he knew
[28:44] if he could meet Abraham one more Abram
[28:46] one more time he'd change him cuz his
[28:50] change started when he called him
[28:52] Abraham that's when his chain started
[28:55] when God gave you the new birth he
[28:58] started your change but now remember it
[29:01] he didn't say hear ye him until later
[29:06] on because remember as Abram Abram could
[29:10] not have taken his child on the mountain
[29:14] and done what he
[29:15] did I'm telling you he couldn't do
[29:19] it but as Abraham he walks up and
[29:23] prophesies hear ye him because Abraham
[29:26] said the boy and I will go and the boy
[29:30] and I will
[29:32] return now he was telling he was
[29:35] standing so God said hey I heard my son
[29:38] and whatever he says that's what's going
[29:41] to happen that's why you turn fear to
[29:44] Faith in Abram there was a lot of
[29:48] fear remember God put him to sleep he
[29:50] feared his death he feared hell he
[29:52] feared these things when you come up to
[29:54] Abraham let me tell you something when
[29:57] you meet
[29:58] God brother around so we got to meet him
[30:01] when you meet God which is God in human
[30:03] flesh which is US Pastor preacher
[30:06] evangelist all the five full ministry
[30:08] for the perfecting of the Saints once
[30:11] you meet that it changes
[30:14] you and your faith builds more because
[30:18] Abraham
