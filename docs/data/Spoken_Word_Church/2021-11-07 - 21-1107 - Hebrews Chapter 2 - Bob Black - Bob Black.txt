========================================

bless you thanks good to be in the house of the lord we had a good time at bible study last night so let's let's study some more bible we're going through hebrews we got we made it to hebrews chapter two last last sunday so let's keep going through through that um if the brothers can pull that up we'll just read through again real quick just to set the context and paul said in hebrews chapter two therefore we ought to give the more earnest he to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for the word spoken by angels was steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him god also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with divers miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will for unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come wherever we speak but one in a certain place testified saying what is man that thou art mindful of him but the son of man that thou visited him thou madest him a little lower than the angels thou crowned him with glory and honor and to set him over the works of thy hands that was put all things and subjection under his feet and friend that he put all and subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him but now we see not yet all things put under him but we see jesus on the next slide now there's there's your a good evidence that something's happened when you see jesus but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of god should take death for every man for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons into glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren saying i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will i sing praise unto thee and again i will put my trust in him and again behold i and the children which god has given me for as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and on the next slide and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetimes subject to bondage for verily he took not only the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of abraham wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to god to make reconciliation for the sins of the people for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted he is able to sucker them that are tempted on the next slide we'll just kind of do a little quick background of of verse one where it says therefore we ought to give the more earnest he to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip and brother branham kind of outlined we all we ought to be to we shouldn't let we've heard so many things so let's let's not let these things slip it's so easy to to just uh take for granted the things we've heard and and and uh and not not busy ourselves not make ourselves lively stones with the word that we've heard so we said we ought to be busy every minute trying to get people to christ we ought to be concerned we ought to be lively stones songs we should never be slothful like we are and that that quote i read last sunday that kind of got a reaction we'll go up to church and we'll see the lord jesus do something or bless us in such a way and then we'll go back out and say very nice meeting in other words it would just kind of it kind of it doesn't it doesn't really uh stick that something's taking place in our life we begin to just kind of take it for granted the the word that god has given to us in this age now the next slide uh and brother i'm also sitting and then we see those things take place that we do see take place enough we should never let these things slip we just let it go through our fingers that's what's the matter with the great pentecostal church today they let the very cream of the crop slipped through their fingers when they had it in their hand had wood in their hands had the very the the full revelation of the bible in in their hands and they they just let us they didn't recognize what it was i i wonder are we recognizing what we've got in our in our grasp that the things that have been probed at over the years now we've got the full revelation we've got access we've got access to what paul said are the way of escape we've got access to a way to get out of here a way to get out of our ideas and and and to get out of the bondage that the devil has put us in to to get out of the fear of death um and he said look what they've done they've done like the rest of the churches they run in the game in the way of korra and perished in the way of cain and perished in the gang saying of cora now on the next slide brother ram goes on to talk about don't don't let things slip and one way you can let things slip is when you begin to get in your mind there's always going to be divisions amongst people people have different ideas and when you get them out around people somebody somebody's not going to see predestination the way that you do or the statue of perfect man or or what the new birth really is but not not to let not not ever see he's saying don't don't get dis-unified but let's the way that you can help one another out is is to go out to lunch with somebody and talk to talk about things the way that you can help one another out is to share things and and to not not dis fellowship but to actually you know like jesus he would he would uh and he got a lot of slack flack for it would he would go out and fellowship with sinners and republicans and and uh prostitutes and you know the woman the woman at the well standing there fellowship with her even though you know you look at that situation why why are you talking to that to those people and so brother brown said how did the indians lose this country to the white man they were fighting one among each other they would have held their grounds if they had all come together how are we going to lose it because we're disunified how we lose our experience with god is because we disunify we should never be divided we might differ in ideas but let's be heart and heart brother now there's when you really know that you you're loving one another when you when you disagree about something but you can sit down and and eat and eat bread and talk about things and that's one of the hardest things for people to do is actually listen to one another so many times we want to we want to sit across the table and we want we're so quick to to think of the next thing that we can clock somebody over the head with instead of actually listening sometimes if we listen to one another we'll find out that maybe we're closer to one another than we really that we really thought we were we might different ideas but let's be heart and heart brothers god wants us to be he died for the entire church of god and we do not want to be disunified now one example of that i put over there to the side is in mark chapter nine you know before they before the disciples got the new birth they they had a lot of they had a lot of problems they were wanting to see who was the biggest and wanting to see who was the greatest and that's that's a quick way to be dis-unified is when you're fighting over who the biggest can be and john said john answered john john the beloved put his head on jesus's breast john said that what a surprise john the one that you know everybody's looking he's the the one that everybody said love john typed love and everything he said master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and he followed without us and we forbade him because he followeth not us in other words he's not part of our little group here he's not group so we we said you not even why are you casting out devils if you're not in our little group but jesus said forbid him not for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil of me for he that is not against us is on our part so don't let things slip by letting that's how the devil the devil will get in you and try to in an assembly and try to try to tear things apart by by using little division using little things that that are different differences among us to try to split us apart so that's what brother brown talks about on the next slide he said there's some little things stars now now remember we're we're talking about hebrews 2 1 unless that any time we should let them slip these they let these truths slip so brother ram said there's some little things stars and from there it begins to roll that's the same thing starts in a church a little tattle starts in the church i i don't think that some brother is preaching it the right way i think he's i think he really believes it this way or i i you know what i don't think that person is living right or whatever starts a little something something goes out a little tattle starts in the church and it rolls up into a place that'll break the church up and separate it that's what broke up the pentecostal group that's what makes them about 20 or 30 different organizations that's what broke up the lutherans and now we're 900 and something different organizations of all the protestant churches is it because some little something started we should not be divided we should be one church one brethren one brotherhood standing shoulder to shoulder in these days now that doesn't mean we don't stand for the truth that we don't we don't stand for what we believe in but if there's a little division right you don't immediately you don't just throw somebody out just because there's difference and in matthew 18 it says jesus jesus said who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them and said verily i say unto you accept you be converted and become his little children you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven a little child the child just wants to be taught just wants to tell me what to do and he's not concerned on the playground about who's big and who's little they're just there to have fun we're just you'd be as a little child you just come to church and you just if you want to be be a real christian just come to church and enjoy the fellowship of the lord and not try to be big he said whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same as greatest in the kingdom of heaven and we know these things but it's good to rehearse and rehash a little bit sometimes and on the next slide brother brown said so paul said for if the word spoken by angels was steadfast now here's where we we talked when we were going through hebrews chapter one we talked about what angels were and this is where brother brown really rehashes it again when he preached the message hebrews chapter two what is the name what's paul talking about an angel he said now angel is the messenger the word angel means messenger and just got through in the first book here god in sundry times in diverse manner a lot of different ways a lot of different times spoke to the fathers by the prophets that was god's messengers the prophets was god's angels they were god's angels now these are brother rams words they were god's angels so that's who that's who paul is talking about for if the word spoken by angels was steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recommended for reward how shall we escape a messenger is an angel or an angel is the messenger rather and on the next slide he said you're a messenger this morning you've got in other words you've got a message of the good news you got something to carry to your family to your work when when somebody's down harder that you work you've got something positive to share with them because you're a messenger you've got something little mama's in the kitchen making bread or whatever doing you got you got a message for your kids that you can be a preacher to your family and tell them tell your kids how to be born again or whatever he said you're a messenger this morning you're a messenger of good news or a messenger of bad news oh isn't it beautiful to know that we are ambassadors that we are angels the messengers of the resurrection and we are god's messengers to the sinful world that christ lives in our hearts he lives in our spirits he lives now that's that's that's the gospel message is that he's alive he's not laying in the grave he's not laying up in the grave up there in jeffersonville brother branham he's alive today and and we'll get into that a little bit more as as paul carries on in this chapter that he's alive that's that's a that's a that's the evidence that's the evidence in you that something's happened is he's alive his nature is there now on the next on the next slide he said forth the word spoken by angels was steadfast steadfast means it's something that you can have confidence in and he said their word was steadfast in the old testament if the word spoken by angels were steadfast that he said that way it had to be right in other words you can't you know when a minister gets somebody behind the pulpit it would be a whole lot easier if you could just say whatever popped into your head but we've got to have something steadfast we've got to have something that you can compare back to the word so you in the old testament they have the urim and thumb that they would they would they would stand before and say say a prophecy or say something that to compare back against something the light would flash across that urem thumb in the new testament the urem thumb is the word so everything has got to compare back to the word it would be it would be nice if we could just say well i had i had a vision or i had a dream about something or i know what the interpretation of the dream is or whatever but you've got to take everything back to the word because that's what steadfast is brother i said in the old testament before words god prophet's word could be made manifest it had to be examined and proved it's got to be examined and proved it wasn't loose with it like we are today just go out and have any kind of a sensation or anything or any kind of a sensation see i felt something or i i saw something or i saw a light come down that's that's great and we believe in the power of god we believe in god doing things but you got to take it back to the word he said oh glory to god that's it you're mistaken if you just look if you base everything on a sensation or see and see a light or something or anything like that that's great the bible said that in the last days the devil will impersonate christianity so close to little deceived the very elected if possible that's right so we must test it and how do we test it by the word you got to test it by going back to the word everything has to be compared back to the word your experience has to be compared back to the word your your new birth has to be compared with the word your journey has to be compared with a word everything has got to be compared with a word we don't believe in just something popping into your head and just running with it we believe in comparing everything back to the word so if we've got if we've got a word that can be compare a message in this day that can be compared back to the word how shall we escaped if we if we neglect so great salvation if we go to the next slide how should we escape and so what is our escape brother abraham said how should we escape if elijah's voice brought destruction because he was an angel of the lord how will we escape when the voice of christ speaking through or how can we fail when you're prayed for if it's the voice of christ and he said where is your escape he said you say bless god i belong to the methodist church i'm a presbyterian i'm a pentecostal that doesn't have one thing to do with it you get on a sideline i want to call it spiritualism or some mental telepathy or some devil or something to shame on them and when we see him come down to confirm his word how shall we escape if we sucker to some church or some organization or denomination or some little pet theory of our own so their way of escape is not in our own ideas or in our little little clicks ideas denominational ideas but it's the revealed word for your day he said you better eternally turn the loose of what turn loose of your own ideas of your own way of thinking for every sin received a just recompense under the angels how much more when the son of god is speaking from the heavens to make manifest his word how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation what what what what kind of a salvation is it salvation where we know that christ died on the cross for us that he paid for our sins they made a way for us to be born again that he made a way for us to have the same life of christ in us how should we escape if we neglect a salvation like that you know on the next slide brother graham said there's where all the types and shadows of the old testament all come and met in jesus christ he paid the supreme price ascended on high and sent back the holy ghost tonight which is god's provided way of your escape the way for you to get out the way of escape is the life of god god coming and taking taking a seat on the throne of your heart now when he when he does that when he takes the seat on the throne of your heart he bears witness that's how you know something's happened so paul says in hebrews 2 4 god also bearing them witness and listen to how brother branham you you you're reading this and you've got your mind on the old testament that that god moved through the life of elijah and elisha and all the old testament prophets but now brother brown brings it home that something's got to happen in your life he said god also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will now see he says god always bears witness god always has a way to show that something has taken place and he said your life will bear witness your life bears witness i'm gonna read this real slow i don't know what your testimony is but your life speaks so loud your voice can't be heard now see it's it's it's great we need a revelation of the word but the revelation of the word will produce a life and you know i was thinking this morning coming up uh all right you gotta be careful not to say too much but um you know you see you see things on facebook and and people that people that you thought were christians and things for years and and you know brother brown said things like this people you look at their lives and for years and all of a sudden things come out and they got a woman on the side or something or they're ministers that aren't living right and things your life your life testifies it's a it actually bears witness and how many how many of you sitting here let's use that for an example how many of you sitting here as i speak these words or the brother wade comes out if if you were to look at the minister speaking behind the pool but if you look at their life and recognize that find out that they're cheating on their wife or something or they got something going on in their life they're they're they're sneaking off somewhere to smoke pot or sneaking off and smoking cigarettes then you would begin to lose confidence in that person because their life bears testimony that something is not right your life speaks louder actually than the words that you speak and see i can get up here and i can say things and but but then if i go out and i do something different than the message that i'm preaching my life will actually speak louder than that and he said that's why he said i don't know what your testimony is but your life speaks so loud your voice can't be heard but you're living your everyday life will testify what you are god bears witness now now think about that now talk about think about a witness where the life speaks so loud that your spouse knows i'm married to a real christian that your people at your work know i'm married to a real christian you know a lot of times your wife or your husband knows the things that go they know what your struggles are and they know what problems that you have and everything and if you're if your family knows and recognizes that that's a real christian think about what a testimony that is think about what a witness i believe there's a you know you think about um brother brown when he preached the message paradox he gave that challenge to the to the pentecostal churches and he said show me five people in your church that are signing crying for the abomination done in the city so many five people and he said i'll apologize for what i'm preaching show me five people that have the life the life of christ what kind of life a life where the same virtue the same knowledge and the same temperance that jesus had the same godliness the same brotherly kindness somebody with the same life of christ that will be a testimony now see he said the holy spirit is a seal and a seal takes both sides of the paper now see that's that's where we we stumble a little bit sometimes it's got to be both sides something that god will open up the word to you on the inside and begin to reveal himself but what good does it do if you preach a great sermon like we were talking about what good does it do to preach a great profound sermon and then your life is in shambles what what good does it do if you brother brown said in the message influence if you want to have influence with people make sure you have that heavenly influence first and then people will see you'll be able to influence other people what good does it do if you're preaching a great profound message but you're not living the life so it takes both of those things the word of god revealed on the inside that i know brother brown said in one place the blueprint opened up the blue when you see the blueprint of what you're doing here and your purpose here and what you're supposed to what god's word is doing to you and how it's doing it then then you begin to have confidence that god is doing something but on the outside on the outside other people can recognize in you that something has happened in your life your life is on display he said they see you standing here and see you when you go away not only in church but at everyday work you're sealed on both sides inside and outside by the joy that you have that comes from the faith the revelation that you have that that's what gives you joy and by the life that you live you're sealed in and outside that you know you're saved and the world knows you're saved by the life that you live for god bears witness you know you're saved and the world knows you're saved your wife or your husband know you're saved your family your kids know man my mom and daddy have a real patience what my mama something happens and and they don't fly off the handle but but there's there's a life that i can see let's go to the next slide both with signs and wonders and with diverse miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his will brother brown talked about in acts chapter 3 verse 4 he said peter fastening his eyes upon him with john he said brother when the world knows that you've been with jesus when the world knows you've been with jesus when you can live such an unadulterated life in this present world and in this darkness the world knows and can see that you've been with jesus that's what paul is talking about god also bearing them witness with a life when a rugged old vulgar prostitute of the street can become a lady washed in the blood of the lamb god is bearing witness that he lives god's bearing witness when you see the life of christ displayed now where does that come from though it comes from the revelation of god where it comes from you can't put this on by just struggling and trying you can't make yourself live that kind of a life it comes by the word of god received in your heart changing you bit by bit changing you precept upon precept word upon word here they're little they're little until the life of christ is made manifest in your members he said take a drunkard who's so low down that he would run around on his wife that he would mistreat his children and take the food from the table to spin on a prostitute let him get with jesus once you'll see him returning like legion who was in his right mind and clothed through his babies into his wife and to his loved ones you'll see somebody that's changed you know when that when the when the young people get in your car and and you're not playing rock music you're actually listening to the gospel that's a life on display when when they when they recognize when you when you are able to share a testimony that's encouraging that's a life on display and brother brown i'm going to finish on that i got three or four more minutes if if you pull up the next slide he talked about uh this this this minister john witt that he shared this story of this lady mcabee that out in oklahoma that um she got uh this was a long time ago she got to ride in a stagecoach and smoking cigars and doing all kinds of stuff and they ended up tar and feathering her they wanted to tar and feather she was so bad he said they didn't want to touch her and john witt was a was a was a preacher who began to share this testimony when he was overseas and he he put that story out there is there is there any he said gentlemen of the religions of the world is your religion got anything that would clean the hands of lady maccabee is your is your religion got anything that can take this this somebody like this and change their life to where they they're they're a foul individual doing all sorts of of things does your religion have something that will change this person and he said everybody set steel then he clapped his hands together and jumped up in the air he said glory be to god the blood of jesus christ won't only clean her hands but it'll clean her heart and make her his bride i believe in that kind of power in the gospel that see you don't have to sit here and and and say i'm a church member but when you go home and you you go find something naughty to look at on the internet you don't have to there's a power here that can actually change you i'm trying not to start preaching let's read one more and then we'll close uh hebrews chapter 2 verse 4. brother braham said in the lamb and the dove he said it is a new birth and a change of heart that changes a man from a dying being to a resurrected immortal son of god taking his plate on the seat of the believer's heart throwing himself on the father strong it's a nature change a nature change that's what the new birth is a nature change it makes you want to read the bible makes you want to come to church it changes it changes you it does something that you can't do yourself he said is it not true that the musicians can go ahead and come forward is it not true that the bible said the rain falls on the just and unjust the sun shines on the just and unjust you take a wheat field and the little heads are turning over it's a drought and i'm just going to skip down he said the holy spirit falls into a meeting and sometimes the believer and unbeliever worship by the same spirit but the fruit of the spirit proves what you are not the reaction of the spirit not to speak with tongues and not to shout but that goes with it too that all goes with it but unless the fruit of the spirit bears record with god's word you've just got a outward demonstration the fruit of the spirit what's the he said the fruit was your doctrine and when that is on display in your life then you've got a witness god bless you you
