[36:23] going to hold you all day so don't get
[36:26] nervous
[36:28] um I'm going read from the book of
[36:32] Genesis 3 Genesis the 3rd
[36:37] Chapter a simple thought I've been
[36:39] preaching on thought may be a blessing
[36:42] to you this evening amen Genesis
[36:46] 3 and I'm going to read verse 9 verse
[36:51] 10 and it reads like this and the Lord
[36:54] God called unto Adam and said unto him
[36:58] who are th and he said I heard thy voice
[37:02] in the garden and I was
[37:05] afraid because I was naked and I hid
[37:09] myself let's prayer I'm gracious father
[37:13] one more time Lord give me strength Lord
[37:16] give me help me to heal my body God help
[37:19] me to heal my mind Lord help me to get
[37:22] out of the way this evening God now
[37:25] father God take over this service in the
[37:27] name of Jesus Jesus we pray amen may we
[37:30] SE it one more
[37:35] time um thank the Lord for the reading
[37:38] of the word of God this evening amen as
[37:41] I Ti from the word of God is it says
[37:43] here in Genesis he said Adam said I I
[37:47] heard thy voice and I hid myself right
[37:51] right and in other words he had heard
[37:54] God's voice no doubt many times before
[37:56] but this time
[37:58] when you hear God's voice something had
[38:00] took place something had happened in his
[38:03] life transpired in his life that caused
[38:06] Adam to say I was afraid if you ever
[38:11] thought about that he never mentioned
[38:12] that where he never heard God say that
[38:14] word before but this first time it been
[38:17] mentioned he expressed something that
[38:19] God never spoke to him right so I took I
[38:22] took from that and I talked on under the
[38:25] attack of a fallen attribute
[38:28] amen H in other words and I took it
[38:31] because I realized here that Adam had
[38:33] fell under the attack of attribute that
[38:37] did not come from God right and I begin
[38:40] to look at them thing and I begin to
[38:42] realize here and we begin because Adam
[38:45] because Adam had become conscious of
[38:47] pharoh he had come conscious of
[38:50] something that God had never said amen
[38:52] right and I begin to look at this and I
[38:54] begin to think on them things and I
[38:56] begin to here that's what we all got to
[38:58] fight against we all got to fight
[39:00] against Fen attributes things that God
[39:04] had never said right and word God not in
[39:08] in word the devil tried to get God he
[39:12] tried to get Jesus to make him God if
[39:15] you fall down and worship me I give you
[39:18] the kingdoms of this world so we know
[39:21] that what the S Kingdom It could only be
[39:24] Darkness it could have only been death
[39:26] it could have been only sickness it
[39:28] could have only been fur H but Jesus
[39:31] said I refuse to bite out to this
[39:35] attribute that's right Amen in other
[39:37] words I refuse to give you that position
[39:39] Satan so I begin to look at and I begin
[39:42] to think and think on anything so now I
[39:44] begin to realize here that we got to war
[39:47] against it but now want to talk about
[39:49] the thing that the church fight the
[39:51] hardest yeah amen what good is this talk
[39:54] about you know we can look at
[39:56] denomination we can look at all the
[39:58] things around us but I want to talk
[40:00] about the thing that the church fight
[40:01] the most how I going to look at
[40:03] something that we got to deal with and
[40:05] we got to overcome because we realize
[40:07] here we are in The Exodus and exodus is
[40:11] in the two- part come out of and go into
[40:15] how we got to fight we got to deal with
[40:17] the spirit that caused them not to cross
[40:21] over you ever thought about that it was
[40:23] a spirit that followed that Revival that
[40:26] caus them not to cross over to the
[40:27] promised land and I begin to think of
[40:29] them thing and I'm going to try to find
[40:31] out what was the spirit that started
[40:34] that CA them when they come out because
[40:36] when they come out of Egypt Egypt was
[40:38] the type of the world maybe they quit
[40:40] drinking smoking and doing them but once
[40:43] they come out this the battle changes
[40:46] right right no longer Satan fighting
[40:49] with this and no longer Satan fighting
[40:51] us with drinking smoking running around
[40:54] with women and things so now he got to
[40:56] change the battle right sure the test
[41:00] come different so now we need to look at
[41:02] some things in the scripture uh uh uh
[41:05] this morning and begin to try to uh
[41:08] maybe go through the scripture and uh
[41:11] just
[41:12] might okay and let just go to the
[41:15] scripture I'm going to go to
[41:18] Exodus the 16th
[41:22] chapter see can we find out what stopped
[41:25] him from crossing over right and find
[41:28] out if we can nail this attribute down
[41:30] this falling attribute then we can but
[41:33] then we can follow this thing and see do
[41:35] it ever change because remember Satan
[41:37] found one way of stopping the church
[41:40] from going over he will keep on using
[41:43] that same technique all the way through
[41:47] so we begin to look him after
[41:50] this
[41:52] the 16
[41:55] chapter and I'm going to
[41:58] begin reading brother way I'm going to
[42:00] let you read for me brother not the
[42:03] seven verse down through the
[42:05] eth 7eventh and 8th yeah and in the
[42:10] morning then you shall see the glory of
[42:12] the
[42:13] Lord for that he had heareth your
[42:15] murmurings against the Lord wait a
[42:17] minute I want you to notice something in
[42:20] the morning you should see the glory of
[42:23] the Lord but when God showed up they
[42:26] should have been praising him they
[42:28] should have been giv him glory but when
[42:30] he prayed when he showed up there was
[42:33] muming right
[42:35] right and what are we that ye murmur
[42:38] against us and Moses said this shall be
[42:43] when the Lord shall give you in the
[42:46] evening flesh to eat and in the morning
[42:49] bread to the
[42:51] full for that the Lord heareth your
[42:53] murmurings which you murmur against him
[42:57] and what are we your murmurings are not
[43:00] against us but against the Lord right so
[43:03] now we find here he was on the way out
[43:07] Satan sto them finding fault with God
[43:11] right go down to the 17th chapter
[43:14] brother well we want to bring that one
[43:16] in 17th chapter verse two all the way
[43:19] down through verse
[43:21] three verse 2 and three we have verse 2
[43:25] 3 4 excuse me okay wherefore the people
[43:28] did CH with Moses and said give us water
[43:32] that we may
[43:33] drink and Moses said unto them why Chad
[43:36] ye with me wherefore do ye tempt the
[43:40] Lord and the people thirsted there for
[43:44] water and the people murmured against
[43:47] Moses and said wherefore is this that
[43:49] thou has brought us up out of Egypt to
[43:53] kill us and our children and our cattle
[43:55] with thirst
[43:57] and Moses Cried unto the Lord saying
[43:59] what shall I do unto this people they be
[44:03] almost ready to Stone me so now we find
[44:06] I want you to notice here what we seen
[44:08] in this picture here he was God done
[44:11] blessed
[44:13] them them that gave water but still they
[44:17] mumbled H so now we find here that Satan
[44:22] called the people to worship and a
[44:25] fallen attribute right amen now begin to
[44:27] look it up you know what brother Jord
[44:29] didn't stop how do no it didn't stop
[44:31] because once Satan see he can stop them
[44:34] from going in he's I'm going to use this
[44:36] all so now if you notice here he never
[44:39] stopped there so now he took it in the
[44:42] first an this y he stopped him with
[44:45] mumbling and complaining H he stopped
[44:48] him by mumbling y let me see what he did
[44:50] in the second and we go to U the book of
[44:54] uh St John 6
[45:05] St John 6 and I'm going to begin read at
[45:08] the 41st verse St John 6 41 verse and
[45:12] then the Jews mum and him because he
[45:16] said I am the bread which come came down
[45:21] from heaven and and they said it is is
[45:26] this not Jus the son of Joseph whom
[45:30] father and who father whom father and
[45:33] mother we know how is it then that he
[45:36] said I come came down from heaven and
[45:40] Jesus therefore understanding and Jesus
[45:45] excuse me Jesus answer and said unto
[45:48] them in other words why in m not among
[45:53] yourself why did that Spirit show up in
[45:56] the new Testament right right why did
[45:59] that Spirit came all the way from Moses
[46:01] time here go Jesus coming in the second
[46:04] act and it was the same
[46:07] spirit that same Spirit was following
[46:10] Jesus ministry and it was following
[46:13] Moses Ministry and then follow this
[46:15] ministry today amen the people today it
[46:18] ain't the people doing so much commit D
[46:21] all these but the people the biggest
[46:23] problem with the church in the message
[46:25] is mumbling right right
[46:27] HJ so we begin to go so Jesus knew these
[46:31] things let me jump down to the 16 verse
[46:34] to can of save
[46:36] time and then let me see
[46:42] here so J let me let me back up excuse
[46:45] me so J begin to explain this right he
[46:49] begin to he begin to explain his
[46:52] ministry and I'm going to get with the
[46:54] 51st verse that begin I'm the living
[46:56] bread which came down from heaven If any
[46:59] man eat of this bread he shall live
[47:03] forever and the bread that I give the
[47:07] bread I will give is my My Flesh right
[47:11] and that my flesh which I will give for
[47:15] the life of the
[47:17] world then he goes and says
[47:19] here the Jew
[47:24] therefore SC among thems
[47:27] saying how can this man give us his
[47:30] flesh to eat they could not tap in on
[47:33] the Revelation they were trying to get
[47:36] Revelation by flesh H and you can not
[47:40] understand God by flesh because Jesus
[47:43] said Flesh and Blood never give this to
[47:46] you and then Jesus answer said and Jesus
[47:50] said unto them ver ver I say unto you
[47:52] except you eat the Flesh of the son of
[47:54] man and drink his blood y have no life
[47:58] so now he bring this mysterious
[48:01] Revelation to them without expl
[48:04] explaining
[48:05] right then he said whosoever shall eat
[48:08] my flesh and drink my blood have eternal
[48:12] life and I will raise him up at the last
[48:14] day for my flesh is meat indeed and my
[48:17] blood is drink indeed he that eateth my
[48:19] flesh and drinking my blood dwelleth in
[48:22] me and I in
[48:24] him as the father and as the father
[48:28] living has sent me and I live by the
[48:31] father so he that eat me right even he
[48:37] shall live by me right this is the bread
[48:40] which came down from heaven not as your
[48:43] father did eat Mana in the your father
[48:45] had mana and are dead how that eternally
[48:49] separated after it come out right he
[48:53] that eat eat of this bread shall live
[48:56] forever amen and he this thing said he
[49:00] in the synagogue as he
[49:02] taught and say and many of and many
[49:07] therefor of the disciple when they he
[49:09] this y when they heard this if they hard
[49:13] say who can he yeah right and when Jesus
[49:17] know remember the word know the spirits
[49:20] right so the word would be begin to
[49:22] discern the spirit because that same
[49:25] spirit that was in the book of AG was
[49:27] showing up here and Jesus had come in
[49:29] contact with the spirit and he began to
[49:32] deal with the same Spirit right of the
[49:34] same thing that people do all the time M
[49:37] and Jesus says him and Jesus knew him
[49:40] himself and that his not with church
[49:43] people by the way you know the world
[49:47] body it's the church people
[49:49] that there was people that said they
[49:52] loved him there were people that went to
[49:54] church the acist were church people
[49:57] [Music]
[49:58] right so Jesus said it to them and Jesus
[50:02] said and Jesus said and Jesus said said
[50:05] to his disciples that his disciples Mur
[50:08] at it and he said unto them does this
[50:10] offend you yeah and then he go to and
[50:13] said what if you see the son of man the
[50:16] son of man Ascend up where he was before
[50:20] right where he was before right it is
[50:23] the spirit quick the flesh Propet
[50:24] nothing nothing but the word I speak to
[50:27] you they are spirit and they are life
[50:29] and but there are some of you that what
[50:32] right H the attribute of a falling
[50:35] nature H was mumbling that's the sign of
[50:39] unbelief right that was the sign that he
[50:42] know that something was
[50:45] wrong some of you that believe not for
[50:47] Jesus knew from the beginning who they
[50:49] they were that believe not and who shall
[50:52] betray him right the word knows all
[50:54] things so he was not cut off of God he
[50:56] was not he was not he was not took by
[50:58] surprise he knew that was a fallen
[51:01] attribute he knew that Satan was
[51:03] following him and he knew that same was
[51:05] going to church i i m
[51:10] right then he says
[51:12] here in the 65th verse he
[51:15] says and he said and he said therefore I
[51:18] say unto you that no man can
[51:22] come no man can come unto me except it
[51:25] was given to him of my father right from
[51:27] that time what did the spirit do same
[51:30] thing it did in the book of Exodus it
[51:32] was going to stop them from going in to
[51:35] for for the word for that hour so any
[51:37] words so once he got this mumbling in
[51:39] there he was able to stop them for going
[51:43] all the way with the word h he was not
[51:45] concerned how long they' been in church
[51:48] he was concerned in them that they don't
[51:49] get to the book of he says from that
[51:53] time show you what happened to him the
[51:56] last stage of that Fallen attribute
[51:59] right he said from that
[52:02] time find and she said therefore he said
[52:06] oh no no in the the 66 verse he said
[52:09] from that time many of the disciples
[52:12] went back and walk no more with him if
[52:16] you go back if you didn't walk no more
[52:19] with God how if you went back and you
[52:21] never come back to God that mean that
[52:24] you're going actually eternally
[52:26] separated from
[52:28] God is happen for St John the 6th
[52:32] chapter and the 66 verse he scrapped
[52:35] them off the book they went how they
[52:39] refus to walk in the light and they
[52:41] refuse to walk in the light what the
[52:43] what what was the problem why didn't he
[52:45] walk in the light why did he keep F
[52:47] Jesus because they could not understand
[52:49] him right exactly exactly they could not
[52:54] comprehend they tried to have tried to
[52:57] understand Supernatural Revelation with
[53:00] with natural understanding so now Jesus
[53:03] come to the after he done got rid of all
[53:06] them cuz they couldn't they was there
[53:08] Ming and complaining so Jesus said I got
[53:10] rid of that crowd right there let me go
[53:12] and deal with the rest of now you
[53:13] remember Judah stayed in his Revival to
[53:15] the end yeah yeah right cuz he was he'll
[53:19] be so close so he stayed and followed
[53:22] his Revival to the End Amen that's right
[53:24] so we find here so we find here in the
[53:27] 67 verse and then Jesus said unto the 12
[53:31] will you also
[53:32] go in other words you all your buddies
[53:35] leaving all your church people leaving
[53:37] cuz I'm preaching this Revelation so you
[53:39] also go with them and then what what
[53:42] Simon Peter said and and then Simon
[53:44] Peter answered and said Lord whom shall
[53:47] we go that has the words of eternal life
[53:50] he said for we believe and are sure that
[53:54] th the Son of God the the we we we we
[53:57] believe that the Christ the son of the
[53:59] Living God and Jesus answer said them I
[54:03] have I have have not I chosen you 12 and
[54:07] one of you is a
[54:09] d and then word so he said I you and he
[54:13] spoke of Judah is the son of Simon for
[54:17] he for he it was that shall betray him
[54:22] and him being being one of the 12 so he
[54:26] am I chose you but one was chosen
[54:29] Hallelujah he was never chosen for
[54:31] eternal life he was chosen to reject the
[54:35] word oh he was chosen to have confusion
[54:39] and and cause him to be scratched away
[54:41] of the book H we begin to look
[54:44] here I looked up the word muming and
[54:48] complaint and the word CH is the same
[54:53] word
[54:54] muming it it came from the
[54:57] word mumbling complaining and shine is
[55:01] the same word it us it if you were break
[55:04] look it up it means to find fault to
[55:09] blame or to find fault with somebody I
[55:12] said if you go back and you follow the
[55:14] message how do you follow the people to
[55:16] run the message the biggest problem we
[55:19] got is finding
[55:21] fault somebody always got something bad
[55:24] to say about somebody else somebody
[55:27] looking at somebody mistak that run
[55:29] somebody down we find fult we find blame
[55:33] and somebody always we better my church
[55:35] is better than your church we dressed in
[55:37] we more holy than you we always try to
[55:40] find folk to put this church down put
[55:42] that CH is on the dev
[55:46] right now we going to look
[55:48] here that Spirit just just stop down oh
[55:52] no once he got once Satan use the
[55:55] technique he keep on and keep on he may
[55:58] change it up he might change it meod but
[56:01] he don't change that Spirit right right
[56:03] so what he do he go on here and we find
[56:06] Paul picks it up and when Paul said it
[56:08] in Hebrews Hebrews 11 and verse Hebrews
[56:11] 3 verse 7 he said God swore that he
[56:14] would not let him enter into his rest
[56:17] what because not because they was not
[56:19] drinking not because they were smoking
[56:21] just because they kept finding F right
[56:24] right amen right just because they kept
[56:28] complaining just because they couldn't
[56:29] come to the Revelation how let God and
[56:32] just praise God for who he is but every
[56:34] trying to find fault I see something but
[56:37] there no fault in him because when they
[56:38] prove the word they could not find fault
[56:41] in
[56:42] christly so we begin to go look here
[56:45] let's just look at this thing a little
[56:47] closer we talking about mly complaining
[56:50] and falling attributes that been
[56:52] following this message been following
[56:54] the people around this message that
[56:56] there was so many wars going on
[56:58] spiritually speaking pastors fighting
[57:00] against Pastor people's in the church
[57:02] fighting against people in the church
[57:04] people leaving the church when people
[57:06] leave the church what it what it big
[57:07] thing if you go back and you n now they
[57:09] found fault right they found somebody to
[57:12] blame for something they couldn't
[57:14] overcome and they they found somebody
[57:18] that they found some do maybe some
[57:20] Revelation that maybe they could not
[57:22] understand so the bir say the preacher
[57:24] preach false do I'm leaving yeah how do
[57:27] you say preach a f doctor you don't even
[57:29] understand the Revelation how do you
[57:31] need to ask God to give you a revelation
[57:33] how do so sometime people jump up how
[57:35] maybe it might go look maybe they have a
[57:37] mar situation they trying to find
[57:39] somebody to shoot
[57:41] down make a court so they can overcome
[57:43] or do a certain thing and maybe the
[57:45] message won't let them do it so that's I
[57:47] got to find somewhere else that's right
[57:49] so we got to find fault we got to find
[57:52] blame y so it ain't nobody to blame the
[57:54] point of then we got to come back and
[57:56] recognize how God we all human being and
[57:59] we all got failure we all got weakness
[58:02] but that one perfect person in our M and
[58:04] that's Jesus Christ and there ain't no
[58:06] fault in
[58:07] him so we begin to go look at
[58:10] him so as I begin to narrow us down so
[58:13] it kept moving the spirit kept moving
[58:16] and the last place I saw the Spirit
[58:19] manifested showed his head up again and
[58:22] he showed his head up in the book of
[58:25] Jude
[58:28] M yep he showed his head up in the book
[58:32] of
[58:36] JW last book before Revelation so you
[58:40] see when the spirit started it didn't
[58:42] never was just stop right it it moved
[58:44] from Exodus all the way down to the New
[58:46] Testament all the way down to Matthew it
[58:49] moved into the book of Beth look John
[58:52] has been moved there under Jesus
[58:54] ministry now after the Holy Ghost the
[58:56] spirit was still moving among the people
[58:59] right how it never Chang it kept moving
[59:02] all the way through the book how the
[59:03] 16th verse brother uh wait 16
[59:08] yeah these are murmurers complainers
[59:11] walking after their own lust and their
[59:14] mouth speaketh great swelling words
[59:16] having men's persons in admiration
[59:18] because of Advantage okay if you notice
[59:23] here The Same Spirit it now Paul Jude
[59:27] picks it up said he are M and
[59:31] complainers in in words walking out
[59:35] their own lust honey once you don't see
[59:38] the word you going to be L by some kind
[59:40] of spirit once you find fault with the
[59:43] word it don't leave you become bable for
[59:45] any type of a spirit to take you over
[59:48] how we find fault everybody B here so
[59:51] Paul said I got to do something like
[59:53] this I got to give the people something
[59:56] how that they can overcome this spr
[59:59] right I I can't leave a pain I they got
[1:00:02] to they got to let go the spirit how do
[1:00:05] we go long as we find fault with each
[1:00:07] other we have to find fault with God
[1:00:08] because that what God do
[1:00:10] right so Paul said I got to come up with
[1:00:14] something I got to knock the spirit in
[1:00:16] the head once and for all so Paul picks
[1:00:19] up Philippians 2 and verse 14 Paul says
[1:00:22] here do all things yeah what do all
[1:00:26] things
[1:00:28] mean it mean all things right that mean
[1:00:31] that if it's all thing it cover
[1:00:33] everything yeah they say do all
[1:00:35] things without mumbling and complain
[1:00:39] without mumbling and dispute Hallelujah
[1:00:42] in other words in other words telling
[1:00:45] you here in other without hardship
[1:00:47] without suffering H take no thought on
[1:00:51] tomorrow for God know what you have need
[1:00:53] of before you even ask right the reason
[1:00:56] people M and get ahead of God because
[1:00:59] they don't want to trust him right so if
[1:01:01] God don't give them something today then
[1:01:03] they really complain about it tomorrow
[1:01:05] hallu if God don't give me no shoes
[1:01:07] hallu I know what I'm going to do H so
[1:01:10] they begin to complain how do they build
[1:01:12] they build a complain because they
[1:01:14] didn't have water they build a complain
[1:01:16] because they didn't have food but God
[1:01:17] said take no thought on what you going
[1:01:19] to eat or what you going wi I have know
[1:01:22] what you need of there's nothing to
[1:01:24] complain about when you know God is in
[1:01:26] control am the complaint is when you're
[1:01:29] not really sure that God going to stand
[1:01:31] behind his word how so now it build up a
[1:01:34] question will God provide for me will
[1:01:37] God do what he say going to do H but it
[1:01:40] a your business to tell God how to run
[1:01:42] this business it's your job to accept
[1:01:46] God Peter said we are sure
[1:01:49] right I'm sure that you're doing what
[1:01:51] you say you going to do God and I'm
[1:01:53] going to stay with this word all the way
[1:01:55] to the end how do I'm not going to let
[1:01:57] nothing come and and I'm not going to
[1:01:58] stir up here I ain't got nothing to
[1:02:00] complain about how do I got shoes on my
[1:02:03] feet I got food on my table I got a roof
[1:02:06] on my head how Lord I want to thank you
[1:02:09] for your blessings on
[1:02:14] me Mom
[1:02:16] complaining and I realized here as I
[1:02:19] begin to study this thing here that
[1:02:21] attribute right there is what we got to
[1:02:23] deal with right because that what we
[1:02:26] find we find so many SLP rocks around

[1:04:19] to he did with a little message
[1:04:22] say on and he says here and I use it I
[1:04:26] tied this in with this he says in the
[1:04:30] message
[1:04:31] uh yeah yeah s NE he
[1:04:35] says the God of this world today the the
[1:04:39] worship person of this world today is
[1:04:42] Satan and the peoples are ignorant
[1:04:45] worship is Satan but it is Satan
[1:04:49] impersonate himself as the church as the
[1:04:53] called out ones as the one said I'm
[1:04:56] going in the Rapture how in other words
[1:04:58] he got he want to deal with the people
[1:05:00] this religious spirit it follows the
[1:05:03] church he gets in the church and he
[1:05:05] stays in the church the called out group
[1:05:07] that's the one he want to deal with
[1:05:09] right as the church they are worshiping
[1:05:12] Satan thinking they worshiping God oh
[1:05:15] yeah though though through the church
[1:05:17] but it is the way Satan has done it how
[1:05:20] did he do it like did he kept the people
[1:05:23] in the P right right
[1:05:26] amen the Bible say let us be content in
[1:05:29] all things right it's hard for people to
[1:05:32] get the mind of contentment it's all for
[1:05:34] the people to bed how that God ain't
[1:05:36] going to stand behind his word I got so
[1:05:37] many people go here and everybody worri
[1:05:39] about what we going to do what we going
[1:05:41] to do about the economy I don't care
[1:05:43] about the economy my God is able to
[1:05:45] provide in the midst of the whole thing
[1:05:48] I'm not going around putting myself to
[1:05:50] sleep complaining about what's going on
[1:05:52] when I serve a God that own the child of
[1:05:56] him he I never seen the right or SE bre
[1:06:00] what I got to worry
[1:06:02] about we got a group down herebody
[1:06:05] complaining I wonder God going to stay
[1:06:07] here I going to lose everything I got
[1:06:10] wor I'm going this going to happen I
[1:06:11] said people I said that that's the less
[1:06:13] of my problems right I don't I don't
[1:06:15] lose sleep over houses I don't lose
[1:06:17] sleep over cars and all this stuff going
[1:06:19] to go away anyway but my God say take no
[1:06:21] thought on the things right that's right
[1:06:23] amen he go to the say
[1:06:26] so when he deal with this thing he goes
[1:06:28] back in and I'm I'm just deal with this
[1:06:30] and say Satan is the most worship person
[1:06:34] of this day he impersonated himself as
[1:06:38] the church and in the church they were
[1:06:41] still
[1:06:43] complain when it came out of the book of
[1:06:45] Exodus it was the call up the
[1:06:48] church amen so they were still
[1:06:51] complaining we are not church we bride
[1:06:54] are we wife amen we not even we wife now
[1:06:58] so we should we come here so we begin to
[1:07:00] realize here so why did he Nar it down
[1:07:03] because he going to n you he bringing
[1:07:05] his attribute down he exposing a fallen
[1:07:10] attribute and we find here today people
[1:07:12] say well brother je they said they said
[1:07:15] well I'm so sad well that sad that that
[1:07:17] sadness didn't come from God right that
[1:07:20] was a bed attribute so what Jesus came
[1:07:22] doing if you notice in the book of he
[1:07:25] the why you sad because he knew there
[1:07:27] was an attribute that was not of
[1:07:31] him so he goes to S
[1:07:35] NE and I was dealing with this and S he
[1:07:39] said and then you are a you are one of
[1:07:44] his
[1:07:44] attributes from his own body God has
[1:07:48] attribut in his body like you are an
[1:07:51] attribute of your father and I took this
[1:07:55] right here because this is what Jesus
[1:07:58] begin to deal with the spirit and bring
[1:08:00] out to show you what seed was which who
[1:08:03] which which one was of God which one was
[1:08:05] of the Devil by attributes yeah how the
[1:08:09] way they respond the way they act the
[1:08:12] attributes they speak it tells where
[1:08:14] they come from amen so Jesus goes in s
[1:08:17] uh St John the 8th chapter I want to
[1:08:20] look at this here because it deals with
[1:08:21] attributes
[1:08:26] St John the 8th chapter let's de here if
[1:08:29] you notice here when Jesus get to St
[1:08:31] John the 8th chapter he start preaching
[1:08:38] serpy he began to identify who SE was
[1:08:42] God and which SE was under devil
[1:08:46] right he didn't make he didn't he didn't
[1:08:48] play around with it he goes right to it
[1:08:50] and he begin to let them know if you
[1:08:53] were the attribute of this seed you
[1:08:55] would do
[1:08:56] this so he go to St John
[1:09:02] 8 St John 8th chapter I'm going to begin
[1:09:05] to look at this here he deals with
[1:09:08] this St John 8th chapter and I want to
[1:09:12] begin reading at the
[1:09:14] 3
[1:09:16] 7 maybe I go up a little forward to this
[1:09:19] the 31st verse down to the 31 and then
[1:09:22] he says here and then Jesus said to
[1:09:24] those Jews which beli on
[1:09:28] him if ye continue in my word then ye
[1:09:33] are my what in other words if you
[1:09:36] continue in my word what would make him
[1:09:38] not continue in the word the only way
[1:09:40] they would continue in the word you must
[1:09:42] have to find fault with it you must have
[1:09:44] to find some kind of blame it you got to
[1:09:46] find that something is wrong with it
[1:09:48] order not to stay with it how once you a
[1:09:52] once you not content that the word going
[1:09:54] to do what say you got to find some
[1:09:56] other CH exactly so Jesus says him he
[1:10:01] said and ye shall know the truth and the
[1:10:05] truth shall make you free amen they
[1:10:09] answered him now who they responding
[1:10:12] Jesus told them what to do I'm going to
[1:10:15] tell you who see you because now we
[1:10:17] taking a DNA
[1:10:18] test yeah and why when I get through
[1:10:21] with this test you'll know what side of
[1:10:23] the fish you on right
[1:10:26] so here they go they go back and they
[1:10:29] said we be Abraham SE oh yeah all right
[1:10:34] that a testifying we are religious we
[1:10:38] are in the message and we Abraham SE L
[1:10:42] said we be brother bread and
[1:10:44] seeds that don't make you going inter R
[1:10:47] that's right that a what God looking for
[1:10:49] he's not judging you by the body when
[1:10:51] Brandon he's judging you by the
[1:10:53] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:10:55] amen so but a lot of people because they
[1:10:58] know brother Brandon they making the
[1:10:59] rtion that don't mean no more than you
[1:11:01] know the Poke right right H that ain't
[1:11:04] what God judg you by God judge you by
[1:11:06] receiving the spiritual Revelation I
[1:11:09] don't care who the vessel is if it's the
[1:11:11] Holy Ghost speaking and you receive the
[1:11:13] Revelation you speaking to
[1:11:15] God but they thought just because they
[1:11:18] can prove that they've been circumcised
[1:11:20] In the Flesh and they can prove it
[1:11:23] absolutely they can prove that
[1:11:25] they every one of those guys that was
[1:11:27] said there every one of them have been
[1:11:29] proven to be circumcised and they can
[1:11:31] prove by the circumcision we are Abraham
[1:11:34] seed in the
[1:11:35] flesh but God was dealing with the flesh
[1:11:39] right he was dealing with the soul how
[1:11:41] did he deal with the Revelation right so
[1:11:43] he goes on and says
[1:11:46] him they said and they answer him and
[1:11:48] said we be aaham SE and will will not in
[1:11:51] abondance to any man how say how say
[1:11:55] dust y shall be made free and Jesus
[1:11:59] answered and said unto them ver ver I
[1:12:01] say unto you whoo committed sin is the
[1:12:05] what H other words whosoever commits sin
[1:12:08] is the servant of sin and if you
[1:12:11] committed sin you cannot be the
[1:12:13] attribute of God because sin cannot
[1:12:15] dwell in
[1:12:17] Goden so people make Jesus make Jesus
[1:12:20] look like he and Jesus didn't have no s
[1:12:23] how Jesus never had Jesus never was born
[1:12:26] under under under a fallen attribute
[1:12:29] that way he never was he just became it
[1:12:31] right right H but he never sin in the
[1:12:34] first place right why he didn't s
[1:12:37] because he didn't have a past life right
[1:12:40] you could look back at Jesus life to say
[1:12:41] your grandfather done this and your
[1:12:43] great grandmother was a scripper and
[1:12:45] your great grandpa was a bootle and all
[1:12:47] when you look back to Jesus life he
[1:12:49] didn't even have a pth and if he didn't
[1:12:51] have a pth how can you look like and say
[1:12:53] he only when you look at you can only
[1:12:55] see his future where he come from how so
[1:12:59] Jesus was made Perfection that why we go
[1:13:01] back and get I we do away with our past
[1:13:04] life so we can stand before God
[1:13:06] justifi right
[1:13:10] right and he
[1:13:14] says 35th verse it say and the servant
[1:13:18] abided not in the house forever but the
[1:13:21] son abide forever amen if the son
[1:13:24] therefore shall make you free yes shall
[1:13:27] be free indeed I know that you are
[1:13:30] Abraham's
[1:13:32] seed but ye see to do
[1:13:37] what did it come from God no that did
[1:13:41] not come from God that's right so the
[1:13:43] attribute that they was expressing did
[1:13:45] not come from God because if that would
[1:13:48] have been God why would they want to
[1:13:50] kill a man right right that trying to
[1:13:53] tell them the truth Glory why would you
[1:13:55] want to kill your pastor or a preacher
[1:13:58] that's preaching the truth right because
[1:14:00] truth uncovers what attributes you are
[1:14:03] right so now he took the truth and as he
[1:14:06] spoke the word it be to reveal who it
[1:14:10] was right and then he says here he said
[1:14:13] I I know you're abam see but you seek to
[1:14:15] kill me me because my
[1:14:19] word uhoh has no place that's right in
[1:14:24] you am a word is a thought of God
[1:14:26] expressed how the word of God had to
[1:14:29] have you on his mind or or else you
[1:14:32] could never be Express how God got to
[1:14:34] see in his mind how what God look at
[1:14:37] that why God can look down here and say
[1:14:39] Matthew 7:21 say I never knew you right
[1:14:44] after all the signs and W they did he
[1:14:46] said I never knew you right it goes back
[1:14:50] with you in the word right right P did
[1:14:52] he says him
[1:14:55] then he says to them right here my word
[1:14:58] has no place in you and then the 38th
[1:15:02] verse I spake that which I have seen of
[1:15:05] my father I say it now we say he said
[1:15:08] you the attribute of your father right
[1:15:10] Jesus is expressing I am the attribute
[1:15:14] of my father so now he if you notice
[1:15:17] here he's going back to two daddies or
[1:15:20] two fathers he's telling them I am the
[1:15:24] attribute of my father in other words
[1:15:26] what he say I am the mystery of God
[1:15:29] revealed H when you see me you see the
[1:15:31] father when you see me you don't see my
[1:15:34] V but Jesus said when you see me you see
[1:15:36] my V why because he was the very
[1:15:38] revelation of God hallah he was just God
[1:15:42] had Tabernacle himself and skin and he
[1:15:44] revealed himself through Christ so the
[1:15:46] revelation of God was walking on
[1:15:49] skin so now he was he said he said he
[1:15:53] said he said he would tell tell him he
[1:15:55] said I am the 38 verse he get he said he
[1:16:00] said I speak that what I speak that
[1:16:03] which I have seen of my father and and
[1:16:05] yet do that which you have seen with
[1:16:09] your
[1:16:11] father I done this what I seen with my
[1:16:14] father and you are doing that what you
[1:16:17] have seen your father if you notice here
[1:16:19] what was he doing he separating them by
[1:16:21] attributes right because they had
[1:16:23] something that was in there them that
[1:16:25] never will part of God right to murder
[1:16:28] somebody right so he knew that they was
[1:16:31] Fallen attributes they could be
[1:16:33] religious but they could never come to
[1:16:35] the knowledge of the message amen and
[1:16:38] watch what he
[1:16:39] said and they answered and said unto him
[1:16:43] Abraham is our father they still try to
[1:16:45] hold to the
[1:16:47] confession they still try to hold to the
[1:16:49] confession Abraham is and Jesus said
[1:16:52] unto them if you were Abraham children
[1:16:54] they would do the works of Abraham yeah
[1:16:57] right so now he putting it back there he
[1:16:59] keep going back and forth if you notice
[1:17:01] the battle is back and forth how they
[1:17:03] they they putting claims on Abraham and
[1:17:05] Jesus said you know it can't be what
[1:17:08] would he dealing with he was not dealing
[1:17:10] with because they was good people you
[1:17:11] could not look at their life and find
[1:17:14] anything that was wrong with them that's
[1:17:15] right they was Pharisees they were
[1:17:18] religious people but Jesus was looking
[1:17:20] at their DNA he was looking at their
[1:17:22] spiritual genealogy he knew that they
[1:17:24] didn't nothing to do with Abraham he
[1:17:26] knew they wouldn't part of him right
[1:17:29] Jesus said right here the before but you
[1:17:31] seek to kill me why couldn't they get
[1:17:34] away from that Spirit oh yeah why did
[1:17:37] that Spirit keep riding and bringing
[1:17:39] this influence to want to murder him he
[1:17:42] said y seek the kill me premeditated
[1:17:46] murder they were premeditating to kill
[1:17:49] an innocent man and then what they
[1:17:51] eventually did they premeditated killer
[1:17:55] inocent man and here it was again and
[1:17:58] Jesus said you seek to kill me a man
[1:18:00] that have told you the truth which I
[1:18:02] have heard which I have heard of God did
[1:18:06] just did not Abraham but you do the
[1:18:09] Deeds of
[1:18:11] what how could you call religious
[1:18:15] peoples yay do the Deeds of your
[1:18:19] father Jesus was actually bringing a
[1:18:23] separation between the two groups of
[1:18:25] people right he breaking the separation
[1:18:27] I'm I'm a God and I'm letting you know
[1:18:29] where you are where you come from in
[1:18:31] order for you to have true Revelation
[1:18:33] you got to know where you come from
[1:18:35] Hallelujah if you don't know where you
[1:18:36] come from the devil going to talk you
[1:18:37] out of it anyway that's why we find so
[1:18:39] many Christians give up how the first
[1:18:40] time they hit their face in the mud how
[1:18:42] I'm out of here I can't do it no when
[1:18:44] your Christian fall down he got a
[1:18:46] revelation to stand back up and keep go
[1:18:50] amen one thing that a Christian don't do
[1:18:52] is give
[1:18:53] upen that's right
[1:18:56] and he says right
[1:18:58] here then said they to him we be not
[1:19:02] born of fornication uhoh uhoh yeah we
[1:19:07] have one father even God that's what I'm
[1:19:10] say what you get when you don't get
[1:19:11] scripture Revelation because this what
[1:19:14] they were bringing to Jesus they had no
[1:19:16] scripture to support that thought that's
[1:19:18] right all they had was what somebody
[1:19:21] said about it oh my H they had no
[1:19:24] background no Foundation to support that
[1:19:27] Jesus was born in fornication there is
[1:19:29] no scripture say that that's right all
[1:19:31] the scripture we got for his birth
[1:19:33] Behold a
[1:19:36] virgin how did they get this scripture
[1:19:39] how did they get this say it was not
[1:19:42] scripture like we got a lot of things a
[1:19:44] scripture today it let come in but if
[1:19:47] it's not scripture it got no foundation
[1:19:49] so it's a wrong attribute how here they
[1:19:52] were they bringing this anization
[1:19:54] against him they were finding fault with
[1:19:56] him they were trying to blame him on
[1:19:59] something that he didn't even have to
[1:20:00] worry about how can they care he he have
[1:20:03] to worry about forgiving him for that he
[1:20:04] never did it in the first place right he
[1:20:07] was never born that way in the first
[1:20:09] place so this really didn't mean nothing
[1:20:11] to him it was just a
[1:20:13] say he said they said and they said they
[1:20:18] said to him we not be born of
[1:20:19] fornication we have one father even God
[1:20:21] and Jesus said unto them
[1:20:25] if y were if no if God were your father
[1:20:29] y would love what because God is
[1:20:32] attribute of Love hey it was two
[1:20:35] attributes manifest one was the
[1:20:37] attribute to murder him and find fault
[1:20:40] and pray and find blame and mumbl
[1:20:43] complain against him and the other was
[1:20:45] if you were the attribute of God you
[1:20:47] would love me right Hallelujah and then
[1:20:49] he says here and he said he said he said
[1:20:53] yeah if they were God you will love me
[1:20:56] for I proceed for and came from God
[1:20:59] neither I came of myself but he Des sent
[1:21:02] me right how do ye not understand my
[1:21:07] speech I went back to what I was trying
[1:21:10] to show this morning they did not cuz my
[1:21:12] sheep hear my voice right excuse me I
[1:21:16] don't care how religious you are if you
[1:21:18] can't understand the word or hear his
[1:21:20] word something wrong with your
[1:21:21] Revelation right H because if you she
[1:21:24] you always was God don't you don't
[1:21:26] become Sheep by rebirth come on so if
[1:21:29] you was a sheep you always was sheep and
[1:21:32] any way you understand when she call she
[1:21:35] understand she why do you not understand
[1:21:38] my speech
[1:21:40] because why do you not understand my be
[1:21:43] even because ye cannot what why because
[1:21:48] if you could hear the word you only way
[1:21:50] you can prove that your part of God in
[1:21:52] the ability to hear the word right
[1:21:55] right my sheep hear my voice right they
[1:21:59] did not hear him right they could not
[1:22:02] understand himly because they didn't
[1:22:04] know his voice because she don't know
[1:22:06] sheep a crow don't call her evil because
[1:22:10] the eagle don't understand gr do he only
[1:22:13] understand Eagle so now here Eagle
[1:22:16] talking to a a wolf so wol wouldn't
[1:22:19] understand sheep right so now he can
[1:22:22] understand by the ability to hear he
[1:22:24] know they couldn't understand so now he
[1:22:26] can EAS bring them to the place and then
[1:22:28] he can tear the seals off of them and
[1:22:30] show them who they are oh yeah once he
[1:22:33] got him to this place if you notice he
[1:22:35] drove the tag down when he said why do
[1:22:38] not you understand my speech because my
[1:22:41] word because you cannot hear my word so
[1:22:44] now he took it to the plate you cannot
[1:22:46] get Revelation right if you don't get
[1:22:49] Revelation you going to be saved right
[1:22:50] cuz Revelation is fa so now he di once
[1:22:54] he did this he was able to take the
[1:22:56] seals and show who they really were he
[1:22:58] if you notice right here he did not be
[1:23:00] around the bush once he said this he was
[1:23:02] ready to
[1:23:03] expose
[1:23:05] right the 44th verse he just went on and
[1:23:08] Expos that's right he showed who they
[1:23:10] was right here right so now there's no
[1:23:12] more doubt what they come from right he
[1:23:15] show what they originated from he show
[1:23:17] what they he show you what they started
[1:23:19] and he going to show what they going in
[1:23:21] there now he said here he said you all
[1:23:24] of your what father father right the
[1:23:29] what if you notice he named right he
[1:23:33] named him right right it was no more
[1:23:36] presuming right to venture without
[1:23:38] authority to guess as I'm say he named
[1:23:41] who they was so now he telling them you
[1:23:44] of your father the devil and the lust of
[1:23:47] your father y would do he was a
[1:23:51] murderer from the beginning and other
[1:23:54] words he was a murderer from the
[1:23:57] beginning before he received the name
[1:24:00] devil he was a murderer he had the name
[1:24:03] Lucifer H he murdered those angels that
[1:24:05] called him to believe alive and got them
[1:24:07] eternally separated right and he cast
[1:24:10] down to the world and not to the Earth
[1:24:12] and I called him serpent did his name
[1:24:14] change for serpent to the devil and did
[1:24:16] it change in the devil to from the devil
[1:24:19] to death
[1:24:21] Hallelujah so he begin to deal with
[1:24:23] attributes
[1:24:24] and he says here he's a murder from the
[1:24:27] beginning he B not in the truth because
[1:24:29] there is no truth in him right when he
[1:24:32] speak a lie he speak of his own for he
[1:24:35] is a lie and the father of Li so he
[1:24:40] begin to deal with the attribute he
[1:24:43] begin to deal with that spirit and
[1:24:45] people what I'm trying to say here that
[1:24:47] why we got to be conscious of how much
[1:24:49] we complaining finding fult blaming in
[1:24:52] other words take it AC as ations and
[1:24:55] things because it's really it's it's the
[1:24:57] wrong attribute the only way we only
[1:24:59] thing that God created open the heart
[1:25:02] Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord so I can
[1:25:04] hear you so I can worship you H that's
[1:25:06] what God want us to do he called us but
[1:25:09] the Lord he called to live our life not
[1:25:12] for somebody else for not for our but
[1:25:14] for somebody
[1:25:16] else amen I get ready to bring this to a
