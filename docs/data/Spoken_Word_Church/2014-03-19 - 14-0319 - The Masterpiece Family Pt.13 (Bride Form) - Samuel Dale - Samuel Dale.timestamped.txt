[13:17] announcements You' like turning your
[13:19] scriptures turn to Revelations
[13:22] 1 and we will try to go into have we
[13:26] missed anything okay
[13:36] Revelations
[13:39] one the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[13:43] God gave unto him to show unto his
[13:46] servants things which must shortly come
[13:48] to pass and he said and signified it by
[13:51] his Angel to his unto his servant John
[13:54] who by record of the word of God and the
[13:56] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[13:58] things that he saw blessed is he that
[14:01] readeth and they that hear the words of
[14:03] this prophecy and keep those things
[14:05] which are written therein for the time
[14:07] is at hand John to the seven churches
[14:09] which are in Asia Grace be unto you in
[14:12] peace from him which is and which was
[14:15] and which is to come and from the seven
[14:17] spirits which are before his throne and
[14:20] from remember there's not seven
[14:22] different Spirits it's the holy spirit
[14:25] in manifesting through seven Church ages
[14:30] and from Jesus Christ who is the
[14:31] faithful witness and the first begotten
[14:34] of the dead and the prince of the kings
[14:37] of the earth unto him that loved us and
[14:40] washed our us from our sins in his own
[14:42] blood and ha made us Kings and Priests
[14:45] unto God and his father to him be glory
[14:49] and Dominion forever and ever amen
[14:51] behold he cometh with clouds and never I
[14:53] shall see him they also which pierced
[14:56] him
[14:58] all that pierced all kindreds of the
[15:01] Earth shall whail because of him even so
[15:05] amen I am Alpha and Omega the beginning
[15:07] and the ending sayth the Lord which is
[15:09] and which was and which is to come the
[15:12] almighty and I John also am your brother
[15:15] and companion in Tribulation and in the
[15:18] kingdom and patience of Jesus
[15:23] Christ was in the aisle that is called
[15:25] patmas for the word of God and for the
[15:27] testimony of Jesus Christ Christ I was
[15:29] in the spirit on the Lord's day and
[15:31] heard behind me a great voice as of a
[15:33] trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the
[15:37] first and the last and what thou see us
[15:39] write in a book and send it unto the
[15:41] seven churches which are in Asia unto
[15:44] Ephesus unto samna and unto pergamus and
[15:48] unto Tara and unto Sardis and unto
[15:51] Philadelphia and unto lady
[15:54] oia and I turned to see the
[15:56] voice that spake with me and be in
[15:59] turned I saw seven golden
[16:01] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[16:03] seven candlesticks one like unto the son
[16:05] of man clothed with a garment down to
[16:07] his foot and G about the pouch with a
[16:10] golden girdle his head and his hairs
[16:13] were white like wool as white as snow
[16:16] and his eyes were as of a flame of fire
[16:19] and his feet like undefined Bry as if
[16:21] they
[16:22] burn in a furnace and his voice as a
[16:25] sound of many Waters remember waters are
[16:28] people right
[16:29] and he had in his right hand Seven Stars
[16:32] and out of his mouth went a sharp
[16:34] two-edged sword and his countenance was
[16:37] as where the sun shineth in his strength
[16:40] and when I saw him I fell at his feet is
[16:42] dead and he said he laid his hand right
[16:44] hand upon me saying unto me fear not I
[16:47] am the first in the LI I am he that
[16:50] liveth and was dead and behold I am
[16:52] alive forever more amen and have the
[16:54] keys of hell and death we'll stop right
[16:58] there Lord Jesus we ask you to just
[17:00] bless us as we lord try to read your
[17:03] word and talk about you and we ask you
[17:06] that you'd come on the scene now speak
[17:08] to our hearts and our lives forgive our
[17:10] sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[17:13] and keep us in your grace and love in
[17:16] Jesus name amen you may be seated the
[17:19] Lord add his Blessing to the reading of
[17:22] the
[17:23] word now we be going through this is the
[17:27] reason I read over to this part uh we
[17:32] we'll be picking up this and bringing a
[17:34] few messages and and trying to connect
[17:37] it together you know because we've you
[17:40] remember how we're trying to do we're
[17:42] trying to start on paral
[17:46] realization and C cover Through the
[17:48] message out into perfect
[17:51] realization uh to understand where it is
[17:55] and trying to see our day and its hour
[18:00] now I've always told you if you want to
[18:02] find
[18:04] yourself we can't read in this part or
[18:08] that part you can say well this pertains
[18:10] to me that's fine but if you want to
[18:13] find yourself just read the book of
[18:15] Revelations the very book that we were
[18:17] told to stay out of is the very book
[18:21] that will carry us to the place if we'll
[18:24] read it and you'll see that the point
[18:27] I've tried to make to you for many many
[18:29] years probably
[18:31] 40 is one thing you don't see Jesus
[18:36] Christ in the Book of Revelations by
[18:42] himself he's
[18:44] always being revealed in another form
[18:47] another way or with the people or
[18:50] whatever you don't see him by himself
[18:54] you see him there uh speaking through
[18:57] the to the bride
[18:59] and even to the foolish virgins uh the
[19:02] Jews you find all of those things but
[19:04] you never find him by yourself that's an
[19:06] amazing thing to think of all of the
[19:09] things of the
[19:11] Bible that would turn out to be is the
[19:13] book they told us not to read you know
[19:15] the Book of Revelations and he said we
[19:17] couldn't understand it we see they were
[19:20] trying their best to keep us from
[19:22] reading
[19:23] it all right well when the prophet came
[19:25] and brought the message then you know
[19:28] you know now we can read it and
[19:30] understand what it's talking about and
[19:33] we can find ourselves remember that's
[19:35] what we're trying to do because the
[19:37] prophet you know he said it like this he
[19:39] said when the bride realizes who she is
[19:42] and what she's here
[19:44] for she would be an invincible Army
[19:47] nothing can stand in her way a Rapture
[19:50] will come right why because the bride
[19:54] will realize who she is and that's the
[19:56] way that I've tried to preach it that
[19:58] that Martin Luther realized that just
[20:01] shall live by
[20:02] faith and it became a reality Hallelujah
[20:05] and it converted the
[20:07] world all right you know because it was
[20:10] the word of the hour well each ages had
[20:13] the word of their day and their hour
[20:15] like in the church ages The Seven Ages
[20:17] and it's each one name coming down and
[20:21] each one has a
[20:23] part all right see but then in the end
[20:26] time we're to come down to the end of it
[20:28] all
[20:30] all right like we we covered you know
[20:32] the partial to the perfect we talked
[20:34] about the uh the the grain of
[20:38] wheat as as being the one that went into
[20:41] the ground and would be restored in the
[20:43] last days and it doesn't make it us any
[20:47] different because the age we're
[20:49] in it doesn't make us special it makes
[20:52] him special all right cuz he's in the
[20:56] midst of the seven golden and
[20:58] candlesticks which means he's just as
[21:00] much in one as in as he in is in the
[21:03] other now he might not be able to
[21:05] manifest
[21:06] himself but that doesn't have anything
[21:08] to do with it because he's there doing
[21:12] doing it in in the day all right then as
[21:15] we brought it up from the grain of wheat
[21:17] that went into the ground is to come
[21:19] back to the original
[21:21] grain again in the end time before
[21:25] Rapture could come amen all right then
[21:27] we went through the uh talking about the
[21:31] the new birth and or bringing us to a a
[21:34] birth and bringing us to the Sons and
[21:36] Daughters of a living God and and then
[21:38] brought it down and tried to cover the
[21:40] things the prophet said about the bride
[21:44] and how that she would be the fullness
[21:46] of the godhead bodily am all right now
[21:51] remember you leave Luther out of it it's
[21:53] not the fullness right you leave Wesley
[21:56] out of it you leave isusa street right
[21:58] you leave any age out and you're not in
[22:01] fullness amen all right the fullness of
[22:03] the godhead bodily would be the entire
[22:06] bride right all right now as that would
[22:10] be being brought out see it would be
[22:12] coming further and further over to show
[22:15] it as the bride in the end time yes
[22:19] because the bride in the end time is to
[22:21] make that manifest right just like
[22:24] John you know was chosen to go to patmas
[22:29] right and going to patmas to write the
[22:32] Book of Revelations to bring it unto us
[22:35] then he was also chosen or taken up all
[22:39] right being one
[22:41] man he represented the entire bride amen
[22:46] all right so now that's what we're
[22:47] trying to get to showing the grain of
[22:51] wheat you know it's not going to be no
[22:53] good you can't go out when you say we're
[22:56] in the wheat we're we're back to the
[22:58] original so we don't need anything else
[23:01] underneath us you go cut your wheat down
[23:03] at that stage and when it's green and or
[23:06] your corn or whatever you want to you
[23:09] got to leave it and it's got its
[23:12] purpose until the time comes that it can
[23:16] return to the original grain that could
[23:19] be planted into the ground we never
[23:22] raised much wheat in our life but we
[23:25] raised a lot of corn and that corn was
[23:27] left on the stalk even though we would
[23:30] cut the the top off of it and the silk
[23:33] things part you know getting it down we'
[23:36] we do all of it but yet it stayed there
[23:39] remained in the
[23:40] field until it was time to gather it
[23:44] because if you went out and gathered it
[23:46] too quick put it in the barn it's going
[23:50] to mold M you right so you got to wait
[23:56] see we talk about a harvest well you
[23:58] don't put the the combine in to harvest
[24:01] green wheat right it's got to be dried
[24:05] ready another words plantable wheat
[24:07] right plantable corn all right see
[24:11] because you don't you go out there and
[24:12] you go to town you buy you a goodie or
[24:14] corn you take it home you boil it you
[24:16] say man that's good that's good it is
[24:18] but you can't plant
[24:21] it wrong
[24:23] stage wrong part now what did we cover
[24:26] then in the last part
[24:29] talking about
[24:32] dispensations all right but brother
[24:34] brandom says I'm a dispensationalist he
[24:37] said God's a
[24:39] dispensationalist all
[24:42] right and then he turns around and other
[24:44] messages and he said I'm not much on
[24:47] being a
[24:49] dispensationalist well as I told you you
[24:51] won't find the word dispensationalist in
[24:54] Webster's Dictionary you might find it
[24:57] on this modern day stuff because it's
[25:00] not there
[25:02] but the point I believe he's getting at
[25:06] is what it means by
[25:09] dispensations that's why he would say he
[25:11] believed in a dispensation but then say
[25:13] he didn't believe in dispensation that's
[25:15] right all now you take the word
[25:18] dispensation and it'll turn out to be
[25:21] stewardship right and stuff like that
[25:24] all right now that would not be what you
[25:26] would want to bring in into view as to
[25:31] understanding the corn of wheat or those
[25:34] things or the fullness of the godhead
[25:36] bodily Etc you you wouldn't get the
[25:38] right understanding even though you
[25:40] would be right in the stewardship the
[25:43] great that's wonderful but if you're
[25:45] dealing with dispensation just as
[25:48] stewardship see it wouldn't come out but
[25:50] if you're dealing with dispensations as
[25:52] manifestations or as times it doesn't
[25:56] say the dispensation of the Gentile
[25:59] it says the when the fullness of the
[26:01] Gentiles has come all right see then the
[26:04] prophet said see there's a dispensation
[26:07] of the Gentiles all right see then that
[26:10] way we we come to that place to to have
[26:13] an understanding of even like something
[26:17] that would look contrary from here to
[26:20] there you know and and doing those
[26:23] things then if you'll give a little time
[26:25] it'll come together and make a beautiful
[26:28] picture
[26:29] because he was a prophet you know and
[26:32] God was using him to bring the message
[26:34] all right so then the
[26:38] dispensations you
[26:40] know he came in three as we were last
[26:43] covered in the last message he came in
[26:45] three sons names Son of God Son of Man
[26:48] son of
[26:49] David all right and then in doing that
[26:53] then we can see that you pull a put a
[26:56] dispensation with each part of it you
[26:58] know and it'll come out to right because
[27:00] like there's a dispensation of the Old
[27:02] Testament there's a dispensation of the
[27:05] New Testament all right there's a time
[27:07] of the Old Testament a time of the New
[27:09] Testament all right see then he was on
[27:12] Earth he was son of man he never
[27:16] declared himself to be the Son of God
[27:19] but yet that's who he was right you know
[27:21] he was born that all right but he didn't
[27:24] declare it in public
[27:27] announcement of himself because he was
[27:31] manifesting or in the dispensation or
[27:34] time of the son of
[27:37] man which was the prophet all right son
[27:41] of man then we covered over how in that
[27:45] like I ask you to read the intervail or
[27:47] excuse me the unveil that's a good one
[27:49] too intervail but all of them is good
[27:51] but I ask you to read the unveiling of
[27:53] God and and the Mighty God unveiled and
[27:56] and to study that and listen listen to
[27:58] what the prophet had to
[28:01] say and he said he came as son of
[28:05] man and they crucified him all right cuz
[28:09] see you couldn't kill Son of
[28:11] God all right and we know for sure You'
[28:13] never tried to in any way kill the son
[28:16] of David because he's going to be ruler
[28:21] over there and there's no death to the
[28:22] son of David amen there's death to the
[28:24] son of man there's rejection to the Son
[28:28] of God right but there you don't have
[28:31] anything whatsoever when you come to son
[28:34] of David you don't have rejections you
[28:36] don't have now sure Israel turned him
[28:38] down but he wasn't coming to them as son
[28:41] of David you remember th son of David
[28:45] well he he wouldn't even right he
[28:47] wouldn't talk to the lady you know not
[28:50] only because it that she was a gentile
[28:53] but because that was not the
[28:55] dispensation or the time all right so
[28:58] came as son of
[29:00] man and he died as son of man then he
[29:03] came back the prophet says on the
[29:05] unveiling of God paragraph
[29:08] 68-71 that he came then as Son of God
[29:12] down through the seven Church
[29:15] ages see that would be a dispensation
[29:18] right or a times right all right see
[29:22] then he died son of
[29:24] man remember we gave him he rose Son of
[29:27] God he come down to the church ages as
[29:30] Son of God but then in the last
[29:34] age we see that a a little man as I said
[29:38] Paul and him didn't speak of Son of
[29:41] Man Peter and John and those writings uh
[29:45] you know now Matthew Mark Luke and John
[29:47] but that was the writing of the time
[29:49] that Christ was here and what he was
[29:50] doing but they didn't Paul didn't go
[29:53] into the revelation of son of man maybe
[29:56] he understood but he never dealt with
[29:58] those things but isn't it odd that here
[30:01] come brother brandom
[30:05] immediately there in the 40s he begin to
[30:08] talk about son of man son of man
[30:11] well it it was something was transpiring
[30:17] amen all right a dispensation was
[30:20] changing that's right from Son of God to
[30:25] Son of
[30:26] Man you know like I told you you know it
[30:30] took me listening about seven times to
[30:33] the unveiling of God to really get it
[30:35] years ago to get the real layout because
[30:38] see you go from son of man Son of God
[30:42] Son of
[30:44] David and you you you you can't control
[30:48] that and keep it in the right place so
[30:50] you go from son of
[30:52] man died for our
[30:54] sins Son of God on the day of Pentecost
[30:59] seven Church ages but he's to come back
[31:01] in the last days as the son of man
[31:05] again then he goes as son of David
[31:09] because you can't go from from Son of
[31:11] God to son of
[31:13] David you know I know you don't think
[31:15] the way I do and I'm glad of it but God
[31:18] would all be messed up
[31:21] but so you can't go from that
[31:24] dispensation you got to go with the
[31:26] dispensations are the times the
[31:29] Revelation or whatever you want to
[31:32] bring you got to to go that way so then
[31:36] you got to go from son of man Son of God
[31:40] Son of Man son of David and like I said
[31:43] people oh they're quick you know oh
[31:45] that's four brother Dale that's an
[31:47] antichrist
[31:49] number you don't read but it's also
[31:54] restoration
[31:56] number amen
[31:58] you got four you got the K War pal war
[32:02] and Locus caterpillar that's right you
[32:04] got your white horse red horse Pale
[32:06] Horse you know black horse Pale Horse
[32:08] and all you got four yeah that's good
[32:10] but keep reading you got to have the
[32:12] combat to go with
[32:15] that canor pal worm Locust caterpillar
[32:18] Luther Wesley Pentecost and the word
[32:21] what was it lion ox man
[32:24] Eagle so we think we're so smart when we
[32:27] can quot see but it doesn't keep you
[32:30] lined up all right but you have to
[32:33] listen see because the prophet won't say
[32:37] the order of say son of God Son of Man
[32:41] Son of God Son of Man son of David it's
[32:43] just in one
[32:44] paragraph it's in the
[32:47] message of the way it comes because it's
[32:50] got to come that way all right but he
[32:52] Son of God down to the ages that was the
[32:55] dispensation right all right then what
[32:58] does he turn out to
[33:02] do he uses the word dispensation on
[33:05] paragraph 65 so he could not call
[33:07] himself the Son of
[33:10] God because it wasn't that
[33:14] dispensation he was the son of man
[33:16] prophesying to fulfill you know and to
[33:20] reveal all right reveal
[33:23] what a trial paragraph
[33:26] 235 he was revealed in the church ages
[33:34] right but the
[33:36] church has put him
[33:38] out okay then he would be revealed as
[33:42] son of
[33:45] man God
[33:48] manifested amongst the human beings like
[33:52] it was then son of man Prophet all right
[33:56] wonderful Here Comes
[33:58] what here come a prophet in our day to
[34:02] stand there and have the ministry of
[34:05] Elijah of the ministry of the Lord Jesus
[34:08] Christ to manifest in life in reality
[34:13] the son of man but he was not the son of
[34:16] man he was a son of
[34:18] man the son of man is the Lord Jesus
[34:21] Christ a son of man was the prophet all
[34:24] right but he to return back in this day
[34:29] as son of
[34:31] man then he can go as son of David all
[34:35] right he would be revealed
[34:39] where the unveiling of God paragraph
[34:42] 184 the Son of God see that's where he
[34:45] come through the ages he's put out of
[34:47] the church how he is revealed as son of
[34:52] man how that the church is to be put in
[34:55] order and everything for the nice days
[34:58] no Creed nor denomination absolutely the
[35:02] word living in the individual am all
[35:05] right so where's it going
[35:07] to just reminding you of these things
[35:10] that that we used all right paragraph
[35:14] 3:18 of the unveiling of
[35:17] God he says that seed has got to be
[35:21] gerti none outside of that outside of
[35:24] them messages will ever come to life
[35:29] and outside of the this message of the
[35:31] hour the messages he brought will come
[35:34] to life none of it won't and then you
[35:36] can say messages you can even say Luther
[35:39] Wesley Pentecost they will come to life
[35:41] in the last days but what would it be
[35:44] the son of man the grain that went into
[35:47] the ground he said get the
[35:52] message it would come back to the son of
[35:56] man the grain of wheat that went into
[35:59] the ground all right so we use the grain
[36:03] of wheat come up with it and we use the
[36:06] fullness of the godhead bodily coming up
[36:08] with that then now we use dispensations
[36:12] coming up that way now we're going to go
[36:14] into the son of man we won't get very
[36:17] much of it today but we'll get there
[36:20] eventually but just think about
[36:24] it in the seal book paragraph 354 the
[36:28] four
[36:29] seal said we could just give you
[36:31] scripture after scripture see that the
[36:34] last age is to be a prophetic message to
[36:39] the church calling them back to the
[36:44] original word
[36:45] right see the son of man was the grain
[36:48] that went into the
[36:49] ground all right so now it had to be son
[36:53] of man
[36:55] again proving his word who is this son
[36:57] of man is the word I've got another one
[37:00] on that's the rising of the sun where he
[37:03] said in the beginning was the word word
[37:05] was with God he quotes it you know all
[37:07] right but now get to the point and then
[37:09] we'll get on to the message proving his
[37:11] word he says who is this son of man the
[37:17] word the
[37:20] word where's that word to be made
[37:24] manifest
[37:25] right where's that word word to be made
[37:28] manifest
[37:30] am in the
[37:32] bride right where else can it be made
[37:35] manifest in this
[37:40] day all right because Son of God can't
[37:43] do
[37:46] it that was what he was through the
[37:48] church
[37:49] ages right he going to come back as son
[37:52] of
[37:54] man the original grain that went into
[37:57] the ground is to come back to the
[38:01] original which in other words put it in
[38:02] plain language the word that was ate
[38:05] down in the Dark Ages is going to come
[38:08] back in its Purity and even in this
[38:13] day will
[38:16] surpass the revelation of the Apostles
[38:19] amen because they dealt with Son of
[38:23] God but not with son of man because they
[38:27] were not a dispensation to deal
[38:30] with you
[38:32] never noticed
[38:35] that in the days of Wesley when he come
[38:37] along with preaching
[38:40] sanctification all the songs was about
[38:42] the
[38:44] blood right why because he believed and
[38:48] it was taught that the blood saved
[38:52] you all right but we're not saved by the
[38:55] blood we're kept saved by it
[38:58] but his message of sanctification was
[39:00] right
[39:02] right because he taught it correctly all
[39:05] right but what is to happen
[39:10] then then we come up to a little word
[39:12] the prophet would call on the unveiling
[39:15] of God the Mighty God unveiled who is
[39:17] this mesic many many messages did he
[39:21] would speak of a little thing called
[39:26] imorph and that IM morphe would mean
[39:29] change in
[39:32] form they're in Colossians right in the
[39:35] form of God thought it not rather to be
[39:37] equal with God in morphe all
[39:40] right but now I said a moment ago who is
[39:44] to make manifest in this last
[39:48] days Jesus Christ is not to come back to
[39:52] earth in a physical
[39:56] body right right we meet him in the
[40:01] air if he came back to a physical body
[40:04] then he have two bodies CU he'd have
[40:06] that body and then we'd be his body so
[40:08] it would mess up everything and that
[40:09] won't work so he's not coming
[40:14] physically so then who's going to be the
[40:17] last IM morphe of God because that's why
[40:20] we're not Trinity and we don't believe
[40:23] in God in three
[40:25] persons neither are we
[40:28] Oneness to try to say that Jesus was the
[40:31] life form of
[40:34] God cuz that's one that's Doctrine
[40:36] that's why it's one like a finger all
[40:38] right but he's to be IM morphe
[40:42] where in the
[40:45] bride right IM morphe in the
[40:50] bride okay now see then what is he doing
[40:54] he's just changing his form
[40:58] I gave them these but we don't have to
[40:59] read it because everybody knows it who
[41:01] is this
[41:02] mesic God in morphe mask in the pillar
[41:05] of
[41:06] fire god in morphe in a man called
[41:11] Jesus God IM
[41:14] morphe in his church right amen God
[41:18] above us God With Us God in us the
[41:21] condescending of God he says all right
[41:25] so when then we are to be the life for
[41:27] form of God to the Gentile
[41:30] dispensation then he'll go to
[41:33] Israel and manifest himself to them and
[41:37] I believe too that when he goes there
[41:39] he'll have to manifest himself as Son of
[41:41] God because he brings him salvation then
[41:44] he'll manifest himself through two
[41:47] prophets which would deal with son of
[41:49] man then he'll deal with son of David
[41:53] right amen because he's going to the
[41:55] Millennium and see but in the Gentiles
[41:58] we are the last form of God the last IM
[42:03] morphe all right and if it's the last in
[42:07] morphe would be correct then according
[42:09] to the invisible Union of the bride of
[42:11] Christ paragraph
[42:13] 221 can't you see where we're
[42:16] standing he's talking about everything
[42:18] left to shook left a hus left this left
[42:21] that can't you see where we're
[42:23] standing life is in the grain again
[42:29] but where's it
[42:31] at life is in the grain again what is it
[42:34] just exactly like the same grain that
[42:37] went into the
[42:39] ground the same Lord
[42:41] Jesus in The Bride form the same power
[42:46] same church same thing same word
[42:51] amen
[42:53] now but here's what we get tied up in I
[42:57] don't believe it's
[42:59] here I don't believe it's here like it
[43:03] was go ahead that's your
[43:07] choice but
[43:11] somebody is going to confess
[43:14] it and it's going to
[43:18] happen but yet we think it's not
[43:22] happening like I
[43:23] said you let the dead raised you let the
[43:26] sick healed let things happen well that
[43:29] could have been you know probably didn't
[43:30] die right brother Gary guy told him just
[43:33] the other day that when he said the Lord
[43:36] touched him delivered him from that well
[43:37] you know I mean you know I mean these
[43:40] things
[43:44] happen but you see what I've always said
[43:47] too if you let that blabber mouth that's
[43:50] talking like that and forgive me just
[43:54] plain the one that's talking about that
[43:57] God's not here like he used to
[43:59] be to me it's a blabber
[44:02] mouth because according to my Bible he's
[44:06] the same yesterday today and forever
[44:09] that's right
[44:11] am he was the same in Luther's age
[44:15] that's right but nobody couldn't believe
[44:17] it right that's it he was the same in
[44:21] Wesley's age nobody couldn't believe
[44:24] it why can't we believe it somebody is
[44:27] going to have to before it can be made
[44:31] manifest as I said about Martin Luther
[44:34] even though he preached a great message
[44:37] that didn't make the Catholic Church
[44:39] upset that's right it was when the
[44:44] people begin to believe what he said and
[44:49] they begin to bring it back and live
[44:52] it just shall live by faith the Catholic
[44:55] Church got it set in
[44:58] you see what I'm talking about but see
[45:01] who are we to judge what is to
[45:07] be you see we we're looking for things
[45:10] to happen when the prophet will say it's
[45:15] here well brother Dale that was only to
[45:17] him I agree with you at that time it was
[45:20] only to him
[45:21] that's I agree with
[45:24] you but now I believe that's got to be
[45:26] made manifest
[45:28] somewhere amen am but you see we've
[45:32] heard so much false until you talk about
[45:35] the bride be in the fullness of the
[45:36] godhead
[45:38] body I don't see
[45:40] it you're
[45:42] blind you're lady oia right
[45:46] amen that's my that's your choice to
[45:49] make I'm not just preaching out there
[45:52] I'm talking in Lula too so all right but
[45:55] you see church then
[45:57] it's got to come back he said can't you
[46:00] see where we're
[46:05] standing well yeah you know what biggest
[46:08] portion of us wouldn't even standing
[46:10] when he made the statement I mean a lot
[46:12] wouldn't
[46:14] right but does that change it
[46:20] no see they're talking about now about
[46:22] this Blood Moon and all I don't
[46:25] understand all of it I just know one
[46:29] thing the Bible talks about the Moon
[46:32] turning to blood right right you know
[46:35] what brother rown
[46:36] said he said I can show you where that
[46:40] happened well ain't nobody ever seen the
[46:43] moon turn to
[46:47] blood
[46:49] well who's the liar you or brother
[46:53] brandom cuz he said I can show you where
[46:55] it's already taken place
[46:57] now I can't find that I've never been
[47:00] able to find it if you can I'd love to
[47:02] have it you
[47:04] know but I know what he said but see
[47:07] we're looking for things to
[47:11] happen he said I I have heard but now I
[47:14] see that's what I was telling you in
[47:16] that message I was bringing about the
[47:18] grain of wheat the corn study the
[47:21] message from 65
[47:23] 64 and 65 all the way through and every
[47:27] message just about it he's talking about
[47:29] the grain of
[47:31] wheat and the return to the
[47:34] original
[47:35] right all right watch what he says on I
[47:40] have heard but now I see paragraph
[47:42] 186 go ahead and run that one
[47:45] brother number one B I've had to put a
[47:48] lot of B's ones and B's and A's and C's
[47:51] in this
[47:53] today but the grain comes out of that
[47:58] shook weak coming down they
[48:01] organize they kill themselves there's
[48:04] where they
[48:05] die there are stalks but the wheat has
[48:09] come up through there and now it's
[48:13] be to form in the bride
[48:18] form
[48:20] right but
[48:21] see he says the one that fell into the
[48:25] ground but you see we want to talk about
[48:27] and you can talk to the people and
[48:29] they'll agree with you in a hurry that
[48:31] son of man was brother
[48:34] randam you know oh yeah we saw it back
[48:37] there but we don't see it no more now
[48:40] I've told you I've preached this 40
[48:42] something years and I'm still saying it
[48:45] I
[48:45] believe the ministry that was in brother
[48:48] brandham is in the Bride of Jesus Christ
[48:50] around the world whether you believe it
[48:53] or not I don't care I believe that the
[48:56] ministry that was in the Lord Jesus
[48:59] Christ is in the bride around the
[49:03] world but it's not in no one individual
[49:06] person no
[49:09] more it's in the Bride of Jesus Christ
[49:13] so let's just make manifest our
[49:16] part bride form that's what we're
[49:18] talking about tonight bride
[49:22] form God's last IM
[49:25] Mory
[49:29] and when he does he gets into the church
[49:31] ages that's why we read from one
[49:34] up and he covers seven Church
[49:38] ages and he covers how that Christ is in
[49:41] the midst of
[49:43] that all right then he comes up to about
[49:47] verse 11 and starts making an
[49:50] outstanding statement go ahead and pull
[49:51] that
[49:53] brother so what does he
[49:55] say
[49:57] he is already
[49:59] covered down through time and when he
[50:01] gets to the aisle of patmas he speaks to
[50:04] John to let him know who he is that's
[50:06] why we read verse one down to know who
[50:08] it is this is red letter if you got a
[50:11] red letter bible you know it's red
[50:12] letter of him talking that was Jesus
[50:16] personally all right now look what he
[50:21] says verse 11 says I am Alpha and Omega
[50:25] the first and the last
[50:27] what thou see us write in a book and
[50:29] send it send it unto the seven churches
[50:31] which are in Asia under Ephesus under SM
[50:34] of per and I turned to see the voice
[50:38] that spake with me now you know we've
[50:40] been through that he didn't say he
[50:42] turned to see the person but that's what
[50:44] he was trying to
[50:45] do he knew the
[50:50] voice this voice spoke to John John knew
[50:54] that voice that's right it's the hardest
[50:56] thing in the world world for me to
[50:57] disguise this old voice I
[50:59] got 99% of the people that's ever talked
[51:03] to me on the phone the next time they do
[51:05] it oh hey Brother
[51:07] D I guess there's not a lot of them got
[51:10] an old voice like I've
[51:12] got good or bad
[51:16] but he didn't turn to see the person he
[51:19] knew who the person
[51:23] was
[51:24] right he knew the person
[51:28] he had ate and slept with him for three
[51:30] and 1/2 years in his
[51:34] ministry he knew that was
[51:38] Jesus
[51:40] right so he turned to see The Voice the
[51:43] prophet says the voice and the person is
[51:47] the
[51:49] same so there stood the Lord Jesus
[51:54] Christ that down through there as we
[51:57] went from verse one on over a good bit
[52:00] of it is red letter which means the
[52:02] person of God is speaking
[52:06] right and when he comes to this he's
[52:08] saying I'm the alpha and
[52:11] omega well it could not be anything
[52:14] else who would you be
[52:17] expecting if you heard the voice that
[52:19] could say
[52:22] that I can't say I'm Alpha and Omega you
[52:25] can't say you're Alpha and Omega
[52:28] John knew there was only one person that
[52:29] could say I am Alpha and Omega the same
[52:32] one that stood on the earth and
[52:34] said I am the
[52:37] word I am the son of
[52:41] man but I said now they didn't talk too
[52:44] much about son of man down Through the
[52:48] Ages so now we're going to
[52:52] see a picture of the last IM morphic
[52:57] of
[52:59] God and the surprise to
[53:04] John was where he seen it
[53:07] at like to Paul on the road to Damascus
[53:11] I am Jesus whom th
[53:13] persecuted Paul never persecuted Jesus
[53:16] there's no record he ever went against
[53:18] him where he was at I don't know what he
[53:20] was doing I don't
[53:22] know but he was persecuting the
[53:24] Christians and the Christians with Jesus
[53:27] amen all right so now watching and I
[53:29] turned to see the voice that spake with
[53:32] me in being turned I saw seven golden
[53:35] candlesticks that was no problem CU he
[53:38] just got through being explained to
[53:41] him he had just got through being
[53:44] explained of seven golden
[53:47] candlesticks right right but the
[53:50] beautiful part is what he said then and
[53:53] in the midst of seven candlesticks one
[53:56] one likee unto the son of
[54:01] man now John
[54:04] probably begin to
[54:07] calculate and he said I know the
[54:11] voice I know this is
[54:15] Jesus and I know he kept referring to
[54:19] himself a son of
[54:23] man then it all begins to tie together
[54:28] as he begins to see
[54:30] it and in the midst of the seven golden
[54:32] candlesticks seven candles one like unto
[54:35] the son of
[54:37] man clothed with a garment down to the
[54:40] foot and G about the PS with a golden
[54:43] girdle all
[54:47] right he's giving the description of
[54:52] himself but look where he's at right
[54:57] this one that says the son of
[55:01] man he's in the midst of the seven
[55:03] golden
[55:04] candlesticks but it's beautiful now
[55:06] we'll get to it more Sunday because it
[55:08] says one
[55:13] like one
[55:15] like the son of man which means that
[55:19] you're referring to that this is not the
[55:25] person
[55:26] of
[55:28] Jesus that is being
[55:30] shown it's Jesus in his next
[55:34] form so it's one like where do we get
[55:37] there Sunday way the other day was on
[55:39] the Genesis he likes that likeness and
[55:42] things way do we get there we'll maybe
[55:44] pick up a few
[55:46] points one like unto the son of
[55:50] man then he's given a description of
[55:53] himself his head and his hairs were
[55:55] white like wool white as snow eyes we as
[55:59] a flame of
[56:00] fire his feet like a Define brce if they
[56:03] were burned in a furnace and his
[56:07] voice as the sound of many
[56:11] Waters you go a little further in the
[56:13] Book of Revelation you find
[56:15] out Waters means people that's
[56:20] right right this is not a a point of
[56:25] seeing just Jesus
[56:30] standing it's a description of
[56:34] Jesus but where he's at right and what
[56:37] he's
[56:39] doing it's his IM morphe it's him
[56:41] changing
[56:43] form
[56:45] right and he had his right hand Seven
[56:48] Stars out of his mouth when a sharp
[56:50] two-edged sword count us like the sun
[56:53] shineth and strength when I saw him I
[56:55] fell his feet feet is dead he laid his
[56:58] right hand upon me saying unto me fear
[57:01] not I am the first and the
[57:03] last
[57:08] now this was
[57:10] not a
[57:12] prophet go ahead and pull
[57:15] up we already A 1 C 1 D all right one D
[57:21] I added these in to where I wouldn't
[57:23] have to repr
[57:24] preach the last service I preached two
[57:27] weeks ago all right but I didn't finish
[57:29] my notes so I just added them in and
[57:34] picked up the point so roll it on up to
[57:36] where we can see because this is the
[57:37] main thing to the last of it of what
[57:39] we're getting
[57:40] to is I'm know alpha and omega beginning
[57:43] and end sayith the
[57:45] Lord which is which was and which is to
[57:49] come Hebrews 138 right who is he what's
[57:53] this revelation of
[57:57] Jesus
[57:59] Christ and here he's not a
[58:04] prophet
[58:07] now here he is the almighty
[58:12] God
[58:15] now now here he's not a
[58:25] prophet now I don't have time to preach
[58:27] on it so I'll just say it and go on and
[58:28] then forget it you've heard it many many
[58:33] times one day the
[58:35] sunship in our words of
[58:38] using is to
[58:41] terminate that God may be all in all the
[58:46] son is to become subject exactly what
[58:48] the scripture
[58:50] say see here he's not dealing
[58:54] with what we thought
[58:57] think he's not a prophet that would be
[59:00] automatic son of
[59:02] man right but he says he's not a
[59:09] prophet beautiful
[59:14] story see he's not a prophet who is he
[59:18] here he is the almighty God
[59:23] manifested Alpha to Omega um from A to
[59:27] Z you know there goes that computer
[59:30] running a brother Dale you don't
[59:32] understand brother R said he's Alpha and
[59:34] Omega and nothing in
[59:37] between I've heard Services preached on
[59:39] that and then they said Luther and
[59:41] Wesley and them didn't have nothing
[59:44] cuz well he says he's Alpha and Omega
[59:47] and all this in
[59:49] between what's he meaning when he says
[59:51] and nothing
[59:53] between he's only referencing to the the
[59:56] ministry that would be in the fullness
[59:58] in Alpha and the ministry to be in the
[1:00:00] fullness of Omega that's right he's not
[1:00:02] saying that he's not down here the Bible
[1:00:04] declares he is
[1:00:06] amen but you see we like to get those
[1:00:08] little pet peeves and we run a Doctrine
[1:00:11] an idea and and the people poor people
[1:00:14] just sat there and holler
[1:00:16] amen right because they don't know what
[1:00:19] the truth is that's right all right but
[1:00:22] you see he's not a
[1:00:24] prophet he's not a prophet at this
[1:00:29] form that's why it says one
[1:00:32] like unto the son of
[1:00:37] man one liken to the son of
[1:00:42] man what form is
[1:00:44] that that he
[1:00:47] sees go ahead with
[1:00:51] 3B oh wait a minute Church
[1:00:54] a let me let me make sure I'm getting on
[1:00:57] the right okay they're right two all
[1:01:00] right seven Church
[1:01:02] ages look what it
[1:01:05] says speaking of this what we just read
[1:01:08] and in the midst of seven golden candles
[1:01:09] S one liken the son of man what one like
[1:01:13] him who was
[1:01:16] this his
[1:01:19] bride now do you need any
[1:01:23] more who is that it's in Revelations
[1:01:27] 1 11 12 13
[1:01:32] Etc who is this the prophet said his
[1:01:35] bride one like him what does it say or
[1:01:39] mean one like
[1:01:42] him we'll get to that
[1:01:45] likeness more later clothed and all the
[1:01:49] different dipped and but G about the
[1:01:52] PS not a man a woman
[1:01:58] right what a golden girdle the gospel
[1:02:02] what is this golden girdle the gospel
[1:02:04] that held the power and glory of God
[1:02:06] over the body of Christ Oh what a
[1:02:09] beautiful picture we got here under
[1:02:11] consideration
[1:02:14] right and what does it
[1:02:17] do go to 2A cuz I did add this then I
[1:02:20] didn't remember using
[1:02:23] it which is paragraph 4 49 Church age
[1:02:26] book patmas Vision turned to see the
[1:02:29] voice that spake unto me he turned to
[1:02:31] see The Voice John does not say that he
[1:02:33] turned to see the one whose voice he
[1:02:38] heard he knew who it was but he turned
[1:02:41] to see the
[1:02:45] voice oh I like that he turned to see
[1:02:49] the voice the voice and the person are
[1:02:52] one and the same Jesus is the word
[1:02:57] what who is this you're
[1:02:59] seeing one liken the son of man in
[1:03:02] bright
[1:03:04] form the son of
[1:03:06] man all
[1:03:10] right go on to the next
[1:03:13] one number three why we're not a
[1:03:15] denomination paragraph
[1:03:20] 180 now if you notice in Revelations 1
[1:03:23] we find Jesus standing in the seven
[1:03:25] Church ages seven golden
[1:03:28] candlesticks when he turned and saw one
[1:03:32] like the son of man standing clothed
[1:03:35] with a how was it it was a
[1:03:39] bride standing in the candlesticks draw
[1:03:43] out now how much more do you
[1:03:48] need it was a
[1:03:52] bride how much more would we need to try
[1:03:55] to
[1:03:56] understand go to the next Israel and the
[1:04:01] church 53 paragraph 1
[1:04:05] 58 Revelations the first
[1:04:08] chapter and John when John saw him
[1:04:11] standing one like unto the son of man
[1:04:14] standing in the midst of the seven
[1:04:15] golden candlesticks which was the seven
[1:04:18] Church
[1:04:19] ages just to make sure we don't lose
[1:04:21] that
[1:04:23] point right
[1:04:28] now before you get too far in your
[1:04:31] thinking and run ahead of
[1:04:35] me just hold on a little bit we'll try
[1:04:38] to get
[1:04:39] there you know what you're thinking
[1:04:43] about because this is a beautiful
[1:04:48] picture that we have into
[1:04:52] view the last IM morphe of God the last
[1:04:56] form of God is in his bride before the G
[1:04:58] that's the ending of the Gentiles we go
[1:05:01] to meet him in the a all right so there
[1:05:04] should be no argument of chapter
[1:05:06] one of who this
[1:05:09] is but remember who it is it's not now
[1:05:14] watch my wording it's not the
[1:05:18] bride oh we just read it was listen it's
[1:05:23] God in his church the bride
[1:05:26] right he's revealing
[1:05:30] himself and where he's
[1:05:34] at he's glad to do
[1:05:38] that to show
[1:05:41] himself as to where he's at where he's
[1:05:44] manifesting
[1:05:46] himself in the book that were we were
[1:05:49] told not to
[1:05:50] read because we couldn't understand
[1:05:53] it can't you see that was a
[1:05:58] devil so it's the same old devil in this
[1:06:01] message well we can't understand this oh
[1:06:04] it looks like something over here and
[1:06:06] look like something over here and we
[1:06:08] don't know what this is and we don't
[1:06:09] know
[1:06:11] what I mean I'd just say the prophet was
[1:06:13] wrong the way I'd say it but of course
[1:06:16] they're not going to do that how many
[1:06:18] preachers are going to get up for well
[1:06:19] they are now far sorry they are now
[1:06:22] getting up and saying he's wrong you
[1:06:24] know what but they're still quoting sure
[1:06:26] I don't get
[1:06:28] that I mean I go say brother K is wrong
[1:06:31] I ain't going to quote
[1:06:33] him if I do I'm going to say this part
[1:06:36] is
[1:06:37] right but that other part ain't
[1:06:41] right
[1:06:43] no but you see that quote quote quote
[1:06:45] quote quote quote quote but it done said
[1:06:47] the prophet was
[1:06:50] wrong well he made the
[1:06:53] statement you can prove me wrong in one
[1:06:56] point then I'm
[1:06:59] wrong so evidently all of these things
[1:07:02] about proving him to be wrong must not
[1:07:05] be right you
[1:07:09] know and that's like we're talking about
[1:07:11] here because we're going to get into
[1:07:12] something on this reason I read this one
[1:07:14] in the middle to pause and give you a
[1:07:19] thought he described in the
[1:07:24] bride
[1:07:27] he's given a description of
[1:07:29] himself in his
[1:07:32] church one like unto the son of
[1:07:36] man heard about the paps he said see
[1:07:39] that's that's a woman that's not a man
[1:07:43] it's a
[1:07:45] woman but now let's cover a few more
[1:07:47] things that he
[1:07:49] shows while we're at this
[1:07:52] point let's talk about this paps and
[1:07:56] things a little
[1:07:58] deeper okay go ahead with
[1:08:02] 3C which is the patmas vision the
[1:08:05] message the patmas vision 1960 124e
[1:08:08] paragraph
[1:08:10] 183 come to the Ancient of Days whose
[1:08:13] hair was white as
[1:08:15] wool this is what going back in Daniel
[1:08:18] TR together right and John turned and he
[1:08:21] saw one like the son of man standing in
[1:08:24] the midst of the seven gold
[1:08:26] candlesticks with a Snow White hair am
[1:08:30] the
[1:08:31] judge watch
[1:08:33] him not gered around the
[1:08:37] waist but gered around the paps up here
[1:08:42] a
[1:08:46] judge a
[1:08:51] judge with the sight of the judge over
[1:08:53] his
[1:08:54] shoulder
[1:08:56] he stood with a golden pure holy refined
[1:08:58] girdle that held his righteousness his
[1:09:01] cover he was covered all the way to the
[1:09:03] feet watch the Sevenfold manifestation
[1:09:06] of his person and
[1:09:08] Glory so it's not just dealing with PS
[1:09:11] says it does to describe feminist or
[1:09:15] women you know or woman the bride the
[1:09:20] church but where is the judge
[1:09:24] at let's go a little deeper into this
[1:09:27] son of man lik un
[1:09:31] to you know that the world is going to
[1:09:33] be judged by
[1:09:38] you that's why it's good about the paps
[1:09:41] not to just show feminis alone but yet
[1:09:45] it does show
[1:09:47] feminis but it shows that the you've
[1:09:49] heard the prophet and if I got out of
[1:09:51] thinking
[1:09:52] here but he's not around the waste cuz
[1:09:56] that was time of
[1:09:59] service we said it's about his
[1:10:04] shoulders I thought we believe that the
[1:10:06] government was upon his shoulders
[1:10:08] talking of the church or
[1:10:13] bride see we're going to judge the world
[1:10:17] folks thought we're going to sit with
[1:10:20] him all
[1:10:23] right G to br around the PS up here a
[1:10:28] judge with the S over his
[1:10:31] shoulders showing his righteousness and
[1:10:33] pure Holiness going to the next one seal
[1:10:36] of God 1954 514 paragraph
[1:10:40] 45 describing the situation the standing
[1:10:43] where we
[1:10:46] at how that was seeing Jesus standing in
[1:10:50] the midst of the seven golden
[1:10:52] candlesticks to look upon as Jasper and
[1:10:54] arst Stone the B
[1:10:56] Benjamin the beginning and the ending
[1:10:58] Ruben and Benjamin see the seven
[1:11:01] candlesticks or seven lamp stand
[1:11:03] Standing There rainbow over it is a
[1:11:07] covenant and that is appeared and his
[1:11:09] voice was the voice of many
[1:11:12] Waters both Christ and the church
[1:11:15] speaking together with a golden girdle
[1:11:19] around about the breast part of the
[1:11:24] church
[1:11:27] covered over holding the gospel holding
[1:11:29] the righteousness of Christ over the
[1:11:31] church standing on the Bri
[1:11:35] Foundation right are you
[1:11:41] listening the point I'm getting at is
[1:11:43] not to just argue paps and other people
[1:11:46] would come up and say well you know paps
[1:11:48] is this and we can go to that because
[1:11:49] it's a golden girdle and it's body short
[1:11:51] all right that's what I'm reading we'll
[1:11:53] come to that point look at the next when
[1:11:55] patas Vision paragraph
[1:11:58] 167 tying his girdle around the
[1:12:02] waist meant that he was
[1:12:04] serving never tied it over his shoulder
[1:12:08] but here he comes out walking out with
[1:12:11] the girdle
[1:12:13] tied around the top with a SC over his
[1:12:18] shoulder gted about the PS the breast
[1:12:22] with a golden girdle gted up high what
[1:12:24] is it an attorney a
[1:12:27] judge a judge with his sash over his
[1:12:29] shoulders GED up here not down as a
[1:12:32] priest see that shows he wasn't in his
[1:12:35] priesthood
[1:12:36] now John went all the way into the
[1:12:39] Lord's day and saw him coming as the
[1:12:42] judge now do you believe what I said
[1:12:45] while ago that the Bible said that one
[1:12:47] day the son will be subject himself that
[1:12:49] God may be all in all it will not do
[1:12:53] away with sunship as we think
[1:12:55] right we will always know him
[1:12:59] as God made manifest in flesh we'll
[1:13:03] always know him as the Son of
[1:13:05] God but what does it mean it means he
[1:13:08] changes
[1:13:11] dispensations he keeps
[1:13:14] moving that God may be
[1:13:18] all in
[1:13:20] all so whatever the sunship being
[1:13:24] subject
[1:13:27] will have come to dealing
[1:13:29] with the bride of Jesus
[1:13:32] Christ being the
[1:13:39] judge think about
[1:13:45] it the next one spoken words Original
[1:13:47] Seed number two paragraph
[1:13:51] 373 and of his kingdom there shall be no
[1:13:54] end and the government shall be upon his
[1:13:57] what what you know what he said the
[1:14:01] congregation says shoulders that's part
[1:14:04] of his
[1:14:05] body my that's his body is it amen his
[1:14:09] shoulders is his body where is the
[1:14:12] government on the earth at in his
[1:14:19] body Saints shall judge the Earth right
[1:14:24] that's why you don't go to court with
[1:14:25] one another you know you don't argue
[1:14:29] about
[1:14:30] that you let the government take care of
[1:14:33] it now I'm I'm honest I've always just
[1:14:36] tried to be straight just without being
[1:14:38] so blunt
[1:14:39] and but that doesn't mean that you can't
[1:14:42] sue
[1:14:44] somebody well that's my brother well if
[1:14:48] it could be
[1:14:49] solved it's a good thing to solve it
[1:14:52] without going to
[1:14:53] court but you know what might wind up
[1:14:55] showing that neither one of us is
[1:14:59] Brothers
[1:15:01] right cuz naturally me on one side I'd
[1:15:04] say he ain't my brother so I take him to
[1:15:06] court of course on the other side he see
[1:15:07] he ain't my
[1:15:09] brother that's
[1:15:11] just best thing to do is try to solve
[1:15:15] something the Bible says age with your
[1:15:17] adversary
[1:15:19] quickly it didn't say compromise with
[1:15:21] him it didn't say do those things he
[1:15:23] said agree with him
[1:15:25] if you can settle
[1:15:27] something settle
[1:15:30] it you already said with juning us in
[1:15:33] that time in Richard nna when we to get
[1:15:35] a license to drive the van and we had to
[1:15:38] go to this uh thing of you know where
[1:15:42] it's really the kids go to because they
[1:15:43] lose their license and things well that
[1:15:46] was ours that we had to go through well
[1:15:48] the guy in there said or woman I think
[1:15:50] was made a good point said if you can
[1:15:54] keep that judge from being too
[1:15:58] strict you know you got this case and it
[1:16:00] means you go to this but if you can talk
[1:16:02] him into lowering it
[1:16:05] down just try the best you can to keep
[1:16:07] it going on record but once it's on
[1:16:10] record it's there so if the cop catches
[1:16:14] you be nice to
[1:16:16] him and you say I was running 72 in a
[1:16:20] 55 and he
[1:16:22] says well buddy you know what was you
[1:16:25] doing One S you could say well bless God
[1:16:28] I wasn't doing that you going to court
[1:16:31] it's on record talk to him and say
[1:16:33] listen sir is any way you can help me a
[1:16:36] little bit I'm just sorry I
[1:16:39] apologize for driving and you know if he
[1:16:42] lowers it down to about 65 you don't
[1:16:44] have to go to
[1:16:46] court that's just plain
[1:16:49] language all right it's just plain
[1:16:53] language
[1:16:56] the Saints are going to judge the
[1:16:58] Earth the government is upon the
[1:17:01] shoulders his body the government upon
[1:17:03] his shoulder that's part of the body and
[1:17:05] what is his Earthly strength God's
[1:17:08] Earthly strength is his word made flesh
[1:17:11] in his body here on
[1:17:13] Earth bringing to vce amen think about
[1:17:20] it think about it of what it is
[1:17:28] one more to just lay the
[1:17:32] foundation go to the last one number
[1:17:34] seven and we'll just lay it with the
[1:17:35] foundation we'll stop on this pick it up
[1:17:37] Sunday because if we continue any
[1:17:39] further we're going to progress into
[1:17:41] some things that I don't want to do
[1:17:42] without continuing it all right look at
[1:17:44] this one patas Vision page 52 Church age
[1:17:48] book patas Vision he's on Revelations
[1:17:51] 113 uh one in the midst of seven golden
[1:17:54] K like son of man there he
[1:17:57] stands one like unto the son of
[1:18:02] man as the jewel is beautified by the
[1:18:06] mounting of the
[1:18:08] ring so he is
[1:18:11] glorified in the midst of the
[1:18:14] churches it is the Lord's Day John sees
[1:18:17] him standing not as a
[1:18:20] priest but as a coming
[1:18:23] judge as a coming
[1:18:26] judge you know
[1:18:28] what we're going to sit on the throne
[1:18:30] with him amen and we're going to
[1:18:35] judge but you know what I love about
[1:18:39] that it's not going to be us that's
[1:18:42] being
[1:18:42] judged amen there is a judgment of Deeds
[1:18:45] Done in the body that out to be
[1:18:47] straightened up one of these
[1:18:50] days but there's no judgment of whether
[1:18:53] we decide eternal life or not
[1:18:55] that's decided by your new
[1:18:58] birth and if you have the new
[1:19:01] birth no matter if you're just a born
[1:19:03] again and go to Rapture that Split
[1:19:05] Second whatever you're not going to be
[1:19:08] we found out a baby you're not going to
[1:19:10] be this you're not going to be old we're
[1:19:12] all going to be young and we're all
[1:19:14] going to sit on the throne with him
[1:19:19] amen that's why in The Book of
[1:19:21] Revelations it's showing you a beautiful
[1:19:23] picture not a
[1:19:27] prophet we read it not a
[1:19:30] prophet but God in his church and what
[1:19:34] he thinks of
[1:19:36] her you get over to the end of the book
[1:19:38] of Revelation you'll find John his Wade
[1:19:41] was in the other day
[1:19:43] there 21 right in
[1:19:46] there or somebody was preaching on it
[1:19:48] just
[1:19:50] recently John is describing the
[1:19:53] bride
[1:19:55] and look like he's describing the city
[1:19:58] and John is describing the city and look
[1:20:00] like he's describing the
[1:20:02] bride you know
[1:20:05] what when we get tired there won't be no
[1:20:08] argument
[1:20:09] about Revelations 1 and what it
[1:20:14] means it won't be no fussing that this
[1:20:17] could be this way or this could be that
[1:20:18] away I emphasize brother Dale it's more
[1:20:21] the Judgment than I do the feminist
[1:20:25] the other one I I emphasize the feminist
[1:20:27] and not the Judgment well why can't we
[1:20:29] put it all
[1:20:33] together you
[1:20:34] know see the queen is going to sit there
[1:20:38] on the
[1:20:40] throne with the
[1:20:44] King and your judgment is going to be
[1:20:46] the
[1:20:49] decision of what takes
[1:20:53] place in Cas you just see it as you're
[1:20:55] sitting there
[1:20:57] and someone walks up because it won't be
[1:20:59] we won't be judging Paul's age and
[1:21:02] arenus and no no it's going to be down
[1:21:04] here where we're at okay but you're
[1:21:07] sitting there someone walks up before
[1:21:12] you and the whatever what you call them
[1:21:16] in the court the proclaimer as we'll
[1:21:18] call
[1:21:19] it what is the case and they'll say so
[1:21:22] and so and so and so and they done so
[1:21:23] and so done this and they never accepted
[1:21:26] Jesus
[1:21:30] Christ and he'll be ready
[1:21:33] to pass
[1:21:35] judgment
[1:21:37] right and say
[1:21:41] guilty but that little
[1:21:45] wife if you say
[1:21:48] but
[1:21:50] hubby honey darling sweetie whatever you
[1:21:53] want to call him
[1:21:58] and that person helped me change the
[1:21:59] tire one
[1:22:02] day that person helped me when I needed
[1:22:05] some gas money or I needed
[1:22:07] a a job or a point and that person
[1:22:11] helped
[1:22:15] me said could there be any
[1:22:21] Mercy
[1:22:23] well you you
[1:22:25] know I believe he loves his little wife
[1:22:28] and I believe he listened to her because
[1:22:30] she's not trying to finagle anything or
[1:22:34] her judgment would be judgment in other
[1:22:36] words you ask her sitting there you say
[1:22:38] what he says the judgment is
[1:22:40] death what is the judgment to why say
[1:22:43] death because they did not accept Jesus
[1:22:47] Christ but
[1:22:49] said you know they did help me the Bible
[1:22:53] says a cup of water in my name won't be
[1:22:55] forgotten in this world or the world to
[1:22:57] come
[1:22:59] right
[1:23:01] so somebody could receive eternal life
[1:23:03] because of
[1:23:05] your pleading the
[1:23:09] case cuz you know why I love the prophet
[1:23:12] would bring it he said what if you were
[1:23:14] going to
[1:23:16] court and he said you're going into
[1:23:18] court with a
[1:23:22] case and said the judge is on your side
[1:23:27] said even the prosecuting attorney on
[1:23:29] your
[1:23:32] side he said you feel pretty
[1:23:35] good I remember a sister told a young
[1:23:37] girl told one time she got called for
[1:23:39] speeding and when she had to go to court
[1:23:41] you know she was just a young kid she
[1:23:43] had to go to court said said she's so
[1:23:46] nervous and everything and going didn't
[1:23:48] know what was going to be and but her
[1:23:50] daddy he picked her up you know and he
[1:23:52] took her over and walked in and said
[1:23:55] he walked in there and said there set
[1:23:57] that judge up on her oh Lord he's going
[1:24:00] to get me he's going to find me he's
[1:24:03] going to do said the judge looked on I
[1:24:05] won't call the names because of I said
[1:24:07] the judge looked over there and said
[1:24:09] well hello there dick
[1:24:15] Addison how you doing she said I felt
[1:24:18] pretty
[1:24:19] good because I figured well Daddy knows
[1:24:22] the
[1:24:23] judge
[1:24:27] well you know we do know the
[1:24:31] judge do you know we can plead each
[1:24:33] mother's
[1:24:35] case
[1:24:37] now why wait till Judgment Day to think
[1:24:40] about judging and
[1:24:44] whatever we can plead one another's
[1:24:48] case did your Prophet say it I didn't he
[1:24:52] said a pastor is an intercessor
[1:24:54] I didn't make that statement he
[1:24:58] did you know I want somebody to plead my
[1:25:01] case don't
[1:25:04] you I can holler and scream all that I'm
[1:25:06] not
[1:25:10] guilty you
[1:25:14] know best thing to do is throw yourself
[1:25:17] on the mercy of the
[1:25:19] Court whatever case we got and I thought
[1:25:23] that we were supposed to be dealing with
[1:25:26] getting rid of ourselves
[1:25:29] here and our problems and
[1:25:33] troubles are supposed to be solved here
[1:25:35] before we get
[1:25:38] there because he's our
[1:25:43] judge and as a prosecuting attorney he
[1:25:46] can't override the
[1:25:50] judge cuz he's the final
[1:25:52] Authority but what about about her
[1:25:54] sitting
[1:25:55] there he's the final Authority she's the
[1:25:59] final Authority under
[1:26:05] him be a wonderful day
[1:26:11] Church to see what he thinks of you and
[1:26:18] I he declares we are the grain that went
[1:26:21] into the
[1:26:23] ground
[1:26:25] he declares that we are in the
[1:26:27] dispensation of the time to be the
[1:26:30] ending of all
[1:26:33] things he says we as the bride are the
[1:26:36] fullness of the godhead
[1:26:42] bodily but of course we Dre a quote
[1:26:44] brother so and
[1:26:46] so that I heard him say it he said you
[1:26:49] say that briide the fullness of the
[1:26:50] godhead bodily
[1:26:53] he don't believe it I won't say what he
[1:26:56] said because everybody know for certain
[1:26:59] he said I don't believe
[1:27:01] it well you know that didn't change me
[1:27:04] from believing it you know what that
[1:27:07] made me believe it
[1:27:13] more you know when he said he didn't
[1:27:16] believe it may me believe it more right
[1:27:19] and made me Rejoice to think of this
[1:27:23] trained
[1:27:24] person that had been in the message all
[1:27:27] of his life
[1:27:28] yeah but yet he couldn't see a simple
[1:27:32] little
[1:27:34] thing of believing what the prophet
[1:27:39] said he still wanted his ideas to go
[1:27:43] with
[1:27:44] it bride form come on Brothers bride
[1:27:51] form the last IM morphe of God
[1:28:00] in the last
[1:28:03] days we are to make
[1:28:07] manifest all that was spoke of and
[1:28:11] that's why it says they without
[1:28:14] us cannot be made perfect the word there
[1:28:19] is not dealing with a Perfection of
[1:28:22] trying to raise them up out out of the
[1:28:24] ground and preach something to them that
[1:28:26] would make them
[1:28:28] saved it means
[1:28:32] complete our
[1:28:34] fullness a full
[1:28:36] age a full
[1:28:41] dispensation that's what God thinks of
[1:28:43] his little
[1:28:44] bride what do we think about
[1:28:48] ourselves well I know I done this know I
[1:28:50] done that know done that yeah I know
[1:28:58] that but he said he put it in the sea of
[1:29:02] forgetfulness never to be remembered no
[1:29:05] more
[1:29:08] right let's stand what we got 288 the
[1:29:12] red
[1:29:15] bat anybody have a need the altar is
[1:29:17] open troubles and times are here filling
[1:29:22] men's hearts with
[1:29:25] we
[1:29:30] all heart to God Ching Rock seek the way
[1:29:44] Fus morning
[1:29:47] night many will
[1:29:50] me will
[1:29:53] sound
[1:29:56] again about
[1:30:00] him it is he the Bible said and that
[1:30:04] made us and not we
[1:30:10] ourselves we are his
[1:30:13] people you know that's an Old Testament
[1:30:17] scripture come
[1:30:20] to an old test man they were tied up in
[1:30:25] all kind of
[1:30:27] ways but he made that
[1:30:30] atonement he said
[1:30:39] black will not
[1:30:44] sin that was a man that didn't have the
[1:30:47] new
[1:30:51] birth if he could do that under the
[1:30:53] anointing
[1:30:54] why can't we believe who he has said we
[1:31:01] are
[1:31:04] up
[1:31:08] world do you live with your wife your
[1:31:11] husband because she's real
[1:31:17] good now we say oh yeah all of our wives
[1:31:19] are hting real good that's what we say
[1:31:21] right but you understand what I'm saying
[1:31:25] do you live with them because they're
[1:31:30] good or you live with them because you
[1:31:32] love
[1:31:34] them oh you love
[1:31:39] them love covers a
[1:31:42] what multitude of
[1:31:45] sin Love is
[1:31:49] Blind my wife thinks I'm the best
[1:31:51] looking guy in the world
[1:31:54] I keep telling her she need to get some
[1:31:59] glasses but see it's looking through her
[1:32:06] eyes that's the way God
[1:32:10] is he looks through wonderful eyes and
[1:32:12] don't see our
[1:32:15] problems he hears our Voice through the
[1:32:21] blood think about it Church
[1:32:26] he has come down to the last that's
[1:32:30] right we're not talking about dates and
[1:32:32] times and Seasons I've preaching this 40
[1:32:34] 40 years
[1:32:36] ago but somebody is going to
[1:32:40] say I and my father are
[1:32:43] one the prophet says the shook will pull
[1:32:47] away that's
[1:32:49] right of course now if you always just
[1:32:51] people well in a way I think maybe we
[1:32:53] could be we maybe maybe we are Brother G
[1:32:55] may may maybe we're the children of well
[1:32:58] why don't you be like us
[1:33:00] Baptist come on us Baptist you could ask
[1:33:03] them say you say I think I am I hope I
[1:33:06] am I believe I am and one day when I get
[1:33:09] over the other side I know what I
[1:33:12] am that's why when this Prophet away he
[1:33:15] started talking I said God what this man
[1:33:18] is I don't know but he's positive about
[1:33:20] what he's
[1:33:22] saying let us get away from that
[1:33:24] negativism you know oh I'm down and out
[1:33:27] brother you ain't never had problems I
[1:33:35] got is your
[1:33:37] problems deteriorate I mean taking you
[1:33:40] down or is it like the prophet
[1:33:44] said he said our problems was given to
[1:33:46] us to bring us to Perfection is that the
[1:33:48] way he said it can I paraphrase a quote
[1:33:51] and say it that a
[1:33:52] way
[1:33:56] but you see we don't want it that
[1:34:01] way we want it lined up straight down
[1:34:04] the highway
[1:34:06] well I mean if we're thinking about that
[1:34:09] they've got this place up in Alaska to
[1:34:11] send us to and they got them all over
[1:34:13] the country to send us to and and they
[1:34:16] they're doing away with every bit of our
[1:34:17] money they're doing away with all of our
[1:34:19] doings we're going to be hungry we're
[1:34:20] going to be this and oh it's going to be
[1:34:22] lovey-dovey
[1:34:24] you know it's going oh it's wonderful
[1:34:26] it's lovey
[1:34:28] doy I don't think it' be lovey
[1:34:31] doy when they take all your money away
[1:34:33] from you take your cars away take your
[1:34:36] home
[1:34:37] away may I quote brother brandom he said
[1:34:41] keep your homes and take the mark of the
[1:34:46] beast oh I don't believe he said that
[1:34:49] I'll find it for you and I'll put it on
[1:34:51] the next message so remind me
[1:34:57] to see that's where we just got our own
[1:35:00] ways and our own thoughts well you know
[1:35:03] what we're about as valuable as brother
[1:35:05] Ren says we are he says you want to know
[1:35:08] how valuable you are he said you take a
[1:35:10] glass of water and you stick your finger
[1:35:12] in the glass of water and you pull it
[1:35:15] back out and you try to find a
[1:35:18] hole well that's how valuable we
[1:35:22] are but you know what
[1:35:26] God has took us and made us his bride
[1:35:31] what greater thing could
[1:35:33] be than for him to declare that's my
[1:35:38] bride I'm going to stand in the middle
[1:35:40] of
[1:35:44] her think about
[1:35:46] it father we love
[1:35:50] you and we just ask you to go with us
[1:35:52] now as we go home
[1:35:54] and may we think about these things that
[1:35:56] have been
[1:35:58] said and I know I don't have the ability
[1:36:01] to speak eloquently and sometimes I'm
[1:36:03] just hard and arrogant and
[1:36:06] hateful but yet you just take the words
[1:36:09] and you put it
[1:36:10] together because I don't know how to do
[1:36:15] it I know a lot of times it sound like I
[1:36:18] get upset and I
[1:36:20] do but you know what my upset is
[1:36:24] my upsetness is us not
[1:36:28] you you say that I'm perfect why can't I
[1:36:32] say what you
[1:36:33] say you say the bride is the son of man
[1:36:38] why can't we say
[1:36:40] that you say that the bride is the
[1:36:43] fullness of the godhead bodily why can't
[1:36:46] we say
[1:36:47] that you say the bride is the grain that
[1:36:50] went into the ground to come forth in
[1:36:52] multiple form why can't we say
[1:36:56] that just help us Lord and guide us
[1:36:59] bless everybody on the way home give a
[1:37:00] safe journey we love you we thank you in
[1:37:03] Jesus name amen your
[1:37:06] dismissed as I travel through
[1:37:17] this saely through the
[1:37:20] S it is a of
[1:37:27] this
[1:37:30] be do the best I can
