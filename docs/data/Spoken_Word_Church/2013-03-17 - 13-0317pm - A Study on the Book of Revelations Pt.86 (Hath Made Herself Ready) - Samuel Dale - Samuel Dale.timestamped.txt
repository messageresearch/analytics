[27:37] desire our prayer Lord is the center of
[27:39] Revival among us to revive each and
[27:42] every Hearts because we know a Revival
[27:44] is not to revive Sinners the revivalist
[27:48] to revive Christian the Lord that have
[27:50] been in the way and then Sinners will
[27:52] see that fire burning in their hearts
[27:53] and their lives and they'll they'll come
[27:55] to the fire and and get saved themselves
[27:58] and then they'll have a Revival life we
[28:01] love you and we thank you just have your
[28:02] way remember the sick ones Among Us and
[28:05] just bless each and everyone in Jesus
[28:07] name amen Revelations
[28:12] one and then we'll go to Revelations 19.
[28:15] this is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[28:17] which God gave them to him to show unto
[28:19] his servants things which must shortly
[28:21] come to pass and he said and signifies
[28:23] it by his Angel unto his servant John
[28:25] who by record of the word of God under
[28:28] the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[28:30] things that he saw
[28:32] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[28:34] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[28:37] those things which are written therein
[28:38] or the time is at hand right okay in
[28:43] Revelation 19.
[28:45] one Drew about verse 9.
[28:49] and after these things I heard a great
[28:52] voice of much people in heaven I noticed
[28:56] in heaven
[28:57] saying Hallelujah Salvation and Glory
[29:01] and Honor and power unto the Lord our
[29:03] God
[29:04] for true and righteous are his judgments
[29:07] for he has judged the great which
[29:09] had corrupted earthquake or fornication
[29:11] and that the means the blood of his
[29:13] servants at her hands it's all done
[29:16] finished
[29:17] and again he said Hallelujah her smoke
[29:20] rose up forever and ever amen and the
[29:22] Four and Twenty Elders I notice who's
[29:24] here four in 20 Elders so that would be
[29:28] in this situation that would be your Old
[29:31] Testament Saints
[29:33] right and your 12 apostles see
[29:37] of the New Testament all right
[29:40] the four beasts fell down to worship God
[29:42] that said on the throne saying amen
[29:45] Allelujah
[29:47] and a voice came out of the throne
[29:50] saying praise our God
[29:53] for praise our God all ye servants and
[29:56] ye that fear Him both small and great
[29:58] and as I heard as it were the voice of a
[30:00] great multitude it is the voice of many
[30:02] Waters never Waters of people in that
[30:04] right and as the voice of Mighty
[30:06] thundering saying hallelujah for the
[30:09] Lord God and never turn right around and
[30:11] said thousands of Little Voices
[30:13] thundering out
[30:15] the word of the Lord right
[30:19] let's be glad and rejoice and give honor
[30:21] to him for the marriage of the Lamb has
[30:23] come and his wife hath made herself
[30:25] ready and to her was granted that she
[30:27] should be arrayed and noticed and to her
[30:30] was granted
[30:32] me that she should be arrayed and find
[30:35] linen clean and white for the fine
[30:37] lineness of righteousness of the Saints
[30:39] and he saith unto me right
[30:41] blessed are they which are called unto
[30:43] the marriage supper
[30:45] of the lamb and he said unto me these
[30:48] are the true sayings of God he may be
[30:51] seated the Lord had his blessings to the
[30:54] reading of the word
[30:58] now immediately you see that
[31:02] in your reading there it says after
[31:05] these things
[31:07] all right
[31:09] after
[31:12] these things we'll read it in a second
[31:13] after Revelations 18 4. after come out
[31:17] of her right amen then you can see this
[31:20] happening in heaven
[31:22] because that's where it's at it's not a
[31:25] situation on Earth
[31:27] we have been through those things to
[31:30] cover the uh the things that happened to
[31:34] the ones who reject the word
[31:37] to turn down the word would mean that
[31:39] you would be rejected and you'd be a
[31:42] part of those people that will have to
[31:44] come over and uh to a 20th chapter I
[31:47] think is the next it comes to their 20
[31:49] yeah 20. and it will talk about the uh
[31:55] you know you know but this is here at
[31:59] this situation
[32:00] in Revelations 19.
[32:04] now put it in your this in your mind we
[32:06] won't get to it tonight this afternoon
[32:08] but we will eventually go on into it
[32:12] Revelations 19
[32:14] is coming back in the Millennium right
[32:18] all right that is the right into the
[32:20] Millennium but before that can happen
[32:23] you've got to cover verse 7
[32:27] more of this
[32:29] group of people to be ready
[32:33] you'll be going to just jump on over
[32:34] more that's a great ride in this doing
[32:36] them and they've got a big ride and
[32:39] preachers that preached out we're going
[32:40] to come back down and we're going to
[32:42] fight well you know with people and like
[32:44] I asked you the other day what kind of a
[32:46] battle would it be
[32:48] you know I mean you're going to fight
[32:50] literal people but you're going to have
[32:51] eternal people fighting literal people
[32:53] now wouldn't that be fun
[32:55] and it wouldn't need to be nothing it
[32:56] wouldn't take but one person to just
[32:57] speaks the word and they're all gone
[32:59] it's not no it's not that away it's what
[33:03] we have conceived right there because of
[33:07] a ride of a victory or whatever but when
[33:09] you're riding in a victory ride the
[33:11] enemy is already defeated amen I mean
[33:14] that's what I thought right you know I I
[33:16] didn't think you went out and and cut
[33:19] Donuts at a racetrack Before the Race
[33:22] started
[33:23] I thought it was supposed to be after
[33:25] the race was over with and you're taking
[33:27] a Victory lap you know and you you're
[33:30] you know
[33:31] but that's the way people think but
[33:34] anyhow
[33:35] you said after these things
[33:39] all right after all that we've talked
[33:43] about for weeks and months and things
[33:45] how these things off of the uh
[33:49] situation of people
[33:52] in the tribulation period
[33:55] in all that will be will come upon
[33:57] Mankind and and it'll be a horrible
[34:00] thing we went through all of those
[34:02] things covering the the situations like
[34:05] that
[34:05] and I know we didn't do justice or
[34:08] didn't stay on it long enough but at
[34:10] least we could get enough to understand
[34:13] all right and then I've always
[34:16] understood
[34:18] that the bride goes up in Revelations 4
[34:21] 1 there you know amen where John was
[34:24] taken up as a type
[34:26] and not seen until this 19th Chapter
[34:30] you know
[34:31] and coming back with Christ
[34:34] all right and then see people will go
[34:36] into over what about 10-7 what about
[34:38] 18-4 you know come out over my people
[34:41] we're going to read in a minute that
[34:42] brought around said after this 18 4.
[34:47] you know
[34:48] after this come out of her my people
[34:51] all right I hope you caught this morning
[34:53] and have been with me long enough to
[34:55] understand that I believe the seals and
[34:57] things like that
[34:58] are to Israel amen but the Revelation is
[35:03] to you and I that's right but the first
[35:05] COC started back in Genesis and it wrote
[35:09] all the way through and it's still
[35:10] writing and actually is not into full
[35:13] manifestation even at this time because
[35:16] that would be the man of sin sitting in
[35:18] the temple of God showing himself to be
[35:20] as God and we're supposed to be out of
[35:22] here in the Rapture before that
[35:24] transpires all right and then like the
[35:27] force fields it would start back there
[35:28] with a battle with uh Cain and Abel and
[35:31] things like that and would consummate or
[35:34] end up in the life's days in the battle
[35:37] that would come down to Armageddon and
[35:40] we certainly don't want to be there
[35:41] because that would be in the tribulation
[35:43] period
[35:44] but yet we as the bride of Christ can
[35:47] see these things
[35:50] and how they lead up to that
[35:53] see it didn't start out as a an
[35:55] antichrist it started out as a Deeds of
[35:59] Nicholas
[36:00] then he becomes a doctrine of the
[36:03] Nicolaitans right he didn't start out uh
[36:08] a pope or a priest or a
[36:11] Prophet he'd have to start out and just
[36:14] gradually work its way in to that
[36:17] situation well we're here during that
[36:18] period of time so then reading the Bible
[36:21] we can see a compound meaning out of it
[36:23] that it can mean these things but yet we
[36:26] can feed it because we can see how it's
[36:29] beginning to happen and it has a
[36:32] compound meaning to you and I of course
[36:34] come out of her my people
[36:36] right
[36:38] right that's for you and I
[36:40] mean as I said this morning ended it up
[36:42] there won't be a Revelations 19 ride
[36:47] if we don't come out of her right that's
[36:49] right and get into him I remember I was
[36:53] introducing the message to a manner at
[36:55] work and her whole group of them and you
[36:58] know when I've been kind of dealing with
[36:59] them and everything and they start doing
[37:01] a little preaching and talking and and
[37:04] this one man he I guess he'd heard
[37:06] enough of it and he'd said you know
[37:08] everybody's talking about come out of
[37:09] her come out of her he said when we
[37:11] gonna get into him and I said well he's
[37:14] at least he's caught on to what's what
[37:16] I'm trying to do you know you know I
[37:18] hope you know that now you can take and
[37:22] go back for about three months and
[37:25] listen to these tapes coming down
[37:27] because this is the service that it's
[37:29] pointing to to you know that we'll get
[37:32] to it in a minute the Lord willing to
[37:33] come out of her
[37:35] my people and then what
[37:39] the bride the wife right right that's
[37:42] made herself ready all right see that
[37:45] way these things we must come out of
[37:50] we must come out of man's ideas we must
[37:53] come out of of organized religion we
[37:55] must come out of things but we don't
[37:57] have to be kind of like a man in a
[38:00] church one time they they put up a
[38:02] little heading up there what their
[38:03] church was and it was so and so so and
[38:06] said org you know
[38:09] you know how you do that on the computer
[38:10] you got org well this man had been in
[38:13] the church I don't know exactly how long
[38:16] but he's been there quite as many years
[38:18] well he just got up and walked out
[38:21] and he said I ain't having nothing to do
[38:23] with organized religion
[38:25] well that was on the computer then said
[38:27] in that organization org you know on the
[38:30] computer but see that's the way we think
[38:33] we're right
[38:34] well you know what that person was
[38:36] because nobody else would have probably
[38:39] agreed with him or thought about that
[38:42] kind of a way so he was his own or RG
[38:45] he had become his own organization
[38:48] himself by thinking of what that was
[38:52] right we see we think we're so right
[38:55] you know until we'll stand and do
[38:59] whatever turn against everything yeah
[39:00] but now listen
[39:04] as I said when he would look at it
[39:09] see they ended up I did with with the
[39:12] point
[39:14] that the about the last verse 23 there
[39:17] of the 18th chapter
[39:20] it shows coming down to Great
[39:22] destruction
[39:24] that will happen and I was reading to
[39:26] you a word that wrote around said they
[39:29] would be bombs fall on the Vatican right
[39:33] to annihilate it I told you if you read
[39:36] the scripture then it says that they the
[39:39] merchants were living back away you know
[39:41] that that their gold and silver that's
[39:43] all over there it's just burnt up
[39:45] there's nobody wanting it because
[39:48] he's too dangerous you know to move over
[39:50] any closer and also they back away and
[39:54] and actually even more in the scripture
[39:57] says for the fact of the great City why
[40:00] because they lose everything right see
[40:02] you say what what would that matter
[40:05] about that well the gold is the economy
[40:08] right right everybody's on the gold
[40:10] standard and everyone who backs that up
[40:14] is the people that own you
[40:17] you know they don't brother Dave I'm
[40:19] free that's like Israel when they said
[40:22] to Jesus said we're under bondage to no
[40:26] man
[40:28] you know that description right amen and
[40:31] Romans out there killing them for what
[40:32] right
[40:34] but boy they thought we're free we've
[40:36] never been under bondage
[40:38] you'll be under bondage to your own self
[40:40] that's right you see ending It Up by
[40:43] saying to show that that the the bride
[40:46] is not there
[40:50] you wonder why I keep relating to
[40:53] something because I relate to it to make
[40:56] that dig into your brain all right first
[40:58] into the head okay
[41:01] from chapter four
[41:04] to chapter 19 is only three and a half
[41:07] years period of time right which is
[41:10] called the tribulation here in Jacob's
[41:12] trouble amen all right now then when it
[41:15] ends the ending of chapter 18 was what
[41:20] and The Voice
[41:22] of the bridegroom yep
[41:25] and divorce
[41:27] for the bride
[41:29] is no longer heard in her
[41:32] the world see this world system the
[41:34] religious system why because she done
[41:37] been taken out
[41:39] she was not there into this tribulation
[41:41] this period of Destruction
[41:44] you know
[41:45] in all that we've been talking about for
[41:47] right you know for months and months and
[41:50] see I'm sure it was boring to some of
[41:52] you but but this now you can look back
[41:55] and say hey wait a minute
[41:58] this was the foundation to be able to
[42:01] come over and say and understand come
[42:04] out of her my people
[42:08] you got to know what to come out of us
[42:11] that's right right
[42:13] or you get your coat and hat and move
[42:15] houses you know
[42:18] and just go to another church
[42:20] oh Lord you know boy and I've always
[42:23] told you I never introduced any of you
[42:25] to the message he's going to the house
[42:27] by trying to tell you the Catholic
[42:29] church was wrong and the Baptist was
[42:31] wrong and the message this was wrong and
[42:32] right I didn't do it that way
[42:35] I approached you on the godhead
[42:39] others dealt with those things but I
[42:41] approached you on the godhead
[42:43] but I've seen a lot of things I've seen
[42:45] that people who come out of organized
[42:48] religion because they believe organized
[42:50] religion is wrong
[42:53] brother Whidbey had a good point said to
[42:56] get you out with a hot dog
[42:58] did they just get you in with a
[42:59] hamburger somebody come along with
[43:01] something sounds a little better and
[43:03] you'll just flop right to it yeah
[43:05] but if you get people on the revealed
[43:07] word the revelation of the one true and
[43:10] living God
[43:11] right see then you won't be fighting
[43:14] organized religion trying to find out
[43:16] what it is when you're sitting in the
[43:17] middle of it
[43:18] right you'll be seeing that Jesus Christ
[43:22] is the same yesterday today and forever
[43:25] you'll see him alive that's my goal all
[43:28] right now so what is it then
[43:31] after these things
[43:34] I heard a great voice of many people in
[43:39] heaven
[43:43] right now if this is in heaven
[43:47] and you know
[43:49] and even Schofield and his
[43:52] notes of it he's showing you that this
[43:55] is the glorified Saints
[43:58] you know coming down through there he
[43:59] even speaks of it that way himself right
[44:01] yeah and see then you come down to see
[44:05] but this button remember it's in heaven
[44:09] see the Rapture took place in 4-1 right
[44:13] so the bride is in heaven when you see
[44:16] the bride in Revelation 5 she's in
[44:19] heaven that's right
[44:22] six
[44:23] hell's about the thing drops to Earth to
[44:26] give you Earthly scenes and Earthly
[44:28] happenings and and what's going on on
[44:31] Earth for that tribulation period
[44:34] but see now
[44:36] the bride is in glory
[44:38] the Rapture has come
[44:42] now I'm going to say it so listen
[44:46] if the Rapture has come
[44:49] you know hear this situation there will
[44:52] be a time it'll come right amen and you
[44:54] know what that means
[44:56] that means the wife has already made
[44:58] herself ready right right when you're
[45:01] coming down here it's just a a statement
[45:04] of being glad and rejoiced
[45:08] because it is not that we go into
[45:11] rapture
[45:12] and then we have to be taught something
[45:14] to make us a wife
[45:20] when we go out here in a Rapture it's
[45:22] the why has made herself ready
[45:25] you see a wife signifies a a woman of of
[45:31] uh
[45:33] in other words marital maturity right
[45:36] right man whereas a bride can be just
[45:39] engaged
[45:41] you know right they're the engagement
[45:43] we're getting the marriage to divorce
[45:45] when we finish this but if we ever get
[45:47] finished
[45:49] but anyhow
[45:52] but it comes to a wife
[45:56] it's not a little uh let's see let me go
[45:59] back and pick up something I don't want
[46:01] to drop a lot of time but you remember
[46:03] in the the book of of the songs of
[46:06] Solomon
[46:07] right and the songs of Solomon you hear
[46:10] a lot about it wrote around says that is
[46:13] referring to the bride and he is the
[46:15] bridegroom and and the different things
[46:17] happening
[46:18] but you'll notice when you get on over
[46:20] into the songs of Solomon you'll find a
[46:24] little sister
[46:27] is referred to that
[46:31] instead of a little sister
[46:34] and forgive me for quoting scripture but
[46:36] it is scripture and says she has no
[46:38] breast
[46:42] why would it emphasize that
[46:47] but yet it turns around as to
[46:52] the bride referring and says
[46:55] we'll build on her
[46:58] I remember brother uh
[47:00] for the Howard Carroll if you're ever
[47:03] out and he's out preaching away from his
[47:05] church most of the time he preaches out
[47:07] of the songs of Solomon I enjoyed it
[47:09] really good
[47:10] but see that little sister it says the
[47:13] bride see referring and the groom
[47:16] the first said we'll build on her
[47:19] well I think that's what's happening in
[47:21] the end time
[47:23] if the Bible's right that they without
[47:25] us cannot be made perfect amen which
[47:28] doesn't mean that we will raise them up
[47:30] and preach something to them to perfect
[47:31] them but we will bring them to the
[47:34] position of those that have passed on to
[47:37] a body raised upon Earth you know to go
[47:40] up in a Rapture then because they've got
[47:42] to come forth all right
[47:44] now if that's true then
[47:48] everything's dependent upon this end
[47:51] time people
[47:52] and this little bride that would start
[47:55] out maybe as Luther Wesley Pentecost
[47:59] not understand too much of the word of
[48:01] God she would be a little young girl and
[48:04] yet she grows into maturity
[48:08] it's kind of like delete armor Meat
[48:10] Packing
[48:12] man that went out to get a wife you know
[48:14] and he sees her and she's not fully
[48:16] matured at that time she's out there
[48:18] doing the things and
[48:21] he's not ready for a wedding right he's
[48:25] not even thinking about a wedding
[48:27] but he proposes to her and goes away and
[48:30] comes back about a year later well you
[48:31] know what she's ready so that'll be the
[48:34] point today is is the wife that made
[48:36] herself ready
[48:39] now yours two things will be covered
[48:44] y'all put it up front
[48:46] when it says the wife hath made herself
[48:48] ready right
[48:49] now there's only one quote of that and
[48:51] wrote about them in the scripture where
[48:53] he literally said the wife is made
[48:55] herself ready he'll always use the bride
[48:57] that made herself ready so I think he's
[48:59] referring to the same person don't you
[49:00] it's just his way of expressing it all
[49:03] right but
[49:05] if she's made herself ready then she has
[49:08] something to do with it
[49:10] right amen that's right
[49:15] now I've always tried to preach to you
[49:17] as much as I understand all right
[49:21] I don't hold up secrets and I don't try
[49:24] to trick you in any way to believe
[49:25] something
[49:26] I believe that salvation is of the Lord
[49:30] all right and I believe that scripture
[49:33] now I believe it's not anything you've
[49:35] done or didn't do
[49:37] we'll ever bring you to Salvation me you
[49:41] or anybody
[49:43] I don't believe that I believe salvation
[49:45] is purely of the Lord amen all right
[49:48] but now here is what I do believe
[49:51] I believe that when you're born again
[49:56] you can call it potential
[49:58] you can call it Earnest parts or
[50:01] whatever
[50:02] but see when you're born again
[50:06] never the baby's here they're they got
[50:08] every parked they were born with it
[50:10] other than an abnormality of something
[50:12] to happen
[50:13] all right
[50:15] and they just all they've got to do is
[50:16] just keep eating to fill that out well
[50:18] you know what putting that in the
[50:20] stomach there's some wet just keep
[50:21] pushing them bodies out don't it and
[50:23] they just grow well I thought that's
[50:26] what Christianity was about
[50:29] so then using this scripture now the
[50:31] white the wife hath made herself
[50:35] I'll cover this over and over in a
[50:37] message soon hang on to the point
[50:40] see she's got something to do with it
[50:42] right after you were born again you have
[50:45] something to do with your salvation and
[50:48] we're not talking about getting you
[50:50] saved right right if you don't volunteer
[50:53] for these virtues to be made manifest if
[50:56] you don't seek God for these things
[50:59] you're going to die of malnutrition
[51:02] and you may be a baby you may be a
[51:05] Christian but you're going to die of
[51:06] malnutrition amen so you do have
[51:09] something to do what make yourself
[51:11] available
[51:13] he's got everything provided
[51:16] you don't have to go out and do anything
[51:18] you just believe what he's got right
[51:22] well I quit this and I quit that that's
[51:24] honorable yeah
[51:28] and if it's coming from a heart of a
[51:30] true Saint it's glorious amen
[51:35] I Don't Preach to be saved
[51:38] right I'm glad that Prophet made those
[51:41] things straight
[51:44] he said if I never preached another
[51:46] sermon he said I'm not going to die
[51:48] until now
[51:50] do you know how salvation on what you do
[51:52] in the don't do it right but he said I
[51:54] preached because I love him amen well
[51:56] how could he ever quit preaching right
[51:59] how can a preacher retire all right you
[52:03] might not understand what I was getting
[52:04] at this morning I'm sure you don't but
[52:06] yeah I'm funny anyway but I'm right I
[52:09] mean I try to say what the prophet said
[52:13] do you don't go to preacher in
[52:15] you don't vote for me to be a preacher
[52:17] right
[52:18] you might have voted for me to come to
[52:20] this church and settle down with you and
[52:22] preach to you but you didn't vote for
[52:24] whether or not I'm the preacher
[52:26] God places in the church right right
[52:29] right right
[52:31] well we're going to have a vote
[52:33] I pray a lot about that way you're
[52:36] saying it yeah
[52:38] because you might have something else in
[52:40] mind right now you might be trying to
[52:44] figure out who's who's and no it might
[52:46] be God see God has placed in the body
[52:50] so you wouldn't understand it no it's
[52:52] all right forget it
[52:54] listen Church
[52:57] after these things
[53:01] you see a great group of people
[53:04] it says in heaven right
[53:08] shouting and Glory Hallelujah
[53:14] because of that amen
[53:19] they're there
[53:22] he's not wondering whether you're going
[53:23] to make it or not
[53:27] amen
[53:29] at this time
[53:31] of this writing and Revelations 19 when
[53:34] it tracks powers
[53:36] see because we're not there so it's not
[53:38] transpired yet you understand
[53:40] at that time would have already been in
[53:42] the Merit been to
[53:45] the wedding supper
[53:48] in the marriage
[53:51] of the Lamb amen
[53:53] and then we're coming back into the
[53:55] millennium
[53:58] and that's what we're going to get to in
[54:00] a second because that's the difference
[54:02] of thoughts of people
[54:04] but I'm trying to not argue with people
[54:06] I'm trying to preach the gospel
[54:09] I've always tried to do that I know and
[54:11] I get in trouble by doing it but that's
[54:13] all right
[54:14] I don't worry about what I preached that
[54:16] gets me into trouble I worry about
[54:18] trying to get menu out of trouble right
[54:20] that's right it's not we're in trouble
[54:22] we were born in trouble
[54:25] to help us get out of it you know
[54:30] which sometimes it's about like nothing
[54:32] brother Howe back there he he's a great
[54:34] turkey hunter
[54:36] but I'm making a story okay brother how
[54:38] use him as an example because he is a
[54:41] great turkey hunter great deer hunter's
[54:43] with him in pain you know and uh last
[54:46] time you Kirby turkey hunting we got
[54:48] three Corner where's that he said you
[54:50] didn't see that Jack come down through
[54:51] there and I said I didn't see no Jake he
[54:54] said walk right behind you well I didn't
[54:56] hear it you know but I wasn't a hunter
[54:59] but my point is this wouldn't it be
[55:01] something to me to come up to him now
[55:03] and say now brother how you've been
[55:04] doing this wrong
[55:09] and I'm about 18 20 years old and I'm
[55:12] going to tell him I said now you've been
[55:12] doing this wrong
[55:15] well
[55:16] first off it'd be kind of silly but
[55:18] second off if he's really a turkey
[55:20] hunter and I could tell him a better way
[55:22] of doing it
[55:23] right
[55:25] right you getting the point amen if I
[55:28] could tell him about where to do it and
[55:30] prove it
[55:31] yep they then keep saying hey wait a
[55:33] minute let me listen to this guy right
[55:35] well I I think that's what the Bible has
[55:38] been trying to get all me and you to do
[55:40] amen his dude at least settle down and
[55:44] say I could be wrong
[55:46] you know right
[55:49] and Lord just show me I'm wrong and
[55:51] improve it to me and get me you know
[55:53] help me get rid of it and get straight
[55:56] yeah no that's all I'm trying to do all
[55:59] right
[56:00] but you notice now this is in heaven
[56:04] and there's a great proclamation in
[56:07] heaven
[56:09] but verse 4 says and there's four and
[56:12] twenty Elders in heaven
[56:15] well if it's four or Twenty Elders in
[56:17] heaven
[56:19] that means the 12 apostles and twelve
[56:21] Patriot arches in heaven right
[56:24] right amen well to my understanding
[56:30] the 12 apostles would represent the
[56:32] bride of Christ
[56:35] I mean if I'm wrong you know old or
[56:39] young come and show me how turkey hunts
[56:41] you know right
[56:42] tell me where I'm wrong
[56:43] that's what used to bother me for
[56:47] you know for
[56:49] well ever since I've been studying the
[56:50] message
[56:51] over 40 years the wine Revelations 5
[56:56] and in other Scriptures it would be in
[56:58] heaven then it would have 24 elders
[57:02] right
[57:03] together
[57:03] because I knew that 12 of them
[57:05] represented the New Testament and 12
[57:07] represented the Old Testament
[57:10] right now at this place when we're
[57:12] fixing to come back into the millennium
[57:16] ah
[57:17] you can do it in a minute about the
[57:19] marriage supper
[57:22] all right
[57:25] and in doing that
[57:27] there's the bride of Christ and there's
[57:29] the Old Testament Saints right
[57:33] seen in chapter five
[57:35] because it's 2400.
[57:38] okay then the Millennium is going to be
[57:40] to Israel so
[57:42] at this period of time they have
[57:44] evidently done been raised and come to
[57:46] this position
[57:48] and they're here in chapter 19.
[57:52] as to
[57:54] make manifest
[57:56] the four beasts is that combat power
[57:59] among the bride of Christ amen but also
[58:03] those combat beasts was in high are
[58:07] showing
[58:09] back in the Old Testament of the
[58:11] children of Israel and the way they
[58:13] camped and I used to preach off of that
[58:15] you know that they count like
[58:17] three three three and three right and
[58:21] it'd be Dan and different ones you know
[58:23] it's the lion the ox the man the eagle
[58:25] and we're all come forth and types
[58:27] exactly and when they started making
[58:29] their Journey the line had to go first
[58:31] and then the ox the groups the way they
[58:33] moved the way they're done it protected
[58:35] the word
[58:36] we'll see the note four beefs within the
[58:39] Old Testament just as well as the new so
[58:42] this can be covered old and you right
[58:44] amen but this is in glory
[58:46] fixing to come back into the millennial
[58:48] Reign amen something is taking place
[58:53] now why would it say
[58:58] and the wife is later separated
[59:03] when I said
[59:08] that this is in glory
[59:10] this is after the Rapture
[59:13] she'd already proven to be ready amen
[59:16] but it doesn't refer to a bride
[59:19] right
[59:21] it takes reference to a wife
[59:25] someone seasoned in the gospel
[59:29] remember
[59:30] instead of a little sister that cannot
[59:33] handle it too well
[59:36] some of the ages gone by couldn't handle
[59:38] the word of God right and God did not
[59:40] bring upon them more than they could
[59:43] handle right because he promised he
[59:45] wouldn't put anything on you that you
[59:47] couldn't that's right we're standing
[59:49] amen so no matter how hard or troubles
[59:51] it gets just remember
[59:54] he gave me more than what you can handle
[59:57] the Bible says it right amen
[1:00:00] so guys it may look rough but it's not
[1:00:03] but get it
[1:00:05] see it references here to who's in
[1:00:07] heaven
[1:00:09] fixing to
[1:00:12] descend
[1:00:16] and we're worshiping God
[1:00:18] getting ready
[1:00:20] but we're coming to are going to the
[1:00:22] millennial Reign we won't cover hearts
[1:00:25] of that this afternoon
[1:00:27] I just want to
[1:00:30] bring it to one point
[1:00:32] and I want you to think about it
[1:00:35] verse 7. let us be glad and rejoice
[1:00:39] and give honor to him
[1:00:41] for the marriage of the Lamb is come
[1:00:46] and his wife have to make herself ready
[1:00:49] now see you would agree with the
[1:00:52] approach that I made a moment I
[1:00:54] reflecting ago you would agree to the
[1:00:57] approach I made
[1:00:58] which I deliberately done that to for
[1:01:00] you to think that
[1:01:04] if this is in glory
[1:01:07] then it's not referring to the fact of
[1:01:10] the wife getting ready all right
[1:01:17] it's referring to the fact that she had
[1:01:20] already amen
[1:01:22] right yeah come on Ricky scripture why
[1:01:26] half
[1:01:29] is that past tense right made herself
[1:01:32] ready right okay
[1:01:35] well now you would amen that wouldn't
[1:01:37] you yeah
[1:01:38] but will you amen the other part
[1:01:43] where it says for the marriage
[1:01:46] with our
[1:01:48] brother marriage
[1:01:52] of the Lamb
[1:01:53] is
[1:01:56] come
[1:02:00] I know you amen that one
[1:02:04] meaning
[1:02:13] you're heading to a marriage
[1:02:19] it's come yes comes it's right there in
[1:02:21] front of you all right it doesn't mean
[1:02:24] necessarily you've totally entered
[1:02:25] therein it means it's present
[1:02:28] all right take place right
[1:02:31] all right the reason I bring that out is
[1:02:33] because something that's always bothered
[1:02:35] me and I've heard it and I know and I
[1:02:37] quoted brother random about it and
[1:02:39] everything but
[1:02:41] uh
[1:02:43] most everybody that I've heard of in the
[1:02:45] message realm they use this
[1:02:47] and they'll say well we're already
[1:02:50] married
[1:02:52] we're the bride of Christ
[1:02:54] but what do you mean brother they'll win
[1:02:56] it right across
[1:02:57] we're already married we're just going
[1:03:00] to the wedding supper
[1:03:03] you know in the sky
[1:03:09] well you know you're right
[1:03:11] but you don't have all the story
[1:03:19] we are married to Christ by the new
[1:03:21] birth
[1:03:23] he is our husband
[1:03:27] by the new bird right
[1:03:31] all right
[1:03:34] but now you're going to Discount the
[1:03:36] fact of
[1:03:37] the scripture stating here or the
[1:03:39] marriage of the
[1:03:41] lamb has come and then you get on over
[1:03:44] to verse 9 it says blessed are they
[1:03:47] which are called unto the marriage
[1:03:50] supper of the Lamb
[1:03:53] well brother Dale that just means a
[1:03:55] spiritual Happening Here
[1:03:58] see this that's our concept
[1:04:03] but I don't believe you can get your
[1:04:05] scriptures together correctly like that
[1:04:08] I mean I'm honest I can't
[1:04:10] we were discussing the other day and we
[1:04:13] we stay quiet
[1:04:15] about the uh three comings of the Lord
[1:04:19] you know
[1:04:21] going to redeem his bride he comes to
[1:04:24] get his bride and then he comes
[1:04:26] with his bride and so we held back on
[1:04:30] that and
[1:04:31] let them go ahead but see I only wanted
[1:04:33] to ask one questions and can we cross up
[1:04:36] scripture
[1:04:39] and get a good understanding
[1:04:41] you know the coming of the Lord
[1:04:43] in many ways in many forms right do you
[1:04:47] know that in the Millennium can be
[1:04:48] called The Coming of the Lord because
[1:04:50] that's what brought around
[1:04:53] that's the Israel in the morning that's
[1:04:55] us with him going through the Millennium
[1:04:58] right
[1:04:58] all right
[1:05:00] now
[1:05:02] see that way if you take a scripturally
[1:05:04] speaking of him coming to the bride
[1:05:07] and then you take another scripture of
[1:05:10] him coming to the Israel and you put
[1:05:13] them in the same place look what you've
[1:05:14] done
[1:05:16] right amen you crossed your scripture
[1:05:19] that may not mean a thing to you
[1:05:23] but you ought to at least listen
[1:05:25] say that though I'll agree with you on
[1:05:28] that it don't sound good
[1:05:30] you may not be able to understand why
[1:05:32] it's not a way
[1:05:34] but you couldn't at least listen to
[1:05:35] somebody that says it
[1:05:37] I ain't listening to that because that
[1:05:39] gets me confused no you're already
[1:05:40] confused
[1:05:43] all right now we're going to read and
[1:05:44] show from Brother running this afternoon
[1:05:46] the whole point is
[1:05:48] we are the Bride of Jesus Christ right
[1:05:51] now right by the new birth already
[1:05:53] married to him right and we're going to
[1:05:57] the wedding supper amen one day
[1:06:06] but then we're going to show that
[1:06:11] and I hope you don't get carnal on me
[1:06:13] when I make the word England I don't
[1:06:14] have another education
[1:06:16] we're going to show that we are not
[1:06:18] married to him
[1:06:22] and we're going to a wedding
[1:06:25] in the sky
[1:06:28] and then we're going to have a marriage
[1:06:29] supper
[1:06:32] because here we have a wedding
[1:06:39] right the little supper you gathered
[1:06:41] before then our customary ways here in
[1:06:43] America as we have a wedding
[1:06:45] and then we go to the wedding supper
[1:06:48] right
[1:06:49] it may be in Israel that they have the
[1:06:51] wedding supper first I don't want I
[1:06:54] don't want care I don't argue with that
[1:06:56] they may have their wedding supper
[1:06:57] before they have the marriage I don't
[1:06:59] I'm not worried about it I'm just trying
[1:07:00] to illustrate and bring a point
[1:07:06] you see I can say we're married to
[1:07:08] Christ
[1:07:12] and prove it to you
[1:07:14] scripturally that we're married to
[1:07:16] Christ amen
[1:07:18] but turn around and prove to you that
[1:07:19] we're going to
[1:07:21] a wedding in the sky
[1:07:27] because you didn't notice the reading of
[1:07:29] the scripture
[1:07:34] if you really read it
[1:07:37] pull it up for the job
[1:07:41] let's just really read this
[1:07:44] Revelations 19.
[1:07:46] we only need verse 7.
[1:07:53] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:07:56] honor to him
[1:07:58] for the marriage of the Lamb has come
[1:08:02] and his wife has made herself ready
[1:08:11] see we're going to a marriage in the sky
[1:08:15] because this is in the sky
[1:08:18] this 19 is not on Earth
[1:08:21] we're ready to start with verse one it
[1:08:24] says in heaven and don't say that heaven
[1:08:27] was looking down to earth
[1:08:29] this group of people this marriage is
[1:08:32] wedding
[1:08:35] is after 18 4.
[1:08:39] which says come out of her my people
[1:08:40] right so now let's read what the prophet
[1:08:42] had to say let's get started because I
[1:08:44] want you I want to read two quotes and
[1:08:46] one of them going one way one's going
[1:08:47] the other one
[1:08:52] now they have to come
[1:08:55] we've missed a boat right
[1:08:57] so think about it now
[1:09:00] the message why I'm against organized
[1:09:02] religion I'd be 62 11 11 11 eat
[1:09:05] paragraph two twenty notice the 19th
[1:09:09] Chapter
[1:09:11] here's the next
[1:09:12] after these things
[1:09:15] now don't get that tied up with it
[1:09:17] there's like one two three four four
[1:09:20] times in the Book of Revelation that
[1:09:22] uses after these times one of them is
[1:09:24] after the seals break one of them is
[1:09:26] after this and one of them you know a
[1:09:27] pretty early in the scripture get where
[1:09:29] he puts it Revelations 19. all right
[1:09:31] okay
[1:09:32] did you notice in the 19th Chapter after
[1:09:35] these signs watch what
[1:09:37] I asked her what
[1:09:39] answer the message
[1:09:41] I'll come out of her
[1:09:43] that's you and I right now the message
[1:09:47] the prophet's message come out of her my
[1:09:49] people right right okay
[1:09:51] after these things watch
[1:09:54] is the shout of the Bride Saints
[1:09:57] with the bridegroom
[1:10:00] going to the marriage of the Lamb
[1:10:07] now why does the Bible say
[1:10:13] the marriage of the Lamb
[1:10:21] it doesn't say marriage of the father
[1:10:27] my little boy you really are saying yeah
[1:10:29] you have a young man
[1:10:31] why did it be like twice there in
[1:10:34] chapter 19. it's the marriage of the
[1:10:36] Lamb has come
[1:10:39] now the lamb has a very special
[1:10:41] reference in the scripture
[1:10:45] in order in the Book of Revelation
[1:10:47] chapter five you find that Lamb with
[1:10:48] seven horns and seven eyes can even be
[1:10:50] called into the bride for him
[1:10:52] and what are you dealing with
[1:10:55] when you're dealing with the lamb what
[1:10:57] did what did John say behold now watch
[1:11:00] this watch with scriptures you keep it
[1:11:03] in your mind what did he say Behold the
[1:11:04] Lamb of God but did not John say behold
[1:11:08] the son of man
[1:11:13] what does that know what he said
[1:11:15] he said when he said behold the lamb
[1:11:18] he was referring to the son of man God
[1:11:20] made flesh
[1:11:23] all right so you'll catch on the second
[1:11:24] what we're talking about
[1:11:27] how close are we then brother what's the
[1:11:30] last call
[1:11:32] what's the last call to you and I
[1:11:36] come out of her
[1:11:39] not my brother that's the reason I'm
[1:11:41] against it
[1:11:42] scriptural
[1:11:44] it's not Orthodox let's talk about
[1:11:46] organized religion and then it wasn't
[1:11:48] order things right
[1:11:49] it's been proven to be false God is not
[1:11:52] in it
[1:11:54] he never was he never will be
[1:11:57] now I ain't saying that there's not
[1:11:59] people in those organizations that's
[1:12:03] where the church was made up of
[1:12:06] right right right
[1:12:08] but as long as you stay into that system
[1:12:13] what's the last four words
[1:12:16] amen you're a part of it
[1:12:21] you stay there and you're part of the
[1:12:23] system you sit right here with organized
[1:12:25] religion in your mind you're part of the
[1:12:27] system don't make no difference right
[1:12:28] right okay
[1:12:31] but look what he says
[1:12:36] he said after these things
[1:12:39] the shadow of the Bride
[1:12:41] Saints with the bridegroom what going to
[1:12:45] the marriage of the Lamb
[1:12:48] he's placing Revelations 19.
[1:12:52] I got a quote in here they say the
[1:12:54] brother said we don't understand see
[1:12:55] where is revelation where is the
[1:12:57] marriage of the Lamb places before the
[1:12:59] Triple A one he said the marriage of the
[1:13:01] Lamb that's before the millennium
[1:13:04] which is true it has to be right
[1:13:07] you because when you're calling into the
[1:13:09] money
[1:13:10] what do you understand now Mark that
[1:13:12] Mark that in your mind
[1:13:16] going to the marriage of the Lamb
[1:13:21] that's what this is happening here
[1:13:24] you see we're going to cover something
[1:13:26] in a minute that
[1:13:28] I want you to listen very carefully
[1:13:32] go to the number two really Joe
[1:13:36] take it for the second coming of the
[1:13:37] Lord priests 57 4 17.
[1:13:40] paragraph 87
[1:13:42] what would think of it mister
[1:13:45] we're not only engaged
[1:13:49] but we're married
[1:13:52] now he's talking about now right
[1:13:55] the church is married to Christ
[1:14:00] we are the wife of Christ bringing forth
[1:14:02] children
[1:14:05] you can go down through there and read
[1:14:07] the rest of that that everybody wants to
[1:14:08] deal with the sloppiness of the wife and
[1:14:10] the things and all that what has
[1:14:11] happened
[1:14:12] but the main point is what he said we
[1:14:14] was already married to Christ now he
[1:14:16] just said in the quote before then we're
[1:14:18] going to the marriage
[1:14:19] motherland
[1:14:24] is that contrary
[1:14:28] or do you understand what is really
[1:14:30] being said
[1:14:33] as I said it's very odd
[1:14:36] that it says the marriage the wife that
[1:14:39] made herself ready
[1:14:41] for what
[1:14:43] the marriage of the Lamb
[1:14:45] is come
[1:14:50] now we must preach a little bit on the
[1:14:52] god
[1:14:54] to make sure that we're clear
[1:14:57] we believe in one true and living God
[1:14:59] correct amen
[1:15:01] well we believe in many manifestations
[1:15:03] of that one God
[1:15:06] so in Revelations 5 brother random will
[1:15:09] take
[1:15:10] that when Jesus raised up
[1:15:15] and that's how the Old Testament Saints
[1:15:17] winds up in chapter 5.
[1:15:21] because he said they would raise rat
[1:15:24] your message right at the end of it he
[1:15:26] said then we'd raise and we'd marched
[1:15:28] through the sky going into Rapture going
[1:15:30] up
[1:15:32] it's his words
[1:15:34] but listen
[1:15:39] it says marriage of the Lamb
[1:15:44] because there's many manifestations of
[1:15:46] God
[1:15:48] now when he was here on Earth
[1:15:52] the Bible says that he was God With Us
[1:15:55] right Emmanuel
[1:15:59] but on the River Jordan the prophet
[1:16:02] covers that he become the fullness of
[1:16:04] the godhead bodily
[1:16:05] there's no problem because the anointing
[1:16:07] came down on him amen when the River
[1:16:09] Jordan right
[1:16:10] that anointing left him in the Garden of
[1:16:12] Gethsemane and quoting wrote around
[1:16:13] anybody out on the internet wants that
[1:16:15] call me
[1:16:18] um
[1:16:22] we're
[1:16:24] looking at things that are Supernatural
[1:16:27] trying to understand them with a peanut
[1:16:28] brain
[1:16:32] see then when Jesus would hear on Earth
[1:16:39] was he God Amen
[1:16:41] amen
[1:16:46] he was born Emmanuel
[1:16:49] but he entered his ministry and when he
[1:16:51] did he began to talk about the son of
[1:16:53] man
[1:16:57] who he was
[1:16:59] he was God made flesh right you left
[1:17:04] According to Hebrew John 1 and the word
[1:17:08] about verse 14. he was made flesh and
[1:17:09] dwell a moments right all right
[1:17:13] now brother there are you trying to tell
[1:17:15] me there's a there's a bride of the
[1:17:16] father and a bride of the son and you're
[1:17:19] trying to caring now you are for
[1:17:21] thinking that but I never preached
[1:17:24] nothing like that
[1:17:30] but if the Old Testament Saints winds up
[1:17:32] to be there
[1:17:34] now the Old Testament Saints is not
[1:17:37] Peter James John and them that's right
[1:17:40] right that's right that's right they was
[1:17:43] in the Old Testament they was part of
[1:17:45] the Old Testament
[1:17:50] but they're right right
[1:17:54] now what are you going to do
[1:17:56] with the Old Testament Saints the
[1:17:59] genuine Old Testament Saints never
[1:18:03] the Old Testament Saints
[1:18:11] Donald the prophet said
[1:18:15] do you not got it I love it
[1:18:19] I thought the prophet said
[1:18:21] that that was
[1:18:24] Jehovah's bride
[1:18:32] are you listening
[1:18:34] your Prophet said those Old Testament
[1:18:36] signs was Jehovah's bride
[1:18:42] yeah that's right he put him away
[1:18:44] how far did he put him away
[1:18:51] come on they never will come back to the
[1:18:54] right School ownership or a wife right
[1:18:59] but they will be in the millennium
[1:19:03] and if Revelations at 19 is correct with
[1:19:07] the 24 Elders they must be in heaven
[1:19:11] some way they got there
[1:19:15] he said well you're you're just
[1:19:16] confusing me
[1:19:19] now I thought
[1:19:25] that
[1:19:27] the Jehovah the old was Jesus of the new
[1:19:32] yeah
[1:19:34] is that correct
[1:19:37] are we still quoting brother Brown
[1:19:40] the Jehovah the old is Jesus of the new
[1:19:46] without seek and you can you visualize
[1:19:49] in the thinking
[1:19:50] that then those Old Testament Saints
[1:19:52] when they come up there
[1:19:55] some of them people face Jesus
[1:19:58] and they look right through and they
[1:20:00] seem
[1:20:01] that the Jehovah the old was standing
[1:20:03] back
[1:20:05] good until the death Pentecost when the
[1:20:08] Holy Ghost comes that's why Peter said
[1:20:12] I would
[1:20:17] I would up I said I have a more sure
[1:20:19] word prophecy that's right you mean a
[1:20:22] more sure where Peter than to be able to
[1:20:24] see Jesus glorified he said yes right
[1:20:27] why
[1:20:29] because he had a personal experience in
[1:20:31] Jesus Christ amen inside of him right
[1:20:34] that's right so he was a Jehovah of the
[1:20:37] old
[1:20:39] and there's only one bride
[1:20:45] I'm just married to Christ
[1:20:50] Those Old Testament Saints Peter James
[1:20:52] John
[1:20:56] when they came in too
[1:20:59] by the new birth
[1:21:02] that's what I've always tried to get you
[1:21:03] to see about Daniel 7 weeks people I've
[1:21:05] never seen
[1:21:08] Gentiles that always an individual an
[1:21:12] individual an individual amen whereas
[1:21:15] Israel is a whole right right why did
[1:21:18] Peter walk out there and say I mean
[1:21:20] Jesus welcome after Peter come on
[1:21:23] Jake
[1:21:26] John
[1:21:30] Mary come on
[1:21:35] because he would prove that was going to
[1:21:36] be a gentile disregation
[1:21:38] which means Jews can come into this
[1:21:40] dispensation but when they come into
[1:21:42] this dispensation they're automatically
[1:21:44] born again right a true Jew
[1:21:47] right and us old Gentiles with clubs on
[1:21:49] her back and automatically become the
[1:21:51] children of God
[1:21:52] about a new birth
[1:21:57] but when those Old Testaments was taken
[1:21:59] saints were taken up
[1:22:01] run around and said he went straight up
[1:22:04] and said he went up and he fell down
[1:22:07] before the father
[1:22:10] and he said father
[1:22:12] it's finished
[1:22:14] I've done the work
[1:22:17] was that two Gods one sitting up here
[1:22:19] and one down here
[1:22:21] or was it manifestations of the same God
[1:22:23] right
[1:22:28] he clowned upon the throne of surround
[1:22:30] right
[1:22:33] in the end time he leaves the throne
[1:22:35] some way mysteriously and the prophet
[1:22:37] said goes behind the throne or is back
[1:22:39] there said he walks out
[1:22:41] the lamb and said he takes the book out
[1:22:44] of the handle the one sitting upon the
[1:22:46] throne
[1:22:49] and the one sitting upon the throne is
[1:22:51] the father
[1:22:54] that's right your Prophet stepped down
[1:22:57] to seven Church ages it has been Son of
[1:22:59] God Amen
[1:23:01] right
[1:23:03] the father's strong Spirit right the new
[1:23:06] birth right so we are married to him
[1:23:13] the day you receive that new birth
[1:23:16] you're married to Almighty Jehovah God
[1:23:23] you ain't made your connection with the
[1:23:25] son of man yet
[1:23:29] that's right the lamb don't come to
[1:23:31] Earth anymore he stood here
[1:23:34] right 2 000 years ago and walking short
[1:23:36] of Galilee and said I'm the son of man
[1:23:43] Son of God
[1:23:45] said he come in the baptism where the
[1:23:47] Holy Ghost is the Son of God down
[1:23:49] Through the Ages
[1:23:51] that he's sitting on the throne
[1:23:55] he said one day you become the lamb
[1:23:58] is that another God
[1:24:01] and you missed what I said while ago
[1:24:03] because he picked out some of those Old
[1:24:05] Testament Saints
[1:24:07] and he Keystone them in himself
[1:24:11] you understand what I mean he stood
[1:24:13] between the old and the new yeah
[1:24:17] he picked that people out of the Old
[1:24:19] Testament as individuals
[1:24:21] to come in
[1:24:23] he gave those individuals the baptism of
[1:24:26] the Holy Ghost
[1:24:27] and then he come on over towards you and
[1:24:29] I
[1:24:31] what a wonderful thing
[1:24:34] no wonder he said to that little woman
[1:24:36] when he said to her you know she said
[1:24:38] you know give us he said it's not right
[1:24:40] for me to take the children's bread the
[1:24:43] true Jews the Israelites and give it to
[1:24:46] the dogs you've got your gentiles
[1:24:50] she said you're right Lord
[1:24:53] looks at the dogs
[1:24:56] yes the crows that fall from the Masters
[1:25:00] table amen what did he say he looked
[1:25:05] back and heard he said I haven't found a
[1:25:07] revelation in Israel like you have
[1:25:10] you reminded him that he was coming out
[1:25:13] of good gentiles
[1:25:14] because she was a gentile
[1:25:16] that's right we said I hadn't found that
[1:25:19] kind of Revelation that kind of faith in
[1:25:20] all Israel
[1:25:23] she reminded him what he come to do he
[1:25:26] gave her what she asked for didn't it
[1:25:29] his black sister Hattie Wright still
[1:25:31] that day and said there ain't nothing
[1:25:33] but the truth and God said give her what
[1:25:35] she asked for amen
[1:25:38] amen you and I get that to where we can
[1:25:40] put everything we got on this word
[1:25:43] then we can speak it too right amen
[1:25:45] believed it amen amen and then we'll get
[1:25:49] a brother saying
[1:25:50] he said brother Dale he said
[1:25:52] I've been to the Tabernacle and seen God
[1:25:55] do things
[1:25:59] but he said absolutely in God in your
[1:26:01] life and said what's the difference all
[1:26:03] right
[1:26:05] in the goddess in your life and the God
[1:26:07] that was at the Tabernacle God you know
[1:26:09] what he got what he asked for right
[1:26:13] listen Church
[1:26:15] I'm not trying to split this thing up
[1:26:16] and make half a dozen weddings
[1:26:19] I'm trying to get it all tied together
[1:26:22] where it won't be confusing see we are
[1:26:24] married and we'll read another couple
[1:26:26] quotes we're married to Christ the word
[1:26:28] all right that's right right now
[1:26:30] marrying children to her husband
[1:26:33] who is the word amen amen
[1:26:37] but we're going one day not to just a
[1:26:39] marriage sufferer to celebrate that
[1:26:42] I will be one
[1:26:44] but we're going to a marriage in the sky
[1:26:48] do you not together
[1:26:52] and when we get there he's going to be
[1:26:54] who the son
[1:26:56] of the son of God
[1:26:59] it's like I've always preached to you
[1:27:00] what is Jesus going to be when we get
[1:27:01] there he'll be almighty God there won't
[1:27:03] be a pillar of fire over here and a
[1:27:04] little Cloud floating around here and
[1:27:06] all of these things it'll be there we'll
[1:27:08] see him as he is because the Bible said
[1:27:10] we'll be like him amen we're going to be
[1:27:12] in glorified bodies with him
[1:27:15] and that's the secret that people don't
[1:27:17] know that's right I don't want a fool
[1:27:19] with
[1:27:20] yep
[1:27:21] you would have someone to ask the
[1:27:23] question
[1:27:24] was talking about that the bride would
[1:27:26] go to the marriage supper for three and
[1:27:28] a half years and they said where do we
[1:27:29] go after the end
[1:27:32] see they didn't like the seven year
[1:27:33] periods and the different things they
[1:27:35] said where do we go after then
[1:27:39] right around tells you where you go
[1:27:42] where did
[1:27:49] who isn't it Isaac
[1:27:53] where did Isaac and Rebecca go after
[1:27:55] they got married
[1:27:57] honeymoon
[1:28:01] you're not getting the story
[1:28:04] they went to the father's house
[1:28:10] right
[1:28:12] we've got something coming it folks that
[1:28:14] you don't realize what's going on but we
[1:28:17] got our own ideas and we should try to
[1:28:19] sort out things and make it here right
[1:28:23] but we're married to him
[1:28:26] the Christ
[1:28:28] but when you start dealing as the next
[1:28:30] quote does when you start dealing with
[1:28:32] son of man
[1:28:35] you're dealing with the bride being the
[1:28:37] fullness or the godhead bodily
[1:28:40] when you're dealing with with uh John
[1:28:43] what is it uh Luke no Luke 17 30. in the
[1:28:46] days when the son of man is to be
[1:28:48] revealed everybody puts that in brother
[1:28:50] Brown
[1:28:52] well I thought according to the Book of
[1:28:54] Revelations about chapter 13 12 or 13 of
[1:28:57] verse 1 I mean chapter one that the one
[1:29:00] standing in the midst of seven golden
[1:29:01] Candlestick was like unto the son of man
[1:29:03] gird about the path for the golden
[1:29:06] girdle and I thought that was the
[1:29:07] feminist party man of the bride of
[1:29:10] Christ
[1:29:12] yep
[1:29:15] you see why I want to get away from
[1:29:17] preaching about what's going to happen
[1:29:19] I don't want to talk about what we are
[1:29:24] there's a lot of things going to happen
[1:29:28] but just finding about organized
[1:29:30] religion ain't gonna put us in a rapture
[1:29:32] a pope coming out of the United States
[1:29:34] ain't gonna put us in a rapture all
[1:29:36] right
[1:29:37] that's what everybody thinks
[1:29:42] this guy could be killed tomorrow to
[1:29:43] meet two out of the United States that
[1:29:45] still wouldn't put us in the rapture
[1:29:51] I thought Rapture and Faith laid in the
[1:29:53] message of the hour
[1:29:56] remember that it is but the rest is an
[1:29:58] hour said that every month by the United
[1:29:59] States praise the Lord
[1:30:06] but the Bible had spoken many times
[1:30:09] Isaiah 42 blame I believe it's 42
[1:30:12] brainly plainly describes what John the
[1:30:15] Baptist would do when he stood on Earth
[1:30:19] right
[1:30:20] but when he stood there how many people
[1:30:22] believed right
[1:30:24] come on how many people believe me when
[1:30:26] he stood on earth and the Bible had said
[1:30:28] he would do that yeah
[1:30:29] and Jesus even referred to him
[1:30:33] right right Jesus gave him the greatest
[1:30:36] coat the compliments could ever be
[1:30:39] and acquire him to be who he was right
[1:30:41] amen and how many people believed it
[1:30:45] I mean even the disciples that had sit
[1:30:47] and listened to Jesus talk about John
[1:30:52] why did the Bible says yeah
[1:30:56] you didn't know it
[1:30:58] didn't they said oh he's not about John
[1:31:00] the Baptist they finally caught on
[1:31:03] but listen Church let's just read these
[1:31:05] few quotes because it won't be too
[1:31:06] lonely
[1:31:07] let's read sometimes
[1:31:09] we'll go ahead to number three
[1:31:11] these are taken proven his word in 1964
[1:31:14] 816 run it up to where and just get the
[1:31:17] bottom and that day sure the son of man
[1:31:19] be revealed what to join the church to
[1:31:20] the Head

[1:31:27] we're already married to him as
[1:31:31] Father Strong Spirit right
[1:31:34] and we're going to get so close here
[1:31:36] until
[1:31:40] you read it
[1:31:42] that day the son of man will be revealed
[1:31:45] what to join the church to the Head
[1:31:50] Dr Ashman said well we're getting
[1:31:51] married going to be the headstone to the
[1:31:53] church I said I ain't going to tell you

[1:32:07] the son of man and a uniting upon earth

[1:32:14] realize why it says and the wife
[1:32:17] the wife
[1:32:19] is the son of man on Earth in the bride

[1:32:26] married about a new birth but we're in a
[1:32:28] wonderful ceremony time a wonderful
[1:32:31] uniting with the word a wonderful time
[1:32:33] with our savior and our Master but we're
[1:32:36] still going to a marriage supper and
[1:32:38] we're still going to a wedding in the

[1:33:00] right
[1:33:01] right through the head uniting with the
[1:33:04] bride
[1:33:04] I believe the headstone to the Bride of
[1:33:07] Jesus Christ is the opening of those
[1:33:09] Seven Seals amen the message of the
[1:33:11] Prophet from 63 on going upward
[1:33:15] that's your adoption that's your all of
[1:33:17] your coverings amen all right
[1:33:20] when the son of man will come down and
[1:33:22] come in human flesh how does it run
[1:33:24] around but what about our flesh do you
[1:33:27] not the two together don't let Brian
[1:33:29] ain't talking about Mr Prophet right the
[1:33:31] church has to be the word he is the word
[1:33:33] unto you not together and to do that
[1:33:35] it'll take the manifestation of the
[1:33:37] revealing of the son of man not a
[1:33:39] clergyman
[1:33:40] okay not one person but we're not a
[1:33:43] clergyman
[1:33:44] and I don't know you see what I mean see
[1:33:47] it's son of man Jesus Christ will come
[1:33:50] down in human flesh Among Us and will
[1:33:53] make his word so real that he'll unite
[1:33:56] the church in him as one the bride and

[1:34:35] supper
[1:34:36] okay now
[1:34:39] when the word here
[1:34:42] unites with the person and they too
[1:34:45] become one and then what does it do then
[1:34:47] it manifests the son of man again not
[1:34:50] the church theologians your son of man
[1:34:52] the word of God
[1:34:54] and the church becomes one what so
[1:34:57] whatever the son of man done he was the

[1:39:04] but we're going to start just a minute
[1:39:06] and just try to pick up something
[1:39:10] but get the point if I have to cut off
[1:39:12] on this and start Wednesday
[1:39:15] he said well you sure confused me
[1:39:19] no
[1:39:22] I don't see anything confuse you
[1:39:26] I tried to prove that we're already
[1:39:28] married to Jesus Christ
[1:39:33] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:36] that's only the marital part of the Soul
[1:39:41] right right
[1:39:43] we're not married to him yet in body
[1:39:49] you hear somebody say I don't have no
[1:39:51] more trouble with my body then you've
[1:39:52] got somebody that's done the devil's
[1:39:54] done got them so just forget it
[1:39:57] that's right is that too hard
[1:40:00] no it's just true
[1:40:03] we're married to Christ
[1:40:05] by being married to Christ then we're
[1:40:07] going to the wedding supper
[1:40:10] and that wedding supper is going to be
[1:40:11] in the sky
[1:40:13] right all right
[1:40:16] but see we're being married now to the
[1:40:18] son of man
[1:40:22] the bride becoming the word may flesh
[1:40:25] upon Earth
[1:40:27] she's being married now right to the
[1:40:30] word This is the End Time bride this is
[1:40:32] not all of the Bride down Through the
[1:40:34] Ages all of the Bride down Through the
[1:40:35] Ages is married to Christ the word by
[1:40:37] the baptism of the Holy Ghost everybody
[1:40:38] understand that is it married to Christ
[1:40:40] the word and will be God but there's
[1:40:42] going to be an end time group of people
[1:40:45] that hath made herself ready right
[1:40:51] right
[1:40:53] made herself ready
[1:40:56] how can you make yourself ready brother
[1:40:58] Dale I thought God made us ready
[1:41:01] I agree with you
[1:41:05] but that's the same thing we're going to
[1:41:06] read here in a second where the the
[1:41:08] armor meat packet
[1:41:10] story all you ever hear preached is
[1:41:14] that that little girl saved all of her
[1:41:16] dimes and nickels
[1:41:18] you don't hear that he sent her money
[1:41:20] you ever heard that say it
[1:41:23] oh
[1:41:26] let's just see
[1:41:29] look at the message God's keeping his
[1:41:30] word so we're going to get on the bride
[1:41:32] is made ourselves ready and he'll use
[1:41:34] right like I told you there's only one
[1:41:35] actual quote where that wrote around
[1:41:37] uses a wife
[1:41:39] that's my intercept ready and I'll I'll
[1:41:41] give it to you because I don't have it
[1:41:42] on the plane it's in the Revelation
[1:41:45] chapter four uh part 1 16-12 31. he's
[1:41:51] talking about Revelation 19 Begins the
[1:41:52] seventh verse this is when the church
[1:41:54] appears again
[1:41:56] never appeared again until over in the
[1:41:59] 19th Chapter and he reads the scripture
[1:42:01] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:42:03] honor to him for the marriage of the
[1:42:04] Lamb that's come and his wife has made
[1:42:06] herself ready
[1:42:08] and I could preach on that till midnight
[1:42:10] and not have television look his wife
[1:42:13] has made herself ready that's the only
[1:42:15] quote that didn't find it he said have
[1:42:17] or has
[1:42:18] but he'll use Brides to watch
[1:42:21] from the message God keeping his word
[1:42:23] 57.
[1:42:25] I got 77. but God was determined God was
[1:42:29] determined that his word would not
[1:42:30] return to him he was going to keep his
[1:42:32] word he has to keep his word and he must
[1:42:34] do it in order to be God if he has to
[1:42:36] make it make a change of anything and by
[1:42:40] the grace he will do it that's the
[1:42:42] reason I say if the church does not get
[1:42:44] herself ready
[1:42:46] that's your duty
[1:42:50] right to get ready
[1:42:57] I got the Holy Ghost
[1:42:59] amen
[1:43:02] what kind of a wife are you
[1:43:11] you got the Holy Ghost makes you alive
[1:43:13] what kind of a wife are you well it
[1:43:15] don't make no difference what I do I'm
[1:43:16] ready to go
[1:43:18] well you know what that means
[1:43:20] we don't go
[1:43:30] you might have the paperwork but what's
[1:43:32] your wife doing well that'd be something
[1:43:34] to come home there's a lot of in there
[1:43:35] and run around my brain where he said
[1:43:37] wouldn't it be something to come home to
[1:43:38] your wife cheat out flirting around a
[1:43:40] bunch of men
[1:43:41] I don't live with them while you're
[1:43:43] going to work
[1:43:45] would that be a good wife
[1:43:46] you know she got the paper said she just
[1:43:48] wanted but the Bible says she's dead
[1:43:51] while she's living
[1:43:54] am I right
[1:43:56] had to make a change if your church does
[1:43:58] not get herself ready that's your duty
[1:44:00] to get ready the bride has made herself
[1:44:03] ready the Garment is packed garments is
[1:44:05] paid for they are ready but you must be
[1:44:08] ready to wire those garments the church
[1:44:11] has made herself ready
[1:44:14] you've got to be ready look at your next
[1:44:16] one let's read facts
[1:44:18] this is God's provided way
[1:44:21] 59 paragraph Eve 54. you remember the
[1:44:25] Bible said in the bride has made herself
[1:44:27] ready
[1:44:28] and the road to the righteousness of the
[1:44:30] Saints you see so that little girl only
[1:44:32] got 25 cents a week
[1:44:35] armor meat packing situation right the
[1:44:38] guy comes out to get it and that's the
[1:44:40] background
[1:44:43] oh but oh how happy she was that year
[1:44:45] just washing and singing and saving
[1:44:48] every penny she could rest of them went
[1:44:50] to town and bought them packs of
[1:44:51] cigarettes and want more you know and
[1:44:53] they're whiskey and carry on new decks
[1:44:56] of cards and had their big time but she
[1:45:00] just labored away why she was getting
[1:45:03] ready making herself ready you remember
[1:45:06] in the Book of Ruth Ruth ladybird sure
[1:45:10] until she got the six measures a meal
[1:45:13] right and then she rested right amen
[1:45:19] and then finally first thing you know
[1:45:22] she got to town
[1:45:24] she got the wedding garment
[1:45:27] and got the money that he sent her
[1:45:32] how are you reading it and got the money
[1:45:35] he sent her
[1:45:37] now
[1:45:39] see it's not her doing everything
[1:45:44] but it's not him doing everything right
[1:45:48] he's giving us the garments but we got
[1:45:50] to put him on
[1:45:52] he gave us eternal life remember I said
[1:45:55] he gave us the gifts he gave us some
[1:45:56] things
[1:45:58] but we got to put them on
[1:46:01] what I said a while ago trying to
[1:46:03] explain it
[1:46:04] salvation is of the Lord Jonah 209 I
[1:46:07] believe that's right
[1:46:08] you don't have anything to do with the
[1:46:10] Salvation you receive with Jesus Christ
[1:46:11] except the fact you accept it amen the
[1:46:14] rest of it is a free gift but from then
[1:46:16] on you better start doing some working
[1:46:20] like Ruth
[1:46:22] you better start laboring
[1:46:25] you better start studying and praying
[1:46:28] yeah right right that's all I've
[1:46:31] encourage people to do you know if you
[1:46:33] study and pray you don't have to worry
[1:46:34] about somebody deceiving you
[1:46:38] you can say Hey brother that ain't right
[1:46:41] but look
[1:46:43] the money he sent her and got the
[1:46:46] wedding garment and come back
[1:46:48] to all she had put with all he gave her
[1:46:52] she come back ready to get married
[1:46:57] she made herself ready go ahead in the
[1:47:00] next one
[1:47:03] the marriage or the excuse me of the
[1:47:05] Lamb preaching 62 121 the evening
[1:47:08] paragraph 53. and we know that there's
[1:47:10] going to be a bride and there's going to
[1:47:12] be a wedding supper served in disguise
[1:47:15] that's just as sure to be as God is
[1:47:17] because it's his word and we know that
[1:47:20] those that are going to make up that
[1:47:22] bride is going to be his church and
[1:47:25] they're going to appear before him
[1:47:26] without spot or wrinkle and they have
[1:47:29] the material on earth now to make
[1:47:32] themselves ready I love that quote so we
[1:47:36] don't need another Prophet we don't need
[1:47:38] somebody to tell us where the Prophet
[1:47:41] was wrong
[1:47:42] is that what he said yes right the
[1:47:45] material is on earth now if you notice
[1:47:47] she has made herself already
[1:47:49] so many says if the Lord will take this
[1:47:52] evil spirit from me now once you
[1:47:55] illustrating she's made herself ready
[1:47:58] if the Lord will take this and he's ever
[1:48:01] said that this evil spirit from me from
[1:48:04] drinking or from gambling or from lying
[1:48:06] or stealing I'll serve him
[1:48:11] but that's up to you you got to do
[1:48:14] something
[1:48:16] to
[1:48:18] they had overcome children heard all
[1:48:20] things made it overcome
[1:48:23] you have power to do it but you must be
[1:48:26] willing to lay it down
[1:48:28] she has made herself ready I'll take
[1:48:31] that word you see God could not push you
[1:48:34] push us through a little pipe
[1:48:39] pull us out on the other end
[1:48:41] and then saying blessed in he that
[1:48:44] overcome it that's right
[1:48:48] I thought God done everything he put us
[1:48:50] any pool tonight he said we couldn't say
[1:48:53] we're Overcomer these Church Angels do
[1:48:55] the overcoming right in the back of
[1:48:57] church
[1:48:58] they had nothing to overcome he just
[1:49:00] pushed us through but you've got to make
[1:49:03] decisions for yourself I have to make
[1:49:05] decisions for myself I'm doing that we
[1:49:08] show our funny and respect to God you
[1:49:12] get it yes
[1:49:13] man he said that's up to you
[1:49:17] got a couple more that's all right I'll
[1:49:19] paraphrase it is he said the hour has
[1:49:22] come
[1:49:23] the bride is made herself
[1:49:25] ready oh my made herself ready she laid
[1:49:28] aside all of the things
[1:49:31] remember Esther was chosen
[1:49:34] and the others were rejected
[1:49:37] no one was Esther Jones
[1:49:42] the brightest that made herself ready we
[1:49:44] got the potential the holy spirit is
[1:49:46] here God is here the power to heal the
[1:49:48] sick all of these things
[1:49:51] right in his his wife has made herself
[1:49:54] ready at the End of the Age
[1:49:57] no way through right
[1:50:00] that's on the message birth pains
[1:50:01] started out 196.
[1:50:03] how did she make herself ready to
[1:50:06] becoming his wife and what does she what
[1:50:09] kind of a garment has she got on
[1:50:12] his own words right amen
[1:50:15] think about it
[1:50:21] please expecting us to put this word on
[1:50:23] this garment amen the righteousness of
[1:50:27] the Saints
[1:50:30] but I want to State it one more time
[1:50:32] then
[1:50:33] we're married to Christ by the new bird
[1:50:35] amen right and we're going to the
[1:50:37] marriage supper
[1:50:39] there will be one
[1:50:43] all right
[1:50:44] but now we are being united to the word
[1:50:47] of the hour this end time people
[1:50:50] not down to the ages the end time people
[1:50:53] a day without us cannot be made perfect
[1:50:54] that's that's the dependability upon you
[1:50:56] and I for that part
[1:50:58] and
[1:51:01] we're going to the marriage of the Lamb
[1:51:05] that says
[1:51:06] he said it is come it's there we're
[1:51:08] going to the marriage
[1:51:10] now
[1:51:16] think about it
[1:51:18] when we go out here in a rapture
[1:51:20] Israel is going to strike a tribulation
[1:51:22] period now for three and a half years
[1:51:25] while we are at the prophet ship
[1:51:28] marriage supper
[1:51:31] you know what that means that means we
[1:51:33] got married somewhere
[1:51:40] that's not the marriage of the Lamb
[1:51:44] the marriage of the Lamb is a revealed
[1:51:46] word our son of man
[1:51:51] you couldn't do that until the end time
[1:51:52] so there's only the end time bride is
[1:51:54] dealing with the son of man they never
[1:51:56] dealt with it down to the ages none of
[1:51:58] the writers even in the scripture spoke
[1:52:00] with the son of man that's right I ain't
[1:52:01] talking about Matthew Mark Luke and John
[1:52:03] in the recording that was what Jesus
[1:52:05] said no writings of Paul Peter Etc
[1:52:07] mentioned son of man right John goes
[1:52:11] over to Patmos and come back to the one
[1:52:13] like unto the son of man
[1:52:18] the church we got a wedding to go to
[1:52:20] amen
[1:52:22] and then we got a marriage supper after
[1:52:24] the wedding
[1:52:28] so we're going to get married when we
[1:52:29] meet him in the sky
[1:52:33] that's right
[1:52:36] just as Isaac and Rebecca
[1:52:39] got married
[1:52:46] and then it went to the father's house
[1:52:50] and they had a wedding supper
[1:52:52] it was a beautiful thing right around
[1:52:54] said there'll be a table foreign
[1:52:56] thousands of miles long
[1:52:59] listen to me
[1:53:02] he said we'll be standing at that table
[1:53:06] he said we'll look across that table and
[1:53:08] we'll see those brothers and sisters
[1:53:10] that made it and say there
[1:53:16] is Mark
[1:53:22] Richard Marlo
[1:53:26] now you say there ain't gonna be no
[1:53:28] crying in heaven that's right you better
[1:53:30] change your mind because I can quote
[1:53:33] real good the prophet said there'll be
[1:53:35] tears running down her cheek said he
[1:53:39] will come
[1:53:40] and walk away the tears from her eyes
[1:53:43] and say Well done
[1:53:44] done no good and faithful sir now enter
[1:53:47] into the things that have been prepared
[1:53:49] for you from the foundation of the world
[1:53:50] that's right and
[1:53:53] there's going to be a marriage in this
[1:53:55] Heaven amen that's right
[1:53:58] you see one when they would preach it
[1:54:00] and say we're getting we're married now
[1:54:01] they ain't gonna be marriage and no
[1:54:02] marriage in heaven
[1:54:04] that didn't ring with me real good
[1:54:08] I just I can't explain it so I
[1:54:12] in a better way against
[1:54:15] but see now I can see there's going to
[1:54:17] be a marriage in the sky
[1:54:21] when we meet him in the air
[1:54:24] is going to be a marriage
[1:54:27] and he's going to take us to the
[1:54:28] marriage supper and we're going to have
[1:54:30] a wonderful time and there's going to be
[1:54:32] a little period of time there's kind of
[1:54:34] blanks out there
[1:54:37] because Israel is going to precede us
[1:54:40] into the Millennium and build a
[1:54:41] millennium Temple that's where most
[1:54:43] people don't even believe that that's
[1:54:45] what your Prophet said he said to
[1:54:46] Ezekiel 40 to 44 was the Millennium
[1:54:48] temple being erected on Earth
[1:54:53] and you know what then after a while we
[1:54:55] come riding
[1:54:56] we'll get to that Wednesday Lord with us
[1:54:59] we come riding back with him come on
[1:55:01] musician
[1:55:03] into the Millennium that's right
[1:55:07] a wonderful story
[1:55:11] truly then we will be
[1:55:14] the bride
[1:55:16] the wife that has made herself ready
[1:55:19] bro that's why when John gets on over
[1:55:22] we'll get back to it later when he gets
[1:55:24] on over to make sure that you don't have
[1:55:25] no loophole John gets over and and the
[1:55:28] angel says to John said come and I'll
[1:55:31] show you the bride the Lamb's wife
[1:55:37] that don't leave nobody out
[1:55:43] Don't Leave Nobody out that's right the
[1:55:45] bride is all down to the ages
[1:55:51] the laugh is the maturity of the
[1:55:53] of the end time bride
