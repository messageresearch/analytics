of widows and orphans and the uh ones like the leprosy and all like that and we just appreciate it appreciate all the work they're doing and the things but we appreciate most of all the word amen so let's believe all right next thing is our brother comes to minister unto us open the eyes of my heart open i want to see you is oh let's pray together heavenly father one more time we come to the throne of grace this afternoon we thank you lord for the blessings this day you've given to us already we're looking forward to hear from you one more time from the father come on the scene and speak to our hearts lord take the word of life and break into our hearts lord anoint the speaker and the hearers of your word speak to us father meet our needs and be thankful by faith in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen if you like me i'd like you to commit me to the book of saint luke chapter 22. i would like to read words 31 and 32. saint luke chapter 22 verse 31 and 32. and the lord said simon simon behold satan has desired to have you that you may sift you as sweet but i have prayed for thee that thy faith failed not and then thou art converted strengthened thy brethren may the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word thank you very much you all made me sick this morning we were talking about undisputed value undisputed value of faith right amen this afternoon the lord willing i would like to speak on i'd like to speak on when faith fails i the lord was dealing with my heart i woke up this morning and i wanted to because i asked yesterday brothers dale and i said uh brother daley would like to take the morning service because i knew there was a visitor wednesday and he said no no you're going to have both the service yeah i said okay so i wake up four o'clock maybe because of the fear or you know how it is you know to preach to services and i began to pray and ask the lord to lead me and the lord laid on my heart and i believe um he will bless us one more time amen and i would like to go on the positive side it may looks like a negative title for the subject when faith fails but i would like to go on the positive side of it and see that our faith doesn't fail right and we saw this morning that the faith will bring results fear has no value right right right he has no value right now but faith can bring results right amen faith can move mountains but when that faith fails then we are in deep trouble i like to just show few certain things what the prophet has said you know about faith when faith fails and this particular scripture we look at uh peter yeah we spoke little about peter this morning but peter was a key man peter had the revelation right he had the right revelation and the revelation was confirmed by the lord jesus christ because jesus said peter flesh and blood had not revealed it unto you but my father which is in heaven had revealed it unto you so he had the right revelation he had it from the right source and the revelation was right and being confirmed by the lord himself right amen what a blessed thing that was right and nobody had revelation about jesus christ he wasn't he was a preacher peter was a preacher peter had received the the power on demons to cast away right and he had the power to heal sickness sick people were healed through his ministry but um a man of this caliber a man of this cattle when you think about peter you know having the keys of the kingdom of god right having the authority keys means the power the authority right and having the authority of the kingdom of god you know heaven and the doors being you know he he could unlose it and he can bind it he can close it he could shed it he had the power in his hand that's the reason you know when he was filled with the holy ghost he was the first one to stand up right and to speak what he was doing he was unlocking the doors of him he was unlocking the doors of heaven so that the bride of jesus christ could enter in exactly you know he was a great man he was an important man but you know devil desired him to heaven and heaven and not only that and he was sitting him like wheat i don't know whether he you know about it not because this country is a country of technology with machines but you know when we in india when we go through the field and have our harvest uh complete you know that's the time some of the people who are poor doesn't have machines to do we got good tractors now we got good uh uh you know harvest machines and that can separate the wheat and the ch and the chaff but you know in the india when i was a little boy or in my young age um of course i'm not old now i'm still a young man according to your american standard i'm just a kid right right so you know so you know when i was growing up in my tens i i've seen people you know taking the the the harvest and trying to you know put it spread it and and the oxen will will walk upon them right you know and and that will bring the grain out of the shaft but sometimes the grain had the uh shaft over it so what they used to do you know they used to beat upon the upon the thing and then they take a uh take uh a fan you know we got a certain certain way we have it that we put the seeds in it grains in it and you know people begin to to sift you know when when they save because of the wind you know the shaft used to fly away and the wheat stays in the in the you know the devil is a cheat he's a liar we know that right we know that the devil has no authority over us but we should be very careful he has an access right anywhere he want to that's what the prophet said right right you know there was a meeting going on conference going on one time in heaven when the sons of god came to to their father to the heavenly father and they were talking and and then slowly you know this guy guys sneaked in right he came inside and you know the lord saw him they said hi friend how are you said i'm flying he said where are you going from where are you coming he said who i'm from you know all over the world so he has access all over the world whether you are indian african american australian chinese or japanese whatever he access he have an access every place every continent on this place of this earth but he also has access into the presence of god now that's what the scripture is teaching us right and if he has an access into the kingdom of god then he has access over in our homes to come inside of our homes he has access to us he can come and talk to us he can come and whisper to us and that's the time we can you know be an ignorant we can be a little bit foolish in our thinking and we can be a little discouraged or you know broken sometimes because of our situation and we can fall into the trap of the devil right and he can have us and he can have us and he can move us and he can you know you can he can do whatever he wants to do but you know brother sister that's what was happening to peter because jesus being god in flesh the word became flesh he knew what was going to happen in the future in the near future when he was about to be caught by the by the roman people and and he was to be crucified and he knew what was exactly happening you know in few days later time and and he knew that peter would just deny him right he knew what was the situation peter was to go and you know but thank god that god saw his future god saw what is going to happen in the near future and what did jesus do he just not let him go but he prayed for him right oh i'm so thankful to the lord my lord because he prayed for peter and i believe my brother my sister my brother my my bible tells me he not only prayed for peter but he prayed for us too he plainly says that he doesn't pray for the people of the world but he prays for the people who have given to me amen praise we believe we are his children we are these people and the prayer has been made all right all right aren't you glad for that right i would like to just talk to this little young man young sisters and young brothers you know sometimes you are mischievous sometimes you are naughty sometimes you are disobedient i'm not trying to put you all down but you know this is what i came through that i was naughty i will mischievous you know not bad but a good one you know every we give hard times to our father and mother you know sometimes we are grown up people like this and sometimes we give out time to the pastor my sister we give hard time we're human beings you know sometimes we become mischievous sometimes we become naughty but let me tell you one thing you know somebody is praying for us right fastly you know it is not them it is the spirit in them that rides the automobile see but you know nothing happens to us why yeah we break the law sometimes nothing happens to us sometimes we are close to an accident but nothing happens to us why because somebody your father or your mother is praying for you amen are you listening to me somebody's praying amen remember your pastor is praying for your dear man amen ah every time he thinks about you he prays for you because he cares for you he loves you he cares for yourself right thank god that jesus prayed for peter amen that's right i want to read something very astounding you will be i i know you might have uh you might have read that you know i don't say you didn't read or didn't hear but i would like to tell you uh brother branham speaking about about peter and he said when jesus prayed for peter said i will pray that your faith fail not listen to me very carefully this is the words of the prophet he said i will pray that your faith fail not not is more else because they did yeah yeah think about it right jesus was concerned about his faith more than anything am i glory right and according to the statement the prophet meant he did fail in his mortals that's what peter yeah i'm sure amen with such a great ministry such a great power operating in his ministry healing the sea casting out demons you know raising the dead raising the lamb laying in all kinds of things but jesus was praying for his faith peter let not your faith fail right amen because that's the dangerous thing you can you can think of the prophet of god says remember as long as the fate lasts as long as when your faith is lasting when your faith fails then your experience is gone your experience with god is finished right it's based that way simply upon the finished words of christ at calvary you know we need to keep up our faith because once your faith is failing your experience with god fails your healing will fail right right amen your joy will fail right your stability in christian life will fail right your whole thing fails right because faith is the foundation right now brother sam has come here from india and trying to teach us abc yeah yeah but brother sister sometimes abc is very good you know it sounds funny it sounds you know hey this is we have learned in uh kindergarten which is good yeah but sometimes you know when you do mathematics you know you you have to look for a formula which you learned in second third class sometimes if you forget that formula you cannot finish this uh this uh problem right whatever you call you know if you lose that formula right right so sometimes we think this formula is too basic but brother sister you know faith is the foundation where we stand right and the faith we have is of god and the faith is victorious faith can bring results faith can change a situation faith can remove mountains you know faith is the greatest thing by faith we can counter everything we can have everything by faith but when this faith fails man we are in great trouble look what he says uh sometimes you know a weak person weak in faith came to the prophet of god and and he he began to talk to brother branham and he said you know what i think i don't have enough faith because i cannot keep my healing you know and and he was discouraged that brother reno was talking about that man and he was discouraged and he began to say you know you know what the basis of divine healing is not on the same level as on salvation right think about that but salvation when you receive jesus christ you are born again and you are you are you have an immortal life that cannot perish or get old it can never die right okay it's just finished forever when you're born of the spirit of god but he said this body it gets sick it becomes weak god helps us heals us we get sick again and it's just temporarily until the journey is finished but salvation is permanent right forever amen that doesn't fail right so salvation is totally different right sometimes we become discouraged because we are sick again the sickness doesn't lean and this man came to the prophet and he said you know what being disconnected he said i don't think i've got enough faith you know because i lost my healing and then the prophet goes forward and he says you cannot lose your healing right because jesus protested right it is yours the only thing we like is we don't claim it just like our sister was testifying he she claims she claims her brother whosoever it is she claims him right and brother sister you know we need to have enough faith first for ourselves and we apply token for ourselves if we have faith we apply the token and then we can apply the token by the same faith we have for ourselves what our loved ones that's what person is talking about we can apply the token against their wish right absolutely amen sure what a blessing what a blessedness we can apply the token against their wish of they hate this message you can still apply amen you can still apply the token but they hate this church you can still apply the token but they hate this bastard you can still apply the token brother sister it way it is not our life it is not our doings it is not our goodness it is not our righteousness but the faith we have today glory if the faith has saved us it can't save anything and you can claim your loved ones you can clean your logo that's right i will tell you one thing my wife she cries for her for her brother her brother is the only brother she got and she always cries for him because he doesn't go to church because he doesn't serve the lord her mother was praying she's going to be with the lord a very good believer but she's going to be with the lord but she always prayed day and night oh god i pray for my son i pray for my son lord bring him lord save his soul and you know sometimes they cry and the family meets they cry and they're discouraged you know and they're broken and one day i came i said you know what i would like to tell you one thing you people are praying but i don't think you got enough faith because i feel you're discouraged your hearts are being broken and you think there is no hope but let me tell you your prayers are not going away no prayers will not go anywhere right if you want to see that exactly go to revelation chapter 5 you can see god pouring out learning you know from the russian right now and he said that's the prayers of the same right brother sister someday your prayer will catch amen we'll catch that person that prayer will help that person that prayer will take hold of that soul one day brother your prayer will not go anywhere amen but the question is are you praying right right come on brother the question is are we praying the bible says pray without ceasing amen the bible says let the men raise their holy hands right and pray amen hallelujah like we need you you don't you don't take this thing as is right if you want to see a revival in this tabernacle rather sister only prayer can bring if you can if you want to see victory in our people's life brother only prayer can bring victory you want to see the move of god in our midst only prayer can do that if you want to see the signs and wonders only pray again but if you want to see the blessings of god only pray again if you want to see the power of god in your life only prayer we can preach what hours we can study for hours days together months together we can do anything we want to but brother sister what we need today is prayer life and the prophet of god said without the holy ghost no man can pray all right amen have you ever thought about this preaching doesn't need the holy ghost you can read five books ten books preaching doesn't need the holy ghost that's right you can have a bunch of papers and your notes like this you can come and if you cannot preach under the inspiration of the anointing you can give a good lecture amen brother sister he preached the first second sermon to mrs eve and see what he did and here you see on the other hand our brother noah preached for 100 years solid 100 years he could hardly win one soul amen just think about it so preaching doesn't need the holy ghost action he came to preach to jesus also and he began to say it is written it is written it is written that's what he told jesus when he was when he found that he was weak he fasted and prayed but brother sister jesus was the word amen and he said satan it is also written right it is also written his body was weak but his faith was strong we may be weak in our bodies we may have different sickness we may have you know disabilities in ourselves we may have you know don't have solid strong capabilities but we may be weak according to the physical situation but let me tell you our faith has got nothing to do with the situation in ourselves our faith must be strong that's right amen hallelujah oh that's wonderful amen you know to keep up this weight lord jesus tells peter he said i have prayed for thee thank god amen that he has prayed that thy faith failed not and when thou converted strengthened thy brethren when you repent of sin right when you are getting ready to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ it is just coming near you're just putting few steps you know to be to repent and to you know that's a process actually but the real conversion comes when the holy ghost comes into our lives when we are filled with the holy ghost right glory when our souls are sealed with the holy ghost praise the lord then the conversion comes why could peter lie why could peter do the things he did because he was not converted brother branham says in the message i forgot to write it's a question and answer in 64 he said you are not converted until you receive the holy ghost remember that you are only potentially converted see exactly any person that's not being filled with the holy ghost and claims himself to be a christian because he has repented of his sin yes baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and not being filled with the holy ghost he's potentially saved amen praise but the real conversion comes when he's con when he's filled with the holy ghost and that's the reason church my friends were brothers and sisters we need to be filled with the holy ghost we need to make sure yes sir that we have the holy ghost right right many people talk about just believing yeah just believing believe the message believe the message bring the message if only believing is is okay then we got a good believer right yeah mr dell yeah he believes he's right this is the only god he believes that this is the only true god he believes and he travels now we don't have that much fear sometimes we you know we are relaxed we think that oh are we we are saved we are the bride of jesus christ we are the wife of christ you know we are resting we are all israel and we don't even fear right we don't even fear his about his presence we don't fear when his word has been treated we just relax we just take things for granted you know but that man he he feels and he not only fails but he travels all right the bible says it right right but brother sister just imagine if it is just believing that mr devil will be in the rapture right but that is not so right it's not true right believing is something and being sealed with the holy ghost is something right right right just like brother branham was speaking to a person one day an intellectual ban and he talked about the religion he believed he said what can religion produce he said man i have read about god his love his goodness his power is his mighty words and his righteousness but you know one day i met him that's what the prophet said yeah so one day i met him he said when i met him reading was something else but when i met him it changed me when i met that person that's right about whom it was written it changed my life i'm no more the same person right hallelujah right that's what we need today man we need to meet that person right personally right so that we would be changed amen and then we can strengthen our brothers right amen but praise god peter he was being prayed for and i heard i don't know brother sam dale whether he knows or not i don't know must be he must be annoying but he he's a senior man in the message someone told me he said whenever the prayer uh you know all the call was made brother brennan was the first one to run and and and he started praying he was the first one to run to the altar that's what some a good good you know seasoned minister told me yeah and then i began to think about that brother branham needed prayer yeah how much more i know how much we honor praise allah amen brother sister just just see you know peter with such a great blessings in his life spiritually speaking having the revelation having that great ministry having signs and wonders following him look about the judas they came all excited happy junky so the devils have been you know we have seen devils being cast out and you know oh it is so mighty jesus said don't be happy because your names are written right right praise the lord right that's that's the thing what we need today right but you know to keep up this faith what we have to do first peter chapter five eight and ten eight through ten be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil has a ruling lion rocket about seeking whom he made we resist that devil with faith steadfast fast in faith knowing that the same affliction are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the great god of all grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by christ jesus after that he has suffered a while make you perfect establish strength the god of all grace right who have called us amen unto his eternal glory by christ jesus that after that he have suffered a little while praise the lord amen make you perfect establish strengthen and settle oh when you go through the suffering that is coming to strengthen us right oh yeah that is coming to establish us to make us perfect and settle us right amen so you know we should have a right attitude right towards the things we are suffering today exactly right and and with the right attitude if we can have and say lord jesus i want you to whip me more all right amen amen thank you for this suffering yes thank you for this disease thank you for the sickness thank you lord for this problem thank you lord for these issues in my life thank you lord for the shock comings thank you lord for the for the circumstances i'm going through you know we have the gold and and you know what does the goldsmith do he takes the gold and he beats he beats the gold and the character or the or the the quality of the gold it doesn't break right right it stretches himself the gold began to you know uh what's the right word brother spread out yeah it doesn't break into pieces the more the smith hits the more it spread and the more it's spelled the grass is going out and as the grass grows out the more shining it becomes he said he will beat the gold until he could see his own face in it and he was he will be able to shave his own face that's what the prophet said amen so if we are believers today our attitude be lord let it come i'm ready amen lord you've ripped me more right right yes lord yeah right come on with me make me perfect right establish me in my life help me to settle down amen give me the steadiness give me the firmness right lord establish my feet that's what david prayed one day he said i was saying i was in a horrible place right and i cried unto the lord and the lord hated me amen brother we cry out when we are in the pit yeah we cry out that is our tendency yeah right when the house is full the kitchen is full all the jars are full we don't need god we don't cry we don't pray because everything what we have at our fingertips everything we have come on bro but brother when the band gets empty let the pockets become empty when the jars in the kitchen room gets empty right that's the lord i will come today i will come to the hills room that's come with my help my come my heart coming from the lord amen that's why sometimes our banks are empty that's why sometimes our jars are empty sometimes the faith fails and that faith is a mental fight we don't want to have that mental faith we don't want to have the faith that comes by money when it is full in the bank because you know there's nothing to withdraw right exactly then we begin to stagger when we begin to feel bad yeah he said oh man what's happening what's happening you don't have a deposit there right but you don't have a deposit right the prophet of god said you've got nothing to to withdraw you'll have the atm debit card international debit card in you i'm not talking about the credit card that's right we are talking about the debit card it may be an international debit card but brother sister if you don't deposit anything you have nothing to withdraw you can go back to the message and see what brother branham says about deposits yes sir he speaks about our prayer life right right yes sir amen that's the reason we need to pray right keep on depositing keep on depositing keep on depositing right every time every time every time you know just keep on depositing put it in the heavens bank put it in the heavens bank keep on depositing and whenever you have me just go to the bank put the aid here press your phone digit number password and your money is in your head right you got 50 you you have 15 years if you're 100 they spend 100 in there you need thousands there's thousand in your head why because you got deposits all right right try it amen try it brother right amen many times we don't deposit and we keep on we want to keep on taking drugs how long you can do that my brothers my sister it's just a simple logic here right of course we are not discussing logic here but you know it's a practice of playing truth right if you don't deposit right you got nothing to withdraw exactly amen and here we stand as a fantasy self-righteous pharisee said oh god doesn't listen to me anymore i'm not going to church yeah come on brother i've done what i can we talk like that sometimes is it i don't know about you you find people but i find people in my church i'm talking about my church there oh brother sister god doesn't listen to me yeah come on that's why god said be sober be vigilant right right that's why god said to be straightforward in faith that's why god of all grace calls you right he's trying to tell you he's trying to teach us all right he's trying to let us know that he has called us to his eternal glory amen hallelujah and this suffering comes suffering suffering comes sometimes for the glory of god right sometimes it comes because of our foolishness many year time it comes because of our foolishness that's right amen amen but thank god in all these situations he knows we'll have these ups and downs he knows we will go through these things right he knows and john 17 verse 9 it says i pray for them i pray not for the world he doesn't pray he didn't pray for the worldly people but for them which god has given me for they are dying right and all mine are dying and dying are mine and i'm glorified in them praise god amen hallelujah sometimes we work in the perfect will of god sometimes we don't work in the perfect will of god we work in the permissible of god and the prophet said god will let you do that even though it is a permissive will he will let you do that but out of it the only problem is we will reap what we have sold right right but he will get all the glow right right all right but the thing is we cannot change the law of reproduction if you sow wheat you will request right if you saw rice you will be you'll reap rice what you reap the same evils what you what you saw the same view right but god will get glory amen because he will he will get you eat through that storm into that you know all the flowing waters or that fiery furnace he will get you through all those things and he will keep you safe but you will suffer and he will get glory right hallelujah amen so what is our choice today what shall we do shall we work in this perfect will i shall be working his permission well right yeah you see right in the book of genesis chapter three that was a permission realm right you see in the life of balaam permission right but all these things did hinder god didn't stop god glory you didn't change his mind no that's right it doesn't change the power of the word of god it is saying right but they had to go through the things which they went through right it's same thing with us today but somehow he will be glorified in us right amen and now i am no more in the world but these are in the world he said i come to the holy father right keep through thine own names those whom god has given me that they may be one as we are right i pray not that thou shalt just take them out of the world but that thou should escape them from the evil right amen what a prayer amen that jesus has made for us amen that our faith will not pay amer amen amen the book of luke chapter 17 verse 5 and the apostle said unto the lord increase our faith amen hallelujah the book of acts chapter 6 verse 18 it says about stephen and stephen full of faith and power did great wonders and miracles right right among the people you're right right amen hallelujah right if you want to see signs and wonders in our midst need to be full of faith and the power of the holy ghost right right then great wonders right i don't say it is not happening right no sure it is happening right but we want to see more sorry right if you want to see more of god we want to see more of god not only to see but we want to have more of god there was a prayer meeting in my visiting and they said you know one one sister came he said i have been filled with the holy ghost but i want more i said what a desire this sister has got yeah right because david says my cochlear implant yeah i believe every believer every person in this building or or everywhere in the world today the pride of jesus christ must say let my cup the power of god we are being filled and full of the power right yeah oh hallelujah you talk about jesus he said there was never was nothing that came before jesus christ the son of god but when he was but what he was more than a match for it right can you you know my words may not be clear sometimes but i will read one more time but there never was nothing that came before jesus christ the son of god but what he was more than our badge for it right amen right see the power of jesus christ the prophet of god is speaking right right there was nothing that could match or he was not a match for anything right that he had in front of him right anything that came right had to be defeated right amen and we believe he's the same jesus tonight amen he says someone says does the healing lies or they last as long as the fate lasts right but when faith fails then your healing will fail right hallelujah he says don't lose that faith our failure is because our faith fails to believe right right that's what he says our failures is because our faith doesn't believe that's right right so who wants to be playing right right way right right because i think we are more you know on the on the physical side yeah yeah if you can just take the sides of jesus just take the word of god out this is written as a as we discussed in the morning that you know the faith takes the word of god at this space well right

come down right oh you know the scriptures are blocking it glory oh hallelujah oh he came with that book open amen and he had his feet right honestly yeah why could you think he could put one kuvot on the sea and one put on the earth why did he put that because when you see in the book of revelation you know there is a beast coming out of the air there is a beast coming out of the sea and he's standing on the earth and on the sea putting those beasts under his feet and he said i have come down with the open block amen oh and come down into my people in the form of the wild amen yes sir all

he cried because his redemption wasn't that bad oh it had to be taken right it had to be taken from his hand amen right and open those shields and open that book yes sir amen and when that book was open oh brother sister we saw our names there and that's why we are hanging on right as our brother sang that song no matter what kind of storm we are going through the anchor is still holding water that makes us to stand firm right because the anchor is holding right oh just think about it oh what we need today is some real genuine faith put into action that's what we need amen what we need today is some genuine real genuine faith put into action yes sir we need real faith men who dare to put god's word to their hearts and apply it to themselves right hallelujah amen we need to have enough courage to take the word of god hallelujah and apply to our hearts and check this one this man right i am part of this world this world is speaking about me just like jesus said you destroy this temple i will raise it up how come we took so many years to build this temple yeah oh they had they had you know least of the revelation right he was talking about right he was talking about the temple the body his own body they put him to death they put him on calvary they right that's why we need to take i learned some people are business men here in this church and in every business you must willing to take the risk right right others you're not a true businessman right i've never done a business but i'm in god's business and you know i have taken risks yeah i have taken challenges right i have taken god at this world right and seen god working right on the dot right brother sister as i told you i have many testimonies i can share with you if you like to hear amen i can tell one after the other what happened what god has done in hyderabad india yes sir in that little church i can tell you how god predicted things and things happened right on the dot i can tell you how god spoke things and their lives were exposed and by the grace of god their lives were so right i can tell you so many of them right but brother sister we need to have a courage today we must have confidence in god right amen we must have confidence in the word of god and stand on the word and take up the challenge right that's what the prophet said he said what we need today is a real genuine faith right put into action right just project don't worry about anything right right amen just put the faith in action just do it and see how god was yes sir all right i give you guys right right i know he wants to die right oh the day after i arrived in usa my mother got heart attack she died for half an hour no life she was lying on the floor and people crying out to god and god brought her back after half an and she hour to go she refused to go to the hospital even to this day and she is alive in 2009 the doctor said she would be dead if you don't have bypass surgery and she took hold of the table and she stood up and she said i'm not having that surgery i'm going home she said mary the doctor said mary are you are you crazy you sit down you have to be put in the wheelchair and taken to the american channel she said i'm going home if god wants me to be alive i will live right if he wants me to go home i'm ready now she's a miracle she's alive today right all right oh brother sister my friends the lord i'm serving is a lie amen i hope i had enough words and enough understanding of english so that i could no no human understanding can express right no words of the human being is sufficient to express our god but brother i would do better if i had little more knowledge about the english i'm speaking her brother sister but you know i can do one thing i will take the word of god and apply it on my heart go to the devil hold him look into his eyes and said devil you throw challenge whatever you wanted against me and i'm ready to take your challenge right yes amen looking to his eyes that's and you become god just take the challenge if he throws anything just put a step ahead and said good double boost go down right right he'll become smaller and smaller and smaller weaker weaker and weaker and weaker now you become stronger and stronger bigger and bigger and bigger amen oh hallelujah you don't have to take any history about it it's right now right present time fact then we see it right amen amen let not our faith fail still all right oh brother sister the book of corinthians chapter 16 first current that he says we're studying watching stand fast in the faith quit you like men be strong that's what he says watch it stand fast in faith right paul to timothy he says ii timothy 4 7 i have fought a good fight i finished my course i kept my faith thank you amen you need to keep the faith there is no reason for the bride of jesus christ to lose faith right there is no reason you show me one place jesus christ was defeated you show me one place jesus christ this week you show me one place jesus christ was conquered by some new forces right you show me one place jesus christ couldn't do anything you showed me one place in the bible that jesus was weak yeah come on you show me one place if he is defeated we are defeated right amen if he lost something we will lose right but if he has victory if he has conquered all right then we are conquerors amen thank you lord hallelujah this speaks the evidences is in the people says the very faith that takes out your problems your sickness unbelief will bring it back again the same fate that takes it away unbelief can right you know bring it back right think about it and it says god is ready to fulfill his word right yes prophet said he must keep his way right he must amen right he cannot let that happen right so what else you want today take the word of god and put your faith in action right amen let us march forward as a victorious army not looking back not turning left or right right going straight putting our eyes on calvary right because we know that god must keep his way and he will keep it amen he may take 25 years like abraham yeah right amen that's not a problem he will do everything beautiful right so let us work according history right right hallelujah i want to show something about jesus in the message door of the door in 57 brother branham speaks there said when jesus was on the earth he knew that the scriptures pretend to him when he said you destroyed his body i will raise it up in three days he knew the prophet spoke about him right david spoke about him moses spoke about him and all the prophets in the old testament spoke about him and he knew the scripture was pretending to him and that's the reason he took that word and he said you destroy this temple i will raise it up in three days and he did it because he took that word which pretends to him right amen right he had faith in the word of god brother branham goes further and he says if your faith will put you in position to know that every divine promise of god's bible is for you just assure that pretend to him right every promise pretends to you right every promise is ours if we can make it personal every promise in the book is mine amen your healing your salvation your freedom from sin your selfishness from your indifferences right it says the little turtle chill you you pull yourself into christ want to come in right right he wants to be your lord a ruler set you free from all these things but we won't do it yeah but we all do it it's to fulfill the scripture that they would be lukewarm and we don't want to fulfill the word in the negative perspective yeah right we don't want to live in that lukewarm condition right right we don't want to believe in that situation right miserable right overall my life is measurable you don't have to right you can come up right right just by putting your faith in action and saying lord be my lord right if he becomes our lord yes sir not saving he's on healer amen but for many they don't want him to be the life that's right they don't want him to be their director right right or they die yeah and that's the problem he's like if we can make him our lord ruler said you'll rule my life lord and the whole thing is different right the whole thing has changed all right amen oh brother sister let's think about it let us put our faith in action let us put trust in the war in our in our daily life you know and and and let us ask god rather brown speaking about an absolute he said there are many you know what's the matter in the christian faith today we've got too many traffic jams right right yeah that's right he's speaking about traffic death now he's speaking about 1963 think about 2012 yeah september the traffic jams oh my brother right we got too many too too many yeah everybody making their own absolute when we have got one absolute and that's the word of the living god that settles it forever no matter what anyone else says it's almost gotten to a place like it was in the days of judges right said everybody has their own absolute but all it will all fail right in the last thing god's absolute is his word right right he gives it and heaven and earth will pass away but it will never pass your life yes right this word was brother branham's absolutely right this word was paul's absolute right this word i was absolute to all the disciples of jesus christ now the old testament was an absolute to the to the old testament prophets they just took the word of god and they acted upon the word of god right and what we have to do today take the word of god and act upon right right if god did there in them yeah he will do it in our lives you know i missed you amen oh this is the time they said the word and the and the bride is the church is getting united the word and the people of god are becoming one and he said god promised in the last days god promised in the last days i'm talking about the uniting time and sign in 63 paragraph 96 according to what i have on my printout and god promised in the last days that the faith of the fathers would be restored back to the bride again right that would be this this way and it couldn't be no other time but this time he promised they were so full of faith now jesus told them he said you need to wait in jerusalem until you receive the power and we know the bible says they waited for 10 days how much time can we wait right right that's a big question why right exactly we become uneasy after five minutes right if the amen is ticking brother sister if he if the if the if the needle whatever you call your hand right if the hand goes 15 minutes more yeah brother it's too much time yeah this is a long service right oh long long service long service just think about when we go to the restaurant and sit yes that's right just think about when we go to the restaurants and sit and start eating yeah especially when we go to the buffet that's right i'm including myself that's right i don't try to be judgmental i'm not your judge i'm yes amen rhymes i just think you know we are in the presence of garden and you know our preacher is going 15 minutes you know i had maybe in india we got a lazy man's game that's called cricket my sister my brother they start morning nine o'clock and the game is going on whole day up to six six thirty seven o'clock and people sitting in the stadium thousands of them yeah yeah okay now if it is a one day one day match 50 hours each side it's it's one day but if it is a test match it's five days and people going to the stadium stadium morning nine o'clock sitting up to six seven in the evening for five days entertained they get the seat they pay for the gas they pay that's right that's right come on bro just for the people who are playing in the in the in the ground yeah and you know when a man hits in a cricket when he hits a goal you know when he hits a four or six people but when you see the preaching of the word goes on rather people are attacked people hold their hand people they get frustrated people you know they get quiet people they get sauce you know yeah i don't mean you i got some more time some summer time some more hours to spend with you i don't mean you but think about it that's right think about it my brother's my friend this is life amen right oh i want to just speak about the power of god when in that first church you know when they have waited 10 days on the 50th day the power of god oh they all received the portion and brother it was such a glorious time they began to walk and their share of fear and the sick were healed oh they came and spoke the word he said gold and silver have a man but what i have i give it to you in the name of jesus christ rise up and walk and rather he rose up and he began to walk all right the prophet said god promised in the last days that the faith of the fathers would be restored back to the bride again and it would do we want in a greater measure right that is the power when this little blood of jesus christ walks on the streets of the usa right right and that shall fall right that that will rise back oh god that the sick will be healed don't you think that will happen that must happen that will happen amen if we hold fast and if our faith fail not right it will happen right thank you lord yes sir that is my prayer i'm praying for my church it's two years i said lord i want to see this right amen cancers are healed in hyderabad in the church the sheikh are healed in the name of jesus christ the demons were cast out but i want to see in a mortal in a more greater realm lord of god word of god because the prophet said it would happen right if it happened in the first chat change it will happen in the last decade it will happen it must happen and it's it's a part of us we are going to see that that's right you are involved here right you each one of you is involved in this right brother makes a statement after that somewhere he said it's not only for the pastors not only from the beacons or clusters but for the lady right right every individual right amen it's the same promise right you can have this power amen you can have this power yes sir you don't normally need the pasta i'm not putting the pasta down now you're okay you're fine but you know brother sister you must have enough fight this time yes sir maybe the pastor has gone to treat some convention in a long way and there's nobody yeah that's right that time you need to stand up right amen you must exercise your faith how long we will lay it down like this yeah how long will be broken in our lives how long will be you know weaken our faith how long we will depend on others how long we will try to say oh he's going to pray for me she's going to pray for me now i will pray i don't believe right brother i don't put my actual faith in activity oh what a day that would be amen amen and it couldn't be no other time but this time right look what a sign from heaven there's a pillar of fire hanging among us the signs and wonders of the lord jesus christ widely speaks cuisine never fails to be perfectly on the docks hallelujah when a man lives by freight and walks by faith i mean substance faith he said that's it he said he's isolated from the entire world and become a new creature in christ right then you are getting into a bright material he says right you are getting into a rapturing condition that means for each one of us exactly each one of us right every one of us man not just the pastor deacon justice right that means for the laity every individual walks in a world with god alone you are baptized into his kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and god he gives the others and you pack them out right whatever he says there's not a shadow of doubt nobody you walk right on if the lord says this that nobody in the world can talk you out of it you go on right right on just the same right you are coming into a perfect faith perfect perfection that cannot take right yes sir perfect perfection amen all right that faith never fails right right i think you're glad damn it glory because it's not our faith it's a faith of god all right hallelujah amen it's a divine faith in the bride of jesus christ can you imagine program telling that story when the chinese came into usa and

in different shapes and farts and they gave one part to the to the the customer and they kept one right and when that when the customer came with that portion that that you know cut that portion and he takes his portion and when the two things matches right that's it he gives the clothes to that right can you can you see that part is here on the underwear all right all right he will come brother when he comes the down the thing which is down the path has to come and meet together right and when it is matches he will take her home what a glorious time yes he was a mystic to them with his
