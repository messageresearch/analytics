[0:01] alright so what we're going to do is
[0:03] today we're going to just kind of start
[0:06] in a section this is this is that one
[0:10] week that we're starting to talk about
[0:13] okay yeah yes yeah we need to talk about
[0:18] something about that um oh yeah I look
[0:22] just think about me what I got to give
[0:25] out of this quick yeah yeah I got it
[0:28] right right okay all right we're having
[0:32] to do without the multi task today but
[0:35] this is this this is the part of the
[0:38] chart that we have we've already got
[0:41] finished with everybody understand i
[0:43] hope about the pic no 483 years if we've
[0:49] already covered the sharp member the
[0:52] charges was up there this much right
[0:54] here we're pretty clear on that that
[0:59] this 483 years has already been
[1:01] completed not 486 and a half most people
[1:06] in the message this this gets
[1:09] wrong have four hundred eighty six and a
[1:13] half when they say there's only three
[1:14] and a half years left after the rapture
[1:16] of time to finish I'm telling you this
[1:19] because it's it's in the way you say it
[1:22] there is only three and a half years
[1:24] left of Jesus's ministry to the Jews no
[1:27] doubt there's only three and a half
[1:29] years of tribulation we're going to
[1:31] reject the trouble all right but there's
[1:34] one week or seven years left because
[1:38] we've only covered 483 years right there
[1:45] we've only covered 483 years to the
[1:47] cutting off of them aside Daniel 9 24 25
[1:54] going fourth commandment to restore and
[1:56] build Jerusalem until the Messiah prams
[1:58] to be seven weeks priest born two weeks
[2:00] we covered that all right here everybody
[2:02] got that there's no doubt that there's
[2:05] 483 years finished not 486 and I don't
[2:09] even sound good
[2:10] right right it's 483 years finished but
[2:15] how many years are promised 490 so
[2:20] obviously 480 three or four hundred nine
[2:23] months 483 is what seven years left damn
[2:32] one week equals what seven years all
[2:36] right so there's one week left to the
[2:39] Jude the 70th week if you'll even look
[2:43] in your Daniel 70 weeks book brother
[2:46] branham preaches the last sermon he
[2:49] preaches is on the 70th week okay all
[2:56] right
[3:06] all right we'll be took me that's okay
[3:11] I'm gonna refrain from from reading
[3:19] anything out of the boat for right now
[3:20] all right so now if you want to write
[3:23] this down that's okay but you can write
[3:25] it as we talked about so now if this is
[3:29] the seventh church age which we living
[3:32] in right you and I are right now right
[3:36] about there okay you and I are right
[3:43] about right that what wait a minute hold

[3:59] here oh you are here right there right
[4:07] and being at that point now anything
[4:12] that happens between here to there has
[4:14] nothing to do with you and I got dealt
[4:18] with the Jews stopped and began dealing
[4:21] with the Gentiles 27 church ages mmm all
[4:25] right then when he finishes rapture of
[4:27] church aids bride to me that covers you
[4:31] can't just say wraps of the bride
[4:33] rapture of the church age bride you can
[4:36] say Gentiles if you want to but it
[4:38] covers Gentile in any nation like and
[4:41] then God does what he turns back to the
[4:45] Jews according to the angle 926 and
[4:51] after three score 2 we shall Messiah be
[4:53] cut off and on for his help people the
[4:55] prince that shall come shall destroy the
[4:56] city we know that was Titus and
[4:58] therefore shall be with a flood and at
[5:00] the end of the war desolations
[5:01] clairement and he shall confirm the
[5:04] covenant with many for one week what's
[5:06] going to happen when we go home this
[5:10] will be God incarnate going interactor
[5:15] if you're going to get a body change
[5:17] this glorified body it's going to be God
[5:19] incarnate in you so what Satan gonna do
[5:24] he's gonna come right back big on comin
[5:27] behind not right back down heaters down
[5:28] here anyway he's got your step right
[5:30] over here and do the same thing but he's
[5:32] gonna be Satan incarnate in a man called
[5:36] hope hey that's the he he shall confirm
[5:39] the code many for how long how long and
[5:45] one weight equals okay we all right with
[5:50] that yes and in the midst of the week
[5:53] watch the middle of seven right so you
[6:02] got you got three and a half years here
[6:04] uh-huh can you got three and a half
[6:06] years here or 1260 days and twelve
[6:11] hundred and sixty days that all right
[6:15] there all right yeah 1260 and 1260 get
[6:21] it cuz it's gonna be in Florida folks
[6:23] that's why this is a 16-6 yes please
[6:28] yeah well you got 1260 days and to
[6:31] prophets are going to prop it up okay
[6:33] cut off in the middle of the week and
[6:36] you've got more time left if one week
[6:38] equal seven years prophetically remember
[6:42] seven years is seven x 360 ok and then
[6:48] let's see what to do I had it at home
[6:50] but I didn't what I'm gonna go this way
[6:51] but let's do they were 16 I'm a couple
[6:59] milady good let's go to be important
[7:02] what you got that's what I thought all
[7:06] right you're gonna have
[7:08] I'm at twenty-five hundred and twenty
[7:12] days prophetic calendar so there's 2525
[7:17] 2520 days left according to the
[7:22] prophetic calendar all right that's 25
[7:25] that's going to be really important
[7:27] right that's going to be really
[7:29] important because when we get to this
[7:31] number 20 26 this is the year twenty
[7:35] twenty six eighty remember I told you to
[7:38] put that on there to remember it to keep
[7:39] it in because we got to go back and once
[7:43] we go back we might be able to tell more
[7:46] about you are here okay all right don't
[7:55] you remember too though this is the key
[7:58] remember time continues this the 70th
[8:03] week of Daniel ends the prophecy and
[8:09] begins the Millennium which is still one
[8:12] thousand years of daylight dark 360 days
[8:17] kind of okay so it's not gonna be a
[8:21] thousand years of 365 and forth anymore
[8:24] what's going to happen the way I see it
[8:26] if brother Brown said some kind of
[8:28] atomic explosion tilted the world off in
[8:31] the days of Noah to make it 365 and for
[8:34] God right here when this a comic battle
[8:37] starts of all of Armageddon go this is
[8:40] an atomic battle this is actually men
[8:42] fighting men bombs gases chemicals
[8:46] whatever they can throw at each other
[8:47] they don't throw it but that thing is
[8:50] going to do what it's going to be an
[8:51] atomic explosion in the world don't sit
[8:53] right leg up just got to come back in
[8:56] order for right hand money everybody got
[9:00] there but now that you know it's hot so
[9:03] you could say seven years plus the
[9:07] millennium is still time right yes
[9:09] that's correct why's it it's a raptor
[9:11] took place right now you would have a
[9:12] thousand and seven years with right of
[9:14] before the white throne
[9:16] right okay yeah cuz I ready just a few
[9:20] minutes ago revelation 20 said the dead
[9:22] NAS Liam for a thousand years go see it
[9:24] right here at this battle of Armageddon
[9:27] there's not going to be any believers on
[9:29] the earth that's kind of hard to believe
[9:30] but you're talking you're foolish
[9:33] virgins going to be killed during this
[9:35] time your two prophets in 144,000 go to
[9:38] be killed at this battle of Armageddon
[9:40] is nothing but even against heathen
[9:44] leave me hope that's what's been forever
[9:47] there is no one there is no one with the
[9:51] Holy Ghost right here that's why they
[9:55] gonna start throwing things at each
[9:56] other they ain't care you already know
[10:00] one thing's for sure Israel has the
[10:04] Samson of thing Samson remember when he
[10:09] pushed those pillars he said Lord I'm
[10:11] gonna die but take all these with me
[10:13] will they have the Israel when all this
[10:15] happened you know what's going to happen
[10:16] here's what going to say push the button
[10:20] take a lot if we're going down if you're
[10:22] going to be this we're going all beat
[10:24] each other that's the Samson effects
[10:26] they already have that in place so
[10:29] anyway so this battle Armageddon once
[10:32] that battle begins and ends it will be
[10:34] nobody going to heaven right so it says
[10:38] in the Bible revelations 20 the dead not
[10:40] live for a thousand years so whoever
[10:44] dies right here is going to stay dead
[10:46] for a thousand years till we come up to
[10:49] the walk on judgment that some of them
[10:50] could be given eat our life right that's
[10:52] why I said there's 90 x filled with the
[10:54] Holy Ghost round here I'm not saying
[10:56] that people won't be given eternal life
[10:57] but somebody may be given eternal life
[10:59] surely the foolish virgin they're going
[11:02] to die and stay in the ground you know
[11:06] why the food's Burton has to die because
[11:09] they don't get cleanse here you and I
[11:12] see you and that's what really they are
[11:13] trying to freeze now the Holy Ghost if
[11:16] the Holy Ghost is the only thing goes
[11:18] interactor but a foolish version can be
[11:21] justified and sanctified and not here
[11:23] all the right word the unclean spirit
[11:27] can come back like a religious but still
[11:29] to a point they're virgins just this
[11:32] foolish virgin okay flannel that's why
[11:36] I'm going to tell you right now that's
[11:38] the way I believe it a lot of people
[11:39] that send this message you're going to
[11:41] be food for a lot like like eighty
[11:45] percent why go there not been taught
[11:51] just against that came back to hold up
[11:53] they just did leave a message they've
[11:56] been taught wrong I just told you have
[12:00] and I said yeah plays one thing for sure
[12:06] when that Devil confronted brother
[12:09] branham he was a spiritual being he knew
[12:11] that meant something was right about
[12:13] that man so guess what he's a believer
[12:15] him but how does these people that teach
[12:18] others wrong that is just trying to hype
[12:21] you what do they do about the time for
[12:23] the millennium that's still tired yeah I
[12:27] they just don't they got quotes so you
[12:31] just got them we're going to read them
[12:32] where it sounds contrary to everything
[12:35] we're talking about but there's no way
[12:37] that's why I'm telling you we're going
[12:38] to line it up by the Bible then we're
[12:41] going to start reading quote you can see
[12:44] what we're doing i'm not quoting brother
[12:45] around many many times we went just by
[12:48] the mile sure I've interjected things
[12:49] that brother brown fat and obviously but
[12:51] we'd not really just put them on the
[12:53] screen and said look this is what he
[12:54] said right okay because in the book
[12:57] seven times he said there's one week
[12:59] left after the rapture then you get in
[13:01] the seals he said no I didn't say that
[13:02] well if he said it the way that they
[13:10] thought he said it he's like you were
[13:13] they yeah they thought he said it but
[13:15] the way he said and the way he's over
[13:18] here in the bank in the seals he's
[13:21] saying the same thing ok that's long as
[13:26] you get in your head there is only
[13:27] twelve hundred and sixty days left after
[13:30] the rapture of the Ministry of Jesus
[13:32] Christ brood to profits that's all cloud
[13:37] he preached grant half already over here
[13:40] all right slow down verse 27 food we're
[13:44] gonna do scripture today and he shall
[13:45] confirm the covenant with many for one
[13:47] week we're right here oh my god there he
[13:51] shall confirm when we go up there is no
[13:55] Gentile saved after that God comes
[13:58] directly into these two prophets and
[14:00] starts calling out 144,000 do I need to
[14:04] round 11 44,000 Yolanda left the two
[14:07] prophets preached and bring 144,000 out
[14:10] well Satan is standing right here
[14:11] incarnate in a pope and he's going to
[14:15] make a covenant for seven years and he
[14:18] shall confirm the covenant with many for
[14:20] one week remember he's not going to just
[14:23] make the covenant with Israel he's going
[14:25] to make two coming it with the whole
[14:26] world cuz walking out look now
[14:27] everybody's against Israel even us now
[14:30] everybody's against Israel folks going
[14:33] to walk in and say hey except now you
[14:36] know actually buy this time America is
[14:37] going to be pretty it in pretty bad
[14:38] shape earthquakes already going to
[14:40] happen in California we're going to be
[14:41] our economy is going to be cloud filled
[14:44] folks don't step in say okay hold on
[14:47] let's let's make a peace treaty here
[14:50] let's make a covenant with many for one
[14:55] for seven years let's make a seven-year
[14:57] covenant let's go bother each other
[14:59] let's let Israel do what everyone's
[15:01] doing let's let America rebuild let's
[15:03] let Russia do this all of us come
[15:06] together and we're going to survive this
[15:08] thing come in with flattery he's coming
[15:12] in to unite right he's coming into like
[15:18] a brand together right alright so that's
[15:22] what's going to happen and in the midst
[15:24] of the week which is right here all
[15:28] right after the Prophet 1260 days he's
[15:32] going to break it all right now what
[15:38] we're going to do is we're going to go
[15:39] back and it's going to give a little
[15:42] confusing but I pray that you that
[15:44] you'll follow me because these feast
[15:48] days still have a lot to do with this
[15:49] one week actually to me that's what the
[15:52] feast
[15:53] for the culmination of the feast days
[15:55] happens in this one week your seven

[16:04] their Pentecost and then and then
[16:08] they're going to receive the Day of
[16:09] Atonement the trumpet through two
[16:12] prophets these are the trumpets right
[16:16] then you come down to the feast of a
[16:18] coat you got a day of atonement what
[16:19] brother Brown said it won't be that
[16:21] they'll kill him again it's a morning
[16:24] for the kill they'll go back in Jeremiah
[16:26] and read where did you get those scars
[16:28] right in the house of my friend through
[16:32] these two problems they're gonna see
[16:33] Jesus Christ and they're going to go in
[16:35] morning so man we killed him 2,000
[16:38] something years ago we're in trouble and
[16:40] then really he comes in since we don't
[16:42] worry about cuz we won't read your mind
[16:43] I've ever read by Jacob trouble we're
[16:46] going through today alright we're going
[16:48] to read that we don't worry anything
[16:49] else but he shall confirm the covenant
[16:52] for one week and in the midst of the
[16:53] week he shall cause the sacrifice and
[16:56] the oblation to cease he's going to walk
[16:58] in and say I am your atonement and he's
[17:07] going to kill this big profit he's going
[17:10] to come in to look you got Passover is
[17:15] when they killed the lamb right are we
[17:18] going to watch this Passover's when they
[17:20] kill the lamb right now what they're
[17:23] going to get here is they're going to
[17:25] give this to feast all these feasts
[17:27] they're coming together just like you
[17:31] not get them because remember we get
[17:32] them spiritually we don't get them
[17:33] naturally we get on spiritually right
[17:35] okay Jesus died for our sins 11 Brad
[17:39] firstfruits where the firstfruits come
[17:41] up Pentecost we receive the Holy Ghost
[17:44] brother Brown said we're now we are now
[17:47] in face of the trumpet easy we're now
[17:49] under the feast of tabernacle you and I
[17:51] spiritually why God timer tackling in

[18:32] prophets are going to be killed you look
[18:34] at revelations 12 14 they're going to be
[18:37] killed 144,000 will be killed and
[18:39] they're going to go in there after
[18:39] they're going to have to wait a little
[18:41] while from this valve Armageddon go and
[18:42] come back cuz I got something to do
[18:44] right here I left that blank let's get
[18:46] the first part right you are here we go
[18:49] in our actress Satan comes down
[18:50] incarnate suppose he little age she'll
[18:53] make a covenant for one year then he's
[18:55] going to break that covenant all right
[18:57] and for overspreading of abominations he
[18:59] shall make it desolate white he walks
[19:01] into that temple because they're going
[19:03] to lift a home the old you I mean the
[19:05] new Jews were going to build a temple
[19:06] it's what you want to do now they know
[19:10] thing build a temple they need to red
[19:11] heifer they need the sacrifices they
[19:14] need the altar and guess his God Romans
[19:17] got all the member he's looked at Tates
[19:19] we saw the we saw the mural that was it
[19:22] was engraved in stone showed him coming
[19:24] back with a menorah and the ark and I
[19:26] and Israel knows they got it they not
[19:30] done and they need those pieces so what
[19:36] better time for a man called a poet step
[19:38] being the same alright we're going to
[19:40] make this covenant but you got to be
[19:42] peaceful we're gonna give you a heart
[19:44] back we're going to give you mine or
[19:46] back we're going to give you this back
[19:49] so see they're getting ready see a tie
[19:53] this is a real type of town because the
[19:56] bag is in the Methodist and all they
[19:58] know jesus is coming but they don't know
[20:01] how they don't think got the word to do
[20:03] it with same way with the common jus
[20:08] but there's a two prophets in 144,000 is
[20:11] going come in and say look just like
[20:14] Jesus he walked in the temple and said I
[20:15] am the bread of life unleavened bread
[20:19] they were having the feast of my liver
[20:20] bread he walks in the temple to the I'm
[20:22] to bread of life no they got mad at
[20:25] right same thing home didn't listen this
[20:29] 144,000 extra profits are not going to
[20:32] be killed by just some American think

[20:39] to be any point who's going to kill them
[20:41] their own people don't people ones that
[20:46] want liberal temple worship right

[20:54] glad we went over them because if it's
[20:56] interlaced all in here so according to

[22:44] this one come over the best one no oh no
[22:48] I might be but I don't anymore because
[22:51] cuz look you can't do that in show it to
[22:55] a bunch of people because they'll say
[22:56] well the angel on the wall do it like
[22:59] brother I'm doing which is fine that's
[23:00] okay you know single but read one run
[23:05] around to that taste of one hates left
[23:07] over the other so the lamp over an age
[23:09] would be like that no one ate leftover
[23:14] the other right okay I mean to me that's
[23:17] just common sense right okay that's why
[23:21] 1977 so important 1977 to me was the
[23:24] finish of the lap over of that church
[23:27] age that old Pentecostal age come and in
[23:30] 1977 we come into the Son of Man
[23:32] ministry and it went higher than they'd
[23:34] ever been before okay we talked about
[23:38] that the question was a lap oh oh oh he
[23:44] said it was the end of this from the
[23:46] sick the lap over the six over to the
[23:48] seventh we should say no no no the lap
[23:51] over from the states church age to the
[23:52] senator kay was during the Pentecostal
[23:55] time okay that's for those because
[23:57] little girl Wesley Wesley Wesley was
[24:00] fine for his day and then there was a
[24:02] lot of west lens that came over they
[24:05] just remember when it brother i'm saying
[24:06] to start 1906 huh so right in here they
[24:09] would feel a little bit of Wesley going
[24:11] on but 1912 look 19 6 is one of the Holy
[24:15] Ghost felt in the age starting brother
[24:17] I'm saying but remember 1912 is when the
[24:21] oneness when they came out one drilling
[24:23] with God and Jesus Christ water baptism
[24:25] because remember 1906
[24:27] trashed Arians they were baptized the
[24:28] father son Holy Ghost they believed in
[24:30] 30 Trinity but the Holy Ghost fell on
[24:33] them to give them the gifts okay but
[24:38] then it brother Brown said y'all would
[24:40] have been all right if you'd have moved
[24:41] on but they cabbage down on you guys
[24:45] speaking tongue is the evidence so
[24:48] brother Brown said what God moved right
[24:50] from the Pentecost right over to the
[24:51] badness bambridge took you so far and
[24:53] got left the batter's went right over
[24:54] into the different ones okay alright so
[24:57] now truly we're in a bride age let's go
[25:01] to Jeremiah though this is very
[25:04] interesting because what happened is
[25:06] this is a time this is always called the
[25:09] time of Jacob's trouble you ask the
[25:12] Israel they know it's come and watch the
[25:13] word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord
[25:15] said now remember Jeremiah's the one got
[25:19] told that they're being captivity for 17
[25:24] weeks remember way by long time ago
[25:26] around airline because what did Daniel
[25:28] do Daniel read my books he looked back
[25:31] to Jeremiah and Caroline I said you
[25:33] gonna be in there remember Jeremiah
[25:35] comes up and and Hananiah there's no are
[25:39] we going out in two years and puts the
[25:41] horn on and you know knock something
[25:42] down and makes a big show Jeremiah said
[25:45] that's fine but the guy only lived six
[25:48] months he's died remember God took the
[25:51] man off the same not Jeremiah but the
[25:53] other prophet why cuz you didn't get his
[25:55] daniel said two weeks right good the
[25:59] word that came to generalize from the
[26:00] Lord saying thus speaketh the Lord got a
[26:02] visual saying right knee all the words
[26:04] that I've spoken unto thee in a book for
[26:08] lo the days come days days saith the
[26:12] lord that i will bring again the
[26:14] captivity of my people Israel and Judah
[26:16] said the Lord and i will cause them to
[26:19] return to the land 1947 remember they
[26:23] were scattered watch what he's going to
[26:24] do with the people of scattered and I
[26:26] will cause them to return to the land
[26:28] that I give to their fathers and they
[26:30] shall possess it that's a prophecy this
[26:33] we saw fulfill all right and these are
[26:38] the words that the Lord spake concerning
[26:40] Israel and concern
[26:41] Judah because remember Judah was one
[26:43] that went whoring you know what Babu
[26:46] come for the SAT the Lord we have heard
[26:50] a voice of trembling of fear and not of
[26:53] peace and had peace in Brevard ASCII now
[26:59] and see whether a man does prevail with
[27:02] child wherefore do I see every man with
[27:05] his hand on his loins and a woman in
[27:07] travail and all phases are turned into
[27:10] paleness alas for that day or now what
[27:13] he'd be talking about he's talking about
[27:17] when these two prophets start preaching
[27:19] the revelation of Jesus Christ these
[27:22] people are going to start absolutely
[27:24] travailing and mourning and weeping
[27:26] again when they get a revelation as one
[27:30] infant prevailed in all phases returning
[27:32] to penisy that's going to question alas
[27:33] for that day is great so that none is
[27:36] like it it is even the time of Jacob's
[27:39] trouble but he shall be saved out of it
[27:42] 144,000 not all Jews 144,000 for it
[27:48] shall come to pass in that day saith the
[27:50] Lord of hosts then I will break his yoke
[27:52] from all the neck and will burst I bond
[27:55] give them holy go and strangers shall no
[27:59] more serve themselves of him the
[28:03] strangers over there us-russia right
[28:07] because what's which might be but they
[28:10] shall serve the lord their god and david
[28:13] their king now David is no I son of
[28:24] David whom I will raise up unto them
[28:28] okay they did raise up a natural David
[28:31] but he promised that natural David that
[28:33] he would rule and reign so what's the
[28:36] time of Jacob's trouble is coming on
[28:38] over here a little bit lamp over just a
[28:41] little okay because remember the King
[28:43] he's the son of David here but he can't
[28:46] be a son of David here until he comes
[28:48] here and does all this we're fixing talk
[28:50] about put everything a line
[28:52] therefore fear thou not o my servant
[28:56] Jacob that the Lord neither be dismayed
[28:58] o Israel for low I will save thee from
[29:02] afar and thy seed from the land of their
[29:05] captivity and Jacob shall return and
[29:08] shall be in rest and be quiet and none
[29:11] shall make him afraid alright Brian
[29:14] Wendy said the Lord I see he's come out
[29:16] of Jacob trouble he's really had no rent
[29:18] to the millennium cuz remember the
[29:20] Millennium is a jubilee for the Jews
[29:23] rest remember when you had a jubilee in
[29:26] the Bible you had a rest your arrest
[29:28] rest time right remember that but now
[29:34] they gotta come up yeah yeah we got
[29:38] we've gotta work on that inside here I'm
[29:41] just giving you a whole part of Jacob's
[29:43] trouble really how to put parentheses
[29:44] and put it in here but really it's
[29:46] covering all the way the limit but watch
[29:47] for unwitnessed at the Lord to save thee
[29:50] though I make a full end of all nations
[29:53] whether I have scattered thee road

[34:43] multitude of thine iniquity watch
[34:47] because I sins were increase but what's
[34:50] he going to do first part of the six
[34:53] fold purpose finish transgression make
[34:54] the end of their sins and reconciliation
[34:56] for their iniquity that's going to be
[34:58] fulfilled okay then I got that look the
[35:02] word iniquity there's an equity in all
[35:04] these different things right why Christ
[35:07] now for that affliction the sorrow is
[35:09] incurable for the multitude of that
[35:11] iniquity now looks like they're in
[35:13] trouble the watch because thy sins were
[35:18] in crieff
[35:20] hmm I have done these things under there
[35:23] he's telling them if you would or not
[35:25] sin you wouldn't be in the place you're
[35:27] in there for all day that devour these
[35:33] shall be devoured he's fixing to turn
[35:36] this thing all back around all that
[35:39] adversaries every one of them shall go
[35:42] into captivity be killed and they they
[35:46] spoil this shall be a spoil and all that
[35:49] prey upon thee will I give for a prey
[35:51] remember God said long time ago he said
[35:53] whoever honours Israel I wonder that
[35:55] nation that's why God Brown see God
[35:57] honored United States because they've
[35:58] honored Israel but what when everybody
[36:01] turns against Israel we're done anybody
[36:05] turns fire give me for a prayer for I
[36:08] will restore health unto thee and I will
[36:13] heal the of thy womb say at the Lord
[36:17] because they call the an outcast saying
[36:20] this design whom no man seeketh after
[36:23] thus says the Lord behold I will look of
[36:26] eyes I will bring again the captivity of
[36:30] Jacob tents and have mercy on his
[36:32] dwelling places and the City shall be
[36:35] builded upon her own heap and the palace
[36:39] shall remain after the manner there and
[36:43] you can read the rest of it we don't
[36:44] have time and out of them shall proceed
[36:46] Thanksgiving divorce of them to make
[36:48] merry i will multiply them they shall
[36:49] not be a few i will also glorify them
[36:52] and they shall not be small not that
[36:55] it's Jacob's trouble that's the time of
[37:00] Jacob's trouble but what is happening
[37:01] God is bringing them out of that trouble
[37:03] because see there's going to be a
[37:06] tabernacle read Ezekiel 42 44 that's the
[37:11] Millennial temple that the Jews will
[37:13] erect sometime in here because remember
[37:19] right here it's going to be the
[37:22] fulfillment of revelations 19
[37:30] what happens in Revelation right come
[37:32] back right with their rights 19 1 and
[37:37] after these things I heard a great voice
[37:38] and less people in heaven saying I lelu
[37:40] your salvation and glory and power and
[37:41] honor to the Lord you keep going to
[37:44] bride somewhat the bride and the armies
[37:49] that were in heaven followed him upon
[37:50] white horses clothed in fine linen white
[37:52] and clean who's that brother Brian said
[37:54] that is thus riding back into the
[37:56] millennium and according to this last /
[38:01] full six full purpose is what a north of
[38:03] most holy sometime right in here but
[38:07] we'll get to that but we don't lay them
[38:08] feast days right into that hmm Z 0 40 40
[38:15] through chapter 44 it is the lot of
[38:18] people think that spiritual but i might
[38:20] brother branham I don't see why God
[38:22] would take so much time to put all the
[38:23] dimension then if it's just spiritual
[38:25] run there's dimensions they're going to
[38:27] actually build a temple because we
[38:29] that's what's the Millennium is God's
[38:32] not going to do away with sure what i'm
[38:35] doing sacrifices but God want to say God
[38:37] is going to let them erect that temple
[38:38] and then we're going to be able to teach
[38:40] in that temple because we're the ones
[38:41] going to be able to live in the temple
[38:43] and then the 12 tribes of Israel that's
[38:47] what the son of David was promised that
[38:49] you'll rule in the millennium or your
[38:50] rule over the 12 tribes of Israel has a
[38:52] son of David so it's going to be the son
[38:54] of David sitting on the throne okay and
[38:58] all this bride around him and then the
[39:03] hundred forty-four thousand is going to
[39:04] be the servants and the 50 mg alright
[39:07] will be raised up in the Millennium I
[39:09] don't understand as a pop so the Jews
[39:12] resurrect and build all the temples
[39:16] overrun in here somewhere in this that's
[39:18] why there's 1260 days left but then we
[39:21] don't come back to thank get all that
[39:23] done that's correct yes that's correct
[39:25] yeah the bride comes back to live in the
[39:28] table that's why I'm bad
[39:31] directed to deal that's right that's why
[39:33] I that I need something maybe that's no
[39:36] looker that's why listen if Daniel 70
[39:43] weeks stops right here you've done away
[39:47] with all that yeah you know time to come
[39:52] got it out of it you've done away
[39:54] without that whole picture right here
[39:55] you don't have 1220 day you've only got
[39:58] that that's what people the message say
[39:59] no there's only three and a half years
[40:01] left and that ends they say this ends
[40:04] the seventy weeks of Daniel no way that
[40:07] can happen because remember we got a
[40:10] sixfold / + 3 of them here and three of
[40:13] them here okay bring in everlasting
[40:16] righteousness you can't do that before
[40:17] the Battle of Armageddon how you gonna
[40:20] bring their relax and righteous just
[40:21] need to destroy everything I mean it
[40:26] just don't really make sense but you
[40:27] know what to do they hone in on a couple
[40:29] of clothes and then they build all this
[40:32] around just a couple of cool Jesus
[40:35] didn't eat my flesh and drink my blood
[40:37] they probably a lot of people built
[40:38] around up around those clothes that were
[40:41] nuts so let's go they will get back into
[40:45] next week come on through this plant
[40:48] you
