[0:00] not showing
[0:06] him you got start back all over all over
[0:09] I'm
[0:10] sorry I'm already 15 minutes
[0:13] in no it just did yeah it hadn't go
[0:17] ahead now um so Reuben represents he's
[0:22] he's the man if you remember the four
[0:23] Beast the position of them around the AR
[0:25] Reuben's on the bottom a good kind of
[0:28] trick to remember the positions the
[0:30] Eagles up top right North and the uh
[0:33] Lion on the East and the lion starts
[0:35] goes around like this lion o man eag
[0:41] right um so Reuben um what Reuben the
[0:46] one that tried to save his
[0:48] brother he the one yeah he tried Toph
[0:52] that shows first born and that little
[0:56] more knowledge the rest of well he
[1:04] that come from my
[1:07] mother yeah I agree with
[1:11] that hey
[1:14] man uh and I have a quote about what
[1:17] brother Brandon said about first one it
[1:18] don't matter we got quote
[1:24] there no he said in Revelation 4 1961 he
[1:28] said now Reuben was the man he was the
[1:30] first one y the weakest one of the bunch
[1:33] yep didn't Jacob say so in Genesis 49
[1:36] Ruben Thou Art the first of my strength
[1:38] now think about this in context of of
[1:40] the just man's strength there no there's
[1:43] no strength in us we have to take our
[1:45] strength from God Ruben thou are the
[1:47] first of my strength but like water you
[1:49] went up on my couch and defile my couch
[1:50] and live with his father's concubine see
[1:52] that's the immorals of the human being
[1:54] you see the animal don't have the
[1:55] memorials the lion none of these things
[1:57] has that but the man does ruin the next
[1:58] man's wife and so forth just like the
[2:00] same the same thing everything's
[2:03] completed now this down here this Dan
[2:05] was an equal and this Reuben was the
[2:07] man's face so then we get to Simeon and
[2:09] Levi Simeon and Levi are Brethren
[2:11] instruments of Cruelty are in their
[2:13] habitations oh my soul come not thou
[2:15] into their secret under their assembly
[2:16] my honor be not be th not thou United
[2:19] for in their anger they slew a man and
[2:21] in their self will they dig down a wall
[2:24] now he's talking about the story in
[2:25] Genesis 34 um each of the each of these
[2:29] prophecies has uh many different
[2:32] directions you can go you can so part of
[2:34] this is um uh story of Simon and Levi
[2:37] how they slew hamor and shik after they
[2:39] circumcised him because they uh one of
[2:42] them U had had a crush on Dina and
[2:47] uh I'm not going to read all that and
[2:49] then uh so so he prophesied that they
[2:51] were going to be part of the part of his
[2:53] prophecy was they were going to be
[2:54] divided and Scattered in Israel and this
[2:56] is speaking of um in Joshua 19 Simon's
[3:00] inheritance was actually part and pieces
[3:02] of judah's inheritance he got just part
[3:05] scattered around and Levi receiv
[3:07] received because uh they they received
[3:09] the priesthood not any particular
[3:11] territory they uh levied 48 cities
[3:14] scattered throughout the other tribes
[3:16] and this is I believe this is also
[3:19] speaking of um Israel's rejection of
[3:22] Christ uh ended up they scattered around
[3:25] the world and it resulted in the 10 lost
[3:28] tribes of Israel um Judah Thou Art he
[3:31] whom thy Brethren shall praise thy hand
[3:33] shall be in the neck of thine enemies
[3:34] thy father's children shall bow down
[3:36] before thee Judah is a lion's
[3:39] will from the Jud is a lion's will from
[3:42] the pray my son thou are gone up he
[3:44] stoop down he couched as a lion and as
[3:46] an old lion who shall Rous him up now
[3:48] this is there's a there's a speaking of
[3:51] the qualities of Christ and speaking of
[3:53] the quality of Judah as well so
[4:00] this is speaking of Christ's death he
[4:03] washed in Isaiah he washed in garments
[4:05] and wine his clothes in the blood of
[4:07] grapes the cross and
[4:12] um in Isaiah 63 he said who is this that
[4:14] Cometh From Edom with Dy garments from
[4:18] bosra wherefore art thou read and thine
[4:21] of heral thy garments like him that
[4:22] treadeth in wine fat and uh
[4:27] so so judah's prophec see pictures our
[4:30] Lord's kingship because Judah got the
[4:32] scepter so the scepter the Messiah is
[4:34] going to come from Judah and then
[4:39] uh let's see
[4:41] next zebulun verse 13 zebulun shall
[4:46] dwell at the Haven of the sea and he
[4:47] shall be for a Haven of ships and his
[4:49] borders shall be
[4:50] inion
[4:52] zidon Zulan is interesting because
[4:57] um first of all because he's not next in
[5:00] the lineage of all if you look at the
[5:02] genealogy zebulin is the 10th and uh
[5:05] Judah is the fourth so Jacob jumps in
[5:08] his Blessing from the fourth child to
[5:10] the 10th child so Christ was actually
[5:12] born part of Judah but zebulun is where
[5:15] he
[5:16] lived cuz zeul in
[5:20] uh I think this is Moses prophecy I
[5:23] didn't write the book down zebulin shall
[5:25] dwell at the Haven of the sea and he
[5:26] shall be for a Haven of ships and his
[5:29] bord shall be unto
[5:31] zidon that's uh where Galilee part of
[5:34] Galilee was in
[5:37] Zebulon and Moses prophesied of zebulun
[5:39] and of zebulin he said rejoice zebulin
[5:42] in thy going out and isar and thy tent
[5:44] they shall call the people into the
[5:45] mountains so there they shall offer
[5:46] sacrifices of righteousness for they
[5:48] shall suck of the abundance of the Seas
[5:50] and of treasures hid in the
[5:54] sayand so
[5:57] zebulin Judah is his kingship kind of
[6:01] picture Zebula as uh Christ is our Haven
[6:05] our refuge and our Haven of Rest because
[6:07] it was where God uh when he was on Earth
[6:11] U let's
[6:12] see he would he would kind of zeel was
[6:15] kind of treated as his resting place it
[6:18] was where uh zebulin Galilee was where
[6:21] Mary and Joseph returned from Egypt and
[6:24] um
[6:33] when John had heard that when Jesus
[6:35] heard that John was cast into prison he
[6:37] departed into
[6:40] Galilee now let's move on to
[6:43] isachar moving a little bit fast isar is
[6:46] a strong ass couching down between two
[6:49] burdens and he saw that rest was good
[6:52] and the land that it was pleasant and
[6:53] bowed his shoulder to bear and became a
[6:55] servant unto tribute so this is kind of
[6:57] presenting c isachar as a servant and as
[6:59] a
[7:05] servant and it's car this is interesting
[7:08] his car and was I was reading on this um
[7:12] Hebrew website that just kind of listed
[7:15] out some views of different rabbis and
[7:17] things this car has traditionally been
[7:18] taugh of thought of as a out of is car
[7:21] came all the religious teachers and they
[7:23] kind of had a symbiotic relationship
[7:25] with zebulun so zebulun was a bunch of
[7:27] merchants and they would make all the
[7:29] money money so that his car could study
[7:33] and they even today they uh when you
[7:35] ever hear the phrase is car in zeul you
[7:36] kind of it means that that kind of
[7:38] relationship where one provides the
[7:40] income and the other provide does the
[7:42] study got kind of relationship like that
[7:45] um so is AAR the servant u in numbers 26
[7:49] only Judah and Dan had more men and Dan
[7:53] only had 100
[7:55] more and
[7:57] uh and uh 1 Chronicles 1232 it even
[8:00] speaks of thear being U men of
[8:03] understanding it says of the children of
[8:05] isar which were men that had
[8:07] understanding of the times to know what
[8:08] Israel ought to do the heads of them
[8:10] were 200 and all their Brethren were at
[8:12] their commandment so it said isachar was
[8:15] men were men that had understanding of
[8:17] the
[8:19] times and then
[8:22] Dan Dan the judge so
[8:26] Dan presenting Dan as a judge but also
[8:29] Christ is our judge Dan shall judge his
[8:32] people as one of the tribes of Israel
[8:33] Dan shall be a serpent by the way and
[8:35] adder in the path that bth the horse's
[8:37] heals so that his riter shall fall
[8:39] backward I have waited for thy salvation
[8:41] oh Lord now Dan is really interesting
[8:44] because um in Genesis uh you don't have
[8:46] to turn there but Genesis
[8:48] 46:23 and in all the places where the
[8:51] tribe the sons of the different tribes
[8:53] are listed Dan sons are never listed Dan
[8:57] sons in Genesis 46:23 instead of listing
[9:00] his sons it just lists like their tribal
[9:02] name hushen and in numbers 26:42 instead
[9:05] of listing Dan Sons it just list Shu
[9:08] because Dan's Earthly land was was
[9:11] blotted
[9:13] out in cases where Dan is listed with
[9:16] the other tribes Dan is often far down
[9:18] or even
[9:19] last and Dan was the last tribe to
[9:22] receive an inheritance by
[9:25] Joshua and numbers 10:25 and the
[9:27] standard of the camp of the children of
[9:29] set forward which was the re reward of
[9:31] all the camps throughout their host and
[9:32] over his host was AER so ad Dan went
[9:35] last and when the children of Israel
[9:37] were moving through uh the
[9:43] Israel and it's it's telling that
[9:48] after Jacob makes his Blessing to Dan he
[9:51] says he finishes what with I have waited
[9:54] for thy salvation oh Lord
[10:02] almost
[10:03] done then g a troop shall overcoming but
[10:07] he shall be overcome with the
[10:10] last this is speaking of
[10:13] Christ's
[10:15] resurrection and Asher his bread shall
[10:18] be fat and he shall yeld Royal danies
[10:21] he's the bread of
[10:22] life and Gad wanted to land on the east
[10:25] side of Jordan before uh let's see
[10:29] Gad uh when the when Joshua was
[10:32] partitioning out the land Gad wanted to
[10:33] land on the east side of Jordan before
[10:35] Canan was divided among the 12 tribes so
[10:37] he kind of jumped the gun and said I'll
[10:39] take this I don't want to cross St
[10:41] Jordan I'll just take this over this and
[10:42] because of that he had to fight the rest
[10:45] of his the rest of the time they were in
[10:48] the in Israel in the
[10:56] land said the way they have Fellowship
[10:58] 19 5 look when Israel was dividing up
[11:01] their lands there I was I believe it was
[11:02] gab was one of them and perhaps the half
[11:04] tribe they didn't go over into the
[11:06] promised land they stayed on this side
[11:09] borderline and then napali naftali is a
[11:12] hind let loose he giveth goodly
[11:16] words and naali is the cities of the
[11:19] cities of capernium Betha tzin uh the
[11:23] cities where a lot of the things that
[11:25] Jesus did were done were done in naali
[11:29] so he prophesied about giving goodly
[11:31] words and then uh
[11:35] Joseph represents Christ Joseph is a
[11:38] fruitful bow
[11:41] um he promised fruitfulness the double
[11:45] blessing the blessing of a multitude of
[11:46] Nations um in ezekiel's Millennial
[11:48] prophecy Ezekiel 47 Joseph has allocated
[11:51] two portions a double portion and Joseph
[11:53] was a shepherd of Israel just as Jesus
[11:55] is and Benjamin now this is the one I
[11:57] mentioned earlier about Benjamin being a
[11:59] um a
[12:01] strange this this a blessing verse
[12:06] 27 a strange blessing for one that was
[12:09] the apple of of his father's eye
[12:11] Benjamin shall Raven as a wolf in the
[12:13] morning he shall Devour the prey and at
[12:15] night he shall divide the
[12:22] SP and this depicts Christ as a terrible
[12:25] Warrior our our defense and uh
[12:30] all down through history the heroes of
[12:32] this tribe were marked by their f for
[12:33] fierceness and they're willing to go to
[12:35] battle ahood and King s igland that's
[12:38] one my favorite bible stories to tell
[12:39] the kids about stuck his sword in the
[12:42] big fat king igland and eud and King
[12:46] Saul were both of this tribe and and
[12:48] Paul Saul of Tarsus was of this tribe
[12:51] and uh so if you kind of look back down
[12:53] through all the different tribes that
[12:55] they all look forward to Christ
[12:57] Reuben his prophecy was speaking of the
[13:01] he said the Excellence and dignity of
[13:03] Christ person he's the firstborn the
[13:05] excellent Excellency of dignity and the
[13:07] Excellency of power seon and Levi speak
[13:10] of of the of the sacrifice on the cross
[13:12] and the dispersement of Israel the
[13:14] prophesy of of Judah the Lord's kingship
[13:16] zebulun The Refuge and Haven of Rest
[13:19] disar his service Dan a judge Gad his
[13:24] resurrection the Asher the bread of life
[13:27] and naali
[13:29] um goodly words the uh prophecy of
[13:32] Joseph is a millennial Reign and
[13:34] Benjamin is our terrible Warrior and our
[13:37] defense and uh let's stop
[13:43] there good job
