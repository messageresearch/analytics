better gift gift than that than the person than the giver you see I can be I can have the gift you know but but it's better the gift is supposed to always remind remind me of The Giver so sometimes we just get the gift and that's it but we get the gift it should always remind us of The Giver amen so we just we just appreciate brother Dale appreciate sister Peggy thank you foren for for a good time we had Sunday and uh just a quick uh announcements uh just wanted to uh to mention to you all you all remember us in your prayers uh uh we're we're going to be heading out for Nicaragua on January 11th through the 23rd so we'll be there about two weeks and it'll only be Nicaragua this time just one country last time it was three countries and it's only it'll only be for two weeks not seven and a half weeks like last time but during this time uh frame the the the the Youth Camp that is usually held uh by byc um the brother Mike Sebert started back back in the 60s 7s I believe it was and uh they do a similar Youth Camp down in in Nicaragua and he started that back in the '90s I believe and so uh we're going to be we're going to be there during that time and this time I'm going to take uh we're going to have brother Bob black with us so and I'm thoroughly looking forward to it as I know he is and this will be his I guess this will be your first mission trip right so I figure he got his passport might as well take him out get him to do something that I told the brothers down there uh that you know I believe that the people down there will benefit from his ministry as well and so we're not going to just be part of the Youth Camp that's there we're also going to me ministering to the briad of Christ and and other churches around the area as well and uh and I'll be his interpreter so I'll be preaching along with him but I won't be preaching but uh uh so you just pray for us we're also going to take a few of the youth from here Nyla is going to be gone with us uh Michael Michael pungu he's going to be going with us and uh I believe that's it from here yeah well my daughters they're they're going obviously and then there's uh there's there's uh uh Sister Jordan from Texas she's going to be going so she's going to be coming as well amen and so we're looking to have a good time and I believe it'll be a good experience for for for the Youth as well I say if you can go out of the country at least one time in your life and not to just vacation or go on a cruise but actually live with the people it'll change your life it'll make you see things much different it'll make you appreciate what you have and so that's that's kind of what what one of the the hopes of this trip is so you remember us in your prayers as we'll be doing that also remember me in your prayers I'll I'll be speaking in South Carolina on on the 18th so for brother Jean Williams he he messaged me today and I told him that should be fine so I'm waiting for his reply so you remember us in your prayer as well for that if you have your Bibles this evening let's turn to 2 Timothy chapter 3 I appreciate your patience second Timothy chapter 3 i w to when us I know that maybe we've heard these questions before but and if the brothers back there uh um I'll just what I'll do they're listen I what I'll do is I'll just uh I'll just use my phone just to show the video and the and the and the images so um so they can pull up the scriptures but I know that that in dealing with people we always um we always have to deal with these questions and and and you know and a lot of our youth they're having to deal with these questions you know the the the more and more uh uh the everything's becoming more secularized and and the youth are the people are are being led to believe more in science than the word of God there's even there's even there's a there's a there's a theme or there's a almost like a religion it's called scientism and it's it's the it's the it's where if science can't prove it then it doesn't exist and it doesn't it's not reality and sometimes us as Christians we tend to almost believe more in science than we do word of God the word of God tells us something and it clearly directly says something but yet because NASA said something or you know we kind of just lean more towards NASA cuz they know better than God that's kind of the attitude that we take sometimes or or not just be nasy the government said so they know more than God cuz we're advaned we've Advanced more than God but I you know what I'd rather stay with the word of God cuz the word of God is God breathed God breathed his word amen and he knew the beginning from the end that's only knows up to a certain point government knows up to a certain point am but God knows for through all eternity amen amen so so here's a dilemma that our people the people have today is can we trust a book that is written by man H how do I know that it's even true how do I know that the Bible is true mhm right how do you know that the Bible is true why are we so consumed with the word of God that that that that that it you know we we believe that it's the word of God and what's so special about the Bible from any other book that you might find in the library so we want to talk about that this this this evening let's read 2 Timothy chap 3:1 says here but thou H has fully known my Doctrine this is Paul Paul speaking to to Timothy a young man right a young man he was a young man but thou H has fully known my Doctrine manner of life purpose Faith longsuffering charity patience persecutions afflictions which came unto me at Antioch at Iconium at lisra what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me I'm sure we can all say the same thing too yay and all that will live Godly in Christ Jesus will have a flowery bed of ease it doesn't say that does it shall suffer persecution shall suffer persecution but evil man and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but watch what he says here but continue thou in the things which thou Hast learned and Hast been assured of knowing of whom thou Hast learned them and and that from a child thou H has known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus so Paul here is saying that these scriptures will make you wise but they can they can only work only if you have faith in them as well without faith you can't the scripture can't help you all scripture this is the scripture I want to say all scripture all is given by inspiration of God right amen and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works praise the Lord Jesus let's just bow our heads our heavenly father we just thank you once again for the opportunity to open back the pages of your word we ask that you would forgive us first of all Lord for our sins and iniquities Lord God cleanse us father for sometimes we we get out out of Step Lord we air father in the way Lord through our thoughts through the things we do the things we say we ask you father for forgiveness now Lord we pray Lord that you would cleanse us father from all unrighteousness and we ask that you would just help us here tonight Lord as we endeav to just open back the pages of your word and just look at this here father God of the assurance that you've given us through your through your scriptures Lord God help us father to leave here edified and you glorified Lord for we ask these things now in Jesus Christ's name name amen you may be seated Amen brother brandham States here in in in in Satan's Eden he he says this he says that all that's all I know to tell you that this Bible I believe with all my heart if I know my heart to be the perfect unad unad unad unadulterated word of God goodness what a tongue twister there by this I live by this I stand right brother and if I had 10,000 lives look what he says here if I had 10,000 lives in other words if he could live over 10,000 times I'd like to give every bit of it for this word for it's the word of Jesus Christ amen and I don't care how much they can try to disprove it how much science tries to say it isn't trustworthy and so forth to me it's the only thing in the world I can trust it's this word amen he is mine I love him don't you praise the Lord so there's nothing better that we could put our bank our souls on and in some places brother Baron says where I can Bank my soul on but the word of God Amen the word of God doesn't change his mind God doesn't say one thing at one place and then later on he changes his mind what it says is exactly what it means do you really believe that so sometimes we try to explain something away well he didn't mean that way exactly because see science now tells us I don't think so yeah it means exactly what it says praise the Lord Jesus second Peter 1:16 tells us this it says for we have not followed cunningly devised fables amen when we made known unto you this is Peter talking now Peter was an eyewitness of what happened in the life of Jesus so he knew F first account he saw the things that he was talking about so he knew what he was talking about right but he says here for we have not followed cunningly devised fables in other words stories amen when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but were eyewitnesses of his Majesty amen you know what Peter Peter was I mean he he went through it all with the life of Jesus he went through the good times with Jesus he went through bad times with Jesus and he went through good and bad times without Jesus I mean just a man that that that came to a point where he denied Jesus three times fulfilling what Jesus had said to him directly that that's what you were going to do and he said I won't do it and he did it and he kept he he that followed I'm sure followed him all the rest of his life but you know what Jesus never rubbed that in his face he just said you're just you just fulfilled what I told you you fulfilled my word right so so what a wonderful thing and Peter here is a witness for he says here for he received from God the Father honor and Glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent Glory this is my beloved Son in whom I well please is talking about Jesus and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the Holy Mount we also we have also a more sure word of Prophecy what he says here we have also a more sure word of Prophecy am now you say you might you might you might think well the the New Testament I'm I don't know if I can if I can trust it now I don't even know if I could trust the Old Testament but Jesus trusted the Old Testament enough because part really he quoted it many many times so if you can't believe Jesus then you really don't believe the Old Testament either because because for one Jesus is the word that went through the Old Testament right and then here he is in the form of the Holy Spirit speaking through these men here in the New Testament amen so it's Jesus Christ from Genesis to revelation amen we have also a more sure word of Prophecy where unto ye do well watch that you do you do well that ye take heed in other words you listen and you and you you and you you listen to it as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day Dawn and the day star rise in your hearts knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scripture let me say that again that no prophecy of of the scripture No No scripture or no Bible verse is of any private interpretation what does that mean it means that it didn't come privately or somebody just thought of just writing that right right right no n somebody lived it out and then it it happened and somebody pinned it out and we're going to take a look here at some things as to what will help you to know why can I trust the scriptures why can I trust the Bible yeah for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man right so it wasn't it no man ever thought about the word of God the way it's written no right man nobody ever found the word of God hidden under a rock somewhere and say well we're just going to publish this book we found under book never because too many I mean the word of God has changed lives and the the fact that that it causes people to die for this word something is something is taking place I mean there was thousands millions of people that actually willing to give up their life they weren't just dragged to to the to the Stables or to the crosses to get hung they willingly walked in there and said for this I die for this I stand just as brother Brandon was saying amen the question is are you willing to do that or will something happen or take place or come to your life that would want to make you not even stand for this word the way you should my for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy man of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost amen now these are these are eyewitness accounts of the life of Jesus this is Luke right here uh in Luke chap 1 and I'm just kind of putting this as a foundation I'm I'll I'll read a little quicker and comment less Luke 1 1-4 says for as much as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed Among Us so they believed these things even as they delivered them unto us which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and Ministers of the word it seemed good to me also having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first to write unto thee in order most excellent Theophilus that thou mightest know this is why he's writing that that Luke was writing his biography is it biography or of Jesus right that thou what is it biography is that that thou mightest know the certainty of those things wherein thou H has been instructed amen so Luke wasn't of the disciples he he he wasn't probably there like maybe Peter was the whole time amen so how did Luke get all of these things amen must have been that the Holy Spirit was at work cuz the Holy Spirit knows all things amen and the Holy Spirit is that word which is Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord Jesus so so let's look here at some at some at at some history here now the word bible it comes from the Latin word which is Biblia Biblia and that that's actually the Spanish word for Bible corre that's why it's easy for me to remember that comes from the Latin word bible which means a collection of books that's what that word means so that's where we get the word bibl which is a library right we use bibla in Spanish and so that that that's the word bible now ask this question why why should I trust the Bible why should I trust the Bible young people I know that sometimes the Devil comes and he comes to you directly and says why you've been in you've been going to church and listening to the to the word of God the message you're listening to all this why should I even trust it isn't it just like any other book that's written out there isn't it just like what is it what if if some man just just happen to just just just start making things up and just writing things down it's changed too many lives for that to just been just by coincidence and it's still changing lives amen there's never been one person that that that has never been exposed to the word of God that hasn't had some sort of change either for the positive or the negative the word of God changes amen because listen if you if you accept the word it'll be a blessing to you if you reject the word word it'll become a curse to you amen so either way it's going to have an effect on you absolutely amen tell me what book in in in this world can do that right brother Edgar Adam's pose writings that they ever do anything like that no they make you scared and they make you think of a man who man that that dude is a is a [Laughter] freak I me you ever read at girl po stuff I mean it's we used to read the things in in in in uh in high school they would make us write read those things and write something about it there was something weird in in that dude's mind right but they glorify Ed gr and po like he's just this great thing and then you talk about Jesus Christ and his word ah we don't know about that edar Ellen Poe is much more popular than than than Jesus amen the writings of Plato the writings of of of all these different you know you look at those writings and and and and and they they seem to be more popular than than than Jesus on the surface but the Bible has been the most uh sold book that there ever has has been so so why why should I trust the Bible well for one there's archaeological evidence yeah Genesis and in Exodus there's archaeological evidence of the things that was said people have gone back and actually have seen what the Bible talks about I can think of Sodom and gomorra right Sodom and Gomorrah right there exactly the way the Bible talks about it they they you can go over there and actually pick up the sulfur balls and the things that fell from you might have to dig them out a little bit but there's videos on YouTube you can go look and people set fire to them and everything how did those sulfur ball suur sulfur balls get to I can't even talk tonight go for balls get there if the scripture amen exactly didn't what happened there didn't happen you know it was said in the scripture as I said it's the bestselling book of all time y um another example is that you know the Red Sea crossing right I don't know if you there's there's there's documentaries where they've actually found the possible places where where the the the children of Israel have crossed and they've actually have found like chariot wheels and things right there at the bottom of the ocean so I mean how did that get there amen you see so so it's just it's like I said it's not just a book that somebody just just happened to just find under a rock amen amen but it's something that's actually changing lives if you take it to heart if you have faith in it praise the Lord now here's here's one thing that you can you can look at with regards to the word of God and it's the honesty test the honesty test now the writers of the of the of the Bible if if they wanted to lie if they wanted to say just make up all these things and say just all kinds of lies to you why not just say beautiful things and nice things about themselves the whole time no instead we find Moses who is one of the writers of the Bible writing things about himself that you probably would not even mention about about about yourself that's right remember he wrote the first I believe it's the first five books of the of of the Bible that's right and end there you'll find where where Moses he wrote where he was supposed to speak to the Rock and instead he got upset and struck the Rock and because of that he was not able to go into the promised land Exodus I believe it's Exodus that tells us about that who wrote that Moses himself so he wrote something negative about himself right you take for example uh uh uh uh uh let's see uh when the John you know when when he was when when he was talking about that the disciples were arguing with each other about who's the greatest in the Kingdom they were fussing with each other about who's the greatest in the Kingdom but that's there for our our benefit that's right right but they would write negative things about their experiences as well look at Paul right he wrote about himself going and persecuting the Christians and killing them what good writer I mean what what writer would write things about himself that way I mean I would just write just nice flowery things just the way people do it on Facebook nowadays they show an image of yourself that it's really not you but these these writers of the word didn't write just flowery beautiful things about themselves or their experiences they wrote negative things as well amen so that is one of the reasons why you can trust the word of God because these writers were honest about their experiences about the things that they went through I just didn't have I just didn't see Miracles I also failed the Lord Jesus I denied the Lord Jesus three times can you imagine the shame and we never find Peter where he rebuked any of the writers of of of the four gospels and told them don't write that about me don't put that in there don't put that in there no he let them amen because that's God inspired amen see Peter didn't understand that he was doing that but it was to be written for our benefit today right right and so sometimes Saints you might find why am I why why have I am I in this situation I have fallen in this situation I'm in this situation but God might use that for a benefit for somebody else later on right Peter's downfall Peter's uh occasion of of of that caused him to cry became a blessing to you and me yeah amen if we make a mistake Jesus won't rub it in our face thank you Lord amen he's willing to forgive praise the lord we can look through all the scriptures Hosea he wrote about himself what did Hosea do Hosea wrote about himself asking God asked him to marry a prostitute right that's in the Bible now there was a purpose for that and you just go back in the Bible and read it amen that's right but he wrote that about himself about his experience amen praise the Lord amen and then of course Paul persecuted the Christians and all these men they gave their time and their lives for the faith of Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord Jesus and in looking at some of for example the the way the the the disciples some of the disciples the way they died some of them died horrible deaths think about it Peter was crucified was crucified and he told him don't crucify me the way my Lord was crucified he said crucify me upside down amen that's how that's how much he was willing to die and if they were telling lies why not just recant right there and say oh no I don't believe this God this Jesus and I don't want you know they were willing to die for it they were willing to die so if there's you can go back and read the Histories on on on on the disciples on the way they died I believe the only one that died of old age a natural was John was John I think he died was like 90 something years old all the other ones they were they were persecuted they were they were they they died horrible deaths so to me Saints that tells me amen that these author these authors of the Bible these authors of this of the gospels they were more concerned about truth than they were about themselves they were more concerned about giving you the truth than they were about their own even their own lives so young people that's the re one of the reasons why you can trust the word of God don't Satan comes around saying that's just a man's book you you get no it's it's the word inspired the breathed out word of God praise the Lord Jesus all right there's another test that we can we can look at and and that is that is what it's called the the time Gap test and it's the time for when when the author wrote the original manuscript to the time of a copy of that manuscript was written amen so when the Bible was written let's say let's just think about the The Book of Luke when the Book of Luke was written to the time that it was written until the time that there was a copy of that manuscript amen there wasn't but Pro less than 50 years that had took place cuz remember when some back then when they would copy things it wasn't through text message and it wasn't through email it was handwritten somebody had to look at the original manuscripts and to make copies of the of the manuscripts of the Bible they had to sit there and pen that manually so if you let a lot of time pass by from the time that the original manuscript took place was written to the time that a copy came to be written if if there's a lot if there if there's a great wide Gap there then there's things that are going to be missing that's right amen there's things that are liable to be missing but the word of God isn't that that way it's about less than 50 years amen that that from the time that let's just say the Book of Luke that that that the the manuscript of the gospels was was written the copies of it was written then right it's kind of it's kind of interesting too that the message of the hour the message that God's given us you you see how quickly it was transcribed right yeah it it wasn't transcribed now my wife she knows all about transcription because that's what she does it's not an easy job if you think that sitting there listening and and and typing especially listening to brother Brandon yeah is is is tough and I'm just thankful for these Brethren that took their time to do that these sisters that do that that we can now read the message and not just not just here amen praise the Lord so but but during that time that the message was was was was you know brother Brandon preached the message it wasn't too long after that that it was put put in text in text amen amen now you can look here for example there is a Roman historian by the name of plyy the younger the time Gap from when he wrote his manuscripts to the copies that that we have now 750 years past but he's an authority yeah he's a he's a pop historian the time Gap that we have of Caesar's writings to now to the to the manuscripts that of his original writings to the to the copies is a thousand years that had passed Plato's time gap of his writings is 12200 years and then Alexander the Great's time Gap is 400 years but the Bibles was less than 50 years but we say well these men existed Alexander the Great existed Plato and all these men they they existed but I don't know about Jesus I I don't know about him you see how the devil Works absolutely I don't know if we can trust what he said you know but we'll read Plato and Alexander the Great and and and all all these all these men all day long praise the Lord amen amen they no nobody questions these historical figures existence but but when it comes to Jesus he's he's questioned whether he existed or not amen praise God now another test that we can do is how many manuscripts are available all all we know about Caesar is that only 10 there's only 10 manuscripts of his writings all right I know this is kind of just bear with me okay we're getting to something we're getting to something all there's only about 10 manuscripts of his writing about Plato's it's about seven manuscripts of his writings amen there is a there was a Roman historian by the name of tacitus he had 20 manuscripts guess how many manuscripts the Bible has I want I want to take a guess brother way 24,636 manuscripts of the word that are available and the number keeps going up right the second most manuscripts that are available out there for any book is the is The Iliad written by Homer and and that has only 643 manuscripts that that is a difference of 23,990 the Bible has many more manuscripts so these manuscrip and and these things have been passed down from and God has guarded these things so that we can enjoy it today in in in this book form so that we can enjoy it today in even in tablet form praise God right am so you don't tell me that Jesus Christ is not more popular than than Homer I I I can't nobody died for Homer but somebody died for Jesus Christ amen throughout throughout time amen and then there's another there's another thing that you can look at is the corroboration test do what are there other historical materials or writings that corroborate or deny the testimony of the Bible and in looking into this there's there are nine non-Christian sources and 33 Christian sources that mention Jesus within 150 years of his death so there's other sources outside of the Bible that mention Jesus in his life all right so there's about 42 known sources that we know that tiberious Caesar and the Roman Emperor at the time of Jesus lived he had only 10 sources that mention him within the 150 years of his life amen but we say he's more real than Jesus is no I don't think so Jesus had he had more four times more resources amen right so we know that outside of the Bible that Jesus lived performed Miracles and that people believed on him him outside of the Bible there's there's coroporation of that now let's let me ask you this question why is the Bible in letter [Music] form why couldn't Jesus why couldn't the Lord just given it to us in video format from the beginning why couldn't he just give it to us in images gifs animated gifs we like to text with animated gifs nowaday days yeah why can't why can't it be that way and I want to give you all an example so we got props today if the brothers could pull pull pull my phone up if that don't mind all right I see you okay all right here is this picture right here and I want someone to tell me who these people are can somebody just take a guess yes Sarah Mary and Jose Mary and Joseph by looking at that picture you think Mary Joseph okay all right anybody else one Josh just whatever whatever comes to your mind that that is okay says me and Sister Christine all right sister Anna Canard what do you think just a man and a woman to me just a just a a couple couple a couple okay a couple all right what if I told you that it's a brother and a sister named Tommy and Caitlyn on a trip to Spain with each of their F own families while each of their families were sightseen Caitlyn asked Tommy's wife Andrea if she could take a picture of her and her brother since they don't have many pictures together and haven't taken one together in a long time so Andrea did let's just say if this was a picture now how do you know that's true there's got to be an element of Faith there now do you know that I that I looked at this picture and I'm the one who made that up cuz that's what I saw when I saw that picture but you see you took my word for it amen right that's why so sometimes we just have to take the word of God at that same way amen why is it that the Lord didn't give us the word of God in picture form right because there will be all these different interpretations of what of what C something is whereas in text you just saw that I could give details exactly of what that of what that was well what was in my mind and what we read in the word of God is what was in the mind of God Amen amen you see how why why it's so important to read amen God could have given us us to us in in a different format but he chose to give it to us in text form because it could be in more details amen right and it could also produce an image in your mind as you're reading right it transcends you to the to the place there's some places in the word of God that you're reading and it goes into details and it's almost like if you're there right right praise the Lord I'm going to play this video right here I want you to tell me somebody tell me what they what what they think it is yeah there is a doggy underneath there all right Bella what do you think it is you no guess anybody want to take one guess just one guess brother waade father and a daughter father and a daughter that's what I'd say okay you got father and a daughter what if I told you that this was a brother and a sister sitting together at a park bench the sister is trying to comfort her brother as he talks to him because as he talks to her because he just lost his wife due to cancer a few weeks prior the sister understands what her brother is going through because she had lost her husband in a car accident and she was left a widow 4 years prior now so you couldn't get all those details just watching that video you see what I'm saying but I just read you in text form or something I just made up but you you believed it [Laughter] right same thing with the word of God why that's why the word of God is so important that it's in text format amen right amen all right and then here's picture number three oh I don't even know what that picture [Laughter] is yeah yeah I was giving Joe massage that's what it [Laughter] is hopefully I woke some of you up amen it definitely wasn't recent Joe Joe looks a little younger there all right so does the point come across as to why reading the word of God is so important and why thank God that He gave it to us in text form amen now let's talk about the alive word amen why the alive word is still so relevant for us today amen amen 2 Timothy 3 tells us this verse 16 we we just read it but we'll read it here again all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works now we know that what makes perfect is the holy spirit amen but what the holy spirit is in his word amen he the word is is the Holy Ghost amen praise God he is his word Jesus said in one place my words are spirit and their life amen so as you receive the word as you read the word the text of the word and you're taking it in by faith then it can do something for you it's breathing life into you Amen in in in in in the NIV version this scripture says it this way it says all scripture is God God breathed amen and is useful for teaching rebuking correcting and training and righteousness and in the ESV version it says all scripture is breathed out by God Amen and profitable for teaching for reprove for correction and so forth so all scripture is God breathe which also explains the alive and active word of God amen amen it's the alive and active word of God Amen meaning that we can take a scripture the scriptures that were written back then during the time of Moses and we can apply it to our lives today we can bring that word all the way from Genesis and put it in some application here in 2022 tell me what book in in the world can do that a book that was written in the 1800s you would not be able to put everything and apply it to our day but the word word of God you can amen amen because why again the word of God is God breathed is alive amen so it's active amen it's working it's changing it's moving God is always moving amen he's never stopping he never he he's never uh uh he never stops he's always in motion and that as he moves we move praise God now now it in thinking about this it takes me back to Genesis 2:7 where God breathed into Adam let's read that real quick and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living Soul amen when you look at the at the uh the strongest concordance there the word breathed it means to breathe to blow amen and then where it talks about about the breath the breath it's a puff it's the word uh nismat to breathe is the word way and and the the breath the nmat a puff wind angry vital breath watch a divine inspiration right brother amen what is the word of God all word of God is inspired amen a divine inspiration intellect an animal of life it's the word Haim alive raw fresh strong life and then you take you take where it says there in Genesis 27 he became Adam became a living Soul a living is Haya and it's not ha but it's ha alive raw fresh strong life and then the word soul is nefes what's this Soul self life creature person appetite mind living being desire emotion passion that which breathes is the breathing substance or being Soul the inner being of man amen so God actually breathed into him amen gave him his soul yes sir praise God in Genesis 2:7 praise the Lord now we're all created by God All Souls are mine says the Lord amen praise God Amen that's your decision if you want that soul to either continue with God or be destroyed at some point in time in your life yeah how horrible it is to one day think that you you you exist no more no right brother amen and that you can't enjoy the things that are coming Hereafter praise God now I want you to think about this because we see that the scripture amen it it it it's inspired amen and and and and look at the difference amen the difference between Adam being alive and and the living word amen now I want you to think about this Adam was dead when when God breathed into him I mean he wasn't he wasn't living it wasn't until God breathed into him that he became a living Soul right but the scripture is not that way the scripture is alive as it comes out of God praise the Lord Jesus amen is it is not it's not word it's alive and it's a creative word amen it's not dead so when Paul was said was saying that all scripture was is inspired by God there in all scripture is given by inspiration of God he's not saying that if you read the word then get inspired then that's when the word of God becomes inspiring no the word of God from the beginning from the get-go is already inspired praise the Lord Jesus but now what that word is wanting to do is wanting to come in and and and live and come into a vessel to become a Living Word through somebody it's already living it already has life amen it already can create but now it wants to come in and live itself through you and I through a vessel the best example I could give is probably when in Isaiah chapter 7 that it was prophesied Isaiah said that of virgin shall conceive that word came forth that word was alive when it came forth it just went years and years and that word was still alive it was inspired right it was alive and it finally found a vessel that it can rest in and it was Mary but it was a willing vessel it wasn't just any old 16-year-old girl that was living in Jerusalem or or where where Mary lived at the time no it was a willing vessel that that word that was already inspired when it came out of God's mouth Amen to Isaiah and zah penned it down amen it was already alive now he wanted to rest in Mary and Mary could say be it unto me according to Thy word praise the Lord Jesus amen according to Thy word not my word not my word will but according to Thy word hallelujah amen praise the Lord Jesus so it's it's the word of God is alive and Powerful amen when God said let there be light amen it was so right amen amen it's an alive and active word when it comes forth out of the mouth of God that's why Jesus says that the man should not live by just bread alone that's right that's right but by every word of God Amen that proceeds out of the mouth of God Amen praise the Lord amen why because the word of God causes life the same ho that that caused Adam to live amen will cause you to live amen amen amen receive that same Holy Spirit if you can receive that word amen praise God why is so the word of God why is it so important that we get in the word of God amen amen praise the Lord because we're not just dealing with just a dead letter no sir it's in a way I know we sometimes we say it's dead letter and yes it's dead letter if it's not being lived through someone but remember it was God breathed so it's got life amen it's got life now that life amen wants to come into you amen so that you can replicate that word amen because I mean here in in the pages of the book is not going to do anything but it it becomes more of an inspiration to someone else if it can come into someone and live through you live through them amen amen amen and that's the reason why Paul could say in the gospel in Romans he says this he says for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation it is is a power amen amen it was enough power to create the heavens and the Earth amen and it's enough power to create amen the or do what it needs to do for your life amen to everyone that believeth watch see Mary had to believe amen then it took action right to the Jew first and also to the Greek for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith Faith as it is written the just shall live by faith amen praise the Lord Jesus and that's the same thing Saints with the word of God today amen just as they wanted to find a willing recipient or a willing vessel during the time of Mary it wants to find a a resting place in this hour that we live in let the story of what happened the Christmas story let it not just be in the in in in the in as a story no amen bring it down further Lord let that word of God Amen live in me let me give birth to this word just as Mary gave birth to it in the physical let me give birth to it in the spiritual I want to be not just let me give birth to I want to be born again amen praise the Lord Jesus let it be something active and living and changing me from day to day that as I get in the word of God Amen that it's not just me trying to get through a a whole year of the Bible reading but it's letting that that Bible get through me amen and living through me and changing me praise God Amen sometimes we just want to read the word of God and just oh today's this this scripture reading and then okay I fulfilled my duty for today is it is it alive in you can you go immediately and put it into action because that's what the word of God wants us to do amen praise the Lord Jesus Amen brother Bram says this here in the mark of the beast he says in 1956 and then it ought not to be approached by some mental theology it should be approached by the scripture scripture must answer to scripture we realize that reading the Bible you do not read it like you would a newspaper right man or a magazine or or or or anything that you you you enjoy reading back then it was newspapers because it's been the wisdom of the Holy Spirit to hide many things from the eyes of the wise and prudent and would reveal it to babes such as would learn God wants somebody who's hungry watch this now God wants somebody who's hungry so he can just take them over to one side and set them down and say here it is child of mine this is it isn't that what he did with Mary right he took her to the side this is what this is what's going to be you've been chosen beloved right amen that's what God can do for you take you to the side and reveal things to you that you've never even even thought of that's right that are hidden in his word if you can just take the time to do it y I'm telling you Saints there's so much open in the word of God there's so much in the word of God that we still not not not not not not getting amen for one of the reasons why we're still here amen right yes sir amen praise God something that we're not still getting amen yes praise God so God wants somebody who's hungry so he can just take them over to one side and set them down and say here it is child of mine this is it the world don't understand this but ye shall understand see let it be this way then all scripture given by inspiration then it must be interpreted by inspiration amen and then scripture must compare with scripture you try to they have given challenges to people about sh I'll you know tell me where the Bible contradicts itself and nobody can find nobody can can show that there may be some areas that you may look like and that from the natural human eye it looks like it's contr contradicting itself but that's the reason why we need Revelation amen Revelation just opens the curtain up and lets you see everything clearly amen and who can give Revelation the Holy Ghost amen who's the one that that that has inspired this word brother Brandman says here now we have take now we could take that from a dozen different angles tonight of being the Jewish nation that was cursed and many every word of God written is inspiration and it hooks the whole Bible together on every word in the Bible Bible it's the most wonderful book that was ever written am there's never a piece of literature ever written like the Bible it's the only book in existence tells you where you come from who you are and where you're going tell me tell me what other writer can tell you that amen tell me what what what what Max lucato can can can can tell you that all right Edgar Alan po or or or Mark Twain right they can never tell you where you're going they can entertain you for a while and MOX Lucado he can maybe help you spir in some spiritual areas you know I'm not saying his his information is bad but the one that can hold the destiny of your future is the word of God am because those writings that I just mentioned they're not alive they're not active Max Luc those writings if we if we're here 200 more years amen they probably may be obsolete then not the word of God the word of God right now is fresh it's good for this time if we're here 200 more years the people that are living then they'll be able to benefit from it just as much what an awesome word that we serve amen praise God we've got libraries full and streets full and book rooms full but never one of them none of them none of their great philosophers that's raised and Fallen they have ever never been able to tell us what this Bible has told us and all true science moves right back to the Bible for its evidence amen interesting that that brother Brandon puts that in there amen yeah right we going to read releve science or we going to believe the Bible I'd rather believe the Bible amen amen science got it wrong amen back in the days of Noah I wonder if that's not the same thing that's happening today now sometimes we got our Gods amen our our government gods that are proudly telling us not even the truth that's right I wonder if that that's why Jesus didn't say that if it wasn't like this the days of Noah that today is like the days of Noah everybody's looking up to the sky looking for aliens and looking for all kinds of stuff they got something ready for you yeah you just you wait and see and it ain't what they're telling you right now right so are you going to hold on to the word of God Amen are you going to hold on to NASA or you going to hold on to to science just think about it amen now I want to I want to give this example amen and the you know know sometimes we we we look at the word and and you maybe you might still be thinking well I mean I don't know I still don't know if I could trust it you know but but let's say you receive a text message from someone on your phone right it's got it's a it's a it's a strange number and you've never you've never seen that number before like we a lot of us get text messages nowadays saying hi yeah you better watch it to me when I get those text messages it's time to play it's time to have fun oh yeah and I've had some some some interesting conversations with some of them and they and you know what they turn out to be they turn out to be people from the Middle East India that they somehow they got your phone pH number and they're just trying to be able to get something out of you right so when somebody says hey hi who's this oh isn't this isn't this uh Steve or whatever you know they're trying to start initiate a conversation I had one one the other day that was I initiated a conversation with and uh the uh the the conversation went into a to a point where he started he started cursing and he started and I knew knew right then that it wasn't a it wasn't in Asian it wasn't in China it wasn't because I I mean I've been around Asian people long enough that I just I just know that they're not that way they're very they're very but but and I'm not saying this just just understand me Indian people and and and people like that they they kind of tend to be more that way you see a little bit more abrupt in the way they speak so that's why I thought that maybe hey it might be it might be someone like that sure enough it was it was somebody from I believe it was Pakistan and uh and he and it got to a political talk he said well you Americans you come over here and you take over our land and and all this stuff and and I don't agree with your president and all that stuff I said listen I don't agree with him either he said well you should go over and shoot your president I said listen I I even though I disagree with him that mean I'm not I'm going to go and do that I said because for one I'm a Christian and the word of God prohibits for me to do something like that when after talking longer and he said uh he didn't say anything after that yeah so but I have fun with these people but anyways let's say you receive a text message it's unknown number whatever and and and uh and you're like what in the world who is this right right well you have the right to say who is it because you don't know the person you don't know the number that's writing you but what if you receive a text message but if I receive a text message from Brother Wade he sends me a text message and he says something on there and I know that it's from Brother Wade why because I've had a personal relationship with him I've got his name in my in my contacts I know that that's him I know that that's his number now I don't I don't know if maybe sister June took his phone and sent the text message but I know that it's coming from a reliable source because I have met him and I know him personally and I have his number saved in in my life the device of my life right well that's the same thing with you and and God God gives us his word and to you that don't understand God to you it comes in as a text message that you don't understand who's this from I don't know it's boring amen but if you had a relationship with God you knew you would know exactly where that word's coming from you would know that it's the Lord Jesus Christ that's the name that you have in my in your contacts amen and you would and you would reply to that message and you would do it with confidence because you know that you are replying to a reliable source amen that's the word of God we're not serving cunningly devices or fables or anything like that it's the true word of God Saints and if the word said it I believe it and that settles it for me amen amen amen that settles it for me praise the Lord Jesus listen even for brother brandom he said if I say something outside of the word of God he said you don't have to take my word that's right he said you stay with the absolute amen amen and the absolute wasn't him the absolute is his word the word of God his word brother brandom amen we know that his life and the and what he preached amen reflected back from the absolute amen amen but if something that brother brandham said amen doesn't line up with the word I don't have to take what brother brandham said that sounds scary I don't know if I should but it's what came first amen the Bible or or the me or the message right what was inspired right amen amen now don't get don't get me wrong I'm not trying to say anything by that because there's there sometimes people bring it as if it's a competition I'd rather have the Bible than the message or the message before the Bible because the message is the revelation of this no amen there's some things that brother brandom said they were his own opinion too but there was a lot of things with regards to the word that was thus sayth the Lord and if you don't receive it then you are rejecting God right amen amen praise the Lord Jesus exactly right so I want to stay with the word amen I want to stay with the message of the hour because I know the message took me back to the word praise the Lord so a a god breathed word produces a god breathed life amen let let the word of God breathe on you tonight amen let's stand to our feet praise the Lord am man is let's just uh thank you let's just bow our heads if anybody has need of prayer more than welcome to pray with you almighty God we just thank you Lord once again for the opportunity to open back the pages of your word we just
