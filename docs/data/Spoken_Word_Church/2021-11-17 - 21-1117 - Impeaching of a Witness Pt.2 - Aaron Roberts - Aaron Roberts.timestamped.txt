[23:06] tonight and lord we just ask all things
[23:08] in the name of jesus christ we pray amen
[23:12] amen john chapter 3
[23:15] beginning at verse 31 he said he that
[23:17] cometh from above is above all he that
[23:20] is of the earth is earthly
[23:23] and speaketh of the earth and he that
[23:25] cometh from heaven is above all
[23:27] and what he has seen and heard that he
[23:29] testifieth and no man receiveth his
[23:32] testimony
[23:34] he that hath received his testimony has
[23:36] set to his seal that god is true
[23:39] for he whom god has sent speaketh the
[23:41] words of god for god hath not
[23:45] for god giveth not the spirit by measure
[23:48] unto him
[23:49] the father loveth the son and hath given
[23:51] all things into his hand
[23:53] he that believeth on the son hath
[23:55] everlasting life and he that believeth
[23:57] not the son shall not see life but the
[24:00] wrath of god abideth on him
[24:03] acts chapter 1 beginning at verse 1 it
[24:06] says this former treatise
[24:09] have i made oath theophilus of all that
[24:11] jesus began to do and teach unto the day
[24:14] in which he was taken up after that
[24:18] he through the holy ghost had given
[24:20] commandments unto the disciples whom he
[24:22] had chosen to whom also he shoot himself
[24:25] alive after his passion by many
[24:27] infallible proofs being seen of them
[24:29] forty days and speaking of the things
[24:31] pertaining to the kingdom of god and
[24:33] being assembled together with them
[24:35] commanded them that they should not
[24:37] depart from jerusalem but wait for the
[24:39] promise of the father which
[24:42] saith he ye have heard of me
[24:46] for john truly baptized with water but
[24:48] ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost
[24:50] not many days hence when they therefore
[24:54] were come together they asked of him
[24:56] saying lord will thou at this time
[24:58] restore again the kingdom of israel and
[25:00] he said unto them it is not for you to
[25:02] know the times or the seasons which the
[25:05] father hath put in his own power but you
[25:07] shall receive power that after the holy
[25:10] ghost has come upon you and you shall be
[25:12] witnesses unto me both in jerusalem
[25:15] and in all judea and in samaria
[25:18] and unto the uttermost part
[25:20] of the earth
[25:22] amen you all be seated god bless you
[25:30] now i want to
[25:32] pick up
[25:33] speaking on
[25:34] impeaching of a witness
[25:38] and
[25:40] this is from the
[25:42] testimony of a true witness
[25:46] and brother bram says now a testimony
[25:48] before a person
[25:49] has to the person has to have an
[25:51] experience before they can testify if
[25:53] you were in if you were called in court
[25:55] you'd have
[25:57] you have as give a testimony you have to
[26:00] know something before you can testify
[26:03] and a witness is a person that has seen
[26:05] something he knows that it is the truth
[26:08] and they're called to give witness and
[26:09] then a witness must know what he's
[26:11] talking about
[26:12] he must not
[26:14] someone told me a certain certain thing
[26:16] he must be the witness himself if not
[26:19] he's not speaking
[26:21] of someone else that could be a witness
[26:23] at the scene
[26:25] he's not speaking of someone else there
[26:26] could be a witness at the scene now i
[26:28] think that being that we see
[26:31] out from our congregation this life is
[26:33] so fragile then that death is so
[26:34] positive we need to come to a place that
[26:37] we are positive sure that this is what
[26:39] we speak of it what that we speak of is
[26:41] right see it is not so it is not
[26:45] nothing that you can just haphazardly as
[26:47] we say accept it you've got to be
[26:50] positive sure that that's right because
[26:52] we do not know what kind of end that we
[26:54] will come to right
[26:57] and he said that's one of the reasons
[26:58] why i'm a calvinistic thinker of
[27:00] security of believer is because that i
[27:02] believe that when a man or woman is in
[27:04] their right mind that is
[27:07] that is the time to accept the lord
[27:08] jesus and get it all settled down once
[27:11] forever because when we come to the end
[27:13] of the road we don't want we don't know
[27:15] just where and how we're going to be
[27:17] sick we may be sick in our mind we may
[27:20] have a fever that could really cook or
[27:23] really cook our very brain
[27:25] we might say something or do something
[27:27] at the end of the road we don't know but
[27:28] you see if you're already if we have
[27:31] already anchored in christ no matter
[27:33] what sickness takes us what condition we
[27:35] are when we go it's already settled we
[27:37] are sealed until the day of our
[27:38] redemption ephesians 4 30 says grieve
[27:41] not the holy spirit of god whereby you
[27:44] are sealed until the day not of your
[27:46] death but of your redemption see when
[27:49] death's done over you're still sealed
[27:54] i i love that and
[27:57] you know
[27:58] because
[27:59] you know in in today's news there's a
[28:01] lot that has been going on about
[28:04] witnesses and testifying and
[28:06] impeaching and
[28:08] you know
[28:10] so to be a witness
[28:12] as the scripture says here
[28:15] as we were reading in john you know it
[28:17] talks about jesus coming that jesus was
[28:20] a witness
[28:21] and he had a testimony to give and and
[28:24] and he had to make this thing sure
[28:27] but then when he called to the disciples
[28:29] he spoke the same thing and said you
[28:30] shall be witnesses
[28:32] of the same exact same thing because
[28:34] when jesus came and brought the truth he
[28:37] said these things and he said he that
[28:39] receiveth these things he said have
[28:41] everlasting life which is exactly what
[28:45] took place in acts 2 when they received
[28:48] because they received the word that
[28:49] jesus held that jesus spoke and then
[28:52] when they come then it was their time to
[28:54] testify and if they became the witness
[28:56] that jesus was
[28:58] and so we we see how you know you have
[29:00] to have a testimony
[29:02] a true testimony
[29:04] to be a witness and god has called each
[29:06] one to be a witness and as we were
[29:08] speaking of last time you know there's
[29:10] there's three witnesses that we that we
[29:12] look at and you know god is a witness or
[29:15] jesus is a witness and we know the
[29:17] devil's a witness
[29:18] and you and i are called to be witnesses
[29:20] and that's the three witnesses that that
[29:22] we have and to know that that we are
[29:25] witnessing and to know what we've heard
[29:27] and what what we believe in to see these
[29:29] things and
[29:30] and you know to it
[29:32] to be a witness then you know the first
[29:34] thing that happens when you become a
[29:36] witness is in a court trial and and
[29:39] we've seen
[29:41] uh
[29:42] very you know a lot of
[29:44] high prior profile court cases in in the
[29:47] news and you know the first thing they
[29:49] want to do is they try to impeach the
[29:50] witness
[29:52] you know that's that's the first thing i
[29:54] want to do and
[29:55] and to and the word impeach
[29:58] you know it means to dispute or
[30:00] disparage deny or contradict to attempt
[30:03] to approve that a witness has not told
[30:05] the truth or has been inconsistent by
[30:08] introducing contrary evidence including
[30:11] statements made outside of the courtroom
[30:14] depositions or statements of the witness
[30:16] heard by another
[30:18] so when we so when we go to look you
[30:20] know the first thing that you want to do
[30:22] is you want to try and impeach a witness
[30:25] because you know like brother brown said
[30:26] when you come into the courtroom you've
[30:27] got to know what the truth is and you've
[30:29] got to be able to speak the truth and
[30:30] you've got to and you've got to have a
[30:32] firm grip a firm understanding of the
[30:34] situation and so when when jesus came
[30:38] and he began to speak you know he he
[30:40] began to speak there and and john he
[30:42] talked about being being a witness of
[30:44] the father and you know he didn't speak
[30:47] of himself but he said he spoke of what
[30:49] the father had said to him and he said
[30:51] the son can do nothing of himself except
[30:53] what he sees the father do he said that
[30:55] do what the son likewise he was a
[30:57] witness of what he had seen and he began
[30:59] to do that and he began to manifest that
[31:01] was what god had called him to do is to
[31:03] be a witness of what he of who he was
[31:06] because we know that was the fulfillment
[31:07] of the word because the word had come
[31:09] down through the ages through the
[31:11] prophets and and the and the uh
[31:13] patriarchs and all and then he began and
[31:16] became the full manifestation of the
[31:18] word and there he was and he stepped out
[31:19] on and he began to speak and began to
[31:22] point the people back to the scriptures
[31:23] and and tell them who he was and what he
[31:26] came to do and he began to identify who
[31:28] they were
[31:29] but you know the thing is is they had to
[31:31] they had to believe who what what god
[31:33] said about them
[31:35] you know because you know when he when
[31:37] he came to the the pharisees and the
[31:39] sadducees and they they began to speak
[31:41] and they said you know our father is
[31:43] abraham and he said if he said if you
[31:45] knew who abraham was he said if your
[31:46] father had been abraham he said you'd
[31:48] rejoice to see my day because he said
[31:51] abraham longed to see this day abraham
[31:53] rejoiced to see this day and he longed
[31:55] to see these things and he said now that
[31:57] you are sitting here as as the children
[31:59] of abraham and you deny what the word
[32:01] says
[32:02] and so it's the same way today is you
[32:05] know people want to want to point to
[32:07] different things and who they are and
[32:09] and these things and not realizing you
[32:11] know when to see what god has done in
[32:13] our day and they begin to dispute and
[32:16] argue and fuss about it
[32:20] it's a
[32:21] it's a terrible thing but
[32:25] but as brother branham
[32:26] said the holy ghost
[32:30] when the holy ghost came
[32:32] he said he said you'll be witnesses unto
[32:33] me and he said because the holy ghost is
[32:36] the witness
[32:37] and as you know as you as you go through
[32:39] then as the witness comes then it you
[32:42] know it quickens the word that you've
[32:44] hailed
[32:45] and if the word has been quickened in
[32:47] you then the word that has become and
[32:49] it's not just a uh
[32:52] just an idea or a thought
[32:54] but it's actually a life
[32:57] and so you know it's it's no longer as
[32:59] paul said it's no longer i that live now
[33:01] he said but it's christ that liveth in
[33:03] me and so it's not it's not just
[33:05] something that is uh to give us
[33:09] ideas and and new thoughts and
[33:11] everything like that but it's a
[33:12] life-changing experience
[33:14] and so when this life comes in then it's
[33:16] a life changing that because that life
[33:18] is to be made manifest and it's supposed
[33:20] to be an expression and so you know as
[33:23] as when they begin to see jesus when
[33:25] when the when the disciples began to
[33:28] receive the holy ghost and they began to
[33:29] walk in the word that they had held and
[33:31] and it was quickened to them then the
[33:33] life that they began to express into the
[33:36] people then they began to notice and
[33:38] they said they were called christians
[33:40] why because they because they began to
[33:42] identify christ in them and you know
[33:44] it's the same thing today brothers and
[33:46] sisters it has not ever changed and so
[33:48] when when people see us when people see
[33:51] the you know because you say well i have
[33:53] the holy ghost living inside of me i
[33:55] have i you know i am a son or a daughter
[33:57] of god then you know if they can't see
[33:59] jesus christ in us then it's and it's a
[34:01] shame
[34:03] it's a rebuke to us that the world
[34:05] cannot see who we are
[34:09] why because you know that i love that
[34:11] little song and some of you may not know
[34:13] it but i i've sung it before and you
[34:15] know it says when the chorus goes when
[34:18] they looked they beheld him
[34:20] when i spoke they could hear him
[34:23] he said when i walked my every footstep
[34:26] led them all to calvary
[34:29] and if our lives don't match that to a t
[34:31] if we don't if people can't see jesus
[34:33] christ in us then we've failed
[34:35] that we have missed the mark why because
[34:38] everything that we say and do ought to
[34:40] be pleasing to the lord it should be a
[34:42] it should be a manifestation
[34:44] of who who god is it should be it should
[34:47] be a love letter that is written because
[34:49] if we are supposed to be
[34:50] written epistles read and known of all
[34:52] men then it should be that what they see
[34:55] is what the fullness and the essence of
[34:57] god is they ought to see the essence of
[35:00] jesus christ in each one of us not not
[35:03] just seeing not just seeing the old man
[35:05] because the old man's supposed to be
[35:07] dead now that doesn't mean that you
[35:09] don't fake the old man and you still
[35:11] don't have that that old that old nature
[35:13] trying to come back and that old thing
[35:15] trying to fight you all day and all
[35:17] night but you know the thing is is
[35:19] greater is he that's in us than he
[35:21] that's in the world we should we should
[35:24] be more than conquerors why because when
[35:26] we look to see when when he was a
[35:28] witness of what he done he said i
[35:30] conquered all things and you know
[35:32] because he said all things the scripture
[35:34] tells us that all things were placed
[35:36] under his feet then you and i then you
[35:39] and i are more than conquerors through
[35:40] him that loved us
[35:42] that if we're more than conquerors then
[35:44] all things are under our feet
[35:47] that we have overcome
[35:51] but we'll see we don't we don't we don't
[35:53] put our faith in that we don't put our
[35:55] confidence in it we don't realize who we
[35:57] are
[35:59] we don't see that we don't when we wake
[36:01] up in the morning you know we know how
[36:03] am i going to make it through the day
[36:07] you know we
[36:08] because you know many times what we
[36:10] start out today is and we get to we get
[36:12] to the the things that on our minds and
[36:14] the things that we've got to do and the
[36:16] routines that we've got to go through
[36:17] and all these things and lots of times
[36:19] we we fail to see that god is trying to
[36:21] talk to us
[36:24] you know we don't listen we don't as
[36:27] brother jewel always said you know you
[36:28] don't speak the devil's language
[36:30] you don't talk the devil's language but
[36:32] many times you know because the things
[36:34] that come our way many times it's so
[36:36] subtle and it's so slow that we miss
[36:38] what's coming our way and not realizing
[36:40] what the devil is trying to do to us
[36:45] you know we think we think that you know
[36:47] we see a fellow with a with with horns
[36:49] and a pitchfork and you know he's going
[36:51] to slide up and he's going to talk to us
[36:56] well the scripture says that he comes as
[36:58] an angel of light
[37:02] many times when we see these things that
[37:04] they begin to approach us and we see
[37:06] these things we miss that that the devil
[37:08] has tried to to attack us
[37:11] why because we don't recognize him
[37:15] you know brother bob and i we were
[37:16] talking about that a week or two ago you
[37:19] know because you know many times we
[37:21] think the devil is going to sit on our
[37:22] shoulder no it's it's the person that
[37:24] walks up to us
[37:27] you know it's it's the and sometimes
[37:29] it's it you know because and and you and
[37:31] you hate to say this but but it's true
[37:34] sometimes it's somebody that's the
[37:36] closest to you
[37:37] and even sometimes it's it's it's your
[37:40] husband or your wife or it could be a
[37:42] brother or sister
[37:46] and sometimes you know it's just like
[37:48] you know when when jesus was standing
[37:50] there and he heard peter say those
[37:53] things that was contrary to what he had
[37:55] already spoke and told him what was
[37:56] going to take place he was going to be
[37:58] crucified and that he would fall in the
[37:59] hands of sinful men all the things that
[38:01] was going to take place to him but he
[38:03] said all raised again and peter rebuked
[38:06] him for saying that
[38:08] when he was when when jesus was pointing
[38:10] back to the old testament and telling
[38:12] him exactly what they would say what
[38:13] they were going to do to the messiah and
[38:15] jesus said it's going to happen to me
[38:17] and peter rebuked him and then
[38:20] jesus told peter get thee behind me
[38:22] satan
[38:26] now you may not want to try that with
[38:28] your wife or your husband
[38:32] but you know what it's the same thing
[38:34] you've got to rebuke that right
[38:36] you don't you don't accept that but
[38:38] that's what you hear
[38:40] you know it's just like when when job
[38:42] was standing there and you know all the
[38:43] things that job had befalled and things
[38:46] had to be following him and all the
[38:47] things how they had went there the way
[38:49] that they had went in his life and his
[38:51] children had died and everything was
[38:54] lost and all the things that he was
[38:56] going through in his life and he was
[38:57] sitting on that ash heap and he was
[38:59] scraping bowls and you know then he had
[39:01] people that wanted to come to him and
[39:03] and try to comfort him and you know it's
[39:05] like when you got friends like that who
[39:06] needs enemies
[39:09] you know they come and you know they're
[39:11] as he said you know your physicians of
[39:13] no value
[39:15] but then when when his wife comes and
[39:17] begins to speak to him he said you talk
[39:19] as a foolish woman
[39:23] well job bless your heart all the things
[39:25] you've been through in your life why
[39:26] don't you just curse god and die
[39:31] and you know many people think you know
[39:33] she just come out there no i don't know
[39:35] i i don't know i wasn't there you wasn't
[39:36] there either so we don't know but you
[39:38] know
[39:39] i i just don't i just don't see i just
[39:41] don't see job walking right out there
[39:43] and yelling at him job why don't you
[39:44] curse god and die
[39:48] we're gonna why because satan's not that
[39:50] way
[39:53] satan get up there
[39:54] bless your heart job
[39:56] poor fella
[39:58] what you all do is curse god die
[40:03] just pet you
[40:06] like pet the devil
[40:09] poor fella why don't you just go ahead
[40:11] and curse god and die
[40:13] that's why that's why i see that it
[40:16] i don't know maybe i'm wrong but
[40:18] you know that's just the way he does you
[40:19] know he comes along poor pitiful you
[40:23] you know
[40:25] one for bad luck i'd have no luck at all
[40:31] brother jill said well is he well is he
[40:33] woo
[40:35] just the way it is oh poor pitiful you
[40:39] but that's not that's not the way but
[40:41] see we we can all fall into those times
[40:44] of you know living in the dumps and and
[40:47] all the melancholy things and you know
[40:50] and so somebody will say something to
[40:52] you
[40:53] and man it'll turn your day upside down
[40:57] and and you and you'll deal with that
[40:59] one thought that one idea that one thing
[41:01] it said to you that'll ruin your whole
[41:03] day because you'll sit and look
[41:05] do they mean by that
[41:08] why'd they say that why did they say it
[41:10] that way
[41:14] and it's just like you know well you
[41:15] know what
[41:16] when i get a chance that's what i'm
[41:17] gonna say
[41:22] i got my rebuttal to them
[41:24] and you and you spend all day and you
[41:27] know what then later on
[41:29] something something will happen
[41:32] and you know what none of that matters
[41:33] anymore
[41:34] yeah
[41:35] that's brother dale talking about you
[41:37] know your wife will say something to you
[41:38] and then you thought well i'ma give her
[41:40] a piece of my mind when i get home
[41:42] and then she'll meet you at the door and
[41:43] she'll say something she'll tell you
[41:44] that she loves you she'll say something
[41:46] wonderful and it's like well you just
[41:48] ruined my rebuttal
[41:50] i was ready to give you a piece of my
[41:51] mind
[41:53] but now i can't
[41:55] but you've wasted the whole day
[42:00] and other times somebody will say
[42:01] something to you and the next thing you
[42:03] know you're just looking for
[42:05] and it's and it's not something that
[42:06] somebody is trying to push your buttons
[42:08] but something is said
[42:10] and because some because something's
[42:12] already been said to you we get our
[42:14] feelings hurt we get upset about
[42:17] something the next person that says
[42:18] something to us then they're the person
[42:20] that gets unloaded on
[42:22] right
[42:23] and then we're really quick on somebody
[42:25] because something that has been said and
[42:28] it's like
[42:29] you know then it's like
[42:32] and sometimes you know we say things
[42:34] before we
[42:36] they they say you can't actually speak
[42:38] without thinking but sometimes that's
[42:40] scientifically uh
[42:42] i think i think we understand that that
[42:44] we know what we're saying but we don't
[42:45] understand the consequences of what
[42:46] we're seeing
[42:48] so when we say we don't think when we're
[42:49] we don't think it through
[42:51] is what we're actually saying
[42:54] we say what we we because we know what
[42:56] we want to say the problem is we don't
[42:57] realize what the consequences are going
[42:59] to be when you say that
[43:02] but drink many times then you have to
[43:04] step back and say you know that's not
[43:06] that's not pleasing to the lord
[43:09] and that's not that's not becoming to a
[43:11] christian
[43:13] and sometimes you know we have to
[43:14] apologize
[43:17] and sometimes sometimes when some things
[43:19] are said to you then you've got to step
[43:20] back and say well lord i don't i'm not
[43:22] i'm not going i'm not going to get into
[43:23] that
[43:26] and sometimes that's hard to do
[43:28] sometimes
[43:32] there's reason that
[43:35] he's still working on me
[43:38] to make me what ought to be
[43:40] because there's many times in our lives
[43:42] things happen that we don't we don't we
[43:44] can't control we don't know how to
[43:47] how to
[43:48] process it but it takes the lord
[43:52] to come on the scene to do that
[43:55] i was i was just this week i was i was
[43:58] speaking to a to a lady and she's she's
[44:00] went through a lot of
[44:01] hard times in her life and
[44:03] they they've moved from up north and
[44:05] they're
[44:08] they had to
[44:09] they had to move from the house that
[44:11] they were renting
[44:12] and then her her husband
[44:15] the whole family had ended up with covid
[44:17] and her husband passed away
[44:19] and then she had to have surgery and
[44:23] unfortunately the surgery didn't
[44:25] didn't turn out the way that it it
[44:26] should have
[44:28] and so she's had a lot of
[44:30] ailments because of that
[44:33] and you know just i mean when you when
[44:36] you look at somebody in all the
[44:37] situation and all the the things that
[44:39] she's been through and you know she she
[44:42] just lives in this in this constant
[44:44] state
[44:47] you know she's she's so down she's so
[44:49] out
[44:50] she has a lot of anger there's a lot of
[44:52] grief
[44:53] you know and it's understandable where
[44:55] she's coming from
[44:58] and all and all you can do is try to as
[45:00] try to share something with somebody
[45:02] when they allow you to because many
[45:04] times you just speak to them and and
[45:06] they're not they're not receptive to
[45:08] what you're going to say to them
[45:10] but you know and what what struck my
[45:13] attention was this woman and all the
[45:14] things that she's went through and all
[45:16] you can do is pray for it you know just
[45:17] like listen things will get better
[45:20] and you know it's just like listen we
[45:22] love you the lord loves you things will
[45:24] get better
[45:26] but she's she's just sewing it and and
[45:28] what's so amazing there was a as another
[45:29] lady she went through the
[45:31] other
[45:32] different circumstances but you know the
[45:34] same same thing she's lost loved ones
[45:36] and different things have happened to
[45:37] her in her her situation but you know
[45:40] what what struck me about the second
[45:42] lady was in her situation you know she
[45:44] can find the things that are positive
[45:48] so here's this lady and you know and
[45:50] what struck me was the first lady she's
[45:52] like well i only had 15 years with my
[45:54] husband
[45:55] and then he's gone
[45:57] it's like you know this is the love of
[45:58] my life and then the other lady she she
[46:00] is
[46:01] and and and it only take it you know
[46:04] some people their their makeup is
[46:06] different but sometimes i think it's the
[46:07] lord that speaks to people
[46:09] and it shows you
[46:11] to me it just speaks to me because you
[46:13] know she's like and you see other people
[46:15] that are around you it's like other
[46:17] people have lost loved ones other people
[46:19] have went through surgeries and they
[46:20] didn't work out right some people have
[46:22] you know lost houses and and all these
[46:24] different unfortunate things have
[46:26] happened in their life but you know the
[46:27] thing is is there's people who's like
[46:28] you know what i still have my health
[46:32] hey you know and she's like because she
[46:34] begins to look at other people and she's
[46:36] like you know i've had 20 years with my
[46:38] husband
[46:39] but you know
[46:40] i i thank god for the 20 years
[46:43] now this other lady she only had 15 but
[46:45] she's like i've had 20 years but she
[46:46] said you know there's other people that
[46:48] didn't have as long as we did
[46:51] and then when she talked about
[46:52] you know people have lost children it's
[46:54] like you know it's like well you know
[46:56] what these children have had had less
[46:58] time with their father and my kids have
[47:00] had longer with their father
[47:02] and then you begin to look back and you
[47:04] think man that's that's so amazing
[47:05] because even in the midst of all this
[47:07] sadness and all this grief and all these
[47:09] things then when you begin to look and
[47:12] you begin to see that how god has begun
[47:14] to speak to people and you know even in
[47:16] the midst of all their grief and then
[47:17] like like job said he said the lord hate
[47:20] the lord giveth and the lord takes away
[47:22] he said blessed be the name of the lord
[47:24] and you know what struck me is is how
[47:26] how ungrateful we can be when god begins
[47:28] to speak to us in the scripture
[47:30] and you know
[47:34] and this is you know because now it's
[47:36] the time of thanksgiving and you know we
[47:38] can become so ungrateful
[47:41] because we begin to look at ourselves
[47:43] and we look at the condition that we're
[47:45] in and you know what we felt because
[47:48] when we go back and we look at all the
[47:50] things that went that david went through
[47:51] in his life and all of the all the
[47:53] conflict and all the heartache and all
[47:55] the problems but you know he began to
[47:56] talk about the mercies of god or knew
[47:59] every morning and he began to talk about
[48:01] all the things that god had given him
[48:03] because you know what he began to speak
[48:05] from from a place because he realized
[48:08] who he was
[48:09] because when he began to realize and all
[48:11] the conflict and all the problems and
[48:13] being isolated and being cast out but
[48:15] you know what he was still the anointed
[48:17] king of god he was still anointed of god
[48:20] to do a job and all those things you
[48:23] know what god didn't turn his back on
[48:25] him everything went went sideways and
[48:27] upside down and everything like that but
[48:29] it didn't change who he was
[48:31] and you know he began to speak you know
[48:33] and all the things that god had done for
[48:35] him
[48:36] and it's the same way with you and i
[48:37] when you know many times we look and we
[48:39] say well why do things happen this way
[48:41] why does things go this way and all
[48:42] these other things but you know the
[48:43] thing is is god's still in control god
[48:46] still reigns and you know the thing is
[48:48] is whatever comes my way he allows that
[48:51] to happen he's allowed these things to
[48:53] come into my life he's allowed these
[48:55] things these heartaches and these
[48:56] problems but you know what he's made me
[48:58] an overcomer but the problem is is i can
[49:00] lay down and i can allow the devil to
[49:02] walk all over the top of me and i can
[49:04] lay down and just live in the molly
[49:06] grubs where i can stand up and say i'm a
[49:08] son of god and you know what i've been
[49:09] blessed and i'm going to overcome and
[49:12] whether whether i go down i'm going to
[49:13] go down fighting i'm not going to back
[49:16] up i'm not going to quit because it gets
[49:18] hard
[49:19] i'm not quitting why because he never
[49:21] quit on me and i'm not quitting on him
[49:27] i'm not giving up i'm not quitting i'm
[49:29] not stopping
[49:31] why because he's he's made me an
[49:33] overcomer but the problem is is see we
[49:35] can we not realizing who we are that
[49:37] we've been called to this position we've
[49:39] been called to this and that's why it's
[49:41] going to get harder and harder but guess
[49:43] what greater is he that's in us than he
[49:46] that's in the world we've been called to
[49:48] be a conqueror in this hour
[49:54] there's there's many things that when
[49:56] you
[49:57] look at looking in and even in the
[49:59] psalms and and
[50:01] psalms i believe it's 137 there
[50:05] and
[50:08] oh
[50:10] david speaking of them going into
[50:12] babylon
[50:13] they said we've been taking when they
[50:15] begin to be took it taken into captivity
[50:18] and he said you know he said as we were
[50:20] led in and he said we hung up our uh
[50:22] harps on the trees and he said then he
[50:25] he said he said and they began to ask of
[50:27] us
[50:28] he said they asked of us of mirth
[50:30] and the songs of zion
[50:33] and he said he said how can we sing in a
[50:35] strange land
[50:37] and all of a sudden you know hear that
[50:39] he began to look back and say how can we
[50:41] sing these songs whenever things went
[50:43] against us how how can we sing the songs
[50:45] of zion but you know what he began to
[50:47] think about zion and began to look back
[50:49] at those things and he said he said he
[50:51] said if i forget zion if i forget he
[50:54] said then let my hand my
[50:56] hand lose its cunning
[50:58] he said he said let my tongue cleave to
[51:00] the roof of my mouth he said if that's
[51:02] not my well my
[51:03] best joy my chief joy
[51:06] what what amazing thing that even in the
[51:09] midst of all those things but you know
[51:10] he began to look at the captivity and
[51:13] all the things around him and you know
[51:14] he said how can we sing these songs but
[51:16] later on in the chapter if you drop down
[51:18] then it says old child children or
[51:20] daughter of zio of babylon he said he
[51:23] said would you soon come to your
[51:25] destruction
[51:27] then all of a sudden then you know he
[51:29] begins to look at how can i live how can
[51:32] i rejoice in this time how can i go
[51:34] through all of this but then he began to
[51:35] realize you know what i'm only here for
[51:37] a little while why because in that same
[51:39] chapter in the midst of all that god
[51:41] began to speak to them they were coming
[51:43] out of captivity
[51:44] so they were coming out so they might
[51:46] have been going in but you know what god
[51:48] had spoken to that they were coming out
[51:50] and you know your brothers and sisters
[51:52] we may live in a world that's falling
[51:54] apart but guess what our captivity will
[51:56] soon be over with we soon will be
[51:58] leaving this place we've already been
[52:01] promised a trip out of here we've
[52:03] already got a way that's made that's
[52:04] going to be and say brothers and sisters
[52:06] the word has come to us to realize and
[52:09] say how can we sing the songs of zion in
[52:12] a strange land yes we're in a strange
[52:14] land yes we're in a strange place but i
[52:16] can tell you i can sing the songs of
[52:17] zion when i begin to think about the
[52:19] goodness of god what god has done for me
[52:21] and you know what i'm getting out of
[52:23] here there is a way that's been made an
[52:25] escape to get out of here
[52:27] so when god has called us when we're
[52:29] leaving then i can sing the songs of
[52:31] zion why because i've been made more
[52:33] than a conqueror
[52:36] amen
[52:40] it's so wonderful
[52:42] to realize who we are and what god has
[52:44] called us to
[52:48] so
[52:49] you know what we we've heard
[52:53] the what the what the things that the
[52:55] devil has told us
[52:57] and we've heard the things that god has
[52:59] told us
[53:01] like like i told her last time you know
[53:04] when we talk about political parties and
[53:06] brother brown said that
[53:08] he said jesus voted for me and he said
[53:09] the devil voted against me and he said i
[53:11] voted with jesus
[53:14] so i'm more than a conqueror i'm a
[53:16] winner why because i voted the way that
[53:18] that's going to help me
[53:20] god has made a way for me and so you
[53:22] know it it's the way that you but you
[53:25] but we have to realize what god has done
[53:27] for us and the word and we have to
[53:29] accept that
[53:31] but we realize also that the devil is
[53:33] coming in and his and his job is to
[53:36] refute all the things of the word of god
[53:39] he's come to refute your testimony what
[53:41] god has told you his job is to
[53:43] contradict and come against that
[53:46] and so the thing is is when we realize
[53:48] like i said last time when we realized
[53:49] that that god has given us the truth and
[53:52] god what god has done for us
[53:54] and i said then then we come to the
[53:56] place and we have to take these things
[53:58] and we have to look at them
[54:00] we look at the we look at the things
[54:02] that god has done and and then we have
[54:05] to uh examine the witnesses
[54:09] we have to examine the witnesses and and
[54:11] look at look at their testimony
[54:15] and so when we when we begin to look at
[54:17] these things and then we see you know
[54:18] when we take when we take a look at what
[54:20] what god has said
[54:23] and you know when brother brandon
[54:24] preached the message the court trial
[54:26] there he wasn't he was talking about you
[54:27] know uh
[54:28] mr impatient
[54:30] and you know the in the doubter and and
[54:32] the different ones and you know he said
[54:33] you know they they come in there and
[54:35] they say well god has not done these
[54:37] things and god's not done these things
[54:40] and then you know then they begin to put
[54:42] him on on the trial
[54:45] because he the thing is god never
[54:46] promised us a time limit he never give
[54:49] us but he told us if we would hold on
[54:52] but see the many times we go back and
[54:54] look how many times have we heard from
[54:56] god and god not failed us how many times
[54:58] have you prayed and god answered your
[55:00] prayers how many times when you didn't
[55:01] even ask god for anything that he come
[55:03] on the scene and you realize that it was
[55:05] the hand of the lord that reached out
[55:07] and grabbed a hold of you and stopped
[55:09] you or whatever and guided you in the
[55:10] right direction
[55:13] so when you begin to look at the
[55:14] witnesses then you say well this is what
[55:16] god has done for me
[55:20] and all the times that god has never
[55:22] failed me
[55:25] but then on the flip side when you come
[55:26] in there and you take the same thing and
[55:28] you look to see what what the devil has
[55:30] said
[55:31] and you and you begin to take everything
[55:33] that the devil has said to you
[55:37] and then all of a sudden then you then
[55:39] you know when as i was talking about
[55:41] last time when you when you began to
[55:43] hear the things and you think about all
[55:44] the times that the devil has told you
[55:46] things and it never come to pass
[55:49] when he's coming and he said and he's
[55:51] told you oh you're not going to overcome
[55:52] oh that that's a heart attack and all
[55:54] the other things that that's going to
[55:55] your family is not coming in and all the
[55:57] other things that that you've heard from
[55:59] him where he's got in your way and it's
[56:01] you know and it's not just him sitting
[56:02] on your shoulder talking in your ear but
[56:04] it's somebody coming up and and telling
[56:06] you things and coming right and even
[56:08] when people come and stand
[56:10] just toe-to-toe with you to rebuke you
[56:15] and no and knowing where you stand
[56:19] and god and god never failed you but you
[56:21] know all the times
[56:23] we see all the times that satan is
[56:24] coming and we've heard satan come and
[56:26] tell us all these things and you're not
[56:28] going to make it you're not you're not a
[56:29] son of god and all the other pro you
[56:31] know all the things that they've done
[56:32] and you know all these different things
[56:35] and it not ever come to pass
[56:38] you know and so if we only see it one
[56:41] time where we've seen one time where the
[56:42] devil has lied to us
[56:44] and we called it when we saw the devil
[56:46] had lied to us then why in the world do
[56:48] we waste any time any any bit of time
[56:50] listen to him any other time
[56:54] we get we get caught we get called in in
[56:56] this little thing where and i i don't
[56:58] know about y'all but i i we have we have
[57:01] our we have our discussions and battles
[57:02] in the truck
[57:05] we have a we have a drive time battle
[57:08] it's whenever you get along by
[57:09] yourselves usually when i'm driving and
[57:12] that's when the devil wants to talk to
[57:13] you
[57:15] and you know then it's all the things
[57:17] that went on and all the problems and
[57:20] all these different things and it's like
[57:21] you know
[57:22] and you know what then he he tires up
[57:24] your commute to work
[57:26] listening and it's like you know what
[57:28] you know you don't you don't put
[57:29] anything it's like no that's what that's
[57:31] what we're going to do we're going we're
[57:32] going to turn on the word of god and all
[57:34] of a sudden when it gets to the point
[57:35] that you know turn on some music or you
[57:38] turn on brother branham and you start
[57:39] listening to things that brother branham
[57:41] had you know just start playing the
[57:42] sermons and and things all of a sudden
[57:44] then all of a sudden it starts to get
[57:45] rid of all those things and you start to
[57:47] begin to and or you have to sit down and
[57:49] you think well you know what i'm going
[57:50] to thank god because you know what i got
[57:51] up this morning
[57:53] i can still see
[57:55] i can still walk
[57:57] and so you begin to say you know when
[57:58] you when you start to think about all
[58:00] your blessings and you count all your
[58:02] blessings as they say you know if you
[58:04] sit down and count all your blessings
[58:06] you realize that your blessings
[58:07] outnumber your troubles every time
[58:09] anytime you sit down and start counting
[58:11] all you all the good things that you got
[58:13] in your life and all your problems guess
[58:14] what then all of a sudden when you run
[58:16] out of problems and you're trying to
[58:17] find more problems to think about you
[58:19] know what you still got more goodness
[58:20] and more things of the blessings of god
[58:22] to still be counting on and so you keep
[58:24] counting the blessings and you realize
[58:26] you know what they out count outnumber
[58:27] your troubles every time and so all of a
[58:29] sudden you begin to realize hey you know
[58:31] how blessed i am
[58:33] then you're you know but we will sit and
[58:35] we will take what things what people
[58:37] will say to us
[58:39] and we will listen to what the devil has
[58:41] to say to us but you know what the devil
[58:43] is a liar and he's the father of it and
[58:45] he has so so as as we understand that he
[58:49] then he is an impeached witness
[58:52] he has no credibility he has has nothing
[58:55] to stand on his has no foundation but we
[58:58] will still listen to what he has to say
[59:01] we will still listen to one and then
[59:03] he's like well was that true
[59:06] no no no no no no no no we don't we
[59:08] don't give him any foothold
[59:11] resist the devil and he'll flee from him
[59:15] but do we put faith in our confidence
[59:18] are we totally sold out to what god has
[59:20] said
[59:24] do we fully believe
[59:27] what god has told us
[59:30] you know because the the thing that that
[59:32] grips man
[59:34] is a fear of the unknown
[59:38] and so when when we don't we
[59:40] can't figure things out
[59:44] so it you know we we begin that we begin
[59:46] to have this internal struggle with
[59:48] these things
[59:51] but you know when we again begin to look
[59:54] at what god has done for us
[59:57] when you when you when you begin to
[59:59] think
[1:00:00] brother graham said you know you think
[1:00:02] everything that that's in existence came
[1:00:05] from god is the spoken word
[1:00:08] he said you know he said even the
[1:00:10] concrete oh you know talking about all
[1:00:11] these different things the world all
[1:00:12] these things you are you are spoken word
[1:00:16] of god
[1:00:18] because god spoke
[1:00:20] man into existence
[1:00:23] but he also but he also knew who was
[1:00:25] going to be here
[1:00:27] and he knew all of his children
[1:00:29] the back part of god's mind he knew all
[1:00:31] these things was going to take place he
[1:00:32] knew
[1:00:34] he knew what the fall was going to take
[1:00:35] place
[1:00:36] he knew all these things were going to
[1:00:38] take place he knew that you'd be sitting
[1:00:40] here tonight
[1:00:43] and so all the things that that we've
[1:00:44] been through and you know what because
[1:00:46] god knew that all these things was going
[1:00:48] to take place and that man would fall
[1:00:50] you know before before the fall took
[1:00:52] place there was a lamb slain before the
[1:00:54] foundation of the world
[1:00:56] there was a way made
[1:00:58] do you know before all these things come
[1:01:00] into existence god saw you as an
[1:01:02] overcomer
[1:01:03] that's what what job said he said he saw
[1:01:05] them he said you know where were you job
[1:01:07] when when the sons of god shouted for
[1:01:09] joy
[1:01:10] the morning star was saying together and
[1:01:11] sons of god shouted for joy where where
[1:01:13] were you job
[1:01:15] where where were you in all these things
[1:01:17] when god knew you from the beginning and
[1:01:19] knew what was going to take place
[1:01:21] and he made a way for you all the way
[1:01:23] through
[1:01:25] and when when all these things were
[1:01:26] going to take place he knew exactly how
[1:01:28] you were going to look
[1:01:31] so when when he began to know how your
[1:01:33] physical body would look that he would
[1:01:35] come and that he would make
[1:01:37] you know
[1:01:39] your great-great-great-grandmother and
[1:01:40] great-great-great-grandfather and all of
[1:01:42] them would come together and this one
[1:01:43] would meet this one and this one would
[1:01:45] have children and all the things that
[1:01:46] had to come through
[1:01:49] amen
[1:01:50] and all these things they'll come all
[1:01:52] the way down for you to come here
[1:01:54] to look the way that you do
[1:01:58] and he knew that all the things and not
[1:01:59] only that not only that he would come
[1:02:02] that you would look the way that you do
[1:02:03] but you know that in his mind he
[1:02:06] actually knew that you would come here
[1:02:07] and he would know what kind of temper
[1:02:09] you would have he didn't understand your
[1:02:10] personality your mood he'd understand
[1:02:12] all these things he knew your likes and
[1:02:14] your dislikes all the things that are
[1:02:16] quirky about you that you think's
[1:02:18] different unique he knew all those
[1:02:20] different things that make you who you
[1:02:22] are
[1:02:23] and you know what he made a way for you
[1:02:26] that one day wherever you were at
[1:02:30] whether you were born in a in a family
[1:02:32] that that knew about the message all of
[1:02:34] your life
[1:02:37] or you or you never or you're the only
[1:02:38] one in the family that believes the
[1:02:40] message god knew where you were at and
[1:02:42] knew how to reach you and knew that the
[1:02:44] word would cross your path why because
[1:02:47] because you were
[1:02:52] you were predestinated
[1:02:55] you had representation
[1:02:57] so he knew where you were going to be at
[1:03:00] and he brought you and then so
[1:03:02] if you if you've come this way and you
[1:03:04] say well you know i know what i know
[1:03:06] what i used to be
[1:03:08] and i know what i am today
[1:03:10] and they say i know i know what
[1:03:12] justification is
[1:03:14] i know what sanctification is
[1:03:16] i know what the baptism of the holy
[1:03:17] ghost is i know what the indwelling of
[1:03:19] the holy ghost is and if you come all of
[1:03:21] that way and you've seen god bring you
[1:03:23] all the way through all of those things
[1:03:25] and all the things and all of the the
[1:03:28] problems that you've had to overcome and
[1:03:30] face and and god knows what what the
[1:03:33] what they call the grab bag of life all
[1:03:35] the things that you that you have to
[1:03:36] deal with here in this world and you
[1:03:38] know all the sicknesses and all these
[1:03:40] other ailments that you have to deal
[1:03:42] with that nobody you know not everybody
[1:03:43] has to face but you do
[1:03:47] but you know all of those things god
[1:03:48] knew but you know god brought you to
[1:03:50] this place
[1:03:53] and he's given you a avenue and a way to
[1:03:56] overcome and he and he's brought you
[1:03:57] this way and when you look back and you
[1:03:59] see all the things that god has done for
[1:04:01] you and you and you begin then how can
[1:04:03] you not just stand up and praise god and
[1:04:05] say thank thank you lord for what you've
[1:04:07] done for me when you when you've brought
[1:04:09] me this far and you know what i've seen
[1:04:11] i've seen the devil come in like a flood
[1:04:13] in my life but i've seen you raise up a
[1:04:15] standard against him i've seen him come
[1:04:17] in and i've seen what it didn't look
[1:04:19] like there was no way but i've seen him
[1:04:21] you make a way
[1:04:23] i've seen you come in i've said i've
[1:04:25] seen i've seen it when it didn't look
[1:04:26] like how it's like how how's this going
[1:04:28] to work out or anything like that but
[1:04:30] you know what god's come in and he's oh
[1:04:32] and he showed you away and that you've
[1:04:34] overcome when the doctor gives you a bad
[1:04:36] health report and says you can't make it
[1:04:38] and all these type things and all these
[1:04:40] things and you're excited saying you
[1:04:41] know you know what you're healthy
[1:04:43] perfect well and you know the devil
[1:04:45] can't take your kneecaps and and all
[1:04:47] kinds of other things that's happened to
[1:04:49] you why would you when you've seen when
[1:04:50] you've come down that road and you've
[1:04:52] seen all those things take place
[1:04:56] you know everywhere i go i always like
[1:04:58] to get my testimony brother luis and i
[1:05:00] were talking about that
[1:05:01] and y'all prayed for him he's he's still
[1:05:03] got that broken finger we believe that
[1:05:05] thing's going
[1:05:06] gonna heal up and it won't be no more
[1:05:08] problems bro louise
[1:05:11] he said he said he said if the lord can
[1:05:12] heal your elbow brother and he said a
[1:05:14] finger is not a problem
[1:05:21] but you know
[1:05:24] yeah i thank god all the time for my
[1:05:26] elbow
[1:05:28] you know when i when i went through all
[1:05:29] that
[1:05:32] and i went seeing that when i done that
[1:05:34] impairment rating on me that that
[1:05:37] physical therapist when they done that
[1:05:38] test on me they said you only lost three
[1:05:40] percent use in that i said well i ain't
[1:05:42] miss those three percent
[1:05:49] i can't i can't i can get that one there
[1:05:51] but i can't get that one there
[1:05:53] but that's what i used to do when i when
[1:05:54] i used to go to therapy they always
[1:05:56] laughed on me all the time i'd work out
[1:05:57] and then i'd pull them arms down
[1:06:00] that's how i stretch it more trying to
[1:06:01] get that thing
[1:06:03] look you're not going to beat me
[1:06:07] just like dr davis you know my surgeon
[1:06:09] you know he told he told me he said you
[1:06:10] know i like to think that we're that i'm
[1:06:12] good but he said we had divine
[1:06:14] intervention
[1:06:18] when i didn't have any nerve damage in
[1:06:19] that elbow
[1:06:22] well i didn't have anything
[1:06:25] that was that was god but you see you
[1:06:27] know when you see god leading you all
[1:06:29] the way
[1:06:31] that he let that he put he put the right
[1:06:33] surgeon
[1:06:35] gave me the right surgeon they brought
[1:06:36] me to the right person
[1:06:39] and i asked dr david i asked him i said
[1:06:41] do you believe in divine healing yes
[1:06:44] i said that's my kind of surgeon
[1:06:48] you believe if you're if you believe in
[1:06:49] god touching people yes i do well and
[1:06:51] you know that's the kind of doctor i
[1:06:53] want i want somebody believing that you
[1:06:54] know that god can do things
[1:06:57] god's a super in the supernatural
[1:06:59] business
[1:07:01] we do our part just like brother said
[1:07:02] you know you can mend the bone you set
[1:07:04] it and do all kinds of things you can
[1:07:06] pull a tooth but it takes god to do the
[1:07:08] healing that's right
[1:07:10] but you all thank god i i tell everybody
[1:07:15] that
[1:07:16] physical therapists when she done my
[1:07:18] impairment rating i showed her my x-rays
[1:07:21] all that all that metal in my elbow that
[1:07:23] i had
[1:07:25] and she didn't believe i was the same
[1:07:26] person
[1:07:30] and you know there was other people dr
[1:07:31] davis told me those other people had had
[1:07:33] the same surgery i did
[1:07:34] and they never got
[1:07:36] nowhere near the use out of their arm
[1:07:38] and people never they were able to use
[1:07:40] their arm
[1:07:44] and i get up every morning
[1:07:47] and sometimes i you know sometimes you
[1:07:49] get so wrapped up in things and you get
[1:07:50] upset
[1:07:54] it's like
[1:07:55] food devil
[1:07:56] what do you think about that
[1:08:01] you know
[1:08:02] i am i'm healed i'm whole
[1:08:07] and you know you you just can't you and
[1:08:09] so you know the devil the devil don't
[1:08:10] want to hang around when you start
[1:08:11] praising god
[1:08:12] when you when you start talking about
[1:08:13] all the things that god's done for you
[1:08:17] when you're when you when you've seen
[1:08:18] when you've seen your children wayward
[1:08:20] and and and lost and all of a sudden you
[1:08:22] keep you keep holding the token over
[1:08:24] them and all of a sudden then they come
[1:08:25] in and and you know then they're living
[1:08:27] a christian life and they're filled with
[1:08:29] the holy ghost and you can say
[1:08:31] devil
[1:08:34] well we don't we don't give up on them
[1:08:37] he's done it for one it's he said if you
[1:08:39] meet the same conditions he said he said
[1:08:41] you meet one and that's met that
[1:08:43] condition he said he said god's
[1:08:45] obligated to meet if you make that same
[1:08:47] condition god's obligated to do the
[1:08:49] exact same thing
[1:08:53] well i've seen god i've seen god work in
[1:08:55] my life
[1:08:57] and you know what i'm not giving up on
[1:08:58] anybody else
[1:09:02] why because god called us to be a
[1:09:03] witness
[1:09:06] and see so we you know if you can find
[1:09:09] one place where god where where has god
[1:09:11] ever failed
[1:09:12] god's never failed me
[1:09:15] but then you know i then i can put my
[1:09:17] trust and my confidence in him
[1:09:20] amen
[1:09:21] then then when we see what god has done
[1:09:24] for us and what god has brought to us
[1:09:27] then
[1:09:28] then the other thing that we have to
[1:09:30] take a stretch sometimes we don't we
[1:09:32] don't realize that when when he said
[1:09:34] when he began to speak of adam and eve
[1:09:36] being in the garden being the type of
[1:09:37] the bride and he began to speak of the
[1:09:39] bride in christ and he said he said
[1:09:41] she's born of his bone and flesh of his
[1:09:44] flesh and spirit of his spirit and life
[1:09:47] of his life then then he began to speak
[1:09:49] of who she was
[1:09:51] then you know what then then he said he
[1:09:53] said how can the word deny the word
[1:09:56] how can the word deny the word when you
[1:09:58] are the word by by the spirit so when
[1:10:00] you're born if he was the word
[1:10:02] if he is the word
[1:10:04] and you're born of the word
[1:10:06] because that is that is what is
[1:10:08] quickened then you're born of the word
[1:10:10] then you are the same thing that he is
[1:10:12] because he said she is him so then then
[1:10:15] if you're born of him then he was when
[1:10:17] he rose again brother and said when when
[1:10:18] jesus rose from the dead
[1:10:21] he said he had the mechanics but he
[1:10:22] proved that he had the dynamics by
[1:10:24] proving and overcoming death
[1:10:27] then you know what brothers and sisters
[1:10:29] if you have the same thing then you know
[1:10:31] what then you have the dynamics also he
[1:10:33] said well she is waiting for the
[1:10:34] dynamics see the thing is the dynamics
[1:10:36] because everything that you have need of
[1:10:38] was given to you in this earthly journey
[1:10:40] in the new birth
[1:10:42] she's waiting on the she's waiting on
[1:10:44] the dynamics why because the dynamics is
[1:10:46] here
[1:10:47] the dynamics is in you but you've got to
[1:10:49] recognize what you have
[1:10:51] he may tell well you know then you know
[1:10:53] sometimes that draws us back to not
[1:10:55] really no we have to realize who we are
[1:10:57] if if we if we were alienated from god
[1:11:01] if we if we were outcasts of god and he
[1:11:04] made a way back and he brought us back
[1:11:06] to him that we are born of him then what
[1:11:09] does that make us
[1:11:11] that doesn't make us any lower it
[1:11:12] doesn't make us any less
[1:11:15] then guess what god that god has made us
[1:11:17] a child of god
[1:11:19] then that we know who we are that we
[1:11:21] don't the scripture is not just just not
[1:11:24] words
[1:11:26] but it's true that's a reality
[1:11:29] so so when he said he said don't when
[1:11:30] you're heirs of god and joint heirs with
[1:11:32] christ that doesn't doesn't you know
[1:11:34] doesn't lose something
[1:11:38] well we're we're joiners well he's got
[1:11:40] he's got the majority of it and we got
[1:11:42] this little piece over here
[1:11:47] now if if richard and i we had we had
[1:11:50] that kind of joint in our family
[1:11:53] we'd have we'd have we'd have a
[1:11:54] disagreement
[1:11:57] you know what cause i'm gonna get mine
[1:12:05] what was that
[1:12:09] but you know
[1:12:10] you know but that's what god has told us
[1:12:13] who we are
[1:12:17] whatever
[1:12:22] but you know i because if that's who i
[1:12:24] am
[1:12:25] then then i've got janine's back here
[1:12:27] too so
[1:12:30] oh james back there
[1:12:32] but i come together i'm coming to get
[1:12:34] mine
[1:12:37] you know and and so you know when we
[1:12:39] when we stand up and we say well we're
[1:12:41] we're heirs of god and join heirs with
[1:12:43] christ with him that what does that mean
[1:12:47] well then we say in
[1:12:48] there lord please help me lord lord i
[1:12:53] need this i need that
[1:12:55] i need healing
[1:12:59] it is begging plead
[1:13:01] big and pleading
[1:13:04] you know
[1:13:04] when i i realized years ago
[1:13:08] every time i pray for somebody i always
[1:13:10] always like to you know you you can pray
[1:13:12] over somebody and you know you ask but
[1:13:14] the last thing i like to do i like to
[1:13:16] thank god for it right one because
[1:13:18] brother brother abraham said that that
[1:13:19] if jesus christ was standing right here
[1:13:22] in front of you right now he couldn't do
[1:13:24] any more than what he's already done for
[1:13:26] you
[1:13:27] he couldn't he couldn't heal you
[1:13:29] he said because it's already it's he's
[1:13:31] already done it
[1:13:32] he couldn't save you because he's
[1:13:33] already done it
[1:13:35] it's already a finished work
[1:13:37] it's a finished work of calvary
[1:13:40] he said by his strikes you were healed
[1:13:43] it's not so it's it's not that i have to
[1:13:45] come up there and plead and pray and beg
[1:13:48] god for healing
[1:13:51] no brother brahman said the faith was a
[1:13:54] long-range vision
[1:13:55] that's right so then when i see you see
[1:13:57] what he said then i'm going to step out
[1:13:59] and say well thank you lord because
[1:14:00] that's what i do when when you pray over
[1:14:02] somebody and say thank you lord because
[1:14:04] you know what it's the finished work of
[1:14:05] calvary
[1:14:06] it's finished
[1:14:08] it's already done it he's already he's
[1:14:10] done all that he can do
[1:14:12] then the problem is is it becomes ours
[1:14:14] then it's our responsibility to believe
[1:14:17] that and walk in it
[1:14:18] then we set up every day you know what
[1:14:20] i'm healed
[1:14:21] i ca i can't be anymore i can't be any
[1:14:23] more healed
[1:14:25] than i already
[1:14:26] am right
[1:14:28] just just like just like saying you know
[1:14:29] i i'm going to be saved you can't get
[1:14:31] any more saved
[1:14:33] if you if you're already saved then you
[1:14:35] can't be getting any more saved
[1:14:37] if you if you're already if you're
[1:14:39] already justified and sanctified and
[1:14:40] filled with the holy ghost you can't get
[1:14:42] any more
[1:14:44] why because he's already put you in the
[1:14:45] body so there's i mean that's that's
[1:14:47] where you that's where you're sealed
[1:14:49] until the day of your redemption you
[1:14:51] can't get any more sealed
[1:14:53] now you can grow in more in god but you
[1:14:55] can't get any more sealed because you
[1:14:57] can't get any more in the into the whole
[1:14:59] into the kingdom of god because you're
[1:15:00] already in there
[1:15:02] so we can't we can't become any more
[1:15:05] we can grow
[1:15:07] just like when a child's born they can't
[1:15:09] get any more borne
[1:15:12] they're here
[1:15:16] but then it takes a growth development
[1:15:18] right absolutely that's right
[1:15:20] so when we see who we are then we we've
[1:15:22] gotten to this place and what god has
[1:15:24] done for us then this is where we are
[1:15:28] what god has done for us and then we can
[1:15:29] set up and say all these things every
[1:15:31] promise in the book is mine
[1:15:34] then i'm not then i'm not waiting on god
[1:15:37] well lord are you going to bless me with
[1:15:38] this or no he's already blessed you
[1:15:42] because he said you know because even
[1:15:43] our mind is it's greater than what our
[1:15:45] minds can comprehend what god has done
[1:15:47] for us what god has blessed us but you
[1:15:49] know we the brotherhood said we live so
[1:15:51] far below our privileges
[1:15:53] but you know then and then we come as to
[1:15:55] speak as a witness
[1:15:58] so many times when people stand up and
[1:16:00] you know because how many times has
[1:16:02] people got up to testify about what god
[1:16:05] has done for them and when people get
[1:16:06] shocked
[1:16:10] you know what i i prayed for healing we
[1:16:12] all prayed and then somebody got healed
[1:16:14] and they act like they're gonna fall on
[1:16:15] the floor like
[1:16:16] wow
[1:16:19] i mean you really or i mean because
[1:16:21] something we don't realize god that's
[1:16:23] what god does he's and that's what he
[1:16:24] said he would do
[1:16:26] he said that he would heal you
[1:16:28] you're already healed so when it comes
[1:16:29] to passage shouldn't shock us
[1:16:33] yeah but brother said he said it should
[1:16:35] shock us when it doesn't come to pass
[1:16:38] when people are standing in the pool in
[1:16:39] the in the church and he said he said
[1:16:41] that all of a sudden he said when people
[1:16:42] are not getting healed when people are
[1:16:44] not getting what their their answers
[1:16:45] when their god being delivered he said
[1:16:47] then it's a time to stop
[1:16:50] just like the children of israel when
[1:16:51] when the sin was in the camp then it was
[1:16:53] time to stop
[1:16:55] and see what was taking place
[1:16:58] brothers and sisters that's what god
[1:17:00] wants us to do
[1:17:03] you know it doesn't it doesn't make us
[1:17:05] arrogant
[1:17:06] it doesn't puff us up
[1:17:09] but you know what it makes us want to
[1:17:11] walk in what god has called us to
[1:17:13] to walk in what god has given us not not
[1:17:16] to be arrogant because that's not god's
[1:17:19] way
[1:17:20] but to be confident in what god has
[1:17:22] given us what god has called us to
[1:17:24] god has called us and i don't have i
[1:17:27] don't have to worry about what the devil
[1:17:29] says because the devil's a liar and he's
[1:17:30] the father of it and you know there
[1:17:32] ain't never there's no any time he's
[1:17:33] ever come
[1:17:37] just like they say about a politician
[1:17:38] how do you know that they're lying
[1:17:42] their mouth's moving they're talking to
[1:17:43] you well how do you know the devil's
[1:17:45] lying to you
[1:17:48] as soon as he starts talking to you
[1:17:49] that's when you know the devil's lying
[1:17:51] right
[1:17:53] he ain't never going he never told the
[1:17:55] truth ain't never gonna tell the truth
[1:17:58] but he wants you to but he wants you to
[1:18:00] stop and listen to him
[1:18:02] just like eve
[1:18:05] stop and get out
[1:18:07] and not be fortified behind the word
[1:18:10] not to be fortified behind the word
[1:18:14] but that as the as the quote that i read
[1:18:17] the other sunday about oneness
[1:18:20] you know
[1:18:21] you grab ahold of that sword
[1:18:24] and say lord by this i'm going to cut
[1:18:26] every doubt away
[1:18:28] amen i'm going to stand raise my hand
[1:18:30] say lord by this i'm going to overcome
[1:18:32] i'm oneness with you
[1:18:36] that's what god has called us to he's
[1:18:38] given us the weapon
[1:18:40] the way to overcome he's made us more
[1:18:42] than conquerors through him
[1:18:45] let's all stand this evening how the
[1:18:47] musicians come god has made a way for us
[1:18:50] and you are more than a conqueror
[1:18:51] through him
[1:18:58] god has called us
[1:18:59] to be a witness
[1:19:02] to the world
[1:19:04] that he still lives
[1:19:10] that it's he's the same yesterday today
[1:19:12] and forever
[1:19:14] what the what the word says what this
[1:19:16] bible says is the truth
[1:19:21] why because there's somebody that lives
[1:19:23] it
[1:19:24] that it's made known
[1:19:27] he said well i don't you know i just
[1:19:28] don't see how people can live that way
[1:19:31] well the thing is it's not us living
[1:19:34] when you when you get when you get the
[1:19:36] holy ghost
[1:19:37] when you get the one on the inside that
[1:19:39] lives a life it's not you living the
[1:19:41] life it's him living the life
[1:19:44] i love when brother brown said you know
[1:19:45] when they asked him said well did you
[1:19:46] keep when your wife died
[1:19:48] and your daughter died and all these
[1:19:49] things said did you keep your religion
[1:19:51] he said no it kept me
[1:19:54] see the thing is it's not it's not us
[1:19:56] trying to live the life it's letting him
[1:19:58] live
[1:19:59] it's no longer i that live now
[1:20:01] but christ that lives in me amen amen
[1:20:04] god bless you tonight for the border 596
[1:20:06] i feel the poor amen
[1:20:11] at night
[1:20:14] and i begin to cry
[1:20:20] and my mind just fails to know
[1:20:26] the ragley why
[1:20:30] [Music]
[1:20:38] the spirit's
[1:20:40] groaning deep within
[1:20:45] it must be god
[1:20:48] here in my soul
[1:20:50] cause i feel
[1:20:56] i feel the poor
[1:21:07] [Music]
[1:21:12] moving me
[1:21:14] to give my all
[1:21:21] he speaks to me
[1:21:26] and i
[1:21:28] agree
[1:21:33] lord please come and take control
[1:21:39] i feel the
[1:21:43] [Music]
[1:21:52] and
[1:21:57] he was
[1:21:59] drawing me
[1:22:01] to
[1:22:02] [Music]
[1:22:09] there's live day
[1:22:12] called to the deep like a great
[1:22:16] magnet pulling me
[1:22:20] i know for sure that i reach the goal
[1:22:26] cause i
[1:22:31] feel i feel
[1:22:38] i
[1:22:39] hear
[1:22:40] the call
