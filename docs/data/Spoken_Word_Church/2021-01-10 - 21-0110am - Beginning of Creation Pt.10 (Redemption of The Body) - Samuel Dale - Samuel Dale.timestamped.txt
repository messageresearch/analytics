[4:27] lady of sin is right
[4:29] these things saith the amen the faithful
[4:31] and true witness
[4:33] the beginning of the creation of god
[4:35] okay let's go to
[4:42] 10 is five wait a minute
[4:45] i gotta get over i'm in one
[4:52] i don't know where everybody gets that
[4:53] i'm in one one and then there's that
[4:56] called it two
[4:57] you know doing but that's all right
[5:00] verse
[5:02] 16.
[5:08] well
[5:12] yeah here we go wherefore
[5:16] henceforth know we no man after the
[5:18] flesh
[5:20] yeah though we have known christ after
[5:22] the flesh
[5:23] yet now henceforth know we him no more
[5:27] i'm glad of that aren't you because it
[5:29] wouldn't matter if we did know him in
[5:30] the flesh that's fine
[5:32] but now to knowing that the way that the
[5:34] scripture is talking about him
[5:36] in the new birth therefore if any man be
[5:38] in christ he is a new create
[5:40] creature old things are passed away
[5:43] behold
[5:43] all things are become new and all things
[5:47] are of god who has reconciled
[5:50] us to himself by jesus christ and have
[5:53] given to us the ministry of
[5:55] reconciliation
[5:57] to wit now we got remember we got
[5:59] another two we got one in romans
[6:02] to understand that god was in christ
[6:05] reconciling the world unto himself
[6:08] not imputing their trespasses unto them
[6:11] and have committed unto us the word
[6:14] of reconciliation you may be seated lord
[6:17] that is blessing to the reading of the
[6:19] word
[6:20] now i want to try if i can to
[6:24] back up and just run through real fights
[6:26] and
[6:27] bring this part that we're talking about
[6:31] uh to to end and then we'll pick up some
[6:35] things along the way that we'll try to
[6:38] go into
[6:38] maybe um adoption predestinations just
[6:42] some
[6:43] some points along the way to uh
[6:46] be able to follow you know the line that
[6:49] we're doing
[6:50] all right i hope you've enjoyed what
[6:51] i've been trying to bring because
[6:54] you know to me i believe it's the
[6:56] beginning of the creation
[6:58] all right this is message number 10 that
[7:00] we're bringing and it's
[7:02] the the beginning it's you know we we
[7:05] look at it as the beginning
[7:08] and that's what i say another day we
[7:09] read revelation 3 14.
[7:12] it's the beginning of the creation but
[7:13] it's that there it is in the end of the
[7:15] book
[7:16] all right so then we're looking at the
[7:19] beginning of the creation
[7:20] all the way to the beginning of the
[7:23] creation
[7:24] of a new creation because that's what
[7:26] i've been trying to drive
[7:27] at you to just for us to see we know
[7:31] that we talk about the new creation
[7:36] all right and we've we went through it
[7:38] we went through the part of trying to
[7:40] bring
[7:41] that god himself came into being or came
[7:44] into manifestation
[7:47] or has revealed himself
[7:50] you know unto the man that he would
[7:52] create
[7:54] not leaving him in a blind spot you know
[7:57] that he wouldn't
[7:58] be doing it but he he the man that he
[8:00] was going to create
[8:03] the he starts out revealing himself
[8:07] into that creation that's back there see
[8:10] it would be a new creation
[8:12] because there was never a creation like
[8:14] that
[8:15] god himself condescending
[8:21] to earth or making himself known
[8:25] to mankind god himself now
[8:28] in that that way we have the
[8:30] understanding that we couldn't have a
[8:32] trinity
[8:33] because how would we have a trinity and
[8:35] we'd have three gods
[8:37] and trying to manifest the things so we
[8:39] know it's not it's the one true and
[8:41] living god
[8:43] that he's trying to reveal himself to
[8:46] you and me are revealing himself back
[8:48] there
[8:49] to the man that he was going to bring
[8:51] into being
[8:53] all right then to genesis 1 26 man
[8:57] 27 there that is the man that he would
[9:01] bring into being which would be the
[9:02] spirit man
[9:04] or god dividing himself
[9:08] in his people all right that's the point
[9:12] i want you to make sure to follow
[9:14] god dividing himself
[9:18] into his people he's not just
[9:21] associating with us
[9:24] he's not just coming down to be with us
[9:28] you know he could do that with the
[9:30] animals and all the kind of things like
[9:32] that
[9:32] but he's coming down to dwell with us
[9:36] all right but not to dwell with us to
[9:38] dwell in us
[9:39] so remember we spent a lot of time on
[9:42] genesis 1 26
[9:43] wade had a lot that is the spiritual
[9:46] creation
[9:48] or spirit man
[9:51] that was created but not created like
[9:54] coming into being that what but the god
[9:57] of glory is manifesting himself
[10:01] to where we can see him
[10:04] all right that's what he's wanting he's
[10:07] wanting us to see him
[10:08] all right then he's coming forth himself
[10:11] in you and me because that's the
[10:14] beginning of the creation of god
[10:17] all right is god himself manifesting
[10:19] himself to you and i
[10:21] to so that we can see it all right then
[10:23] we went from the 126
[10:25] man to a spirit man
[10:28] a spiritual creation went down to a
[10:31] physical creation
[10:32] of a human body that adam in the garden
[10:36] standing there and i've got one here
[10:38] that brother around
[10:39] said there he stood said his feet was
[10:42] standing in the earth
[10:44] he had created him physically
[10:47] right he had created adam physically
[10:50] and said he was standing with his feet
[10:52] in the in the earth
[10:54] and said then god breathed the breath of
[10:57] eternal life
[10:59] into him all right and that's where
[11:02] that i don't believe that we follow that
[11:06] uh i've emphasized it over and over and
[11:09] over
[11:11] that the man that was created in genesis
[11:15] 1 26 and 27 was not a physical
[11:18] flesh man it was spirit man or spiritual
[11:22] being
[11:23] in other words it was god in another
[11:25] form
[11:26] dividing himself among his people
[11:30] that would be his offspring that would
[11:33] be the children of god
[11:36] that would would come forth and and
[11:38] eventually make
[11:39] manifest all right but then
[11:42] he he's there in the garden
[11:46] and he's lonely because he still has
[11:49] nothing to
[11:50] fellowship in the natural flesh man all
[11:53] right so he creates
[11:55] adam genesis 2 7
[11:59] he creates adam makes him a spiritual
[12:02] you know makes him a
[12:03] a human being in a body
[12:07] 16 elements a body and he's
[12:10] he's there and then god takes that 126
[12:14] man
[12:14] puts it into the 2-7 and makes him
[12:19] to be a living soul because like i said
[12:22] the prophet said he was
[12:24] standing there he had created him he had
[12:27] molded him he had fashioned him he
[12:28] made him to be standing there and there
[12:31] he stands with his feet in the earth
[12:33] and then god breathes into his nostrils
[12:36] and he begins to move and go and do
[12:39] all right what's he doing he's making
[12:41] him he's putting this
[12:43] this spiritual man this eternal
[12:45] spiritual man
[12:47] because it would have to be the eternal
[12:49] the 126th and 27th
[12:51] or putting it into human flesh which
[12:54] would be
[12:55] the flesh man all right but it would be
[12:58] a new creation
[13:01] okay remember now how we brought it adam
[13:04] was created first
[13:06] physically and you know what i'm talking
[13:08] about and then jesus christ followed
[13:10] that
[13:11] jesus christ was not the first creation
[13:13] in the physical being
[13:15] he was the first creation in the
[13:16] spiritual being
[13:18] because he was the spiritual being he
[13:21] was the one who was back there
[13:23] and coming forth all right but then he
[13:25] brings the man forth
[13:27] and there you see adam standing in the
[13:29] garden in a wonderful position
[13:32] that inside of that human being standing
[13:35] there
[13:36] was the eternal god he had breathed into
[13:39] his nostrils blasphemous names
[13:42] he said especially into adam and i don't
[13:44] think that we want to take that
[13:47] maybe that's a wrong way of saying it
[13:50] but i don't think that we want to
[13:52] believe that to be true
[13:55] i'm just serious i don't think that we
[13:57] want to believe
[13:59] what the prophet said in blasphemous
[14:01] names
[14:03] then he said he breathed into his
[14:05] nostrils and he became
[14:07] an eternal person with god
[14:13] amen there stood adam in the garden
[14:18] spirit eternal i mean uh soul eternal
[14:22] spirit and body still not eternal
[14:26] but yet it's there it's he put into
[14:30] that man that that human body that was
[14:33] standing there
[14:33] he put that what that he had in genesis
[14:36] 1 26 and 27
[14:37] he put that into that
[14:41] and it made that and see we we don't
[14:43] want to take because we look at the fall
[14:46] we look
[14:46] we say but but but uh now but brother
[14:49] dale adam failed
[14:50] but before he failed he had an atonement
[14:54] right so everything was ready there
[14:57] wasn't
[14:58] nothing going to be out of place but
[15:00] that man that was standing there
[15:03] he's standing there just anchored in the
[15:04] earth because he was molded out of the
[15:06] earth
[15:07] or then god breathes into his nostrils
[15:10] and he becomes
[15:10] he's a living soul all right
[15:14] now that was god's way that he wanted it
[15:17] to be
[15:18] all right he wanted it to stay that way
[15:22] but remember how we covered it and
[15:23] brought it out
[15:24] let's see adam was god's way then
[15:27] of allowing to come into being a human
[15:31] body
[15:32] that would allow the fall to be able to
[15:34] take place
[15:35] i hope you followed that one that
[15:38] thought was to me was a great
[15:40] understanding as to see that in adam
[15:43] he could bring him forth and allow him
[15:46] to fall
[15:47] not make him fall he couldn't do that
[15:51] but he allowed him to fall
[15:53] to where that he could display his
[15:55] attributes and time
[15:56] all right then we took real quick
[16:00] because you've got four thousand years
[16:02] from the time of adam
[16:04] standing there in the garden
[16:07] you know even in his lost condition see
[16:10] then nobody else comes that away
[16:14] adam and eve come spirit be in first
[16:18] then into natural and then when the fall
[16:22] came it didn't take away the spirit
[16:24] being
[16:25] oh no adam and eve were still there
[16:28] because
[16:29] that's where they're standing and see
[16:30] then i noticed
[16:32] the point you know maybe it's me maybe
[16:36] it's my thought
[16:37] but when i mentioned that
[16:40] adam was a breathing human being with
[16:44] eternal life in his soul i seem to get a
[16:46] a
[16:47] backing up a little bit all right and
[16:49] also it's the same thing as to say
[16:52] that adam see that
[16:55] you kind of come up a little bit and
[16:57] talk to or listen to me
[16:59] about adam and receiving eternal life
[17:01] but
[17:02] when i say adam and eve
[17:05] that kind of backs up a little bit maybe
[17:07] it's me i'm just saying it
[17:08] maybe it's my thoughts sometimes but i
[17:11] don't think that we're really seeing
[17:13] that the way that we need to see it
[17:16] i don't think we're seeing it in the
[17:18] correct order of
[17:19] the fact that adam was created but then
[17:22] god breathed into his nostrils
[17:25] and he become a living soul but remember
[17:28] at the time that he breathed into his
[17:30] nostrils eve
[17:35] was in adam
[17:38] it's not that he breathed into adam then
[17:40] he breathed into eve
[17:43] amen that's where i think that we're not
[17:46] following that point
[17:48] to listen because eve frederick said
[17:51] was in adam in theophany
[17:55] well her being her person
[17:59] who she is she was in adam and theophany
[18:02] see we look at at what was in adam
[18:06] we look at it as uh a human flesh
[18:12] and we say well a rib was taken from
[18:14] adam and
[18:16] god made a woman he did but now what did
[18:19] that woman do
[18:22] i mean they're standing adam in the
[18:24] earth
[18:26] god breathed into his nostrils and he
[18:28] becomes a living soul
[18:30] we might be able to listen to that point
[18:32] but then when you say that
[18:34] eve had eternal life
[18:39] i seem to get a backup so all right you
[18:41] know
[18:42] i'm not trying to overwrite anything
[18:44] other than
[18:45] just try to preach it and maybe we'll
[18:48] all see it
[18:49] because see i believe that eve was in
[18:52] adam
[18:54] all right physically speaking she was
[18:57] there
[18:58] and taken physically from adam and made
[19:01] into a
[19:02] uh you know a body all right but then
[19:05] she had to have something
[19:07] and it doesn't say in the bible that he
[19:10] created eve
[19:11] and then breed into her nostrils
[19:14] no it's just talking about adam so then
[19:16] you got to bring it all back to adam
[19:18] that eve was in adam and whatever
[19:22] adam was when he separated
[19:25] the person of what not the person
[19:28] when he separated the the spiritual part
[19:32] as we call it our spirit part of the
[19:34] feminist
[19:36] woman you know separating that from adam
[19:39] remember you got to give that
[19:41] you got to give that life all right now
[19:44] there's where our
[19:45] problem that we i believe we fall back
[19:48] we say well oh
[19:50] okay i can believe that he gave eve
[19:53] life but i don't believe he gave her
[19:56] eternal life
[19:57] well where'd it come from
[20:05] if he was in adam
[20:09] then isn't it easy to fight to be able
[20:11] to put it into a point
[20:13] of to say that her spiritual being
[20:20] the theophany which the prophet called
[20:22] the soul
[20:23] hebrew series he said that was in
[20:28] he was in adam
[20:31] taken from adam and put into eternal
[20:34] life so all right now
[20:35] this gets the point of what i'm talking
[20:36] about so in the garden then when you're
[20:38] thinking about
[20:39] that god created man he created him
[20:42] first a
[20:43] spiritual being and remember he was
[20:45] created
[20:46] male and female created he him
[20:50] all right see eve was in that part of
[20:53] adam
[20:54] that adam was before the world ever
[20:56] begun
[20:59] well it's not where to come from
[21:03] then it comes down to putting that into
[21:05] flesh
[21:07] and there she stands then with eternal
[21:09] life in her soul he stands there with
[21:11] eternal life in his soul
[21:12] but yet their bodies are not eternal
[21:16] that's why the bible said that we've got
[21:18] to put them out
[21:19] lest they partake of the tree of life
[21:22] and watch
[21:23] look how perfect they were and live
[21:25] forever it didn't say live
[21:26] eternal that's right because you'd have
[21:29] an eternal sinner
[21:31] you can't do that see so it's not to
[21:34] the fact when they they've done it that
[21:36] they can't live eternally so he had to
[21:38] put them out
[21:39] lest they partake of the tree of life in
[21:41] the wrong way
[21:44] but yet what i love about it is i
[21:46] believe that those angels that was
[21:49] once protecting that tree of life
[21:52] the prophet said is now running you and
[21:55] i
[21:55] to that tree of life
[21:58] the word that we can partake of it and
[22:01] eventually our bodies will be made
[22:02] eternal i haven't got to that point
[22:05] so you know i'm wanting us to to to stay
[22:07] in it and
[22:08] when i come to this i hit this part and
[22:11] i see that well wait a minute
[22:12] it's not coming across
[22:16] so take it and think about it
[22:21] when god created man spiritual man
[22:25] spirit man that's 126-27
[22:31] then he put that
[22:34] into 2-7 in our stands
[22:38] adam with eternal life in his soul
[22:44] but his body is not eternal
[22:48] because it could not have now here
[22:50] listens to the thought
[22:52] the if it's true that
[22:56] the possibility of the fall was made
[22:59] through adam we tried to cover that
[23:02] quite a while
[23:04] i mean that the possibility
[23:08] of the fall depended on god creating
[23:11] adam
[23:12] and bringing him in a certain way that
[23:15] he could fall
[23:17] not fall to death in the basis of
[23:20] losing his eternal life right no
[23:24] and the prophet was covered in the seal
[23:25] book he said
[23:29] adam fell from eternal life to death
[23:32] you say well that's there it is helping
[23:34] me eternally well
[23:38] you ended the whole possibility of any
[23:41] uh
[23:43] point of mankind in salvation or
[23:46] whatever but he fell from
[23:49] in the bases he never reached it
[23:52] i know i'm carnal but there's a
[23:55] microphone see
[23:57] some three feet away
[24:01] all right now i've got to reach that
[24:06] okay and i can get to that place but see
[24:09] i've fallen from that
[24:11] to where that i can't find it but a way
[24:15] can be made for me to come back to that
[24:18] and that is the tree of life that was
[24:21] what happened in the garden
[24:24] in the garden the way for man to be
[24:27] come forth for sin to enter the picture
[24:29] was permitted
[24:31] of god not created of god that way
[24:34] because you can't create sin
[24:37] all right see it was permitted
[24:40] so he permitted man to come into being
[24:44] in the basis that were that he could
[24:45] fall
[24:47] in the point of easy she was not an
[24:50] original creation
[24:53] meaning she was not an original person
[24:56] not in the point that she wasn't a part
[24:58] of adam
[25:01] huh i believe she was and maybe maybe
[25:04] you don't but all right just pray for me
[25:06] all right let's move on then i believe
[25:08] that eve was part of adam
[25:10] in the spiritual creation and then when
[25:14] it comes to the physical
[25:15] she was in him in physical creation
[25:19] taken from him and as he took from her
[25:23] from him the rib to make her star she
[25:26] stands
[25:31] as adam stood here
[25:35] and then god breathed into his nostrils
[25:37] and he became a living soul
[25:39] see then when eve was taken from adam
[25:43] she didn't necessarily have to be
[25:45] standing on the earth because he was the
[25:47] earth that she was in
[25:48] because he was she was over here with
[25:50] him in that but then he
[25:52] breathed into eve's nostrils and she
[25:54] became a living soul
[25:57] all right well yet the fall would take
[26:00] mankind into a lost condition
[26:03] but it did not take adam and eve to hell
[26:06] so they didn't fall from eternal life
[26:08] into bases that they never reached it
[26:10] because one day they will reach eternal
[26:14] life in flesh
[26:16] right one day they will reach eternal
[26:19] life in flesh
[26:20] they're not eternal now and that's why
[26:22] it's that away
[26:24] all right see then we brought it up from
[26:26] there let's try to run it into hurry we
[26:28] brought it up from there
[26:29] to where there was adam standing in the
[26:32] garden
[26:35] in the bases body
[26:39] not eternal soul eternal
[26:42] all right see then the second adam which
[26:45] was the lord jesus christ
[26:47] when he came into being
[26:51] the difference between adam and and and
[26:54] the lord jesus adam was created a
[26:56] full-grown man
[26:57] jesus was born or begotten through the
[27:01] wound of amer um
[27:03] of mary to where it would come forth
[27:05] that that
[27:06] you know everything would fall into the
[27:08] correct order all right
[27:09] now then that would bring us to jesus
[27:13] christ
[27:15] see throughout the old testament then
[27:17] you had no
[27:18] eternal life in soul for anybody
[27:24] because how could you because jesus
[27:26] christ had not died
[27:28] so he came for the purpose of dying he
[27:30] came to release it
[27:32] and all right we get to that real quick
[27:34] in the bases that
[27:35] there that jesus when he stood on earth
[27:38] now listen
[27:39] when he stood on earth what was he
[27:42] brother branham said and i've got them
[27:44] here in front of you want them he said
[27:46] in soul he was god
[27:50] but said in body he was a man
[27:57] now think about that
[28:04] that in seoul he was god
[28:07] the bible said that god was in christ
[28:11] reconciling the world to himself now why
[28:16] would it say it that way god was in
[28:18] christ
[28:22] you realize then to keep your
[28:24] understanding of
[28:25] doing that the body
[28:30] was a creation brought into being
[28:34] you know begotten brought into being
[28:37] all right but that body
[28:41] was not eternal so he went through his
[28:44] life for the 30-something years with
[28:46] that
[28:46] living in that human flesh and that
[28:49] human flesh was not eternal
[28:52] all right
[28:55] then look you've got the second adam
[28:58] being exactly like the first adam did
[29:01] you follow that
[29:02] point that i was trying to bring the
[29:04] second adam then the lord jesus christ
[29:07] stands in the garden
[29:10] soul almighty god body
[29:13] a human element same thing adam was
[29:17] that's why he's the second adam all
[29:20] right
[29:21] to make a way to where he could pay the
[29:23] price of sin
[29:25] for you and i heaven all right
[29:28] and see then that he would be a new
[29:32] creation
[29:35] but only in the basis of a new creation
[29:38] at that time
[29:39] was he uh in the point that he was god
[29:43] living in human flesh
[29:46] think about the godhead for a minute
[29:48] okay
[29:52] you realize that jesus now listen to my
[29:55] wording
[29:56] and don't get confused in the name of
[29:59] the way i say it
[30:00] just listen jesus
[30:03] was the flesh man
[30:09] right that was who he was that was his
[30:12] name
[30:13] jesus all right
[30:16] now don't jump away on over and say yeah
[30:18] but his name is gardener
[30:20] no just just listen
[30:25] jesus was a flesh man
[30:31] god lived in jesus
[30:38] and see by doing that he made the
[30:39] connection to the human race
[30:43] that he's not going back somewhere and
[30:46] going out of existence
[30:49] just remember what i'm trying to say
[30:51] think about it
[30:53] jesus the body
[30:59] we say but jesus was god no jesus i'm
[31:02] saying take my word
[31:04] and listen and don't jump ahead jesus
[31:08] was the body
[31:13] amen god lived in that body
[31:21] seeing that body wasn't eternal it
[31:23] wasn't the fact that it was lost or
[31:25] anything
[31:25] but it was the fact it had a beginning
[31:32] adam's body had a beginning
[31:37] jesus the body had a beginning
[31:41] but the god that dwelt within that
[31:44] never had no beginning amen
[31:48] he said well you know i don't
[31:52] well just think
[31:55] jesus the body
[32:00] and you'll see the first adam was adam
[32:03] the body
[32:04] and eternal life dwelling within his
[32:06] soul jesus when he came
[32:09] he came right back to the same creation
[32:12] that he had in the beginning with
[32:14] adam and jesus comes forth with
[32:17] a body a body the bible said
[32:21] thou hast prepared me or the father
[32:23] prepared him
[32:24] all right see that body was human
[32:27] elements
[32:31] but the difference was it was virgin
[32:34] born
[32:35] brother brother said the difference in
[32:36] god in you is the fact that says god was
[32:40] was virgin born
[32:44] we were naturally born but he was virgin
[32:48] born
[32:49] he went through the fact of living and
[32:51] and and you know
[32:52] and all and and within eve i mean
[32:56] within mary until the time come for him
[32:58] to come forth
[32:59] same thing as any other baby did but the
[33:02] difference
[33:03] is that she was not she didn't have
[33:07] anything to do
[33:09] your mom and daddy have something to do
[33:11] with you
[33:16] but she had nothing mary had nothing to
[33:18] do with it
[33:19] that's the difference in the mankind of
[33:22] adam
[33:23] and the mankind of the lord jesus
[33:26] but think about it and if you're
[33:30] thinking just
[33:31] just listen and just just think about it
[33:37] god condescending
[33:40] to earth
[33:44] and he come down and created a body
[33:50] his other part was him coming into being
[33:52] in a creation
[33:54] of the new creation new race
[33:58] all right the atom was a creation
[34:01] and a race
[34:05] but he couldn't pay the price
[34:08] but the lord jesus was a new creation
[34:11] new race
[34:12] why because he came for the point of
[34:14] paying the price
[34:18] all right now see then you you put it to
[34:22] the point of looking at it
[34:24] that that's why jesus could say
[34:32] father
[34:34] are you with me did he say father
[34:39] did he talk about his father did he talk
[34:42] about having a father
[34:46] then he was the son of god
[34:54] that's exactly who he was jesus was the
[34:57] son of god
[34:58] which was god made manifest
[35:03] in a human vessel
[35:08] called the sun
[35:13] a human vessel
[35:16] so that he could pay the price he had to
[35:19] become our
[35:20] head to become kinfolks to us to be able
[35:22] to pay the price of all of our sin
[35:24] and that way he had to come through the
[35:26] virgin mary
[35:27] and come into that being that away as
[35:30] begotten
[35:32] all right but can you comprehend the
[35:36] godhead like that and
[35:38] listen about it and give you something
[35:41] to think about because you'll run across
[35:42] it
[35:43] just just keep reading and you'll run
[35:46] across
[35:48] quote after quote after quote where
[35:50] brother random talks about
[35:52] jesus being the body
[35:56] and god being the spirit that was
[36:00] dwelling within the body
[36:06] but see that will never end
[36:09] adam's body
[36:13] will someday have to be made eternal
[36:21] jesus's body was made eternal in the
[36:24] resurrection
[36:29] right the resurrection the ascension the
[36:33] change as we call it
[36:37] his body was made eternal right amen
[36:42] and see by his body being made eternal
[36:45] made him a new creation new race
[36:49] no longer dealing by the old creation
[36:53] a new creation
[36:56] he was god in human flesh
[37:03] when you realize by the new birth
[37:10] by the new birth you
[37:13] are god in human flesh
[37:18] now that has a ring back to it because
[37:22] we think that that's that's just a
[37:24] little bit too far
[37:25] no that's exactly what it is
[37:30] we are his offspring we're his children
[37:36] he brought us into being amen
[37:39] all right the new creation
[37:42] new race stood back there
[37:46] and says mary
[37:50] and she finally recognized him right
[37:54] right she finally recognized that that
[37:57] was the lord jesus
[37:59] he said touch me not because i'm not yet
[38:01] ascended i don't understand all of that
[38:03] don't worry about it
[38:05] but there was some reason that she could
[38:06] not touch him at that time
[38:10] you can have your opinions or whatever i
[38:11] don't know because it doesn't bother me
[38:14] but i know it's true i know he couldn't
[38:16] she couldn't touch him
[38:18] all right but in just a matter of a
[38:21] little time
[38:23] she could hold touch him others could
[38:26] touch him
[38:27] something was taking place that was
[38:30] making that body
[38:31] into a position of eternity
[38:35] see then no man hath reached immortality
[38:39] which immortality means mortal flesh
[38:41] made eternal that's the best way of
[38:43] saying it
[38:45] thank you the lord jesus christ the body
[38:49] was made eternal
[38:54] see you and i've got to do that
[38:58] but why not think about it
[39:02] we're already in the process
[39:06] right yes we're in the process of being
[39:10] changed
[39:11] what do you think the change i mean my
[39:13] wife talked the other day about it she
[39:14] said
[39:14] what do you think the change is i said
[39:17] well i don't know
[39:19] in other words i don't know what's going
[39:20] to cause it or what is going to
[39:22] mechanically take place
[39:25] you know or whatever you say
[39:28] i don't know but i know it's got to be
[39:33] true all right and see then when
[39:37] when our body is made eternal because
[39:40] we're doing the same thing adam would
[39:42] have done
[39:42] had adam and eve not sinned they had the
[39:45] tree of life
[39:46] that they could have went to the tree of
[39:47] life and ate of that tree of life
[39:52] and everything would have been great
[39:56] all right do you realize what i'm saying
[39:59] to you
[40:00] the more you read the word of god you're
[40:03] reading the tree of life
[40:06] you're inhaling or are you know taken
[40:09] within you
[40:10] the word because that was what created
[40:14] all things
[40:17] see the logos the theophany the word of
[40:20] god the son of god the being
[40:22] that was back there
[40:29] is now coming forth in you
[40:38] you say well what is it going to be to
[40:41] make us well i know one thing for sure
[40:43] here's part of it the statue of a
[40:45] perfect man because if these virtues can
[40:48] be added to the human being
[40:50] it's going to bring us to a position to
[40:52] where that we can take the change
[40:54] i know that
[41:00] see i know that that romans 8 covers
[41:05] that it comes down in finality of
[41:07] adoptions and things
[41:10] and when it finishes up it says to wit
[41:14] the redemption of our body
[41:17] we got to have an adoption for it
[41:22] to wit to understand
[41:27] somebody's going to come to a place of
[41:30] understanding what's taking place
[41:34] but why can't we understand you simply
[41:36] if you eat
[41:37] you become what you are
[41:40] yes sir and if you're eating the word of
[41:43] god
[41:46] thank you
[41:50] why not eat it why not just enjoy it
[41:54] we said at night and listen sometimes
[41:56] three four tapes
[41:57] because wade's pecans come in this time
[42:00] and they're
[42:00] and we're we're beating their knuckles
[42:02] over there
[42:04] doing these pecans and getting them out
[42:06] and
[42:07] you know and uh
[42:11] maybe we could just sit there and listen
[42:12] to a type a little just
[42:14] cycle through into the next tape and
[42:16] into the next one into the next one
[42:18] i've done that on a deer stand where you
[42:20] just take i got the little thing that
[42:22] joanna made richard and them made for me
[42:24] years ago
[42:25] and i can take that and just put it in
[42:27] my pocket and connect it up
[42:28] stick it in my ear as long as the
[42:30] battery holds out i can just keep
[42:32] listening
[42:33] well i ain't got nothing else to do
[42:37] i mean i'm sitting there uh you know
[42:42] so i can just sit there and listen
[42:47] what did the prophet say about it you
[42:49] become the word
[42:50] as what as you receive it or hear
[42:54] it or take a part of it you become the
[42:57] word amen
[42:59] you realize what you're doing you're
[43:02] eating your way back
[43:10] now a lot of us have ate a lot
[43:14] the wrong way of going back
[43:17] you know and uh we're kind of lost out
[43:20] that's what i told brother langor
[43:21] years ago i've been around brother lungo
[43:24] a long time you know and
[43:26] he'd get on them dot things and christ
[43:28] died and he
[43:29] brother gary atkins would do it get on
[43:30] one boy he just lose weight and
[43:33] and then you say oh hey that looks good
[43:36] then about a month later you see him
[43:38] that his belt buckles
[43:40] he can back out you know i said brother
[43:42] homer i said in the years i've known you
[43:44] you you've gained and lost over a
[43:46] thousand pounds
[43:52] well
[43:54] but i want to eat the word don't you
[43:57] see that's the point that's what i try
[44:00] to do i try to get you
[44:01] i ask you listen you remember the other
[44:04] day i was
[44:05] listening back to what i said
[44:08] if you want to think about something on
[44:10] the new creation you raise
[44:11] just go to christ the mystery of god
[44:13] reveal
[44:15] and go through that message over and
[44:17] over and over
[44:20] just listen to it god
[44:24] had a plan and a purpose that he was
[44:27] going to achieve
[44:30] he said it was to let himself be
[44:33] expressed
[44:35] is that the way the prophet was saying
[44:38] let itself be expressed
[44:42] and see he didn't start out just now now
[44:45] here's one we're going to swallow and
[44:48] listen
[44:51] remember he didn't bring mankind over
[44:54] here
[44:55] and start a creation maybe i don't know
[44:59] how to say this but
[45:03] the genesis 1 26 and 27 man
[45:06] was in eternal life
[45:10] it was back there before the world ever
[45:12] begun
[45:13] right it was eternal life before the
[45:16] world ever begun
[45:19] he said this thing was started but that
[45:22] way and we've got to come back to that
[45:25] see i do know that much about the change
[45:28] to to come to a change we're going to
[45:30] have to come
[45:32] to the place and the bases that where
[45:34] the lord jesus come to a place
[45:37] and he was changed and you and i are
[45:40] going to have to come to a place to be
[45:42] changed
[45:44] it's not how much we know
[45:48] it's not that away
[45:52] well why shouldn't we know it
[45:56] i mean we we we're not like the
[45:59] denominations that
[46:00] you know they'll they'll just preach and
[46:03] go on and do
[46:04] we we are supposed to be becoming the
[46:08] word
[46:11] well if that's becoming the word then
[46:13] we're going back to where we was
[46:15] see we was the word in the beginning
[46:17] that's why the prophet could say it you
[46:19] know
[46:19] he said you always was eternal
[46:24] but the point of it is see don't go the
[46:26] wrong way of that
[46:27] well i always was eternal so i don't
[46:29] need salvation now you're wrong
[46:33] you're wrong you missed the whole point
[46:36] you need salvation to bring you to
[46:39] redemption
[46:43] all right see then the point we need to
[46:46] get
[46:47] is to see we are now
[46:50] going through exactly the things that
[46:52] the that adam went through
[46:58] and coming to the same end adam finally
[47:00] eventually stood on earth
[47:01] he went through stage one stage two he
[47:04] stood on earth then
[47:06] as eternal life in the soul
[47:10] and a body that needed redemption
[47:15] see then you and i are coming the same
[47:16] way
[47:19] coming to realize what we were
[47:22] and and knowing what we were is we know
[47:25] that's where we're going to have to go
[47:26] back to
[47:29] can you follow that thought we got to go
[47:31] back to where we started
[47:40] and see we started with eternal life
[47:42] when he gave us the new birth
[47:44] sure we lost a channel we lost
[47:46] everything we couldn't do that
[47:48] but when he come forth and made a way
[47:50] for a new birth
[47:51] then redemption could come into view and
[47:53] then you and i could
[47:54] say that we are a new creature in christ
[47:57] jesus
[48:02] because a natural preacher a natural
[48:04] person has a body spirit and soul
[48:07] but there are none of those eternal
[48:10] but a christian has within them
[48:15] the new birth and that new birth
[48:21] is to make forth and bring us to a
[48:23] position
[48:25] bring us to a change bring us up through
[48:28] the stature of a perfect man
[48:29] bring us out through the adoptional
[48:31] stages bring us out to all of those
[48:34] things the prophet taught you see why
[48:36] the prophet had to come
[48:41] he just didn't come to just show god to
[48:43] the world and
[48:44] and let them see this and that he come
[48:47] to get his people
[48:50] god come down and little man
[48:56] to deliver a message
[49:00] that's one that i'm looking forward
[49:03] i'm looking forward to the point of the
[49:06] change of the body
[49:10] because see i know that that's the part
[49:12] of redemption that is not fully made
[49:14] manifest yet
[49:17] we've come through justification
[49:19] sanctification
[49:21] the baptism of the holy ghost some may
[49:23] be coming through adoptions
[49:25] some coming through statue of a perfect
[49:27] man because
[49:28] everybody's not on the same level
[49:31] somewhere ahead of the others is up and
[49:32] down
[49:33] all right but we're all waiting one
[49:36] thing
[49:38] to wit
[49:41] to understand that word to wit has other
[49:44] meanings to it
[49:45] but it has a great meaning to me and the
[49:47] basis that i think it's in the bible
[49:49] 20 sometimes but to wit
[49:53] to understand
[49:57] that's where it's in the uh let's see in
[50:00] the scripture
[50:02] let me look and see
[50:07] yeah he said where we read in our
[50:11] scriptures from second corinthians 5 17
[50:13] therefore if any man be in christ he's a
[50:15] new creature
[50:16] old things are passed away behold all
[50:20] things are become new
[50:22] and it drops down to wit that god was in
[50:25] christ
[50:27] to understand
[50:31] that god was in christ reconciling the
[50:34] world
[50:35] to himself god was in christ he was
[50:39] in human flesh he became that's the
[50:42] mystery of it all
[50:43] is that god and man has become one
[50:49] he's a new creature
[50:52] but you see the new creation you race in
[50:56] the human element is not finished until
[50:58] we come to where
[50:59] where the lord jesus looks
[51:03] when we reach the eternal life then we
[51:05] are a new creature
[51:09] a new creation all right
[51:13] what are we going to look like
[51:16] we're going to look like him
[51:20] because we're in his image we're in his
[51:22] likeness
[51:26] and what are we going to be we're going
[51:29] to look like him
[51:32] because we're his offspring we're his
[51:36] children
[51:37] now we're not the the point of it is
[51:40] we're we're difference of sizes and
[51:42] differences and
[51:43] all kind of things but yet still
[51:46] we are his offspring we're his children
[51:50] think about it
[51:54] the point i'm trying to get you to see
[51:55] today is one thing
[51:57] jesus was god in human flesh
[52:02] called the son of god
[52:05] amen amen and jesus was
[52:09] god in human flesh called the son of god
[52:15] all right you know what you are god in
[52:19] human place
[52:21] called the son of god amen by the new
[52:25] birth
[52:26] you're a child of god all right
[52:30] jesus was begotten
[52:34] the only difference between him and us
[52:35] in the coming jesus was begotten
[52:38] born of a baby virgin born et cetera et
[52:41] cetera
[52:42] you know but adam was created
[52:46] full grown man see
[52:51] all right are you listening
[52:57] adam had eternal life
[53:02] in his soul
[53:08] he could not impart that
[53:14] no so it would take the second adam
[53:20] according to the scriptures to come
[53:22] forth
[53:24] and to be able to give us his
[53:28] life
[53:31] right amen see adam was created full
[53:34] grown but jesus was begotten
[53:37] from the wound of a woman
[53:41] all right in body he was a man
[53:47] in soul he was god
[53:52] a new creation
[53:58] adam spoke of it
[54:02] but he fell from coming to that position
[54:05] he never reached that position
[54:07] of eternal life in his body
[54:10] so he fell from it so the prophet's
[54:12] right
[54:14] he fell from eternal life to death what
[54:17] he died well yet he had an atonement
[54:20] that's right it was already made before
[54:23] the world ever begun because jesus
[54:25] christ stood as a lamb slain
[54:26] before the foundation of the world so he
[54:29] had an atonement
[54:30] amen okay
[54:34] amen god put his own life
[54:38] into adam
[54:41] and adam became a living soul
[54:47] no one else down through time
[54:51] until the lord jesus christ
[54:54] could come forth with eternal life
[54:58] right so then jesus would have to pay
[55:02] the price
[55:06] he would have to come in human flesh be
[55:09] jesus the flesh man
[55:15] he would have to come forth to give that
[55:18] life
[55:19] that you and i could receive that life
[55:23] all right now that's not hard to
[55:26] understand is it
[55:28] well is it hard to understand then
[55:32] that adam and eve being the first of a
[55:36] human race
[55:39] right well it was first of a human race
[55:40] that was a adam and eve
[55:43] all right they lost that position
[55:48] but they never lost eternal life
[55:53] what position did they lose they lost
[55:57] coming to that position
[56:02] of to where that they would be
[56:05] god in human flesh
[56:10] he said yeah but you're saying now that
[56:11] we're you know because we're the
[56:13] children of god
[56:14] adam and eve and wouldn't count it as
[56:16] the children of god
[56:19] why because they lost that position
[56:23] abraham was never called nothing but
[56:25] god's friend
[56:28] he was never called the son of god
[56:32] check your bible abraham was
[56:39] not a let's see how would you say it he
[56:41] was
[56:43] a special man for a special job
[56:47] but yet he still couldn't achieve
[56:52] he could speak of it he could come forth
[56:54] and show and god could use him
[56:56] but he couldn't come forth in the
[56:58] redemptive
[56:59] for you and i
[57:03] all right but jesus did
[57:07] he gave his life that you and i might
[57:09] have eternal life
[57:11] and see this is not just stopping
[57:13] because he's he didn't stop
[57:16] he didn't come forth and just deliver
[57:19] uh redemption as body spirit and soul
[57:23] his body went to eternal life so now
[57:26] he's a new creation do you realize when
[57:29] he was standing there
[57:30] he was a new creature
[57:33] a new creation god
[57:37] and man had become one
[57:41] you see that's where we got to come he
[57:43] said i don't see how do we could ever do
[57:45] it brother dale
[57:46] well it ain't up to us to do it amen
[57:50] now listen for a minute and i'll quit
[57:52] he's
[57:53] already taken care of it
[57:59] he's already paid the price
[58:02] all we've got to do is believe it
[58:06] and accept the fact that he's paid our
[58:08] price for us
[58:09] and that everything is there and that we
[58:11] are his offspring
[58:15] because if we have now listen that's why
[58:18] adam could never fall to death see
[58:20] that's where people would
[58:21] read what brother ryan says and they
[58:22] don't listen to what he talked about
[58:24] adam couldn't fall to death you know
[58:26] what i mean he couldn't die and go to
[58:28] hell or anything
[58:32] you want to quote from the prophet you
[58:33] know why he couldn't he said because he
[58:36] had the breath of eternal god in his
[58:38] soul
[58:42] the breath of eternal life in his soul
[58:44] so adam could not never be lost
[58:50] you realize that with the new birth
[58:53] christ in you there's no way you can
[58:56] ever be lost
[59:01] might have a lot of problems and things
[59:03] and doing life and all but
[59:05] you can't be lost that's wonderful to me
[59:10] that's eternal life in your soul
[59:13] and if i have eternal life in my soul
[59:15] then one day my body is going to follow
[59:17] it
[59:18] you say how do you know because he is
[59:20] followed amen
[59:22] he came to eternal life in soul spirit
[59:25] body right because he was eternal god
[59:30] that's what i'm trying to say to you
[59:31] about the godhead if you just think
[59:34] about it
[59:37] the body
[59:41] the body was a man amen
[59:45] the soul is the eternal god
[59:49] what about that you realize then how
[59:52] close we are to it
[59:57] we're right on the verge of being
[59:59] changed because that's the next thing
[1:00:03] now not that everybody has already
[1:00:05] achieved and all of that no
[1:00:06] no but somebody has
[1:00:11] i believe that i believe somebody has
[1:00:13] achieved the place and the position
[1:00:15] and they're waiting on the rest of us
[1:00:21] to realize what's taking place the
[1:00:23] prophet has brought the message
[1:00:30] eternal life is a is not just something
[1:00:33] looking out you under
[1:00:37] eternal life is the person of jesus
[1:00:41] christ coming into you
[1:00:44] and we do that by the new birth well
[1:00:47] what would be the change of the body
[1:00:49] just another step brother
[1:00:52] had a good way of thinking he's it's
[1:00:53] just another step
[1:00:56] if you remember him that's the way he
[1:00:57] made the stuff he said just another step
[1:00:59] he said
[1:01:00] it's not a long big one you got to run
[1:01:02] and jump he said it's just another step
[1:01:06] think on these things what about it
[1:01:12] we are standing at the threshold of
[1:01:15] eternal life
[1:01:20] if not then
[1:01:23] what are we going to do
[1:01:28] he said well what can you do brother
[1:01:30] dale what can we do
[1:01:32] to try to help this take place read and
[1:01:35] pray
[1:01:37] listen to the prophet's message listen
[1:01:40] to the word
[1:01:42] and you'll find out what you are right
[1:01:44] we was just
[1:01:45] in our lives not listening to one we
[1:01:47] brought around and said
[1:01:48] god said all of these viruses and things
[1:01:51] and plagues that's around here
[1:01:54] you know i mean he was he was praying
[1:01:59] for me last night and all of us right
[1:02:03] because that viruses and things is here
[1:02:09] because it's real come on musicians
[1:02:12] think on these things
[1:02:15] we'll try to pick up maybe going into
[1:02:18] some things on adoption or something
[1:02:20] just pick up a thought
[1:02:22] but the main thing i want you to see
[1:02:26] is when we start believing and seeing
[1:02:30] who we are
[1:02:33] and what's taking place
[1:02:38] right
[1:02:41] to see who we are and what's taking
[1:02:42] place not what's going to take place
[1:02:45] that's that's the problem we're looking
