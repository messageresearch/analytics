receive lord god this portion of your word we ask these things now in jesus christ's name amen amen praise the lord let's read from from james chapter one james chapter one and i want to talk tonight just a little topic a little a little bit different amen from all the from all the teaching we received and all the the deepness that we received on sunday available a little bit something that kind of loosened us up a little bit and hopefully it'll help us amen amen but i want to talk tonight about under pressure under pressure and i'm not talking about the song either there was a song in the 80s called undepression that's not that's not what but [Laughter] don't look at me that way but we want to talk about how many how many are felt being under pressure how many felt pressured today each and every one of us no matter what age we we are we are or how old we are or how young we are we we have felt or are feeling some form of pressure amen and and it's it's part of life there's nothing wrong with it it's just how you handle it and how you respond to it is is is what is what we need to look at so um pressure is good we need we all need to have pressure and we'll we'll get into that for in just a moment but let's just read here in james chapter 1 and i don't want to keep you standing too long it says here in verse 2 my brethren counted all joy when ye fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all man liberally liberally in other words that he just freely amen and upbraideth not and it shall be given him but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth or is unstable it's like a wave of the sea that is driven with the wind and tossed and it just goes every every way for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the lord if if he's if he's asking wavering a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways don't you hate that you know sometimes you you ask a person and like hey what you want to do well i don't know what you want to do i don't know what you want to do well let's go here that's fine uh well maybe we should go here well you just said that's fine no well no you know and you're like oh my goodness [Music] a double-minded man you just kind of you kind of you hate that right and god hates it too see if you hate it in the flesh how much more god a man that's not stable a person that is not stable in the in the word that is not stable in what you have believed and you continue to go back to your dead works thinking that that's what's going to save you knowing that and you go back to the sins that you may did 10 years ago 15 years ago lord i'm sorry amen god doesn't like that if it's under the blood it's under the blood if it's there is now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus the question is and the problem is is that maybe you have not connected to christ you're not in christ jesus and that's why you keep wavering back and forth amen praise god so a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted but the rich in that he is made low because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away for the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat but it where but it withereth the grass and the flower thereof falleth and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways especially if he doesn't have god blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life i like that james says that it's not that you're not going to go through temptation james doesn't say that james knows that the believer and the christian is going to go through temptation but blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord hath promised to them that love him now do you love him amen praise the lord you may be seated this afternoon amen so under pressure this afternoon and i'll uh that just looking at that clock puts me under pressure yeah because i mean you know this time is is a pressure element and we re we know that even in the beginning there was no there was no time it wasn't until sin came in the picture that time came in the picture which means pressures came in the picture right we are growing up in life we have pressure as we're growing up and and we got stages that we're growing up you know a little a five-year-old maybe all they're worrying about is what they're gonna eat tomorrow you know or what they're gonna have for for dinner tonight or if they're gonna go to cookout and have a milkshake after after service tonight or not uh you know that that's the pressures that they're having but then you get a 15 year old you know the pressure that they have now i just started 9th grade high school or 10th grade and the pressures of my goodness this is a brand new school oh this is a i don't have any friends all the friends i had in middle school uh they're not gonna be there at that new school and and there's that pressure that you have you know as a 15 year old the 25 year old doesn't have the pressures that a 15 year will have because here the pressures have been elevated now i mean now they're thinking about what am i going to do with my life now i've gone maybe through a few years of college now and i may be thinking about getting married or i am i'm just a newlywed now and now you got the pressures of of of of trying to be a husband or trying to and and some have even been fathers at that young age you know i got married when i was 25 years old uh didn't have we didn't have bella until i was 26 27 i think yeah 26 something like that but but all that pressure came on me all almost all at the same time bella came on the scene about uh what 10 months after we got married or or more a year or more but it was that pressure you know marriage and then here comes the children you see and and there's that pressure now i'm not saying that's anything wrong that i'm just saying don't take that in the wrong way it was just it was just it was just bam there it is you see it wasn't the same pressures that i had when i was 15 years old when i was at papa john's just spinning pizza you know oh man everything was hunky dory you know i mean oh man it was it was fun now i got different pressures and now the pressures that i had at 25 years old is not the pressures that i have now at 41. now i have other pressures now on top of that you culminate the pressures that you get from life you know in the world systems now and and and the way and even in in this last year we've all gone through all kinds of pressures i don't think we we we we considered and we realized the type of pressures that we were going to be in in 2021 even at 2020 now we see all kinds of pressures put on us that we never realized that we would have amen but it's pressures it's pressures right you know the bible uh the the word pressure it means this it's a it means if the brothers can put this definition up i think i gave it to him yes it's a continuous physical force exerted on or against an object by something in contact with it amen definition number two it says the use of persuasion influence or intimidation to make someone do something and you know i was i was uh the other day i was at racetrack on monday and we were we were going to have we were i was going to go to central office at a board meeting and i had a i was going to buy some food i had some coffee that i had gotten and i was at the line you know waiting you know i had this this stuff because i was that was my lunch actually it was around 2 p.m two through 3 p.m and i'm just looking around and you know you're looking around and everything is just kind of uh there are all kinds of signs grabbing your attention you know get grab me get this get this and i'm sitting there in the sun you know i think i have enough and i look over at the krispy kreme little little booth there and they had it had a it had to say a thing that said on there it says you deserve one actually you deserve two yeah right too i was actually getting ready to just hey can you hold this for just a moment let me grab two because that's how that's how persuasive and how pressured you know they they that the advertising is you know i mean you know who's not thinking that they deserve hey i just had a rough day i deserve two maybe three [Laughter] who doesn't think that you know and and and isn't that how how satan does to us as christians you know you deserve that sure just let off some steam you know you've been you've had it's been rough you know it's it it's been rough and and and you know you deserve that time right there and you're in front of the computer and god and he's tempting you to do who knows what amen you deserve that time and then you find yourself in guilt condemnation why in the world it's a pressure it's a temptation of depression you see three an attempt to persuade or coerce someone into doing something amen that's a pressure yeah amen and we they're definitely seeing that a lot today amen so pressure is is as i said earlier pressure is a necessary uh thing it's not just it's a survival mechanism for but but but also to live for also to live a christian life amen you need certain amounts of pressure in your life amen for example if we're a piano when it's being tuned it's got to have certain pressure put on the strings and if you don't give it that certain pressure i mean because of the of the temperature in here the the hot and the cold it makes the the strings a man condensed and and and and you know get get wide and and condensed and things like that so you need that pressure that piano tuner needs that pressure to put that pressure under to make that piano sound good again same thing with a guitar and you can say the same thing with the violin there's got to be a certain pressures put on these instruments in order to make them sound good see if you just leave the the guitar just like that you see and never and never do anything to it it'll it'll it'll be out of tune it will never sound good you see you have to apply certain pressures right here with this pad these pegs right and when you apply certain the certain pressures and and and the and the the one that's that plays the instrument he he's making sure he's looking uh okay i've applied certain pre i like the way that sounds now yes that sounds just right you see right but he had to apply certain pressures you see and don't think that you can live your life amen your christian life with with no pressures at all because whoever told you that when you become a christian and you're never going to have a problem in your life sold you a bill of goods and and is probably trying to put something on you amen amen because that's not how it is jesus said if you don't take up your cross and follow me you have no part in me you've got to take up the cross and we're talking about his cross amen was a cross of made of wood it was heavy right if we're looking at the physical cross right he was talking spiritually but if we're looking at his physical cross it was a heavy cross but you see when you're carrying his cross it actually becomes light because he says you take my burden my burden is light amen so it's not it's not a push and pull thing now to serve god it's you want to take up the cross you want to do it lord it doesn't matter what what i need what needs to happen i want to take up the cross but because you put the want to in me when you don't want to it becomes a burden i've got to go to church i i've got to i've got to sing songs i've got i've i've got to him when you have to come over then it becomes a burden but when god puts that want in you amen things become lighter you see things things become lighter doesn't mean it's easier but it just becomes lighter amen praise god we see also a woman when she's having a baby you know she she's under pressure those of you mothers here who've had children you understand that when you're carrying a child when you're carrying life there comes a point after the eight and nine months amen that that baby starts putting that pressure i'm getting ready to come out you ready or not uh here i come it's time here i come and you start feeling that pressure and and even though she's crying she's weeping and and she might be screaming and telling them get me drugs do something that that baby's coming out that's right that baby's coming out is that pressure but then once all that dissipates once the baby comes you're not even thinking about the pressure anymore you're thinking about that life on you hey man that baby now you know how she how how you have her on her chest now you're not even thinking the pressure that you have you see amen when when when when you've gone through a trial in your life and and and it was hard it was difficult amen but when you get to the other side of it amen you don't even think about the details of the things that took that you went through amen you're just rejoicing and you're you're praising god for the for the outcome amen praise god you're not you're and then maybe you can sit back and relax after you're praising god you can sit back and relax lord you brought me through that right amen oh my amen what an awesome god we serve and he said yes i brought you through that and it out actually wants to it makes you want to praise him even more amen through many tolls and dangers he's brought us through amen praise god sometimes you know in life we have pressures amen that we that that that we bottle up inside amen uh that we if we if we couple with with the with we have this pressure and then we couple it with the with the pressure of not showing it that's right that actually creates even more pressure you see it's a false it's a and then you're putting you're you're putting a false image before people a man you know you got this pressure inside of you and but you don't want to show it because you don't want to make maybe your mom and dad look bad or or the church look bad you see you don't want to show it but in any moment amen somebody says the wrong thing to you it comes out somebody does something to you that you know it comes out because why it's bottled up pressure from maybe things that have happened in your life that have never got taken care of or never got resolved bottled up pressures amen and then couple it with the pressure of i can't show it right that's that's a that's a lot of pressure amen how many how many have uh uh since i and since 2007 i believe brother donna you might know this they started making the vehicles where they have the tpm the tire pressure uh monitor and it's just a little computer thing where it monitors the pressure of the tires as you're riding and uh it'll tell you if it's undeflated if the tires are under flat or if they're over inflated now do you know that because sometimes we think that a tire will bust or you know will will blow up if you put too much pressure in it right and that is true right but do you also know that if you have a tire that's under pressure that it will also cause a blow up and actually the blow up happens from the inside out right but donnie's agreeing with me it happens from the inside out right and then all the grinding of the tire and then you if you look inside the tire i was actually watching a little video about then when you look inside the tires just a bunch of the tire you know just grind it up inside and there's it causes a blow up so too much pressure causes a blow up under pressure causes a blow up as well you've got to have the right level in your life see god that's why i'm saying jesus did not say you become a christian and everything is going to be hunky-dory you've got to have the right level of pressure in your life so it's it's healthy to have pressures it's healthy to have pressure amen it's not a bad thing it's not a bad thing so but it's good it's good that we when we have that pressure amen in our lives that bottled up pressure amen that we find some way to release that amen a healthy way to release that amen not just any old way a healthy way amen look what brother branham says here in this message show us the father and it will satisfy us he says i said sure if they want me he was talking to somebody about the pentecostal church because they were you know they were uh they were saying i can't i don't understand why those pentecostals they're just jumping and shouting and screaming and all that stuff you know and brother brown says here sure they won't make the wheel roll right they've got to blow it out the whistle somewhere they've got a lot of steam i said and that's the truth if this pentecostal church would take a lot of its praises and put it to work it would do something for the kingdom of god all right god give you the holy ghost you like to shout by it and praise by it but just put that into grips and wonders and go out on the street and get sinners to come in and things like that your church will grow and everything will go along all right don't blow it out the whistle put it into action and let make the wheel roll the gospel train amen put put it into action you you know we we we got we got to let it out amen but but put it into something good am i right amen put it into action something that will will benefit you will benefit others and will glorify god amen praise god just because you're stressed or or just because uh uh you feel uh or you're happy about about about something about god in in church amen and often times we want to do something amen that maybe it might be inappropriate amen but find an avenue to let the pressure out you see find an avenue to let the pressure out because we've all got to have the pressure out amen we're just walking pressure cookers we got you know we'll i'll mention it here in just a moment but as a pressure cooker you know you got to have that little venue amen where the pressure's coming out constantly because if not that thing will blow up amen amen and some people they don't work well under pressure that's right amen some people do their best work under pressure i i would i would think that that's that's me but i don't know i i am i'm just i'm i'm like brother richard hyatt said the other day you know my sermons come two hours before the service yeah [Laughter] i just cannot prepare three weeks in advance for a sermon it just it's just not me because he put it right he said because you're going to go in there and start editing in it and start changing it and it's never right it's never going to be perfect amen now i've had moments where you have to be on the spot and you have to be ready in season and out of season they meant to just preach something i've had those moments in the mission field at other times amen that pressure falls on you amen amen and and some some of us you know some of you who went through high school and and maybe you do your best work when the day before you had to turn in your exam you know or or or the project or whatever it was and that's how i was but it never came out good [Laughter] i just always left things for the last minute and and and sometimes i got a good grade out of it you know but but that's just that's that's just me it's just but some of us we just work different ways amen some of us we've got to have it three weeks in advance right we've got to have it ahead of time amen so in the scripture that we were talking about here in james james he was speaking about how often times we we you know our temptations is to our temptations our pressure on us amen and it's under these pressures of life that that we recognize how strong we are amen it's in it's in it's in being in these pressures is we recognize uh am i drawing am i closer to god or am i further away from god you see because it's the way you respond to them it's the way you you react to them amen if you're not if you're not fellowshipping amen at church let's just put it in if you're not fellowshipping at church if you're not in the word of god if you're not listening to the message if you're not listening to the right things amen somebody says something to you at church amen and you'll immediately you'll take it as something antagonistic and you snap why because your concentration and your fellowship has been with other things of this world amen instead of the word of god you'll you'll immediately take it that way because you have been fellowshipping and you have been feeding on the wrong things take a person or a brother amen who has been feeding on the word of god who's who's been in contact with the with god in prayer and and who has been in fellowship amen and in that prayer closet amen it's always filled amen and when they come to church amen you can say whatever you wanted to them amen and they'll they'll take it a different way a more calm way they should at least that's right amen because why the holy spirit is working amen but when you when you when your holy spirit is up there amen just like brother branham said amen you can you can uh uh grieve the holy spirit amen does it mean that he's left you but i mean you can grieve him and then you're wondering my why is my life going this way why is it that i don't feel the joy that i that i've i felt even last week nice because your priorities of things changed now when you were fellowshipping with the word and in prayer amen and in your own time with god now something else has taken now you're worshiping something else amen so that will cause us to react under pressures in different ways amen proverbs 24 10 tells us if thou faint in the day of adversity watch what it says it says thy strength is small in other words if you fall the niv version says if you fall if you fail under pressure your strength is too small amen well i mean that's simple but we do it all the time we do it all the time why because we're under the wrong influence many times you know when you're weight lifting you've got to have that pressure amen upon your upon your muscles amen constantly amen and and you know amen how strong you are because look what the bible says that your strength is too small if you fell under pressure right and then when you when you feel like you you know you started maybe uh bench pressing you know a hundred pounds or whatever and then you bench spread okay i can do that now i want to upgrade to 200 and then you and then you oh no i can't do this you recognize where you're weak right right you recognize where you need to work on you went too much maybe you should you go to 110 right if you could do 100 you see you take it little by little amen and it's in the trials of life in us living amen is in us living day to day that's why we cannot be just shut in somewhere and not experience the hardships of life or the negative aspects of life because when when that comes to you head on amen you don't you're just going to burst and you don't know what how you're going to handle it you've got to have the negative aspects of life otherwise you're not living life you've got to have that that way you can bench press the 200 pounds when you get to it if you don't experience 110 120 130 150 you see how you gonna bench press the 200. amen you see so you've got to have the negative uh us as parents hey man we think sometimes well no i can't have my kid do that or see that or no because and then that that's going to come to them anyways so let them just experience it amen so because we're doing the service if we do that you see we're doing them as a service if we think that we can just over shelter them so much you see we're doing them at the service um let's look at diamonds here for just a moment if the brothers can can bring this picture picture number one amen you love the lord amen praise god all right so here here's a diamond isn't that so beautiful so pretty and all the girls are saying yeah that's beautiful look at that it was an engagement ring like that you know now you guys it's for girls but it i mean it's beautiful but you think my i'd love to have a diamond ring like that you girls oh that'd be pretty it'd be nice if if i'm going to get married in my hu and my husband-to-be gives me a diamond ring like this oh my that's that's beautiful and then if you go to the next picture you realize that this is where it came out of now do you want the diamond ring now the diamond ring came out of this that's out of this dark mess this nastiness this is coal this is what this is where diamonds are found and even even then diamonds go back to the previous picture brother diamonds when they come out of coal don't even look like this because it actually that took actually a a person that works with diamonds starting to cut the diamonds a certain way to make it look this way but definitely when they take the diamond out of the coal you know it definitely looks nicer than the coal for sure but when the diamond when the when the jeweler gets a hold of it oh my god he makes it even more beautiful amen when the jeweler of the god when our god the jeweler amen he gets a hold of your life amen it might hurt it might it might sting amen but hey you come out tried as gold amen you come out nice looking good amen because sometimes we come out rough amen next show the next picture right there we come out rough amen from the world you see we we come out rough i mean you don't expect somebody uh to immediately i mean they just do everything right when they start serving god no some of us come out come out a little rough amen somehow some of us come out a little you know we still got some habits that we need to let let go amen but it takes god to do that work it takes god little by little amen to do that work and when somebody's pressuring you listen you got to get rid of that you you can't come to church like that i i mean there comes a point in time where if you say you're a christian and you're still doing certain things i mean all right yeah we got to say something amen but but god amen deals with us little by little amen that's why we should have patience with one another amen i can't be your holy ghost i've always said that you can't be my holy ghost and and i can't be my daughter's holy ghost amen it takes an experience with god for them amen to to come out amen exactly the way god envisioned them from the beginning amen praise god because god has the best image better image of my children amen than i could ever have he knows best for them so does he knows best for your children amen but if but sometimes we want to impose our image on them and all we're doing is just putting them in a certain place where they don't want to come to church anymore because we want to impose our image amen it's not about your image it's about the image of god it's about the image of the word amen well i want that's the image that we want to we want them to have so that's where diamonds come out of and and and and diamonds uh uh there are what they are is crystallized carbon or coals that are formed underneath the earth under heavy heat and pressure see they're formed underneath the earth and there has to be a lot of heat and a lot of pressure for them otherwise you're not going to have a diamond yeah see next picture as you'll see so you get from a piece of coal and then you can get something like that how many knows that god can do work how many knows how many how many believe that god has done a work like that in your life he's still cutting me you know it ain't until that body change amen till i really come out perfect amen praise god but he's still cutting each and every one of us amen but we're diamonds god already sees the end the end result amen when he was taking us out of the piece of lump amen see we were in the middle of the lump amen we were in the middle of the of the darkness amen but he was already seeing the end result right there he saw it before the foundation of the world he saw you amen perfect without spot without wrinkles my bride amen shining amen bright amen that's how he saw it that's how he saw you amen and when satan comes around amen and he's telling you all these lies that you can't make it that you're you're you're just the worst person in the world that that that you're just no good and look what you did yesterday and you're going to do it again tomorrow just just going to show them back the picture that god saw of you amen your picture is in the word where it says abroad without spot and without wrinkle that's me that that's my scripture amen praise god i'm his bride hallelujah amen so let's look for a moment uh examples in the bible of of people under pressure amen moses at the red sea in exodus chapter 14 you can read that the brother the brothers you can turn that off we'll come back to it here just a moment we see uh in the example there when moses was was commissioned they meant to get the people out of the the children of israel out of egypt and and they came out oh happy and rejoicing and god delivered us and then here comes the point where they got to the the red sea uh block it was blocking their way amen to continue through and and and moses didn't know what to do so he had pressure amen he had pressure from this side pressure from this side pressure in front of him and pressure behind him because the egyptians were right behind him i mean there was pressure north south east west on him goodness gracious i didn't want to be moses amen moses was chosen specifically for that purpose amen but can you imagine the pressure that moses fell on him and when and when and and he got to a point where that all that pressure and he didn't even know what to do and he was there crying and feeling the pressure and on top of that the people his the children who had just seen god i mean completely annihilating the egyptians i mean killing their firstborn and and and and flies all over the place and frogs all over their houses and none of that touched their house and here they are complaining about a big obstacle in front of them and and moses was the one receiving the breadth of all that the majority of i mean all that pressure that he felt right i mean that's that pressure cooker i mean it was getting ready to blow right there amen but you know he was like lord what am i supposed to do i got these i got this is what you call me to do what am i to do and god i told all that god told him was just stand still stand still don't try to figure it out don't try to don't try to do it your way or what you learned last year or what you learned two years ago or what you think it might be just stand still and let god have his way lord stand still and see the salvation of god amen and he told him amen put out the rod amen and he put out the rod and we we know the story the seed that's he parted and they crossed on dry ground amen amen relief the pressure he might sure when moses got to the other side i'm sure oh god thank you amen he probably wanted to get his sister's tambourine and just dance along with her amen glory his sister was the one amen using the tambourine he probably got in there with him that's right you see i'd i'd be right there with her amen after a pressure event like that amen your your homework young people isn't that kind of pressure now no amen you're you're you're you're us parents sometimes you know our our children may not be doing what we want them to do it that's not that kind of pressure amen it's pressure amen but moses had some pressure on him amen we saw we also see if you you can read that in exodus chapter 14. i encourage you to and also in genesis chapter 39 we see the pressure that was put on joseph amen by potiphar's wife to lay with her that's a pressure it was a sexual pressure amen potiphar's wife liked him or at least lusted after him and and and and he could he could have done it and nobody maybe would have done anything saw anything or heard anything or potiphar would never maybe found out but he feared god so much amen he said i cannot do this i cannot do this because for one amen i'm serving potiphar this and you're his wife and most and foremost i'm served a god amen who's my true master amen when you put god first as your true master amen no matter what pressures come on you amen because sexual pressure is a strong thing i mean we see it everywhere nowadays sexual pressures everywhere man go online and add just showing you an ad there'll be a sexual pressure right there completely change your thought process and you were just looking for a sermon to listen to the satan i mean we see those pressures everywhere sexual pressure joseph had them and there was no internet back then but he had a physical pressure amen to do something but he put god first amen he put god first put god first in your life remember always put in front of you what he did for you joseph didn't even have something like that to look to he didn't he didn't think oh jesus died for me on the cross of calvary and i i i owe my life to him look at all the pressure that he went through at the garden of gethsemane i can't do this he didn't even have he didn't even have a bible to look at amen and yet he was able to withstand temptation amen how much more you and i amen with the grace and the mercy and the word of god and the eleven hundred messages that we have there is no excuse when sexual pressure comes into our in our heart i know it's hard and i know it it's it's very present because we're humans and we're uh joseph was just as much human as we are but you have something to lean on you have something to look to amen run go take a cold shower do something that's what my mom told me just go take a cold shower [Laughter] do something to get get out of that because you start sitting there feeding that that's it brother you're going to fall and you're going to be condemned and then and then you're not going to want to come to church you're not going to fellowship with people why because i don't feel worthy i'm just being honest with you don't look at me that way you guys are just as much joseph as i was yes that's just how it is but joseph did it without the holy ghost how much more with the holy ghost amen so there was pressure there sexual pressure we also see queen esther and then she had pressure regarding the destruction of her people you can read that in esther iv you know she had pressure upon her there was an edict that went out that the hebrews were going to be uh destroyed they were going to and and there was a pressure mounted upon her mordecai was telling her uh uh hey esther there's something you've got to intervene for your people and so there was that pressure on her and she took the right decision she said hold on a second you see she said we're just going to cut fast for three days i believe it was three days and let's and and and let let's stand still and see the salvation of the lord that's exactly what she did what moses should have done amen esther did right away amen and when you stand still sometimes things come to your life and you don't know what to do amen just hold on wait it out don't don't react let's wait it out because god has a better a better way of resolving things than if we if we do if we just lash out and quickly say things or do things you see oftentimes we do the wrong thing when we do it out of out of out of uh yeah the spur of the moment most of the time our decisions are not the right decisions but if we just hold on stand still three two one one two three what in the world is bothering me three two one one two three what in the world is bothering me you just repeat that about five times and you oh okay i can wait this out [Laughter] now you can go home and you can repeat that and then you practice that and three two one one two three what in the world is bothering me just keep repeating it and it'll help you [Laughter] amen and you know what esther's people amen they were it wasn't the exact result that she wanted but god did something for them god allowed for the hebrews amen to take weapons and fight back and you know what they overcame their enemy amen and then we also know the very famous one amen daniel chapter 3 you can read about the three hebrew children amen shadrach meshach and abednego they were pressured to worship amen nebuchadnezzar's image and they said no i'd rather worship god amen amen what a stance that they took they didn't have a bible they didn't have the holy ghost in their life all they had was what they learned from their parents what they took from is from from israel amen and and and they said no we're going to stand and worship our who we've been taught to worship our true living god amen and and and and and they no matter what the king said they were respectful to the king they said they said old king you know what do we we uh blessed are you king i believe is what they say something like that yeah live forever we respect you we respect you but we can't do this you see you don't have to get snappy you don't have to get you know do you know what we believe do you know that we serve the god of of israel do we i mean they were quickly gone into that oven amen and not with a with the right attitude not with the right heart but you see they had a right heart about it amen amen and we know the end story amen because they took they were pressured amen and all that pressure went in them even in the oven even at the at the doorway of the oven that pressure was upon them and i can just imagine amen i wonder if they even saw that fourth man as they were walking in the oven the fourth man was already telling them you just come on okay fire all around them amen it doesn't matter what pressures you're going through saints it doesn't matter what happens in your life you could be at the point of death amen but say jesus is telling you come on i got this i'm here to help you don't worry you're everything is under control because why you put me first and now it's time for me amen draw nigh unto me and he said and i will draw an eye unto you amen praise god amen so we need we need confidence and patience amen i like what hebrews says here in hebrews chapter 10 verse 35 it says cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward amen the enemy can't touch you amen he he can't touch you with for you know if you've been called to something in your life amen he he can't touch that calling in your life but he can make you try to lose confidence in in your calling and if he can make you lose confidence in your calling amen he's got you oh nobody likes me nobody nobody uh likes the way i preach nobody like amen that's that's sometimes as we us as preachers we go through that nobody heard anything that i said amen amen and your pr and probably the the person that you least expect amen got something out of that sermon amen i've been there done that i've got the t-shirt the mouse pad and the hat to go with it i've got to have confidence in what god has called me to do because i'm not doing it for you i'm doing it for him he's he's the one that i'm doing it for amen you're secondary but if i'm thinking hey lord i'm doing this for you then everything will go right cast not away there for your confidence which have great recompense of reward amen verse 36 says for you have need of patience amen it's important for the believer to have patience look look you have need of patience that after you have done the will of god you might receive the promise amen you have need of patience otherwise it wouldn't be listed here you have need of it and patience only comes by pressures temptations amen sufferings and things in your life not everything going honky-dory not everything being happy and everybody liking you because i guarantee you everybody will not like you and you should be okay with that amen as long as god likes me as long as god loves me and i know he does because he died for me amen he said he loved me this much to spread his arms amen on a cross and die for me amen i know he loves me and that's all that matters and what whatever anybody thinks or whether anybody says about me amen that's between them and god amen praise god jesus loves me this i know why because the bible tells me so amen praise god let me go a little quicker here persecution is a form of pressure amen we we we see there uh peter was under a certain pressure when they took jesus from the from the garden of gethsemane and they took him in uh into pilate and to pilots hollow into the hall there and they're getting ready to whip him and all that peter the bible says that peter followed to see what was going on and you can read the details of it there in john chapter 18 where and that's where peter denies jesus three times now peter was feeling the pressure he had already told the lord he told god he said i will not deny you even though jesus had told them you will deny me he's denying the word of jesus jesus the word peter's seeing all the miracles that took place in his life peter's seen jesus welcome water even he himself walked on water peter himself seeing great things for three and a half years jesus tells them peter you're going to deny me thrice no i won't lord you're wrong isn't that how we do jesus sometimes he says something to us about the word but we do it otherwise because we think we know better right and exactly peter came into that point where people started saying hey you were with him you are one of them second time no i'm not with him i wasn't with him i don't know who you are and then third time he starts cursing and what happens the crows and he fulfills exactly what jesus told me but you know what i like about it is there if you read there in luke the bible says they're in luke that jesus just turned over and just looked he saw when peter denied him three times if you go back and read in luke jesus says he just turned to him and look i can just imagine the look that jesus gave him it wasn't a look of sternness and see i told you see you were wrong no it was it was like don't worry i'm making a way for you don't worry remember remember peter i prayed for you all right amen praise god i don't think jesus was giving him a a a spiteful look amen and that's what caused peter to run and weep the bible says that he wept bitterly that's right amen i caused his repentance amen when you really look into the eyes of jesus and when you really look into his word and you realize who you are and what you've done amen to to to put him in that position that he's at amen that'll cause you a man to get down and repent and and and seek him with all of your heart but the reason why we don't do that and we think we don't need to do that anymore is because we're not looking to him on the cross anymore we're not looking to we're we're not thinking that it was our sins and it's our our daily failures that put him there amen when we start looking at him that way amen it causes us to have more of a repentant heart amen amen but branham says here so so so jesus so peter was had that persecution on him there amen that was a form of persecution that was falling upon him he was afraid of it because he didn't want to be found out that he was walking with jesus amen so brother brown says here in the in the message the third exodus are you still with me don't fall asleep the natural man the antichrist is growing now through politics he's already got the white house in religion he's got all the people so scrupled up sounds like 20 21 to me till actually they'd fall right for it and the denominational leaders practically every church that there is in the nation is already in the confederation of churches this was in 1963 when he said this ramses is growing and they're all uniting together and and that's what they'll have and what does what does it do it makes a power a beast just like the first one then there's a persecution coming upon all those who won't unite with it and the boycott i mean i believe we're coming to that shortly it'll be too late then you've already took the mark don't say i'll do it then you better do it now ramsey's was growing and he he's talking about ramses because he's comparing to ramses the the pharaoh in egypt when during moses time and moses god had moses doing something in his life amen while while moses while ramses was growing but then this is what he's going to say here but remember while ramses was growing into power in egypt god had moses in the wilderness he was growing too ramses had a political system god had a spiritual system under a prophet ready to come down to speak to the people amen so there's that that persecution amen saints we're i believe that that right now we're still facing good times sure i mean it's still good but but pressures are coming there are pressures coming little by little right now politically amen and are you gonna cave in or are you gonna stay with the word brother because it'll come down i mean they're they're they're making fun of christians i i was i was watching a thing just last weekend they were having some sort of prayer vigil and in colorado i think it was something like that and there goes uh the antifa group just throwing just throwing stuff at them and saying stuff like is this jesus of you gonna save you now and just and just being all people can't even have public prayer anymore now oh but that's just in colorado well you watch and it'll happen here too man amen that's just damn what's happening here well you watch it's happening it's happened it'll happen and when it does amen let's look back at what brother branham said about it amen and we'll realize it don't wait till then to get right with god don't wait till the ark door is closed to get right with god get right with god amen prepare to enter the ark amen before the ark door closes amen because by then it will be too late amen brother branham talks about a squeeze for the bride amen it's a squeeze it's a pressure that's coming upon us and that's in order to manifest that third pull in its fullness see brother branham said this and and the message looked away to jesus now remember there will never be an impersonation of that third of that and i put in parentheses third pull because that's what he was talking about because it can't be see it cannot be now it is it's an existence and i have i'm warned of this that soon right at this time now it's just happened so it could identify its presence among you see but it will not be used in a great way until this council begins to tighten up and he's talking about the council of churches and when it does when that does the pentecostals and so forth can almost impersonate anything can be done but when that time comes this is the only time that brother branham mentions the phrase the squeeze i was actually surprised i thought i would see that more but he references it to it in different times doesn't actually say the squeeze or squeeze but he talks about it but this is the actual only quote where he actually says does squeeze when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you've seen temporarily which is that third pool you've seen temporarily where it was that he manifested be manifested in the fullness of its power when you continue reading down in paragraph 49 he says here it's tightening and then when that time comes and the press comes to a place to where you're pressed out that means you can't be part of that of their group anymore because of what you believe and your stand then watch what i'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes watch the third pull then see and it'll be absolutely to the total loss but it will be for the bride and the church amen but what's going to cause that is going to be a pressure it's going to be a press brother brown i'm talking about oppressed you see we're mad well when you have olives and when you have grapes right they might be some little juice or a little oil might might be on the outside that's just temporarily that's just a little bit that's why brother branham was saying temporarily the third pool was manifested in his life you see in his ministry amen but it's gonna take a squeeze when you squeeze those grapes and when you squeeze those olives that's when the fullness comes out and i believe that's what we're seeing right now since it's starting that squeeze is starting amen upon us and not you'd never think that it was going to happen the way it's happening it's a political thing but it's supposed to eventually it'll it'll head down to more something more religious now more more spiritual see and if we can't stand firm on just the physical things how are you going to stand afirm when the spiritual more spiritual aspect of it comes amen if you deny christ amen when somebody at school asks you you believe that you go to that church how are you how are you going to stand when when the when someone's asking you what do you believe are you going to keep you're not going to worship here anymore we're going to close this church down unless you go ahead and sign this or do that or the other what are you going to do then if you can't say i'm a christian now do you see what i'm trying to say you can't handle the pressure now how are you going to handle that pressure then amen so amen praise god now let's look at something here real quick and then we're almost done amen the right away and the r and the wrong way to handle pressure amen praise god don't worry brother wait i'm not gonna [Laughter] this is the wrong way to handle pressure amen you know you know what happens i don't know if the brothers have a picture of it if you're if you if you got this soda can and that's what happens i wasn't going to do it here so don't worry we'll just show you a picture because all of you know exactly what would happen but this is like some of us sometimes you know we've got so much pressure in our life i'm in work and and and family and and and the pressures of everything that we have to do bills and everything like that and we got it so so bottled up and there's no outlet there's no way to let out that pressure you see in a can there's no way to let it out but brother tony says something wrong to me [Music] and he's he's all wet now i'm all drenched in everybody even the ones around you amen they're all drenched and it's a mess we're all sticky why because you were you were manifesting the wrong you were letting it out the wrong way you weren't in that closet with god the way you needed to be you weren't in the word the way you needed to be you weren't listening to the messages the way you needed to be amen praise god this is how some of us sometimes come to church all shaken up watching netflix youtube videos conspiracy theories [Music] brother i need you to take out the trash nobody can say anything to you what that's that's how it happens amen but we want to be like like like this and the brothers can put the next picture we want to be uh more like a pressure cooker you know because i mean there's there's pressure in our life you see we have pressures in our life every one of those of us have pressure amen but there's a control mechanism and that's the holy ghost right in prayer amen you see normally normally the pressure cooker i mean has a ring on the lid hey man it's a it's a rubber ring i was going to bring a pressure cooker here but my wife's like i don't think so yeah amen so so i had to just show you the picture this is the exact one my wife has but i told her i said you know what sweetheart i think i think i'm gonna take that pressure cooker i'm just gonna flop it on the on the pulpit just like that this is like i don't think so but anyways but a pressure cooker has that rubber ring under and that's not to let you know so pressure doesn't escape you know i mean it's to keep it all in because what cooks the food inside faster is the fact that there's a lot of heat and there's a lot of pressure it's like the pressure is bringing putting that heat further into that meat or that vegetable whatever i mean i remember when my mom she used to cook beans and uh and we always cook beans and pressure cookers and i remember in colombia you know we would be i would be she'd put us for a nap around noon time and you'd hear that pressure cooker i'd hear it in the kitchen and i said oh man we're gonna have some beans tonight and i said i hope i'm gonna put some collard greens in it too and i like beans with collard greens and some some pork in it and things like that since the trudy you remember that now but you see that little ch it's because there's a control valve you know that there's a there's a valve where where there's there might be pressure amen but there's a control mechanism where that pressure is coming out right you see i believe this should be how a christian should work right and man we got that ring under that amen that's we're sealed that's exactly right eternal life it's a ring right sealed amen but we have that avenue of prayer the holy ghost amen kind of control don't let it out too much don't let it you watch what you're going to say to brother such and such don't think that amen he said this to you hey man you just watch it amen because if there's not that control mechanism there to let out that pressure what happened so i don't know if some of you have had pressure cookers blow up before i've never seen it before but i've heard some some some uh bad things about it amen so there's a the control mechanism in our life that we should have amen don't be like that fanta can now it's the same i mean it's building the same pressures you know it's almost like it this is cold but uh amen but still have a control mechanism and god is the only one that can put that in you in your life the holy ghost the holy ghost is the only one that can control that foul mouth of yours that can control the temptations uh that you have in your life amen so that you don't heed them they can control the thoughts amen that that that come through you you're you can't do nothing about the thoughts amen but there's that the holy ghost can help you control those thoughts amen you're walking you're driving down the road amen you see a bad dressed woman you young man amen you don't need to look and sit there and stare you know you don't need to do that the holy ghost can control that that's right amen amen that's right the holy ghost can control that amen praise god you want to be a pressure cooker amen that's the right way to handle pressure amen so real quick and real quick quick six seven quick ways to cope with pressure and hardships i just kind of wrote this amen come back or or focus again on the mission and your purpose that you have when something happens in your life hardship or pressure amen just focus again what am i here for amen what why why am i doing this for amen and it'll help you refocus back again and not concentrate so much on the pressure right pray praise and worship god i mean when you when you just the world is just coming up on on you man just start singing singing don't sing under pressure by queen [Laughter] sing gospel music sing good music amen sing something that will don't look at me that way sing something that will benefit you amen and and that will help you have a right attitude amen others that others can see as well and and benefit from amen draw strength from god's word amen sometimes we want to go to dr dobson's book amen or something like that that's fine but amen god's word is the one that gives us i don't i have never read the word of god and think uh and not read something new that can help me amen there's always something new in the word to help me especially at the moment that i need it amen when that pressure of life is coming on you amen uh look for support from helpful fam helpful family members and friends helpful is the key do not go to your best friend who is always critical amen and who thinks that life is is is just is is just a mess and it's not worth amen and who's always depressed don't go to that person go to the one who's always joyful who's always amen do you see what the word of god says here who goes to church my goodness and who you know that has a good reputation amongst the people amen sometimes we need to find a place where we can just get to ourselves get along i mean sometimes being amongst people a lot that that builds a lot of pressure and we need to get get excited but sometimes husbands and wives need to do that right amen you know i can't you know i can't my wife and me we can't always be together you know i mean we'll get on each other's nerves i gotta get away i gotta go do my own thing for a little while she's gotta go do her own thing for a little while and that helps release out the the wiggles and the pressures and we come back together and we hug and we kiss we talk and we might eat sushi together laugh amen laugh look what the proverb says proverbs 17 22 says a joyful heart is a good medicine but a crushed spirit dries up the bones job says 8 21 says he will he will yet fill your mouth with laughter in your lips with shouting so if there was anything wrong with laughing or shouting then then job wouldn't have said that the word of god wouldn't have said that laughter is like a vacation amen an instant vacation i mean you want a vacation right away there it is just laugh have a good time some of us we need to to have a sense of humor loosen up amen that if you like being that way then that's that's up to you but express thanks to god for what you already had oh my that right there amen i'll get you a man oh i got this going on oh thank you lord that i i i could be out in the streets begging right now oh lord i got this pressure this homework i i got this test and this project that's due all on the same day but lord i i could be out there uh prostituting at 15 years old and so many girls are doing that right now and they don't even know who their parents are they don't all they're doing is they're serving somebody else you see i always look at the at the at what god has placed you right now amen amen express thanks to god amen and express it publicly amen amen that's why when you raise your hands and when you and when you lift your hands to god and at church when you're singing and those types of things that lets people know hey he or she is expressing thankfulness to god they've surrendered amen amen it shows a lot and you know what it encourages somebody else to do it as well especially when you young people do it that's right when i see young people doing it kaylee when i see you doing it when i see a bella i've seen all these other young ones that do it amen and i see that they're doing it with all their heart oh my it makes me feel condemned because i ain't doing it right man i got the young people beating me out worshiping me you see we should feel that way amen should make us ashamed because we need to be thankful for what we have amen praise god jesus at gethsemane amen he suffered that was one of the worst pressures ever that that right there was the worst pressure ever and we you can read that in luke chapter 22 we don't have time amen but the bible says there in verse 39 it says and he came out and went as he want to the mount of olives olives and that's where all all everything that that that that he could give was given right there he died before he actually died on the cross he died right there amen but watch in verse in verse 4 verse 43 and that's chapter and it says and there appeared an angel unto him from heaven strengthening him he's there praying and saying lord if if it if it be your will pass this cup from me i don't want to die i don't want to go through this suffering people are going to spit on me people are going to yank beard from my face i'm sure he's already seen all these things people are going to look what they're going to do lord i don't want to do this but lord not my will but thine will be done man it's not about me him being god he's saying it's not about me it's about those that i'm dying for it's about you it's about you it's about you it's about me amen that's why he did it amen amen and being in agony watch when he was in agony three times he went back to pray and seeing his disciples sleeping you know and he just went back to prayer amen and then being in agony the bible says there he prayed more earnestly right so even when more pressure was coming on him what did he do the bible says he prayed more earnestly all right it's not time to slack oh god ain't answering my prayer well i'm gonna go and watch netflix no you pray even harder because if god the god of heaven had to do that how much more you and i especially in the hour that we're living in where we're facing uncertain things i'm telling you our lives are not going to be the the the same hunky-dory way that it's been in the last few years we're about to face some tough time saints and it's time for us to now pray more earnestly i've been trying to dedicate myself more to more prayer a more personal prayer i love i love what brother trevor was saying the other day when he came and speak spoke for us that that that thing about you know now lay me down to sleep and five-minute prayers that's not gonna that's not gonna help you when that time comes and it's common sense that is not going to help you it's time you feel that agony amen it's time to get an agonizing prayer say lord i can't do it on my own but lord i'm willing to go through this because even this pressure is being cooked put on me amen but i know something good is going to come out on the other side amen praise god and brother branham says it says it's been proven through the ages that persecution strengthens the church amen it's been proven through the ages that persecution strengthens the church are you ready for persecution if you can't handle some little persecution now how are you going to handle it here in a few in a few years it could be a few months i don't know right next week maybe and there's a quote somebody said pressure can burst a pipe or pressure can make a diamond yep right that's how it's you decide how you want the pressure to be amen you want it to be like this or you want it to be a pressure cooker with some control it's okay to have pressure don't feel bad that there's pressure in your life it's
