that and now just deliver us completely and help us to walk in you we love you we thank in Jesus name Amen okay first Peter 1:18 for as far as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from there your vain conversation received by tradition from your father's when I read that scripture you might not think about the way that I do what I think like for as much you know that we were redeemed from the corruptible things as silver and gold and all the Vanka and thus don't bring it on over into a new testament part and try to make tongues as the evidence i shouted i cried i spoke in tongues the trying to make it something like that I mean that's the way I think and I'm sorry I just put out what I think okay but what our view but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot Hoover Li was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these life's times for you who by him do believe in God now it's only by him now we're gonna get into it after a while we'll talk about how that your faith becomes his faith and only is it worth anything okay who by him to believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in God seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not a corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth forever now that scripture has a two-fold meaning it means being born again you are you know you your being won't you come into the new birth all right but then you grow in the growth development of a movement of being born again okay now let's go to 2nd Peter 1 Simon Peter servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of him as to the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power watch now hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness how through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises brother Brennan said these promises all right that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust wonderful people written to now watch and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge you may be seated the Lord that is blessing as I've always said to you it says add to your faith it doesn't say add to your knowledge add to this or that is always the faith all right now we've come up to a position and I'm going to express something here for a few minutes to let you know where I stand what I believe and I believe the Bible will back it up and I believe the prophets message will verify it but there are so much as the Prophet we gave you where he said you know he said the Holy Ghost is so been missed out huh see and everybody's got this kind of a Holy Ghost got this kind of hold ago you got this new birth you've got that born-again experience you've got all kind of things in the religious realm of mankind and having those things it has produced a lot of things I remember even in this message in the early years sitting and listening to ministers try to explain how they was a difference in the kingdom of God in the kingdom of heaven you know and just running is so great people their glory that would just look at that difference I just don't see any difference you know I just didn't and that's why Vall said to you I always told it to you I believe in three stages phases the Prophet said Oh grace justification repenting of your sins sanctification cleanse and set aside and the baptism of the Holy Ghost to give you the new birth all right now you don't get the new birth that justification you're not born again at justification you get when you come to the new birth is when you come to the baptism of the Holy Spirit which is to say I am born again I've taught you that from the beginning I believe the born-again experience the new birth and the baptism of the Holy Ghost is one of the signs you said well I'll break it down this way we'll let you break it down all you want to I just stay with what I am and the way I stand all right so it's been so missed talked and brother Brennan said there was 900 different ways of the denomination seeing it and I've always said there's probably a thousand the way the people of this message you seen it because there was a big doctrine back years ago and it was labeled as the no Holy Ghost doctrine all right in that hold it no Holy Ghost doctrine what they taught was that you got to come all the way up to where it says Holy Spirit before you're even born again now that was the way they taught it a lot of you heard it all right but I'm just saying it that way that that's what it is that they've told it that way all right now a church without a doctrine is not a church all right out I've always contended as I said that it takes justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost to be the new birth all right no that's as simple as I can make it okay now then I've always believed then that after when I heard the prophets message and then I heard the doctrines contrary to it as we will read a lot - not from the Richardson why didn't you just print the whole book the statue of a perfect man we've done a pretty good job in and holding it all right but now listen I believe the prophets message and the Bible teaches that you're born again I'm gonna put it all out and then we'll come back by you're born again at faith all right so then you've got justification you're not in the body you got sanctification you're not in the body then you come to faith and you're in the body anybody that studied pyramidology Zoar anything if you want one I've got a book at home that will show you down below this bottom line is like two things and one of them is called the upside down chamber so anything down below there's all out of theater all right I believe that the Bible the prophet and everything teaches that we're born again at faith and then by the opening of the word will bring us to the position to where it says the Holy Spirit all right and that's where I've told you that under there Pentecost there was a split condition that happened on the day of Pentecost 120 in the Upper Room received the Holy Spirit brother Branham says statue of a perfect man the disciples had these virtues he said they didn't have the headstone but they had two virtues all right where were they at right here born-again Holy Spirit these virtues why because they'd been tutored and trained for three and a half years all right but see then the 3000 outside only heard one message they had no teaching no basics all right so when the Holy Ghost fell it gave them the new birth but it didn't put them up here where the fathers were that it put him here at faith the new birth you're gonna say they didn't get the new birth you in that safe if you do because you're gonna destroy your old Bible and that's why I've always say it in that way you can understand brother Branham retrun said I've met people that had the baptism with the Holy Ghost just like the day of Pentecost before he ever come on the scene see the ones that are saying no Holy Ghost doctrine they say that's incorrect it's you're you're all out of caters and all that they say you got to turn your pyramid upside down because you got to put the Holy Spirit they just don't understand being born again they don't understand the message the Prophet brought of adoption adoption is what born into the family but your tutor training and thing starts when you're born again and you come to the stature of a perfect man all right now that's that's what I say now at least tell you what I believe ain't go Peter Pan around you well yeah yeah oh yeah that was where I'm nobody and now I believe that no I don't know you're gonna hear it one line if you don't like it that's up to you I have no problems I've discussed this and lamps with people to try to get an understanding No and I believe it I believe that the three thousand outside received the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth born into the body of Christ but he did not put him where the apostles were he put him right down here at the new birth huh now when we read the scripture called we read it here but a run says Peter was saying I have this faith and I'm addressing this to them that have the like precious faith and I gave you a bunch of quotes our Sunday about the I believe it was Sunday wouldn't everyone anyhow were run around used like twenty six times where he spoke of like precious faith and talking about it being the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know of like precious faith he said Timothy had like precious faith he said Perry green and like precious faith come to Tucson to started the church he puts the like precious faith no so then what we're doing see by reading it this is not written we're going to quote these in a minute we're gonna read them this second Peter is not written to the world now first Peters not the Bible is not written to the world it is written that they can that mankind can read it and become under conviction but it's written to those that are in Christ Jesus who have the new birth all right see that's why they couldn't understand brother Branham he said that's where you Pentecostals failed he says you're born again and he said you thought you got everything he said you just got to the stage of starting that's why they couldn't follow him that's why they can't read the statue of a perfect man the people of this message that's that's message has been argued over and over one plate this way one believes that way one I don't want message but I don't understand I don't understand mankind and they're doing I understand we are humans and I understand that until all you know until we get the faith of God we're in bad shape I ran this off brother branham said have faith in God how many times you think he said down 1017 times he said the quote have faith in God I thank you much to meant what he said don't you alright now let's get on the end result and pick up so you understand what I'm saying now I believe you're born again at faith right here your justification and sanctification is below the pyramid you come up to faith and then virtue or knowledge temperance place of godliness brotherly kindness and where it said the Holy Spirit that's just the faith of the father's because brother Branham said it now you you won't it we couldn't get him to pull up in there they can run it off for you in a hurry to find out he said the headstone has not come yet the disciples never got the headstone they got to faith of the fathers but they never got to hit stone show me in the prophets message that they ever got that well they got the Holy Ghost that's true but they've more to the Holy Ghost than just say old it goes there's a growth development that has been missed by mankind that was in the Bible that was there with the Apostles in sight and the Prophet talked that as I said to you he didn't just start teaching these things in the you know in the sixties he's mentions adoption in 19 and 50 he goes to here you him on adoption in 55 I've asked you to read the messages Intervale or however you know the messages that gave you some messages to listen to that you can see back dire that he was teaching back there the fact that mankind needed a growth development not to be satisfied that's where he preached the whole message where Peter calls failed there's a whole message of that and that message was to describe to them where they had missed it he said yes born into the family we see I've been growing I've been growing haven't you I've done a lot of this way I thank after 50 years of the Prophet leaving the scene if you don't know more today then you knew when he was here then the altar is open you need the new birth now I was looking at a quote that brother Branham said to something like this cause this was kind of the way brother Perry grant my brother Henry Green said it God started his church the way he wanted it he wants his church the way he started right he started his people what has been the foundation for this whole message he started with Adam and Eve and according to the message blasphemous name he gave into the nostrils of Adam eternal life is yeah but I got in the steelbook where he said that Adam fell from eternal line show me where he fell from eternal life show me where he fell - did he fall to hell did he miss it all no way now you you've got he fell from the fact that he never reached eternal life in body that ought to be plain sense without any revelation he might beat you over the head with they never reached the position all right the church he's got to come back to that because according to the Prophet what all that Adam lost Christ has come to redeem all right we would have come to the Tree of Life protecting the Tree of Life and been made eternal in body and spirit but we fell for we got to the church started out on the defini coast with the new birth in there born-again experience in the soul and that's what God build his church on and that's where it's been ever aged it's been that new birth but you lost the channel his weight was bringing out Sunday afternoon so you lost the channel when you come on up through you know Paul I rainiest Martin Colombo right in there you begin to deteriorate away and Luther come out of it with the just shall live by faith the Trinitarian smoking a pop drinking his beer yeah because it wouldn't anybody to condemn me but when he got to measure do the just shall live by faith restoration was coming now I said coming because you got to be careful because the just shall live by faith brings you to Reformation Luther was Reformation Wesley was Reformation but the Pentecostal Azusa Street wouldn't Reformation it was the birth all right let's get on to it then so what have we been talking about now some how do you understand what I say and what our teach and what I believe all right now but if you're coming to me to talk to me about it I want you to bring your books and your Bible don't just come up so well brother Taylor I think you're wrong right here I want to know why that you're saying now if you're willing to say you think I'm wrong you ought to be willing to try to show them wrong but you know what then I've got to put it to the basis if you show me I'm wrong I can be corrected try to worry about it I'm gonna win either way because if I'm proved wrong I can win by getting away from my wrong but are you willing to put it on the line you better be willing you better know where you're at we ain't gotten a long time to start trying to figure out where raft right I think we better get serious about the message all right now listen so just back up to where we're at to review just a higher know this quote quote quote and run on so what is the new birth now the birth of the word is Christ now don't pull these up because we're on 1 2 3 they won't start till about number 5 or 6 all right that's the spoken word is regional see also this message that in spoke already written OC to be born of the word and spirit brings us back to the spoken word again like in John 3 in other words the same thing to Nicodemus what's now to be born to the water and of this and the spirit what does it do and it brings us right back again unto the place of were you should have been at the beginning takes you right back now there's a quote on over in write a while I'm gonna get to it the Reverend said I never saw that he brings out something close to that and he said but I never seen that he hadn't called it to write to him seem to be born of the word and spirit takes us back like we should have been without a fallen condition all right so that's what I'm contending for that kind of a new birth not I cried spoke in tongues shouting Allah wonderful we believe in all of that there's nobody in this building believes an emotion more than this man I've talked to you about it I smelt the presence of God I'm done all things I don't have to worry about it that's not to try to make anything differences be truth listen what a brother runs safe what is the new birth brother branham cross the mystery it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you not you said ik redundant or doctor or anything we joined a church or shook a hand but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody else says what takes place it's Christ see pastors priests or whatever it whatever it might its Christ in you that is the revelation that the church was built upon Christ in you he said no to her I didn't know it would build on Jesus now come on do we need to get into that didn't know how far do we need to explain it's not like the Catholic they believe it was all in Peter and it's not like a apostles it was all in Christ it's what is Christ in you Christ in you the hope of glory right all right it's Christ being revealed and he is the word and when the word is it revealed it expresses itself when it's revealed what is the new birth didn't revelation in Jesus Christ how do you get born again patmans vision for you can only be it can only be known by revelation and you can only be saved by revelation he said you have a head knowledge of it intellectually but you can't be saved until it's revealed to you no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost right but you see where I get into that I say things to people you talking about me you're against me cause you you know I'm a little you know that I'm a little emotional am I thinking praise God I wish we were all emotional I wish we were running however time I remember when brother ray used to run miles no remember so other brother was done that letter one day this this brother was preaching it and his brother came around and and this brother was standing there and he watched him make one circle around in the church and he started the second I said he'll never make the third one when he came the third time the brother was right behind him and if they'd made four I guess I'd have been behind the inventor all right God I believe in it I don't believe you put it first I believe you put it we're supposed to be faith is a revelation from God now we're picking up kind of where we're getting to what faith is a revelation okay now what is it it gives give you by the grace of God and God reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation and the whole Church of God is built upon the revelation but it's like I've tried to explain see it's people want to stay on the simplified matter and I try to make it so simple that's why I said I believe the new birth the born-again experience the baptism with the Holy Ghost is all the same and it's the experience you go through we see you said well I can see the birth and I can see the born-again but I like to see the baptism coming down let's show it to them in the Bible that's all I've ever asked according to the profit and the dividing of the pillar of fire was the tongues of fire that was sitting on each one of them in the upper row you see right then right then in that upper room was fulfilled a major portion of the scriptures that Jesus spoke because he said when he the Holy Ghost has come he'll bring to your remembrance whatsoever I say it and teach you things to come I said that's a quote add it on to it but that's the way the Prophet wrote you didn't teach you things to come what is it go ahead and number six we've done these the other day but I want it all together where we'll understand he said the rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her that the revelation the true Bride of Christ will be waiting for the revelation of the rapture so the rapture is a revelation as I saying then it's hard to think about the new birth being a revelation but why not why not think of it is it not true that God spoke to you and called you now remember the Bible says you're not called you can't come and that's the father calling you right it's not you coming he's him calling you all right they speaking to you then when he quickens to you that new birth is that making alive that word that you have heard how much simpler can it be yeah but I wanted to baptism coming floating why why Cannot you believe what a prophet said look that's a revelation where revelation is faith and you cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith is revelation because there's something that's revealed to you faith is a revelation faith is something that has been revealed to you like it was to Abraham that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him as though it wasn't so now faith that's what faith is it's the revelation of God the church is built upon him a revelation of God so you know what the new birth is God revealing himself to you how much more simpler can it be how much more simpler can it be made than to say the new birth is God revealing himself to you we get them called deep I'm calling this that and the other people don't under they don't understand is that I can't understand brother Dale he's so far out for how her and what's more simpler can that be you remember this from how faith in God go ahead to number seven he's talking about faith it's also an experience faith is an experience come on over to my subject how faith in God now we are taught in God's blessed word that faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of the Lord of God word of the word is now faith is also an experience then he puts an experience back into your life as the things happening to you see and many times faith is had my former experience makes faith grow a former experience will make faith grow I thought we believe in growing up in him I thought that was what we're for oh no we're just here to speak in tongues shout and have a good time and many times faith is had by former experience makes faith grow faith being the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things that's not seen so many people fail to find the real meaning of what faith is some people believe that faith is some sensation or some emotion but the Bible said that faith is the substance of things hoped for it's just an experience to you that's why you're being born again it's an experience that's taking place in your in your soul well some things it's mental conception of the word but that's not right faith is a substance faith is not a myth say faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence what to have an evidence it must be of substance if you've got an evidence as to what your Holy Ghost is and it's not a substance what have you got you got mythology's you got mental conception shortly speaking in tongues crying Allah we believe in every bit of that but remember Satan can't impersonate every one of them and brought around sanity even pies out supernatural gifts so don't go into all of the guilts and all of this that Miller I know I'm saved because of that your gift to get anyway it'll work but it'll get in your way why call he will take you away from the word so if your evidence is not a substance now then my evidence is what the prophets say it's whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word if it denies the word there's no substance but you've got the greatest substance in tahrir because you've got faith that's the substance of God's Word anchored in your heart by you accepting Jesus Christ as your Savior and much more simple look it's not something that your imagine in your mind it's something that you absolutely you have it's something that you possess in your own being now I admit I admit to one time because a lot of people's never had a substance faith experience maybe something that you knew was right and real and going to take place but nobody else would believe you if you ever really had a substance faith something that you knew you were healed it didn't make no difference what took place you got worse that's what's supposed to be if you ever had something that's just a substance that nobody can take away from you now we got one in here where brother Ron said faith is the substance of the fact that something that God says gives you a right to confess you have it when you don't even hold it right there God gives you a right to say it listen oh here it is and what is it it's the evidence of things that you have hope for it's the evidence of things that you do not have as yet but you have the authority of God to say that you have it listen Church I've tried to say this over and over people I know what does saith the Lord he is and I know what but you know what this Bible is dust saith the Lord you know this Bible says by stripes I'm healed that's thus saith the Lord yeah but we only believe it's for the profit well that's where you're in bad shape because it'd probably be the only one who can get born again it's not something that you just kind of a push yourself to I've noticed so much of that in my meetings that people try to work themselves up into something to make them believe now you can't do that you just beaten the iron but faith is something that you're just as calm and settled as it can be it's taking God at His Word and having the assurance in your heart that God is able to keep what he has said that he would do and will perform anything that he said he would do what are you why would you even think about well you see I'm I'm preaching to you that here but also I'm on the Internet you know this goes around the world at one time we were 156 countries we're viewing in wouldn't you be afraid to get up here and say what you believe no I'm not I'm not a bit of right I have no problem cuz I believe he's been proven to be true so what I worry about it but if he stands one time in a position to her that you knew something they're going to take place and there's no way that anybody talked you out of it you'll find out what a substance really is okay what's now taking God as his word on the adulterated faith is what taking God is his word okay did we get through a revelation is faith all right let's go on over I know I read these Sunday but I want you to listen to what say it listen what brother Brown says on earnestly contended number eight my brother it's my faith you're saved that right but listen in accepting of your faith God confirms your faith by the baptism of the Holy Ghost now he confirms your faith other words he mouths at this way you can say well I've accepted Jesus Christ I've accepted Jesus Christ brought around made a statement one day that told us all through loophole didn't it because he said has God accepted you he said you can accept him every day in other words in misery but it has he accepted you if he's accepted you you don't want to worry about a fight I don't mean you know everything but you want to worry about it God confirms your faith by the baptism of the holy God if you say you believe and you don't get the baptism of the Holy Ghost then you do not know what it your faith isn't accepted in the sight of God if you don't get it when you say you got it and you take God at His Word and say I've got two baptism when the Holy Ghost look what you better be anchored on you're saying what God said we're going to get to that mental faith in a minute look your faith isn't accepted in their side of God you've got a mental faith instead of a heartfelt faith that's right when you truly believe God gods under obligation to pour the Holy Ghost on you and then if he does pour that Holy Ghost on you you said well I've got the Holy Ghost - well if you do you're bound to believe in that super net in the supernatural signs and wonders because you're added to it that's the truth now people of the message believe brother Branham had supernatural signs and wonders right we know that I mean that's no problem but what about you what about a statement read a random made he said in the Bride of Christ one day will be the Ministry of Jesus Christ well no that was in brother Branham big man in this message they didn't going on I'm going off on says he isn't I heard him say this statement he said that the third pool was for Jesus Christ and brother Branham but was not for you anybody else now that was the man's word at the third pool now according to what I heard the prophets say he said so much contrary to that man until that man not even they said because you know what he said he said the third pool is far the bride listen and the church for the bride and the church now what is the end charge that's gonna have to be foolish virgins insane cuz that's not bride right he said into the totally lost well I just I just don't believe I just don't believe that then we have it like bread around I've explained that to you over and over and over around the world tonight the Ministry of Jesus Christ is being made manifest put it all together you've got the Ministry of Jesus Christ not in one person no we're not looking for that that's what's caused all this running after these new ones that come out with doctrines and this one and that one in that one and everybody run i from me never run I just won't down the road just come down the road you know like I like what somebody said just let it let it run its course okay let's go let's go a little further let's go to this one I love blasphemous night and look what he says the biggest part of our faith is mental faith now I see two facets has always been in the message maybe other would better words are saying but two things I see a people who on one side said we've got everything we got everything we got everything I see the other side wind got everything we got nothing that reminds me of the about the writing of the cheque but no money in the bank you know if we could get that together it might work but look the biggest part of our faith is mental faith by hearing the word it brings us to a mental recognition of God Hey look but if this coming from above old brother if it ever strikes this there's a godly super spiritual faith now what's he talking about but this coming from above when you get born again that's what I believe it you have a connection to the headstone you have a connection to all of these virtues in the faith of the father and you have a connection to the edge stuff what is calling you what is calling you is to a deeper depth the day you were born again it made your contact with God and he's drawing you is that not a growth development is that not child training is that not adoption is not all of those things a prophet called feeding into that look then what does that faith do if your mental faith something happens to it because of spiritual faith then what does that faith do that faith recognizes only the word okay no matter what anything else says it can only recognize the word because in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the was God and the word is still God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and when the word itself is pouring into our faith our mental faith becomes a spiritual revelation now remember we're not going to get there not cut on the way but remember read Peter add to your faith so when the Holy Ghost unites with mankind or the word he's pouring into our mental faith becomes a spiritual revelation you start with a mental faith I wish to God right now that the part I have in my mountain in mental part of me you know what is mental I wish it was revealed I don't believe it is I'm not honest I don't believe everything I read and instead is revealed to me I want it revealed but I also know that even after we leave this world the prophets said they'd be a message of cheer after the endless ages was over we'll have a wonderful time learning because we only have the carnality of mine okay all right look and oppose this foundation I'll build my church not upon a mental conception of Church corny joining a mental conception of that but upon the revelation when them streams of grace you remember the message sister shepherd's dream the water was running the Holy Spirit you know the master pouring the message in up to talk we'll get back to that and running down those streams coming outside Larry and the streams of grace is poured into that mental faith that you've got then upon this a spiritual revelation I'll build my church and the gates of Hell can't prevail against it see that shows they would be against it but it will never prevail oh what a glorious thing let's see the faith the five strings okay go ahead Oh number two him taken from blasphemy as tonight then that was number one number one coming to you your mental faith now look he's teaching the statue of a perfect man who's by famous night are you familiar enough with the quotes and the time to know that's what he's doing this is priest after the statue of a perfect man he's preaching it again and showing the thing okay are we with me you with me number one coming to you your mental faith right here comes the Holy Spirit coming down into your mental faith making it a spiritual revelation is not to love the headstone which is God Christ the Holy Ghost it's coming down through these things pulling you upward it's just it's a pull in your spiritual faith only recognizes the world and number two three then you'll high spiritual you'll be having the Holy Spirit and we'll steal all these things into you as that Holy Spirit covers this from your faith up to the Holy Spirit shields you in with Christ then you become one so that's what happens here as each one of these virtues is added they're sealed in a sealed entity then the headstone comes as a final seal of all things all right now listen he goes to Peter who pull it out where we can read where you get it in my so listen Simon Peter serve it an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith now who's he writing to to them that have obtained like precious faith this is not written we'll read on down to you're not written to the world it's written to the church those that are in Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior all right go ahead on on down now wait a minute you got to get to know you have to get the number two well I'm telling you come on down there go to number 12 starting on the statue of a perfect man which took us from how many what 26 weeks and we've got here it's been 26 or 28 sermons that said let us read Simon Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that I would thank like I like the way that stated right there because my whole subject this morning is based on faith okay let me read that again it only comes to like precious pain precious faith now notice listen to notice he is saying that I have obtained this faith now he said he had that faith and I'm addressing this to them that has obtained the like precious faith I won't it's not to the outside world this is to the church those that are in Christ let's say a moment ago maybe didn't clear don't know the Bible is not written to sinner's they can't comprehend it the only thing a sinner can learn from the Bible is head knowledge and he can learn that God wants to save him but he's got to get a revelation look now you know and just go to that we can take a whole message on that part teaching what divine nature the stature of a perfect man is teaching the divine nature of Almighty God add to your faith virtue or knowledge template page regardless that's the divine nature of Almighty God look what it says see the world you escaped we've escaped that now he's addressing this to the church that's why we're here this morning is to find out what is the way what is God's requirement there's not a person in here that don't want to do that and he told my sister kidding them want to be close what is your heart's desire it'll be closer to God when you learn a Christ there's something about him that makes the soul loving you just try to get right into him yeah all right what do we got next off the message all the days of our life to show he's bringing adoption bring it on up this was preached in 59 okay 59 612 before he preached the statute of perfect man in 62 or 61 look what he said then it would become a slave to Jesus Christ to serve Him in love and you my brothers and sisters who are like precious faith who's been born of the Holy Ghost this had the blood of Jesus Christ to sanctify and cleanse you from all the filth of the world that died daily to the flesh crucified putting it away and become a slave in your own body to serve God look for a CD 59 he knew about precious faith he didn't start out preaching I mean didn't have to wait Lee got to 65 to preach the statue of a perfect man he was a prophet you remember what I say it you remember the message the other day you see you can bring the statue of a perfect man and the faith of the fathers now not the headstone code it ain't come yet so you forget that you can bring the faith of the fathers through for ages dying in the fourth one going away in the fourth age 50 age six to age seventh age you don't have the revelation of Jesus Christ you have a Trinitarian doctrine and you have a Zeus's Street with we got everything when we believe that ain't much more than us Baptist which was about a hundred or so years before then we got everything when we believed sounded like some of the believers in the message on all right but listen and I go to number 14 statue of perfect man pray you make a phone call and say pray huh that contact and your faith brings God and listen to it's the thing that brings the prayer and God together on the scene prior faith changes from here to here now you know what he's talking about faith don't change from here to here faith changes from here right head knowledge mental faith to here heart heart faith we read there a minute ago changes from here to here it brings it okay brain only now faith does the rest of it faith does the rest so we must have faith for a foundation all Christianity oh you are and all you'll ever be is based upon faith in the word that reason that's the reason I believe the word look you must have faith for a foundation now what's your foundation then we're down under here you're upside down tonight faith is the foundation for everything faith is the foundation for everything that we all need up okay faith very simple little word faith it'll be all Christianity they remember remember what a priest twenty five thirty sermons starting in Genesis and what do we start talking about faith to believe God faith to believe God all the Old Testament salvation of whatever you brought it was based upon faith whether it be the offering of a lamb will be into what it was based upon faith to believe God well why would you want to change to something else when you started the church on the dip in account from faith you're not listening to what I said Adam and Eve started with eternal life all that was coming down and then you come over here with Jesus restore all things and on the day of Pentecost he restores eternal life back to the soul of mankind come on when I put my faith in his word is anchored nobody interpreting here it is thus saith the Lord and I believe that there's the basis everything is based upon faith where do we get to what was that 14 let's go to 15 the stature of a perfect man notice you must be born again and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith no that's right so you see on my chart here the drawing I got the very foundation of faith is the foundation this is what the church is built on faith revelation from God faith is the foundation of all of it for without faith it's impossible to please God he that cometh to God must believe that he is you might as well stay back in other words if you don't believe the word you're skeptic of the Bible and you're skeptic well I don't know where the Prophet mint is I don't know whether he meant this over here or what did he mean here or what has he do what he said you just might as well stay back right until what you might as well stay back until first you believe it what do you seeing I believe there's only two elements that controls the human being that's either doubt of faith one or the other you're possessed of the one that do not dominate your life just depends on how much faith you have how high you can rise but first it's got to be faith let me say on that foundation for a while now faith is what you must believe faith is what faith is the substance of things hoped for it's it's you already have it when you have faith you already got your substance because it's revealed in faith faith is the substance of things hoped for Hebrews 11 what kind of an evidence a holy evidence he says and watching it but actually believing you got it he's coming down and people are missing it actually believing that by His stripes you are healed there's nothing going to turn you from it but when you got faith you know it because it's the evidence foundation of all Christianity all salvation is based on faith in God that can I make a couple of this personal point cuz I got him over here and we'll get to it when I'm running late on there's a lot of difference in having faith in God than having the faith of God you with me you say well I've got faith in God a lot of difference in heaven the faith of God right if you got the faith of God what has happened we'll get down to this but look what he saying when your mental faith becomes a spiritual revelation see there's no longer your faith anymore you see his faith he's his thing he's coming lived in you he imparts his own life into you sure it belongs to you because he gave it to you now quote brother branham this is my I God gave it to me so don't run off with the wrong line when you receive that new birth when that soul is quickened to life by the baptism of the Holy Ghost from their own is his life in you that's why it only says at one time in their statute a perfect man it says add to your faith then it says add virtue add knowledge why because you got to put it on something that's why they couldn't understand brother Branham see I've been through this church this was the seventies and you know a lot of you was there but I wonder what she's listening to them well I poke for that brother he didn't say that I wish you would do me a favor I wish you would be just as picky about me and what I say as you're defensive about what the others have say it and coming let's talk about it coming let's sit down talk about because you cannot be born again without it being faith and that's the very foundation of all Christianity why brother branham take this message and do this it's in the statute of perfect man he said I just got the other day this scripture he earned the way it ties in that was 1962 yet he was teaching it the fifties probably the forties and we don't have the record of that but what's he saying where we're at go ahead go ahead to the next which is 16 first you must be born again and when you're born again you have faith you believe the word until you're born again you'll argue against it you're just religiously in kind and you've got a got a little human knowledge that you should do right you will never be able to agree upon the Word of God you'll never do it you've got to be born again and born again it produces faith all right then after you get faith this is right here if they ought to get faith then you're just in position of growing you know what a baby sure for nine months it's doing pretty good girl but it really when does it start its growth as a baby when it exits a mother's wound and it becomes a living soul so he says now a lot of people go up to the altar pray and say Lord forgive me and watch him and a great experience of sanctification comes upon them and thing then you have a great time get up to the older shouting you go back saying bless God I got it no you just started to a place where you can grow you're not born again you just started to play you ain't done nothing you have to the only thing you've done is just laid the foundation when you get the Newburgh you just laid the foundation now when we get into adoption with it to worry that a baby that's born into a family right it's a child the day it's born it's full inheritance everything is settled the day it's born but it's got to grow into it and come to a position to the adoption an adoption is really not a Jewish thing adoption come through from the Romans I thank you truck but it was brought over into the to the Jews they wasn't actually the one that first brought in the adoption all time they incorporated it because it was right it was in the word it was right and they know it's right okay watch them now you're going to build a house and you pour the foundation say boy I got her see you got the foundation to build your house on now you got to build a house you got it by faith your new birth you filled into the kingdom your soul is eternal isn't it ever been but you've got to build the body of Christ because you're just born into it you pour the foundation there's where the thing comes in this morning we got to talk about now all right a house this foundation is first what is the foundation of Christianity faith in the Word of God that's your foundation then you begin to grow then you start you begin to add to this foundation well we got go ahead 17 not you're a perfect man come on Richard said you already read the whole book I've asked you to ain't gonna ask for a raise of the hand to see how many listen to the tape or read the book it would be your embarrassment not mine got one this willing just stuck his hand up that's dirty but is it true I mean you're gonna go to school the teacher tells you what to take for the next day you're gonna have a test I think it stood in there I already know it I know as much about if she does the next day you get a flunk right that's what my niece come home from school one day and told my brother she said you wouldn't never believe what I got today said I had a test said you wouldn't believe what I got he's what you get he's in a big old goose egg she made of zero okay my family's all mister but listen and your faith brings God now listen you won't know what to do your faith brings gone it's the thing that brings the prior and God together on the scene now we've done read this one back over but it's reread it prior face changes from here to here it brings together speak the word all I want you to do is say the word and everything is alright faith does the rest of it go ahead 18 that was a repeat we don't have time for repeats we're going to eat day now here are still statue a perfect man now here's what we do what's the first thing you have faith and be born again that's laying the foundation then after you lay the foundation secondly you add to your foundation add to your faith Peter says here add to first you how faith then you add virtue to your faith this is the next column first pour your foundation faith then to your faith add virtue okay go ahead is that still poor to go into 19 try to close it up well that's the way it is trying to manufacture Christianity you can't do it the first thing you've got to do is be born again you've got to be changed when you're changed you become a new creation now you're getting right now you don't have to worry about the feathers I love this one it'll take care of itself when you're born again when a statement attorney said it automatic you see that's on 19 they says it automatically added all right let's get we got more of that Jesus said it come on man be born again and he can't even see the kingdom and that means he means to understand he can't do with that okay go ahead let's pick up the lights too and we'll call it quits this is from why I'm against organized religion this the state but I want you to get from it oh this is priest in 62 right in with a statue of perfect man when God says come to be born and they say come join see when the baptism of the Holy Spirit is falsely took over for a wafer in the Catholic Church a handshake in the Protestants and emotion in the Pentecostal church instead of the person of Christ coming in with all that pyramid-building we had the other day now that stature of a perfect man pyramid-building instead of the person coming into all the pyramid now add to your faith virtue and so forth all this in first Peter the FIR we should second Peter okay all these things got in this and all again everything and when you're sealed by the Holy Ghost go down to the lights when brother rooster quit on it number 22 I think it is yeah but will will pop icicle this is from the tire in church age I know your faith he does not say here as he did to the church in Pergamos you hold my faith and watch it he doesn't say this now because you're at a tower he is not talking about his faith now he is commending them for their faithfulness and as he does he also mentions their patience the faithfulness and patience go together in fact patience is out working of faithfulness the trial of your faith what are you saying because there's a vast difference that I said a moment ago in saying how faith in God and how the faith of God even how faith in God and you're not born again you can have a head knowledge you can go through all the things as Paul said know all the mysteries in hell not faith sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal you read the whole message some of you will remember the doctrines it with our and understand why that I just I can't go with it because I believe you're born again at faith you get the baptism with the Holy Ghost when you're born again the born-again the new birth and the baptism is all the same it's all right so we'll reentrant side or state again on the day of pentecost the disciples received right here the holy spirit and it's called the faith of the father now remember and you don't hear his talk no more do you you may be heard lately am i talking about the faith of the fathers serious but what about malachi for what about it melikhaya forcedly turned the hearts of the lot children fathers to the children and their children to the father Sean turned them to the New Testament message Malachi 4 had to come to turn us back to the faith of the fathers little random made an outstanding statement in the church age book he said this messenger of Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 revelation 10 7 will do two things 1 turn the hearts of the children to the father's why because we lost that realm that way that the thoughts of a statue of a perfect man were not in Luther Wesleyan in Azusa streets and the things like that no just shouting glory had a loser trying to be a good person and all of that and it was God for that day but they never walked into faith you see Malachi for was to come to turn the hearts of the children then back to the faith of the Father and I've made this statement and I made it 40 years ago and I might as well keep on making it if everybody in the world of the seven billion people in the world today had the faith of the fathers the wonderful world on them but they'd be nothing there or the redemption of the body to finish the full plan Paul only spoke of this case you want to run it by Colonel about Paul only spoke of controlling the body he brought it down to a life statement that we'll get to in the message he brought it to his life statement when he got over in Romans 8 and he brings adoption as whereby we cry out my father read your scripts Romans 8 then he brings it down to the baby form started then he brings it down to the manifestation of the sons and daughters of God then he makes an outstanding statement and he says let's read it let's read it cuz I don't want to miss read it Romans 8 mmm-hmm they can pull that up if they get a change where you can read it Romans eight listen what he's talking about for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption do you know your Bible enough to know that adoption was to the Jews he got brought over to you and I we're about you cry about father there's an adoption the Spirit bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together now watch him for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature the whole creation everything waiteth where these aren't explained agree waited for the manifestation of sons of God purge you second stage of adoption where the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him that suffered the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God look how that nature is groaning crying you think it was wrong when that blew up my end up there walked out in the backyard and bumped a hornet's nest you know their story they all become runnin around him he said little Hornets I'm sorry go back to your home your net they just turned black walk out in the field where there was a killer blue the bull charging and I like the way he's takes time cuz he was human he said it I left my gun in the car now this is what he said see you think brother branham was this that or the other what did he say he said if I'd have had my gun out of killed it went paid for it now read the message he was human but he said something happened he said then he loved the bull then he said bull six years ago lay down the bull went over to lay down he said a walk within a few feet of him and walked out listen church Nature has met its master keep the Scriptures up brother Nature has met its master just for a minute it's met it and a lot of people a lot of people have done a lot of fight doing talk about the prophecy but what about this now I was a creature says he'll be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God don't you think those animals would love for it to be back right what you think though the line would love to be back you know what the line when he's first born his way with some idea that he's a drinker is milk and you know until he becomes an eater of meat is when you got to be scared of it there's plenty of stories where lines and lambs are born and put together and raised up together and they're not dangerous because they've learned well we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth pain together until now watch him now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of the body have you ever looked up to wit I know you can go wit and widdy's and all this that kneel but look it up in the terminology of thinking about Christian when I say it this way where's that pain together until now waiting for the adoption to wit to understand to wit is to understand the redemption of the body there was nobody taught redemption of the body as a reality until this prophet came you so yeah Peter now yeah they quoted things Paul did too he said a lot of things but he never explained it the closest he got was when this quorum can be put on this and that could be put on that then can be said that which is that there he comes down to speak in his life statement to understand the redemption of our bodies that's what the statue of a perfect man is far to understand the redemption of the body you heard me make this statement so then it's not something that some new would say well brother Dale made a good statement or not no I made this 30 40 years ago told when brother Branham said in the church age book messenger Malachi for Luke 17 30 would do two things one turn the hearts of the children back to the father he said it took him review read if you've read or listened to the statute of perfect man you heard him say that he preached thirty years before he could come to that place of that message you know why because he's waiting on somebody that could believe it well what's the second thing of the the two thing nationair malachi for luke 1730 revelation 10 seven will do two things one turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the five to reveal the thunders which is a revelation contained in the seven seals once everybody gets to see you they don't want to hear it they don't hear nobody preach on seals I invite you around the world any word or not not smart smarter I invite you to show me how to get the virtues I asked for you to come and show me how to get the virtues I need the virtues don't you do we not need virtue or knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness only do we not need that tell me how you get it I'm not going to ask for a raise of hands but I'm going to ask you to be honest because most of you have said and listened to me for two years and could not tell how to get the faith of the virtuous yet you've listened to me for 40 years somebody tell me how do you get the virtues I want a scriptural answer I don't want an idea or a quote because you give me a quote and I'm gonna tell you that's a quote how do you get the virtues when we got to have them if you don't know how to get them how do you know where you got them or not but how do you get them do we whoop each other to bring patience do we holler to scream to get them knowledge puffeth up Richard if you can pull that one up I can't remember that exact pull it up with that statement this master of Malachi for Luke 1730 revelation 2:10 7 notice in the church age book which you know what he said in the lady of C in church age that's 1 52 or 54 right about there he tells you exactly how to get to virtues right in black and white but nobody don't want to know about the virtues well we've got him we got him all when we believed it well why have we been here 50 years oh I know what your stuff we're waiting on you brother Dale he guessed right okay thank you it's not being sarcastic he gives us the key he's a dis master of Malachi 4 will do two thing one turn arts of the children back to the faith of the fathers he said to you reveal the thunders which is a revelation contained in the seventh seal and it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn us back and there's the answer it'll be these divinely revealed mystery throughs that literally turn you back and you know what this thunders are the revelation containing the seventh seal well why is everybody against the seals oh we know all about it we know about to see us we know about all this we we wish that we're why horse rider that was once your prophet saying that it would take those seals to turn us back so they got it up now okay we got it 3:27 either way off on the patient right now this messenger of Malachi 4 in Revelation 2:10 7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 you'll turn the hearts of the children to the father's two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the parts of the children to the Pentecostal father's he said exactly so but a lot of you have been here 40 years or a round at 3040 year you didn't pay attention are you paying attention now what if your life was at stake tonight on the basis of what you knew about to turn the hearts of the children to the Father it is what was you listening why does the people turn the seals down that's the one thing the people of this message fight more than anything except Daniel 70 weeks and I love the Daniel 70 weeks because brother Branham said if you don't understand Daniel 70 weeks now this is a quote right out of Daniels 70 weeks message if you don't understand the Daniel 70 way you cannot understand the seals the vague plagues of vials and time and who wants to hear about Daniel 70 weeks come on you I told you I just open it up to a whole thing I show you what it takes it takes while they're coming it takes the word of god and the holy spirit to quicken that word to give us faith the new birth then we can only grow up the stature of a perfect man as the word is being revealed to us because the birth is the word the growth is the word the only way you'll ever come out to a change of the body is to know what those seals is taught cause the seals is for the redemption of the body Co didn't come to redeem a stowaway keep saying that over to why those are soul had already redeemed it was redeemed they're back are in the Bible you were deemed under their Pentecost all them didn't know nothing about the CEOs in the time he never mentioned it but everybody knows that nobody wants to listen they don't want to listen if somebody try to explain things they've already got it figured out that's all I've ever asked you the sincerity in my heart to cry out before God if you know how to get us to the statue of perfect man come and tell me please if it's anything beside the opening of God's Word he's gonna take you seals to open the word because that is part of the work what we got no stand anybody have a neat say number 404 in the spiral book all I want to do is love [Music] anybody have an ace [Music] you have a need a healin tourism Jesus the our desire in your heart to know about God's Word [Music] you said my mother they like it did you think it's you're the only one that knows these things you're wrong I've always taught you what God in new data lineage or juh God is doing in Russia China his room Jamaica around the world have I

exalted when you can tell somebody what you say but how I become your enemy because I've told you the truth [Music] hanging onto it [Applause] [Music] is love in horrific and he's a word [Music] on the grass Oh God Rory [Music] what about it what about it I remember Richard when he first I'd he'd been here a little while and he talking to me one day about statue of perfect land and he said pop he said I'd never seen it he said brother Branham says in that book that we've got to have those verses so you know his pastor former let's do not have been preaching much about it if it's a requirement we've got to have it and if it's a requirement he has got to make a way for us to receive right and he has the message has already been delivered but why would people hate to even listen to some I talk about the seals it's scared to death they're scared to even think about things I don't say if I asked for a raise of hand men in this building had ever read the seal book how many of you have ever even listened to all of the messages of the seven seals father you know it what's in my heart you know my desire and father just used me you let the people know that there's a love
