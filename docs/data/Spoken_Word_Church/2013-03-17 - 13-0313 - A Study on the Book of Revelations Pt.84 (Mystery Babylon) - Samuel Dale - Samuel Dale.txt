just pray that the Lord would bless him take care of him and uh you know keep him they said he was in a lot of pain so let's pray and remember that part Revelations 1 and Revelation 17 any other announcements I generally forget something you know know of any so father we thank you we love you and we ask you now to just come among us and not be an onlooker today and the services but to be the preeminent one in all of our hearts and our lives forgive our sins cleanse us Lord from all unrighteousness and keep us that your love may be made manifest among your people that we may see you and

way bless our brother Rez there Lord and just touch him that you would deliver him Lord from that problem Affliction to the body and just make everything well because we believe you and we thank you in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 we've been reading for quite a while on this so maybe we'll get down to the end of it one of these days since the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to sh unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he said and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that read and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for what the time is at hand I believe that more every day don't you okay Revelation 17 and there came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vows and talked with me saying unto me come hither I will you unto thee the Judgment of the great horde that sit up on upon many Waters with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication so he carried me away into the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet cuted Beast full of names of blasphemia having seven heads and 10 horns and the one was arrayed in purple and scarlet color and decked with gold and precious stones and Pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of abomination and filthiness of her fornication and upon her forehead was a name written mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots and Abominations of the earth and I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the Saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus and when I saw her I wondered with great admiration and the angel said unto me orfor this thou Marvel I will tell thee The Mystery of the woman and of the Beast that carried carried her which hath the seven heads and 10 horns you may be seated The Lord At His blessings to the reading of the word now we're going to have maybe a couple of more services uh picking up maybe a little bit in the 18th chapter Sunday and then try to get into uh more of a positive attitude of talking about the bride of Christ and spend instead of spending so much time uh talking about organizing religions and things and that's what we desire to to get into you know for this day I asked brother Joe if he would and wait these are some if you want to give them out to some that don't have especially the internet ask brother Joe and them to pull it up because uh you know I know the religious world uh is booming today because there is a new pope and you know a new leader and you know I don't say much about these things like that because you know if you was in the Baptist you'd go down and vote on the president or the head of the Baptist Association you know it's just a little difference in the line but um you know this quote here of the Prophet about the pope coming out of the United States and my wife asked me today said if you look that up lately I said well no it's been really quite a while cuz I wasn't concerned about it you know everybody was expecting this Pope to be the one to come out of the United States and I think that what was that man's name Malachi that had had the visions and all this was supposed to been the the last Pope and his name was to be Peter and and all of these things you know so you can get it all set up I've always told you I don't look for the pope coming out of the United States to put us in the Rapture I look for the revelation of the word of God to do that whatever comes out if you you Scout Hallelujah that it' be here but you know so you just there'll be a lot of topes and shadows of of going about among the people of the message that they'll be saying of this that the other of this Pope uh about how that he was elected on the 13th day and the 13th Hour 13th this and all of that and and they admit that he is the first Jesuit priest you know that ever come up to the Jesuit side of the church and all of this and the first one out of this section of the world and all this that and the other but I just wanted to read to you and this for those on the internet that don't have the ability or maybe they didn't find it uh let's just read what the prophet had to say and then we'll get back into our thought about it this is taken from the acts of the Holy Spirit preach in Jeffersonville Indiana in 1954 1219 the evening service paragraph 87 I believe one of these glorious days when this United Confederation of church goes together and the new pope is brought out of the United States and put over there according to prophecy then they'll form an image like unto the Beast I tell you the True Church of God will be drove together the real true believers out of Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal nazarine Pilgrim Holiness whatever they'll be will go together and cemented by the love of God that'll make the body of the Lord Jesus Christ all the Believers and agnostics and shallow minded will be cast to one side they'll go right on into the confederation of churches now uh see everybody's looking for the pope to come out of the United States but I believe what you need to be looking for is this right here before that PO exactly right I believe he's putting the emphasis upon that more than just it's the same emphasis right you got to admit that see but look what he's saying one of these days glor day when the United Confederation of churches goes together well I'd rather look for the churches going together than the pope out of the United States and you know according to my understanding then it's got to be close to the end when it would be to that the confederation of churches would come together right and we would be driven together MH now that's what he says in there we would drive together uh the real True Believer you say yeah but we're not going to be in no bad problems we're not going to be in no time well yeah they're getting together now by the confederation of churches they're getting a new pope he may be live two days and die and they'll get him another one who worries but that's what I'm saying is that every emphasis is made upon it without really even thinking about it that it's not going to be the pope out of the United States put us in the Rapture it's going to be the revealed word of God and if we don't have that we might as well do and I would happen to be watching it sister Trudy called me today and said that they had you know the white smoke had went up and so I just went and clicked it on you know what I happened to get to view it did any of you get to view him then coming out and announcing who he was I mean I did I just happened to be you know I clicked it on I thought well I don't never look at stuff like this you know and I just clicked it up and there it was I saw him come out and announce who he was and everything like that but that didn't make nothing to me what makes me is a revealed word right because if it comes up that the pope comes out of the United States what are you going to do you going to go out and jump up in the air yeah and be r I don't think that's going to be what it's going to be I think it's going to be the revealed word right I've always believed it that way maybe if I'm wrong then I guess we missed a whole lot but now so just put it on that point and think about it a little bit now back up just a higher into Revelations chapter 16 in verse 16 and we talked about the three unclean spirits like frogs coming out of the mouth of someone bringing the world to Armageddon and the prophet never used anything of talking about Russia China India whatever coming down he spoke of Protestants and Catholics coming together gathering around Jerusalem and that's what's right there now right because on the Russian side you have plenty of Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal right on the other side of India or something like that or China coming down you you have Christians andtime but see it has to tie together as I was trying to show you that to where that you and I are having a spiritual battle of Armageddon which is the Battle of the Mind Right amen you know the greatest battle ever fought in being fult right now within our minds to get us to the basis that we can stand it right because just because that that somebody comes along and says the bus is in the parking lot now that might have been a hey day when Le some of you was working at McDonald's you know you you knew if a bus was in the parking lot you're going to be working like crazy for a while but see if I told you the bus is out in the parking lot now and us stay in here that wouldn't do much good right no we got to get on the bus you know what I mean we got to get into the revealed word amen cuz that's going to be the bust to take us out of here not just because some natural happening takes place right all right see in that way you you don't have to worry about it and you say well brother Dale you've always been yep I've always been optimistic pessimistic I guess that's just the way I am I just don't look at things with too much value unless it's got a value to it yeah all right but if it does have a value I'll hang on to it yes I have certain things at my house that that there's not enough money in the world to be able to get them and to you it wouldn't be valuable enough to you know even need get life I have things people gave me that that I would part with every dime I had in my pocket before I part with that because I value that we say wait talk I I value this revealed word amen am and I I sat down now and I just read the book of Revelations and I know I've talked to some of you and I read the book of Revelation now you know what it's not such a mysterious thing I mean you read about this mystery Babylon all right now you can go down and read of what it's got to do with Babylon confusion and the Two Babylons and the you bringing up and down and scopio does those things in his footnotes and he can bring down and bring you some of these uh beasts and animals Etc but what does that mean to you and I to bring it down into Simplicity and see as I said to you that from Revelations about chapter 6 to where we are now in chapter 17 tonight is only like a 3 and 1/2 year period of time right called Jacob's trouble the tribulation period all right and all of these things are taking place there in that time but we are seeing it as it builds up to that that's the point I tried to make where you with the compound meaning compound revelation we see the things working up to that even right now if you said well we're going to we're going to all gather around Jerusalem well it could do it in Jed our plan yes but if you had to depend on getting a lot of people there you would take boats and things like that and it would take months to be able to prepare and get people together right to come around and get around that place but we can just see it as it's unfolding getting ready and we can see who these things are and what it is that it's the mystery Babylon and that mystery Babylon is the Catholic church amen but she's the mother of Harlot amen and we can see that that's organized religion I'll read you one in a minute where brother rown said that the Catholic church was the first organized religion he said in the Lutheran was the second one in Zig and on coming down see all the prophet of God said the Catholic church say that you know we were the original church he said I'll agree you right you're exactly right but not the Roman Catholic Church Catholic means Universal right right the book of Acts was a universal church right the bride of Christ yes Lord but then when you put Catholic and Roman together then you're getting the wrong idea right of what things are going on but I do I just sit down and read and I look at it and I think all of these things that God wrote about and it can be done in 3 and 1/2 years you know and we we we're here now by way of the Prophet messenger being able to see these things and know how they started even in Genesis Y and worked its way all the way through the Bible but then the Bible would sum up the Book of Revelation would sum it up into a short period of time and the many things that I've been on now for week after week after week after week it's only 3 and 1/2 years I can preach 3 and 1/2 years off of what I see on about of these things and I'm sure you probably believe that the way I do but now listen we ought to thank God that we can see right amen these things that was once mysterious and you know we stay I told you and I said it the other day to a a lady you know about the Book of Revelations how long I've been in preaching she she just you could tell she just we don't we don't read them that much we we know and then she seemed she was going wrong and she seemed she said now I don't mean we don't read book of re I I mean in our church things we just don't talk much about the Book of Revelation so you go out and talk to people and see if you don't get it to amen right but you see it's simple to us now the symbols is broken amen right that's right the things that we see are taking place right Among Us amen right this confederation of churches that we just read about it's now getting together right right amen bringing everybody together into the same common belief and what a beautiful thing it is is that right now you think about it and you let have you I know carnal had you rather have this church sitting over here right beside of us and it's more beautiful than ours you but had you'd rather have that sitting there or a beer joint or honky dong I'm not throwing off on those people I'm trying to get you to think and we have nothing to do with them we not if I was I'd go over there and talk to them I'm talking to you and me I sitting there today looking and seeing that great I don't even know what they called it the arena I guess in my words that ain't it but the great place over 100,000 people gathered and holler and Viva Pope or VI something father you know wouldn't it be something if you could get 10 yeah tonight in The Same Spirit yeah to rejoice and say hallelujah amen that's right you know about what we see he said Brother D you mean you're not even counting all of us no I ain't counting all us cuz it ain't going to work on everybody but some people are going to see it and believe it and be happy about it right I'm happy that it's come to an end come on for no other reason I'm getting old number one talking to a guy today and he said how old are I said 72 he said I'm 74 I said I ain't too bad he said them two years is bad you but listen Church most of us sitting here are over the age you know the word time is very valuable and if we don't get out of here they going to be some funerals preached because of the natural thing no no now brother Dale God's going to let every one of us live to be 140 but I I don't want to be 140 I just don't want to do that I'm sorry right but now listen Church looking at and I know that now in the message it's beginning and I'm not jealous of nobody or nothing we can have a beautiful church and a lot of payments you know and probably not as many payments as a lot of people have but I'm just trying to make a point they're beginning to get a lot of churches in the message now that are beautiful and that's wonderful then you don't owe a payment until it's due if you paying $10,000 a month you don't owe that payment until it's due amen it's not no bad thing it it's not nothing to do is like the scripture that says ow no man nothing we know the what the prophet said about that right that doesn't mean you can't owe your bills and buy your cars and make payments on it and it just means when you try to beat the people out of it you know they old no man nothing y i i told a lady d getting my haircut that I wanted to keep her in debt to me cuz i' owed her for a haircut and I had to pay her for two of them today and and uh she always just says forget it Sam don't worry and I said no I want to keep you in debt to me no that ain't right I said yeah that is right I want to keep you in debt to me because that way I may need something someday and she owes me you know if I keep her in debt to me all right but now the point is this Bible is opened now right amen this this book is open Amen to we can read from Genesis to Revelations and I don't mean that I understand everything that's in there I didn't say that but I'm just saying that we can read it with understanding until we can see what's going on right amen and it's not that we used to well what's your opinion or what that means you know right it's not bad it's God's word amen that he's given into the hands of the bride of Christ right amen for her to be able to read I've told you over and over how many times have I preached on you that the that the Book of Revelations is a bride's book amen how many times have I made that statement see we can read it it's talking right in in the very day and the hour that we're living you want to know what's going on read it turn around and read about Israel right amen that's the two things I read I I keep the I watch you know in the what I can see on the internet or what I can do if it's anything about Israel I I'll read it you know I I want to keep up with them but I want to keep up where you and I are at right amen we're right here in a beautiful time that we understand and and see what these things mean yep that's right and Marvel at the Simplicity you know a mystery until it's revealed is totally away from your in intellectual abilities right now you know what I mean by that you can read it we read mystery babyon the Harlot you know the mother of whes and whatever we read them as a Baptist Methodist well what did we know but see now we can read it and see exactly what it's talking about Y and in seeing it then it just unfolds that we can read for ourselves right what is talking about us that even that God would think so much of it until you know now this is a point I've tried to get across for the longest that in the Book of Revelations the bride is not seen after Revelations 41 she's in heaven amen she comes back in Revelations 19 but yet God doesn't leave it with without showing us so we'll get to it like Sunday on Revelation 184 come out of her my people right that's compound meaning right Israel coming out of the World Council systems and and all that Us coming out of the church yeah God doesn't just put it all this I said over here and right in the middle of all of it he'll lay something down for us to look at that's a beautiful Jewel amen that's what I've always tried to tell you that you reading the Bible and you read back there you know and you read so and so beg got so and so and so and so beg got so and so and so and so for got so and so and an hour later you're still reading so and so for got so and so you know if you don't read all of that you don't get a gold star that you read the whole book right so we read it but you know what after I done it come into the message and begin to see cuz I've seen a little bit back there what and it'd be very odd CU you're reading so and so we got so and so and so and we got so and so and and all at once there a jewel laying there and then the next verse is so and so we got so and so but you know you wouldn't get that Jewel if you didn't read the whole book amen so it's not trying to get a star in your cown but see that to me is the way God keeps our attention it's either tonight or tomorrow uh Sunday morning brother says and look said we go back to Revelations 3:14 and that's what I've always told you about Revelations 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel this message will go to Israel of Revelation 107 but in the days of the voice of the seven Angel we know what's going to Israel right right so it's a beautiful book amen a wonderful opportunity to be able to just read in all amen it be like getting a book you know you and and you read about half of it in the pages is missing that's what it used to be right I want to know what the rest of it is right and then you might find three pages missing and then you might find it start back over the book well you don't know who Mary John is you know so you miss it but when the whole book unfolds right and the whole book is Bound By The Book of Revelations that's what I love about it you said no we can read these other things that's right you could read them but the wonderful part is to find that we can read the book of Revelations and see what Paul was talking about in Galatians right amen right right that we couldn't understand what he was talking about until we read the book of Revelation right so then it's not a horrible thing to look at it but it's it's just going through the book to see what it's talking about and seeing where it's at see we can read our in in our scriptural reading you know and we read how that the the uh well go ahead brother Jo just pull that up and we'll start from that if I don't get to I can finish Sunday go ahead pull number one one but it's just a rereading of Revelation 171 to 7 I think it is see we can read and there came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vs we've been through the vs we know what they are the pledge the things that are going to take place and talk with me saying unto me come hither and I'll show unto thee the Judgment y now remember that tonight the Judgment of the Great that sit up many Waters judgment doesn't mean that it's finalized at that point are done there's a judgment to come to that church system right you know a a destroying right but the judgment's done made right as brother Brown said you could put a George Washington and Abraham Lincoln in every office in in the United States and couldn't pull it out do you remember that quote right amen well see then you could put a William bradam in ever denomination there is and you couldn't pull the thing out cuz they throw him out cuz they did y but you see what I'm talking about the Judgment set so now John is going to be told the Judgment we've looked back before seeing who it is now you see the Judgment of it what's going to be her condemnation look with whom the kings of the earth now you say boy something far right now the only one king I reckon really is there even a king over England no there's a queen there's not a king in the world today I don't reckon you know what I mean now you could go to an African thing and they'd be the king of a tribe that's the way they would call it but still he's not a king of a tribe I mean he just king of that parts right there because he's still under the government so he he he's he's not a king brother R said it's dictators dict even in the big old countries he said it's dictators because they're only for a short time right see they're going going to rule for like a three and a half year period of dictators and he said they'll all go to Communism we look at it today all of them's gone to Communism even though we go over there and bail them out give them billions and fight their Wars for them and what happens now I read yesterday in Afghanistan the population the people of Afghanistan is one of the United States believe they want us to get out think they were happier the way they were right what whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication now that's not natural physical things that's spiritual fornication with the doctrines and the and the things right and the inhabitants of the earth see if you just left it with Kings you'd have a problem so God covers it leaving all the inhabitants nowhere of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication not her alcoholic beverages yet they are pretty lenient today in the had this method this Presbyterian all the you know Catholics and all they just Dr and do what they want to you know but it's not that it's the wine of her fornication it's the wine of her Doctrine see now we understand see it wouldn't be all the nations drunk with wine but it's a fornication it's a Doctrine like I told you the other day then it doesn't matter to me whether it's Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal Catholic bramit delites lulaes any you want to put on the thing and mohammadan or or islamics or whatever all it would be it's trinitarian doctrines it's it's worship of many gods right right back to the old Roman idea see so he carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman sit up on a Scarlet colored Beast full of names of blasphemy we'll get back to that in a minute having seven heads and 10 horns we know who that is who sits on seven heels who has the the Kings and all of the earth and the woman was aray in purple and scarlet color and decked with gold and precious stones and Pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of Abominations and filthiness of her fornication what about so beautiful of things I said a moment ago sitting there today looking to see this great big arena to where the people are just gathered and waiting for the the man to walk out and it's beautiful there mhm yeah yep I mean I know you look at some of those old buildings and to maybe to you they don't look too good but to me I look at the beauty of a building and I see the architectural designs and I see the the construction and I see the workmanship that went into doing it it's beautiful you know I love to see those old buildings like that and see those see a castle when we were in Ireland and that was that was something you know even the construction of things I told you about when I was there you know they they had he always you you would be going up this way you know and all the stairways went this way but they had a few of them that their stairway went the other way they Wonder well what's what's it going on well they come to find it out see if you were upstairs Defending Your Home when you're coming down the guy's coming up the Steep he got to reach out with his sword way around and you're just reaching around and getting him well they found out that some of those guys was left-handed so if he was left-handed you'd be doing this going around see so you just make you st go other I thought to me that was an amazing feat you know and one of them had a tunnel and said you can just go down in and go out to the ocean and Escape you know that was marvelous to me I like to look at things like that and see the beauty this St now look at the rest up go ahead brother look back up cuz this is not a you you you look you go to ride down the road today and you look at these beautiful churches right right this beautiful monuments that are supposed to be to Christ and you see the work they're doing yeah right you know and how they're feeding the blind I mean the the hungry they're they're s spending money all over the world to take care of people and feed them and orphans and and all kind it's beautiful right y see but not realizing this death that's right Amen to me there's nothing prettier than a black with a spider but I wouldn't want to be her husband right because it's instant death right but I mean Beauty go on there but watch now she was arrayed in purple now what did Brother around and say he said there's three curtains he said there a bamboo and iron and a purple he said don't worry about about the bamboo and the iron he said we about that purple curtain he said there's no scripture where communism will ever rule the world but said there is that Catholicism will rule the world right the purple curtain y but you see look how close it is purple rose My Savior wor the things for me he bore right look at that Bible with the the purple yeah look how close that these things are you know that brother around we get down to it don't wor time but when we get down to it you know he said that that's that first white horse rider wrote out yep and and look at it AR raay in purple and scarlet color and Deck with gold and precious stones and pearls and having a golden cup in her hand very valuable but it's full of Abominations and filter of a fornication right it's not full of wine you're going to find out later if you if you'll read on through the chapter you'll find especially when we get back a little that she's got her judgment set right yeah and that's what I'm trying to get here to show you it's a judgment but look and upon her forehead was a name written mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots and Abominations of the earth now that's we know who that is and what it is right but go ahead and pull it up brother Joe if you got it now get under CH verse 6 and seven but I just gave him them five but I done cut out all my notes I ain't got to it yet anyway so let's read it and I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the Saints and the blood of the martyrs of Jesus you'll find out if you'll keep on reading the scriptures her judgment is said according to what she done she killed the saint she's destroyed y y all right when I saw her I wondered with great admiration y mhm and the angel said unto me wherefor why why why is th Marvel and the angelist said why are you marbling see he's he's looking at it from one way John is looking at the beauty of everything and how wonderful it looks but the angel is looking at the rest of it he knows who it is he said why are you marveling yep I will tell thee The Mystery of the woman and the Beast that carth her which have the seven heads and 10 horns then he goes on down so you read on through I doubt if we'll cover much more of the 17th chapter you read on down through and just see John admired y this the angel asked why did you admire why did you Marvel right cuz John didn't know the secret of the mystery right right he didn't know who that was see it would have had to been shown him we are over here on this side right what do they call it uh Hinds side is 2020 you know you know hind side is real good why because you can stand over here and look at it like I've always said you know we we Baptist we used to say say well poor old Nicodemus Jesus said you must be born again all Nicodemus had to do believe but Nicodemus did believe and put his job on the line and he believed right when it him that said we believe that D of man come from God right y pretty good believer but yet he couldn't see the mystery John at this time is not seeing the mystery and he's admiring her you want the prophet goad down and pull up number two this is the spoken word is Original Seed book two 62 318 paragraph 20 watch The Prostitute of Revelation 17 was a church John had admired her because of her of her beauty what she was now come on she was a beautiful thing y right but yet in her was found the blood of ever sa of Jesus Christ had been murdered in her but see John didn't see that he saw the beauty you you you go out and you start trying to talk to people about this message and start telling them about organized religion and they see the churches and they see what the things that they're doing and they look back at us and say what are y'all doing well we ain't doing nothing CU we don't believe doing stuff like that cuz that's organized religion I've never said a word in the world whatsoever against Church systems in the bases of them trying to help somebody I've always told you I thank God for where I come from then I found out the prophet said them denominations was even carriers to bring us to Christ but boy you don't let that don't go about with the preachers right they don't want you to talk about that I never was in them denominations will you membership card said you was yeah right see I have no trouble with my name being at the Baptist Church her in Gillsville in gold on a wall of a stack of deacons I've always tried to thank every preacher even all it within this message that I had to walk away from I thank them for them helping me mhm I ain't going to thank nobody for for deceiving me no they did didn't deceive you honey you was already if you have listened they might have helped you some but now same thing there same thing now you ain't going to listen that's right but John coming under patmas 60 years or so with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and when he sees the church he don't see a cup in the hand of her sitting there drinking blood right he sees a church system right that's beautiful y y right come on Church see right that's where you don't like what I say about things but forget it I'm going to say it you and I sit here and don't try to help nobody and they're out there helping working theirself to death right y to send things to the world giving the lifesty they got enough sitting on a pocket full of money that's right that's right you see I don't mind calling it like it is cuz I don't believe it this P Pat around about it John saw this he admired it you want me to put it in other words I know you ain't going to like it but go ahead he was deceived right no C said that I agree with you 100% that was mine but if he admired her if he marveled at her he must have been deceived by the beauty right right y look the next one taking from the first seal paragraph 328 63-18 328 excuse me paragraph 328 it was 3 63 318 paragraph 328 now he said they wanted it so he would give them a strong delusion remember this prostitute of Revelation 17 she is a mystery mystery babon the mother of Harlot and John admired her just like this man look where do we get here and watch him watching this horse here you talking about the first horse r or right right the first see the white horse rider when John sees the White Horse Rider riding out he doesn't know what that is come on as the seal didn't break the John he didn't know what that white horse rider was right come on Church get it right amen and you know what until we get it right we're deceived right amen you want some quotes but brother Brown said I cared a Baptist Bible and converted them to a Baptist Faith No brother brand he know it all the time well he said he didn't know what the white horse rider was right right and I thought that when he got into the seal book he came out with a couple of statements like this he said for once in my life he said I wondered about you more religion he said but now I see it you know what it had him deceived it had everybody deceived it was an antichrist a white horse rider but nobody knew it was an antichrist right it was white horse rider it look just like Christ the church if You' have seen the church riding what would you called it MH well now brother brother Dale the the the the early church with just poor old common folks I know what you're talking about I can read too but you know this Antichrist thing deceived everybody whose names will get to it eventally in the scripture whose names that are not written in the land Book of Life from the foundation of the world are going to be deceived by this world system of church amen right amen that's why I say folks don't worry about getting deceived you already are weever W was serving those systems amen right Y come on read it then would you notice what happened was this that he admired her with great admiration but the mystery was that she drank the blood of the martyrs of Christ a beautiful Church set their deck in purple and gold and she had a cup in her hand of the filthiness of her fornication now can't you just see though people explaining that take off the last few words and right there you know just take that out filter this over fornication and look you got a beautiful system of beautiful woman happing the world and she's sitting with a Gold Cup right that's beautiful doesn't it but see then you got to have the rest of it to find out what's in that cup right see when John was told in that cup was the filter of her fornication he didn't think she's too beautiful right you know when it ever Stripes home to you and I right to see where that denomination systems and things that in those people and they they're people they're good people I love them I I you know there's good people in this world in the churches and the things make us ashamed of ourselves that's we had a lady in the Baptist Church back there she said I don't I wouldn't make my bed if I had an opportunity to testify to somebody about Jesus Christ and she meant it there's people just give their whole lives and all the money they got and everything to the church because they believe the church is the saving system right what about it right her beautiful doctrines now let's get to that after we get over to the other and we'll just quit on that part and not go to the rest of the message I'll take it up Sunday what about the beautiful doctrines right if it wasn't for the truth about one God what would we have right we'd still be drinking out of the same old cup well I I get into the message people with it and just see what kind of cup is going wrong around the B some beautiful cups are floating around you know what I mean preachers with great anointings and great crowds of thousands of thousands falling after them and and believing what they're saying but is it the same wine of fornication in the cup as it was that we used to have right come on folks that's where I stand right you see because I'm trying to lead a group of people away from that cup of the fornication amen but if we're not leted away from it we're no different than anybody else right right oh no no we're we're Brites you know I always got them in trouble in the Bible y yep what you see I'm talking about things wouldn't look so beautiful if we look through and saw what it really is the prophet gets over into the fourth seal and he speaks of death that he says that the angel of that that combat Beast is the only one that really called it death which we know that would be our day in the prophet's message right you know what he said about it he said it was death all the time right it didn't become death under the foreal it was death in the beginning little Deeds little doctrines little sayings was death in the beginning that's right it was death in the garden when Eve just one word de but they're good people nobody said word about that it's my brother R see people don't understand it he said I am not against organization you want that quote Oh no I got these quot why don't you read on a little bit you find something he's saying he said I'm against the system of organized religion I was listening to him the other night on the table he was saying he says Dar Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostals all with that Holy Ghost filled experience see we look back no nobody ain't got it but what we got in the end time but looking back there and he would talk about those people right he said those brothers are filled with the Holy Ghost right now you make him AAR go right ahead that's between you and the Lord which you see church if we just looked at the whole system of organized religion without looking at it in the basis of of of a doctrinal issue right what could you say hey do you you get what I mean by that look at it without a doctrinal issue involved right yep what would you see sure they've gone off cutting their hair painting their face and shorts and everything else and all that stuff but there's a lot of people in this world that don't do that you know I see somebody walk around in the store and I see a lady with a dress on and long hair I really want to talk to him but I just better not I guess you know there there's still a lot of women that dress right and do right see because take away the doctrinal issues what is it we're human beings yep no we got the Holy Ghost and they don't have it it might be true but you know they might have the Holy Ghost and we might not have it that might be true bless cuz there's only one way to know right right it's whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word right keeps on ageing not agreeing when up to so far and then quit you know we could walk right over there and give that evidence tonight we can say you people here do you believe God's word to be true and they say Amen right which you see Church John admired that yep John admired that church system whatever you want to call if you want to be Technical withen and say admire the admire the organization not the system because of what I said while ago go ahead see that's why I don't throw off on those churches why throw off on them and condemn them to hell the Bible has already told you there when we reach this position here of Revelations 17 and we reading theight we've done going in the Rapture right there is no hopes of Salvation to make you a bride after Revelations 4:1 no right there's foolish virgins to be contented with yes they'll have to give their life for the gospel that they believe but no bride no dealing with salvation after the Rapture the John admired her the scripture said he marveled he looked at her the FR said with great admiration because of her beauty but then when he found out what was in that cup right yep and you know what he didn't find out what was in that cup by himself that's right and you and I didn't find out about this word by ourselves that's right amen it took God sending us a prophet to be able to break those things and then sending us a fful Ministry to tell us these things amen and why is it to people the message are afraid of the Book of Revelation why are they afraid of the seals and the things why are they afraid of Daniel 70 weeks the Y we yet to know all about one God you said well why Brother D do you talk to us about it because those doctrines are right here and if they're not killed they're going to fare up well I'm trying to do one or two things either kill them or flare them up right right cuz that's all I can do I don't have any other choice at least I don't pet you on the back and tell you you're going to heaven because you believe this prophet's message when we get over to about the 19th Chapter where it says his wife has made herself ready right amen what do we get on over maybe a little bit further into some of these things that we get to talk more about the bride cuz I'm just trying to get us away from organized religion and our thoughts and our ideas and destroy those things that have an effect upon us a beautiful Church there's more Bibles in the world today than there ever been amen more Christians right what is it 1.2 billion Catholics right and you know out of that there's some good people you know out of that there's a lot of them that don't believe Mary is there they're just caught in a system y well you know what you and I used to be called in a system whether you like it or not whether you ever went to church or not he was born organizational amen right no matter what we were born in a system with a man's ideas or even our own right with nine times out of 10 that's the worst thing you get somebody that won't tell you what they believe you really don't want to know what they believe how about that you don't want to know what somebody don't not somebody believes that won't tell you what they believe that's why I just go ahead and tell you what I believe then you can do you know you you can pray for me or pray with me either way you want to make it cuz I just want to tell you like it like I see it in that way to my family my kids my wife my grandkids and great grandkids I just want them to know the truth that's the reason I'm preaching is because I want my family to have an opportunity right and I want this church family to have an opportunity talking with a brother there last Sunday talking about blood relation is not what it is blood relation is not what it is no there's people that you love sometimes better than you do your own blood relationship right right sir it's not dad is I told him I said we talk about kids I said these are my kids yeah I said they call me Poppy and my wife nanny I said that's just their kids right been there when a lot of you was born doctor need me to I can spank you cuz I was right tired and dedicated you to the Lord I just can't all love you my kids amen see because we have one goal and one thought amen that's right they try to get out of here Amen in a Rapture what about it John admiring the white horse rider that's what your Prophet said did that's right and that things deceived everybody in the world Clarence Lin taught that the white horse rider was the Antichrist before brother random come along but do you think he knew what he was talking about by Revelation right no I don't think so I think he was just lucky guess or thought you know some concept that he had I saw a lot of things before I heard of this message they wound up some of them to be true but a lot of them wound up wasn't too much good what about you all right I saw the Old Testament saints were not born again until Jesus Christ died I saw that in the Baptist Church and tried to tell people about it I saw a lot of things back there some of them was true like I said some of was wrong I had to you know try doctors I had to get rid of it yes Lord but I'm just trying to get you to see a point let's don't get caught with looking at things just because they're beautiful but if you really look if you really look at an old barn with a new paint job it's beautiful right but what's under the paint see my ideas and your ideas of prophet said are not working now that's right what do you think about this brother Donnie what do you think about it I believe every word that Prophet said I've had a many of people do that you've been around a lot of people that would say that I believe everything he says but then where are they today right yet a lot of them are still religious going to churches and things cuz the 70 that left the Lord Jesus they never went back to the world right brother R said they probably went on preaching they probably went on casting out devils and things like that but see they left the truth right right what about a beautiful Church When They Carried Jesus around to it and showed him look at this look at this said it was 46 years y in the building of this Temple man worked and slaved and sweated and made a beautiful beautiful place Jesus said in 3 days y it'll be destroyed they thought he's talking about the building but he wasn't he was talking about this building here right right but you know what it didn't take much over 3 days when Titus got through right y but you think about it now let me end it with a is there any way to express or understand or explain this human anatomies or whatever the words you want to use person you're looking at whatever I don't have to tell my hand to raise I don't have to go down the street pick up foot sit down foot pick up foot pick I don't have to do that right right because there's something about in there told you took me 16 years to learn to ride a bicycle but I can still do it right now you know maybe a little wobbly but can you explain the human being that's right is there anything greater than a human being building the image of God that even in his Fallen estate there's nothing like him he can go to the moon and back getting almost to the day to um almost impossible things can be done by mankind man was just telling me recently that he actually witnessed now that of his words but the fact that they had gotten mankind to a place that they told it happened in Kuwait I believe it was that they had a way of making you invisible and they could actually walk right up to a tank and drop a grenade in and they could never see him you say that's stupid brother Dale well so did so did Arville W's daddy think they stupid right yeah that's right see there's so many Supernatural things that are being done by mankind which you know my point is one thing it's coming from mankind that's right he's broken the the prophet said into God's laboratory and there's nothing impossible to the mind of man is that Genesis nothing is withholding yeah we got to put him out because L he takes of the tree of life and lives forever didn't say Eternal forever right nothing is withholding from his mind to what he can do right I'm old enough to remember the old Buck Rogers and and different movies that was made years ago of inter planetary travel and ray guns and and all kind of things they have them now mhm if you don't believe in a supernatural go home and and throw you a Biscuit in the microwave and turn it on but you better not put the cab in there go the poor old Fell's gone what's it doing so what end okay explain all of it what's it doing your Prophet said right here in this room is enough electricity to light up the whole world you realize in my hand is enough atoms to make an atam bomb the Bible says nothing is withholding from mankind what you can think of can be done I remember reading in the old comic scripts and the things and all of that that they made hover crass that could just coming up onto the ground you know and just just come up and just go up and land and World War II we lost thousands of thousands of thousands of troops having to try to come through the water to get up on the bank to wait they just rose right up went across the water and them fell are sitting over there looking see when they run into all them bombs they going to get blowed up that thing comes over just sets them down Vietnam they spray sprayed the Treet Toops landed the troops on them and let them ripel off to the ground you think that ain't a beautiful thing people like Einstein that their minds were so great where did that come from it com from the fact that there is a supernatural almighty God Eternal right amen that's right that he's allowed us to break into his laboratory and do all these great things until the world admires it looking in the paper today where're we're in a magazine let's see smithonian Institute magazine where we showing the world as a thing and it was showing by lighter colors was more educated and more sophisticated type of world and the darker color showed the the fact of lower things you know less sophisticated and the whole United States is just clear as a crystal when I talk Revelation 13 show the United States that almost the whole United States was just showing it was illuminated by intellectual understanding y what is man that t mindful of him and the son of man that I visited him a body thou H has prepared me we are his body right amen the beautiful marvelous wonderful bride I'll say this ahead of time because I'm eventually going to get through it a bride can signify just an engagement a wife can be used as that word you're not take unto the marry thy wife cuz that which is conceived in her of the Holy Ghost so we don't just flop words when John sees that bride and in Revelations 19 you don't see her with a cup of Wrath he SE her in pure wife amen amen that's what I want to get away from this talking about organized religion and get on but I want to make sure that we see this right you said yeah but we we've been in the message now 30 40 years amen how long's the message been in us right amen what's the message done for you and I made us an educated bunch of people that are really spiritual ignor remises what about it right a beautiful thing to look about the world and see the religious Society go over to the Islamic and read their what is it Quran is that the word for it and you know that talks about being good he talks of a happy Hunting Ground to go to when to die maybe you know other words and terms but but what kind of a cup do we have in our hand come on let stand take on these things where would we be if had to been for this message right that's right you would be but do we look down on the world as secondaries or pons or something below us because of what we believe we do there's something wrong with our Bel and we still got that cup of that wrath of the wine of her fornication we think we're better than somebody because of the color of our skin or because it is colored whatever you want to say that would make us better we're all human kind of odd I can give you a blood transfusion and kind of odd you can give me one there must not be any difference in us oh that serpent seed like I said the other day have we went to these other nations to try to get them away from their gods and things and brought them to our understanding and brought them to America to civilize them yeah and look what we're doing with them I reading today where that they still have in the Amazon they still have tribes and tribes and tribes of people that won't even associate with the human beings whatsoever but there even the government is even admitting now would we be better off to bring them out or leave them alone that's what they're saying I read that I thought that's amazing I went back it again if we brought him out what would we do to him right said he took a lot of the Indians and said what do we do said we brought them out and put them in in health and brought food you know clothing whatever and said made them uh clowns said because people were paying to see them dance right and perform their rituals I remember reading way back probably 40 years ago or later that they went over into and I always say Africa cuz I don't I can't keep all of it straight they went to a tribe there and they found out that they all had beautiful teeth and there were no cavities whatsoever in the whole time so they gave them toothpaste and toothbrushes and taught them the hygiene part of brushing their teeth and they went back a few years later and they had to take dentist over there to doctor all of their cavities that they developed we civilized only yeah but that's part of that system I'm talking about that's beautiful looks good brother don't you want them people over have good teeth no I'd like to have theirs you want to talk a little about brother random he said that man standing out there was it two or 300 yards with his natural eye seeing where they was hitting on the Target right yeah he said man I'd love to have his eyesight he said but look at him said he walked down the street and said there like a maggot piece of meat and he said just picks it up and eats it it sure must be good for his eyes see Church let's don't forget where we came from I'm not one of those trying to get us back to the sawdust Trail I never was on the sawdust Trail I just went in Pentecostal I've been there been to Old brush Arbor meetings when you didn't have nothing but tree limbs laying over the top of you old stumps cut down and a board nailed on it went to church I don't want to go back to there I want Jesus Christ to come and live in you and I to take us away from our ideas and thoughts then have I become your enemy because I tell you the truth I'm sorry for that but not sorry for what I say see you and I are still admiring that system whether we like it or not that's true because if we're sympathetic with it we're admiring it that's right you said no if I got to preach that over again now you done miss my whole thought okay cuz I preached about that that man right over there he'd do anything in the world for us they're good people but I can't help it if God chose me to be his bride and I want to be his wife sir I want to prove that what we got number 20 in the red book have that way number 20 in your red book anybody have a need I am oh and we've seen you bring back guns we've seen you bring back why can't believe me anybody else just Hallelujah God said one day we talk enough about that was on my mind all day today we talked enough about organized religion I want to end it up with this part your will be speaking of things and what happen and all that but let's get on to the real beautiful part of the Bride of Jesus Christ we got another sermon of something then we just try to lift up and move on about you have a need just want to Len have th own way have I oh my this one could stand here she came to a place where they would have been hollered they would have been hollered and yet she left all of that she come follow you eyes understanding believe thank you for caring us for you you believe it s
