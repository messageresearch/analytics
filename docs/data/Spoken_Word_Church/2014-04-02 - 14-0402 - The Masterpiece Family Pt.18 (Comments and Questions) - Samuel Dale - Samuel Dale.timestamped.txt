[3:35] and I turned to see the voice that spake
[3:37] with me and being turned I saw seven
[3:39] golden candlesticks
[3:41] and in the midst of the seven
[3:42] candlesticks one like unto the son of
[3:44] man clothed with a garment down to the
[3:46] foot and gird about the pouch with a
[3:49] golden girdle you may be seated the Lord
[3:52] had his Blessing to the reading of the
[3:55] word
[3:56] now I want to just come in a little bit
[3:58] got a few quotes I want to read relating
[4:01] to what I've been trying to do and then
[4:04] we will
[4:05] get into comments and questions and I
[4:08] encourage you for your comments because
[4:11] you know that way I learned more of
[4:14] what's on your heart and mind by
[4:16] questions and by you commenting on what
[4:19] you see in the things and we just pray
[4:22] that the Lord would have
[4:23] yeah
[4:25] we started this series
[4:28] 18 messages ago
[4:31] on the Masterpiece family
[4:34] and
[4:35] in doing that my full purpose
[4:38] was for one thing for us to you and I
[4:43] to recognize
[4:45] the day that we are living
[4:49] and the word for the hour that we're
[4:52] living in you know the part for us
[4:55] and and how that the full word is to
[4:59] come into being
[5:00] in this last days
[5:03] you see then we are to recognize our day
[5:07] and its message and I would that you
[5:09] would listen to that message or read it
[5:11] you know recognizing your day in this
[5:13] message because
[5:15] you know to most people recognizing your
[5:18] day in this message it recognize that
[5:19] God sent a prophet
[5:21] that's That's the basis of it and that's
[5:23] wonderful that's part of it but you know
[5:26] we'll read in here just for a second
[5:27] what he was talking about on paragraph
[5:30] 184 he's talking about people
[5:32] recognizing
[5:34] and he says the past 25 years Israel has
[5:36] just recognized that they're in the
[5:38] Homeland
[5:39] for something it was prophesied they'd
[5:41] have to be gathered again Isaiah said so
[5:44] we read it a while ago God help us to
[5:47] understand it all right
[5:49] paragraph 185.
[5:51] at the same time
[5:53] and listen the bride has recognized the
[5:57] evening light
[5:58] just begin to recognize
[6:02] the hungry Pentecostals have begin to
[6:05] recognize
[6:07] that them organizations hasn't got
[6:09] anything they was looking for they're so
[6:12] twisted and torn up since the time of
[6:15] recognition recognition he says you've
[6:18] got to recognize
[6:19] the world has recognized the Nations is
[6:22] recognized science is recognize the
[6:25] devil has recognized it's the time that
[6:28] he can wreck women wreck the church
[6:30] wreck the people he's recognized it and
[6:33] God has recognized that there is a
[6:36] people on Earth that he predestinated to
[6:38] life
[6:39] he recognized this in the time to send
[6:42] his message
[6:43] he did it the people had recognized it
[6:46] the bride time has recognized the
[6:48] evening light and if Sodom had been
[6:52] recognized Sodom had have recognized her
[6:55] day when she seen those Messengers come
[6:58] down like Billy Graham and Oral Roberts
[7:00] recognizes not just totally it's all
[7:03] together paragraph 196.
[7:07] he said it
[7:09] people get they recognize say
[7:11] Pentecostals oh my why don't you
[7:13] recognize your day
[7:16] recognize the day of the evening time it
[7:19] is here
[7:21] and it's here yeah that to vindicate the
[7:24] coming of Christ to vindicate it we're
[7:27] at the end
[7:29] recognize your day
[7:31] all right recognizing your day all right
[7:34] so there's no way we could recognize our
[7:36] day whatsoever as I've tried to bring
[7:38] you without God sending the prophet
[7:41] so we've we've gone through that part
[7:44] that he's brought the message and we're
[7:46] still reading the message and enjoying
[7:49] the the things that he taught you know
[7:52] and still getting more each time as we
[7:55] read and study and and things it just
[7:58] keeps unfolding because God always will
[8:01] read in a minute he always sends a
[8:03] prophet first sure
[8:05] because that's part of it because the
[8:08] word don't come to you and I the word
[8:11] comes to the prophet then it comes to
[8:13] you and I
[8:14] right
[8:15] a five-fold ministers involved then
[8:18] you're involved
[8:19] see and we come to that place but to
[8:22] recognize our day in this message
[8:25] he recognize Who We Are
[8:29] Luther recognized who he was that I've
[8:32] been over it and over and over
[8:34] maybe maybe he didn't recognize he was
[8:37] the angel of the fifth Church age Etc
[8:42] he may have you know I don't know that's
[8:44] no problem but he recognized one thing
[8:48] he recognized that it was time to preach
[8:51] the just shall live by faith all right
[8:54] and when that was brought forth then the
[8:56] people could make that manifest right
[9:00] all right so he recognized that
[9:02] and see what do we need more than
[9:04] anything
[9:06] they can put these up if they want to
[9:08] and we can read a little but
[9:11] page 34 of the church age book The
[9:13] revelation of Jesus Christ oh how we
[9:15] need Revelation by the spirit
[9:17] we don't need a new Bible we don't need
[9:19] a new translation though some are very
[9:21] good and I'm not against them but we
[9:24] need the revelation of the spirit and
[9:27] thank God we can have what we need for
[9:31] God wants to reveal his word to us by
[9:35] his spirit all right
[9:37] we need a revelation more than anything
[9:39] now
[9:42] my point has been for us to try to
[9:45] understand ourselves
[9:47] amen who we are amen all right
[9:50] now a recognizing of the Prophet coming
[9:52] right recognize lady osia as being here
[9:55] recognize Russia coming this way China
[9:58] coming that way recognizing where the
[10:00] end time is wonderful
[10:03] but to recognize
[10:05] who we are and what we're here for
[10:09] amen we've got a purpose each age had a
[10:11] purpose all right Amendment right the
[10:15] East age
[10:16] come forth in this time
[10:19] and look what the prophet says number
[10:20] three of the quote makes 15 Revelations
[10:23] Jesus Christ
[10:24] and remember this Christ in the true
[10:26] church is a continuation in the book of
[10:28] Acts
[10:31] drop on down and he said he knows that
[10:33] it's a church and if the people
[10:35] get the true revelation of the true
[10:38] church in what she is what she stands
[10:41] for
[10:42] that she can do the Greater Works
[10:46] come on
[10:47] she will be an invincible Army oh well
[10:51] we're just going to church we just
[10:53] playing around waiting you know
[10:55] waiting on the pope to come out of the
[10:57] United States and waiting on the the the
[11:00] woman to get in the White House and boy
[11:02] we'll get all excited then you know
[11:06] that's not exactly like he sounds like
[11:08] he's saying
[11:09] if they get a true revelation of what
[11:13] the two spirits were
[11:16] within the framework
[11:19] of the Christian church
[11:23] now what is two spirits
[11:25] that you and I need to deal with
[11:29] right and we say well I want them to
[11:30] Holy Spirit and the other Spirit of the
[11:31] devil
[11:32] all right
[11:35] but
[11:37] what about being
[11:39] the real bride in the spirit
[11:43] and what about coming down to the
[11:45] anointed ones
[11:48] with the same Holy Spirit
[11:52] they recognize what they're doing
[11:56] then we can recognize the day that we're
[11:58] living so you not have to worry if they
[12:01] get a true Revelation two Spirits within
[12:03] a framework of the Christian church and
[12:06] by God's spirit what
[12:07] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[12:10] Satan will be powerless before her
[12:12] that he'll even be as dwarf as he was in
[12:15] the time of Jesus Christ
[12:17] do we believe that
[12:21] well I just can't see you
[12:24] wowzy wowzy woo that's what brother 40
[12:28] says
[12:29] you know
[12:31] but you know what
[12:33] I gotta tell you a lot of time about the
[12:35] man that told brother molts and why they
[12:37] didn't go out to the Moon they just went
[12:38] out you're in the desert somewhere
[12:42] but you know what
[12:43] you could have put him on a ship and
[12:45] sent him to the Moon he wouldn't have
[12:46] believed it
[12:49] because there's people that are just
[12:50] plain unbelievers oh they dope me up and
[12:53] done something you know
[12:55] see a lot of people have never believed
[12:57] it don't matter what
[12:59] they can't believe
[13:01] that's pitiful isn't it
[13:06] but listen what has been the purpose
[13:08] what we've been talking about
[13:11] a word for each age
[13:15] a messenger to bring the word we've been
[13:17] through seven churches
[13:19] and each messenger brought that message
[13:21] to that age but the people made the
[13:25] message alive amen
[13:27] or made it manifest
[13:29] the world didn't get upset
[13:31] even at the great Apostle Paul
[13:36] but when the people
[13:38] begin
[13:40] to talk like Paul
[13:43] amen and for God to be able to use them
[13:46] and things happen like it did in Paul
[13:48] not in the magnitude of one person no
[13:52] right
[13:55] see because it wasn't to be
[13:58] but what is the Greater Works that the
[14:00] prophet says we're to do he says now we
[14:02] can't do more Jesus because he died he
[14:04] done this he said because there's more
[14:05] of us
[14:08] more of us
[14:10] you know of course we're real good to
[14:12] quote
[14:13] we got to do the lesser works for we
[14:16] knew the Greater Works well praise the
[14:18] Lord
[14:19] go to work
[14:22] is there any problem with that statement
[14:26] you know
[14:27] I mean at least we could have a positive
[14:29] attitude right
[14:31] now look what he says here on number
[14:33] four about turn on the lights paragraph
[14:34] 35 and it meets that condition every
[14:37] time that God manifests his light
[14:40] the world itself rejects that life why
[14:43] it's written right in the Bible
[14:46] well they would reject it all like that
[14:48] right each age God has allotted so much
[14:51] of his word for each age and he always
[14:54] sends somebody
[14:56] to manifest
[14:57] that word
[15:01] he always sends somebody to manifest it
[15:04] right to make it known what is it going
[15:07] through three things he does
[15:10] she wanted him revealed makes it known
[15:13] in manifest Every Which Way that goes
[15:16] does it reveals it and then makes it
[15:18] manifest all right
[15:20] you see we're in the days of
[15:21] manifestation
[15:25] we're in the time of finishing it up
[15:28] if it hadn't have been for God sending a
[15:30] prophet
[15:31] that's where I love to read these things
[15:34] number five crisis Christ has identified
[15:36] the same of all ages and so in each age
[15:39] when God Lots his word for his age
[15:43] then when that word is ready to be
[15:45] manifested
[15:46] Now search the scriptures don't just
[15:49] take my word when that word is ready to
[15:51] be manifested then God sends down a
[15:54] prophet and reveals a word
[15:57] to his people
[15:58] well amen
[16:01] because that's the way we get it
[16:04] we get it my way of the Prophet
[16:06] messenger all right
[16:08] see then we got it in order
[16:12] look what he goes on to say in the
[16:14] unveiling of God
[16:15] I got 136.
[16:19] but this is spirit that comes upon the
[16:21] promised word for this age and brings
[16:23] forth and manifests
[16:26] listen not two tables of stone
[16:30] now what's he referring to
[16:34] ministering of the spirit back up above
[16:36] it read
[16:38] not the letter
[16:39] not two tables of stone
[16:42] not quotes
[16:45] but look but the presence of the Living
[16:48] God
[16:50] not a mythical thought somebody made up
[16:53] or some Houdini a trick
[16:55] but the very promise of God revealed and
[16:58] made manifest right before us
[17:02] think about her
[17:05] coach provided place of worship
[17:06] paragraph 110. and we find that in each
[17:10] age
[17:10] when God said a certain thing would
[17:12] happen here come that man alone and
[17:15] manifested that
[17:17] listen here come there are people alone
[17:21] and live that
[17:25] now what's he talking about
[17:27] you're talking about what we just read
[17:28] up above right
[17:30] that he sends a prophet
[17:33] that's what he's putting in the wording
[17:36] look
[17:37] here come that man along and manifested
[17:40] that he preached the message
[17:42] right
[17:44] here come their people
[17:47] under that messenger
[17:51] and live there
[17:53] that was God himself living in the
[17:55] people
[17:57] because it was an answering
[17:59] of his word
[18:02] see that's all I've tried to well
[18:04] everyone goes to the bottom I read it
[18:05] wrong again
[18:06] you read it
[18:10] but listen
[18:13] to try to see Who We Are
[18:20] we can talk about we believe that
[18:22] Luther's message
[18:24] we talk about we believe the Wesleyan
[18:26] message
[18:27] we talk about we believe the Pentecostal
[18:29] message
[18:32] we talk about we believe this message
[18:37] but what is this message
[18:43] see that's what I've tried to do with
[18:45] this series of trying to get us to
[18:48] recognize our day
[18:50] in its message
[18:52] me
[18:56] trying to get us to see ourselves
[18:59] all right we started out 18 messages ago
[19:03] talking on the Masterpiece family
[19:08] and in that we talked about the
[19:11] corn of wheat
[19:12] it died and went into the ground
[19:15] or it would have bought along and that
[19:16] was the Lord Jesus Christ the son of man
[19:21] and that came forth in the ages and then
[19:24] you come through the ages and there
[19:26] again the word dies and goes into the
[19:28] ground
[19:33] and comes out in two little shoots we
[19:36] call Luther
[19:38] you know stalked or something we call
[19:40] Wesley
[19:42] then we come to the shuck we call that
[19:44] the Pentecostals
[19:46] and then we talk about being back to
[19:48] grain again
[19:49] the original grain
[19:52] well see
[19:54] that to me then is each age or each
[19:57] group of people
[20:00] recognizing their age
[20:03] if not then we we'd be as his brother
[20:06] around and said that
[20:08] would have been something for
[20:12] Moses to come along and said well we've
[20:15] got to leave out of Egypt so it's a Nile
[20:16] River out here so we'll just build an
[20:19] ark
[20:20] that's what Noah done
[20:22] we're in the word we're building art
[20:25] we just have to be a little bigger
[20:28] you know
[20:29] well we got plenty of time
[20:33] we can build a good Ark
[20:36] but that wouldn't be recognizing their
[20:39] day
[20:42] the day they reckon it was the day they
[20:44] followed Moses out of Egypt
[20:46] right
[20:49] and see that's what I've tried to get
[20:51] you and I to see that that corn of wheat
[20:54] has got to come back to the original
[20:56] grain that went into the ground for a
[20:58] rapture
[21:01] right
[21:03] you remember that we spent all the time
[21:05] going through all of the things
[21:07] Masterpiece see not I would have shook
[21:10] all right
[21:11] then we begin to talk about
[21:16] how that
[21:18] the bride would come forth
[21:21] and in the end time to finish it all up
[21:26] that it would come out to be the
[21:28] fullness of the godhead bodily
[21:30] would be recognized in a bride
[21:33] to bring her to a rapture
[21:37] well yeah people don't want to talk
[21:38] about you talk about us being the
[21:39] foolish or the godhead by at SWAT
[21:41] brother Branham said we'd give the
[21:43] quotes
[21:43] if you want them call me write me I'll
[21:46] be glad to write them off but run in
[21:47] your computer
[21:49] this run in fullness of the godhead
[21:51] bodily
[21:53] and read
[21:57] one because
[21:58] what's going to bring about the rapture
[22:05] the prophet then he covers it real good
[22:07] and we gave it there where he said no
[22:10] leaven among you
[22:13] no denominational doctrines in other
[22:15] words
[22:16] brings the fullness of the godhead
[22:20] into a cry a bride
[22:26] see then if I've said things that the
[22:28] prophet didn't say let me know
[22:32] but if I said what he said at least you
[22:34] could amen what he said
[22:38] yeah
[22:41] but then we went from talking about the
[22:43] fullness of the godhead bodily
[22:46] we went on over into talking about the
[22:49] son of man
[22:51] that original grain that went into the
[22:53] ground would come back to the original
[22:54] grain again
[22:56] and be made manifest in a group of
[22:59] people
[23:01] in the end time
[23:02] Prophet bringing the message
[23:06] the bride
[23:08] to make it manifest
[23:10] all right
[23:11] then we went through talking about what
[23:17] that one standing in the midst of seven
[23:19] golden encounters like unto the son of
[23:21] man
[23:25] it was God
[23:27] right
[23:29] but everyone says there and we gave it
[23:31] said it's not a Prophet this is God
[23:34] but he was manifest in a
[23:37] many membered body
[23:40] called a bride
[23:42] remember that while we're in an honored
[23:44] denomination
[23:48] from standing are drawn out
[23:50] a bride
[23:54] right we didn't leave anybody out down
[23:56] to the ages to say that we were the only
[23:59] ones
[24:01] in the end time
[24:04] and let a lot of emphasis upon
[24:07] that you don't pull us apart from the
[24:09] rest
[24:11] we're not something special
[24:15] yeah we're just a special
[24:18] manifestation of God
[24:21] because that way all of the others are
[24:25] waiting on you and I Hebrews 11 40 right
[24:31] and see then all we got to do is become
[24:35] what the messengers talk
[24:39] is any problem with that
[24:42] urge you'd rather run a read a love
[24:45] story magazine or
[24:47] some story about something else
[24:52] worldly events and
[24:54] and we all look and read at different
[24:56] times guys
[24:59] but our emphasis should be upon the
[25:02] message that has been given unto us
[25:11] I don't care who's going to be president
[25:13] it'll be the one that God wants to be
[25:15] president
[25:17] I don't care where the pope comes from
[25:19] he comes from Gillsville Georgia I don't
[25:21] care
[25:27] he'd be the one God wants
[25:31] well
[25:33] he's in charge of everything
[25:36] well yet he's got a bride
[25:41] and that bride is going to be tried
[25:44] by the word
[25:47] is that right I believe it's what he
[25:49] said God of this evil age that the one
[25:50] where he said this bride will be tried
[25:53] to prove that she wouldn't fall
[25:56] like Eve did
[25:58] well
[26:03] I know I was thinking about that the
[26:04] other day and I said we talk about
[26:06] adoption we we talk about
[26:08] not praying for rain in a monsoon season
[26:11] a lot of people might not even know what
[26:12] in the world that means
[26:13] you know but it means when you're
[26:15] getting plenty of rain You Don't Pray
[26:17] For Rain you pray for it to stop
[26:21] right
[26:23] if you need and run you pray for rain
[26:26] all right and God can come on the scene
[26:28] and make that word manifest and we've
[26:31] seen that
[26:33] all right
[26:36] see recognizing Who We Are
[26:42] well and I'm just as honest as I can be
[26:45] now folks and try to be as much as I can
[26:50] but
[26:53] I don't believe we're the only people
[26:55] there are
[26:57] but I believe we've got to have our part
[27:01] I believe we've got to be our part of
[27:03] that body of Christ
[27:06] I believe around the world
[27:11] that God is manifesting himself
[27:15] in a many membered body
[27:20] called the bride of Christ
[27:23] the called out ones
[27:26] now bride's never been in an age nowhere
[27:29] that's everybody wants to talk about
[27:30] this and that yeah
[27:33] Luther was in the bright age
[27:35] but he was not in the age that he was
[27:37] living in physically he was but
[27:40] spiritually he was birthed out of that
[27:41] into the bride
[27:44] so we're never born again believer
[27:47] worked out of the age into the kingdom
[27:49] of God
[27:51] our kingdom is not of this world
[27:53] what do we care what they do
[28:00] see it's
[28:01] wanting to be right in the word
[28:06] to just find out who we are
[28:10] and thank God
[28:12] did it the scripture said it is he that
[28:15] hath made us and not we ourselves
[28:22] I remember we wasn't Rabbi Richmond
[28:24] talking about brother bisco at that time
[28:27] he said you know I can't help it if God
[28:29] chose me or Israel
[28:32] you know maybe a Jew I can't have power
[28:36] well
[28:38] so all you and I had to do with it was
[28:40] to accept this message when it crossed
[28:43] our path
[28:45] right
[28:47] and to see this is the word of the hour
[28:51] but now I hopefully admit
[28:54] with many doubts in my heart about why
[28:56] it is but
[28:58] to most of the people of this day
[29:02] it's recognized right around was a
[29:04] prophet that's that group going out of
[29:06] the way
[29:06] other group going this way
[29:11] right around was wrong here wrong here
[29:17] but what I don't understand I don't get
[29:19] it
[29:20] I'm honest
[29:22] man come here and preach he gets up here
[29:25] and he says run around is wrong
[29:27] well I'll try to hold it
[29:31] until he gets through
[29:32] because I do believe the word is true
[29:35] that spirit is subject to the prophets
[29:37] well you know what it may die he ain't
[29:39] no Prophet he's off the work but you
[29:41] know what you can't find out what a lot
[29:43] of people believe unless you let them
[29:45] open their mouth
[29:47] right right
[29:48] so the spirit Spud Victor him let him
[29:51] get up and run his big mouth
[29:54] but then when he gets through I say take
[29:57] your shoe off
[29:59] because if you can correct a prophet you
[30:02] must be God and I want to kiss your toe
[30:05] he said would you do that yeah oh and
[30:08] kisses though
[30:11] I might hit it with a hammer
[30:14] but my point is what
[30:19] when are we going to say to people
[30:21] that's not what the prophet says
[30:26] you that listen on the internet that's
[30:28] your choices
[30:30] but when somebody comes down there and
[30:31] said brother Rhino was false or running
[30:33] around was wrong here wrong there I'm
[30:36] not going to listen to that man again
[30:38] now if you do you're trying to get that
[30:41] bug on you
[30:44] come on
[30:46] you're trying to get the bugs trying to
[30:48] get on you and you're Latin it
[30:52] all right so yeah I'm sorry
[30:54] that's just the way I think
[30:56] well he said some good things so does
[30:59] the Baptist so does the Catholic
[31:04] The Beatles a lot of people thought they
[31:07] sound good I never did caring for it but
[31:10] I couldn't understand what they were
[31:11] saying
[31:13] I might have thought more of it if I
[31:14] could understood them
[31:18] but listen Church
[31:21] put it right down tonight now where
[31:23] we're at here
[31:25] and you I've done put now what I believe
[31:27] I believe around the world the bride of
[31:29] Christ is becoming
[31:31] the end time message now I believe that
[31:33] but it's our part here to just get our
[31:36] part right
[31:38] all right
[31:40] we're not to go out and convert them
[31:43] if they're preaching the truth they
[31:45] don't need to be converted
[31:48] that's not saying going don't go out and
[31:50] preach to them I didn't say that
[31:52] see that's what a lot of people think we
[31:54] got it here let's go get them bring them
[31:55] to Lula
[31:57] we don't need too many more little
[31:58] buildings sometime pretty full on
[32:00] Sundays
[32:02] and uh
[32:04] we are going to have seats sitting in
[32:06] these aisles and and big old screen
[32:09] downstairs where some can sit down there
[32:11] before we build on you know or build
[32:13] another building or something
[32:15] why go to there's no need of it because
[32:18] them kind of people
[32:20] they're going to come in and they're
[32:22] going to go out
[32:24] so you just let them come in go out
[32:27] you know
[32:29] see a lot of people can't just sit down
[32:31] and grind
[32:32] brother had a good illustration
[32:35] he said like a cat
[32:37] eating a grinding stone
[32:43] you say that's impossible
[32:46] no it's not
[32:49] that cat's tongue don't get in trouble
[32:51] because it's going to be wore out a lot
[32:54] but if one grain comes off every time
[32:57] that cat touches that grinding stone
[33:00] the grinding Stone's going away
[33:04] it's where God does great things
[33:07] he draws billions of gallons of water
[33:09] every day out of the oceans and seasons
[33:12] and never makes a bit of racket
[33:17] what was it the prophet said one
[33:20] hundredth of one percent or something
[33:21] out he gave it recognize Jesus when he
[33:25] was here
[33:26] some big great outstanding number was
[33:30] all that you know I mean not a big
[33:32] number it's small very small number
[33:34] recognized
[33:37] the Lord Jesus
[33:41] brother Branham was more
[33:44] recognized probably by the world
[33:47] than any messenger that's ever been
[33:51] because of the gifts and the things it
[33:54] was in his life
[33:58] still
[34:00] it wasn't seven billion people
[34:03] that heard the message
[34:05] but what has that got to do with
[34:07] anything
[34:09] well brother Dale and brothers I don't
[34:11] agree with you so what
[34:14] I want them to know I don't agree with
[34:16] them
[34:18] I mean
[34:19] that's why I'm just honest
[34:21] and straightforward
[34:24] fault I don't have time play
[34:30] ain't Kevin when I said if we don't
[34:32] hurry up we're going to be having
[34:33] services in a nursing home
[34:36] right
[34:39] well we're getting older folks
[34:44] a lot of us in here are already Pious
[34:46] what God promised us
[34:49] right
[34:52] and a lot of you are chasing close on
[34:54] our heels
[34:58] but recognizing Who We Are
[35:03] why can't we say we're the bride
[35:08] but like I said
[35:10] about the raising the hand part I
[35:12] believe I'm born again but I don't know
[35:13] where I'm into bride or not
[35:15] now that's
[35:18] that's
[35:21] forgiveness to say in Low Mentality
[35:25] I'm trying to get away from that word
[35:26] stupid word Josiah
[35:29] I'm trying to get away from calling him
[35:30] things
[35:35] but when are we going to start
[35:37] behaving like
[35:40] the message
[35:42] that has been given us
[35:47] to love these people that are off the
[35:50] word
[35:52] is that the way brother Ryan said it he
[35:53] said somebody at all then to come in he
[35:55] said
[35:56] sit down among you if he said love them
[36:00] he says they'll go out or come in one
[36:03] right but you loving them
[36:05] when he made that statement that day
[36:07] about
[36:09] he said I'd rather see love in a church
[36:11] than to see 5 000 people saved
[36:16] I thought oh
[36:20] let me listen
[36:22] he said because if you've got love in a
[36:23] church there'd be ten thousand or what a
[36:27] number used way up
[36:31] but to recognize Who We Are
[36:34] nobody in the Bible
[36:37] down to the church ages or anything I've
[36:40] made this statement over and over ever
[36:42] amounted to anything
[36:44] until they recognized who they were
[36:50] Martin Luther was a good guy
[36:53] but he was just one of the guys in the
[36:57] in the conventor of what you call them
[37:02] but yet when God come into man's heart
[37:07] you know that Martin Luther become known
[37:09] worldwide
[37:13] right
[37:14] amen
[37:17] brother Brandon what was it the little
[37:19] Kentuckian
[37:21] seventh grade education
[37:27] he said he used to it didn't even have
[37:29] no clothes
[37:30] wanted to get me an old 30 30 where I
[37:32] could go out west and become a guide you
[37:35] know and
[37:38] couldn't afford it
[37:42] he said friends wouldn't even talk to me
[37:46] go down the street they wouldn't even
[37:47] talk to me
[37:49] he said now I got guns some pretty nice
[37:52] ones
[37:56] and he said
[37:58] now I have to hide
[38:01] to be able to get a little rest
[38:04] because everybody won't talk to him
[38:08] right
[38:10] you know what
[38:12] can't you recognize what
[38:14] was said to David
[38:16] and David
[38:18] I took you from taking care of an old
[38:20] handful of sheep
[38:25] he did a major King
[38:30] no wonder the man loved God
[38:34] look what he's doing with him
[38:37] look what he's done for you and I
[38:41] established us in a word position until
[38:45] we don't have all that garbage can
[38:47] coming through
[38:49] trying to preach false Doctrine and get
[38:51] us lit off
[38:57] a name
[39:00] may be that we're intellectual word
[39:04] people
[39:06] you know they don't realize that's
[39:08] bragging on me
[39:10] I mean you know I can call you whatever
[39:12] you want to to me that's bragging
[39:15] to say you ain't nothing but word word
[39:17] word
[39:19] that's bragging keep on
[39:23] because that's all I do I love the word
[39:25] of God
[39:26] but I love to see it in the people
[39:31] as it controls us
[39:35] that's the only thing I can see that
[39:37] a rapture
[39:39] how do you get these virtues back here
[39:40] we're going to need them to go into
[39:41] Rapture right how do we get them
[39:48] what was it about 1980 where the Lord
[39:51] opened that up to me and said
[39:53] by the opening of the word
[39:56] the preaching of the seals and the
[39:58] things the message of prophet brought
[40:00] the opening of the word will bring the
[40:02] virtues
[40:04] well
[40:06] we're not going to get them studying
[40:07] Greer's Almanac
[40:12] well I'll just pray myself into it you
[40:15] know I'll fast myself into it go ahead
[40:20] we read our minute ago the prophet said
[40:22] it's not just
[40:23] you know letters
[40:26] it's a revelation
[40:29] the revelation of Jesus Christ and where
[40:31] he's at
[40:33] he's in you sister Gail
[40:36] well if I could just see Jesus
[40:39] open your blinded eyes
[40:42] and look around
[40:46] you see what I've been trying to say
[40:48] then
[40:50] not selling you something that the
[40:52] prophet didn't say we were and really
[40:54] matter of fact I withheld a lot of
[40:56] things if you just go in the message and
[40:58] read it
[40:59] to start in 63 especially 64. read the
[41:03] whole message series from there on out
[41:06] and see if that's not what he's talking
[41:08] about the grain of wheat the the
[41:10] fullness of the godhead the son of man
[41:17] and see if that's not what he's talking
[41:18] about
[41:22] a bride
[41:25] then think about it as I said so get
[41:27] ready now for somebody to
[41:29] think about
[41:31] what we said
[41:35] blue okay
[41:37] think about what we've tried to bring
[41:41] to recognize Who We Are
[41:44] our day in this message
[41:47] and to see what God's doing
[41:49] in this day
[41:52] Luther's done his day Wesley's done his
[41:54] day Pentecost has done his day we went
[41:56] through all of that we wrote around and
[41:58] said even a
[42:00] zusa Street represented Mary back there
[42:02] that was a carrier
[42:05] who said she was not the words she was a
[42:07] carrier
[42:09] but the word was inside of her
[42:12] I said one day then he had to come out
[42:15] and manifest himself
[42:17] okay we recognize Pentecostals in all
[42:20] the days and hours that we're living
[42:25] and we see it in the truth like us tried
[42:27] to bring out the brother even calls the
[42:29] Holy Ghost fell on Azusa Street 1906
[42:32] calls it to genuine baptism of the Holy
[42:35] Ghost
[42:35] you call it
[42:37] the prophet
[42:40] another great prophet
[42:45] right
[42:47] well I just don't believe that well
[42:49] you're not doubting me
[42:54] if I read to you what brought around say
[42:57] it you're not doubting me
[43:00] well you only read part of it well bring
[43:04] me the other part
[43:08] I've always been open
[43:12] to just do one thing and that's bring to
[43:14] you when I believe God has given to me
[43:16] into my heart
[43:17] and this is not a new thing of just 18
[43:20] sermons we preached on this I was
[43:22] preaching this in the 70s
[43:28] the dean brought me some cassettes the
[43:30] other day from back somewhere back in
[43:32] there and I was talking about faith
[43:34] 77 talking about faith
[43:37] we just didn't get into Daniel 70 weeks
[43:40] three years ago
[43:45] we were into that in the 70s
[43:48] and then I've told you and people think
[43:50] that's just you existing exhaust 19 and
[43:52] 69 in Athens Georgia
[43:54] that was my first sermon in this message
[43:57] that the Bride of Jesus Christ would be
[44:00] peace on a man
[44:04] the word made flesh in the end time
[44:07] you think I don't believe that more
[44:09] today than I did then
[44:13] what just keeps unfolding
[44:17] I can see now what it's going to take
[44:19] for you and I to get out of here you
[44:21] know what it's going to take
[44:22] somebody ready for the question you know
[44:25] what it's going to tell you and I are
[44:26] becoming the word
[44:30] and how do you become the word I see
[44:33] what is it uh I'll get it in a minute
[44:35] he said you become the word as you
[44:37] receive the word
[44:39] might be in perfect faith
[44:42] if you become the word as you receive
[44:44] the word
[44:46] but we sat down on our Hops and just
[44:49] play church and go to church and be good
[44:51] people and do everything else that's
[44:53] well and good
[44:55] or we can struggle it out
[44:59] and fight it out
[45:01] of our own natural we ways and beings
[45:05] to try to become what God wants us to be
[45:11] he's coming back after the word
[45:16] because that's what it's always been
[45:19] giving God to glory and honor for
[45:21] everything
[45:24] I saw something the other day I told my
[45:25] wife about it
[45:28] but you see I'm not afraid
[45:32] I've always preached what I believe
[45:36] not afraid
[45:39] I have no fear about the message that
[45:42] I've tried to preach
[45:45] I have no fear about somebody coming and
[45:47] attacking it and tearing it down
[45:51] don't have to do a lot of tactin for 50
[45:53] years almost
[45:57] and you know a lot of you ain't like I
[45:59] am you know I've talked to people years
[46:01] ago I used to I don't get to talk nobody
[46:03] no more I reckon they just count me out
[46:04] and don't worry about it that's all
[46:06] right
[46:08] but I've sat down and talked with people
[46:13] I felt so sorry for him
[46:15] until they would try to quote something
[46:18] and they couldn't even quote it and tell
[46:20] you where it was at
[46:21] well brother Brown said so I said that's
[46:24] on page 444 something I would tell them
[46:27] where it was at
[46:30] you know
[46:32] because I felt so sorry for him they
[46:34] couldn't even quote
[46:37] I said well you'll find that right there
[46:38] you know here's a book read it
[46:41] you know
[46:42] why yeah
[46:45] if you're afraid of somebody quoting
[46:47] something contrary to your quote what
[46:50] you got
[46:51] I believe they all come together and
[46:53] make a beautiful picture
[46:59] who will be first
[47:01] questions comments talks
[47:05] someone out there on the internet call
[47:07] in Joe's on the phone
[47:12] because I'm not afraid
[47:15] I saw that and I said Thank You Lord
[47:20] saw something else but I just explained
[47:23] that to my wife but I'll leave that
[47:25] alone God it has nothing to do with
[47:27] anything
[47:28] we have something to do with me
[47:35] you see church if you know where you're
[47:37] standing you're not afraid
[47:41] when you don't know where you're
[47:42] standing you're scared to death
[47:46] right
[47:49] who'll be first to say
[47:52] anybody
[47:55] tell me what you believe Brother Dean
[47:58] you know tell me what you believe
[48:02] that's
[48:06] it
[48:14] I'll tell you what what I see out of the
[48:18] series you you preached it I see you
[48:22] bringing the form of God all the way
[48:25] back from in the back of God's mind
[48:28] before the foundation work right brought
[48:30] to form
[48:31] and the way the form was and what it did
[48:36] it the people that that received that
[48:40] form it's a mystery you've been bringing
[48:42] a mystery right all the way back before
[48:45] I mean before the foundation World
[48:47] exactly it's it the mystery has been
[48:49] it's been in the form of God and what
[48:53] God was doing like in the prophets
[48:54] exactly see it was it was going on the
[48:57] form of God was gone but there was a
[48:58] people that believed Isaiah these are
[49:01] people that believed Ezekiel and this is
[49:04] what he was doing he's he's coming down
[49:07] through his by his form or the form he's
[49:10] in from from Genesis 1 26 27 right you
[49:15] preached and Wade preached a lot see the
[49:17] mystery has been coming down in the
[49:20] mystery is what you've been preaching
[49:21] right I mean and I hope the people I
[49:24] mean I mean I could be here a week
[49:27] talking on this here but I know I got to
[49:30] move on but see you you brought to you
[49:34] brought to promise you brought the Lord
[49:35] Jesus Christ over the scene you brought
[49:37] what he done on the scene yeah it in the
[49:40] form of that and you brought to church
[49:41] ages you brought to seals you brought to
[49:44] Trumpets it's all in the message in this
[49:47] 18 just this 18 not counting all the
[49:50] rest of them but just in this 18. it's
[49:53] there so if people that don't understand
[49:55] the Mysteries
[49:57] ought to get busy
[49:59] they are to really
[50:01] seek God because I'll save myself you
[50:05] preached a lot of things over the years
[50:06] to me
[50:08] and it's things that I at the time I
[50:11] couldn't understand you'd say things and
[50:14] I'd meditate I'd pray and I was so
[50:17] desperate because I had confidence in I
[50:20] believed that it was a truth but I
[50:23] didn't understand it and I stayed that
[50:25] way until God revealed it to me and this
[50:29] is what I'm talking about and I don't
[50:31] know
[50:32] I I can't do it no justice is all
[50:35] because 18 18 sermons is is is and I
[50:40] just see it it's like that Roman Candle
[50:44] just exploding and God revealing to me
[50:48] see that mystery that come from back
[50:52] before the foundation of the world Amen
[50:54] because you can't add nothing to God and
[50:56] you can't take nothing from God but
[50:58] there's a people up here that's
[51:00] predestinated by the foreknowledge of
[51:03] God and they see that they are this is
[51:06] what I see Brother Sam they see that
[51:09] they are elected God elected them
[51:12] and and and when they see it from the
[51:15] baptism of the Holy Ghost that you've
[51:17] been speaking of by the Dynamics that
[51:19] ain't nobody thinks is going on
[51:22] they see it by that and God by that
[51:26] takes them back to where he put their
[51:28] names on the Lamb's Book of Life before
[51:30] the foundation of the world
[51:33] and then he shows them his Destiny so I
[51:37] I just I just I just I would I would ask
[51:40] the people to look at the form of God
[51:43] right how he
[51:45] he God I mean how can you put it in the
[51:48] words bro Sam the mystery that I say
[51:52] right that's coming up through that I
[51:54] mean you could I couldn't I could I
[51:56] could stay here for a week and talk
[51:58] about what I see on what you preach just
[52:01] these 18 servers so but it's a it's a
[52:04] four I would say the form of God and the
[52:07] form of God's people amen all the way
[52:10] down he did this is what it come for I
[52:13] mean the whole picture of God is what
[52:16] you is what you preached right here in
[52:17] these 18 sermons amen God bless you
[52:21] Maria
[52:22] h
[52:24] and really
[52:30] the worst one
[52:33] but God has worked for me and I want
[52:36] everybody here to know about it yeah I
[52:38] can sit here tonight and tell you I am a
[52:42] part of the son of man
[52:45] I believe that
[52:47] folks if you're looking for something
[52:49] from God
[52:50] stop looking for some great big
[52:52] something right God is the only being
[52:56] that can get as simple as he gets and
[53:01] yet it is so magnificent as Brother Dean
[53:04] said words don't explain it I can't
[53:07] I read through the Mighty God unveiled
[53:09] and I was catching things as Brother Sam
[53:11] was preaching
[53:13] I run across the paragraph there or two
[53:15] one day
[53:19] I can't say God spoke to me out loud
[53:21] yeah
[53:23] but I knew just as well when I finished
[53:25] those couple of paragraphs
[53:28] that God had told me that was mine
[53:31] that I had it and you can't shake me
[53:34] from it now folks and if you're in that
[53:37] place keep going right pray for
[53:39] Revelation Gloria brother Dean's right
[53:43] there ain't there one of us sitting here
[53:45] desperate enough and I don't know
[53:46] whether we're going to get desperate
[53:47] enough or not till God beats his eye to
[53:50] death right but if that's what it takes
[53:52] so be it
[53:53] God has been most merciful to all of us
[53:57] I could look at me and I thought the
[53:59] other day I thought well this and that
[54:00] and the other about what's going on
[54:03] and I got to thinking on something about
[54:05] somebody else well I ain't got no
[54:07] problems right
[54:09] right but I just want to say that I
[54:11] appreciate you brother and I love you I
[54:13] love the Lord and I appreciate what he's
[54:16] done for me and don't look for no big
[54:18] boys
[54:20] and if you get something comes to you
[54:22] and you're not real sure just keep
[54:23] talking to him and meditating about it
[54:25] reading he'll Quicken it to you
[54:28] somewhere right it's like saying don't
[54:31] lost in quicksilvers guys he said I'll
[54:34] help you but you got to try right
[54:36] a lot of word in that that's true right
[54:39] amen
[54:41] brother Hank
[54:46] what's today oh
[54:51] I don't know uh I see something here and
[54:54] every time every time and I come here
[54:56] and I hear you
[54:57] I get a sense of peace and my life fell
[54:59] apart but everybody at this church
[55:01] has helped me and blessed me and the
[55:04] message that you put out there it gets
[55:05] clear every time I come and I thank you
[55:08] for that I thank God for you amen I
[55:11] thank God for Dawn and Susan and Mark
[55:13] and everybody in this place amen because
[55:15] everybody here has not turned their head
[55:18] when I walk by
[55:19] they've looked dead at me yeah and I
[55:22] appreciate that and I love every one of
[55:23] y'all amen I see what y'all got and I
[55:26] want some of it amen amen
[55:31] that's a good call me
[55:34] it'll be next
[55:37] just be salty
[55:39] it'll make you thirsty
[55:42] who'll be next
[55:43] I get up this morning and I generally
[55:45] get up and fix breakfast for my wife you
[55:47] know she'll be doing something I just
[55:49] cooked the breakfast and
[55:51] I'm good at cooking eggs and bacon at
[55:53] least I can do that you know but I got
[55:56] in there this morning I was thinking
[55:57] about that salty knife
[56:00] I've put a little salt in the eggs and
[56:03] I got too much
[56:06] she don't know it I turned around and
[56:08] throwed them out and cooked her some
[56:10] more because I didn't want her eating
[56:13] them salty eggs
[56:14] now that's too salty and I think we
[56:17] can't be too salty in the Lord who'll be
[56:19] next anybody with a comment thought
[56:22] questions or anything yet
[56:30] everybody happy
[56:33] I believe the word don't you I've always
[56:36] believed it and always wanted to do one
[56:37] thing
[56:39] and that's all I want to do is just see
[56:41] somebody
[56:42] receive the word
[56:44] it's your brain
[56:46] I don't have the ministries of these
[56:48] other brothers I'm not uh you know
[56:51] it bothers me that I don't have the kind
[56:55] of humbleness and the form of
[56:59] of anointings and things that these some
[57:02] of these brothers have and I I cherish
[57:05] that and I'm not joking now
[57:07] I cherish it and honor it
[57:09] but I'm just me
[57:11] and that's all it can be amen there's no
[57:15] need of trying to be anything else
[57:18] I've always just been honest and sincere
[57:21] about what I am
[57:22] but my point is not what I am is what
[57:25] you are
[57:26] to get you to see who you are
[57:31] the new birth is wonderful
[57:33] because that's the only way we'd never
[57:34] start I mean you can't even talk about
[57:36] it until you get to New Birth let's see
[57:39] the new birth is your baby
[57:44] that's wonderful
[57:46] but then you got to grow up
[57:50] and to see God work and do as he has
[57:53] Among Us
[57:54] in Mighty ways
[57:58] it's great for me anybody else before we
[58:01] go
