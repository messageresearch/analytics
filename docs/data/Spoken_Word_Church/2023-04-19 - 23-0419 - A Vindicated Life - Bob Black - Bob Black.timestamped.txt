[12:43] good to be in the house of the Lord
[12:45] tonight God bless you all
[12:48] and I sure enjoyed that special
[12:50] you know when God speaks something it'll
[12:52] things Begin to Fall in in the line
[12:55] don't they you think that if God can can
[12:57] create a world and create the universe
[12:59] by his word and can control the planets
[13:02] and things what can he can do with your
[13:03] life if you get in this objection to the
[13:05] word
[13:06] that God can control your life by the
[13:08] word
[13:10] we just want to read tonight from The
[13:11] Book of Revelation chapter four
[13:13] um
[13:15] and uh you know we were we were planning
[13:17] to be out of town this weekend but it

[13:28] but keep that little group in prayer um
[13:30] they kind of been having a rough time
[13:32] with that so
[13:34] um it's you know it's a thing
[13:37] but we've gotta we've got a miracle
[13:39] working God that's on the scene but I
[13:42] want to um uh you're probably not going
[13:45] to be surprised what scripture I'm gonna
[13:46] preach from tonight we'll just preach
[13:48] from Revelation 4 again and and take a a
[13:51] little different angle maybe just speak
[13:53] on a Vindicated life
[13:55] amen Lord God we're so grateful to be
[13:58] able to gather once more around your
[13:59] word Lord and come together Lord right
[14:01] here in the middle of the week and
[14:02] everybody's traveling from Far Lord to
[14:05] gather together and get a little
[14:06] encouragement and I pray God that you'll
[14:08] give him what they need tonight Lord
[14:09] Jesus that you'll speak something Lord
[14:11] it'll be helpful and edifying Lord it'll
[14:13] Lord power him through Lord Jesus and
[14:16] give them something to to know a little
[14:18] bit more of what we're doing here and
[14:20] how to get out of here we thank you Lord
[14:22] Jesus for your grace that you've given
[14:24] unto us in this hour Lord and we just
[14:25] invite you in to move Among Us Lord
[14:27] because Lord surely Lord we can teach
[14:29] your word but Lord it takes the spirit
[14:31] to Quicken it to us and make it a living
[14:33] reality Lord we just ask you Lord that
[14:36] you'll feel welcome here Among Us Lord
[14:37] and move to move in this place Lord and
[14:40] and just help us Grant it now Lord we
[14:42] ask your blessing on on your word and
[14:44] your name amen
[14:46] so in Revelation chapter 4 verse 1 it
[14:49] says
[14:50] after this I looked and behold the door
[14:53] was open in heaven and the first voice
[14:55] which I heard was as it were of a
[14:57] trumpet talking with me which said come
[15:00] up hither and I will show you these
[15:01] things which must be hereafter
[15:04] and immediately I was in the spirit and
[15:06] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[15:08] one said on the throne
[15:11] now you think about what this what kind
[15:13] of scene this is opening up here I I
[15:15] just pray that we can really see the
[15:18] scene as the way that look at it like
[15:20] John looked at it that something's
[15:22] happening and he that set was to look
[15:24] upon like a Jasper and a sergeant Stone
[15:26] and there was a rainbow round about the
[15:29] throne in sight like unto an emerald you
[15:32] may be seated the Lord at his Blessing
[15:34] to the reading of the word
[15:37] now as we've been speaking the last few
[15:39] times I kind of talked on this scripture
[15:41] that that John Heard a Voice and you you
[15:43] think that John John after all that this
[15:46] church ages had been opened up and and
[15:48] uh in the last chapter that that John
[15:52] looked and he heard a he he saw a door
[15:54] was opened up in heaven and you know
[15:56] brother Brown will explain all these all
[15:58] these symbols to us that that uh that
[16:00] door was when when how you think about
[16:03] how how this situation that we're into
[16:05] tonight that you know you're down here
[16:07] in your carnality and you're you're
[16:09] you're going through life and you're
[16:11] you're you know maybe sitting here
[16:12] tonight you just start examining
[16:14] yourself and and you think think of all
[16:16] the problems you got and all the all the
[16:18] things that you don't like you don't
[16:19] like about yourself and you think well I
[16:21] wish that I could get rid of these
[16:23] things well God has made a way and you
[16:26] see John that's what really what John
[16:28] was looking at he's looking at that door
[16:29] that was opened up in heaven and how how
[16:31] are we going to get out of here tonight
[16:33] I I want to I you know there's problems
[16:36] in our lives and things that are wrong
[16:37] in our lives and things that need to be
[16:39] corrected and I thank God that he has
[16:41] given us a way to correct our fallen
[16:43] nature to correct our countenality
[16:45] correct everything about us and a way to
[16:48] to get out of here so that we can if we
[16:50] just looked at him look because Christ
[16:52] is the door Christ is the door and how
[16:54] do you get through the door it's through
[16:56] faith faith is the key that opens the
[16:58] door so how's John how did John get up
[17:01] through that door how are you and I
[17:03] going to get up through that doors
[17:06] Revelation a personal revelation to us
[17:09] of who Jesus Christ is and you see as
[17:13] Christ is revealed that as a side effect
[17:16] of that as Christ is revealed and
[17:18] because you're part of Christ you are
[17:20] revealed too so as he's being revealed
[17:23] then you are being revealed and then
[17:25] that gives you that's really what the
[17:27] seals are to do as the as Christ as God
[17:30] pulled the cover off of the whole thing
[17:32] then it begins to reveal to you who you
[17:35] are and that what that to reveal to you
[17:38] that that that what God has done for you
[17:40] that God has taken you from a place
[17:43] where you were incarnality and your own
[17:45] messed up condition that that like we've
[17:48] been talking about in Sunday school that
[17:49] that uh you uh all that stuff that
[17:53] happened in the Garden of Eden to get us
[17:55] into the place that we were we were and
[17:56] we needed to be redeemed and God come
[17:59] down and died for us on the cross and
[18:01] filled us with the Holy Ghost and took
[18:02] us from changes from this to this to
[18:05] this until finally you can look look
[18:07] like John did and look and see a door
[18:09] opened in heaven one day we're going to
[18:11] have to come to that place where we can
[18:13] get out of here we you've got to come to
[18:16] a place where you you're you're not just
[18:18] guessing and probing and wondering if
[18:20] we're going to be able to take a body
[18:21] change but you know that you're gonna
[18:23] step out of here step out of this room
[18:26] so John heard a voice and it was calling
[18:28] him up here and he heard a voice that
[18:30] was clear and distinct and brother Adam
[18:33] said it was the same voice that spoke to
[18:36] her it spoke to him here on Earth what
[18:38] what can we get out of that it's the
[18:40] same voice yeah we sometimes we want to
[18:42] make it so complicated and things but
[18:44] you see it was the same voice all the
[18:47] time it's the same voice that called you
[18:49] that first little camp meeting you were
[18:51] in that personal situation maybe
[18:53] somebody was witnessing to you and you
[18:55] begin to hear that tongue of God on your
[18:57] life and it wasn't the man talking to
[19:00] you but it was the voice of God in your
[19:03] heart speaking to you and and he said
[19:06] same voice that's been calling you all
[19:08] along it's the same voice that's
[19:10] speaking to you here tonight that's
[19:12] calling you that's identifying you with
[19:14] the scripture because you know you've
[19:16] got to have you got to have an
[19:17] identified life you've got to have a
[19:20] Vindicated life that's what I'm speaking
[19:22] of tonight
[19:23] oh you you look at like you look at John
[19:26] what the life that that man lived that
[19:29] that that John John uh John typified the
[19:34] kind of person that's going to it's
[19:36] going to take to go in a Rapture John
[19:39] John was the eagle of the Matthew Mark
[19:42] Luke John he was you can see to follow
[19:44] that plan through the the first four the
[19:46] first four gospels that went from Lion
[19:49] ox man and eagle and and John typified
[19:52] the eagle who who was lifted up in his
[19:54] Revelation Who had who had a a greater
[19:57] understanding maybe than the the way
[19:59] that everybody else would look at it and
[20:01] that's the same way that a born-again
[20:02] believer in this age is going to have to
[20:04] come it's gonna you're gonna have to be
[20:05] lifted up not lifted up Beyond just
[20:08] being born again and lifted up Beyond
[20:10] just being going up the stature perfect
[20:13] man but lifted up into the promises of a
[20:15] Capstone Revelation where you know what
[20:18] God is doing where you understand these
[20:21] things and you see the whole time it was
[20:23] the same voice and brother Adam would
[20:25] say he was in the candy speaking from
[20:28] them to his church the voice the voice
[20:31] was the voice of Christ
[20:33] now now think tonight let's let's think
[20:35] let's meditate on these things I just
[20:38] want to kind of talk to you tonight to
[20:40] think what what is it going to take to
[20:42] go in the Rapture now now what what is
[20:44] it what kind of person is it going to
[20:46] take you you think tonight about all our
[20:49] problems and things about maybe
[20:50] differences between one another and
[20:52] problems with marital problems and just
[20:55] whatever whatever it might be there's
[20:56] always problems I I'm not I'm not trying
[20:59] to you know I'm tonight I'm not running
[21:01] after I'm not trying to attack nothing
[21:03] so let's just be at Liberty and I'm not
[21:05] coming after nothing but you know we've
[21:08] all got problems but you see you can't
[21:10] take you can't take your grudges and
[21:12] things with you you got to lay those
[21:14] weights down you got to get rid of those
[21:16] things you see that's the picture that
[21:19] John was John was love love and you got
[21:23] to have so much love love for one
[21:25] another that you don't even care if
[21:27] somebody smites you on your cheek you
[21:29] don't care what someone what you see
[21:30] maybe let's restate that sometimes you
[21:33] can here it hurts but you see Love Will
[21:36] project love love projects when it you
[21:39] it's something Supernatural taking place
[21:42] and you can't how are you going to go in
[21:44] the Rapture with grudges and anger and
[21:48] bitterness and bitter towards one
[21:50] another can't forgive one another you
[21:52] see love can forgive somebody when it
[21:55] looks like how are you going to forgive
[21:56] how you how can you forgive but love
[21:58] will come in and take over and forgive
[22:01] somebody when it looks like there's no
[22:02] way
[22:04] how are we going to take it go in the
[22:06] Rapture you can't take your carnality in
[22:09] the Rapture you can't take your you
[22:11] can't take your pride you can't take
[22:13] your enmity you can't take all of your
[22:15] bad feelings what's it going to take to
[22:18] go in the Rapture it's going to take
[22:20] Oneness Oneness with God the same word
[22:25] the same word that was sown in the
[22:28] beginning the same life
[22:30] the same character the same love I'm
[22:35] talking about the same love that could
[22:37] be hanging up on the cross and say
[22:38] father forgive them that kind of love
[22:41] I'm talking about the kind of love that
[22:42] could be there in the Garden of
[22:44] Gethsemane saying father not my will but
[22:46] thine be done oh when we want it we want
[22:49] to accomplish a purpose for our own
[22:51] selves but to lay down that that
[22:53] selfishness and where you just want to
[22:56] do something for your own prosperity to
[22:58] lay that down and say God whatever you
[23:00] want me to do that's what I want to do
[23:03] whatever you want me to go that's where
[23:05] I want to go that's what's going to take
[23:07] to go in the rapture
[23:09] foreign
[23:11] [Applause]
[23:13] why why will it take that because the
[23:15] Bride of the Bride that's going to go in
[23:17] the Rapture is going to be just like
[23:20] Jesus I'm talking about a life just like
[23:24] Jesus a character just like Jesus a life
[23:28] that is exactly like Jesus Oh you see
[23:31] when we study these things out that's on
[23:33] this board behind me these aren't just
[23:35] things to learn but these are things
[23:37] that must be projected in your life the
[23:39] character of Christ demonstrated through
[23:42] you the same Temperance the same ability
[23:46] to control your emotions to control your
[23:50] reaction to a situation the same
[23:52] patience the ability to wait on God and
[23:56] wait for your brother and sister that
[23:58] might be upset with you and might not be
[24:00] at the place that you think they ought
[24:02] to be but you wait on them because the
[24:05] same life that was in Christ is in you
[24:08] the bride is going to be just like Jesus
[24:11] Jesus
[24:12] oh you think well that's a tall order
[24:14] tonight but but yet God has given us the
[24:17] recipe and it's laying here in the pages
[24:19] that's why when I'm preaching tonight to
[24:22] you from Revelation chapter four I'm not
[24:24] just preaching something to learn about
[24:26] I'm not just preaching something that
[24:29] John knew that he had studied about but
[24:31] something that John saw my Revelation
[24:34] it's got to come by Revelation and you
[24:37] realize that your character your
[24:40] character is actually connected to your
[24:42] Revelation that's why Revelation is so
[24:44] important as these things are revealed
[24:47] to you precept upon precept word upon
[24:50] word line upon line it's actually
[24:52] changing who you are to be like Jesus
[24:57] oh Lord
[24:59] his voice his voice is actually changing
[25:04] your character oh you think tonight well
[25:06] I don't know why we need to come to
[25:09] church well that's why because I want my
[25:11] character to be changed I don't know why
[25:14] we need to be gathered around one
[25:16] together I don't know why we don't can't
[25:18] just sit at home because because I I
[25:21] want my character to be changed I I
[25:23] don't know about you but there's a lot
[25:25] of things still in my life that I find
[25:27] that are lacking things that I want to
[25:29] be able to lay down and the only way
[25:31] that we're going to get rid of them is
[25:33] not by our own efforts or by our own
[25:35] works but by submitting to the voice of
[25:38] God what voice are you talking about
[25:39] tonight brother Bob I'm talking about
[25:41] that voice that John heard the voice
[25:44] that's been dealing with you in your
[25:46] whole Christian Journey that voice that
[25:48] voice is changing you that voice is
[25:51] changing it's correcting your character
[25:53] it's correcting who you were and
[25:56] changing it to what God saw you would be
[25:59] before the foundation of the world
[26:02] brother Brown said so when you surrender
[26:06] your complete being
[26:08] oh when you surrender your complete
[26:10] being how many wants to do that tonight
[26:13] to Just Surrender everything about us my
[26:17] soul and my spirit and my body surrender
[26:20] it all so he can change it all oh
[26:22] there's the secret of the Rapture right
[26:24] there
[26:25] so he can change it all my body my soul
[26:29] and my spirit and body
[26:31] so when you surrender your complete
[26:33] being then the Holy Spirit just pours
[26:35] through you in these virtues then you're
[26:39] a living Tabernacle
[26:41] then people look out and say that's a
[26:43] man full of virtue knowledge he believes
[26:46] the word Temperance patience godliness
[26:50] Broly kindness full of the love of the
[26:52] Holy Ghost see there he is
[26:55] walking around
[26:57] there he is a candidate to go in the
[27:00] rapture
[27:02] and I was I was thinking about you know
[27:04] that story that
[27:05] of Noah and the Ark you think about how
[27:08] Noah built that Ark and he got brother
[27:10] Ram said he would get that's your team
[27:12] wood and then he would pitch it and the
[27:15] Bible talks about that he would pitch it
[27:16] pitch it fill it up with that that pine
[27:19] tar and put that in that chateem wood
[27:23] now you think about that now
[27:25] that it started out as your team would
[27:28] but brother Brian when he explained that
[27:30] he said you put that pine tar in it
[27:32] and it ain't your teamwood anymore
[27:35] it's Pine
[27:37] why because the spirit will change you
[27:41] now that's what I'm talking about here
[27:43] tonight that that it behooves us to look
[27:46] at our life and see if our life Compares
[27:50] with the scripture
[27:52] because if you have a true revelation of
[27:54] the word of God it's going to change
[27:57] your life it's unavoidable because a
[28:00] revelation is something that's
[28:01] Supernatural so if the supernatural God
[28:04] gives you a supernatural Revelation it's
[28:06] going to have a supernatural impact on
[28:08] your life you can't just stay here in
[28:11] the same condition and say well
[28:12] something's happening to me but I still
[28:14] struggle with this and struggle with
[28:16] that things are began going to begin to
[28:18] fall off but just like that team would
[28:20] that team would was changed when it got
[28:24] pitched within without and then Noah
[28:27] could take that and put it in the ark
[28:29] and it would become something it would
[28:31] become a part of God's plan and purpose
[28:35] you got to be identified
[28:37] your life has to be identified your life
[28:41] has to be Vindicated with this word and
[28:44] and what I'm getting here tonight is
[28:46] that's that picture of what John saw he
[28:49] saw a vision of of these things that I'm
[28:52] speaking of here tonight you got to be
[28:54] identified brother Adam said somewhere
[28:57] you must show your life shows tonight
[29:00] where you are identified
[29:05] oh you think about what a that's that
[29:07] seems almost
[29:09] like complicated or whatever whatever
[29:12] you'd say like a complex thing to think
[29:15] about
[29:16] but to think now that wherever you go
[29:18] that you can preach a message with your
[29:21] life I told Brother Wade uh on Sunday
[29:24] that the day before we went to I was
[29:26] picking my wife up at Ross and and uh
[29:29] you know we were just in the parking lot
[29:31] and this man came up to us in the
[29:33] parking lot after he saw my wife and my
[29:35] daughters walking around in their
[29:36] dresses and coming to the car and he
[29:38] started talking to me about how he was
[29:39] looking he saw he saw some people that
[29:43] were trying to live according to the
[29:45] scripture and he began to talk to us
[29:47] about how he was he he didn't he wasn't
[29:50] happy with where he was and he was
[29:52] looking for a church because there's
[29:53] people everywhere that are looking for
[29:55] something and you see you see now the
[29:58] example of the point I'm trying to make
[30:00] is that your life is a sermon and
[30:03] everywhere you go people can see if you
[30:05] believe what you say you believe because
[30:07] your life is on display and you actually
[30:10] oh you think about all these sermons
[30:12] that brother Brandon preached about your
[30:13] life did he preached the message
[30:15] influence that it Isaiah got to looking
[30:17] at the life of Josiah and and he was
[30:20] like and he failed his in his influence
[30:22] because his life didn't match up with
[30:24] what his testimony was and you think
[30:27] about the prayer the message the Paradox
[30:29] where brother Adam said that your life
[30:31] that God can change your life and that's
[30:33] a greater Miracle you think about all
[30:35] these things that God oh what a great
[30:37] thing it is to have a changed life that
[30:40] can preach a sermon up your life can
[30:42] preach a sermon greater than maybe any
[30:44] preacher the greatest sermon that any
[30:47] preacher could preach that when you go
[30:49] to Walmart and when you go to work and
[30:51] people see you people see you at work
[30:53] and you're not going out and drinking
[30:54] alcohol with everybody else that you're
[30:57] something different about you that
[30:59] you're you cause your life and your
[31:00] testimony is on display oh you see
[31:03] that's why when we come to church some
[31:05] people come to church because they're
[31:07] told we got to do it and some people
[31:09] come to church because of the good
[31:11] singing and some people come for a
[31:13] fellowship and some people just come to
[31:15] be a part of something but I'm coming to
[31:17] be changed I'm coming because I want to
[31:20] see more of Jesus Christ when we sing
[31:22] that word that song that song opened the
[31:25] Eyes of My Heart that's their purpose to
[31:27] come to church because Revelation is
[31:30] what is going to change us and
[31:32] Revelation is what's going to take us
[31:34] out of here Revelation is what's going
[31:36] to open up that door in heaven
[31:38] revelation of Jesus Christ the
[31:41] revelation of Jesus Christ to you means
[31:43] more than anything else the Revelation
[31:46] personally to you of who Jesus Christ is
[31:49] and it's got to be personally to you
[31:52] amen oh you see so many people look at
[31:54] the minister and they say well if I can
[31:55] just get the minister to Pat me on the
[31:57] back or give me that special word of
[31:59] acknowledgment but you see that's not
[32:00] what it is it's got the minister is to
[32:03] it's the minute what is what is the
[32:04] preaching of the Gospel to set an
[32:06] atmosphere in the church so that you
[32:08] begin to you begin to God can begin to
[32:11] draw you and you can begin to have a
[32:13] relationship with God not with the
[32:15] minister but between you and God
[32:21] now brother Brian said the same voice
[32:23] that said to John
[32:25] come up
[32:27] is the same voice
[32:28] that'll summons the church someday
[32:33] the same voice that said to John come up
[32:36] is the same voice that'll summons the
[32:39] church someday
[32:40] how are we going to take a rapture
[32:44] brother brother Bob I'm we're just gonna
[32:46] we're just gonna want to real bad
[32:48] oh we're just gonna wait till the date
[32:50] on the calendar shows up no it'll be a
[32:52] revelation that'll take you in the
[32:54] rapture
[32:57] same voice that John summoned John to
[33:00] come up
[33:01] that was written in first Thessalonians
[33:04] the Lord himself shall descend from
[33:06] heaven with a shout
[33:07] with the voice of the archangel and with
[33:10] the Trump of God
[33:11] and John said he that voice sounded like
[33:14] a trump
[33:15] that voice that's that it's that same
[33:17] voice that was in the prophet's message
[33:19] same voice that's speaking through the
[33:21] bride to get them ready the same voice
[33:24] the voice and it's still going to be the
[33:26] same voice that calls you up to reveal
[33:29] himself to you then we which are alive
[33:32] and remain shall be caught up together
[33:33] with them in the clouds
[33:35] to meet the Lord in the air
[33:37] and brother Bram said it's the same
[33:39] thing tonight when a clear sounding
[33:41] voice says sin and repent I'll give you
[33:44] eternal life oh think about that
[33:46] and now he's bringing it down here to
[33:48] right here in this congregation sitting
[33:51] here tonight on a Wednesday night and
[33:53] we're tired and the week has been hard
[33:56] but it's the same voice tonight when a
[34:00] clear sounding voice says repent and
[34:02] I'll give you eternal life
[34:04] repent every one of you and be baptized
[34:07] in the name of Jesus Christ brother
[34:09] Brown said and you shall receive the
[34:11] gift of the Holy Ghost that's the
[34:13] summons nothing uncertain about it
[34:18] what is it that voice that voice is
[34:20] calling us it's calling us higher now
[34:23] you remember we we all want to go higher
[34:25] and you sometimes we try to work things
[34:27] up and try to we try to go higher by
[34:29] pushing other people down try to go
[34:31] higher by elevating ourselves but
[34:33] remember and God the way up to go up now
[34:36] this it is so perplexing that the way up
[34:39] is not to not to put yourself up not to
[34:41] try to get yourself into a position but
[34:43] the way up is to always go down to where
[34:46] that to go down and Jesus typified that
[34:48] example throughout his life even to the
[34:51] place where you know they're sitting
[34:52] there eating eating the last supper and
[34:54] Jesus gets out the water and it gets
[34:56] down and starts washing his disciples
[34:58] feet because you got to go down so far
[35:01] until you're washing off that dirty
[35:03] manure from the street you're helping
[35:05] your brother helping your brother out in
[35:07] whatever way you can now there's true
[35:09] love to get down and then brother Brown
[35:11] even said he said you got to come to
[35:13] dust you got to get to a place that you
[35:16] know that you're nothing and don't never
[35:18] arise above it for as soon as you rise
[35:21] above it you ride eyes above God
[35:26] as soon as you arrived above dust what
[35:28] does that mean I I want something
[35:30] practical I can take home with me bro
[35:32] brother Bob when when a minister goes to
[35:35] another church and he comes in there
[35:36] with his chest pumped out and he's like
[35:38] if they don't ask me to preach then
[35:41] bless God they they don't like this and
[35:45] they don't like that oh you see we go in
[35:47] like dust
[35:48] duh when you rise above dust then you
[35:52] rise above God
[35:53] bless God so and so won't talk to me
[35:56] they can't talk to me that way but Jesus
[35:58] let them talk to him that way Jesus
[36:01] they're hanging on the cross and they
[36:02] were smiling him on the face and and
[36:04] spitting on him and everything and and
[36:06] he just let them I hope why can't we
[36:09] just let people talk to us he just let
[36:11] him if we're gonna be like Jesus
[36:15] but you see you can't just be like Jesus
[36:18] because you want to real bad it takes
[36:20] the word of God in your life you've got
[36:23] to be receptive to the word you've got
[36:25] to allow because what is the word doing
[36:27] that voice as it's spoken over your life
[36:30] is actually claiming your life and
[36:32] claiming you and changing your life is
[36:34] actually claiming your life and claiming
[36:37] you and changing you so you're like him
[36:41] so you walk like him and talk like him
[36:44] and act like him
[36:46] because his life is in you until the
[36:50] bride is him she is him because his life
[36:54] and his characteristics are all
[36:56] manifested in her
[36:59] and that's what John was representing
[37:02] John represented you
[37:05] John was love
[37:08] John come to a place there on that
[37:10] island where God come down and showed
[37:13] him the whole plan took him up and
[37:15] showed him the door opened in heaven
[37:17] showed him the The Throne of God with
[37:19] the Brazen altar in front of it and the
[37:22] 24 elders and the cherubims and this
[37:25] whole scene that was opening up at an
[37:28] emerald rainbow around about The Throne
[37:30] all these things and you see that was
[37:32] representing that was typing you
[37:35] sitting here tonight that was typing you
[37:37] that John John was love and you're going
[37:40] to have you're going to have Capstone
[37:42] love to get out of here
[37:45] enough love to turn the other cheek love
[37:48] enough to not rile back
[37:51] love enough not to roll back even when
[37:53] you've got a right
[37:55] Love Enough
[37:57] to think that you're nothing
[38:00] in First Corinthians Paul said If any
[38:02] man think that he knoweth anything he
[38:04] knoweth nothing yet is he ought to know
[38:06] but if any man what love God
[38:09] love God the same is known of him
[38:13] I I want people to know that I love God
[38:16] you know when you get in your mind
[38:18] sometimes that how much you know then
[38:20] before you know it you'll turn a corner
[38:22] and you'll find out how much you didn't
[38:23] know that's why Paul was saying that if
[38:26] any man think that he knoweth anything
[38:28] soon as you think you oh you think now
[38:30] I've got it down I understand that being
[38:32] born again I I now I can I can really
[38:35] preach and then you turn a corner and
[38:37] you find out that you got to add to your
[38:39] faith virtue and now you've got all that
[38:41] figured out oh you got it figured out
[38:43] and and there's always more around the
[38:46] corner and you think that you know it
[38:47] all and then you just turn around the
[38:49] corner and there's somebody else that
[38:51] maybe knows a little bit more about this
[38:53] particular thing than you do
[38:56] that's why we always need to
[38:59] don't never rise above the Dust
[39:02] and even Jesus God God made himself oh
[39:06] you think about that Jesus come down and
[39:07] made himself of no reputation in
[39:10] Philippians chapter 3 he said uh he said
[39:13] let nothing be done through Strife or
[39:16] vainglory but in lowliness of mine Let
[39:19] each esteem other better than themselves
[39:22] look not every man on his own things but
[39:24] every man also on the things of others
[39:27] unless this mind be in you which was
[39:29] also in Christ Jesus
[39:31] who being in the form of God thought it
[39:34] not robbery to be equal with God
[39:36] but made himself of no reputation
[39:40] and took upon him the form of a serpent
[39:43] it was made in the likeness of man
[39:46] now what does that mean to take on no
[39:48] reputation
[39:49] the man that made brother Brown said the
[39:51] man that made a false leg
[39:55] got a reputation for doing it
[39:57] oh you think about that now
[39:59] but the man that made a real leg
[40:02] when he was here didn't get no
[40:03] reputation
[40:05] the man that made the real teeth he
[40:07] didn't get it it didn't take his self no
[40:09] reputation but the man that made false
[40:11] teeth got a reputation
[40:14] the man that made an artificial eye made
[40:16] himself a name by doing it but the man
[40:19] that made the real eye took all himself
[40:22] no reputation
[40:24] but he was Emmanuel
[40:26] now if if God himself manifested in
[40:29] flesh could array himself like that the
[40:32] god that made a leg and an eye and an
[40:35] arm and all those things could take
[40:36] himself take no reputation then what
[40:39] about you and I
[40:43] it's gonna the Revelation a revelation
[40:46] is going to take us out of here is going
[40:48] to come to a bunch of nobodies
[40:50] I think that's the point that I'm trying
[40:51] to make somebody that's willing to just
[40:53] allow themselves to be run over somebody
[40:56] is willing to allow themselves to be
[40:59] used and abused
[41:01] brother said look at who John the
[41:02] Baptist was some kind of odd little
[41:04] fella a Woodsman out in the woods a
[41:06] nobody but it was revealed to him
[41:08] look at the little Virgin Mary look at
[41:10] everybody in the Bible who amounted to
[41:12] nothing a man Elijah to come out of the
[41:14] Wilderness nobody knew nothing about him
[41:16] a little nobody and he said rain ain't
[41:18] going to fall till I could call the rain
[41:21] won't fall until I call for it look at
[41:23] look at Moses who he thought he tried to
[41:25] be somebody but then he God took him out
[41:27] on the desert so he could prove to him
[41:29] what he really was that he wasn't nobody
[41:31] he wasn't a nobody and he needed God to
[41:35] move on the scene for him look at
[41:37] Abraham who a man out in the Fertile
[41:39] Crescent and God just turned him around
[41:41] one day and said get out here get out
[41:43] here in this Promised Land a man that
[41:45] God God showed him who he really was
[41:48] they heard the call and it was revealed
[41:50] to him revealed to a bunch of nobodies a
[41:53] little nobody on the Isle of Patmos that
[41:55] they got so frustrated with that they
[41:57] couldn't Bowl him and all that they said
[41:58] well I don't know what to do with him so
[42:00] we'll just put you out here brother said
[42:02] he was alone alone on the Isle of patma
[42:05] a nobody a nobody that gets to a place
[42:08] where they're no they're down in the
[42:10] dust that's the kind of person that God
[42:12] can work with
[42:13] I want to say this tonight that it's the
[42:17] kind of person that God can work with
[42:18] it's like brother Brown said to make
[42:19] little man with his lunch box going to
[42:21] work
[42:23] you don't have to work nothing up and
[42:25] try to be something special the little
[42:27] sister hanging her clothes out to dry on
[42:29] a clothesline and you see these aren't
[42:32] just stories to see like just rhetoric
[42:34] to try to get everybody worked up and
[42:36] cry a little bit but it's real it's real
[42:39] this is something real that the
[42:41] Revelation to get out of here is going
[42:43] to be revealed to Humble Little People
[42:46] humble people like Hattie Wright that
[42:48] didn't have no money and she was sitting
[42:50] up there and the tractor had fallen on
[42:52] her husband but yet God came by and paid
[42:55] her a visit
[42:57] that's the kind of people aren't you
[42:58] glad that that's the kind of people that
[43:00] the word is revealed to a little humble
[43:02] group of people not something special in
[43:05] the way that the world calls special but
[43:07] God has made you a special group of
[43:10] people a special class of people why
[43:12] because you were willing to humble
[43:14] yourself to the word of God and submit
[43:17] yourself to his authority and do like do
[43:20] like Ruth and lay at the feet of your
[43:22] Redeemer and say cover me over I'm not
[43:25] worth nothing without you but if you'll
[43:28] cover me over I know that you'll
[43:30] accomplish the purpose
[43:32] John heard a voice calling him up come
[43:35] up hither and that voice is yet calling
[43:39] today
[43:41] you know in John chapter 10 Jesus said
[43:43] to him the porter openness and the sheep
[43:45] hear his voice and he calleth his own
[43:47] Sheep by name
[43:48] and leadeth him out and when he puteth
[43:50] forth his own sheep he goeth before them
[43:52] and the Sheep follow him for they know
[43:54] his voice oh I I I I I feel like I I
[43:59] just can't reiterating that I'm enough a
[44:01] born-again Believer ever ever believer
[44:03] should know should be able to recognize
[44:05] the voice of God when you hear when you
[44:08] hear a good sermon preached over the
[44:09] pulpit you should something something
[44:11] begins to stir I recognize that voice
[44:13] that's that's my God calling me when
[44:17] you're talking to a believer in the
[44:18] parking lot something will begin to stir
[44:20] up within you is faith building up to
[44:23] know that that's that's my God talking
[44:25] to me that's the voice that I've heard
[44:28] since the very beginning you know a man
[44:31] can't call you a man can't draw you a
[44:34] man can't give you this invitation
[44:36] brother Brandon would say but that's why
[44:38] we can't force you to believe but what I
[44:41] can do I can't force you to be a
[44:43] Christian I can't force you to come to
[44:45] church I can't force you to come to the
[44:48] Bible say dirty I can't force you to
[44:49] gather around but what I can do I can
[44:52] speak a word of encouragement to you I
[44:55] can speak what's written here in the
[44:57] Bible and set an atmosphere in the
[44:59] church and create an environment where
[45:02] you can respond to God and what God God
[45:06] can do what no man could ever do you see
[45:09] Jesus said no man could come to me
[45:12] except the Father which I sent me
[45:14] drawing and I'll raise him up at the
[45:16] last that no man can come to me except
[45:18] the father drawn but when God calls you
[45:22] oh if God is calling at your heart
[45:26] tonight don't don't put don't let
[45:29] another day go by until you respond
[45:32] that is the greatest gift on the face of
[45:34] the earth when God draws a man when God
[45:37] speaks to your heart and begins to
[45:39] begins to reveal himself to you begins
[45:42] to what you to say I I want to speak to
[45:44] your heart now
[45:47] oh to think now
[45:50] that your life
[45:52] now see you've got to have a Vindicated
[45:54] life
[45:55] that your life can create an atmosphere
[45:58] that your words can create an atmosphere
[46:02] that your words and your life can create
[46:05] an atmosphere where somebody wants to be
[46:06] a Christian
[46:08] create an atmosphere where somebody
[46:11] wants to give their heart to the Lord
[46:16] that's the kind of Christian I want to
[46:17] be
[46:18] there I want to stir you up tonight to
[46:20] want to be that kind of Christian
[46:23] every born-again believer
[46:26] has the power
[46:28] to create an atmosphere
[46:31] that around you everywhere you go
[46:33] because a born-again Believer is a
[46:35] Creator you have the ability to create
[46:38] an atmosphere what kind of an atmosphere
[46:41] an atmosphere where other people want to
[46:45] be like Jesus
[46:51] let's I I want to encourage you tonight
[46:53] to let's let's stir ourselves up to
[46:55] examine ourselves
[46:56] and look at our life and say am I that
[46:59] kind of a person
[47:01] because what I'm talking about tonight
[47:02] is you've got to be that kind of a
[47:05] person if you want to step over without
[47:07] dying step over into eternity and take a
[47:11] Rapture to go straight through that door
[47:13] that John said because why why brother
[47:16] Bob because to be that kind of a
[47:18] Believer to be that kind of person to go
[47:21] to the Rapture without taste and death
[47:23] you've got to be like Jesus
[47:27] you got to be just like Jesus
[47:30] my brother Adam said do you now and do
[47:32] you now believe he said now let me tell
[47:34] you something
[47:35] each man that's born again with the
[47:37] spirit of God in him is a miniature
[47:39] creator
[47:40] now that might shake you a little but
[47:42] that's the truth we're in the image of
[47:44] God God is a Creator that's the reason
[47:46] that you can believe that God could heal
[47:48] a person because God is in you and God
[47:51] made this world he just spoke it and his
[47:55] word become material the very ground
[47:58] that you're sitting on is the word of
[47:59] God made manifest if he didn't where
[48:01] where did he get it well see he just
[48:03] spoke it and it turned into existence he
[48:06] believed in his own word
[48:09] and if a man's born to the spirit of God
[48:12] he's an offspring of God and that part
[48:15] of God is in him and he believes every
[48:19] word that God says will materialize
[48:22] see
[48:24] so that makes him part of God
[48:27] the Holy Spirit and the man makes him a
[48:29] part of God
[48:31] and now now here's the the Clincher
[48:34] did you ever see people nice people but
[48:38] you just couldn't hardly stand to be
[48:40] around sure you have you don't have
[48:42] nothing against them but you can't stand
[48:45] to be around them
[48:50] usually the reason you can't stand to
[48:52] read around somebody is because they're
[48:53] pulling you down and they're saying you
[48:55] I don't want to hear negative stuff all
[48:57] the time and they're they're trying to
[48:58] lift themselves up by saying something
[49:00] hurtful poking and prodding and always
[49:02] picking and
[49:04] wonderful people surely but you don't
[49:07] want to be around them
[49:08] and then then brother Brown will say
[49:10] then you've seen some person that saw
[49:12] maybe a little old scrawny fella that's
[49:15] what I'm talking about
[49:16] or a little old woman bent over a wash
[49:19] tub
[49:20] but you just love to be around that
[49:23] person
[49:24] you just love them somehow what what are
[49:27] you talking about brother bro I'm
[49:28] talking about little nobodies
[49:30] somebody bent over a wash tub
[49:33] it's the atmosphere that they've got
[49:35] around it
[49:37] the way they live
[49:39] they create an atmosphere that you like
[49:42] to be into
[49:43] that's lovely people to be with I
[49:48] ought to think that the words that you
[49:50] say can create an atmosphere that your
[49:52] life creates an atmosphere
[49:54] that preaching creates an atmosphere oh
[49:58] surely you can recognize here that
[49:59] sitting in this in this place that
[50:01] there's a different atmosphere that
[50:03] there is outside in the world there's an
[50:05] atmosphere when you sit under the the
[50:07] the the anointing of the preaching of
[50:09] the Gospel that begins to cause you to
[50:12] think that all things are possible well
[50:14] maybe when you were driving in on the
[50:15] way to church tonight you were thinking
[50:17] that you've been having a rough week and
[50:19] then you come into church and you begin
[50:21] to think you start thinking about where
[50:23] you are in your life and that you've
[50:25] heard that voice all this time that same
[50:27] voice has been calling you and it begins
[50:30] to anoint your faith begins to lift you
[50:32] up why because God wants you to come up
[50:34] higher he's calling you higher he's
[50:37] calling you higher just like he called
[50:38] John up it's the preaching the words the
[50:42] life the life of the Gospel that you see
[50:45] on display here at the church sets an
[50:48] atmosphere in your it sets to the
[50:50] atmosphere in the building an atmosphere
[50:52] to draw you up higher
[50:56] that's what the preaching of the Gospel
[50:57] is for to create an atmosphere to draw
[51:00] you up higher to draw you a pyre which
[51:03] is why you'll never go higher than what
[51:05] is preached it's got to be high to draw
[51:08] you up it's got to be deep to draw you
[51:11] up why because because we're not here
[51:13] just to be born again we're not here
[51:16] just to sit around at the bottom but
[51:17] we've been called to be like John to be
[51:20] an eagle to fly up into the heavenlies
[51:23] so the preaching of the Gospel in this
[51:25] day has got to be high
[51:31] that there's so many different Avenues I
[51:33] could go down it's like all of a sudden
[51:35] I'm thinking of different things that
[51:37] could be said but I gotta
[51:40] said he's the one that showed John the
[51:43] mystery of them seven golden
[51:44] candlesticks holding the Seven Stars the
[51:48] white wigs feet like brass eyes like
[51:50] fire
[51:51] all the symbols he's the one that gave
[51:54] the gospel he's the one that gave the
[51:56] message
[51:57] he's the one that has been speaking
[51:59] through the seven churches he's the one
[52:01] that spoke through the seven certain
[52:03] Messengers
[52:04] is his voice
[52:06] and it's the same one we say that's been
[52:09] speaking to you the whole time of your
[52:12] Christian Journey
[52:13] what are you talking about brother Bob
[52:15] I'm talking about that one day you knew
[52:17] that it was time to turn around
[52:20] damn it just like Abraham
[52:23] one day you knew that the message was
[52:26] true
[52:27] not because somebody told you but
[52:29] because you heard the voice of God
[52:32] one day you will know that it's time to
[52:36] go up
[52:37] not because somebody preached a real
[52:39] good sermon that kind of got everybody
[52:41] you know
[52:42] thinking along a good theological line
[52:44] but one day you'll know that it's time
[52:47] to go up because you'll hear the voice
[52:49] of God what is it the voice of
[52:52] Revelation
[52:54] a revelation that your Redemption is
[52:56] complete
[52:58] so in Revelation chapter 4 verse two to
[53:00] three it says immediately I was in the
[53:03] spirit and behold a throne was set in
[53:05] heaven and one said on the throne and he
[53:08] that set was to look upon like a Jasper
[53:10] and a sword and stone there was a
[53:12] rainbow round about the throne in sight
[53:15] like unto an emerald
[53:17] now brother Ryan will say every word's
[53:19] got a meaning
[53:20] ever he he said every person every
[53:23] person in this building tonight based
[53:25] depending on what month you were born in
[53:27] has a birthstone
[53:30] and every time that a patriarch was born
[53:32] they had a birthstone
[53:35] now now you think about that I think
[53:37] let's let's really meditate on this
[53:39] tonight
[53:40] that the first of those birthstones was
[53:43] Reuben and the last of those birthstones
[53:46] was Benjamin in other words he's
[53:48] speaking that God is the first and the
[53:51] last first and last of what that he
[53:53] started this church ages he's finished
[53:55] him he started your Revelation and he's
[53:57] going to finish it he's going to bring
[53:59] you to an end he started the whole thing
[54:01] and he's going to finish it he said the
[54:03] first was Reuben the last was Benjamin
[54:05] the birthstone of Reuben was Jasper the
[54:09] birthstone of Benjamin was Sergeant he
[54:11] was to look upon as Reuben and Benjamin
[54:13] the first and the last he that was which
[54:16] is and shall come he was Alpha and the
[54:19] Greek alphabet Omega and the Greek
[54:21] alphabet he was the first the last he
[54:23] was from Benjamin to Reuben from Reuben
[54:26] to Benjamin what is it speaking of that
[54:28] he's the author of your faith and he's
[54:31] your finisher he's it's the same voice
[54:34] the whole time and the one that started
[54:36] the work in you is able to finish it
[54:37] he's the one from Reuben to Benjamin
[54:40] Jasper to Sardis what is it it's a
[54:43] journey it's a process that God has been
[54:45] dealing with you as he takes you on a
[54:47] attorney just like he took Abraham on
[54:49] and Ruth on and estheron at every all
[54:53] these stories in the Bible David and
[54:56] Abraham and everyone at Moses every one
[54:58] of them you can go back to and see that
[55:00] they started off somewhere and God took
[55:03] them to a place of of completion in
[55:05] their life
[55:06] there's a start of something and there's
[55:09] an end of something
[55:10] brother Brown said he was the beginning
[55:12] of time he's the ending of time he was
[55:15] the first of the Patriarchs he's the
[55:18] last of the Patriarchs he was the spirit
[55:20] that was in the Church of Ephesus he was
[55:22] the spirit in the Church of laodicea he
[55:25] is the first and the last A to Z first
[55:29] last he that was and shall come rude and
[55:32] offspring of David the Morning Star the
[55:34] lily of the valley the rose and shared
[55:37] he's the first and the last now that's
[55:39] why that's why when you get up when you
[55:42] begin as the seals begin to open up the
[55:43] seventh seal is what the end the end of
[55:46] all things so as the seals begin to open
[55:49] up what's the seals reveal and they'll
[55:51] see a seals of revealing a journey and
[55:54] the seventh seal is the end that's why
[55:56] brother Brian would say it's the seventh
[55:57] seal is the end it's the end of the
[56:00] struggling world it's the end of
[56:02] struggling nature it's the end of the
[56:04] church age it's the end of the Seven
[56:07] Seals it's the end of the trumpets it's
[56:10] the the end of the vows and even ends
[56:13] the ushering end of the Millennium and
[56:15] that's what we're looking at here when
[56:17] we look at these two stones The Jasper
[56:19] and The Sword and the stone it's talking
[56:21] about a journey
[56:22] now brother would say you take you take
[56:25] these birthstones as a mother as the
[56:27] mothers cried out that they were
[56:28] actually speaking where these children
[56:30] of Israel be placed in the Homeland and
[56:33] you take those stones that typified each
[56:35] of those children the children of Israel
[56:37] and you and you put them put them in
[56:40] that urum
[56:43] let's think about this now because what
[56:45] what are we talking about tonight I'm
[56:47] talking about that your life has to be
[56:49] Vindicated
[56:50] your life has to be proven scripturally
[56:53] that matches up with the Bible
[56:55] that's the kind of person that's going
[56:57] to take a body change
[56:59] that's why you know as we're studying
[57:01] these things out these sermons that that
[57:03] brother Brown preached these little
[57:05] stories that are just kind of woven in
[57:07] here are for a purpose to build up our
[57:09] faith to give us a revelation of
[57:12] something that maybe was previously
[57:13] hidden so brother Brown he would say now
[57:16] I'm just going to this is kind of a long
[57:17] reading but now now think about taking
[57:19] those stones and putting them into the
[57:21] breastplate of the high priest
[57:24] and when a prophet comes and speaks
[57:27] before those stones that are in that
[57:28] breastplate
[57:30] a light is going to shine to show
[57:32] whether or not the prophet's word is
[57:35] true
[57:36] and he said well then mothers he said
[57:38] let me show you a Divine word friend so
[57:40] that your faith will be built certain in
[57:42] the word of God every time them Hebrew
[57:45] mothers when they were in labor given
[57:46] labor pains to be born these children
[57:48] the very words that she uttered in her
[57:50] birth give the man the baby that was
[57:52] born of her his name and positionally
[57:54] placed him in Palestine where he'll be
[57:57] at the coming of the Lord
[57:59] the labor pains in this mother
[58:01] like Ephraim means by the Sea and
[58:04] Ephraim was given his lot by the sea
[58:06] and say Judah meant I don't know what
[58:08] the word means but I could pick it out
[58:10] now see that's where I don't have time
[58:11] these short things to pick those things
[58:13] up but then go back and Judah whatever
[58:15] Judah means men in his position placed
[58:17] among the children of Israel each one of
[58:19] those children when they were born they
[58:21] had a birthstone
[58:23] and when Aaron the high priest over each
[58:25] one of those children had a breastplate
[58:27] on him his dress that's what I want to
[58:30] hold off just a little longer to get
[58:31] into this sixth verse because that
[58:33] brings in every symbol of the Old
[58:35] Testament right into there all the
[58:38] furniture and everything in the Old
[58:39] Testament was a pattern of that was seen
[58:41] in heaven patterned back to the human
[58:44] being and here's Aaron's breastplate he
[58:48] was a high priest notice the birthstone
[58:51] of each tribe was represented in there
[58:53] one a birthstone put his stone in there
[58:55] the tribe of Ephraim the tribe of
[58:57] Manasseh the tribe of GAD The Tribe of
[59:00] Benjamin all was represented in in here
[59:02] and that's taught everybody was
[59:04] represented in that breastplate
[59:07] everybody from their birth
[59:09] representing their birth was put in that
[59:11] breastplate
[59:13] then they take those birthstones and
[59:15] pretty gems and hang it on the post like
[59:17] this and if a prophet prophesied
[59:21] and it's a sound right or not they taken
[59:24] him down to this urum thumb and let him
[59:27] tell his prophecy if there's a sacred
[59:30] light come on there and begin to flash
[59:32] these Stones together it was God
[59:35] speaking back
[59:36] it was for the whole tribe all of them
[59:39] every tribe
[59:41] now I I want to maybe just cause you to
[59:44] think for a moment if you could take a
[59:46] Lively Stone and put them where they're
[59:48] supposed to be
[59:49] and then let a prophet speak in front of
[59:51] him the light would flash back to
[59:53] vindicate that that prophet's message
[59:55] was true then that would mean if you
[59:58] were Lively stones and that would mean
[59:59] that you actually are the proof that the
[1:00:02] prophet's message is true when the
[1:00:04] prophet speaks over your life and the
[1:00:06] light of the Gospel the light of what
[1:00:08] that same light that was in that Pillar
[1:00:10] of Fire over him is anointing the church
[1:00:13] today and I'm proven that's what brother
[1:00:14] Randall was bringing out when he
[1:00:16] preached to Revelation chapter 4 part 2
[1:00:18] that that same Pillar of Fire is now in
[1:00:21] you the same Pillar of Fire that most
[1:00:23] churches have hanging on the wall in
[1:00:25] their congregation so it can be referred
[1:00:27] to that same Pillar of Fire is in you in
[1:00:31] your life and when the prophet speaks
[1:00:34] the light flashes across your life to
[1:00:37] show that his word was true that means
[1:00:40] your life is the very Vindication that
[1:00:42] this word is true the word of God has
[1:00:45] positionally placed you in your
[1:00:47] inheritance and you are the proof is
[1:00:49] true because the word of God has claimed
[1:00:53] your life when the prophet prophesied
[1:00:55] the light is shown in your life to prove
[1:00:58] that it was correct oh you see what is
[1:01:01] the proof what is the proof of the
[1:01:02] pudding what is the proof of what tree
[1:01:05] it is what is the proof the proof is in
[1:01:07] the life when the life comes up out of
[1:01:10] that tree and begins to Bear forth fruit
[1:01:12] you can look and say there's an orange
[1:01:14] hanging off that tree and I know that
[1:01:17] that's an orange tree because I can see
[1:01:19] the life
[1:01:20] that's what Jesus said in Matthew
[1:01:22] chapter 7 he said every tree that
[1:01:25] breakth forth not good fruit is hewned
[1:01:27] down and cast Into the Fire wherefore by
[1:01:30] their fruits ye shall know them how are
[1:01:33] you going to know them how are you going
[1:01:34] to know a real G I'm talking about this
[1:01:37] kind of a real genuine Christian by
[1:01:40] their fruits and what did Brothers say
[1:01:42] your fruit was your Doctrine and your
[1:01:44] Doctrine planted in the sea of a of a
[1:01:47] heart that's willing to receive it well
[1:01:49] it'll Bubble Up and produce the thing
[1:01:52] that was planted in the heart of your
[1:01:53] ground
[1:01:54] the same thing that was planted is
[1:01:57] what'll produce what are you produce and
[1:02:00] you're producing the word that you've
[1:02:02] held because the word is what will
[1:02:05] change your character and the character
[1:02:07] that's on display is what was sown in
[1:02:10] your heart
[1:02:12] hey hey I don't know how that doesn't
[1:02:15] stir anybody up
[1:02:20] and a paradox brother Ryan said you
[1:02:22] thinking you have
[1:02:24] and having it it's two different things
[1:02:27] you might be able to try to say you have
[1:02:29] and you might be able to show some
[1:02:30] evidence of some emotion but unless your
[1:02:33] life
[1:02:34] is vindicating what you're professing to
[1:02:37] have
[1:02:37] you still haven't got it
[1:02:42] he said no matter how many emotions how
[1:02:44] much you jump run Sensations speaking in
[1:02:46] tongues or shouting or whatever you
[1:02:48] might lay it upon which is all right I
[1:02:51] believe in all that too
[1:02:53] but unless your life copes with your
[1:02:57] testimony
[1:02:58] then you haven't got it
[1:03:00] because the fruit of the spirit
[1:03:02] vindicates what you are just like the
[1:03:05] fruit of any tree tells what it is
[1:03:09] now now the fruit the fruit of this kind
[1:03:11] of Christian
[1:03:13] somebody that's yielded themselves to
[1:03:15] the place where they come up to love and
[1:03:17] acting just like Jesus what's going to
[1:03:19] be on display the fruits of the spirit
[1:03:22] they're going to love they're going to
[1:03:24] have joy and speakable they're going to
[1:03:26] have all these fruits on display able to
[1:03:28] bear with one another that's the kind of
[1:03:30] Christian that I think John was was that
[1:03:33] this story is speaking of here in
[1:03:35] Revelation chapter four somebody that
[1:03:38] comes to a place
[1:03:39] comes to a place where you can take a
[1:03:41] body change you're going to be just like
[1:03:45] Jesus
[1:03:46] you got to have the life on display
[1:03:49] you got to have the token life on
[1:03:52] display the token is the blood and
[1:03:54] what's in the blood is the life
[1:03:57] that's why it says there was a rainbow
[1:03:59] round about the throne in sight like
[1:04:01] unto an eminent
[1:04:03] oh you think about this picture that
[1:04:05] John saw there was a rainbow round about
[1:04:08] The Throne complete not like a half
[1:04:10] rainbow but all the way around and it
[1:04:12] wasn't like a seven colored rainbow it
[1:04:14] was one color and he said it was like an
[1:04:17] emerald in other words it was green a
[1:04:21] green rainbow
[1:04:23] a greenish he said this greenish what
[1:04:26] does green represent life green is the
[1:04:30] Evergreen always stays green is life why
[1:04:36] because this kind of a Christian is
[1:04:39] going to be a fountain of everlasting
[1:04:41] life this kind of a Christian is going
[1:04:43] to have an Artesian well bubbling up
[1:04:45] within them some this kind of Christian
[1:04:48] is going to take a body change you're
[1:04:49] going to be able to see that life on
[1:04:51] this place so much that it they'll
[1:04:53] they'll create an atmosphere everywhere
[1:04:55] they go you'll be able to look at them
[1:04:56] and say that person right there has got
[1:04:58] all these virtues in them this person
[1:05:00] has got patience and Temperance and they
[1:05:02] know what they're talking about when I
[1:05:04] talk to them and they're encouraging
[1:05:05] when I when I sit around with them
[1:05:07] they're not pushing me down and trying
[1:05:09] to build themselves up by pushing me
[1:05:10] down and picking on everybody else and
[1:05:12] fighting a weak spot like a chicken in
[1:05:14] the barnyard does and poking at it but
[1:05:16] they're trying to build up one another
[1:05:17] Like an Eagle because that's what an
[1:05:19] eagle does an eagle will find another
[1:05:21] eagle with crushed on their eyes and
[1:05:23] then try to build them up and encourage
[1:05:25] them that's the kind of love that's got
[1:05:28] to be on display
[1:05:29] oh
[1:05:32] the picture of that life
[1:05:34] a picture of that life is a Vindication
[1:05:37] of this message that's the proof that
[1:05:40] this message is true
[1:05:42] and brother Brown said now that you
[1:05:43] might not you might know that the color
[1:05:45] of the light that's where the Laurel and
[1:05:47] the Lord's light that follows the Lord
[1:05:48] and it's as the Lord is Amber yellowish
[1:05:51] green that's the same color of the light
[1:05:54] that's with us today
[1:05:56] as the scientist has took its picture
[1:05:59] yellowish green Amber oh see we we
[1:06:02] always for years people they look at
[1:06:04] that picture on their wall and they say
[1:06:06] that was back there with brother Branham
[1:06:07] he had this special anointing and all
[1:06:10] these which which of course we know that
[1:06:11] he did but the point that I'm trying to
[1:06:14] make is that same God that was with him
[1:06:17] typified shown visibly in that with that
[1:06:19] same with that light that same God is
[1:06:23] here with you tonight it's here with us
[1:06:25] creating this atmosphere in this
[1:06:28] building right now surely surely you can
[1:06:31] recognize that God is with us here
[1:06:34] surely you can recognize surely if
[1:06:37] you're sensitive to the movement of the
[1:06:38] Holy Spirit you can recognize his
[1:06:40] presence in that place at this place why
[1:06:43] because we know that same Pillar of Fire
[1:06:46] is with us now he said I want you to
[1:06:49] remember that God still exists in the
[1:06:53] same colors from the loins upward fire
[1:06:56] Amber Kohler shot with a movie camera or
[1:06:58] with a color camera Amber from the loins
[1:07:01] up from the loins down and all around
[1:07:03] many colors like us in the rainbow in
[1:07:05] the sky after a rain Jesus Christ the
[1:07:08] same yesterday today and forever the
[1:07:12] Holy Spirit still in his power still in
[1:07:15] his church in this last day oh oh can't
[1:07:17] you see that tonight church that he's
[1:07:19] still in the same power because he's
[1:07:21] still the same yesterday today and
[1:07:24] forever somebody asked brother Brown and
[1:07:26] one of the questions that answers
[1:07:27] sermons in 1964 he said uh he said I
[1:07:30] guess he said what was the other
[1:07:31] question I get so wound up when these
[1:07:33] forget what these things were one of
[1:07:34] them was was I the son of man and here
[1:07:37] it is I believe the son of man or was
[1:07:38] the pillar of fire the son of man he
[1:07:40] said no the pillar of fire is the
[1:07:43] anointing amen he said now that Pillar
[1:07:45] of Fire is the logos that went out of
[1:07:47] God the logos which is actually the
[1:07:50] attribute of the fullness of God when
[1:07:52] God becoming to a form to where it could
[1:07:54] be seen it was the anointing of the
[1:07:57] great spirit that went forth It's
[1:07:59] condescending coming down it's coming
[1:08:02] down coming down to where to rest in you
[1:08:05] in your heart that's the picture that
[1:08:08] John saw is that God is dwelling in you
[1:08:10] that that right that Emerald rainbow all
[1:08:13] around that Throne is showing that God
[1:08:15] that life is in you he said and who do
[1:08:18] you say this is he said Lord we know
[1:08:21] it's you it's Jesus Christ and the
[1:08:23] person of the Holy Ghost he is the Holy
[1:08:26] Ghost I come from God I go to God and we
[1:08:29] see the great Pillar of Fire Among Us
[1:08:30] Lord the same as they did in the first
[1:08:34] part of the Bible with Moses we've seen
[1:08:37] it in the middle of the Bible when Paul
[1:08:38] was on his road to Damascus we see it
[1:08:41] now here we see it at the end time again
[1:08:45] it's the same Lord Jesus made flesh and
[1:08:49] his people anointing his word for the
[1:08:53] bride
[1:08:54] oh to think about that same life that
[1:08:57] was with brother Branham was with you
[1:08:59] now that's something to meditate on when
[1:09:01] you lay behind beside your bed tonight
[1:09:03] and you say your evening prayers that's
[1:09:06] something to meditate on when you open
[1:09:07] up your Bible tomorrow morning and you
[1:09:09] begin to pour through the scriptures to
[1:09:11] think that that same Pillar of Fire is
[1:09:14] with you
[1:09:15] and that same Pillar of Fire
[1:09:18] is changing you what is it life in you
[1:09:21] brother Bob said in the message of Grace
[1:09:23] he said now Jesus Christ dwells in the
[1:09:26] people one day Christ was in a pillar of
[1:09:29] fire that one you see taken and we
[1:09:32] believe it to be Jehovah God that's what
[1:09:34] the angel was trying to get to us now he
[1:09:37] was in the fatherhood then he was the
[1:09:39] father of Israel and Nation then he came
[1:09:41] and dwelt among his people as Christ the
[1:09:43] son is that right Christ was the son of
[1:09:45] God now he's Christ the Holy Spirit
[1:09:48] which is the anointing Christ means the
[1:09:52] anointed and the anointed one upon the
[1:09:55] people Christ with us the holy spirit is
[1:09:58] Christ with us in us and he asked that
[1:10:01] question
[1:10:02] you believe that
[1:10:04] if that Holy same Holy Ghost is with us
[1:10:07] that means that that same life is in you
[1:10:10] that that same life is in the church and
[1:10:14] the whole Christian story is about life
[1:10:16] from the time that Abel offered that
[1:10:19] sacrifice because he knew it was life he
[1:10:21] knew it was blood to the time that
[1:10:23] Christ offered his sacrifice for us so
[1:10:25] that his life could be put in us to now
[1:10:28] where that same life is in you and the
[1:10:30] fullness the fullness of the God had
[1:10:33] bodily back in his bride again revealing
[1:10:35] Christ in his fullness that God would be
[1:10:38] manifested with the same character the
[1:10:41] same attributes
[1:10:42] the same response to the world
[1:10:46] and you know that life will be an
[1:10:49] attraction
[1:10:50] the life is an attraction what is the
[1:10:53] life the life becomes a voice that is
[1:10:57] thundering out the life becomes the
[1:11:00] greatest testimony that's ever been
[1:11:02] lived the greatest testimony is a life
[1:11:05] that is lived by the word
[1:11:07] what kind of life you talking about I'm
[1:11:08] talking about that life like brother
[1:11:10] Chris long was preaching about that
[1:11:12] where you become a burning bush where
[1:11:14] when people when people see the life
[1:11:16] that you live they want to turn aside to
[1:11:19] ask you some questions about what you
[1:11:20] believe oh that's that's that's what we
[1:11:24] all got to attain to we've all got to
[1:11:26] put Christ on display we're we're
[1:11:29] demonstrating the same love and the same
[1:11:31] joy and the same peace and
[1:11:34] long-suffering now there's how you get
[1:11:36] the Saints to come to church
[1:11:39] there's how you get people to come to
[1:11:41] Fellowship
[1:11:42] is let there be an attraction
[1:11:44] there's how you get people together
[1:11:46] around there's an attraction there's an
[1:11:48] attraction that'll draw the predecinated
[1:11:50] and then you see you see there's a there
[1:11:52] was an attraction there's a third pool
[1:11:54] attraction to draw those rainbow trout
[1:11:57] fish you can't oh well you fisherman you
[1:11:59] know that when you go fishing you can't
[1:12:00] get you can't like Rush a bunch of fish
[1:12:03] to get up in your boat
[1:12:04] you gotta catch them you got to put some
[1:12:07] bait on the hook and the bait on the
[1:12:09] hook is the life they'll see your life
[1:12:12] and they'll want to know more and they
[1:12:14] bite the hook and the hook is the word
[1:12:17] and the word grabs them so let them see
