========================================

got it all right oh that's ugly anyway okay I want to uh answer a question that um just a freed a half of the last week we kind of got on circumcision and things like that and I'm gonna let brother Branham answer it because I got a quote pulled up here and you don't mind me reading the question okay they're good questions there's the fact that Abram Abraham had children by three different women have a spiritual meaning type Etc yes because Abram had one child Abraham had a promise Son by Sarah and then he had children by another woman that means that the all all nations can come in and be covered under the Covenant ishmael's kids are covered under a covenant we preached that yeah okay they have a covenant they have a promise they have a way to get back I mean you know their Wild Child they're over there fighting but you know what God give them a problem okay because they come through Abram under a permissive promise everything with Abram was permissive everything with Abraham after the change was the perfect will of God because that was the promised child Isaac there was only one child promised to Abram Abraham any of them that was one that was Isaac okay and through Isaac was comes all this at work that we're we're talking about hearing Psalms and all that so so it's very important and then the ones he had later means that all the rest of them can come in it didn't work last week and I don't see it working this week either we don't have Bob here we got a brother Louise with us maybe he can take care of all this junk I have no audio huh no you don't know anything about that yet you're welcome I just don't want to touch it yet I will it's recording and it's recording up here so let's not worry about that all right let's get started because I want to read this this Frida acid what the circumcision what's the spiritual type of circumvision now all of you know what that is is that correct we're all adults and here we know that the males born with excess foreskin on his private parts and it's just there and God gave Israel a promise I mean Abraham I promise hang on a minute I'm fine whoa here in just a second there we go here's your tie the Holy Ghost is circumcision what circumcision do cuts off Surplus flesh all the things of the world it circumcises you away from the things of the world the love of the world the love of the flesh the pride of life it just circumcises you from that you have nothing to do with it it does it itself now this is the spiritual application okay back in the Old Testament under the bulls and goats what we were just talking about the law the law couldn't do away with sin all right so it covered sin so sin was still there but a man like Abraham and Isaac and all those coming down through there could prove that they were under the Covenant circumcision by showing it remember I told you last night you could physically go around you know the priest could go in the back corner and you could say look I'm a Jew okay so you're coming under the Covenant and you know that was so strong until it came down to the New Testament even after Jesus left even after the Holy Ghost came Peter and and Paul some of them brought Timothy or one of them into the temple and he wasn't circumcised because he was a gentile most Gentiles were circumcised because they didn't know anything about it they were just fleshly worldly people okay same way with here if you're uncircumcised now but now remember Paul said it's not circumcision or uncircumcision now of the flesh right but it's a circumcision of the heart which what works its way out into the flesh takes that excess flesh away it takes quite in other words this is kind of funny if you'll think about it but Abraham was 99 years old he circumcised himself he walks different you understand what I'm talking about the same way with Joshua when Joshua went over into the promised land before he went into the promised land he said wait a minute he said we've got all these kids under 20 years old that's never been circumcised so he took all them kids 20 years old males circumcised every one of them and the Bible said three days they stayed in their tent you understand what I'm saying well you women probably don't but you men know what I'm talking about it'd be a real hard to circumcise somebody especially yourself at 99 years old but it makes you walk different so there's the whole God had to bring something natural okay because they spoke natural and carnal in the in the Old Testament do's and don'ts you do this don't do this don't do this don't do that all right they spoke carnal so God had to speak carnal to them give them an outside showing right give them an outside showing but now once it come by the new birth now it's an inside showing but it doesn't do away with circumcision it just makes it a spiritual application coming back out and then it takes the excess of this guy your whole flesh and does away with the old part or the excess flesh that really does no good there's no good to that excess piece of Flesh it's just thrown away all right so same thing with here that accent when God circumcises your heart causes out the old stuff and you're a new creature you walk different okay your walk is definitely different so I just wanted to let brother around them uh there's there's a bunch down through here um you'll look over there to the side of the steel circumcision and all that but uh basically I love this uh where you can just sit and put the word in and man it just pops up and you got all these 175 quotes about circumcision is it just for the tablet for a laptop for phones also yeah I've got it on my phone it's free iPhone or but it is for your tablet but you can put it on your computer pick right yeah but it's a different but it's different it's the message okay but this one is just for a tablet or your or your phone and it's wonderful and it's it's quick really quick because I mean I pulled up 175 quotes just like that that's right I mean it's real fast used to 20 years ago if you'd have put in circumcision you could have went and got coffee and had a circumcision and come back and it still would have they still would have would have not been done Daddy put in a quote one time and it was like 3 000 3 000 Times Really around said it took a half a day for that thing to load up all the clothes he went and done something went out and worked and did something to come back and it was still loading up but but now man you just punch that button it's on there so yes in the Old Testament they didn't have the new birth to understand spirit that's correct it had to be natural everything in the Old Testament had to be a natural application because they sure there were prophets they were Isaiah and all the ones that could understand spiritual things but that was one Prophet to a nation of millions of people that was one profit even Kings had a problem a lot of times look at David like like brother Danny was preaching another name David had problems as a king and as a human being but without the new birth that's what you're always going to lean toward the flesh without a new birth you know that as well as I do hello we all lean to the flesh first right before the new birth right because that's why we were born in sand shaping in an equity and we needed to be born again what the old flesh cut off and then we have a new Walk On Christ so that was one of the that was the couple of questions and then now let's go to the uh I want to get to the sister Shepherd's dream LeBron Louise and Sister Christine we've been on the Statue of perfect man this is meal number 57 so we've been doing this since last Christmas I think and uh we really are we're getting to a point to where now I think it's going to take the Holy Ghost to do it to do this for us because the dream sister Shepard had a dream now brother Brown didn't cover this dream in the Statue of a perfect man why I don't think he put them together all right at first but once he preached the statue of a perfect man and then he goes and preaches Blasphemous names a week later he looks back on that dream and God brings it to his memory because I think she had the dream before he preached at the perfect man but remember nobody had ever taught this like this before now Peter said at dear Faith virtue knowledge tempered patience sure he was and the virtues but now as far as putting this together and sealing it with the Holy Ghost and and because remember the headstone hadn't come sure he was Jesus Christ but when he left he took that with him right right okay he was The Headstone sure he sent back a little bit on the day of Pentecost he sent back what the Cornerstone okay the bottom part the corner we were talking about that the other day you know if you make a little wine right here there's your Cornerstone it's the same thing as this and this is a little pyramid in itself yep so that's right you know and we may get into this after we finish this uh I preached a sermon on it several years ago but you got justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that doesn't stop there right you still have to add The Virtue right so you start with justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Spirit second stage coming in then right here when the Capstone comes it's a higher form of justification sanctification about 10 months ago you can't get past those three things every step you make because remember this part of justification down here yeah you did it that's right you did it that's right and you know you did it yeah you're right nobody's got to tell you you did it you know you did it because you did it okay but now you come on up here a little bit further you see that true justification is the real you didn't do okay okay the one that came from God that Holy Ghost that that logos that came down and became a part of your life it never sinned a day in its life but you've got to realize all up through here that comes right there the real you've never done it to start with and you gotta see that and you'll know that the real you all that all those things are um Paul says the former things have passed away or John did former things that passed away all things have become what new all right okay that is when this comes he said well we're down here yeah it's going to happen here for the people think of body change it's going to happen right here we're not going to get anybody change in the in the future home no we're gonna get our body change right here even the ones that die right are going to resurrect get a new body same body redeem yeah get there and you've got to have it to get there because this remember Flesh and Blood the Bible says flesh and blood will not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven what the flesh and blood that Samuel and Peggy Dale gave me will not make it there right that's why they call it a change you have to be changed right your atoms have to be changed your whole being has to be changed and you know what then you can say I've been circumcised you can say yeah I've been circumcised and come into the body of Christ by the Holy Ghost and right here remember in this dream sister Shepard saw trash coming out of the box so you still got trash in here right amen amen God's still working on me amen I Die daily Paul said well that's what Paul was saying I died of my knowledge every day I've died in my Temperance every day I've died on my patience because these are not my my virtues they're his virtue amen that when they're applied to me they become mine that's right I love that quote where brother Brown says this is my eye God gave it to me well see it was God's he'd give it to him but once you give it to somebody and then your brother around saying God's not an Indian giver well he's not doing that just to fill up tape space he's telling you that when God gives you something this is my eye God give it to him so it's mine so so God gives right for eternity so the New Birth when it comes to many Insurance God's New Birth but it's mine when I get it because remember brother Brown said it's you and him do they're in there as person vulcanized when he says vulcanize that when you vulcanize something you can't see the scene you can't see where he was and where you were see that's up here that's really showing that God's in here because remember that's what we're going to talk about we ever get to it this Holy Spirit the brother Bible said it molds and seals all this in because we still got cracks right we got cracks in our patients godliness Brothers but now when we have the true brotherly kindness like brother Brown had he'll seal it in brother Brown you know they always said that you couldn't tell who his enemies or his friends were whenever you know what you stay around me long enough you're gonna know who I like and who I don't like same way with you all of you so more than others so see some are growing more than others God will tell you where you're at he'll send somebody by just a show he'll send he'll cut you off in traffic just see hey temperatures he will do it brother Brown said God will put somebody in your way and say something out of the way to see how you'll react that's right now God knows how you're going to react but you don't know how you're going to react but once you do like that when when Daddy when that guy slap that down at General Motors well he knew then when he come to that place he knew then that his Temperance had come to a place where it wasn't before well see then you can glory in that and know that you've got you're at least going up that's right right you know he's going to try your Temperance and patience we've already been through these two things these two go together and they're hard okay they're real hard to get through but you know what the 120 in the upper room got through it women and men so we can get through it we've got more word than they've got we got more words than they have in in the new in the end of 120 Upper Room it's all right we did yes but right here is what our goal is our goal is here but let's finish let's read a little bit more all right let's read paragraph 128. I changed the fonts can you see those a little bit better so I can say bye okay can you see a little bit better I changed the fonts a little bit more so you can a little more plain running around after I'm an old man now he's talking about brotherly kindness because look without this thing right here here is our key because if we don't have this sealed in this is not going to come like it should now remember you get the Holy Ghost down here you get the new birth you're part of the Kingdom you're part of the body of Christ your son and daughter of God but you're a spirit baby that's right you're a baby down here a babbling crying father father that's what the Bible says you give the spirit of adoption whereby you cry and by father when I look you don't cry up here no ain't no crying up here this is the mature person this is somebody who knows how to handle the word of God because remember you get power down here power with characters fit to rule power without character satanic so you can't come to this place okay that's right man power with character right leave your character builder it's fit to rule power without character it's Italian now that doesn't mean you're you've got Satan in your soul but you it means that you there's some things you can't get rid of that's right and you got to get rid of these which part you want me to say you said power without character okay it's a town that means that you've got part of you don't have Satan in your soul but Satan can get into that realm of memory reason conscious about Hey listen people he plays in that really listen to me memory reason conscious affection imagination now that's the Devil's Playground see tastes Phil smelling here ain't got nothing to do with the Devil that's just to contact this world is what the prophet says that's why Adam was put in a flesh body in five senses to see tasteful smelling here now through that filter coming down to memory reason conscious facts and Imagination that's where Satan can get to it but he can't get in that center around that Center realm is what our is Faith or doubt that's right or fear or faith that's in the Cinderella there's only two characteristics in that Center room fear or faith now not like the fear like Ryan had Ryan had fear because of and I told him I said look I said the doctor's doing what they can do because this is flesh the doctors can work on this flesh that's what they're put here for okay but they can't do anything with your spirit console that has to come from God it has to be it has to be influenced by you when you walk into that room and you have fear the first thing that baby is going to feel is they're going to feel that fear first thing a person is going to feel when you walk in that room you're going to feel fear if there's fear there and there was okay but when you take that and say just don't fear walking you know you know what you have to be like Abraham Abraham didn't have a baby for 25 years right think of it people some of y'all have been alive 25 years or being brain dead for a few before that now you're kind of a little bit alive but okay really I mean your brain did do you about 30 anyway amen amen everybody's gonna agree with that because I was even born again you do things as as a young adult that you really wouldn't do when you're older okay oh fear the baby or any situation you have and and I don't want people to think that I'm I'm arrogant but but when you have when you just have so much faith and you just don't let something bother you Abraham had so much faith that things didn't bother him that's true because remember 25 years down the road he knew he couldn't perform you understand what I'm saying naturally so he got to a point and said Okay God you're gonna have to do it that's exactly because I can't do it anymore because remember he tried with Ishmael he could produce remember Abram could produce a child all right but when he got to Abraham it had to be God to change that man back so that's the same way with you and I because every certain other faith is going to go to this final Journey which in the end you're going to have to just look at any situation it's not going to matter how many cubes was in that baby doesn't matter how much uh drugs that was just for this thing that was just for this thing got it yeah that was for this thing that is circumstances that's something you see but your reasoning reasons that there's a problem there but God says hey I got the spirit and soul and that baby can't have faith right no yeah baby can't have faith so the doctors are doing all they can to keep that spirit inside that baby right think about that that officers are doing all they can to keep that spirit inside that baby but your faith is what's going to have to produce that healing of that child that's right so it doesn't matter how many tattoos earrings uh addicts drunk just name everything wives children wild children yeah right things good people preachers no anything we look at those memory reason conservation imagination and that's what Satan can grab a hold of him that's where he walks around them right because remember he reminds me of the things I did before but now remember that doesn't ever come before God right yes I'm forgiving down here of my past sense they will never be forgiven right I mean for God I mean they'll be forgotten they're forgiven I'm sorry but now remember in justification the next day you may smoke another cigarette or a curse or whatever you did before now God starts recording that again if I understand that God starts recording that again right right because it only justification down here only forgives you of your past Sin from that day you said God forgive me he'll forgive you and he won't ever remember that again but now the next week brother Brown said Remember the unclean spirit is still in there that's right he has to be driven out that's right so you still smoke drink cuss and do the things of the world that starts a recording again because I believe there's a lot of people being justified and there's a point in there that I think that if they died and God give them Grace and if they passed away that they'd be giving eternal life later on I because those who he's Justified is already glorified that's right you got to remember that right but true justification leads you to the Holy Ghost God knows that that true justification is going to take you through the steps and then the next step is sanctification where the unclean spirit is driven out see everybody thinks boy I don't cuss your drink no more because I'm born again no ain't got one thing to do with it you should have got that over in sanctification true sanctification showed me that those things were gone and I didn't have to go through them anymore that unclean Spirit was gone out of me and I did not have that desire now look it doesn't mean that if and God help me out it I chewed tobacco for 14 or 15 years so once God saved my soul that night up here he saved me it didn't fill me with the Holy Ghost he saved me okay got it he saved me that desire was gone I believe he justified and Sanctified me the same night why because I had had a background I knew the word of God I knew what I knew what justification was I knew what sanctification was just like these people on the day of Pentecost 120 in the upper room weren't born again Walking With Jesus but Jesus had been planting the word in their heart for three and a half years so they knew once that came quick and what was already in them now see the three thousand downstairs didn't get that because they never heard who is this Jesus all right who is this man you talking about but we believe we're pranked in our hearts we'll see they started down here right they started right here that's why the day of Pentecost there was two births same bird two different stages three thousand downstairs became Spirit babies in Christ amen and Brethren what should we do to be saved we got Peter when the Holy Ghost fell on Peter he didn't walk out and say men and brother what do we got to do to be saved no he was the one that knew what he had to do what they had to do to be saved right so they were right here but God had tutored them 120 in the upper room faith of the fathers got it yes three thousand downstairs was like me and you okay especially the ones that have never heard of the word or never been brought up in the message never heard a thing just came off the street justification sanitation baptism the Holy Ghost has to be a process right you have a question when you say driven out what's that done by the our diligence our praying and the word reading the Bible yeah the words the only things will drive an unclean Spirit out you can crack remember brother Brown he prayed for that woman prayed for that woman he went way back in her life she had left something off that she didn't get forgiven for so that was the Block in her life but remember the the husband and wife that that happened to remember she said he's got something to confess to you well remember if you'll keep reading on a couple of times he makes that point one time he comes in and meet us at well how are they he said they're fine he said they're fully restored in other words back in church well see that was all that unclean Spirit everything maybe they didn't have the new birth maybe they did then we don't know when you say driven out by the word you mean just by sitting listening to the word brother Brown you stay under the fountain and it'll wash you wash by the water of the word the Bible says I can't remember it's in John or somewhere do you remember reports that word says the unclean Spirit goes out of a man walks and dry places but remember Matthew but remember and we're going long I'm sorry remember in sanctification Satan can come back to you because remember them that one Spirit brings seven more of his buddies that's right worse than his that's right because he brings his religious friends with him this time sanctification is the most wonderful place you can be but it's the most horrible place that if you get stuck there you're not born again and if you died you got to go in your work Sam only by the new birth will you not have to worry about your work all right amen amen justification sanctification you're gonna have to stand at the white Throne judgment and you're gonna have to be judged by your words and the Bible says our works is filthy right but if we become born again that unclean Spirit goes out you keep him out by staying here the problem is you look at some people they'll come in here I believe they get Justified I believe they might start working on sanctification but what happens is they get just enough of a religious spirit till they think they got it all and then you don't see them anymore yeah so what happens I've seen it happen 10 times in this church they think they get they get a little religion well who is that there's one thing for sure if you start coming to church and then you quit Church it wasn't God yeah that's pretty plain he just wasn't gone it was gone there for a while but when he brought them Seven Devils his buddies back and made you feel religious and that you can talk to God yourself and you can get it for yourself and you can do all this for yourself that's not the prescription the prescription says go along to the new birth and then you this the faith that you have then listen to this the faith that you have will bring you to church because you know you don't have faith for yourself at that time you have faith in God that he's bringing something people now right here I believe that's faith in yourself what you say to this mountain see remember it comes from it comes from God giving you stuff and I don't mean stuff to be like God giving you things right just like we do as a child but when we grow up I mean Josh is not coming home saying I you know I fix me some breakfast I'm crying I'll go back no he's a man you got to be a man you got to walk in there and say hey I'm a man I can do my own thing now that's the same way with God God don't want you to cry to him all the time push it right here you are him okay and what you say yeah it's gonna happen Ryan you walk in the door and you say look you didn't have to walk in there and say baby get better no you just walked in with a little better attitude with a little more faith positive attitude a little more faith adoption here is fun you get in the head of the ball game yeah no the option is here so that's what we're going to talk about later but we got to get past this green first we got to go Richard Marlo is going to give me the Bad Evil Eye today come on get out of here he always does we'll get up there with me Hey listen reap left famous names and read sister Shepherd's dream if you've got a computer
