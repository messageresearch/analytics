========================================

more let's turn back to disa for 30 15 and the lower said unto Him will therefore whosoever slayeth Cain vinna shall be taking on him Sevenfold and the Lord said a mark upon pain like day fighting him to killing the last time we kind of flicked it a col this in the time how the neighbor deal with the unbeliever you're not supposed to take vengeance Phoenix is minus a 0 over and we were looking at the different scriptures down through the Bible to talk about how when someone crosses the line that it's time to just leave them alone you don't try to take videos like a lot of people get upset at what so much preaching to put up a website to destroy that person's good reputation or things like that that's what I'm getting it well then we'll look at oh but we stopped it dan and Ephraim we were talking about how is a yeah I said it went when they from join themselves to Isles got in the scripture it excessively promote they've joined himself to I don't believe all and then when I was going to next talk about this story of Polycarp for the First Church of Rome now the first church in Rome after that a lot of people don't really know how feeling is one don't really know where Andronicus and Junia came from how they heard about the gospel they speculate that they were one of the at the day of Pentecost when Peter delivered his message in the street after they were filled with the Holy Ghost power came down and here deliver just great sermon and told the keys to the kingdom repent be baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ and you can have the promise and many people believe that andronica Andronicus and Junia were a part of that congregation because there were people from all around all around the world there because they heard them in their different tongues and so at any rate Andronicus and Junia took the gospel to Rome because when in when Priscilla and Aquila travel to Rome to set up they wanted to set up a church they found that I'm darkest and Ginny and we're already there in Roma 67th Paul said it and drunken singh ji geum were before him in christ so they they heard about the gospel for paul did so the Roman Church was filled with mix there was a lot of a lot of people that came out of the Robin Roman paganism they're rolling because they you know that just because of the geographic location there were a lot of people that weren't Jews there they didn't know didn't have a solid background of the Jewish faith of the Old Testament Scriptures so when 4-cylinder cool i came to roman and they started helping geniune Andronicus to minister to the people there in Rome and teach them the old testament scriptures and held him to come grounded in it and the orthodox jews that were there they were very angry at when people would leave their ranks and become christians they would they would just do about anything to make moral and little church and through lots of little political intrigues and different things the Emperor Claudius decided that he was going to expel all the Jews from wrong and this is why we know that Peter was never in Rome because Claudius expel all the Jews from wrong during the time that he would have been there oh so Aquila and Priscilla would use Andronicus NGE or not Jonathan said you were thrown in prison and Aquila and Priscilla were left were kicked out of Rome so that left the little woman church without its background that's solid teachers to teach them the word from the Old Testament Scriptures oh so they began to go back in to bring ends their little Roman paganism ideas and different things from the from their history they started they what they did was a electic Andronicus was a leader of the church the pastor so when he left they elected someone needed to take his place and they called him a father and you know jesus said call no man father because you're not begotten of any man you begotten of God God as our Father you don't enter the kingdom of heaven because anyone but God it gives you the birth and so when they were when the four apostles finally were able to return to the to the church in Rome they were rejected and how to start a new journey the second second church in Rome oh so then facts for many years later to the Smyrna an age when Polycarp heard about how the first church in Rome was taking all these paganistic beliefs and had back slid he heard about the Passover changes and even though at this point he was under 90 years old he decided he's going to go talk to the new leader that was his name was Anna Cetus and this is all this is all found in a little book called how did it happen that I can't find it anywhere else besides it comes with the table if you get it from the war cigar that's all I play like a phone but it's just full of wonderful things about how the early church started and what happened after yeah so when Polycarp got to roll he you know he ministered and healed the sick and demons were cast out and many people heard about the things that girls doing Polycarp and so he went he heard of the listed here are at first hand of all the different things that were happening in Nancy's his church how they had started worship of the Sun how they faced easter parade which was a symbol of their old Roman pagan st they would face east to pray to their gods and they started they would serve the Eucharist but um they would keep the wine from the people and you know now even the demon in the Western Catholic Church date they do that today so I could grant but not the one and that's remember in jeremiah jeremiah there was a scripture I'm guy that wrote themselves who worked out here in the stack of my news but uh he talked about how the children the children gather wood the father's killed fire to make queen case to the queen of heaven and they pour out drinks as a libation and even back then he was testifying of what what I it just the same spirit just follows through all the way from back then when Jeremiah was prophesied to Tapani cars dead how do i doing the exact same thing they're given the little round wafer but holding back then the whiner sao paulo car beside he was going to have a conversation with a seat us and you find it sao paulo car went to the service he said on he said up there were being a seat us and after the service was over he said he talked to try to convince casitas of his hair of his ways and had a seat assess responses was we are too far going to turn back so God is really God's bubby words to buy a car and this is written by irina sand and if you look at him and I see him father I already heard this down may God's puppies worked probably caught my friend was married to his I all the land below so you just left them alone so we looked at we've looked at this Cain and Abel relationship from one perspective to leave them alone and not take vengeance so now let's turn and look it from another perspective which is you know down through delta through the Old Testament there's been a lot of when when CNN is a picture they there's been a lot of death justice so let's go it's difficult to reconcile to Cain was not killed and why were all the people down through history that blaming little limited children all of all that so um what I wanted to do was kind of run through the Old Testament Scriptures from the from Genesis all the way up to the time of Christ has a high level overview of all the justice capital punishment violence in the scripture and see where that takes us home so and keep in mind that the story of Cain and Abel is a type of how we relate to a believer when they turn down the message because Cain was turning down the message of Christ for his day and you don't take Venus but now that doesn't mean that we throw our owners around sin and embrace it when senators your family or your life then you take out a sort of the word that's late and so that's what where I'm going so let's turn to justice 138 and also burn to Genesis 9 just keep your finger on they're going to flip back for so everybody's familiar with just this one to a 6.7 2128 says and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion of an efficiency and I'm going to file the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth and Genesis 9 12 God's yachts changing the dispensation and God bless know any sense I said and then be fruitful and multiply and replace their the first multiplication it's a spiritual multiplication annex is now our sex of the end of the picture and where reproduction is made by natural reproduction justice 92 and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every pitch to the earth and a point every fouled the air Paul that moveth upon the earth and applause official of the sea into your hand are they deliver 120 80 puts man the over dominion over the fish to see and now the dread every animal is a poem the rid of you shall be home every beast of the earth let's go to justice 129 and we're just stayed in that same chapter once we know that God said behold I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree and in the which is the fruit of a tree and see to you it shall be for me when the next verses don't eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil but this let's compare this scripture was justice 93 and for every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you even as the green herb by giving you all things 94 plus flesh with a lot fairer which is the blood thereof shall you naughty so started out there is no death in the Garden of Eden Europe only there only eating vegetables vegetarians nothing no life was taken but then it just is not after the club then you can eat meat as long as you don't eat the blood and that not even blood carries over to axe the axe 1521 of the Apostles got together to discuss which which is kind of old Commandments would be carried over and eating blood was one of the things to abstain from along with the only animal strangled because they're both the title taking a life something murder just is 415 and this is the one we've been studying and justice 96 justice for 15 says and the Lord said unto him therefore whosoever slayeth Cain vision shall be taking on Sevenfold in the Lord set a mark upon pain when fighting your killer in this case God is taking just it's taking care of justice and we don't take vengeance no vengeance but God handles and justice now and just as 96 whoso sheddeth man's blood by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of God maybe man so now God hinge over justice to man because we are made in His image were made in His image so we should not be killed oh I should not be taken am because were made in His image we should have the ability to judge right and wrong and be able to determine whether someone is is a worthy of punishment for their further seeing the murder and I i found this what John Wesley said I just like to read what different people that feel all ghosts had seen it this is what he said before the flood is that she's seen by the story of Cain God took the punishment of murder into his own hands but now he committed this judgment two men two masters or families at first and afterwards to the heads of countries for in the image of God made man man is a creature due to his creator and therefore ought to be so to us God put honor upon him let's let us did not then put contempt upon him such remains of God's image are still even upon fallen man that he could unjustly killed a man to face it the image of God and death dishonor to you now as we read along through all the different times when p.m. or punished by death it keep in mind that the thing when sand enters a picture in your life during your family or in your church or in your country which is a lot of the theme is the nation of Israel they're getting rid of the nation X in from the nation then you got to get rid of it home a lot of people think that that what the law of God is to just embrace all sin or everything including sin but the love doesn't love seeing love of God doesn't um this is 321 oh I covered out on an evil bloody sense so God is the first one to he was the first one by his hand was a first blood taken and justice took over our sin and Genesis 423 see what kind of jumping the head down through gesture for to disappear so let me we mentioned last time how i met misinterpreted that vengeance is mine as anybody anybody can take videos themselves and so what he did was somebody somebody did something wrong to him and so he decided he was going to take their life and let makes it on these wild Lena Zilly Zilly hear my voice she was a little neck hearken unto my speech for I have slain a man to my wounding and a young man to my hurt and I think that's not what God meant at all I don't believe you that you're someone who does you wrong you take their life let's compare this to David's prayer in Psalm 79 Oh let's still down the worst team thanks my first nine help us Oh God about salvation for the glory of thy name and deliver us are Persian way our sins but I named state wherefore should they even say where is their God let it be known when the heat in our site by the revealing of the blood of I shirt servants what you see see Davis leaving it up to God not himself even remember all the stories of how they saw was put into David's hand but he wouldn't take his who wouldn't take videos because it was God anointed and we can learn some lessons about that today but don't say anything about your past or so behind their back get a God's anointed let the sign of the prisoner come before thee according to the greatest honor of that power preserve those that are appointed to die and render under our neighbors Sevenfold into their bosom they were approached wherewith they have a purse thee O Lord the same 74 approaches as a cane but God Dame is leaving it up to God he's not taking matters in his own hand so we die people as cheap of bypass she will give thee thanks forever we will show forth i play to all generations now let's jump on Jesus 611 the earth also was corrupt before God and the earth was filled with violence and God looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth and then move it for that's one of the reasons why God destroyed everything they own the earth because it was filled with violence and after flood god for justice and the man's hands to protect ourselves to deliver seeing from our midst and so we can implement justice and then we read in justice 956 who shot Sheriff man's blood by man shot luckyshare when we were comparing that to you on just for 15 so now let's jump up to Genesis 13 I'm not going to read the whole thing just kind of quickly talk about the topic here is Abraham and lot I had a little disagreement and instead of getting on vile about it Abraham just peacefully let a lot choose the greenest pastures for himself and justice 14 is the story about how now he was peaceful now lots herdman lot lot gets kidnapped by chit early Omer and so Abraham has aesthetic standing arm or anything me and it gives that to him and it brings him back and that's when he offers temperature ties to visit after he gets the prize from Chile Homer so even though he's a man of peace he's not going to put up with he he's defending himself in this case you know it's perfectly fine to you got a right to defend yourself fear not let's see an apron Justice 15 15 verse one after these things word of the Lord came Monday were having a vision saying through non april i am not sealed and I or even for God's sitting up a thing that he's our defense and he's the one that fights for us justice 17-6 and I will make the exceeding fruitful I will make nations of the king lee-char coming out of it my king is a ruler of our nation the nation is going to have to defend itself just 19 is where God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah from their scenic and then let's turn to another interesting story Deuteronomy chapter 17 17 17 just a little later what I want well anyway I'll just tell you the story this is the story of when the Amalekites came to attack the Israelites and what they did instead of just attacking them straight out they tanker stragglers in the back they love women and children and people that could not defend himself and because of that God told Moses to go attack neo and that's that story is an exodus chapter 17 I think that's what I did was just run the same chapter for both this is the story of when Moses Aaron and her went up to the top of the hill and Aaron and Hur held up Moses hands when his handle drop than it is uh the battle would would they start losing and as long as I his hands up and they would prevail and the reason that they will find Anna likes it I'm a licensed because of what they might like I said to them as they were in the wilderness they were you know they were attacking them in a very evil way attacking the feeble not my point do all this is that is that God allow allow the nation of Israel to defend itself Oh God that you got to put seeing out of your out of your midst and that's that's what the natural Old Testament it tightens a natural type of the New Testament spiritual and the Old Testament in take the sword and your riffs in the New Testament we get out on our knees and ask God deliver us even an Old Testament it wasn't by their Shore it was by got this period of Lord that was fighting their bowels but um just kind of an example for us to learn from and then an exodus 17 god promises to only pull out remember something like from under heaven because they they did the Nexus 19 almost time verses 7 through 9 is what we offer me with where Israel rejects grace and takes law and then in Exodus 20 the 10 commandments one of which is thou shalt not kill and the Ten Commandments doesn't elaborate on whether or not that I shall not kill includes capital push my dad comes later in Exodus 21 when God clarifies runner for Israel the next is 21 verse 12 he thus my turf a man said that he died shall be surely put to death now let me just go through some reasons I don't have scripture i have scripture for each of these but just for the sake of time the reasons why you can be put to death for the old testament sacrificing any of God then to home passing children to the fire mall where spin valve your false prophecy necromancy blasphemy Sabbath breaking an outsider it gets too close to the tabernacle rape adultery fornication marrying your wife's murder prostitution homosexuality best reality murder smiting a pair cursing a parent disobedient children kidnapping negligent homicide for example if your ox if you didn't have your opt-in and then when killed someone you could be killed contempt of court that's Deuteronomy 17 8 13 or false witness to a capital crime if you said they killed somebody and they didn't and your life was forfeit and I guess I'm gonna have to stop their next time we'll talk about the cities of refuge and how vengeance was still treated the same no Justin and oh please Cateel
