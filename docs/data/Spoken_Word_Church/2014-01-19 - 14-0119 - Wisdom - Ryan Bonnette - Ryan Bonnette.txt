and be with everything that is done today maybe for your glory in jesus name amen amen good morning good morning we're going to talk now on wisdom that's on now it may come as a surprise but sometimes i'm prone to being quiet so last sunday could anyone not hear me that's what i thought okay so especially when i'm reading y'all interrupt me and tell me if i'm getting too quiet i'll move this down we're going to see about getting the mic down here okay bob sometimes cause i'm kind of talking down when i'm reading especially so i'm real likely to get quiet okay we're going to talk about wisdom if you have your outline we're going to start with number one there are two types of wisdom worldly wisdom and god's wisdom i'll go ahead and read these definitions i have uh from the hebrew lexicon uh wisdom is skill as in war and administration shrewdness prudence and religious affairs and then um in the greek lexicon it's the the word is sophia which is broad and full of intelligence used of the knowledge of very diverse matters the wisdom which belongs to men specifically the varied knowledge of things human and divine acquired by acuteness and experience and summed up in maxims and proverbs the science and learning the act of interpreting dreams and always giving the sagest advice and the one i like the most here is skill and discretion and imparting christian truth the knowledge and practice of the requisites for godly and upright living yes if i may make a suggestion if you hold your paper up like this you'll project over to her oh okay i've got a lot of people you have your paper when you have your head down your voice tends to go down okay maybe i can just hold this yes put your nose in there that's right supreme intelligence such as belongs to god also to christ the wisdom of god is events in forming and executing councils and the formation and government of the world and the scriptures okay now part a 1a these two types of wisdom were first introduced and made available to mankind in the garden of eden the two trees the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil we're in the midst of the garden but adam and eve were told not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil okay and now last week we were talking about parenting see god was a good parent even back then he was a good parent to adam and eve and he told them not to touch you know not to partake of that tree not to eat of it lest you die he knew what would happen to him he didn't have to tell him you know he just told him you know you would die but he didn't have to tell him all the things that they would lose and everything that would happen he just told him don't touch it and they should have listened okay but eve uh listened to the devil's reasonings and and then adam knowingly walked into that okay part b the tree of life was the source of god's wisdom when adam and eve took of it they gained wisdom pertaining to the things of god wait excuse me it'd already be a yeah yeah okay pertaining to the things of god by this tree they could live forever okay this excites me to think about you know god before the world i always you know brother wade is big on genesis 1 26 i guess that's his favorite verse he's always talking about that genesis 1 26 man what excites me is back before that elohim god dwelling along with his attributes the elohim the self-existing one that had all of us in him and had all his attributes that he wanted to unfold himself and express himself and i love to read that volume one of the cld book the questions and answers on genesis those first few pages there where he's talking about elohim and out of him came up logos and then he began to speak and like a child playing for his father's door doorstep that just thrills me to think about how much power you know god had in him and he began to unfold and come down to a lower form where we could comprehend him and in him back then was wisdom and that's what i like to think about this wisdom that we're trying to protect of today that god's wisdom that was one of the things in him see the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was the source of worldly wisdom in their partaking of this tree mankind fell away from god losing the title deed to the earth and to eternal life okay and the breach between the seven churches and the seven seals in 63 03 17 in the evening brother banner said now the forfeited title deed is now in the hands of the original owner almighty god the title deed to the earth and to eternal life when adam forfeited it and satan's dirty hands could not take it so it went back to its original owner god himself and skipping down some the title deed to eternal life abstract title deed to eternal life when adam forfeited it for wisdom and instead of faith it went back to the hands of the owner almighty god he lost everything adam did he should have you know like said he should have listened to god to his parents he should have just done what he was told and and uh but anyway i'll stay back off the parenting subject now let's see oneness and 620211 what was the first thing that caused eve to disbelieve god's word it was because satan promised her more wisdom you will be wise you will see now you see the human race is always reaching after something and eve was reaching after more wisdom okay 62041 wisdom versus faith now when i first thought about teaching about wisdom the first thing that came to my mind is listening to that message wisdom versus faith and i began to think well i'm talking about one top list and brother branham was talking about how wisdom is contrary to faith so what's going on so i listened to that message and uh began to realize there's two different kinds of wisdoms they talked about wisdom versus faith i'm talking about wisdom versus wisdom the wisdom of the devil versus the wisdom of god so don't be confused about the title of that message he's talking about a bad wisdom versus faith okay um and so the wisdom that i want you to get straightened out on before we start there is a wisdom of god a wisdom of god is stay with his word okay that's god's wisdom stay with the world to every jot until you know but satan in his wisdom tried to twist the word so that's the wisdom i'm speaking of there's a certain amount of faith that goes with satan in order to accept satan you got to believe satan so there is a perverted faith to a perverted thing and anything that would try to twist the word of god to make it say something that it doesn't is the wrong spirit see offering wisdom against god's wisdom can everybody hear me okay wisdom versus faith again this is paragraph 197 of the same message wisdom as satan was presenting to her said you shall not surely die see let it's trying to make the word say something that it isn't so that's what wisdom is today oh brother how we carry on that seminary schools of theology that's their very nest that's their grassroots is trying to make god's word say something that it doesn't say and then paragraph 2 36 now see then as soon as she did that accepted wisdom with the word and wisdom was contrary to the word you understand amen see if wisdom is with the word and proves to be with the word and the word produces itself by the same thing then it is the word but if wisdom is against the word and not with the word but trying to find something to add to or take from it it's of the devil now i've got my pages my notes out of order here so okay uh in the second seal 6303-19 he said and if he's infinite he is omniscient if he's omniscient then he's omnipotent amen he's got to be that to be god see so he you can't say he learned more he didn't learn more he's the very fountain of all wisdom our wisdom here come from satan we inherited it from eve from eden where we swapped off faith for wisdom eve did okay now back to the outline number two these two types of wisdom are are still available to us today life and death are still set before us you don't have to turn i'm just reading one verse okay deuteronomy 30 19 i call heaven and earth to record this day against you that i have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live so we see we still have the two trees before us and we can we eat off of you know like that indian brother said when he's born again he said in here two dogs you know the white dog and the black dog and the one that we feed the most wins so we protect over the tree of life and see part a when we choose worldly wisdom as adam and eve we too will separate ourselves from fellowship with god and bear evil fruit in our lives a pool of bethesda in 1950 oh wait a living and dear friends don't you know that worldly wisdom is the thing that destroys the world in the garden of eden there were two trees one of them was the tree of life when man eat from that tree he'd live forever and the other was the tree of knowledge which was the tree of death which was the tree of sickness and later in that message he said god destroys nothing man destroys himself by worldly wisdom the first conflict that ever come into the world was because that somebody was seeking after worldly wisdom instead of simple faith in god i going to turn to proverbs 8 and we'll get to that here in just a few minutes we're going to read that whole chapter if we have time uh god's power to transform in 65 on 9 11 which it's all right to have wisdom but if the wisdom is contrary if the wisdom isn't correct wisdom from god divine wisdom and becomes natural wisdom i don't care how much science we have and what more or education it's of the devil i'll prove it to you the lord willing in a few minutes stop the devil civilization is of the devil i just got off got through preaching on that all the culture in the earth all powers of science and everything is of the devil and scot goss it's his gospel he preached the devil's gospel of knowledge in the garden of eden and he has took that knowledge perverted knowledge contrary to the word and will and plan of god and now he has had six thousand years to do just exactly what god did only in a perverted way and took the same amount of time to bring his own eden in now he has got an eden here on earth and it's filled with wisdom knowledge that was his gospel at the beginning knowledge wisdom science okay uh before we read that scripture let's see 2b uh num letter b on your outline did i already read b i'm getting old i don't remember like it used to when we choose god's wisdom we again partake of the tree of life and thereby yield fruits of holiness righteousness peace and all other good things of god that's right proverbs 8 1 like i said we're going to try to read this whole chapter with a few comments along the way so you see through this whole chapter wisdom is personified throughout as to me that's showing that god or that this is the wisdom of god and that i actually have a question on that i'm not going to ask you a question i'm supposed to be teaching but you know i believe god and his wisdom is him you know i believe in a condescending form but that's the question i have so anyway so i don't want to say something that's wrong verse one does not wisdom cry and her understanding put forth her voice see sometimes we think god is mute we think you know you have to really listen to god and you have to really be humble and walk soft and you do it's not that god is mute he talks pretty loud but we just don't listen right and you know everything declares god all nature and everything that you see the zodiac the pyramids everything you and like i was talking about last sunday our relationships are with our parenting and our marriage and things everything declares god we just need to my brother like my god tells brother dale sit down shut up just listen all right verse 2 she standeth in the top of high places by the way and the places of paths of the past she crieth at the gates had the entry of the city at the coming in at the doors unto you only and i call and my voice is to the sons of man see wisdom speaks now in first person throughout the rest of this chapter o ye simple understand wisdom and you fools be ye of an understanding heart now i like what he says there oh ye simple uh understand wisdom see god has to reveal the word unto debate such as we'll learn he's hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudent right yeah so it's to the sample here verse six for i will speak of excellent things and the opening of my lips shall be right things for my mouth shall speak truth and wickedness is an abomination to my lips all the words of my mouth are in righteousness there is nothing forward or perverse in them they are all plain to him that understandeth and write to them that find knowledge i like underline the word plain in my notes here because we always say things are deep you know and like brother dale is always accused of being a deep preacher it's really us because we don't understand something that's what we call deep yeah we understand it it's simple that's where brother dale earns this nickname of being the deep preacher i guess because people just don't understand what he's saying they need to sit down and listen for a few years and yeah right yeah what are you saying um let's see thank you receive my instruction and not silver and knowledge rather than choice gold see wisdom and knowledge go hand in hand wisdom is required to use knowledge you know there's i think a few quotes i came across and studying i don't have them right here with me but what brother branham talked about you have to have wisdom to know how to use your knowledge because these are in the nine spiritual gifts and it's what second one i think of the nine spiritual the nine gifts that uh you have to have wisdom and then you know how to use your knowledge for wisdom is better than rubies and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it i wisdom dwell with prudence and find out knowledge with of witty inventions the fear of the lord is to hate evil pride and arrogancy and the evil way and the forward mouth do i hate counsel is mine and sound wisdom i am understanding i have strength by me king's reign and princes decreed justice by me princes rule and nobles and all the judges of the earth i love them that love me and those that seek me early shall find me riches and honor are with me yea durable riches and righteousness these durable meaning you know they won't pass away worldly riches will pass away but not the word of god not this wisdom we're talking about verse 19 my fruit is better than gold yea than fine gold and my revenue than choice silver i lead in the way of righteousness in the midst of the paths of judgment that i may cause those that love me to inherit substance and i will fill their treasures the lord capital l ordeal elohim the lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old i was set up from everlasting from the beginning wherever the earth was when there were no depths i was brought forth when there were no fountains abounding with water before the mountains were settled before the hills was i brought forth while as yet he had not made the earth nor the fields nor the highest part of the dust of the world when he prepared the heavens i was there when he set a compass upon the face of the depth when he established the clouds above when he strengthened the fountains of the deep when he gave to the sea his decree that the waters should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundations of the earth then i was by him as one brought up with him and i was david his delight rejoicing always before him rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth and my delights were with the sons of men now therefore hearken unto me are ye children for blessed are they that keep my ways her instruction hope you hear instruction and be wise and refuse it not blessed is the man that heareth me watching daily at my gates waiting at the post of my doors for whoso findeth me findeth life and shall obtain favor of the lord but he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul and all they that hate me love death chapter 9 is also about wisdom but we will skip that one for sake of time um the second seal excuse me investments in 1962 11 24. remember it's the word that makes it right that was settled at the nazia council they took the other side the old prophets went back to their places with the truth you'll never kill it it's going on that's right see men scratch their heads and wonder just come to god if a man lacks wisdom let him ask god god reveals all things and makes the scriptures fit together notice okay um i'm trying to read my handwriting here okay i gotta write more slowly i want to read a verse or two out of first corinthians you don't have to turn to it because i'm just gonna skip around first corinthians 2 7 but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory but as it is written i have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god has prepared for them that love him okay first corinthians 1 19 for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the truth where is the wise where is the scribe where is the disputer of this world hath not god may foolish the wisdom of this world for after that and the wisdom of god the world thy wisdom knew not god it pleased god by the forcedness of preaching to save them that believed okay and colossians 1 19 for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that you be filled with the naught with the knowledge of his will and all wisdom and spiritual understanding that you might walk worthy of the lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of god okay and let's see and then now uh from psalms 111 you often go ahead and actually turn to uh my last scripture which is james three while you're turning there psalm 111 the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom a good understanding how all they that do his commandments his praise and birth forever proverbs 1 7 the fear of the lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction the fear of proverbs 9 10 the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the holy is understanding proverbs 15 33 the fear of the lord is the instruction of wisdom and before honor is humility and then proverbs 4 verse 5 give wisdom get understanding forget it not neither decline from the words of my mouth forsake her not and she shall preserve thee love her and she shall keep thee wisdom is in the prince wisdom is the principle thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding okay james 3 uh verse 14 but if you have bitter endings and strife in your hearts glory not and lie not against the truth this wisdom descendeth not from above but is earthly sensual devilish for where in being and strife is there is confusion and every evil word and then verse 17 but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceable gentle and easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy uh does anybody have any questions or answers or comments so you follow actually i got seven more but this is one that i thought i might come back to god's power to transform god can write god wrote the ten commandments with his own finger he wrote on the walls of babylon once with his finger he stooped down and wrote in the sand one time with his banger god could speak i can read gotham right god is the fountain of all grace and power and of all divine wisdom is in god so therefore knowing that he is the only creator there is there is no other creator but god satan cannot create at all he only perverts what's being created but god is the only creator therefore he created by his word he sent his word to all the seeds that he had placed upon the earth he formed those seeds by his own word and there was nothing else that could uh make the seed out to make the seed out of he had placed them and they were beneath the water he just said let there be and that was that um let's see okay that's it you're dismissed okay
