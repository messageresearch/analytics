[0:01] all right we're recording all right
[0:03] we're going to start a little early we
[0:05] we got to be out a little bit early
[0:06] today so got a long pre
[0:09] down I'm looking forward to it all right
[0:12] Matthew
[0:24] 5 Matthew
[0:28] 5 7 and 8 is where we're
[0:32] at blessed are the merciful for they
[0:36] shall obtain Mercy blessed are the pure
[0:39] in heart for they shall see God and
[0:41] we're kind of looking at both of these
[0:44] together and last time we looked at how
[0:46] in the um in the Old Testament time of
[0:49] the Passover Mercy was given to the pure
[0:53] in heart that wanted to see God and kind
[0:57] of talking about how Mercy can only be
[0:59] given by those who have been filled by
[1:01] the Holy Ghost it's kind of like a um I
[1:04] was reading some of the things that
[1:05] irenius talked about and he used this
[1:07] word vivify and vivify means to Quicken
[1:10] to give power and I got a quote we'll
[1:13] read when we get to what it means to see
[1:16] God about what irenia said about that
[1:19] but to vivify is kind of like what uh
[1:22] you can't um it's like if your if your
[1:24] car if your batteries run dead you got
[1:27] to find another car that has power in it
[1:29] to give power to your car right and uh
[1:33] that's kind of how Mercy is given if you
[1:36] don't have power within yourself to
[1:38] bring somebody to Christ then uh you can
[1:41] you could give food to the poor all day
[1:43] long you could uh do many different
[1:45] things do great works but uh real Mercy
[1:49] is bringing showing somebody how to
[1:52] escape the uh the wrath of God and
[1:54] bringing them to
[1:57] Salvation it it's it's uh one wonderful
[2:00] part of the work of of a Believer is to
[2:02] show show Mercy giving giving food to
[2:05] the poor and different things but if we
[2:08] don't uh if if they don't find Salvation
[2:11] then that's that's the key that's that's
[2:14] what Mercy that's the mercy that I'm
[2:15] talking about and blessed are the pure
[2:17] in heart for they shall see God so let's
[2:20] kind of
[2:22] review and John 20 22- 23 Jesus said
[2:27] when he had said this and what what did
[2:29] he say when he when it says and we had
[2:31] said this he right the scripture right
[2:32] before that said uh as the father sent
[2:35] me so send I you and he breathe on them
[2:38] and sayth unto them receive you the Holy
[2:40] Ghost whosoever sin you remit they are
[2:43] remitted unto them and whosoever sins ye
[2:45] retained they are retained that's that's
[2:48] the kind of Mercy that I'm talking about
[2:50] and you don't remit sins like the
[2:51] Catholic Church believes that you just
[2:53] uh randomly uh uh whoever they fits
[2:57] their political idea that whoever fits
[3:00] their mode of operation that agrees with
[3:04] what they agree but if you agree with
[3:06] the word then your sins can be forgiven
[3:09] and uh the way that sins were forgiven
[3:11] in the old in the in the New Testament
[3:13] when Peter came out on the day of
[3:15] Pentecost and said repent and be
[3:17] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:18] Christ if you line up with the word your
[3:21] sins will be
[3:22] forgiven uh and you'll be made pure in
[3:25] heart and
[3:28] uh
[3:30] so Peter had the the keys to the
[3:33] remittance of
[3:34] sin and after P Peter handed them out on
[3:37] the day of Pentecost then now we we also
[3:40] have the keys right because we know how
[3:42] to enter in and how to how to how to
[3:44] show Mercy to one
[3:46] another whosoever sins you remit they
[3:49] are remitted unto them and whosoever
[3:50] sins you retain they are retain if you
[3:53] show show mercy and has turned down then
[3:56] their their sins are
[3:58] retained God will not override free
[4:01] moral agency right and we were talking
[4:04] last time about uh the mercy seed and
[4:06] how uh in the Old Testament to to
[4:10] receive Mercy they always uh they
[4:12] brought their sacrifice into the um into
[4:14] the inner the inner court and uh always
[4:19] Desiring to come into the holy of holies
[4:21] which they couldn't do but now in in
[4:24] this day The Mercy Seat is in the heart
[4:27] of the believer and to receive Mercy
[4:30] you've got to hear it from somebody else
[4:32] who has their torch lit it's a Living
[4:35] Word
[4:40] uh and judgment always follows
[4:43] mercy and if you don't if you turn down
[4:47] judgment in in this
[4:49] uh you know the Catholics believe in
[4:52] purgatory but brother Rand said that
[4:54] this life here is Purgatory if you turn
[4:57] it down y if you turn it down here then
[5:01] you will be judged by last time we were
[5:03] talking about the Egyptian way believing
[5:05] that there was a your heart will be
[5:08] weighed against an ostrich feather which
[5:10] uh is really uh what a horrible place to
[5:13] be if you turn down the blood the
[5:16] atonement turn down the blood and you
[5:18] want to be judged by what you have done
[5:20] in this life that's exactly what if you
[5:23] go to the white Throne judgment how
[5:25] you'll be judged I saw the dead in
[5:27] Revelations 20 12 13 small and great
[5:29] stand before God and the books were open
[5:32] and another book was open which is The
[5:33] Book of Life and the dead were judged
[5:35] out of those things which were written
[5:36] in the books according to their works
[5:39] and the Sea gave up the dead which were
[5:40] in it and death and Hell delivered up
[5:42] the dead which were in them and they
[5:43] were judged every man according to their
[5:45] works that's about as much of that
[5:47] little picture I can fit on that screen
[5:50] um but
[5:53] that's what a horrible place to be
[5:57] according to their works and remember
[5:59] brother brand taught uh some works are
[6:02] greater than other works which is it's
[6:05] so paradoxical when when you come to be
[6:08] judged some men will say well look what
[6:10] I did I cast out Devils I did all of
[6:13] these things in your name and Jesus will
[6:16] say well well depart from me cuz I never
[6:18] knew you but then someone else will come
[6:20] and say I don't have anything to offer
[6:23] but they'll have just given one glass of
[6:25] water to a believer One just something
[6:28] simple because they did it to a Believer
[6:30] and just a little table quote I threw
[6:32] out there um somebody I I don't even
[6:36] remember where I got this from but they
[6:38] were traveling with brother Brandon when
[6:40] their car their car broke down and he uh
[6:42] the the this brother from the house came
[6:45] out to helped him fix the car and he
[6:48] went up to the uh to the house where the
[6:50] the man's wife was just to ask her for a
[6:53] cup of water so that she would get the
[6:55] same blessing that he did by help he
[6:58] helped them fix the the car so he wanted
[7:00] her to have that same promise that just
[7:03] giving a glass of water to someone that
[7:04] has that has their fire lit that's man a
[7:07] manifested Son of God would be saved at
[7:10] this
[7:11] day now it's uh such a horrible
[7:19] thing this this to be to to uh to give
[7:23] up the blood covering thisen listen to
[7:26] how horrible that brother brand talks
[7:28] about how horrible it would be need to
[7:29] stand at that white Throne judgment and
[7:33] um let start right here think of it only
[7:36] thing that'll back off God is blood and
[7:37] there's only one blood that he'll back
[7:39] from and that's his own son when he sees
[7:41] that that's his own son's blood he'll
[7:43] back back cuz that's the gift that is
[7:47] God has given to his son to redeem those
[7:49] who he fornew and it brings God back
[7:51] from his judgment but when that blood is
[7:53] removed and all that was forn has been
[7:56] called into the precious body his church
[7:57] has been made ready and taken up
[7:59] then God's Wrath is on the people now
[8:01] listen how horrible this oh brother
[8:03] don't never want to stand there let me
[8:06] stand before a machine gun let me be cut
[8:09] to Pieces let me be saw inch by inch let
[8:15] anything happen as the O oath of the
[8:17] knce of Columbus let them split open my
[8:21] belly and burn sulfur and everything
[8:25] else in me and my arms and legs cut off
[8:30] whatever it may be but never let me
[8:33] stand at that white Throne judgment
[8:35] before God oh let me take this little
[8:38] throne here before the seat of Christ
[8:39] and accept his blood nothing in my arms
[8:42] I bring Lord now that's the kind of
[8:45] Mercy I'm talking about Mercy to help
[8:47] others escape
[8:49] this and if you turn that down Mercy
[8:52] that comes out of someone who's got
[8:54] their fire lit and um that's what's
[8:58] waiting
[8:59] what a horrible place to be weighed by
[9:02] the ostrich feathers really what it
[9:04] amounts to so the pure in heart let's
[9:08] look what it means to be pure in heart
[9:10] because the pure in heart will see God
[9:12] take that bottom piece and push it
[9:13] towards your face that oh that
[9:18] one funny
[9:20] ear my ear my ear T to
[9:25] you first Peter chapter 1 22- 23
[9:30] seeing ye have purified your soul and
[9:32] obeying the truth through the spirit and
[9:34] the unan love of the Brethren see that
[9:36] you love one another with a pure heart
[9:38] fervently a pure heart remember pure
[9:41] means there's just that one thing you
[9:44] don't have any G or bitterness or
[9:47] anything mixed in being born again not
[9:50] of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible
[9:52] by the word of God which liveth and
[9:54] abideth
[9:55] forever now that getting into pure and
[9:58] art the reason I read the scripture in
[10:00] the Old Testament about the Passover is
[10:02] because it ties it all together you got
[10:04] mercy and you got what they did was they
[10:07] got 11 out of their house 11 is
[10:12] impurity mixing mixing things
[10:15] in the definition of pure that uh
[10:19] according to strong concordance is clean
[10:21] pure purified by fire and in a medical
[10:24] sense clean um ethically free from
[10:27] corrupt desire from sin and guilt free
[10:29] from every admixture of what is false
[10:31] sincere genuine blameless innocent
[10:33] unstained with the guilt of
[10:37] anything without any extraneous and
[10:40] unnecessary elements wholesome and
[10:42] untainted by immorality perfectly in
[10:45] tune of unmixed origin or descent
[10:48] involving or containing nothing else
[10:51] but just what if it's pure gold is
[10:55] nothing but gold if it's pure diamond
[10:56] it's nothing but Diamond if it's pure
[10:59] word is nothing but
[11:01] word and
[11:03] adoption F said what makes them peculiar
[11:06] you are a holy nation what have you done
[11:08] entered out of that land you're over in
[11:09] another land how'd you get over there
[11:10] that's the promised land what kind of a
[11:12] promise it shall come to pass in the
[11:13] last days sayth God I will pour out my
[11:15] spirit upon All Flesh by one Spirit we
[11:19] are all baptized in this one promised
[11:21] land with the purity of heart no
[11:23] jealousy no emity nothing I don't care
[11:25] if a brother goes astray no matter what
[11:27] he does you'll go after after
[11:31] him what was the Holy Ghost given for if
[11:34] you're a citizen of the kingdom of God
[11:36] how does it make you act like God does
[11:38] in his kingdom now what does God do in
[11:40] his kingdom it's Holiness righteousness
[11:42] purity of thought purity of mind power
[11:45] and love going to the Lost Healing The
[11:48] Sick performing Miracles doing great
[11:49] things now I'm kind of uh my thought is
[11:53] kind of scattered around we're narrowing
[11:54] it down to purity of
[11:57] heart let's add to our in the stature of
[12:01] perfect man 1962 let's add to our faith
[12:03] these things then that we might come in
[12:05] the full stature of Christ being joined
[12:08] together with Godly love fear of God
[12:10] reverence in our heart to one another
[12:11] deep respect to one another brotherly
[12:13] and sisterly kindness never vulgarity
[12:15] nothing but just the purity of Holy
[12:18] Ghost living see live together be a
[12:20] Christian walk with faith let the virtue
[12:22] of God flow through you let the
[12:24] knowledge God what comes to right and
[12:25] wrong just pure
[12:27] living
[12:30] the 70th week of Daniel now here's where
[12:32] we're narrow it down to Pure in heart
[12:35] you notice uh there's not too much light
[12:38] someone was seen the drawing of it up
[12:40] there said shame on you brother Brandon
[12:42] this great day of
[12:45] Enlightenment a great day of
[12:46] Enlightenment where you can if you have
[12:48] any question you got go out on the
[12:49] internet and ask ask Google to find it
[12:52] for you you can ask anything but at the
[12:55] same time you got all of the message on
[12:58] the computer and you you can ask you
[12:59] find if you have any question uh you can
[13:02] go search it but um you know the devil's
[13:05] got his his copy uh we got we got all of
[13:10] all of this information but see what
[13:13] pure of heart is I said I'll imagine
[13:15] when it's sifted down that that doesn't
[13:16] even do it justice when you get the real
[13:19] pure in heart Born Again of the spirit
[13:22] remember this was the only church age
[13:23] that Christ was put out of his own
[13:25] church of all of them so few that really
[13:28] really want to know about God really
[13:31] want to find his ways and find
[13:35] uh and want to exclude all of the leav
[13:38] from their doctrinal
[13:40] ideas from their uh to to uh destroy
[13:45] their own reason and memory and things
[13:48] and the end time evangelism
[13:50] 1962 uh God's looking for character not
[13:52] membership character elaser when he went
[13:54] to get the Bride of Isaac he sweated it
[13:56] out until he found character remember
[13:58] Abra and put him responsible as God puts
[14:00] us responsible that's right we ministers
[14:04] hunt my bride God bless your heart I
[14:05] ain't looking for members I'm looking
[14:08] for the pure in heart see somebody that
[14:11] will believe the
[14:13] word and that um I think that that sums
[14:17] it up pretty much the pure in heart
[14:19] don't want to take any leav of the world
[14:22] they want to live pure Pure Clean lives
[14:24] because the pure and heart are
[14:26] interested in the UN adulterated word of
[14:29] God right that's what the pure and heart
[14:31] are interested in now you you come get
[14:34] come and get the Holy Ghost and then God
[14:36] continues to purify you through your
[14:38] walk with Christ um a lot you might
[14:42] might have heard Zach got his black belt
[14:44] yesterday and uh I was I of course I
[14:47] started typing a little bit about how
[14:50] the black
[14:51] Bell you know the black belt is kind of
[14:53] like getting the Holy Ghost cuz you uh
[14:56] you think the end goal is to get your
[14:57] black belt and then you're done so you
[15:00] spend uh your uh spend you know Zach's
[15:03] been working on his black belt for 3
[15:04] years you think once you got once you
[15:08] got the Holy Ghost well that's all I
[15:09] need but the the Holy Ghost has put you
[15:12] right there at Faith and you still got a
[15:15] journey you got to continue to be
[15:17] purified and molded In His Image take
[15:20] all the living
[15:21] out and uh it's a continual process
[15:25] right on up the statue of a perfect man
[15:28] now First Corinthians chapter 5 kind of
[15:31] combines all a lot of the things that
[15:33] we've been talking about mourning uh
[15:36] Purity getting rid of the Leon in your
[15:38] life and so let's kind of read this 1
[15:41] Corinthians 5 and we got about more
[15:44] minutes it is reported commonly commonly
[15:48] that there is for fornication among you
[15:51] and such fornication as is not so much
[15:54] name as named among the Gentiles that
[15:56] one should have his father's wife
[15:59] and you know for in 1 Corinthians 5 the
[16:02] whole book of First Corinthians Paul is
[16:04] just nailing the First Corinthians and
[16:06] he's really he's telling them you're not
[16:07] mourning you're not doing what you're
[16:09] supposed to do then skip over to Second
[16:11] Corinthians and he tells them you you uh
[16:15] now you begun to Godly sorrow and he
[16:17] tells them how he's proud of them and uh
[16:19] they got rid of the 11av in their lives
[16:22] and and ye are puffed up and have not
[16:25] rather mourned that he that hath done
[16:27] this deed might be taken away from you
[16:30] for I verely as absent in body but
[16:32] present in spirit have judged already as
[16:35] though I were present concerning him
[16:36] that ha so done this deed in the name of
[16:38] our Lord Jesus Christ when you are
[16:39] gathered together and my spirit with the
[16:42] power of our Lord Jesus Christ to
[16:45] deliver such and one un Satan for the
[16:47] destruction of the flesh that the spirit
[16:49] may be saved in the day of the Lord
[16:51] Jesus your glory is not good know ye not
[16:55] that a little leth a little leav leth
[16:58] the whole
[16:59] L going back to the the
[17:02] Passover mourning uh getting rid of all
[17:05] of the sin in their life purge out
[17:07] therefore the old Leen that you may be a
[17:09] new lump as you are unleavened for even
[17:12] Christ Our Passover is sacrifice for us
[17:15] therefore let us keep the feast because
[17:17] the Passover is not just an event that
[17:19] happens every month when you take
[17:21] communion or every uh once a year for
[17:24] the Jews but it's a life Sanctified in
[17:28] Christ a life a life live that's why you
[17:30] take communion because you have
[17:32] communion with God you take the bread
[17:35] because you have received his word and
[17:37] you take the wine because the
[17:39] stimulation of Revelation Reveals His
[17:41] word to you and quickens it so let's
[17:43] keep the feast not with old leav neither
[17:46] with the leaven of malice and wickedness
[17:49] but with the unleavened bread of
[17:50] sincerity and truth and that's what they
[17:52] did in second Corinthians and brother B
[17:55] talked about how this man and and in uh
[17:59] 2 Corinthians 7:12 he talked about how
[18:02] this man uh was restored and of course
[18:05] only a prophet could show us in how in
[18:08] second Corinthians he was
[18:10] restored to bring that out right
[18:15] um what is left Galatians
[18:18] 578 ye did run well who did hinder you
[18:21] that you should not obey the truth this
[18:23] persuasion cometh not of him that cth
[18:25] you little Le leth the whole LP
[18:28] this is the definition of what leav is
[18:31] leav hinders
[18:33] you and it's a
[18:35] persuasion that doesn't come from him
[18:37] that calth you it's a little a little
[18:40] thing that has influence it turns a
[18:42] little thing that slowly begins to take
[18:44] over a little thing that seems like it's
[18:48] not uh not something big but slowly
[18:53] begins to grow and and
[18:56] influence and that over time
[18:58] if you don't check it a little leav leth
[19:02] the whole lump one remember in the
[19:04] beginning one word off is what caused
[19:07] all the problems we have that little 11
[19:10] caused all of the sickness all of the
[19:12] Wars all the heartache that has ever
[19:16] occurred that's what 11 is Galatians 578
[19:20] thank you and the pure in heart shall
[19:23] see God let's kind of look at this if
[19:25] you if you're pure in heart and desire
[19:28] to only see the UNL word of God then
[19:31] you'll see him and uh you know brother
[19:34] brand talked about that little that
[19:35] little child in his church that uh uh
[19:38] wanted to see God and went to the mama
[19:41] and the mama said
[19:43] uh uh you need to go talk to the pastor
[19:46] and the Pastor said well no man can see
[19:47] God and uh finally ended up talking to a
[19:50] deacon at brother Brandon's church and
[19:52] he said everywhere I look I see God so
[19:56] and that's what arenus said
[19:59] we'll get to that in a second uh but
[20:02] first let's look at this scripture the
[20:04] this is this is kind of a uh every
[20:07] scripture in the Bible is just worded so
[20:09] perfectly and you know a lot of
[20:11] translations will tra trans will will
[20:13] word the scripture a little differently
[20:17] but Matthew 62223 the light of the body
[20:19] is the eye if therefore thine eye be
[20:23] single thine eye not Thine Eyes thine
[20:27] eye be single thy whole body shall be
[20:29] full of light but if thine eye be evil
[20:32] thy whole body shall be full of Darkness
[20:35] if therefore the light that is in thee
[20:37] be
[20:38] Darkness how great is that
[20:41] Darkness now your light the light of the
[20:43] body is the eye the light of the body is
[20:45] a window that illuminates you to be to
[20:48] your the members of your body to be able
[20:50] to walk to be able to communicate to be
[20:52] able to interact with your environment
[20:54] just like the light of your soul the the
[20:57] Eye of your soul
[20:59] illuminates your whole being to be able
[21:01] to uh to see God and if your your eye if
[21:06] your eye is uh the eye of your spiritual
[21:09] being is uh is not single you wanton the
[21:14] things of God but at the same time
[21:15] you're uh eyeing the things of the world
[21:20] um your whole body will be full of
[21:23] Darkness because you can't serve both
[21:24] man and God if therefore the light that
[21:27] is in the be Darkness how great is that
[21:29] Darkness right but the eye if the eye is
[21:34] pure without any living then you will
[21:37] see God right by Open the Eyes of My
[21:40] Heart Lord that's what we sing now
[21:43] arenus on and we'll finish on this quote
[21:46] irenius on seeing God this is kind of a
[21:49] long quote but he he just uh this is
[21:52] what he wrote about seeing
[21:54] God for as those who see the light are
[21:58] within the light and partake of his
[22:00] agancy
[22:01] even so those who see God are in God and
[22:05] receive of his splendor but his Splendor
[22:08] vivifies them remember that's that word
[22:10] that means Quicken gives them power his
[22:13] Splendor vivifies them those therefore
[22:15] who SE God do receive life and for this
[22:19] reason he although Beyond Comprehension
[22:22] and boundless and invisible rendered
[22:25] himself visible and comprehensive
[22:28] and within the capacity of those who
[22:30] believe that he might vivify those who
[22:33] receive and behold him through
[22:36] faith for as his greatness is past
[22:38] finding out so also his goodness is
[22:42] beyond expression by which having been
[22:44] seen he bestows life upon those who see
[22:47] him it is not possible to live apart
[22:50] from life and the means of life is found
[22:54] in fellowship with God but fellowship
[22:56] with God is to know know God and to
[22:59] enjoy his
[23:00] goodness men therefore shall see God
[23:03] that they may live being made Immortal
[23:07] by th sight and attaining even unto God
[23:10] which as I have already said was
[23:13] declared figuratively by the prophets
[23:16] that God should be seen by men who bear
[23:18] his spirit in them and do always wait
[23:21] patiently for his coming and next time
[23:25] we'll look at how we see God in his
[23:27] univers in his word and his people and
[23:30] in his
[23:38] son
