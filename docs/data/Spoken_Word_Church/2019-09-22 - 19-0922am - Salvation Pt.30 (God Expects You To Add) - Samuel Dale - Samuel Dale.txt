brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity where if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful and the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated to the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word we had a real good time yesterday at the you will just pray for brother Homer he's having a lot of problems sometimes you know sicknesses up and they can't get him straight on a lot of things so remember that and keep him in your prayers but we had had a good time good fellowship over and back and we got there in and you know the sisters they got up we've had sister Trudy and sister Anna and sister Nala got up to sing and they set the place on fire so everything was going pretty good and all at once said this started like an old Pentecostal meeting there was a lot of shouting going home and dancing around and everything and you know we was always doing pretty good but you know we just had a good time doing it in the Lord and you'd never guess who was the last one died since you never guess they had to him just kind of got and you know all dinner sailed and had a good time fellowship in our Amen all right now we're talking about the stature of a perfect man trying to understand what is expected of us in this generation or date all right now we're not concerned with what other ages are we're concerned with this age so that's what I want you to think on is that to me I you know you can say well this age is this and this age is that I want I'm wanting us to talk about the alive word that is in the age that we're in now the you know the alive word right now what was paisa spice what future is future with the prophet said that was our biggest mistake that we made we either go backward or we go forward and we feel failed to see what's taking place right now what others don't see much going on well then you know what's wrong you you so we're just dead apart Luther that means you're dead you know because you you ain't gonna say they're dead up there are you you're gonna say we did you're gonna say it like we did but what you mean is everybody's dead but me and I'm trying to tell you how dead all y'all are but just remember the word Wiis means we okay but now talking about the statue of a perfect man because to me that is one of the most gracious wonderful what else could you call it to have an experience to be able to understand the Bible and to walk in the light of the hour that we're living and to see the Prophet came to bring us these things and to bring into manifestation in our hearts and lives and we'll read in a minute these are the things the Prophet said God expects us to add well see then if he expects us I remember Richards when he came down from Tennessee years ago and and you know he said I was in this series or top in it and he said oh well I didn't know this these things was expected of us well what do you think it sitting that far I mean if it ain't expect to tear it out man telling me one time that to give sometimes order but you still got to give me a Bible you know I mean I just ripped it out of it you know because if it's not there what do we need it for you know it's this space you know but I see in this day that the biggest thing that we all we all be us me too is that we're not thinking about what's taking place we're looking back and we're looking forward we're not following what's taking place well when are we going to get to that position to think on these things all right now the Prophet said it was I said we'll read it a minute he said these are the things that God expects us go ahead well I can't do nothing well you know maybe we need to listen because I think we've had long enough to play around of 50 years since we're leaving of the profit right I think it's time to be serious about where we're at and what we're doing because things are getting bad everywhere else and you know so then let's let's consider that all right but now think about it our last message we were talking about the one thing that I believe holds a great key is to wear that it is a reading there in the scripture in verse 5 it says add to your faith now it doesn't say add faith this says add to your faith then it says add virtue all right now what was the emphasis faith is not a virtue in that respect it is a gift Ardi gift it is the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Prophet said have faith and be born again he said these are the things that you know that God expects of us first he said how faith and be born again all right see then faith is not a virtue or something it is not even added he added he gave us his life all right he gave us eternal life that's the faith that it's talking about all right and that faith then becomes a part of us it's a part of his life given to us to make us sons and daughters of a living God all right see then it becomes my faith because he gave it to me right he gave us the new birth then we ought to rejoice about what he has given us all right but then think about it see it's not a faith it's not an ad it's a foundation the Prophet covered we gave it over and over and over where he says the foundation of all Christianity is based upon faith in the Word of God all right so then you'd say well what's it all over there all right upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it so then the church is build up on faith faith you know well then get faith and really in what it is it is the new birth how faith and be born again it's the new birth well I don't understand what you mean by that I tried to emphasize it real good to life service they're talking about that we we look at faith as being some something that we can attain see we put something way up head when we look at the pyramid you know and we say well I don't know I may be done in here now but I just don't see I'm up in here these well it may be true but it's there for us all right and the Prophet said these are the things that God these are the things that God that he expects you to add so well I can't add nothing no but we can make ourselves available Christianity is not something you can work up in or do but you have to make yourself available that's the main point if we won't do that then God can't help us anyway all right make ourself available make yourself open study the word the read the Bible and do it brother was preaching - not on the you know about the cell phones and how to do it and I marked down a little thing on mine because he he says that there's they're medically saying now that there's a little knot on the back of the head of people that's coming up right here on the back you know why cellphone people are doing down so much to do now this is serious he wasn't kidding he was given the medical thing and I'm you know I didn't realize maybe I missed the point but he said it was like 78 percent of the American people her cell phone I believe that's about what he was just saying I don't number and let me give her numbers like 300,000 Americans you know out of that 250,000 or more he's got cell phones see and that's you know that was his point to express what we're doing and he said that they've medically said people are bending over you know you've had so much throw you seen it with with computers with women typist and things that have problems because they're bent over and everything well he said they've been well that's doing pretty good and so what's taking over what's taking over in Our Lives taking over what we have young yeah we have phones are good they got a reason the purpose for being here and they're good you know that's fine but now when you you can't even curl in a conversation because of people you know green or anything and in that don't don't think you're fooling me I know a lot of you're sitting there now looking over oh you got the phone hidden then you're sitting there ok then we expect the Statue of a perfect man to be building us if we were studying my point if we were studying the message like we have everything else I think it would help us don't you I mean ain't that serious enough that if we were putting our hearts and our minds to studying the message and letting our children study it from that the brothers was talking about a three-year-old with a cell phone you know I mean you got kids now they you know I mean Lily Lily do better on the cell phone and I can she's overtired a little finger going and getting these things and she'll pick up the essence here that's good no you can't so I used mine for what it's to be huge folks okay not telling you to throw it in a trash can mine got throwed in the light but you know listen church my whole point is what is the thoughts in our mind of the day and the hour that we're living should it not be that our whole thoughts should be based upon Christianity our goal should be to know the Word of God to study the Word of God right that should be our whole goal because that now we'll get to that in a minute because you asked me said well how do you get these virtues it's gonna have to come from the word all right so we'll get to that point in a minute but what I want you to think about now hold that point have faith and be born again all right then these are the things that God expects us to add well it's expected you say yeah but I can't add it but you can make yourself available the Word of God no just like I said I don't wanna raise the hands but how many's read statue a perfect man since I asked you to read it or listen to the tape well my kids they just don't do they don't pop that really Angelica sadhana learn listen to the tape a little it'll change things okay but now listen faith is not a virtue it is the foundation that everything is based on upon this rock I'll build my church it's built upon the revelation of the word of God what was the Prophet to do I thought that the purpose of the sending of the Prophet was for us to receive the word back in the original form that it was in the book of Acts and the things you know or the writing of the Bible and thing the face of the father's which you don't hear anything about the face of the father's no no not will be on dad well how'd you get that question oh we're way up here how did you get well you know I'm up here too I'm up here to top with your love how did you get that well I got love filling our gospel make it yours which one you think you got all right but think about what we're saying now a house is held up by the foundation right it is not suspended out in mid are held up by skyhook you ever heard those statements you know what a people you know we used to say it and they say well how that this puts you a skyhook out there you know just hang it up the sky well now you you know I didn't got much sense to think that that would work because it won't hold it up all right but now see the foundation of all Christianity is based upon the Revelation faith because faith is a revelation right all of Christianity is based upon the revelation of God's Word we have we know more about all the other things and we know about God's Word right you know we read everything else but we don't know you can tell how much this is and how much that is and what percentage is isn't what that is and all the things all the different things you've got and you say well what about this in the Bible well we're beyond that well I love asking question how'd you get that I mean if you have reached I'm serious now women come on everybody in the building I'm serious if you know how to get to I've been toasted well people at Lulla don't believe like I believe I believe this not but everybody don't believe like I believe will let may be true but is it true or what but I'm open I'm open and I pay you okay women men and all we we don't believe in women preachers but we're gonna make an exception if you know how to get to the Statue of a perfect man all right wayde's off this afternoon he's supposed to be preaching but he just got took out of the way for you now if you know how to I don't think I mean it seriously if you know how to get to the Statue of perfect man we need for you to pre preach to us or teach to us and we'll make an exception we let you women stand out front and you can tell us all about how to get there cuz I want to get to there if these are the things God expects right yes / - don't want Ellucian to me you don't want to listen good you don't have nothing I'm not afraid I'm not afraid about what I believe and what I say and I'm not scared to say it and to tell you like it is because that's where I stand all right but now listen if the card expects us to add these things then there's one thing for certain if he expects it he has already made away right for us to receive it or he wouldn't expect it so he sent to profit right well we need to know about this we know when I ain't got time to read the prophets message you know he sent a prophet in vain if he's not willing to back up what he said and waiting to back it up so whose problem has it been for 50 years us and that us means starting me here through you all right because we know everything else but we don't know about the DES message all right now listen add to your foundation okay you build a house search for the Tony different ones that are our carpenters you know most of us are a little bit in that line of mine and we know as I said we don't hang them out on the sky hook we build a foundation but make your foundation the Bible says sure all right now you're gonna build a 10 story building then you go out there and you just clear it off and you just start letting your blocks know I won't do in a house let alone 10 story building you know something gonna cave in and hurry right you got to get that foot and right that foundation alright and I'm like this I'm bigger is better I guess you call it if to me you're gonna pour six inches of concrete will one up or eight inches what are the purposes and then they're only required we talk about requirements of what the law of what this land says or whatever I'm talking about Christianity if we're gonna work for 10% why not work for a hundred percent in Christianity because you're going to see in a minute when we get down to the point of thinking about it because there's some words brother branham used that has to be brought and I was gonna bring some of that today but I'm laying the background for it the I know the prophet will make a statement but you've got to place that statement in the correct order now like he says about virtue for instance he said now that doesn't mean live a virgin life well is it okay not to live I mean it is he meaning it's okay to not live a virgin life no he's meaning that's supposed to be settled in your faith right it's not a question of whether or not you're supposed to live a virgin life that's not a question that's not a thought there's gonna be a Christian you're supposed to be a Christian well I don't know where whether I should cut my hair or where I should do this or what you know I don't know if I do they're gonna if I don't they're gonna know like I said we talk about things that brother branham brought when he did not to bring them the Bible already said it the Bible already told you not to cut you her not to punch your face the Bible says that when are we going to just read it you realize what you're doing you realize by not accepting what the Word of God says now God had to send a prophet are you with me because the people wouldn't do it so he sent the Prophet to do it yeah why did he send a prophet to America oh we have what we're good well I've heard this one that knew God God sent it to America we got the money to send it to the world boy your corner what kind of a spirituality do you think that is think of some little bitty things that you make us I'm not throwing off on him this little straight it's 150 something miles long about 50 miles wide god what a couple of mile forgot how many million people 1 million people God could send this message or this Bible or this things to them the world from Jamaica Buddha book no no no he said to America called he sent it to America because we're the ones that are the worst why did the Prophet come he don't come because of money he don't need money he come because this land was the worst garbage can that there is in the world this America that we call right because we think we're so spiritual you know that a prophet is a condemnation to a nation you don't read them do you know it's central night it's got a compound meaning it's sent to the nation to save it yes but to condemn it also what's that I'm just playing a point for you to think about because we take something and we'll read it and we use it instead of understanding and letting it enhance us we use it for corrective forms but I know what that that's just my mind huh we use it to correct with instead of using it to develop from you say something about virtue well brother Brennan said that's not living a virgin life what is it okay to live like the devil is that what you're saying are you saying that he's saying it's okay to go ahead and do these other cuz this over here is not what its meaning he's just illustrating the one natural thing because that virtue I'll get this part in and I'll back up to the next service if you ever looked at will see what virtue means and we've ever just looked up see what virtue means according Webster virtue is moral excellence goodness righteousness conformity in life and conduct to morale and never how you say ethical I'm very pronounced that word principles a good or admire ability that's lack of a person another thing or whatever one right I brought it down to avert you mean strength now did that woman draw virtue from Jesus did she look at himself when we look at muscles man I bet he could pick up 200-pound strength well we've got a good spiritual thing going today at Lee we didn't know it meant like that what about that he just means strength the life that Jesus lived before that woman was where she got that strength from to believe we'll get back to those things I just want you to think on it because what I want you to think on is we we take something of what we want it to be we make it two things we want it to be and then somebody said something quick as I say it we just what we click well he don't know what he's on that virtue hurts your strength we don't we don't worry that setting the book you know you don't need to be in the book you need to be in the hearts and lives of the people a living Bible instead of the letters on page she is taking up on us and watch the definition we'll get back to that definition later and we'll cover it on because it's not to just say well it's not a virgin well the Prophet said it's okay do all these it he didn't say that he was emphasizing the way that the word is used in that definition at that point right so we'll get back to those sign but see look it's supposed to be taking upon ourselves the divine nature of God now there is the only strength or our virtue that is worth anything is the divine nature of Almighty God nature our virtue the divine nature our divine nature and you know virtue the things of God he expects us to add these things but we can't do it ain't nobody said anything about what we can do and don't do but if we won't make ourself available he can't do it he can't save you if you don't want to be saved well no he can boy he dr. Paul no don't go those routes he can't save you if you don't want to be saved the probably said he can't override your free moral agency all right no she expects us to have these virtues so it must be that he has provided away and he did which is the prophets message right the Word of God so that others can see his nature in us that's what the strength from virtual you'll find to be more and more is that you can look at something or somebody he said how would it be if you're out here telling somebody that you're a Christian he said in drunk the next day he said ain't no virtue to that this it's for taking of his divine nature but letting that nature live to outwardly into our hearts and lives see it's his nature the probably said to be like Jesus was the greatest song he'd ever heard well what was he wanting to be like Jesus oh he went out and raised it at healed assigment is that all you can see of the life of Jesus yup and he was God he was tempted in more than you and I could ever think about being tempted so don't set him aside and try to make it to be something that that he wasn't empty no he was tempted worse than we are that's what we should consider did not listen so do you see what I'm talking and driving add to your faith what God gave you the new birth right all right he gave it to you it belongs to you okay he ain't gonna take it back right he's not an Indian giver so he's not gonna take that back from them it belongs to you then if he says now add virtue strengths and you know know whatever willing to make them he's got to make away and he did by giving us the word what you see instead of us trying to to take it and study of the things that said we're trying to make it something that it's not see the new birth is the nature of Almighty God which I believe it is we have always tried to teach it to you because that's what I believe it I believe the new birth is the birth of the word now if you can express anything else that's an uber to be then the birth of the word I'd like to know about it and I'll give you the full pitch you can have it to explain it what you see the birth of the word is to bring the very nature remember what Jesus said to Nicodemus he said you must be born again the original says you must be born from above in other words Jesus was telling Nicodemus if you could ever come to the place to be born from where I come from then you will know what I'm talking about right the new birth see we are supposed to be partakers of his divine nature which is the partakers of the word right see I can't do anything myself but I can accept what he's done for me and then I can try to make myself available it's not go out and live like the devil and then said well I'm a Christian we were talking about that coming home last night kind of you know in our thoughts a lot of times we we we get it all messed up now listen if the new birth is the birth of the word the word revealed to you are made alive the disciples took the word they held the word the Holy Ghost came and quickened the word giving them the new birth right that's the same thing that happens to you and I we study the Word of God we hear the preaching we do and God comes to us accepting our believing because we've accepted him then he comes and accepts our believing of him and gives us his own very nature faith you don't give you something that it's not worth anything he gives you the very foundation of all Christianity his faith in the Word of God and then when he gives that to us then he's expecting us to add these like well how can we add him all right the Prophet made it that's read I want you to listen to what he's saying he said you can't a nice rubber and metal you can't do that sorry I can do this all right do that cuz I'm Christian I know I'm born again they don't bother me to drink smoke dude no no I don't bother cuz you're not born again who are you telling me any born again yeah yeah anything else does that answer the question I didn't stumble when I said it if we live like the devil are we do you think you live a good Christian life no sure don't did you see it ain't up to us to live a Christian life it's up to us to let him come in to us and let him live outwardly that's his divine nature that's the Christian life all right did the entire pyramid now watch them say if the new birth is the foundation of the Word of God then the end time period would be the birth of the word that's sensible code it's the same material right now wouldn't it be good Tony do we go out boy we pour that foundation we put 12 inches well let's put 14 let's do this and do that and then we go down and buy the cheapest two before as we can buy to start from there or some kind of a material that ain't worth nothing and then we start building a house know whatever we put on the second stage to lay on the foundation should be as strong well you know it's supposed to be 16 centers so we'll make it 40 inch center that won't matter I won't matter a little swag fall down it won't matter and that's what we do in our Christian life to letting him do it how do we add these virtues by the word that is revealed to us the Bible says study to show that self approve workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth see then the word that is revealed to us is the way God brings to us his nature because the new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ right all right what would be the rest of the pyramid would be the birth of the word that's why I love it anyway cause you're birthed into this see your birth into this you burst into this person this person will have any burst we have I don't know but I love it in the scripture were during the book of Acts they had many feelings of the Holy Ghost don't you have many feelings every time they gathered they had many feelings of the Holy Ghost and then a new birth to have that one but what does it matter if we have many births what's the problem so I'm birthing to this person to this person the Prophet says no son the opening of the word is the is the birth why is it then the scripture says being born again these are studying of God's Word will bring the nature of God because he can quicken it but if we don't know what the prophets say let's see he said the Holy Ghost is sitting in your soul waiting on you to bring in the word now perforation I'm hitting pretty close but he said now as quick as you bring it in said he'll make it live where's he yet these words he yet he's inside your soul that's your faith that's your foundation that's where he's living at he's waiting on you to bring in the word he's waiting on you to study the word and and to get to that but it's not just had knowledge of how much we can read now we'll get to those things it's the revealed word he realized then the key to the whole thing is what you know I said I'd get around to speaking on eventually because I did I ask brother motor I said now how did we get these virtues he said well I don't rightly know I said I don't either I went throwing off on the my what the Lord spoke to me about 19 and 80 and he was showing me the the opening of the word through the seals and they're different things and and he showed me the key what is the key to be able to add the virtues number one we know we can't have him okay solve the problem we drew that don't thank Sealy we can't do it but he can do it but we got to make itself available well I don't need to study that seal book probably preach didn't it'll be that that for what does it matter to me well I thought it was the plan of redemption I mean I'm sorry that's that's the way I think I thought the seals was the plan of redemption I thought the seals revealed things about Redemption that were not made known to mankind until the coming of the end time and the Prophet coming to bring the word I mean if I've missed that I'm sorry that's just where I stands what always believed God had it available with who could he get to deliver it to your name let's see we get hung up in the vessel instead of the delivery instead of believing the word that has been brought that it will take care of our needs we get hung up on the vessel that was brought by and stopped with a hat well you know I mean if that's offensive to anybody I'm sorry but is it true so how do you get anything all right now Josh where's the enemy he doesn't disappear by courage and turned into then he groped hard on anything now anybody run the ball then brother Bob he's a he's on some way in the computer tech that's what I tell him around here we got a whole bunch of computer techs now I don't know what that means I just heard that word that's he call him computer techs they supposed to know something about a computer huh no no brother Bob how did you get where you at and what you doing well I just I just got it I just walked in one day they did fail how about it brother long years of studying right long years of practicing long years of failing right they came up to algebra in our day I told him I said you're wrong I said because that don't work they said well algebra what is that it said well it's a new world it's a new thing of doing well what do we need that far well it's because we're gonna have to have it one day to go to the moon well I was an interesting going to the moon then I mean interesting going the moon now I wanna do what the Prophet said I want to pass the moon supplies until all right they kept telling me you know and they've called it that power Squire you know 3.14 worthless to show yeah I do know a little bit okay it's a little bit over 3.14 - no one's going alright we'll see they called it power square I told them in I said uh-uh I tried to tell the kids as you go tell that schoolteachers ain't right PI's not squirt pots right on cornbread squirt well you said in your sippy no I'll just illustrating how dumb we all are okay now brother Bob's gonna gonna sit here today and I'm going to explain or Aaron back there will get with him I'm honored to explain these magic numbers or whatever you call them imaginary numbers and we're going we're gonna get us a lesson this afternoon and imaginary numbers I don't need no lesson to imagine their numbers I got problem with the numbers I don't need no imaginary and I'm not making a joke I'm just making illustration how do you get where you're out well I just walked in dinner and told him I need a job they said well what can you do I don't know but I need a job well can you count what a lot take my shoes I'll get that far well we need somebody you know I mean they pay them outstanding amounts of money today for people to know how's it taking those numbers and put it together come out with right answer right well what about in the Christian room now how can we get Donnie he's a mechanic well now Donnie's going to explain to Bob on mechanic and Bob's gonna tell us all about it with a computer well we just get all messed up right what is the way it's to study it study it to be able to say and you know ain't it so amazing and I look at it like this and thinking about the human mind and how smart we think we are but you know what Bob cannot doing anything in the computer room unless he's knows one plus one equals two Donnie can't fix a car unless he knows one plus one equals two they used to make so much fun of me cause I was in the DOS end of the deal coming up and I never did care about the windows you know and I was a dass man still do it but you know what I didn't know enough sense to know one thing you know your windows is sitting over my dass my daus is still controlling das is the first level of mechanical parts you would call it of computer ISM I guess would be the way to say it you know you can't do away with it you can't do away with it because it's the way to get there how do we get there by prior and studying is that the way you profit said do we get the Word of God prior and studying studying the Word of God studying the Bible study the prophets message see we've got the prophets message the Word of God to tell us all things and the Prophet wouldn't he say within these books and tapes lives the change of the body we'd call it justice verbatim of words and we're going to study Greer's Almanac we're going to study this we're gonna study that ain't got time to to read ain't got time to study the message well you know what we're gonna get exactly what we're gonna know we're gonna still be with the DOS and everybody else gonna be going with the windows cause it's the same simple thing that's why I told a man let's eat that you know brought me into it and everything the kids tried to get me into the computer point of it this is the point but see I was on the das I could work it and do what I wanted and the man kept home and he laughed at me the one that showed me what to do or sold it to me he said you still own that I see up still on it he says what are you going to get out of them back on days I said when you put it to her that I could type in God is good and it immediately appears I said I will go to Windows he said type it in typed it in it said God is good which I was used to typing it in God is good on my docks go cut the Grice picked it you know get the garden and and do all the work and then finally come back in and there it was it's just a little slow but you know heart they come to some place right well when he chopped a tea and I said I'll go home we're going with with the windows because he I had a reason to know things had speeded up I was in the computer industry but in a world but not what I needed to be all right now what's the point if the new birth is the foundation of all Christianity and if the new birth is what Jesus said upon this I'll build my rock my church on that rock if that's true then we may need to speed up our capacity but don't forget your foundation what would happen if windows went flat you'd go back to gosh but how many could handle it no you'd have to go back to teach the whole thing over again but see that's what we're doing with the Word of God we're not studying the Word of God to try to find we're trying to find secret things would you live in to do in the walk dad out there the congregation want it they'll be glad to hear that yesterday they had never seen that before well that's not the way that I do I do to try to get me and you to understand the Word of God because I believe the new birth is the birth of the word anything after that will be the birth of the word it's all right what am i doing then what do you mean I don't need a new birth I got new birth well brother they'll try to get them and people try to get a new birth while we weren't wearing born again forty fifty years may I quote Paul have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe have you grown up and got out of Dodge got over into Windows do you understand where we're at so God has supplied now that's the emphasis I've always tried to make God gave the Prophet the word that was the purpose he was to bring the word that was another cough or that he was to bring those things turn the hearts and the back of Anita all of that was in the word but we didn't know it but one day we learned that all right now it's wonderful to keep on reading the message that 50 years later we're still kidding from that message revelation enjoined reading and going studying the message enjoy hearing the Prophet sees a way to get the virtues is to do one thing how did you get to birth okay how did you get the new bar I accepted Jesus Christ as my savior and then he accepted me and gave me the baptism home to go uh-huh he had the Holy Ghost available all you had to do is accept it are the virtues and things of what we have need of is available all we need to do is study the prophets message and to see that as we do there's no set channel to be able to say we need the virtue so let's stand let's handle it this way let's do that and let's do over here we're gonna we're gonna jump over here we don't need to know all this about faith and first let's jump up here to godliness I think what I'll be better human beings we're great great that's good we ought to be whether we're gonna forget all the other you've left your foundation see what I'm trying to get you to see is the revealed Word of God is the only thing that bring you to a birth a revealed Word of God is the only thing that can bring you up and me up the Statue of a perfect man the Prophet brought the word we're not listening we're not looking for some channel or some thought we have it it's already there the prophets message is dire so let's study that part because that was what God spoke to me about is the opening of the word I've always loved the Bible I've always loved the Word of God but it started opening now here's our problem we need verses so let's look up into Bible devil scripts we can find on virtue there's you know there's more scriptures in our so then beside the one bird around amuse they're speaking of virtue of strength well let's just study these let's get somebody to explain all this about how you do this then it's not that have you ever been sitting seriously no think because I'm trying to explain a very valuable point I don't mean mind wandering the word that we're sitting I remember when you don't know what's going on and you know I look at some of you sometimes I thank my lord you know you just you over here and over there you know what is on their mind but listen it will do us no good to bring up a reading room situation you know you don't want to mean by that not throwing off on them that's what you have a witness point reading they have a reading them they're going to read and they teach them how to talk to you and what you say they say something back and they got all kinds of things all right no it's not training us into those things it's a yielding of our vessel to God and what I mean now you listen to what I mean in what I'm saying it's not you sitting there that your mind is gone and you you're not even thinking about something all that once whammo here goes something with no that not exactly the way it is that ain't gonna work that way but when you're thinking on the Word of God and somebody's speaking if you ever done this you're engulfed in your thinking about the Scriptures you you've got something in your mind that you're thinking of and the minister or somebody talking to us or something says something that goes you know just pull off with us what you're doing and then now you've changed from this thought that you're engulfed in to now you're into a different line a different thought what has happened God is speaking to you is that sensible I'm trying to tell you something if you listen it's not to try to find how many times the word virtue is in the Bible and be able to say it's in our 49 times in sin River no that's no one here but find out about the life of Jesus Christ how did he wind up with the strength that the woman could draw from and how could she see it in him well he was no here's what we're gonna get into her oh he lives such a good life you won't stay the rest of the afternoon you want to get into where he planted ropes together and run him out of the temple you want to get in where he called him first issue snakes and he didn't put everything down as a flowery bed of ease a bunch of roses nor anything did he he didn't sugar hid everything he was playing but from that what about telling a man like Nicodemus said Nicodemus you are a teacher he credited and gave it to him but he said you don't even know these things he wouldn't brag it on him too good he was telling we're not worried I he was telling that it's trouble then he was dependent on the wrong time I'm trying to get this point in then what we're all right think on it you're setting you're listening you're studying you're meditating you're reading and all that once your mind goes into another thought room another pattern something is revealed to you and you say well I wasn't even thinking about that I wasn't even thinking on that that form and see God is speaking to you that's where you're getting the things there's where the opening of the word is coming in out you remember when the prophet begin to talk oh well how much we remember the days when we first started you know then to hear that prophet explaining said one God is simple he said I'm a father I'm a human I'm a being he said got many manifestations but said there's only one God and your mind goes through the whole Bible this as it begins to open and you see who talk IV Brown you see who talked to Moses you see it was the same I'm the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob knowing that ever one of those was a manifestation of God in an hour at a time but yet every one of them was the same God through the opening of the word he will bring into being the nature that he wants within you and I is that simple to study the Word of God to listen to tapes and pray and ask God to reveal themselves see that's the way the virtues will come the virtues will come because of the revealing of the work now listen DARS where it's going to hurt because you're not studying the message you're studying everything else am I wrong only through the opening of the word can we be brought to anything how do we get the virtues well I sneeze virtue outer skin or I need knowledge I'll just study the Bible that's not going to give you knowledge of God or what he's talking about it's when you come to little situations and learn read what that prophet said that's what opens it to me when that prophet said said look at that he said Abraham had knowledge and I thought Abraham that knowledge wait a minute Abraham wasn't born again well yet God enjoyed the thought to meditate with Abraham in his thoughts and that's what I love about it that Abraham is called a father of faith why because God could talk to him well how do we get knowledge how do we get temperance well we just would just not have and we'll we'll beat the daylights out of everybody until they get to where that's that they're acting more nicer that's not gonna change nothing cuz that's not what it's talking about only through the opening of God's Word can the virtues be brought into being into the hearts and lives of the people that and only that is the only way it can come he said well what's been wrong because we're not reading right so we try to hear somebody preach some outlandish off-the-wall doctrinal idea than to sit down and just talk about the word I enjoyed that cuz they got into a big argument boy boy he was telling him off on this side and he was on that side he was boy I would having a big well where do you go get in the middle of the five cuz there's what you won't you try to find the Word of God look it away or reveal read the Bible and let it just become part of you not because you've read it but because you can see that it's speaking to you come on the Prophet said virtue he said that's not living a virgin life so he goes over to the strength because that's what it is but what is strength it was the man himself being made manifest what are these virtues Christ's own life living in us that it see we study the word which to me now is this me saying the Bible the prophets message because they are the Word of God revealed we have the Bible we have the prophets message that tells us the Bible is right not correcting it not changing it telling us what it's saying related to her Ives now see then by the Word of God being revealed then God can add his nature through the revealing of the word that's what I'm talking about I give it about two minutes we'll quit revealing his nature through the opening of his word and seeing those individuals in the word and see how that they were living for God in a time when they didn't even have did not have the new birds it was not there but yet Abraham was a friend of God it was it Abraham said I know he'll teach his children which one was one of them I know I know he'll teach his children yet confidence God had confidence you know my hand does he have that in you and I d then it's all the birth of the word didn't I listen let's get over onto this part these are message the prophet has brought us is the Bible brought in to not not interpreting it not changing it not doing those things but he's saying it's meaning what it says and says what it means you know it's right he's bringing us the clarity of the fact of how right it is that we thought we had to interpret it some way to get some mystery out of it I've heard preachers more they try to make something they're bringing it so great of a mystery and a lot of them Oh brain like this I got something right here I'm gonna tell you everyone I'm gonna tell you in a while but they never get over that I want to walk down open the book say come on tell me what you got well are they trying to entertain me or what are they trying to do huh so now listen I'm gonna bring this for your closing and we'll cover the virtues later see what I'm talking about not just to read the Bible the Word of God the message listen to tapes and things but it's when the word is revealed or made alive in us it will bring into our being the divine nature of Almighty God only by the Revere word now why don't you want the seals why don't you want Daniel 7u8 could it be that we're turning down the channel could it be today that we're turning down the channel that would come forth because hey I I'm gonna read it I want this make the statement cuz I got it in here in Ephesians forward talks about the fivefold ministry being for the perfecting of the science brother branham put it in the message the statue of perfect man to fill him up that I make teach others a possible problem now listen I'm gonna make this statement of you like it now I'm sure you where God put that in the word now you show me where he took it out you show me where he took the fivefold ministry out of the word well if it is that the fivefold ministry is far the perfecting of the science then could we be turning down the channel that God is using that's as simple as I'm asking you that I'm gonna finish with this title okay listen then the virtues are to be added to your faith in your faith is the warning and experience your born-again experience is the new birth within your soul you go with me your faith your birth and all is to be dealing with the soul it's not the body and spirit God uses that and works through it but it's got to be the soul of the individual now then if he adds the virtues and he's in dire as I quoted while ago at the Prophet cities and they're waiting on you to bring him the word and said he'll make it alive alright to add to your virtues why would we be afraid to listen to preachers preach on some doctrine and ideas and things even if if they're just trying to straighten something out we can learn from that but listen it's added to the soul because that's where the new birth starts from alright now listen how did that woman see or know from Jesus that she needed the strength he had it was not an automatic process it was over a time element of her watching what he was doing and may have been you know who's right already healed a bunch of people and she saw that or whatever it is you want to put all that together you do that I'm just trying to preach and see that woman she saw something something that made her think and she says that's for me she dropped from him what she needed see God adds the word to word until we come out with the nature of Almighty God is that just actual perfect ma'am is that they don't listen just a simple thought see we're born again in or so we're not born again in our body and spirit okay now listen for a second huh so being born again in our soul that's where we begin to work from and that's what all connecting what what's your body and spirit is involved in it because remember the only way people can see God is not through your soul because they can't see yourself right well they see the Menten dollars they see it through your spirit they see what your spirit is doing your spirit is manifesting what's in your soul and see that's why we need that spirit to operate from the inside come in back out right now listen to what I'm saying then get it right so what is in my soul will come out in my spirit because you cannot see my soul other than follow me into the spirit room and that's where the deception is that because people can be Christians and spirit now how do you gonna know whether they're Christians in spirits or so by the word right then what did the Prophet say how do you test anybody he said give them the word test become the word test that's what I'm doing today I'm giving the word test every one of us let's see if we pass it because you see then I don't have any trouble with you know thinking about what we do or don't do I know preachers that's their basic doctrines and ideas is they have to preach on own clothes and dress and higher and stuff like that and maybe I need to preach a whole lot more on that but if you're a Christian don't tell me you're gonna cut your heart don't tell me you're gonna work plants don't tell me and you're gonna go out and do this or do that we're gonna be on dad they don't even talk about that don't even mention that stuff to me because it has no sense to it the Bible tells us not to do things why should we worry well I didn't know that to the Prophet see you didn't go to church where it was taught right okay the Bible didn't change the Prophet brought not a great revelation to us about hair and dress and clothes it was already in the world he just emphasized it he put it to wear you you had to think about it he put it to her and saying if you do these things you're not a Christian now you stop and see at least your thinking and my Christian do I live like one glad like one am i turning down the revealed work am i turning down the revealed work am i rejecting the word of God because it doesn't fit my idea or thought come on musician what about it we have had the most wonderful opportunity you not have it if we have a question all we got to do is go to the prophets message about the answer to all things is laying in the Word of God yeah but we don't want it knocked out or the we're trying to make excuses study the word you say how do we get these virtuous brother Dale I still ain't got that right how do we get them by God revealing his word but if we turn down the channel that he sends it by if we reject the way he sends it then we're rejecting them but see we don't take it to know what we just take you to what I believe well okay we've been around in 50 years on what I believe we need 50 more oh god we were laughing about that over there yesterday about how there's a gap up here it's like 75 to 80 and then there's a space in between there and then we drop down to the fifties and the sixties and then their space and then you drop down to the 30s and the 40's and we got perfectly in line the Bible we got the old hands that's all Moses we got the ones they died in the wilderness we got the young ones to go over see we've got it laying out right before us the very hour that we're living think on these time well brother than what I need to do to get virtue then read the Bible study the message how else do you think you're gonna get it we've got it laying in her hands what do we need come on let Stan think on these things before we get over sing that song he touched me oh I was sure I'd ever need faith in the
