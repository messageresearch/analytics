========================================

I'm going to teach a little lesson here this morning continuing where he left off last time but I want to kind of focus on love this morning and I just like to stay right in there with what's being taught to us you know brother Waits uh teaching the statue perfect man and I just want to stay right on that study because I don't want to get everybody distracted with other topics and things and also brother Bob's been on the subject of faith so my key focus is I love to love and I hate to Hate that's I'm all about love I love to love people and when it comes down to where I have a choice when I face adversity with someone I try to overlook that you take make a lot of examples like road rage you know you think well I could I could rage back a little bit when somebody does something to me on the road but you know otherwise I could say well I don't think they meant to do that I can Overlook that maybe that was an oversight they didn't mean to do that and just try to be forgiving and loving the people and I just that's the way I love to be just take an attitude of love and just as a choice you can choose to love or you can choose to be hateful toward people it's a choice we have when it comes to loving our other people and Brothers and Sisters in Christ especially um the bride I believe should be experts on the subject of love I don't claim to be an expert on it I'm a student I'm a student on the word of God I'm a student on everything I do I'm a student truck driver I'm a student pilot I'm a student parent and student father I'm trying to constantly better myself and and pray and ask the Lord to help me to be better at all that I do so I'm not claiming to be an expert on this but I just want to bring out some things that I hope will be supportive and helpful in the subject you notice I put there part one because I'm sure I won't finish today so maybe we'll have a continuation of this later I'm going to go and open in prayer just for the lesson here Heavenly follower Pride you just bless us as we study on the subject of love and help us just to understand a little bit more about you and your love especially the agape love that we need to know so much about Lord is brother Wade stands here ministering to us on that Lord help us to just open our hearts and open our minds to receive that and more understanding and a field of Love Too Lord we just want to know all about you and that great love that you've made for us and we give you the glory for it and thank you in Jesus name amen so just to review the last lesson um I was talking about the Statue of perfect man and all these virtues and the life of the Lord himself it's not hard to study in his life and see on display all these virtues uh really um as you notice there that top left picture him as a boy with the doctors that I think scripture calls them doctors that means just like basically the teachers He was discussing the word with them at a very young age and asking them questions he was all about the father's business from a very young age and then there's those silent years when uh he comes to this 29 and a half becoming 30 the Bible says he comes to be baptized and be anointed for his ministry there was a growth development in that silent year period and he was evidently reading the Scrolls going to the temple the Bible says that was his custom you know to go to the to the synagogue and on the Sabbath into and just and to read the word of God so we know during those years there was some growth development he was growing in Grace and knowledge and then he came to the stage where he had all these virtues on display in his life and it's like I said it's not hard to see that I'm going to try to go a little bit slower today because I know I'm gonna finish all of it so I'm going to try to slow down a notch so he was all about the father's business uh and then as you see he comes to the end of his life especially there on Calvary that was the embodiment of this what we're talking about love that's agape love such a strong display of it that he was there on Calvary and being mocked and his beard being torn out and he's being spit on and ridiculed and all and and being laid there open and naked and bare and shame for us and that he still displayed all this love even for the ones who were mocking him he was dying for the sins of the world what a display of agape love it couldn't couldn't possibly be a greater display of love than that so what I want to say is I'm back up here before I get to that I like to look for examples okay um and I know that these things were on display in the life of our Lord and they should certainly be on display in the bride but you're not going to see Billboards you're not going to see big flashy signs you know God is in the little things that's why I loved like sister Rebecca durrette's testimonies in sister Beverly they talk about they testify about God and the little things in their lives and don't overlook those little things because God's in all those little things now look at the virtues in your life and in the lives of others in the bride of Christ and you can see these things on display I want to give some examples um just some little things I've noticed you're gonna think Ryan that's not really virtue that's not really godliness well yeah yeah it is if you really think about it it's on display it's in full View and it should be it's not a far off it's not across the sea of the word of God is neither in my mouth and in my heart and it's manifesting it's a Living Word manifesting his attributes these virtues of the stature perfect man so it's here okay just be attentive and focus on what is going on around us in your life and in the life of other people okay um I came here from the Baptist Church at 17 and immediately I noticed a huge difference okay not condemning them in the Baptist Church they don't know any better about the ladies some of them you know where they would wear makeup and cut their hair and wear pant suits and even shorts and t-shirts men and women both just kind of you know not really dressing holy and living holy in that way because they didn't know any better but I came here and I noticed the first thing you Godly sisters the way you dressed I said man that's I already had in mind what I wanted to marry that God had dealt with me about you know when I get married someday I should look for a girl that would be willing to put Christ in marriage that was my my ambition because the youth pastor at the Baptist Church told me that look for someone who would read the Bible and prayer with you and go to church with you and you too would love the Lord together serve the Lord together put Christ in marriage and then I came here and I said wow I need to do that but also I need to look for one of those Godly saintly holy dressed Christian ladies Holy Ghost filled with the long dresses and you know not clingy form-fitting clothes and no blouses and things like that nothing provocative because being a boy at that age 17 a lot of hormones I didn't like to be around people that would be a source for Temptation for me okay so you sisters were the reason and I chose to marry Gabby I would look at the lives of life's sister June for example I could name a lot of names here I had a lot of people in mind and I said God give me another June give me another Peggy Dell another Lisa Dell another Anna all the Anna's we've got lots of Anna's but so many examples here that I said God I want one of those wholly dressed and and that's the way Gabby was when I met her but that was an example to me of all this godliness that's godliness where the white spent sermons many sermons talking about that godliness is already here we already have godliness and sometimes we take it for granted we don't realize we're already living Godly lives if you compare us to the world it's easy to see we chose to name our fourth child Abba um when Gabby had conceived her I remember praying with her one night and I said well I I opened my eyes from the parent I said I believe I we want I want to name her June her middle name June not just after sister June that she's a special lady to me to Gabby to many people here because she's so kind and loving and all that she's a very special lady and that's why I chose that her and brother Wade like my message to parents that I didn't have because I didn't my parents didn't come in the message but aside from that it's representative of all you sisters because I knew through that what to look for in a wife through y'all's example of godliness I knew through that that's why I chose Gabby Now look for example brother the kindness charity and selflessness that's a big part of all this we're talking about love selfless brother the way you've been on the subject of selflessness that's a hard thing okay remember that God hides himself and reveals himself in simplicity one of the main examples I'm going to give here is uh for many years I've gone back and reminisced over mining Gabby's wedding day and I looked at the pictures of her but I didn't really notice in the background I mentioned this certain young lady last time when I taught my lesson about these Dutch perfect man and I remember that this certain young lady was uh kind of she liked me okay just being blunt I met a certain girl Kentucky girl in 2005. I met her at the Alabama Camp she liked me but I didn't like her that way I wanted to be friends well she continued like me and it wound up it's just one of them hard things as a teenager we all go through that where you like someone but they don't like you back and that's hard but she's over it she's happily married now Godly Christian man she married they have a beautiful family but I never had noticed until 15 years later I looked back the other day at this picture and I saw in the background this certain young girl and what you notice her doing there is a display of Brotherly sisterly kindness despite that she liked me and wanted to marry me she was going to let me marry Gabby and stay back out of the way and and actually help Gabby on her wedding day to prevent a possible embarrassment that Runner that goes down the aisle her dress that got snagged on that and she was going to walk down the aisle dragging that thing behind her possibly and embarrass herself you know that's a real display of Brotherly kindness as little as that looks yet think about what was going on in her mind that she wanted to marry me and yet here's this other girl brother Branham said when you love someone right you could let them marry someone else and you just step yourself up by the wayside and said I'd rather you be happy you know that was a display of that that was the display brother sisterly kindness she just stepped all the way and said I'm actually going to help Gabby have a good wedding and a good life and go on and I'm going to get out of the way selfless so selfless Godly little girl so brother Dale is another example think of our pastor brother Dale stood Faithfully for many years ministering the word of God for our benefit and our other ministers have done likewise how many times have we heard brother Dale stand up here and say I would that I would be happy to see y'all make it in the Rapture and me just go by the wayside me just stand off and be happy to know that I had some something to do with it but yet you all make it and if I don't even make it he would say I'll be happy just to see y'all make it what selflessness and to set himself aside and stay and pray for for us not for his benefit I know ministers do benefit from it too but you know they're doing it for us they're stepping aside of all the fun they could have they go out and instead of going out and having fun on the weekends they sit and study and pray and see God for a sermon or whatever or a lesson and that's selflessness that's them that's godliness and kindness and brotherly kindness you know on display uh no she doesn't want me to mention this probably but a couple Sundays ago sister Regina had a little birthday party for me and my family got us a cake came back there in our little room we're not in we're not out here in the main room where everybody was seeing that so she wasn't doing it to be noticed she wasn't doing it for notoriety or recognition but now she's getting it is it for Regina she came in there and had a birthday party for me and my family got us a cake and cards and all that and she came in there and she just wish sung us happy birthday just to celebrate us and I was like Wow brotherly kindness totally selfless not thinking of her own self I gotta make a distinction here too right up front um I want to say that I'm comparing back and forth during this lesson on uh agape love and Philo love but make the distinction that they are very separate agape love is very infinitely higher than filial love okay it's so much higher but yet I guess it'd be okay as I said to say I'm a student so I'm going to word it this way that maybe you should say God let that condescend that great agape love kindness into a form of philia where we could begin to understand something about agape love because how it's cool we understand something so great so Luke 14 If any man coming to me hate not his father and mother and wife children and Brethren and sisters and even his own life he cannot be my disciple the Lord telling us to hate our brother and sister something don't sound right go down to that other uh big print verse 33 so likewise whosoever he be of you the forsaketh not all that he hath he cannot be my disciple so he's kind of clarifying what he said there at the top at the beginning of that verse hate is if you look at the definition there Strong's definition at the bottom it's in bold print he means love less so our love for God should be infinitely higher than our love for spouse children friends family and even one another it should be so much higher that it's as if it were hate okay big big difference likewise there's a big difference between agape and filial love so I don't want to come across like I'm saying they're wanting the same they're definitely not but uh let's see for some reason the highlights didn't show up on here so I don't know which part I'm supposed to read but anyway Ephesians 5 why submit yourselves to your husband as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church so you see here Paul making the comparison of marriage and filio love marriage love as a comparison to Christ in the church that's kind of what I'm doing here back and forth several times through here husbands of your wife even as Christ I love the church so he's making that comparison philio and Agape we can understand a little bit more about agape just by our natural relationships between husband and wife parents and children and brother and sister in Christ and just friends and with people you can kind of begin to see the in a much lesser form this great Agape Love on display because Agape Love is a great thing and it's really infinitely beyond our understanding if God doesn't bring it down somehow to where we can grip it or we can kind of have a tangible example of it here so skip a numbers 29 for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherished that even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body and flesh of his bone for this cause shall a man leave his father mother and shall cleave and shall be joined to his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church okay so faith and love two tremendous subjects I can't think of anything greater than faith and love to talk about and yet at the same time simultaneously our brother Wade brother Bob in Sunday school now talking about faith brother waveman is now talking about the status of man brother kindness and and love getting into this great two subject at the same time so it's a tremendous thing I mean it's a really a sacred Holy Ground we're standing on right now with them talking about these things simultaneously some we should really meditate on and with their backgrounds both being in uh brother Bob you think of Colossians 1 26 he loves that scripture and by the way it is real uh particular to Genesis 1 26 and 27 when you think about Genesis 1 26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness let them have to mean of the fish of the sea and of the foul of the air and over the cattle over all the Earth and over every creeping land of creepeth upon the Earth so God created man his own image image of God created him female created them that's our you could say our theophany that's our eternal life that was in God for the foundation of the world that he brought down to this Spirit man that we're coming back to it's what we bypassed but that's agape love and here is brother white talking about love standing here and uh and I'm sure he's going to be talking more about it as we go and brother Bob about this scripture calls from 126 and especially verse 27 to him God will make known what is the riches of the glory in this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory faith what great faith and brother Brown talked about I don't think I have to quote too much later I won't get to it today fall in love with the Lord first I've got a whole bunch of slides probably from the next lesson about first falling in love with the Lord the most important thing you can do really fall in love not just say I want to stay out of hell I'm just trying to dodge hell but no really fall in love with Lord first and then it'll start you in this baby form of love this baby form of faith of believing that'll just keep going and growing from Faith to Faith from Revelation to Revelation from love to love you'll be loving the Lord more all the time as you go through your journey about start off with love just giving a little depiction here I think that's how brother Wade said it the other day these first four okay virtue knowledge temperature patients are kind of all inward dealing with us you know individually and with our own self but then godliness is more upward and then I believe he quoted that uh brotherly kindness and love are outward that's the hard part that's toward our fellow man that's the part that's kind of hard to to get a hold of but it's it's attainable okay I'm not saying it's out of a reach again it's attainable we can get it and we even see it already on display so much just really be a attentive and watch around you faith is the greatest expression I can think of just for an example of how great the faith of Jesus Christ himself is would be the universe and creation I'll talk about that in a minute of course the love already said the greatest display of that was I believe Calvary I crossed with that for our sins this is a picture I think of the Andromeda galaxy I love to talk about space because I see in that God and His vastness and how vast and great creation is and What Faith Can Do with this man Jesus Christ that would speak his word first think it then he would speak it and then believe it makes his great word with his great faith this infinite uh on this boundless faith and will create a universe that we don't think about much how vast it really is the Andromeda galaxy is our close end neighbor 2.3 million light years away so if he was to go the speed of light for 2.3 million years you'd reach our neighbor Galaxy that's close in that's the closest one well anyway they think that our galaxy The Milky Way looks something like that they don't know because they can't send a probe out there it's too far to go out there it would take millions of years to get out there and look if he was to cross from one side of this galaxy of ours to the other they estimate it to be a hundred thousand light years across you'd have to go the speed of light for 100 000 years to get from one side to the other that's our galaxy that's not the universe that's our galaxy that's our little bit of Galaxy that's not even our solar system that's just our galaxy now you think about all the other galaxies out there and they can't find it into it and the god that made all that spoke it and believed it with his own faith tremendous faith and now he had to bring that Faith down to this simple form of childlike faith I'm not in here later I don't know if we get to it today I think it's on one of my next slides I'll hold that for a minute I don't know much about human anatomy I'm not an expert on this uh notice Ruth knows about this other nurses but human anatomy is a fascinating thing and I just think it's incredible to think about the human body the god that spoke his word and believed his word could create this complex very impressive machine of the human body and even one blood cell is not just a blob it's a complex machine within itself with all these little intricate little Parts you take any system of the body of the intestines the lungs the cardiovascular system the skeletal system anyhow it's just absolutely incredible and God spoke that he thought in his mind he spoke it and believed it and even said I want to be that he said I want to be part of that he's it's god making himself flesh but it's all this display of his faith and then here again we have this display of love my slides got out of order so a condescension of God brought connotation of his attributes okay Matthew 18 at the same time came the disciples unto Jesus saying who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and Jesus called little child unto him not one of the doctors not one of the Pharisees he called a little child and set him in the midst of them and he said verily outstand to you except you be converted and become as a little child ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same as the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven you know a child just believes what they're told they don't have any reason really to doubt you they don't I mean they just they don't worry you know uh sister and brother Chris and sister Jesse's they got those three little girls they don't get up every morning and wonder how I'm gonna have a meal today I wonder if we want to have somewhere to sleep tonight no they just believe they just don't worry they have all this great love and this great childlike faith that they just love Mommy and Daddy they have confidence in Mommy and Daddy and they believe Mommy and Daddy and they trust mommy and daddy and that's how we approach our dad our heavenly father with that great love and faith it's just simple childlike love and faith part of our daily devotion times the Lord should include meditation on him and his worth he's revealed to us meditation on his word coupled with prayer and singing praises to Him will cause us to fall more in love with him now I'm going to try to talk a little bit about this um as just for a minute as we kind of transition this other side and I've been to onagape all right change your gears getting on the field of love you know if you have agape love if you have the love of God in your heart it kind of spills over into other areas of your life and in your marriage and in your love with your children and it's sort of you're a student of this great god of love you're a student of his and you're learning love and and as a way you can you know spend time with God and and love him more and more as you go on your journey likewise with your spouse it's also an effective method in marriage think about your spouse sometimes you stay while singing you don't have to do the love songs okay I know some people may not want to sing Love Song but think about your wedding song think about main thing is just meditate and think about the good things the good qualities of your spouse and that enhances Your Love You musicians can go ahead and come please think about when the two of you first fell in love your first date your first meeting in life Etc never lose that first love you had never leave that sweetheart stage Bank of brother and sister Tatum I plan to mention that next time about brother sister Tatum and many other examples brother and sister Dale people have been sweethearts in their marriage for decades and set the example for us of how it's supposed to be done when you put Christ in marriage and really have real love for each other and that starts in kind of a seed form and just keeps growing because you work on it because you cultivate it because you think about the good qualities of your spouse and don't think about all those that last argument argument you had or how you're gonna you know when you get home from work that day how you're gonna you know set her straight or set him straight or whatever that's what brother Dale used to say something about that and he he'd think about something maybe all day get home and she's made him a banana pudding or something and kind of calmed things down a little bit changes the atmosphere so anyway that's all I want to say for now I'm gonna close with that God bless y'all thank you [Music]
