we got number 20. and it was brother Joel and and sister Esther and sister Joseph's sister Sharon cenart sister well they know who I'm talking about but we had we had a baptismal service so sister Sharon cenart was baptized yesterday out here and um she had told me and most of you know the story she told me a couple years ago even that she wanted to be baptized and then about a year ago man it really looked bad she I mean they sent her home to die if you'll know the the testimonial you'll hear from sister Ashton Brother Joseph that they give her up to die they just sent her own home and we just really I mean we were praying hard and the Lord brought her out of it and I mean brought her from a being bedridden with a catheter being immobile till we walked her right out here had to help her in but that's okay and we baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so God gave her an opportunity and I'm telling you folks don't miss yours don't miss yours but see God in your heart got in your heart so he made her body and that's what we're going to get into a little bit later he made her body obey what she wanted she was dying she was going to die I told her yesterday I said you're the best looking dead person I ever seen she just laughed also I was sitting home as I told Brother Joseph was sitting home last night and phone rang and it was a strange number and I looked at it and it said it said FaceTime so I clicked it it was Sharon I said what are you doing who's with you nobody I said you're doing this all by yourself uh-huh I said will you facing time me anytime you want to so y'all had trained her I guess how to use Esther's like I don't have a clue but but she was really tired she was in the bed but she was thinking Thanking us all for praying for her and for us being able to I told her it was an honor to baptize her it's not the other way around it's an honor for me to baptize people I just really um really enjoy it so just keep the keep her in your prayer as the Lord will continue he left her here for some reason so let's take that reason I told her yesterday I said look this is your day of visitation God's visited you you wanted this this was your desire so now go forward now let's do something all right and she's still you know got the stroke but but she can still she's got her mind she she knows what she's saying so so you know what God can deal with that amen God can deal with that so we're going to pray for him also uh brother Paul Thompson just sent me a message and his daughter Amber has coveted so remember her in prayer we got several that have covered I'm not worried about it you know it's just a Cletus 90 something years old and she can make it so can we Yeah man so we're just gonna keep her in prayer but and I know all of us have somebody we know that has coveted and um or or is sick and uh we really won't need to pray need to need to uh ask the Lord to intervene in all these situations so let's bow our head dear Lord thank you for this day that you give us we pray now Lord that you would help us just for uh small moment of time to get out of the way Lord and you speak your mind to the people Lord let it not be my thoughts but be yours Lord we pray Lord it should be with the ones that are not here the ones that are sick I know several watching online different ones Lord that are not feeling well different situations Lord I pray we should minister to each one father Lord we've come to a time that is getting closer to the end and we see things going on in the world but Lord you always said that there was a Goshen there was a place that the children of Israel could go to and they would be safe well father today your word is the only safe thing there is and Lord I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus that you would just be with us now as a congregation forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes that we make the Lord clear us out sanctify us be with us for the rest of this journey Lord just be with the ones that are traveling brother Louise Minister and their brother Williams and also brother Aaron and brother Andre heads Lord we pray that you just give them the words to speak to the people and may they get something Lord from the ministering father thank you for the ministry here thank you for the words that we hear Lord all the time the music musicians the singers all the song leaders all deacons elders and anyone that sits in a Pew today Lord we pray that you would energize us Lord that you would give us strength for this journey Lord in Jesus name we pray amen it's been a long one been a long journey listen to this quote I found yesterday thirsting for Life 1960 the prophet of God said if men and women love God as much as they the world loves their pleasures the pleasure of a Christian is serving the lord at the house of God we still am I in the right congregation we still believe brother Brown okay all right the pleasure of a Christian is serving the lord at the house of God you don't have to sign no cards you can't open the door quick enough and if the members of the church love one another enough instead of putting little clicks and pulling away from the church brother if you love one another so much that you hurt your heart till you get together again that's the way it should be blessed be the tie that binds our heart and Christian Love The Fellowship of Kindred Minds is light to that above well we Ascend when we when we as under part it gives us inward pain does it I don't want to say him again but we shall still be joined in heart and hope to meet again oh god look watch this if we have to take every miracle out of the church wow if we have to take every Miracle out of the church if we have to take all the pipe organs out and the plush pews and give us back that Godly love Brotherly Love among the people and fellowship if we have to do all that take it back to that again wow what a quote what a quote 1960 Thurston for God John 1 1 says in the beginning was the word words with God and the Word was God verse 14 said the word was made flesh and dwelt among us we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth he may be seated Lord add his Blessing to the reading the word this is part 53 on son of man it's it's um it's heading we're heading towards something I hope everybody sees that we it may take us 40 years but it somewhere we're going to get to the promised land amen it may take us a while it took us almost 40 weeks anyway so part number 50 something so let's go to first Thessalonians but today I want a background just for a few minutes um brother Daniel Perry and his wife's on their way here so I don't know if they got here already or not but just pray for them they come to uh they come to uh honor the anniversary of the of mom and dad so they're they're on the way furthermore then we beseech you brother and exhort you by the Lord Jesus that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and please God look so you would abound more and more so what we're preaching today what we've been trying to get people to see is is that there's more to God there's more to God than just raising your hand and say God I'm sorry or there's more than water baptism and there's more than coming to church it's it's it's it's it's all together the reason I read that quote is brother Brown says that desire in your heart to go not because if you don't show up I'm gonna write your name down and put it on a wall and says absent no you know what God's going to do that you know I'm gonna answer to me you're gonna answer to God I don't know why people don't see that uh well I just don't like you well I don't care you must not like God either for you know what Commandments we give you by the Lord Jesus for this is the will of God even your sanctification so God doesn't want you just to get born again he wants to continue he wants to make you and sanctify you and Die daily that's what we're going to look at a little bit maybe this afternoon with a tabernacle because the second see we looked at the first stage and I don't have it up there but we see the first stages baby form justification baby form sanctification baby form baptism of the Holy Ghost if you might say that is the birth of the child everybody with me all right and it's not so much different but it is different because you don't have to you don't have to ask forgiveness of the sin you did that you asked forgiveness for yesterday if you really got if you're sincere and God forgive you we waste a lot of our time going God I'm sorry for doing if it's already put in the sea of God forgetfulness like I said before put the no fishing sign up don't go back there anymore because God can't go back past that sign he said he's good amen so let's move on with god well I've got this if it's back there leave it that was the problem with the children of Israel that's why God had to let it go 40 years so all those old people old Fighters had to die out because they kept going every time some little situation would happen their cat would get sick they say oh it'd be better back in Egypt right oh we'd be better back eating leeks and garlic instead of this bread that was free that had every nutrient that you needed and they didn't want that no more it's the same way with us are we going forward because I believe Joshua and Caleb was they were pulling those people come on we got to go and Caleb stands up and says I'm more than able now to have that mountain I'm 80 now I was 40 when I started but I'm 80 now and you know what he did he did exactly what he said he took that mountain so God will what honor your request for this is the will of God even your sanctification that issues says excuse me you should abstain from fornication look that every one of you should know how to possess his possess his vessel in sanctification and honor I was thinking about yesterday you know when we talk about possession now each one of us we're possessed with something right don't get quiet we're possessed with something every person in this building all right now you either possess with God or possessed with the devil but even though if you're possessed by one of the two you have to be there's no in between all right then there's other things that are that possess you like I like to hunt all right I like to hunt and and uh brother Michael does not like to hunt so I'm possessed with I like to hunt he's possessed with I like to whatever his is all right and that's human that's human nature but it still is a nature that we have to deal with all right because look it says not in the lust of conscience even as the Gentiles which knew not God they didn't know God they didn't care but you and I do all right so every man possessed his vessel and sanctification and honor it's what we do with what we got all right so we've got the devil what are we going to do with it oh you know what you're going to do you're going to be possessed by that and you're going to do what the devil says then are you going to be possessed by God do what God says do like I said before can't wait till the church's doors get open can't wait to fellowship with people doesn't matter if if I can't say my words right doesn't matter if you can't say your words right doesn't matter if you sit in the back of the front we put a little lists together and we do that and we do it listen we do it unconsciously I don't like this preacher because what you just don't like them if they preach the word of God I really don't care what he looks like or what he sounds like amen how many of you heard brother Dale says even though he's he's listened to error he got something out of it how many of you don't know you'll shut it off buddy and well you shut off and go to sleep anyway so when the word's being preached so when you shut it off I'm not listening to that guy no you might get something you might get a nugget what am I I'm trying to train us as we start up this statue of perfect man I don't want anybody to fall off I want I want to make sure this Foundation of faith and by renewing of your mind as we're reading here and by what by possessing Your Vessel and sanctification and honor oh that's that preacher's fault I'm doing this no right no I'm like uh we were at camp meeting last weekend brother Donnie Reagan preached on chain to a dead man that's what would happen if a ruler would go into the a certain ruler would go into the City and take over the city well he'd kill half the people he'd leave other half alive and just to antagonize them or just to show his authority he would chain you that was alive to one that was dead now could you imagine dragging around a dead body and it starts thinking right but he also used this analogy which is wonderful because Paul was putting chains here was a Roman soldier that was assigned to Paul he was chained to him so Paul says Hey Roman I'm going to church that Roman's like I ain't going back over there you gotta go when Paul lifted his hands to praise God guess what that Roman had to lift his hands whether they wanted to or not and I'm looking at Romans here are you letting your Roman take over you that was the whole point we all have Romans we have Romans we have dead bodies we're dragging around chained to a dead man I enjoyed it it was good but think about that's what you do every day of your life you're chained to something Paul says I'm happy to be in my chains I'm happy to be in my bondage how many of you can say that that you're happy because the Bible is going to tell us in a little bit that the trying of your faith right the trying of your faith not God's faith not your neighbor's Faith your faith be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind listen we've got to come to a place that we are thinking like bride that we are thinking like the statue of a perfect man that we're thinking like Jesus Christ because we're we're are we going to renew our mind back to the world are we going to renew our mind back to carnality we live in that 90 of the time anyway but to renew your mind is to renew it back to where Jesus Christ can take over where the thoughts of Jesus Christ go into you and that you speak those thoughts be transformed so there's got to be something happens it's not just one day you wake up and you're born again no there's a journey to this that's what we've been on for 40 something sermons there's a journey to this thing there's everywhere you look look Abraham had a journey tight justification sanctification about them all goes 25 years he walked with the promise of God we can't stand 30 minutes of it so we got to renew our mind that you may prove what is that good that you may prove it's back in your lap now you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God listen you say I can't do it God said you could and then if God said it he's got to make a way as I've said many times before listen 99 troops not going to get a body change it's going to take a hundred well I can't do it because that first thing you said is your problem ah because the Bible says somebody's going to have to come to perfection in a body of Flesh that's dying looking older so we've got to have our mind renewed and it's got to be by the word of God on Sunday on Wednesday listen to tape praying reading your Bible talking to brothers and sisters about God not about each other can't be with somebody five minutes when I'm talking about somebody else for I say to the grace given unto me to every man look there's money you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as God has dealt to every man we've read this many many times but there's a Measure of Faith each one of us has to come to listen God knows God knows we don't but God knows what measure you're going to get to but you don't know and see to me that's the unfolding or the mystery that we all have in our life Abraham did not know when he first said okay Lord I'm going to get up and walk he did not know that it would be 25 years the prophet of God said he just believed he just kept believing and kept believing can't believe him if you would have told him at the beginning Regina it's gonna be 25 years Abraham he's going to go can't do it I'm done to start with no you got you gave when you get gifts then don't worry what the Bible says don't worry about tomorrow take care of itself you worry about today let's get through today the Bible says today is the day of our Salvation not tomorrow the next year 40 years down the road I mean have you how many of you older ones brother Colleen Brothers already if you were here today they'd tell you some of the older ones Dad and Mom would it be late 30 years ago we'd be here today they just said no way unbelievable can't happen then you had those people that were way back this in 1977 was going to be it were they at today most of them have passed on but God left it here for a reason we are here for a reason we're not here because God took a nap and forgot to punch the clock for the Rapture no he's been right here with us the whole time what in our journey molding us making us letting us go through trials and tribulations because the trying of our faith How You Gonna know if you got faith if you're not tried oh no I just got faith faith for what faith has got to be the substance of things hoped for something you think the evidence of Things Not Seen for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we be many are one body in Christ and everyone remembers one of another First Corinthians 13 verse 1 says do I speak with the tongue of men and angels and have not charity I have become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries this is a pretty good guy pretty good message preacher and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I can move a mountain and have not charity I am nothing and though I'll bestow all my goods to feed the poor do I give my body to be burned and I'm not charity it profiteth me nothing and that word love there is agape love it is brotherly love it's affection good will love benevolence it's God's love it is not man's love you can only agape love me if you have Agape Love In You you can only agape love me if I have agape love you can't understand what I've been reading the scripture you can't understand Jesus Christ without the Holy Ghost who is Jesus Christ that's a god they love what do you have if you're born again agape love and your soul the problem is is you've got that next realm that's got memory reasoning Consciousness oh one more affection affection oh we all love each other as long as they like my candy but don't eat it get your own no we love it when people are happy with us don't we but agape love somebody that hates your guts that's what brother kindness is that'll be up there for people hate your guts and you still love them the same way that's why all of our love is conditional God's love is not God's love is unconditional you say well what about all these do's and don'ts he's just telling you that's his mind that's what you're supposed to be doing if you have agape love you will turn toward that every time prophet of God said a holy ghost fail woman won't put on a pair of pants the Holy Ghost feel one won't cut her hair not because not cause she doesn't want to because somebody will see it it's because deep down inside that God pay lovers inside like Jim says if a man can hang on a cross if a man can go through for three and a half years what he went through it's nothing for me to wear my long hair it's nothing for me to to not put on a pair not put on apparel that looks like the world let's just say that because you say dresses and pants well apparel that looks like the world is fashion and we need to get away from fashion and have on modest apparel amen and we discussed that just make sure listen husbands you know you're going to give an account for your wife she's not gonna give an account for you right so if you look over and you see her dressed a little bit different a little bit James that several times she said hey just looked good I said no go put on something else all right but some of you wives would probably slap your husband and divorce him if he said them hello somebody that's being subjective to not the husband you're being subjected to the word of God if you're subjective to the word of God then the husband's just there as a vehicle to love you even with filio love but by agape love hey go put some under that because when you bend over I don't want nobody to see what I can see because you're mine God's jealous he don't want the world to see what he sees amen so the first stage we're going to talk about is we've been talking about before is the birth you've got to be born again so I want us to really realize all those who are baptized spitting everywhere today everywhere that we look we see being born again be born again are we birthed into the body do we have that agape love and I saw because remember I'm going to read just two quotes for brother Brown says you either have faith or either have doubt and your soul is one of the other there's not five senses now I'm gonna warn you this afternoon I'm going to read a quote where brother Bynum in pre-1960 when he called the soul the five Realms of memory region conscious and then inside the spirit now we've been taught for years by Brother Dale that now God he switched it though he switches Doctrine he switched his terminology because he always had a center realm with faith or doubt the next round five the next round five so let's keep it together this afternoon when we start talking about the Tabernacle in the wilderness all right because that's you you're the Tabernacle in the wilderness amen Romans 8 verse 14 for his minions are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of binds again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry have a father every one of us had to start as a baby we all started as babies naturally and we started as babies spiritually the whole issue is is you got to eat to grow you become the word as you eat the word you become the world as you eat the world y'all are really quiet this morning that's okay as long as you don't fall asleep which some of you already are but I can't help it folks if this don't excite you you need to go find something that does I mean ESPN will give you like 24 7 of nothing but Sports keep you awake the whole time you'll be doing this you know what it's a spirit that's anointing you brother Bob and I were talking a few minutes ago you know you got this you got one Camp over here that that you listen to this preacher and you say well we've got all the Dynamics we need the mechanics then you got these over here it says we've got the mechanics we need the Dynamics let's bring them together I agree anything that doesn't move is dead some of you are close but every once in a while a little amen would be just fine with me brother Donnie says could you allow nod a little louder please all right you know what it's not getting down in the soul all this other stuff is stopping it flus are being plugged up but get down let that Inside Man work its way out the spirit itself very witnessed with our spirit that we are the children of God now children of God Gonna Act Like children of God and if children then heirs Heirs of God now that heirs what's your air I'm going to show you right here that's it that's your that's your that's your uh uh heir of Christ that was Christ but look if so be that we what suffer with him that may be also glorified together listen this is not a picnic it's a battle every day when you put your feet on the ground there's a battle which one wins chief the one I feed the most and if Luis was here he'd be the one on Netflix the most he boy talks about Netflix he must have stock in it or something I don't know he'll hear this I'll tell him when I talk to him but justification justification is what chopping off of your past sins get rid of that old person that old thing that bothered you just try to try to try to get rid of that all right but now look you got to come to sanctification and inside your souls where the unclean Spirit leaves you all right everybody with me on that not the spirit because we're going to talk about the spirit realm all those other little demons that can't get in your soul anymore when we start going outside your perfect man that's the ones that get in your five senses of memory reasons conservation imagination and by with me because that's you you say well brother Brown preached the greatest battle ever fought it's in your mind well where is your mind it's not your brain right right it's because somebody's in the control tower telling you no but you got the this part saying okay amen so the sanctification we're talking about in baby form is getting that unclean Spirit out let it die get it out and don't let it come back because we fill it with a holy ghost it seals you as we'll talk about here in just a second and then we talked about excuse me brother Bob said he's going to speak on this a little bit so that's good in Ezekiel because see remember he gives you a new spirit and that's not the spirit not the spirit of God to begin with hey bye with me when we go to the outer Court in the inner Court the inner court is not the holy of holies it's the holy place but that inner Court several priests could go into there everybody with me we'll talk about this afternoon you could go behind the first Veil and you'd have the candlesticks which was artificial light amen you had the shoe bread altar of incense not the holy of holies that's when you step in to sanctification if you don't get all that stuff gone out of you and going into the holy of holies this out here didn't do them people any good right it did not if that high priest didn't go behind that lack that second Veil the second Veil The Soul and God didn't come down and take the people's sins whatever happened in the second Court meant nothing right everybody with me so that's the same way with God now that Spirit isn't God's spirit that's your spirit God gives you a new spirit then he says I'll put my spirit in him step on into the holy of holies but the thing God has to do is give you a new spirit make your nature a little more gentle and settle down or he couldn't he live with you you know on the outside get into it this morning I'll talk about it this afternoon but the outside Court they can even call that was the court of gentiles that was court of the Gentiles anybody can go out there it was a mess sacrifices by the thousands Brazen authors the smell of of of of of entrance burning and and all that stuff and the priests having to wash theirself they made it foreign [Applause] we actually didn't wait on you but we've been waiting on you okay huh oh you're listening on the car okay all right so you already knew what a cop said about you limp okay well you can't do anything around here there's cameras everywhere and there's whatever so when you but but out here but now when you go you can't take all those other people and go into that second Veil which is sanctification it eliminates a whole bunch of junk right and there's only a certain amount of priests could go in this but only one in that Veil right there why did we need the Veil to be rent the world knows of Christendom that Jesus died on a cross for him and he was that high priest any you know the people understand that but you and I when the seals broke man didn't break them from the bottom to the top God broke them from heaven and broke them from the top and revealed who Christ was and that Christ could get into you and make the same life live in you that lived in him there's the difference that's the opening of the word in the end time so the baptism of the holy ghost seeing you have purified your soul soul Saul and obeying the truth through the spirit under unfeigned love of the Brethren what that's a Godly love unfeigned which means it doesn't if you love me I'll love you if you give me ten dollars I'll take it and and I'll owe you see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently remember that quote I read it first fervently I mean how many of you really like going to work some of you that are retired can think back Joe well Joe's got Brothers working yeah you go back into the room but most of us don't like so much to go to work because you know why because that's where the devils are all right but why not here why not here that we bring our Devils here with us being born again not a corruptable seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever Romans 8 verse 29 says for whom he did 4-0 he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son listen you and I are not just here we're predestinated to be here we're predestinated there is someone in this age is going to take this message and live it to a body change somebody you just got to decide whether you are or not for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might want be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate then he called who he called he justified who he justified them he also glorified then what can we say if God be for us who can be against us but look Romans 11 says God hath not Cast Away his people which he foreknew you and I was what he came to die for he come to die for the whole world but to unveil itself to a small group of people oh bride amen an intimate relationship between you and God not just whatever goes on out here and whatever goes on out here no holy of holies there was actually there was two people in there God and that person but now it tells us to go back behind that Veil because the veil's been rent that we that if we don't go behind the veil is death to go behind the veil was death we'll talk about this afternoon though God had one man that could go behind that Veil and it didn't bother him didn't matter if he was anointed didn't matter what kind of clothes he had on hello somebody Moses could go in that Veil just about any time God told him to because we're going to see it this afternoon we're going to find out something that maybe some of you didn't know about Aaron's rod maybe I'll come back second service probably not but that start anyway in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together and won all things in Christ's boats which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him who also look we have obtained an inheritance go get it you gotta come get this inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the Council of his own will let's continue on and whom also you trusted look after this you heard the word of Truth you had to hear the word of Truth to get born again all right the gospel of your salvation and whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise which is what the earnest of our inheritance and to the Redemption of the purchased possession the praise of his glory what is the earnest of our inheritance it's a down payment you get the uh we're gonna read it this afternoon where brother Brown said it's kind of like a button on my shirt I like this because it was on his shirt he said this but he said the Holy Ghost is like a button on my shirt he said it goes inside of you and it begins to grow oh no brother that button always was there well I'll just I'll read you a quote one word off folks one word one word off is not going to take us to a body change now look staff you're a perfect man if you die take the blood out of a man you embalm him this is a new quote so you need to listen to this one I haven't read this 42 times this is the first time I've read it trouble of it is a lot of them never get embalmed you take the blood out of the man he's gone then the only thing you do is put another Blood back in him he's going to live again you took his blood out now watch and now this is not your perfect man now we've put the blood of Jesus Christ in us see and that brings the faith of Jesus Christ The Virtue of Jesus Christ The Temperance of Jesus Christ the patience of Jesus Christ it's not yours anymore that's why the renewing of your mind is not well I'm just a patient person that ain't got nothing to do with being having Godly patients godliness of Jesus Christ the brotherly kindness of Jesus Christ and look he wound it all up and the love of God which is Jesus Christ he's the head and controls you and your feet is the foundation Faith amen controlled by the head take the there you are there's the perfect man of God look when he possesses these virtues you got to possess them all right acts 1 verse 4. he said to them this is Jesus talking it's not for you to know the times of the seasons which the father has put his own power but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me we're going to take the Tabernacle this afternoon it was after the high priest went in the high priest didn't go in there with the forgiveness he walked in there to get forgiveness but when he come out oh praise God he got it he ate for the whole nation they depended on that was the power that God give that high priest he could say oh Lord by all these people they've seen they've done this that and the other he said sprinkle the blood seven times on the on the post he said I know what they've done he said but if you'll do this you walk back out and you tell the whole nation your sins are forgiven for a year one year but now it's not one year folks now we go back in there and he says your sins are forgiven for an eternity hey man a more greater cloud of witness we have now a greater thing than just that Tabernacle was totally totally uh uh it was not permanent they had to pick it up okay and where is it today scattered everywhere the components of it scattered everywhere they put them in a temple and they put them over here and they put them in Solomon's Temple now we know who has them we know the Catholic church has all the menorah and all that other stuff what about that the very seed of Satan has God's equipment see how close that is though but you shall receive power after that you go behind the veil after you have no power before that you have power when you go behind the veil Jesus was telling them when I get into you because listen all the all the disciples they knew about that Tabernacle they went to the temple they had the outer Court the inner Court Solomon's Temple was still there during that day remember Jesus walked up in Matthew 24 they said well what about this he said they won't be a stone left after this is over with and they're like that's 40 something years to build this thing of course Jesus knew he knew they were talking about he knew he was talking about this body they were talking about a building but that building did get destroyed there's nothing left of that of that Temple just some Foundation stones remember the bride tree was eat down to a stump the bride tree was eat down to a foundation but it didn't touch the life the life is still there God is going to have life he's going to have a bride it may look bad you know we always hear the quote where people said somebody come up to us not several years ago and said boy really looks bad for the bride no never never it might look bad for the church it might look bad for the unbeliever it might look bad for the make-believer but it is not bad for the bride this is exactly where we're supposed to be this is exactly what we're supposed to do so if we're in the will of God whose other will you want to be the will of your flesh and you shall be witnessed unto me both Jerusalem Judea Lula Georgia and that power is dunamis so in other words you've got to go you got to go get it the high priest didn't say now Lord you you're gonna have to I'm on stream today sorry for the people I have to strain that's okay but if you stream and you but you healthy enough to come to church you're wrong so the high priest here we're going 20 20 22 the high priest is going Lord I'm not going behind the holy of holies today I don't uh I got this little sniffle but I'm gonna just pull you up online the whole nation of Israel would have died because God would not have forgiven with their sins but he had to go behind the veil he had to go do something he had to go into the holy of holies he had now he had to be dressed right he had to have a wall all over him he had to have a certain kind of to get back there and sprinkle and then he didn't stay there long he come out because you know why he had a message he had a powerful message that's why without the Holy Ghost you can't preach the message the way you're supposed to you can't because you hadn't went behind the bill why brother mom always say you got to go to the back side of the desert you got to have a burning bush experience you got to have a holy of holies you gotta have an experience because then you can come out with power or dunamis inherent power power residing in a thing or in a you number two so what is the Holy Ghost brother Daniel what's the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost what's the evidence of the Holy Ghost those who had the spirit the teacher heard the word and that spirit in them took the word and taught it or revealed it to them and they were of that group that heard the messenger and his message and took it and lived it hmm Romans 10 verse 9 says if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth that's what we're talking about confession and believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation confesses to admit or declare oneself guilt of what one is accused of I'm a sinner Lord ain't nothing I can do about it right now but I can only say I'm giving it to you you said cast your burdens on me cast your cares give me because listen how many of us have ever forgiven ourself of our sins see that's silly we laugh if you justify what you do then guess what that's what it is it's you justifying yourself but let's lay it on the altar get rid of it confess your faults one to another pray one for another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man available I love these adjectives I love this we got to do something the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much possessors to acquire get procure thing for oneself to possess the merry wife first Thessalonians that every one of you should know how to possess we read this before possess his vessel in sanctification and honor in other words if you sit in this church as long as you sit in this church we got problems trials and tribulations but we should know how to handle things we should know when the Devil comes and we see something and we're able to throw up a throw up a shield all right maybe we can't say that about every church but we can say that about this one amen we've been taught well when the inspiration of the Holy Ghost is here to inspire you did you come here to get inspired by the holy ghost or just come in because I was going to talk about you if you didn't show up grief but when the inspiration of the holy spirit is here to inspire you remember God will make your body come into your confession if you say you're a drunkard you want a drink don't worry you'll get one if you say you're a sinner and want to sin you're be right into it if you say you're a Christian and believe it all along God will bring your testimony we'll bring you right into it if you believe in healing and believe that God has healed you confess it and God will make your body obey your confession for he is the high priest of your confession come on think about that so people touch the Garment of Jesus was made well others smacked him in the face remember the Romans hit him in the head with sticks spitting his face never felt any virtue at all it was their attitude of approach it depends you come in if you come believing that you're coming to get help and you're confident that you're coming to the right person not William Branham not Samuel Dale not Bob black Jesus Christ and your coming has provided way of approach everything had to be right you're going to receive something if you come reverently just like the brass serpent why the brass serpent the serpent didn't have any virtue it was a piece of brass they brought up out of Egypt neither did the pole have any virtue not a bit but it was obey what God Said do you know is that when we fall off yes I'll just go ahead and admit because you're not gonna say amen I like men and myself no obeying what God Said dudes what brought the power well I don't have no power I don't have no Victory are you doing exactly what God Said dude are you doing everything that you humanly possible and then not even humanly possible but supernaturally possible what brought the virtue is obedience to the word of God so it's not me telling you got to come to church if you don't have a guy to come to church better than you then you're of the devil Bob didn't get many amends out of that but that's what it is look obedience to the word of God that's the same thing tonight it was obeying what God Said does what brought the power what brought the virtue is obedience to the word of God not obedience to me or anybody else it's obedience to the word of God so like I said before these people leaving a message because they say brother Brown's wrong and this is wrong and this is wrong he's wrong here and he's wrong there that's okay but if you cut your hair and wear pants and don't go to church you're gonna have to talk to God about that not William Branham amen because God didn't change his mind about his word and he will not change his mind about his word whether you believe brother Brown was a prophet or not you still going to come to the day of judgment and you're gonna have to give an account of why you didn't do what the word of God said but without faith though it is impossible to please God for he that cometh to God must believe that he is because look that journey of Abraham he had to believe that man that was talking listen how many of you have had a a voice talk to you in your head and say that's God because sometimes that devil voice that talks to me sounds like God oh I guess I'm the only one you know you hear this big booming voice that don't have to be God that could be the devil okay a lot of times what what brother they'll always tell you that it was that little voice that said hey dummy wake up all right not naturally but spiritually hey dummy wake up because you don't have to haul and scream at you but without faith it's impossible to please God all right so you gotta have faith in what faith in the word and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him let's continue a little bit further and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God that word is anakinosis a renewal or a renovation like I said before Brother Gary Krantz if we'd have done something inside the house but this was outside the house but it's the same analogy at my house frame is still there but if we were going to tear out walls and put a new kitchen in and new floors there would be a dumpster out and there still way was one there for all the other stuff that we tore apart but why they need to be renovated God's not going to just take your your whole your body and just destroy you know he's going to use it because see that's Satan's got that one thing on you in his flesh born in sin shape that iniquity getting old that even hurts for me to do that oh some of y'all will say Amen later on but inside you though is a soul that's eternal is so God's going to use Satan's going to go they're getting older God did you see that can't you see that they're they're they're messing up and can't you see that oh look at that one look at that one what they just did and God's going all I see is is a God standing behind you you see these uh fountains that come out of nowhere and it's a whole sheet everybody you've seen those it just comes out of nowhere I have a wall and just a whole sheet that's a sheet of blood God says hang on a man oh they just repented it didn't even get to me it hit the blood and it was gone oh think about it you take you take your accuser he's got this whole list of stuff see that whole list and when he hands that to the judge it's got to go through it's got to go through that curtain go through that blood and when he hands it to when he hands it to God I wish it was blank but it's blank when it goes to that blood it just washes it all away a renovation a complete change for the worse no June likes her front porches screened in now because the Skeeters used to love her because she's so sweet they ain't like me they bit me and they died but really have you enjoyed your renovation have you enjoyed your renovation since you got born again have you enjoyed your renovation have you enjoyed your renovation since we're going to start a statue of perfect man and we're going to learn how to have the mind of God instead of the mind of the devil not going to take away our problems it's going to help us what live through them because these virtues look our old nature is contrary to God our own Nature's contrary to anything of God that's why we were born in sin shaping iniquity right but God's going to take that vessel that Satan is going I'm gonna give it arthritis I'm going to give it cancer I'm gonna give it this I'm gonna give it to him and Freda was here I know she's watching in those arms are going to go up as long as they're breath in that body and I'm gonna say thank you God you give me life and you give me eternal life whatever happens to this dumpster that Satan gave me amen there's a life in there and God hears your voice that's why confession is good for the soul confess it because you're talking into the blood curtain come on and past that blood curtain is nothing but white nothing but white screw it oh somebody say hallelujah thank you my goodness some are saying hallelujah some are saying let's hurry up and get finished beloved when I give all diligence to rounding to you the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you this is Jude and assort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints for there are certain men crept in unawares Preachers brother Brown said word I have my problem the inside women he said preachers my worst problem for there are certain men trapped in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation there's people put in your life to be a thorn in your flesh but what does it do though God forgive them if he's out in the world you'd figure out how to kill him but God forgive them forgive them Lord for they know not did you understand what that means God was hanging on a cross dying he said father forgive them for they know not they didn't know that was a messiah they didn't know that was God in human flesh to them to those Romans it was just another guy that got caught somewhere excuse me and they they got this uh judgment and they're dying and we're just going to take the Flesh and throw it in this dumpster and we'll never see him again until Joseph Obama Thea walks up and says can I have that he was inspired by God can I have that body I want to take it down and put it in a tomb and of course we're all my soldiers like saves us from having to drag this thinking thing off the cross really I mean come on that's that's the world that's the world looks at you and says why are you different that's because what was inside of us is what was different what was inside of Jesus because outside he didn't look different he looked just like me and you but inside of the inside that was God no less if you're born again today guess what no less God lives in you too so in other words you got preachers preaching false Doctrine ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only God in our Lord Jesus Christ here's Jesus standing up telling them he answered the center to them well half Isaiah's prophesied of you Hypocrites as it is written this people honor me with their lips but their heart heart their heart their soul is far from me how being in vain they do worship me he's not talking to Sinners he's talking to church people [Music] I'm being in vain do they worship me teaching preaching over the pulpit for doctrines the Commandments of men for laying aside the Commandment of God you hold the traditions of men when I asked that person one time I said look who told you you could cut your hair who told you you could wear pants who told you you could baptize the way you get baptized some man had to tell you that it wasn't God but somebody stood in the Pulpit said well you ain't perfect and I ain't perfect oh we were talking about this the post office I wish they'd quit asking me questions science says Come As You Are amen amen they said well what do you do with that I said well I'll write one underneath it says but you won't leave as you came come as you are all you want to bring your dirty laundry you're right yeah you're cutting hair bring it here that's why we don't want to be exclusive let God be the excluder not us amen that's what happened in Ohio the other day people I'm not cares it's got to be that because they're talking Christian he's on the internet now his mother he has a relationship with his mother and stepfather he's never had before he said never had a relationship like that since we left from up there they saw God in human being brings them closer you know what God can help him if we bring him closer that's why I hate being exclusive but come as you are what happened with well not Susan hey Susan what happened with um Sandy thank you you knew where I was going with this Sandy would come to church and some most y'all know who Cindy was okay that was Donny's first cousin she came here man she had like tar in her hair so black she was an older lady wore pants and I mean three gallons of lipstick everything else right she came for a few months and she was peeled up as she could be she wouldn't mind me telling you this because she had a change in her life she came as she was she stayed here for several months you know people start murmuring when you gonna say something about that dress code when you're gonna say something about them lips what am I going to say anything about you you want to start picking something we'll just start picking right now but what happened to her though somewhere something clicked we didn't look at her said now Cindy you got 30 days and after them 30 days you can't walk through that door no more listen Jesus hung around Sinners he hung around prostitutes he hung around alcoholic he hung around people like that why Jesus stood up one day and then they asked you why do you do that he said these are the people I come for you I can't help you religious people I can't help but I'm gonna help these Common People okay but now preach in the word of God god brother they are preaching every Wednesday every Sunday never said hardly a word about nothing about no directional hair amen am I telling the truth but one day he'll come send in with a dress on I think you helped her get some yeah Here Comes Cindy with a dress on then Here Comes Cindy she didn't have no red lips she quit putting earring oh she actually had like fish Lures you ever seen those I may have turned her head and it's like they slap everybody around them why do you do that I don't know I mean it just drags your earlobes down and when you get older you're going to look like an elephant but anyway um it's not good for you but who took her in the office he didn't who took her an office and said you got to straighten up no there was a change just a real subtle change a real subtle change she quit wearing earrings she quit wearing her pants she come up to the altar she won the Lord to change her life she wore she never cut her hair after that never wore pants now most people in the message would give her 30 days and would have took her in the office and said don't come in here anymore without with that apparel on now listen folks there is a point but if you really preach the word of money if you really get down to the word of God and preach to the people and it clicks in their soul that soul will turn them not you I turned in people today God's gonna have to do it God's gonna turn what's inside of you and you say well sin is not with us she's an old relationship in a home right I I believe she's safe yeah I believe she's going to have a we will see her yeah yeah we didn't throw her out we preached to her and we didn't preach to her you don't have to do that but what if she'd been in a place where though where they held the traditions of men of washing of pots and washing your face and putting on the right kind of clothes now we know we've we preach Holiness you know that We Don't Preach greasy Grace you're not going Cindy wasn't going to be here a year still doing what she was doing but you could just see something the wheels turning now some people you know what's going to happen they're either going to stay or leave they ain't going to stay under this and we've had some move into our midst and then leave you know and they did it on their own right and they did it on their own right I was watching the baptism the other day we baptized a couple of people that I can't remember what his name is but anyway yeah so anyway but you see those people I mean you you still pray for them but but they'll ease their self out you don't have to preach them out they'll ease yourself out but also then people will ease yourself in too and manafort just preached the word of God drop a little truth in every once in a while drop a little bit of of reading of the Bible of Deuteronomy and and Corinthians and how to how to be a good Christian and how that God will change you not you change God yeah but by the traditions of man that's what Jesus was telling them and he said unto them full well you reject the Commandment of God that ye may keep your own tradition that you may keep your own two Soul Doctrine or seventh under Doctrine or or I will come here with a seed in me that's not God so they lost that that was lost faith so we had to get back to the faith of the fathers we had to have a man named William Branham that we put our confidence in that God brought the mind of himself screw that man and that man could just move over and God could say thus saith the Lord thus saith the Lord this is what I'm trying to tell you people brother Brown will say that God is trying to get us back to the faith of the fathers that's what the Elijah Ministry was done to right it was done to bring us back to the faith of the fathers back to what get rid of the traditions and get back to the faith of the fathers everybody all right let me read this quote real quick and we'll close now in the Old Testament are placed into the family look his name was just as good on the check as his daddy's was they didn't have they had a ring in them days a Signet brother around makes a spitting sound and hits the pulpit well I'm not gonna do that spit on it place it there was a Signet that was just as he wore his daddy's ring it wasn't his it was his daddy's and that was just as good as his daddy's now when Jesus had been obedient Jesus to God God placed him positionally this is him now listen to this right here now when the member is born by the Holy Ghost into the family of God all right stop right there that's what we've been talking about for the past 50 sermons trying to get you get to get you to the new birth to where the Holy Ghost bursts you into the family of God and has proven to have these virtues in him continue on that God can see virtue knowledge Temperance patience brotherly kindness godliness in him then God seals him or places him now now listen you can take this quote and and some of the people in the message say well well see there brother you got to be all the way up there before God seals you with the Holy Ghost see there is a Doctrine and a message you got to go all the way up here before you get the Holy Ghost you can't get these virtues without having a holy ghost that is a that is a ceiling of everything else remember Sister Shepard's Dream Water trash she is already born again but she had some trash same way with me and you then God seals him or places him and there that's when you see the Sons and Daughters of God let's read this real quick perfect faith is a master of all circumstances perfect Faith Masters all circumstances let's continue on we didn't get into this but remember the trying of your faith work is patience but let patience have a perfect work that what you may be perfect an entire wanting nothing is that scripture you say oh I got these needs I got these needs let God start taking care of them problem is you don't want it you want to keep them or you can amen if you want to what brother Brown tell about that woman your brother Brown why did that evil spirit come back on that woman you know what he said she loved it she loved the spirit so it came right back that's our problem that's my problem that's your problem you get through with something and something else pops up to get through something else something else pops up but the trying of your faith working patience crying of your faith so it's got to be tried the Bible says with fire oh my goodness that you may be perfect in entire warning nothing now James tells us this little man say have faith and have not works can Faith save him now as we continue on down through here we know what that is James looks like it means this all works and Paul's talking about all of Faith but now look watch us right here thank God for a prophet faith without works is dead all right now Paul was speaking in Romans about justifying Abraham by faith and James is justifying by works but it does not contradict Paul was speaking of what God saw James is speaking of what man saw in Abraham I want to ask you today before we close Paul is talking to you through the Bible about what God sees all right right got it Paul is telling us justified by faith you believe in God it was unputed imputed unto him for righteousness and then James came back and says hey faith without some works is dead so what are you doing so you're on this side of that blood Shield cause on this side of the bloodshield you're God's kids you're perfect that Genesis 1 26 man is perfect but there's a part of that still inside of you on this side everybody with me so what you got to do is is you got to make sure This is Gonna Hurt that you make sure that the people on this side see the same thing God sees on this side everybody with me that hurt didn't it well then at least it was a frontal assault not from the back but look that's what Paul was talking about what God saw Abraham he was nothing was accounted to Abraham on this side everybody with me perfect um staggered not at the promises of God on this side but over here on this side we're reminded he gave his wife away twice he laughed at God one time he did all these things he he was supposed to go by himself he took lot with him he was supposed to go here he went there but over here on this side God said man after my own heart David on this side murderer liar adulterer apple of my eye the man I want to see is right there so same way with me and you let out now now though now though they did that without the new birth we have the new birth on this side supposed to be the same as on this side so the veil's been wrapped right face to face let's stand let's let the people see from this day forward what God sees there's your works it's good to have faith know all Mysteries but have not love have not the love of God in your heart God bless you Paul was speaking of what God saw James was speaking of what man saw in Abraham let's do one more quote look what faith you have that's what God sees but what your works is what your neighbor sees hmm are they the same show me your works by your faith without your faith and I'll show you my works by my face we've got a our neighbors are are homosexuals and I think everybody knows that pretty much but and they know we go to church and they've asked us probably more questions about what our um religion is than people in the community they just they just have their own opinion but Mike said what what is I mean just tell me what's what is it do you believe so we did kind of you know in a short version now what if though none of y'all well mom and dad lived behind me and Terence and all them too but what if he lived isolated off in the woods somewhere like you did and you're down there and you go tell me you can't hide it and I don't know who's smoking cigarettes I'm just saying that because I had a revelation this weekend my aunt that I've known for 50 years I never knew she Smoked Cigarettes Pat Turpin did you know Patrick so I see that I did the same thing uh-huh yes ma'am all her life I told Ray her husband I said when did she start smoking he said when did she stop he bought three packs of Virginia Slims and I knew they weren't for him I said who you getting him for of course me he said Pat did Pat smoke yeah I even know it so see you can hide it but you can't hide it from God and I don't know anybody smoking but let's just put whatever else we do when nobody's around to see it okay cigarettes or whatever you want to say but that was a revelation it was to me buddy I'm like oh really look right here let me get to this then we'll close that's what's the matter with the people many of them but they're afraid brother Daniel they're afraid to launch out with it you're just afraid to venture a little bit just say well I can I can do all things with Christ who strengthens me amen step out take what you got and use it what have I been telling you all year whatever you got let it out if it's the devil we want him out if it's God we want him out too to show because he's not going to leave but he's going to show let man see what God sees I know that's hard I know we're humans we do things contrary to God every day but he said in his word that we got to be perfect complete do the things of God worship Him in spirit and Truth and do the right things let's sing a song God bless you sing one verse it's almost 12. creation when you made [Music] time [Music] [Applause] [Music] away [Applause] [Music] hey man you just do what's inside pray first [Applause] I'm a new creation I'm a brand new man we
