[10:01] to his coming what a day amen we look

[10:14] we're closer to his coming that's what a
[10:16] day what a day amen good to see
[10:18] everybody house of the Lord if you'd
[10:20] like to turn in Romans 7 where we've
[10:22] been reading remember our thought has
[10:24] been on marriage and divorce but we're
[10:26] taking it into the invisible Union
[10:29] to carry on our
[10:31] thought as to seeing the point of how
[10:35] that we're free from the law and how
[10:38] Grace becomes involved into our lives
[10:41] and remember
[10:42] that now we appreciate the the Memorial
[10:45] Day weekend and everything we appreciate
[10:47] all of the military people that have
[10:49] served and all that are still serving
[10:52] that we can be free and be able to
[10:55] Worship the Lord and all of those that
[10:57] have made the the Great great sacrifice
[10:59] we certainly appreciate them for what
[11:02] they' done to where we could could be
[11:04] here and just pray for one another pray
[11:07] for the the soldiers and the things
[11:09] around the world because they're in an
[11:11] entirely different War now than it used
[11:14] to be it was used to get out and shoot
[11:16] each other but now you don't know who
[11:18] the enemy is a lot of times and
[11:20] everything else it's just taking place
[11:22] and blowing them up on every hand and
[11:24] all like that but just remember these
[11:26] and pray that the Lord would bless amen
[11:29] remember Lord willing Wade will be
[11:30] preaching this coming Wednesday so just
[11:32] keep him in your heart and you know know
[11:36] and Romans 7 any other announcements I
[11:39] generally forget something I had Richard
[11:42] to set the temperature on
[11:44] 70° this morning it was on 70 and
[11:47] everybody said it was hot it run it down
[11:49] to 68 and everybody said it was cold so
[11:51] I said Put it on 70 lock it we'll have
[11:54] to just get along with 70 if we can and
[11:56] you can find it already some doing it
[11:58] you know you know and everything else
[12:00] but we do the best we can but you know
[12:03] you can't do everything to please
[12:05] everybody I said yours ago you know I
[12:07] was down at Disney World one time and I
[12:10] asked a little boy how did he stay cool
[12:11] inside of that big old suit he was in he
[12:14] said he had his own little air
[12:16] conditioner thing in there you know I
[12:17] thought about buying them and bringing
[12:19] them back you know and let everybody sit
[12:21] inside and just turn their own knobs you
[12:24] know to to do but uh we do the best we
[12:27] can all right so don't blame
[12:29] the Heat and all it's just it's just the
[12:31] way it is in life all right Romans 7
[12:34] father we thank
[12:35] you we love you Lord we thank you for
[12:38] all things thank you most of all for
[12:41] your love and your grace unto us we pray
[12:44] that you would just bless each one bless
[12:46] the militaries we were talking about as
[12:49] they around the world taking Lord the
[12:52] place of us to where that we could be
[12:54] free to speak as we can and Lord we know
[12:57] that one day that'll be taken from us
[12:59] but it won't be on the account of that
[13:01] it'll be on the account of Satan and his
[13:03] doings but we we just appreciate it
[13:06] appreciate the opportunity to be able to
[13:07] stand and speak for you we love you and
[13:10] we we just pray that you'd guide us now
[13:13] as we attempt to speak about you you
[13:15] come on the scene into each one of our
[13:17] hearts and lives remember the sick among
[13:19] us and just touch each one and deliver
[13:21] father in Jesus name amen Romans
[13:27] 7
[13:31] know ye not brethren for I speak to them
[13:33] that know the
[13:34] law how that the law had dominion over a
[13:37] man as long as he liveth for the woman
[13:40] which hath an husband is bound by the
[13:41] law to her husband so long as he liveth
[13:46] but if the husband be dead she is loose
[13:47] from the law of her husband so then
[13:50] while her husband liveth she be married
[13:52] to another man she shall be called an
[13:54] adulteress but if her husband be dead
[13:56] she is free from that law so that she is
[13:59] no adulterous though should be married
[14:01] to another man wherefore my brethren ye
[14:04] also are become dead to the law by the
[14:07] body of Christ that you should be
[14:09] married to another even to him who is
[14:11] raised from the dead that you should
[14:13] bring forth fruit unto God for when we
[14:16] were in the flesh the Motions of sin
[14:18] which were by the law did work in our
[14:21] members to bring forth fruit under death
[14:24] now watch it but now we are delivered
[14:26] from the law that being head wherein we
[14:30] were held that we should serve in the
[14:32] newness of spirit and not in the oldness
[14:36] of the letter you may be seated the Lord
[14:38] that is blessing to the reading of the
[14:41] word now trying to just get a
[14:44] point you know and I want to stay on
[14:47] this and then the Lord willing maybe
[14:49] next Sunday we'll get over into the
[14:51] invisible Union and start talking about
[14:53] the new birth and the marriage and
[14:55] divorce and
[14:57] the the thing things that's covered
[14:59] there and then going on to law and Grace
[15:02] but remember the prophet of God said
[15:04] this is a point here that's a greater
[15:07] portion of marriage and divorce and
[15:10] explaining how that we are free from the
[15:15] law you know only by the new birth I
[15:19] know that I've made statements that are
[15:22] you know contrary to a lot of people's
[15:23] thinking but I pray that you will
[15:26] believe it or think about it so we think
[15:29] the law ended at Calvary and all like
[15:31] that that's
[15:32] fine Christ is the end of the law what
[15:36] for
[15:38] righteousness them that
[15:41] believes all a person that's not a born
[15:44] again believer is still under the law
[15:49] right see that's that's what's hard to
[15:51] get people to think
[15:54] about cuz we've been taught all of our
[15:57] life you know that the law ended at
[16:00] Calvary well that's good that's right
[16:03] but it only ended there for the Born
[16:05] Again
[16:07] believer everything else is still under
[16:09] the
[16:10] law all right then now the point is
[16:13] going to be so hard to try to accept or
[16:16] belief that we're talking about after
[16:19] you're born
[16:21] again so I want to get this out of the
[16:23] way where I can preach on the new birth
[16:26] and and you know and that way we can
[16:28] hold a point to the to what I
[16:31] want that we talk about after we're born
[16:34] again well the law see the other group
[16:36] says Law's done away with we don't have
[16:38] no law no more we're we're in
[16:42] Grace well then the people at the same
[16:45] time that they're talking about Grace
[16:48] are the most
[16:49] legalistic people that's ever been
[16:52] thought
[16:54] of see why do we want to look at dos and
[16:57] don'ts
[17:02] well don't you believe in living right I
[17:04] do I believe that if you're a born again
[17:09] Christian then Christ will be in your
[17:12] heart to live in
[17:15] you and then if you don't in other words
[17:18] if you go out and live like the devil
[17:20] you are the
[17:22] devil that's why I'm not just a Clos
[17:24] line as we talk about or hire and dress
[17:27] and cloth preacher like that because
[17:29] show me where it's ever done any
[17:32] good I'm just honest I'm honest to you
[17:35] as I can be show me a church that's any
[17:38] better dressed or any better action the
[17:40] women Etc than what's
[17:43] here but yet people think that I'm not
[17:46] against those
[17:47] things I'm against any sin whatsoever in
[17:50] any you me or who it
[17:54] is but I realize that we still are bound
[17:58] by
[17:59] by the human elements that we
[18:03] are you see that's where people are so
[18:06] they become so religious they raise up
[18:08] into an atmosphere and they shout and
[18:11] Glory Hallelujah and everything but then
[18:14] when they come down they can't walk too
[18:17] straight well why not just go about all
[18:20] day being what you are that's right I
[18:22] mean I've worked with these brothers
[18:24] there General Motors for many years and
[18:26] all before we all retired
[18:30] and they can tell you whether I lived
[18:31] any different dire than I live here you
[18:34] know I I just try to be the same well I
[18:38] thought that's what the Christian was
[18:39] supposed to be
[18:42] right I mean when we go you know we we
[18:46] go hunting or something like that we
[18:48] don't run down to the liquor store and
[18:50] get us some beer and stuff and go over
[18:52] and secretly you know drink a little and
[18:54] do this that and the
[18:57] other
[18:59] why because we're not we don't do those
[19:03] things you know old saying goes all but
[19:06] when we get it free we'll let her High
[19:07] down well if you let your high down come
[19:09] and find out it's in your eyes and you
[19:12] can't see Christ then that's just the
[19:15] best way of saying
[19:16] it but that's what I'm trying to get us
[19:18] to see and I just want us to go through
[19:20] some scriptures and just the main thing
[19:24] is to realize one
[19:27] thing
[19:28] that even though we are born again
[19:32] Christians we are still Bound
[19:38] by our legalistic
[19:41] ideas and
[19:44] thoughts because everybody has basically
[19:46] a a way of being if you have talk with
[19:49] Adolf Hitler as as mean as he was he
[19:52] would have probably had some real good
[19:53] side to him because that's a moral part
[19:55] of a human
[19:57] being
[19:59] but you see then you say but brother
[20:03] Dale if I'm born again I'm born again
[20:07] amen but that only deals with the
[20:11] soul it doesn't deal with your body and
[20:13] your
[20:16] spirit see then we've got to see that
[20:18] we've got to bring that under
[20:21] subjection amen we've got to bring these
[20:24] things that we are under subjection to
[20:27] that we just don't go out and live like
[20:29] the devil and claim to be
[20:32] Christians if we live like the devil we
[20:34] are the devil that's
[20:38] sensible but see let let's don't get to
[20:40] a self-righteous situation you know that
[20:43] we don't do this or don't do
[20:47] that we think that makes us some kind of
[20:49] a
[20:51] righteousness there is no righteousness
[20:54] outside of the blood of Jesus Christ
[20:57] amen the Bible says it says filthy rags
[21:00] in the sight of
[21:02] God brother Bram in the Hebrew series
[21:04] said i' hate to think that I was born 5
[21:07] minutes ago and had to go to heaven on
[21:09] some merriage that I'd
[21:12] have he said because I'd born in sin
[21:14] shap it in iniquity spouse my mother's
[21:17] wound a
[21:18] liar you see then that way then we're
[21:22] not brother brandom that was the point
[21:24] that that when I begin to see the way he
[21:26] was bringing it out
[21:29] I could see that we we were all
[21:32] failing because we were just you know
[21:35] believing this or believing that and he
[21:37] starts laying it
[21:39] down and he says do we sin he said every
[21:44] day he said every
[21:47] day he said but we believe in the
[21:53] atonement is there any of us without sin
[21:57] no
[21:58] well then what's the difference in the
[22:00] little sin or the big
[22:02] sin then we better depend upon the blood
[22:05] of Jesus
[22:08] Christ then to live the best we can is
[22:13] commendable because as I said a moment
[22:15] ago then if we go out and live like the
[22:17] devil we are the devil so it's not a
[22:19] choice it's not a fact that we're trying
[22:22] to do this or trying to be
[22:24] righteous we just be what we
[22:26] are
[22:28] I drink all the liquor I want to don't
[22:31] you I smoke I do all all I want to why
[22:35] because I don't want
[22:40] to see then we we we can't get it to the
[22:43] right place of trying to
[22:48] understand but I hope you following what
[22:50] I'm saying especially like this morning
[22:52] the prophet saying there's no saving
[22:55] power whatsoever in the law
[22:58] he said it's a school Master we'll get
[23:00] to that in a minute it's a policeman to
[23:03] put you in
[23:05] jail there's nothing in the law can get
[23:07] you out of
[23:09] jail you got to serve your
[23:12] sentence you know there's no Grace with
[23:15] it there's no
[23:17] opportunity it only brought a
[23:21] knowledge see before the law remember
[23:24] what we were covering that before the
[23:25] law there was no Record Keeper there was
[23:28] no knowledge point of
[23:30] sin up until the law was given by
[23:34] Moses but I mean you done been 2,000
[23:37] years plus a good
[23:38] bit you think all of them people in
[23:41] there didn't
[23:42] sin well they would never be judged them
[23:45] people cuz there was no law to be judged
[23:47] by you judg by your own
[23:53] conscience like I was discussing with
[23:55] somebody while ago about it you'd say
[23:58] well The Exodus 19 when they said you
[24:02] know whatever you say do we'll
[24:06] do well that looks good you say well
[24:09] what should they have said they
[24:11] shouldn't have said anything they
[24:12] already said Amen on what God had done
[24:14] told them that they were
[24:16] right he told them they were a royal
[24:18] people a priesthood a great nation and
[24:21] that he always be would be with him they
[24:23] would have said
[24:25] amen thank you Lord
[24:30] no see whatever you want us to do we'll
[24:33] do it then we found out the prophet kep
[24:37] emphasizing what they chose law instead
[24:40] of
[24:43] Grace and God
[24:45] knew did you you understand that God
[24:48] knew what they
[24:51] wanted and he gave them the desires of
[24:53] his heart their
[24:55] heart cuz it was never his will to
[24:57] brought
[25:00] law see but but I don't understand cuz
[25:03] that's written in the Bible and you're
[25:05] trying to say that I didn't say that
[25:07] brother random did you got to fuss with
[25:09] him first you
[25:11] know but then you think about
[25:14] it they made it a book of
[25:19] rules the Bible is not a book of
[25:23] rules it is all the way from Genesis to
[25:26] revelation the revelation of Jesus
[25:30] Christ there not a book of rules in
[25:32] there it's not something that you can
[25:34] find to make yourself
[25:37] better all you can find in there is we
[25:39] accept it right amen see we say when I L
[25:44] I sought the Lord I sought the Lord and
[25:46] the Bible says no man sought God now
[25:49] that's not doing away with the fact that
[25:50] you cried and prayed and fasted no that
[25:54] was you getting yourself out of the way
[25:57] where God could speak to you because
[26:00] that's all fasting is for fasting is to
[26:03] get rid of the flesh you cutting off the
[26:05] needs of the flesh you know and you
[26:08] making it to where you can commit
[26:09] yourself to the
[26:12] Lord see then once you get it then you
[26:15] can see that those Ten Commandments are
[26:18] that whole Bible the Old Testament was a
[26:21] revelation of Jesus Christ just as well
[26:23] as we read of the New
[26:26] Testament because it was showing in
[26:27] Christ
[26:30] right not as a book of
[26:33] rules not as something to to tell us to
[26:36] make us better right they took it and
[26:40] made it that
[26:43] way when you read Thou shalt not kill
[26:45] see you turn it around instead of making
[26:47] it Thou shalt not
[26:51] kill why not read it this way especially
[26:54] to us
[26:56] now a born again
[27:00] Christian should
[27:02] say there's no nature in me to
[27:07] kill there's no desire in me to
[27:10] kill take each commandment and read it
[27:13] like that changes the whole thing and
[27:16] then you'll see brother around and said
[27:17] they didn't get what they thought they
[27:18] got that they got God in letter
[27:22] form and they got what will judge
[27:26] them
[27:28] right the whole world is going to be
[27:31] judged by this
[27:33] Bible you say well then what about those
[27:36] that that's never heard they'll be
[27:38] judged by their moral obligation or
[27:40] their conscious part of
[27:43] them see so they have God has a way of
[27:48] judging a word to judge by but there's
[27:52] no saving
[27:55] power it can only bring us to a
[27:59] knowledge a knowledge that we're
[28:02] Sinners well why would you want that I'm
[28:05] I'm I'm back on this morning I can't
[28:08] leave that part to think about cuz that
[28:11] just amazes me to think that God had
[28:14] given
[28:16] Israel the atonement the sacrifices the
[28:20] the healings the the prophit to lead
[28:22] them and they wanted the Book of
[28:26] Rules they wanted something to
[28:29] do but see my warning is to you and I
[28:32] like this morning is Les Satan tempt you
[28:35] through his subtility as he did Eve
[28:38] through what the Bible says the
[28:39] Simplicity that is in Christ
[28:47] Jesus you say yeah but if you preach it
[28:50] and you don't preach it to to condemn
[28:52] people they'll just go out and do things
[28:53] wrong well no wonder they're lost
[28:58] somebody tell me just you
[29:00] know one of my favorite one of my wife's
[29:03] favorite sayings is you can say
[29:05] something about say well what do you
[29:07] expect them to do they're
[29:09] lost you said my neighbor down there is
[29:12] doing well what do you expect them to do
[29:13] they're
[29:17] lost yeah but they claim to be saved
[29:19] well that don't have nothing to do with
[29:20] you you're not known by your
[29:22] claims you're known by the life you
[29:26] live all right
[29:30] Paul here is explaining that a man as
[29:34] long as he
[29:38] lives he's Bound by the
[29:43] law see that's why when we get to the
[29:45] invisible Union it's going to be so much
[29:47] that we've got to cover it the new
[29:50] birth see the soul can be set free
[29:54] totally
[29:56] justified
[29:59] see then to come through marriage and
[30:00] divorce and see that the things that was
[30:03] wrong was wiped clean and
[30:06] way didn't go on to see that we're not
[30:08] trying in any way as we were reading
[30:10] this morning the prophet talking about
[30:12] making a denomination out of
[30:17] things what about
[30:20] Adam what about Adam we're talking about
[30:23] this
[30:24] morning and when God came down where did
[30:26] he get fig leaves he got them from his
[30:30] wife he got them from her
[30:33] Doctrine
[30:35] right her Doctrine see it started right
[30:38] there we need a covering we need
[30:39] something to
[30:42] do and she thought that that covered
[30:50] her I I think God has a little better
[30:52] Vision than even Superman but I always
[30:54] thought we believe the carnality of
[30:57] thoughts of mind that even
[30:59] of that he could look through walls and
[31:02] everything else you
[31:06] know a lot of people maybe hear that and
[31:09] they wonder what you're talking about
[31:10] was old comic strip character called
[31:12] Superman could fly and everything else
[31:14] it was fictitional
[31:16] just using it to short
[31:19] Point see God knew the desires of the
[31:22] people's heart even though it looked
[31:25] good what they were
[31:27] saying the desire in their heart was to
[31:31] have something to
[31:36] do but don't you believe in living right
[31:38] brother Dale
[31:41] no no not after I saw this message what
[31:44] this Prophet was talking about I don't
[31:46] believe in living
[31:49] right no I believe in being born
[31:55] again and then after I'm born again I'm
[31:57] going to make faults and failures and
[32:01] mistakes Grace is going to have to cover
[32:07] that because if not where is my
[32:09] atonement
[32:11] right that's why the scripture say he
[32:13] that receive the knowledge of the
[32:15] truth now remain us no more
[32:20] sacrifice now I've tried my best to
[32:22] explain that to you in in human
[32:26] terms
[32:27] if I don't know something's wrong I go
[32:29] do
[32:31] it and then I find out it's
[32:35] wrong all right God could wink at my
[32:38] ignorance
[32:40] right but if I do it
[32:44] again there's no
[32:49] sacrifice I've got to
[32:52] repent the first one might have been
[32:54] covered by the
[32:56] blood through
[32:59] ignorance but after receiving the
[33:01] knowledge of the truth there remaineth
[33:03] no more
[33:05] sacrifice he said well look at what
[33:08] we've all done all
[33:11] right that's what I'm try my best to
[33:14] preach is to get you and I to be realize
[33:17] one thing we need to
[33:24] repent we need to cry out for repentance
[33:31] I thank God every day for saving my soul
[33:33] don't
[33:37] youen why because I know and realize
[33:39] what I
[33:42] am but see Paul is saying as long as a
[33:45] man
[33:48] liveth all right now he's using the
[33:51] example we'll get back to it when we
[33:53] start on the next message that if you're
[33:55] born again you're supposed to die die
[33:59] right
[34:02] right and then it's no longer I that
[34:05] liveth the Christ that liveth in
[34:09] me but see that is only dealing with the
[34:12] new
[34:14] birth that's in your
[34:16] soul so now this will be the thought for
[34:19] today so I titled
[34:20] it becoming
[34:24] free cuz this is what I want us to think
[34:28] about if we die to ourselves and become
[34:31] born
[34:33] again we can then
[34:36] start does everybody Shake Yourself H
[34:39] you higher
[34:40] sleepy listen to what I'm
[34:44] saying at the time we receive the new
[34:47] birth we can start the process of
[34:51] becoming free
[34:54] right you're not free at just ification
[34:57] you're just repentance you're not free
[34:59] at sanctification that's cleansing
[35:02] process getting ready but when you
[35:04] receive the new
[35:06] birth you just start the process of
[35:09] being
[35:12] free well I I thought the New Birth has
[35:14] set everything
[35:17] free see that's where you got that
[35:20] denominational idea from
[35:22] somebody that's not in the
[35:25] word right
[35:28] you see we start the process of becoming
[35:32] free doesn't the Bible say what being
[35:35] born again
[35:38] how by The Incorruptible word of
[35:44] God not us lining up to get
[35:49] better if you think it's only that if we
[35:52] could get ourselves lined up in the
[35:54] flesh then we do need to just start
[35:57] making
[35:58] records and we'll just take one person
[36:01] at the time you know we'll just write
[36:03] down do's and
[36:07] don'ts well the problem is if you
[36:09] started with me you'd never get off the
[36:10] first
[36:12] one right cuz I'm a human
[36:18] mortal I don't believe that you got to
[36:20] sin no I just know we
[36:25] will they didn't didn't have to sin in
[36:27] the garden but God knew they
[36:30] would they didn't have to want a law but
[36:33] God knew they
[36:38] would see then we're becoming
[36:42] free a process
[36:45] adoption what do you want to call it
[36:47] statue of perfect man whatever you want
[36:50] to talk
[36:51] about put it in there and just see that
[36:53] but you got to start the process by the
[36:55] new birth
[37:00] amen and that'll make the soul Eternal
[37:03] pure
[37:04] perfect totally
[37:08] justified not even the fact of saying
[37:10] that you done it and then was forgiven
[37:12] no it means totally we'll get to it that
[37:15] the real you never did do anything the
[37:17] real you is that new
[37:20] birth that new birth never did do
[37:23] anything that eternal life that we have
[37:25] amen but we you got this other part of
[37:27] us to deal with why do you think we've
[37:29] been here 50 years since the prophet is
[37:33] gone
[37:36] right well we're waiting on you brother
[37:38] Dale we'll get out the Whip and start
[37:41] beating or whatever you know let's get
[37:43] out of here I'm not only getting old I'm
[37:46] getting tired
[37:48] of of our ideas and our
[37:55] thoughts listen let's just go through
[37:57] some scriptures now just just read some
[38:00] scriptures and just think about the
[38:02] scripture of what it's saying so let's
[38:04] go to Romans
[38:07] 8 let's just read the scriptures and
[38:10] just think about it only got a couple of
[38:13] quotes today we got a lot of
[38:15] scripture Romans 81 says there is
[38:18] therefore now no condemnation to them
[38:21] which are in Christ
[38:25] Jesus
[38:29] no do we want to stop there
[38:33] right but did we read the rest of the
[38:36] scripture who walk not after the flesh
[38:40] but after the spirit so now evidently
[38:43] somebody that is even free of all
[38:46] condemnation is going to still walk
[38:49] after the
[38:53] Flesh and a lot of that is normal living
[38:58] you
[39:00] know well since I got born again boy I
[39:03] don't have no problems or nothing I
[39:05] don't have no lust problem nothing Well
[39:08] procreation take care of that and the
[39:11] problem with that is the preachers that
[39:12] I've heard preach like that has got
[39:14] eight or 10
[39:15] kids I think they
[39:18] was of course it's always kind of funny
[39:20] they could they holler birth control
[39:23] birth control and had about eight and
[39:24] then all at once they don't have no
[39:31] more they changed their
[39:35] believing you
[39:37] know
[39:40] okay watch now what Paul says for the
[39:43] law of the spirit of life in Christ
[39:45] Jesus hath made me free from the law of
[39:50] sin and
[39:52] death
[39:54] now the law of the Spirit of life in
[39:57] Christ
[39:58] Jesus the new
[40:00] birth made me free from the law of sin
[40:04] and death so when you're born again you
[40:07] can never
[40:12] die
[40:14] no for what the law could not
[40:17] do and then in that it was weak through
[40:21] the
[40:23] flesh now what does that mean
[40:27] for what the law could not do in that it
[40:29] was weak through the
[40:31] flesh now the law is the letter of God
[40:34] the word now where is the weakness in
[40:36] the
[40:37] flesh you mean has God got a weakness in
[40:40] his
[40:41] flesh and it's not saying that is
[40:44] it it's talking about this flesh right
[40:47] amen right it's talking about you and I
[40:50] who have the new
[40:54] birth but our flesh is
[40:57] weak Paul said the things I would I do
[40:59] not etc etc we'll get to that in a
[41:02] minute but think about
[41:05] it I pray that that we have never made
[41:08] it to the young ones to listen or think
[41:10] about that we've all tried to make us a
[41:13] self-righteous great big thing but to
[41:16] just realize we're all
[41:18] human you
[41:20] know is we're all
[41:23] human we're just saved by grace through
[41:26] faith
[41:29] that way we're not beating on somebody
[41:30] else and
[41:32] all it was weak through the F flesh the
[41:35] flesh couldn't do it the flesh can't
[41:38] keep the
[41:40] law that's right
[41:45] right is it
[41:48] true this flesh always wants to just
[41:52] push over the edge just to
[41:55] her and when the law says 55
[42:02] 56 just push just a little
[42:05] bit
[42:09] right cuz it's weak right we're not Born
[42:13] Again In the
[42:14] Flesh if we was we wouldn't have any
[42:17] trouble with
[42:21] it weak through the flesh God sending
[42:23] his own son in the likeness of sinful
[42:26] flesh not sinful in the likeness like us
[42:29] not a sinful body but in the likeness
[42:32] looking like us living like us being and
[42:35] for sin condemn sin in the
[42:38] flesh now he
[42:40] condemned sin in the flesh what is he
[42:47] saying he
[42:51] showed are you listening he showed the
[42:55] flesh could be
[42:59] conquered well but what it was was his
[43:02] flesh didn't have no
[43:03] problem the Bible
[43:06] says that he was tempted in all
[43:09] points as we
[43:13] are brother R said he's even tempted of
[43:21] women now I mean if if if I was the
[43:25] devil
[43:29] that's the guy I'd be picking
[43:32] on
[43:35] right it wouldn't be no challenge to
[43:37] pick on somebody that just flops over in
[43:40] sin and just does
[43:42] anything right but to the one who would
[43:44] challenge me on it and try to control
[43:47] but see he condemns sin in the
[43:51] flesh he
[43:53] showed that we didn't have to sin
[43:57] right good old Baptist we we just have
[43:59] to sin a little
[44:01] bit now where's that at in the
[44:04] Bible you know well we're not all
[44:06] perfect you
[44:08] know I ain't never claimed to be perfect
[44:11] I'm claim to be saved
[44:14] amen that's that's the only thing all
[44:18] right but
[44:20] once why did he do that why did God come
[44:24] down and die
[44:27] In the
[44:29] Flesh that the righteousness of the
[44:33] law nothing wrong with the
[44:37] law as long as we're thinking it's God's
[44:41] word right right that the righteousness
[44:45] of the law might be fulfilled where in
[44:48] us what who walk not after the flesh but
[44:52] after the
[44:54] spirit
[44:58] now does that look like that there's a
[45:01] whole lot of problems
[45:03] no it looks like this third grade
[45:05] reading we can
[45:09] understand that none of us were capable
[45:11] of living the
[45:14] law and when it was coming to the point
[45:17] then he would have to come and make a
[45:21] way and he did and when he did he
[45:24] brought to a point that he he could live
[45:26] that law himself right but now
[45:30] listen do you think the Pharisees
[45:32] thought he lived a perfect
[45:38] life I remember a few scriptures don't
[45:42] you
[45:44] right well you're you're eating on and
[45:47] you're doing this on the
[45:50] Sabbath and you're not even washing your
[45:54] hands you're just eating without
[45:57] washing do you think he was a perfect
[46:00] person in the eyes of the
[46:05] Pharisees all right
[46:07] then I don't try to be perfect then I
[46:11] just try to be what I
[46:16] am that's just what I try to be I just
[46:18] try to be what I am sure I'm a
[46:23] failure but I believe in an it's
[46:26] moment all right
[46:30] now why then would the law have to be
[46:35] given you
[46:37] know why would the law come into
[46:43] being all right now listen see this may
[46:45] sound like a flip-flop but I'm not so
[46:48] listen it was not God's will to bring
[46:52] the law we read that this morning right
[46:55] all right
[46:56] that's what man wanted right but yet God
[47:00] knew all the time he's going to give the
[47:03] law
[47:06] right he knew he was going to bring the
[47:09] law into
[47:12] being well is anything wrong with the
[47:18] law is there anything wrong with living
[47:23] right come on
[47:27] see that's the way I preach
[47:30] salvation is living right by the word of
[47:34] God but by the spirit within
[47:37] us is anything wrong with doing
[47:42] good
[47:45] no nothing wrong with living
[47:50] good but we order to just realize one
[47:53] thing we can't do it it
[47:57] ourselves
[48:00] right my realizing we can't do it
[48:03] ourselves we've got to have according to
[48:06] the
[48:08] Bible after you're born
[48:10] again an
[48:13] advocate with the
[48:16] father Jesus Christ the
[48:19] righteous what do you need an advocate
[48:21] advocate for if we're so beautiful and
[48:24] perfect like everybody think
[48:29] but you know everybody's got an out
[48:31] because there's no way to win over
[48:32] people anyway like I've always told you
[48:35] about men you there's no need of you
[48:36] arguing with your wife cuz you're not
[48:38] going to win
[48:39] anyway because if you win the argument
[48:43] she's going to say well I'm the weaker
[48:46] vessel you would have know better than
[48:48] take what I
[48:49] said so you lost a battle you know
[48:52] forget it just just go on
[48:57] but
[49:00] listen if God would
[49:03] have you know if if God had have thought
[49:05] we could have made it without the law he
[49:07] wouldn't have brought it into
[49:09] being so now he's going to take what we
[49:14] wanted as a book of rules or something
[49:17] to
[49:18] do and he's going to turn around and
[49:20] with that same law he's going to condemn
[49:23] us to
[49:24] death
[49:33] right and he's going to make us
[49:37] guilty that we can't say anything at
[49:46] judgment you said well brother Dale
[49:48] though we're not going to the white
[49:49] Throne judgment I didn't say
[49:54] that
[49:58] but things have got to be taken care of
[50:01] somewhere so think about it so why was
[50:04] the law why did it come into being if
[50:07] God didn't want to give
[50:10] it you know it wasn't his will to give
[50:13] it but he knew before the world he's
[50:15] going to give
[50:17] it right
[50:20] right he knew before the world we would
[50:22] sin right so he stood as a l slame
[50:25] before the foundation of the
[50:29] world and then when we would come to
[50:36] Earth he would permit the law to come
[50:39] into
[50:43] being and he would make that work for
[50:45] his perfect
[50:50] will because Jesus Christ was the law
[50:53] made alive you agree with with that the
[50:56] word of God Made
[51:01] Alive Now if you'll notice in what we're
[51:06] reading Paul is not talking about just
[51:08] Ten
[51:11] Commandments that's what we think when
[51:13] we say law you say Ten Commandments no
[51:16] the whole
[51:19] word all
[51:23] right but why would he bring the law
[51:26] into
[51:31] being all
[51:34] right go ahead with number two
[51:45] Galatians but the scripture hath
[51:47] concluded all under
[51:49] sin Galatians
[51:52] 3:22 that to Promise by faith of Jesus
[51:55] Christ Christ might be given to them
[51:56] that
[51:59] believe but before Faith
[52:03] came before the new
[52:06] birth right because that's what he's
[52:09] talking about through the promise of
[52:10] faith I given to them that believe the
[52:12] Christian you know but before Faith came
[52:15] we were kept under the
[52:18] law shut up unto the faith which would
[52:22] afterwards be revealed though there was
[52:24] no Gra under the
[52:28] law it locked you up in
[52:31] jail it made you guilty Paul said I
[52:35] would not have
[52:36] known lust if it had all the law hadn't
[52:39] said Thou shalt not
[52:47] covet wherefore the law was
[52:51] what our school
[52:53] Master to bring us under Christ that we
[52:56] might be justified by
[52:58] faith
[53:00] now if that scripture is true there is
[53:03] no way to come to Jesus Christ outside
[53:07] of the law condemning you
[53:13] first are you reading it just reading
[53:16] the
[53:17] scripture this is way I
[53:21] read I I like to look at the scriptures
[53:24] and just read it
[53:26] so now what's that talking
[53:29] about wherefore or
[53:32] therefore the law was our school Master
[53:36] to bring us to
[53:38] Christ that we might be justified by
[53:42] faith see there's no way to come to
[53:44] Christ outside of coming by the law
[53:46] because the law is the letter of the
[53:47] word
[53:48] amen you got to realize you're sinner
[53:51] right that's where people don't want to
[53:53] do that y
[53:57] I was born in this message I ain't never
[53:59] been out there like y'all well that's
[54:04] good but what is a school
[54:12] Master now when I went to school we had
[54:14] a school teacher
[54:17] Y and we had some of them the good ones
[54:20] yeah and you didn't play Belly AES and
[54:23] all of these things you know
[54:26] cuz some of them old ma School teachers
[54:28] just seem like they didn't have no
[54:29] conscience
[54:31] whatsoever everybody agree
[54:35] amen yeah they seem like it was
[54:39] tough ready to beat you to death
[54:43] right but you know
[54:46] what when it's all over with you found
[54:49] out yes
[54:50] sir they done something for you right
[54:53] amen y they w't allow the teachers today
[54:56] to do what those
[54:59] done they w't allow them to pick you up
[55:01] and wear you out
[55:04] and you
[55:08] know you see that's Mama y well the
[55:12] prophet said I don't believe in child
[55:14] delinquency I believe in parent
[55:15] delinquency that's it that's it
[55:18] amen they sent home word to us that our
[55:21] children had been corrected we took some
[55:24] steps
[55:27] yep well they feeding on my poor little
[55:30] old kid y I said what's the
[55:33] problem what' you
[55:36] do well Daddy I didn't do anything they
[55:38] accused me I didn't do it you're lying
[55:42] now you're lying to me now you're going
[55:44] to get a double whooping that's
[55:47] right right that's right but what you
[55:54] mean
[55:55] yeah but it turned out pretty good
[55:59] amen a school
[56:05] Master now let me take the side of the
[56:08] prophets that's talking about
[56:13] adoption and let me try to bring out a
[56:15] point on
[56:18] it see in adoption we think
[56:21] that Christ comes and lives in us and
[56:23] lives and that's great we believe that
[56:28] well if that
[56:31] tutor he's a razor or a school
[56:36] Master that's the Holy Spirit right
[56:40] amen but what if the Holy Spirit didn't
[56:42] have
[56:44] no rules and regulations to teach you
[56:49] right you
[56:52] agree do you get what I mean now you
[56:54] follow me I'm talking about how trying
[56:56] to make the importance of the law which
[56:58] you think I'm against the law see people
[57:00] hearing
[57:03] me
[57:05] no I've never tried to do away with the
[57:09] law because it's my school Master
[57:16] right if I could find all of those men I
[57:19] know they're most dead
[57:21] but I thank everyone that ever helped me
[57:24] during my Christian
[57:28] experience I than every Pastor that ever
[57:31] had you know we had a lot of them at l i
[57:34] mean at
[57:35] gil and some of them the last three
[57:38] months you
[57:40] know but you know what I appreciate
[57:43] every one of them you know what I stood
[57:44] on their
[57:47] side I was a deacon I Stood Beside of
[57:50] him if there was any argument went on I
[57:53] was beside the pastor
[57:55] and I told him I said as long as you're
[57:57] right I'll be here if you're wrong I
[57:58] won't be
[58:02] here I thank God for a school master
[58:05] that could teach me how to read and
[58:07] write in the
[58:11] natural I thank God that he'd give me a
[58:13] tutor to raise
[58:17] me and he can be called your school
[58:23] master but then he gave me the
[58:30] law that that tutor would have something
[58:32] to teach
[58:34] me now I thought we understood from
[58:38] adoption that the tutor was to teach the
[58:41] nature of the
[58:43] father is that true
[58:45] now are we with the message now the the
[58:49] tutor in adoption is to teach you the
[58:51] nature of the
[58:53] father well you want to know the nature
[58:56] of my
[58:57] father you you got a a while to read
[59:00] yeah here he
[59:03] is this Bible is the nature of my
[59:07] father from Genesis to Revelations
[59:13] amen it tells me about my father's
[59:15] nature amen it shows me that even when I
[59:19] do do
[59:21] wrong that he don't throw me out of the
[59:23] family
[59:26] amen may have to whip
[59:31] me may have to correct me
[59:37] amen but right hear is his nature
[59:42] right in the Bible the word of God I'm
[59:45] holding it
[59:48] up so then it is my school Master become
[59:51] a wonderful point now of thinking about
[59:54] the Lord
[59:57] law but the law was
[1:00:00] what held
[1:00:02] me kept
[1:00:07] me but then it directed me to
[1:00:13] God what about a school
[1:00:18] master that we might be justified by
[1:00:21] faith the only way to come to Jesus
[1:00:24] Christ to come by his
[1:00:26] word and when you hear it you're hearing
[1:00:28] the natural letter of the
[1:00:30] word because you're not born again
[1:00:34] you're hearing the natural letter of the
[1:00:36] word and the only way you can get born
[1:00:38] again is hear the natural letter of the
[1:00:40] word well I just out by myself and the
[1:00:43] Lord just fell down and saved me well
[1:00:46] you heard it
[1:00:47] somewhere right right are you read it or
[1:00:51] whatever
[1:00:53] right cuz my Bible says what faith
[1:00:56] cometh by what hear hearing and hearing
[1:01:00] by the word of God right right that's
[1:01:03] what's my school
[1:01:06] master I honor it I cherish
[1:01:11] it because it brought me to
[1:01:15] Christ it brought me to an understanding
[1:01:18] of
[1:01:22] God what about you
[1:01:27] did this message bring you to a better
[1:01:29] understanding of
[1:01:34] God or did it just so set you free until
[1:01:37] you can just live like the devil and
[1:01:38] still claim to be in the
[1:01:46] message so it was our school Master to
[1:01:49] bring
[1:01:51] us unto
[1:01:53] Christ so without it we would never be
[1:01:56] able to come to
[1:02:00] Christ without the law the letter of
[1:02:03] God's word you can never be saved
[1:02:08] right that's right so it sound like I'm
[1:02:11] not throwing off on it now
[1:02:13] huh so when I say the law is the
[1:02:18] letter that's what brought us to
[1:02:20] Christ but when I say like I did
[1:02:23] Wednesday and
[1:02:25] and this morning trying to drive it
[1:02:29] hard that we took the law they took the
[1:02:32] law and tried to make it some
[1:02:36] Grace cuz they chose law instead of
[1:02:39] Grace really they chose law thinking
[1:02:42] that was the word of God you know the
[1:02:45] way of
[1:02:48] God you know if we we we pray if we do
[1:02:51] this we do that we we can we can really
[1:02:54] get you know we can just appease Our
[1:02:59] Father you know you wouldn't talking a
[1:03:02] bunch of about a bunch of uh what do you
[1:03:04] call
[1:03:05] them
[1:03:08] idiots you were talking about people
[1:03:10] that knew the
[1:03:12] law the letter of
[1:03:18] it that's why I love to read
[1:03:21] Paul cuz I see in Paul myself I don't
[1:03:24] mean to claim that to be anything worth
[1:03:26] anything but I see myself in what he
[1:03:30] says I read it and I see
[1:03:35] myself and I realize that there was no
[1:03:37] Wretched Man standing here and who can
[1:03:39] free me from
[1:03:42] this body of death come on
[1:03:49] brother but look
[1:03:51] now wherefore the law is our school
[1:03:54] Master to bring us into Christ that we
[1:03:56] might be justified by faith but after
[1:03:59] faith has
[1:04:01] come we're no longer under the school
[1:04:07] Master for all the children of God by
[1:04:10] faith in Christ
[1:04:12] Jesus so we
[1:04:15] just throw out the
[1:04:18] word right rip it up throw it out cuz
[1:04:22] we're no longer under Master now it's
[1:04:25] what I
[1:04:30] think the Bible says that they come to a
[1:04:33] point there one time that everybody done
[1:04:35] what they thought was right in their own
[1:04:39] eyes right that's
[1:04:44] right lady was telling her husband one
[1:04:46] day going down the road I heard this
[1:04:49] story and brother Randon was telling
[1:04:52] something on the tape and she said
[1:04:53] listen to the that he grabbed a tap
[1:04:55] throw it in the back it ain't no man
[1:04:56] going to tell
[1:04:58] me course he's a follower of this
[1:05:07] message but
[1:05:17] listen then we're all the children of
[1:05:23] God
[1:05:25] we all have to have a school
[1:05:28] Master bless God the holy spirit is my
[1:05:31] school master or do you think he's going
[1:05:34] contrary to the father's
[1:05:37] word all right solved the problem didn't
[1:05:42] it but think about
[1:05:45] it look what Paul had to say in Romans 7
[1:05:49] right down below where we've been
[1:05:50] stopping on our
[1:05:53] reading
[1:05:56] Romans 7:14 says for we know that the
[1:05:58] law is
[1:06:01] spiritual but I am carnal sold under
[1:06:06] sin I told you and you you not you don't
[1:06:09] believe it probably but you enough of
[1:06:12] you had enough rounds for me to tell you
[1:06:14] a thing or two and then you go out and
[1:06:15] find it out it's true you already to
[1:06:19] listen the Baptist teach that Paul
[1:06:22] wasn't born again there he got born
[1:06:24] again in Romans
[1:06:26] 8:1 he was explaining his life as
[1:06:30] getting saved go to Romans 1 and find
[1:06:33] out who it's written
[1:06:38] to Paul is not
[1:06:40] explaining that he needs to be born
[1:06:43] again we know the law is spiritual but
[1:06:47] I'm
[1:06:49] carnal I'm still sold under sin
[1:06:55] no he didn't say he was a sinner he
[1:06:58] didn't say he's going out every day and
[1:07:00] sinning
[1:07:03] no he said I'm just under this condition
[1:07:06] that I'm living
[1:07:08] in of
[1:07:11] Life watch him now the things that he
[1:07:13] goes through and
[1:07:15] he for that which I do I allow
[1:07:20] not for what I
[1:07:22] would that do I
[1:07:25] not but what I hate that do
[1:07:30] I sound like he's pretty honest
[1:07:33] man sound like he's just telling about
[1:07:36] his life don't
[1:07:37] it after he's born
[1:07:43] again then if I do that which I would
[1:07:48] not if I go out and do something wrong I
[1:07:52] consent or agree y that the
[1:07:56] law is
[1:08:00] good go it condemn
[1:08:05] me I
[1:08:08] agree with the word telling me I'm a
[1:08:13] sinner don't
[1:08:21] you now then it is no more I that do
[1:08:28] it but sin that dwelleth in
[1:08:34] me
[1:08:36] Paul are you admitting you're a
[1:08:42] sinner I think he's saying what brother
[1:08:44] random
[1:08:45] says he said we sin every day right
[1:08:49] right and say as long as we're in this
[1:08:51] flesh we will be a sticker right
[1:08:58] right see there's no more ey that do
[1:09:05] it now the eye that do it is no more eye
[1:09:09] than that one can't do
[1:09:12] it and it don't do it it's not I it's
[1:09:17] not the inward part of me that's doing
[1:09:19] it right it's not the soul of me that's
[1:09:23] doing it
[1:09:24] right it is my
[1:09:27] flesh motivated by my spirit remember
[1:09:31] the flesh is worth nothing without
[1:09:33] Spirit listen for I know that in
[1:09:37] me that is in my flesh now you know what
[1:09:40] he's talking about
[1:09:43] right dwelleth no good
[1:09:47] thing
[1:09:49] simple for to will is present with me
[1:09:55] other words I want to do it I want to be
[1:09:57] right but how to perform that which is
[1:09:59] good I find
[1:10:02] not can't you see the struggle in your
[1:10:04] life every day and the problems of life
[1:10:07] and the troubles and the heartaches amen
[1:10:11] you get flustrated with the kids and you
[1:10:13] would grab one of them up and spank it
[1:10:14] you you get flustrated C somebody run
[1:10:17] you off the road you
[1:10:20] you you know somebody chew you out at
[1:10:24] the grocery store because
[1:10:26] you stepped in a line or
[1:10:34] something and the human part of you
[1:10:36] don't stand there and say I'm going to
[1:10:38] I'm
[1:10:43] sweet no there's something inside of me
[1:10:46] has to say hey boy you don't supposed to
[1:10:49] act like
[1:10:51] that right not outside of me cuz outside
[1:10:55] of me wants to act like
[1:10:58] that you're just not
[1:11:00] honest the biggest
[1:11:04] problem I didn't hit anybody in the nose
[1:11:06] you know because of problems or whatever
[1:11:08] I step back give them the way do
[1:11:10] whatever but that little thing inside of
[1:11:12] me is the one that's taken care of it
[1:11:13] not
[1:11:18] me
[1:11:20] right
[1:11:22] now
[1:11:25] for the good that I would I do not but
[1:11:27] the evil which I would
[1:11:29] not that I
[1:11:33] do he's not talking about sinning as a
[1:11:36] sinner dranking too much or running
[1:11:39] around with women or you know gambling
[1:11:41] or something he's not talking about junk
[1:11:44] he's talking about normal things if you
[1:11:46] want me I'll find where brother brandham
[1:11:49] says it about this very scripture I
[1:11:51] could probably look in my Bible and give
[1:11:52] it to you where brother bman is
[1:11:54] explaining that on conduct order and
[1:11:56] Doctrine and he says mainly what he's
[1:11:58] talking about is like he said I promised
[1:12:01] him I'd be at church tonight he said but
[1:12:03] when I come in I was just worh SL
[1:12:06] out see the things that I would I
[1:12:11] don't he's not talking about living as a
[1:12:15] devil and
[1:12:17] sin he said but I promised I'd be down
[1:12:20] here to
[1:12:22] service that's what he's explaining Paul
[1:12:25] talking
[1:12:28] about Paul gets a little upset with
[1:12:30] Peter one time don't
[1:12:32] he he said Peter why are you acting like
[1:12:37] that you trying to teach them Gentiles
[1:12:40] out there to act this way and you hear
[1:12:41] you acting this
[1:12:43] way he might have raised his voice at
[1:12:47] him he wouldn't take who was it John
[1:12:49] Mark which one was it that one one of
[1:12:52] the two that Paul wouldn't take with him
[1:12:57] Mark but later on he said tell him come
[1:13:00] on you know I kind of got over my part
[1:13:04] and he's got over his by now tell him
[1:13:05] come
[1:13:12] on see we think that being a Christian
[1:13:14] is
[1:13:17] walking nothing don't bother
[1:13:19] me
[1:13:20] well I wish it was out way but I the
[1:13:23] only problem is I'd have trouble
[1:13:24] following
[1:13:28] it I just try to be what I am you know
[1:13:32] by doing that I can say I'm
[1:13:35] sorry you
[1:13:40] know but if I do that I would not it is
[1:13:43] no more I that do it but sin that
[1:13:44] dwelleth in
[1:13:46] me and Paul are you just a rank Center
[1:13:49] no
[1:13:50] no this outside man of me is still got
[1:13:54] problems right troubles and
[1:13:59] heartaches it's not that we just live
[1:14:01] like the devil and claimed to be a
[1:14:03] Christian that's not supposed to be I
[1:14:05] find in a
[1:14:07] law that's not just Ten Commandments
[1:14:10] right
[1:14:12] right right I find in a
[1:14:15] law I find a balance or a position or
[1:14:21] something that when I would do good
[1:14:25] Evil's present with
[1:14:28] me
[1:14:30] right I've always told you and it ain't
[1:14:33] no joke about it but I always told you
[1:14:35] you could go give away people a million
[1:14:37] dollars to
[1:14:40] people and you know in another day or
[1:14:42] two they' be run I got to go pay taxes
[1:14:45] on this
[1:14:50] now man back when we used to make $2,000
[1:14:54] a year you know and that
[1:14:55] was that's all we
[1:14:59] made and I remember richer people you
[1:15:02] know they' GP about all the taxes they
[1:15:04] had to
[1:15:06] pay I paid more taxes than you drawed
[1:15:09] the whole
[1:15:10] year I said I'd like to do
[1:15:13] that
[1:15:15] yeah cuz that would mean I had to make
[1:15:17] at least
[1:15:19] 20,000 you know and here I am making two
[1:15:24] come on
[1:15:30] right I find a law that when I would do
[1:15:34] good evil is
[1:15:36] press for I Delight in the law of God
[1:15:40] what the law of
[1:15:44] God is that the Ten Commandments dos and
[1:15:46] don'ts and
[1:15:48] regulations he's not saying that about
[1:15:51] that is he he said I Delight in the law
[1:15:53] of
[1:15:56] God after the inward
[1:16:02] man not the outward he just got too sad
[1:16:05] he's having
[1:16:06] troubles but I see another law in my
[1:16:09] members Waring against the law of my
[1:16:14] mind and bringing me into captivity to
[1:16:17] the law of sin which is in my
[1:16:22] members
[1:16:25] well not Paul it sound like you're just
[1:16:27] a sinner he'd say Amen I'm a sinner
[1:16:30] saved by
[1:16:35] grace all
[1:16:40] right in my
[1:16:43] body I'm going to get to this in a
[1:16:47] second we're human and we're mortal and
[1:16:52] we're you know we're
[1:16:55] carnal all right no because that's what
[1:16:58] we are and we're subject to this
[1:17:02] world no matter how much you're a
[1:17:04] Christian and what you are you're
[1:17:06] subject to this world you got to eat you
[1:17:09] got to sleep you got to work you got to
[1:17:10] pay
[1:17:12] taxes right yes sir come
[1:17:20] on the law of sin which is in my m
[1:17:23] members not after the inward man he just
[1:17:26] got through saying that he delighted
[1:17:27] after the law of the inward
[1:17:30] man so what of members is he talking
[1:17:36] about the body and the
[1:17:38] spirit
[1:17:40] okay look what he says about it oh
[1:17:44] Wretched Man that I
[1:17:48] am after he's born
[1:17:51] again crying out out and says who shall
[1:17:54] deliver
[1:17:55] me from the body of this
[1:18:01] death
[1:18:07] now John on
[1:18:13] patmas saw a man
[1:18:16] lost he was crying out for a redeemer
[1:18:20] right you agree right
[1:18:24] he wanted a redeemer to come a lamb to
[1:18:29] come now may I say
[1:18:35] something oh Wretched Man that I
[1:18:40] am will it ever come to a
[1:18:46] time that this body that I'm living
[1:18:51] in that will go by the
[1:18:55] grave cuz he knew his Rapture wasn't
[1:18:57] coming brother R said Paul was trying to
[1:19:00] get it out of their mind that the
[1:19:01] Rapture was coming right
[1:19:05] then said is there a
[1:19:08] possibility that
[1:19:10] somebody will reach a place in
[1:19:14] faith that will be able to draw me out
[1:19:16] of the
[1:19:18] Grave cuz you see if they're not brought
[1:19:20] out of the Grave they are still under
[1:19:26] death
[1:19:28] right oh Wretched Man that I am who
[1:19:31] shall deliver me from the body of this
[1:19:34] death he knew he was having a lot of
[1:19:37] troubles in the natural and wanted to be
[1:19:39] delivered right right
[1:19:41] then but don't you think he's pointing
[1:19:43] down to a time that he really wanted to
[1:19:45] be totally
[1:19:50] delivered a resurrection would
[1:19:54] come I thank God through Jesus Christ
[1:19:57] Our
[1:20:03] Lord oh Wretched Man that I am is it a
[1:20:06] possibility that anybody could ever
[1:20:08] reach a place to draw me from the
[1:20:12] grave I thank God through Jesus Christ
[1:20:16] it will
[1:20:19] come in the end
[1:20:21] time
[1:20:23] so what are you going to do
[1:20:28] Paul what are you going to do
[1:20:33] Paul so then with the
[1:20:36] mind I myself serve the law of God
[1:20:39] that's not the
[1:20:41] brain that's the mind and of Christ
[1:20:43] being in you make you a new creature
[1:20:45] that's not the soul that's soul that's
[1:20:47] not
[1:20:48] brain all
[1:20:51] right so then with a mind until
[1:20:54] something takes place to remove me from
[1:20:56] this condition I'm in I will with my
[1:20:59] mind my the inward
[1:21:02] man I will serve
[1:21:04] God but with the
[1:21:07] flesh the law of
[1:21:10] sin not to be a sinner that he had to
[1:21:15] sin I'll just be part of
[1:21:20] this I'll just be part of this until it
[1:21:22] comes
[1:21:23] takes
[1:21:26] place see then what are
[1:21:29] we we say but brother Dale after the New
[1:21:32] Birth we're not under the
[1:21:35] law I don't understand what you're
[1:21:37] talking
[1:21:38] about we are under the
[1:21:42] law of the human body and
[1:21:47] spirit we're only free in the
[1:21:50] Soul by the new birth
[1:21:56] this flesh is holding
[1:22:01] me Romans 7:25 there says I thank God
[1:22:05] through Jesus Christ Our Lord so with
[1:22:07] the mind I myself serve the law of God
[1:22:11] but with the flesh the law of sin not
[1:22:15] that he had to sin as some say I can't
[1:22:18] help
[1:22:20] it Jesus said we could and he proved it
[1:22:26] right but Paul was saying I'm in a
[1:22:30] carnal
[1:22:32] atmosphere subject to this carnal things
[1:22:36] of
[1:22:38] carnality you know
[1:22:41] life it would be great if we Christians
[1:22:44] were living in a
[1:22:51] cubicle
[1:22:53] what about those people down through
[1:22:54] there that had to give their life for
[1:22:56] the
[1:23:00] gospel Paul said I have the mind of
[1:23:04] Christ that's the new
[1:23:07] birth but I need something to help me
[1:23:09] with this Old Law of the sin of death as
[1:23:13] long as we're in this flesh we're going
[1:23:15] to be controlled to a degree by the
[1:23:18] flesh number four we'll try to
[1:23:21] hurry
[1:23:24] Corinthians 1 Corinthians 7:
[1:23:27] 32-34 but I would have you with uh uh
[1:23:30] would have you without
[1:23:32] carefulness he that is unmarried carried
[1:23:34] for the things that belong to the Lord
[1:23:37] out that he may please the Lord but he
[1:23:39] that is married cared for the things
[1:23:41] that are of the world he may please his
[1:23:46] wife all right there is difference
[1:23:50] between a wife and a vir
[1:23:53] virgin the unmarried woman virgin aren't
[1:23:56] she cares for the things of the Lord
[1:23:59] that she may be holy both in body and in
[1:24:01] spirit but she that is married cares for
[1:24:04] the things of the world now she may
[1:24:07] please her
[1:24:08] husband just showing you the point that
[1:24:11] no matter how much we think we're not in
[1:24:13] this world we're still in this world and
[1:24:16] there's nothing wrong with
[1:24:18] it in the right
[1:24:21] order I love to
[1:24:26] eat
[1:24:29] yeah most everybody in here goes along
[1:24:32] with that there's a couple of skinny
[1:24:37] ones Joyce and
[1:24:41] Julie sister Monica she's holding on
[1:24:45] we'll get her out of if you stay around
[1:24:46] here a
[1:24:49] while
[1:24:50] right do you understand understand the
[1:24:53] point Paul is illustrating what I'm
[1:24:54] using it
[1:24:55] for as long as we're in this life we're
[1:24:58] bound to this life we got to work for a
[1:25:00] living got to pay taxes we got to send
[1:25:03] our kids to school or homeschool thems
[1:25:05] or whatever we do we got certain rules
[1:25:08] and regulation certain laws that we must
[1:25:10] abide by well there's anything wrong
[1:25:12] with that
[1:25:15] no it's a good
[1:25:18] life but the flesh will always let lean
[1:25:22] to the works of the
[1:25:25] law or the
[1:25:28] letter and then we'll look at what each
[1:25:30] other
[1:25:35] does do you see that girl had that dress
[1:25:42] on now I'm a human being and I hope you
[1:25:46] understand adult
[1:25:51] talking but but when you keep
[1:25:52] emphasizing so much about what somebody
[1:25:56] wires you
[1:26:01] know you might turn that into
[1:26:07] lust
[1:26:11] right
[1:26:13] okay but you see that's what we do
[1:26:15] because newborn babies are newly born
[1:26:18] babies you know they look at the DS and
[1:26:19] the don'ts and the things you said you
[1:26:22] calling us newborn babies well that's
[1:26:23] better than calling you
[1:26:26] Sinners okay better than saying you're
[1:26:30] lost that's but you start out looking at
[1:26:33] what people
[1:26:35] do and what they don't
[1:26:37] do and even shake my hand there
[1:26:40] something wrong maybe he's mad at
[1:26:47] me
[1:26:49] right they didn't even speak to me
[1:26:53] what did you speak to them no I wanted
[1:26:56] them speak
[1:26:57] first good
[1:26:59] kid we laughed yesterday coming back
[1:27:02] from down the road with Abby and Richard
[1:27:05] they both got into that Taurus
[1:27:07] thing arguing with each other about over
[1:27:10] a little old ball
[1:27:11] and I ain't letting you have it let me
[1:27:15] have that ball they just fussing like
[1:27:18] crazy but Abby finally give in said here
[1:27:20] Daddy you can have it
[1:27:23] but
[1:27:26] listen Israel wanted something to do I'm
[1:27:29] not getting along too
[1:27:32] good go to number five let's get a
[1:27:34] couple of quotes and then we'll try to
[1:27:36] just sum it
[1:27:37] up number five is the mark of the beast
[1:27:39] preached in 1956
[1:27:43] 75 dear God just as a poet wrote there
[1:27:46] is a fountain filled with blood drawn
[1:27:48] from emanuel's Vine we realize that the
[1:27:50] kingdom of God is not what what we eat
[1:27:52] or drink or wearing of a
[1:27:56] pearl we realize that God we don't stop
[1:28:00] this and stop wearing
[1:28:02] this and that to make us
[1:28:06] different we don't stop this and stop
[1:28:10] that to make us different
[1:28:15] right but when the spirit of Christ
[1:28:17] comes in it does that
[1:28:20] itself right
[1:28:23] it's not what we
[1:28:25] do but what he
[1:28:28] does what he
[1:28:31] does all right look at the next
[1:28:35] one taking from the message mzc great
[1:28:38] Prince and King 5510 109 morning service
[1:28:43] and the Covenant was given to Abraham
[1:28:47] unconditionally not Abraham if you'll do
[1:28:49] something I'll do this but have already
[1:28:52] done
[1:28:55] it see it isn't what we do it's what he
[1:28:59] has done for us nothing we could do to
[1:29:02] Merit
[1:29:03] anything who could we the unrighteous
[1:29:07] ones ever do anything to Merit something
[1:29:09] before the great Jehovah God and his
[1:29:11] great Supreme
[1:29:14] Holiness watch now we only thing we can
[1:29:18] do is
[1:29:20] accept and be grateful ful for what he
[1:29:22] has already done for
[1:29:25] us oh that's so simple isn't it and I'm
[1:29:28] positive that many times in people's
[1:29:30] thinking that we try to make Divine
[1:29:32] Healing and so forth some great Outreach
[1:29:35] something way
[1:29:39] away if I could only reach
[1:29:44] it you see what he
[1:29:47] saying if I could do
[1:29:50] something and do it it but it won't
[1:29:55] work Paul Romans 8:7 says because the
[1:29:59] carnal mind is at enmity against God for
[1:30:03] it is not subject to the law of God and
[1:30:05] neither indeed can
[1:30:07] be but to be carnally minded he says is
[1:30:10] death to be spiritually minded is
[1:30:14] life Paul in 1 Corinthians
[1:30:18] 9:27 he said but I keep under my body in
[1:30:20] other words I keep my body under this is
[1:30:22] the way it's stating it but I keep under
[1:30:25] my body and bring it into
[1:30:28] subjection that's the whole goal of the
[1:30:30] Christian attitude right one last
[1:30:36] point the law is the letter of the
[1:30:40] Bible and what we need is the new
[1:30:43] birth to interpret that we'll get to
[1:30:45] that next
[1:30:47] week or else we'll be like all before us
[1:30:53] even the Pharisees who said to
[1:30:57] Jesus John
[1:31:00] 9:28 about the blind
[1:31:02] man they said to the blind man you're
[1:31:05] one of his
[1:31:08] disciples but we are Moses
[1:31:13] disciples we do what Moses
[1:31:17] said people today say we hunted and fish
[1:31:19] with the prophet
[1:31:22] they can tell you everything he
[1:31:26] said but Paul said in Acts 19
[1:31:29] and2 have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:31:31] since you
[1:31:38] believed in other words you got to First
[1:31:40] believe the letter of the
[1:31:43] word the law if you want to make me to
[1:31:46] use the
[1:31:48] word the letter of God's word you must
[1:31:51] receive that from first then the Holy
[1:31:53] Spirit can come and Quicken what you've
[1:31:57] held is that the promise that Jesus told
[1:32:00] him said I bring to you remembrance
[1:32:01] whatsoever I've said and teach you
[1:32:03] things to come he said Not only did he
[1:32:05] bring to what remembrance was that even
[1:32:07] taught him further on the
[1:32:16] Revelation then to start the
[1:32:20] thought
[1:32:22] that we must be born
[1:32:26] again and that will start the thought of
[1:32:29] being born
[1:32:32] again will start the point of thinking
[1:32:35] that we can come to a place to be
[1:32:37] totally
[1:32:41] dead and Paul sums it up and says not in
[1:32:44] the oldness of the
[1:32:50] letter what about
[1:32:53] it do we think we've been something that
[1:32:56] there a reason God saved us you think
[1:32:58] we're in this message because we're
[1:33:00] smart we've intelligent we've
[1:33:04] learned
[1:33:10] no you say is there any hopes brother
[1:33:13] Dale have ever overcome in this
[1:33:17] flesh when a change comes it will take
[1:33:19] care of
[1:33:20] that but we don't have to yield to the
[1:33:24] flesh now I hope you understand what I
[1:33:27] got through I went through all of it
[1:33:29] with that a man had to be concerned
[1:33:30] about his wife and to be this that the
[1:33:33] other the Bible says not even to fast
[1:33:35] unless it be with
[1:33:38] consent but the Devil tempt you for your
[1:33:48] inconsistency we're being set
[1:33:50] free
[1:33:54] death is slowly being annihilated even
[1:33:57] though we're getting older
[1:34:00] right
[1:34:02] right because the more the word is
[1:34:04] revealed the more death is being
[1:34:07] destroyed that's
[1:34:11] right there is no death in the new
[1:34:14] birth but it takes a death to get it
[1:34:17] that's
[1:34:19] right there is no one alive
[1:34:23] now listen to what say there's no one
[1:34:25] alive that's got the new
[1:34:29] birth did you understand that
[1:34:31] one if you're dead you can have the new
[1:34:34] birth you can't have the new birth while
[1:34:35] you're alive
[1:34:38] right so then we're to die out to
[1:34:41] ourselves and be born
[1:34:47] again being set free come on
[1:34:50] musicians being set
[1:34:57] free a process it starts by the new
[1:35:02] birth and will
[1:35:05] continue until the change of the
[1:35:09] body I
[1:35:12] believe then we can say we're
[1:35:19] free but what about those early cre
[1:35:22] Christians so much in Christ until they
[1:35:24] offered
[1:35:26] them in those Arenas and things they
[1:35:28] offered them to be set
[1:35:30] free if they just recant from their
[1:35:33] belief in Jesus
[1:35:36] Christ they wouldn't do
[1:35:41] it they walked into death and was so
[1:35:45] Gallant in doing it until it's recorded
[1:35:48] that even sometimes the soldiers that
[1:35:50] was leading them are driving them into
[1:35:52] the arena would just throw down their
[1:35:55] weapons and walk in with
[1:35:58] them they saw something that was
[1:36:06] real I like that song He's still working
[1:36:09] on
[1:36:11] me what we got brother let's stand
[1:36:14] number
[1:36:19] 9 too sad is
[1:36:23] fire that longing in
[1:36:30] your the
[1:36:33] whole anybody have a
[1:36:40] need find true
[1:36:50] satisfaction
[1:37:03] going to be going to see a friend that's
[1:37:05] dying with cancer out in
[1:37:08] Colorado so let's just send a prayer
[1:37:12] CLA let's believe that when she gets
[1:37:15] there it'll all be taken care of do you
[1:37:19] believe it see that's looking P
[1:37:24] death science says you got cancer you're
[1:37:30] dying but the Bible says he that is
[1:37:35] alive so let's believe it father we send

[1:38:18] people that will become the word of God
[1:38:21] and walk up to death and just walk
[1:38:23] straight through
[1:38:28] it because he said it you know it's not
[1:38:32] going to be them it's going to be
[1:38:34] him fulfilling his
[1:38:38] word we're not something special in the
