[3:49] tonight bless each one but we just look
[3:52] unto you we give you thanks for all
[3:54] things we know it all comes from you in
[3:56] Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[4:00] Hebrews 1 verse1 says God who at sunred
[4:03] times and in diverse manner spank in
[4:05] times past un the fathers by the
[4:08] prophets hath in these last days spoken
[4:10] unto us by his son whom he hath
[4:12] appointed heir of All Things by whom
[4:15] also he made the
[4:17] worlds who being the brightness of his
[4:20] glory and the express image of his
[4:22] person and upholding All Things by the
[4:24] word of his power when he had by himself
[4:27] purged our sins sat down on the right
[4:29] hand of the Majesty on high being made
[4:32] so much more better than the angels as
[4:34] he ha by inheritance obtained a more
[4:37] excellent Name than they For unto which
[4:40] of the Angels said he at any time Thou
[4:44] Art my son this day have I begotten thee
[4:46] and again I will be to him a father and
[4:49] he shall be to me a son and again when
[4:52] he bringeth in the first begotten into
[4:55] the world he saith and let all the
[4:59] angels of God worship Him and of the
[5:02] angels He saith who maketh his angels
[5:05] spirits and his ministers a flame of
[5:08] fire but unto the son he saith thy
[5:11] Throne oh God is forever and ever a
[5:14] scepter of righteousness is the scepter
[5:16] of thy
[5:17] kingdom thou Hast loved righteousness
[5:20] and hated iniquity therefore God even
[5:23] thy God hath anointed thee with the oil
[5:25] of gladness above thy fellows and thou
[5:28] Lord in the beginning H has laid the
[5:30] foundation of the earth and the heavens
[5:33] are the works of thy hands they Shall
[5:35] Perish but thou remainest and they all
[5:38] shall wax old as doth a garment and as a
[5:41] vesture shall thou fold them up and they
[5:44] shall be changed but Thou Art the same
[5:47] and thy years shall not
[5:49] fail but to them to but to which of the
[5:52] Angels said he at any time sit on my
[5:55] right hand until I make thine enemies
[5:57] thine enemies thy foot stol are they not
[5:59] all ministering Spirits sent forth to
[6:01] minister for them who are who shall be
[6:06] Heirs of Salvation amen may be seated
[6:09] Lord add his Blessing to the reading of
[6:12] the
[6:13] word and uh can somebody get me some
[6:16] water I a tell you right now I'm going
[6:18] to need
[6:19] some but uh been
[6:23] enjoying what Brother D has been
[6:25] speaking on that's right because you
[6:28] know we understand the the whole the
[6:30] whole Bible the whole
[6:33] uh Capstone Revelation right is one God
[6:38] right and you know brother bam said you
[6:40] know we you know if we see who he is we
[6:42] see we are see ourselves amen because
[6:45] you know that's who we that's who we are
[6:47] we are we are a part of him and we can
[6:49] see we see who he is and we see who we
[6:51] are right because if you can't see
[6:55] yourself in the scripture you have to
[6:56] see him and you have to see
[7:00] when he reveals himself and he's
[7:01] revealing because he's going to reveal
[7:02] you because you're going to make him
[7:04] known he's going to make you known
[7:06] that's right but you're going to have
[7:07] because he's going to make
[7:09] you see who you are but you're going to
[7:12] see who he is right and so even and the
[7:17] even as brother R talked about
[7:19] understanding
[7:21] that when he when he
[7:23] started you know he said all that God
[7:26] was he poured into Christ and all that
[7:29] Christ was was he poured into the
[7:31] church and so we can see we have to see
[7:35] who we are but we see we see him amen
[7:39] and so looking here in the in the
[7:43] scripture okay I try not try not to bump
[7:46] into it or kick it or anything yeah for
[7:48] the video
[7:50] okay say I'm well that' be better cuz
[7:54] I'm right-handed so so I have to get on
[7:57] that side but uh any
[8:00] anyway the thought that I have tonight
[8:02] that that I want to speak on is I want
[8:05] to speak
[8:07] on the the essence of
[8:10] God
[8:12] and
[8:14] uh you know we we know that brother vom
[8:16] said that God didn't change in his
[8:18] essence or his or his behavior right
[8:25] ex and so that scripture here when I was
[8:29] when I
[8:31] was because that was that was the word
[8:34] that came to me was Essence yeah and
[8:37] what does Essence mean well
[8:39] and
[8:41] so if we
[8:47] um hold on let me
[8:51] see here it is yall just have to pray
[8:54] for now I've got everything jumbled up
[8:56] this you know cuz I've I've went over
[8:58] this thing about fearful four times so
[9:00] I'm I'm going to have to look at try to
[9:02] figure out where things are at cuz
[9:03] they're not in the same order as they
[9:05] were before but Essence the definition
[9:08] of essence is the attribute or set of
[9:11] attributes that make an object or
[9:13] substance what it fundamentally is and
[9:16] which it has by necessity and without it
[9:20] it loses its identity Essence is
[9:23] contrasted with
[9:26] accident and so it says a property which
[9:28] the the
[9:30] uh the the property that the object or
[9:34] substance has
[9:36] contingently without which the substance
[9:38] can still retain its identity right
[9:40] exactly so we want to look at the what
[9:44] what Essence is and know a lot of people
[9:46] think of essence as alcohol or they
[9:49] think of it as the
[9:51] perfume or something like that because
[9:53] they think of that that is or they think
[9:54] it it's just the fundamental part of
[9:57] of uh of something right but actually
[10:01] when you look at it in U in a in a
[10:06] philosophical way in a scientific way
[10:09] when you deal with the essence of
[10:10] something you're actually looking at all
[10:12] of the attributes that make up the
[10:14] object or the substance whatever it is
[10:17] and so that's how it's defined as the
[10:19] whole and it says it has to have this by
[10:21] necessity right because if it doesn't
[10:24] have one of these uh characteristics or
[10:27] properties then it's not what it is
[10:29] right and it also says without it it
[10:33] loses its identity so um one of the
[10:35] examples that it that it gives when I
[10:38] was looking this up was it talks about
[10:39] like a chair now we you know we we have
[10:42] a chair and we all know have an idea
[10:44] what a chair is a chair has a seat it
[10:47] has legs and it has a back to it
[10:51] now we all you know in the South M you
[10:55] know we always say have a
[10:57] seat we don't say have a chair
[10:59] right right I have a bench but it all
[11:03] but a chair has those has those
[11:05] characteristics now when we speak of
[11:07] chair you know a chair can be made out
[11:08] of plastic a chair can be made out of
[11:11] wood but when you but when you define
[11:14] that chair as one as a as a certain
[11:19] characteristic when as and and just
[11:22] going back to what Brother D always talk
[11:23] about he said when you start in Genesis
[11:25] with a white dog you have to end with a
[11:28] white dog in Revel
[11:29] when you end you have the same when you
[11:33] what it is in the beginning has to the
[11:35] same all the way through so if you
[11:37] decide if you define the chair as being
[11:40] wood then it doesn't matter if it's made
[11:42] of plastic or anything else if it's not
[11:44] wood right or if it's a polymer y a
[11:48] press board material that has that's
[11:51] well sure it's got wood in but it's got
[11:53] a lot of glue in it but it's not but if
[11:55] you have a just a wood chair and you
[11:58] define it as wood good if it has a
[12:00] padded seat then it's not the chair
[12:03] right because it because it has changed
[12:06] in its in its uh attributes it's
[12:08] changing the characteristics of what
[12:10] identifies it as that chair right so
[12:12] when you take the when you have a one
[12:14] chair and you have that and then when
[12:16] you take away the back of it it still
[12:18] has legs and it still has a seat but you
[12:20] no longer have a chair you still have a
[12:22] place to sit but you got a stool right
[12:25] right that's right you don't have a
[12:28] chair
[12:30] good good and then if you have if you
[12:32] leave the back but you take the leg away
[12:34] the legs then you don't have a chair you
[12:36] have a seat yeah right because you know
[12:39] that's what they because you don't have
[12:40] a you don't take a bleacher chair to the
[12:42] bleachers it's a bleacher seat
[12:46] right because what is it it's a padded
[12:48] it's a padded bottom and a back to right
[12:52] and so it it's identified by its
[12:54] characteristics so if it loses a
[12:56] characteristic then it loses its
[12:57] identity right so when you when you
[13:00] think about what the essence of it is
[13:02] it's not just the not always it's is it
[13:06] considered it's fun just the fundamental
[13:08] part of it because if you because you
[13:11] sometimes people think it was just the
[13:12] one characteristic but it's also it's
[13:15] the whole characteristic because every
[13:16] part of it makes it what it is right
[13:18] right and so we take we look at the
[13:21] essence
[13:23] of an
[13:24] object or of a person and and we look
[13:28] here and the the reason I chose this
[13:30] scripture was because in the in the
[13:33] looking
[13:34] through looking through the scripture to
[13:38] understand what what the essence of of
[13:42] something was when when you're reading
[13:43] the Scripture it brings you to Hebrews
[13:45] 1:3 because when it talks about and this
[13:48] is the definition I found when it when
[13:50] it talks about and the express image of
[13:52] his person when you look that up one of
[13:55] the translations is the very expression
[13:59] of the essence of God
[14:01] right the very expression of the essence
[14:04] of God so when he was speaking of the
[14:07] son y so when the sun came into
[14:10] existence the sun was the very
[14:13] expression amen exactly because even in
[14:16] Colossians 1 when he talks about he be
[14:18] he was the visible right of the
[14:20] invisible God why because he was
[14:23] invisible to us but that didn't mean
[14:26] that he didn't exist right right because
[14:30] I hope I hope because there's a few
[14:32] things I want to talk about tonight the
[14:33] reason I want to use this forward and I
[14:35] hope when I get into this because
[14:37] there's a few things I want I want to
[14:38] show you some of them are scientific
[14:40] some of them are
[14:42] mathematical and don't don't everybody
[14:43] just don't go lose lose me just cuz I
[14:47] say that but if you can
[14:51] understand and I hope I can express it
[14:55] Bless but if you can see
[14:59] who he is that's it right when he where
[15:02] he started amen when he start when he
[15:04] started as
[15:07] Elohim and if he if he's not if he
[15:10] doesn't change he has the same Essence
[15:13] then who is here today
[15:15] right and and we we see who we are but
[15:19] we can see who he is right and you know
[15:22] brother R in the in the pergam church
[15:24] age he also he said you know he says
[15:26] that Jesus was the express image of God
[15:29] the scripture tells us that he was the
[15:30] express image he was the essence of God
[15:34] exactly and so we understand what was
[15:36] what was the essence that came
[15:39] out in the
[15:46] beginning because I I want to show you
[15:51] something and this I don't know how long
[15:53] this is going to take me
[15:55] so y'all just pray for me
[16:01] but uh I got I got two or three drawings
[16:05] on and we won't get to them all at once
[16:08] but y'all just pray for
[16:12] me but
[16:14] uh I hope y'all can see this this
[16:23] going everybody see
[16:26] that everybody know what this ISS
[16:32] the number line everybody use that in
[16:34] school remember that you got one and you
[16:38] add two to it two three so
[16:42] you okay everybody understand that good
[16:47] okay
[16:50] now when we speak of when we speak of
[16:52] the assets of God and he come
[16:55] in Jesus was the essence of God
[16:58] beginning he was the self-existing he
[17:01] was Elohim so we know they started out
[17:03] he was Elohim and so then he said what
[17:07] came forth from him was the sun amen
[17:10] right amen the sun came forth right
[17:13] exactly now brother brandham
[17:16] said in several places he said all that
[17:19] God was he poured into Christ right
[17:22] that's right all that Christ was he
[17:23] poured into the church amen now Jehovah
[17:26] Gyra number one 1964 brother Brenham
[17:29] said
[17:31] everything everything that was in God
[17:34] God poured into Christ right right and
[17:36] then he said everything that was in
[17:38] Christ he poured into the believer right
[17:43] amen so everything and everybody you
[17:46] know brother always says all means all
[17:49] all that God was he poured in Christ all
[17:53] okay how there's there's M multitude of
[17:57] quotes that we can look at
[17:59] but take my word for it cuz you can find
[18:01] it CU Brother D gave it to you before
[18:02] right God is
[18:05] infinite exactly right God is infinite
[18:07] got it
[18:08] amen and that's what I want to show you
[18:10] I want to show you I want to explain
[18:12] something about to about Infinity to you
[18:15] does anybody understand what Infinity is
[18:16] mathematical concept scientific concept
[18:19] of
[18:20] unlimitless right
[18:24] exactly okay the simplest form we deal
[18:27] with is a number line
[18:30] and we know
[18:31] that we go to Infinity on the number
[18:34] line go as far as you want to right you
[18:37] can go Millions trions quintillion on
[18:41] that's as far as I go past trions I
[18:43] don't know any the rest of them but
[18:44] there's a bunch of them you can look
[18:45] them up and then we know there's a
[18:46] negative in Infinity over
[18:50] here as far as you go that way you go
[18:52] that way
[18:54] right you go as far as you go in the
[18:56] future you go in the back amen
[18:59] and so we know that as far as you go
[19:02] here you go here it's in it's infinite
[19:05] there's there's not there's so when we
[19:07] deal with we talk about God being
[19:09] Limitless being infinite when we reach
[19:12] here we talk about infinite
[19:16] infinity and so we see there's numbers
[19:19] you can't
[19:20] count right what happens if you divide
[19:22] infinity and
[19:26] half Infinity amen
[19:30] if you divide Infinity by Infinity what
[19:32] do you
[19:34] have Infinity you can't you can't
[19:37] because you can't limit what it is so
[19:41] when you when you say that something
[19:42] that has reached infinity or you know
[19:45] that has Infinity then no matter what
[19:47] you do to it it's infin it's infinite
[19:50] right in science they'll tell you that
[19:52] you know we have two
[19:57] objects that have that
[19:59] have
[20:01] magnetism we see we see that in in space
[20:05] two objects pulling against each other
[20:07] because they're attracted to each other
[20:09] right
[20:10] right now I just this something brother
[20:13] talked about when he talked about
[20:14] magnetism here's a
[20:17] magnet and you know it has all the
[20:21] little the field all around it where's
[20:25] the strongest point and where's the
[20:27] weakest point I should say where's the
[20:28] weakest Point where's the weakest point
[20:30] at in a in a magnet it's in the
[20:34] middle there's that's that's the weakest
[20:38] point now when we talk about in Infinity
[20:42] just to give you a couple of ideas about
[20:45] things and
[20:46] Concepts when you when you look at the
[20:50] these two
[20:51] planets see science can tell us that we
[20:53] can look and see because we use it all
[20:55] the time when we send up a satellite we
[20:58] use the gravitational pull of planets
[21:02] right as a swingshot y right because as
[21:06] they come around the around the planet
[21:09] the the field actually causes them as
[21:11] they come into that orbit it speeds them
[21:14] up when they go past it and it's a
[21:16] slingshot it sends them out faster and
[21:19] so uh when when you're looking at this
[21:21] Force when you're looking at this field
[21:23] this magnetism see we see this and and I
[21:26] just want you to see this as an analogy
[21:28] here we see this in the
[21:31] heavens we see we see the the planets
[21:33] having pull on each other all the things
[21:35] that happen in the heavens are based on
[21:38] the gravitational pull right
[21:41] right and see we don't see that and in
[21:44] our human element here yeah because
[21:46] we're living in the negative right
[21:48] exactly see if we understand and if we
[21:51] and this is like extremely large and if
[21:54] this is extremely small let's let's go
[21:57] down and you look at a
[22:01] atom and I'm not going to
[22:04] draw but you know we have a nucleus and
[22:07] we
[22:09] have everybody remembers that from
[22:11] science yeah yeah protons neutrons and
[22:15] you got an
[22:17] electron see we understand
[22:20] that and you know Neil boore had the had
[22:23] the basic concept now they have it it's
[22:26] so hard to understand with all the
[22:27] orbitals and everything that they have
[22:30] figured out that uh electrons move in a
[22:33] in an atom that it's just you know it's
[22:35] more than most people's mind can handle
[22:38] but when you when you look at that
[22:40] electron is moving around that atom
[22:43] right you know there was a man from NASA
[22:46] said one time as a a scientist from
[22:51] NASA and and just to give you just to
[22:53] give you the understanding of the size
[22:55] of this when I was in school they told
[22:57] us that if you could Elevate the nucleus
[23:00] of an atom to the size of a speck of
[23:03] dust the electron that's floating off of
[23:05] that thing in the veent Shell which is
[23:07] the most outer
[23:09] ring that thing would be miles and miles
[23:12] and miles away from the
[23:16] nucleus so you can imagine and those
[23:18] things I mean it's I me it's minuscule
[23:21] the size of that that's right but that
[23:23] electron is being controlled by that
[23:25] right oh yeah that far away yep and we
[23:28] see and they they told us the N the
[23:30] scientists told us because if you look
[23:32] at the distance here that that has an
[23:35] effect on the
[23:38] mass and I hope I hope y'all understand
[23:40] what I'm talking about the mass the the
[23:42] stuff that makes up something right you
[23:45] know it's just like you know the the
[23:47] question is you know what weighs more a
[23:48] pound of feathers or a pound of
[23:50] bricks you know they weigh the same
[23:52] because because the pounds are the same
[23:55] the question is is what's the mass of
[23:57] them if you to put a pound of bricks in
[24:00] a in a in a place of a pound of feathers
[24:03] you know you'd have a lot more feathers
[24:04] so it take up more space because there's
[24:06] more mass in the bricks because it's the
[24:08] way it's constructed it's made tighter
[24:11] together so that's the reason that uh
[24:15] when when we look at the distance here
[24:17] from the N from this nucleus to the
[24:19] electron when you look at the size of
[24:22] that the NASA scientist said if we could
[24:25] take the distance here and we could
[24:27] compact all of this
[24:29] into that area where it would be sitting
[24:32] compacted together this right here he
[24:34] said we could take all of the mass of
[24:37] the known universe the one what man
[24:40] knows the mass of the whole known
[24:42] universe he said you could pack it all
[24:44] into the size of a golf
[24:48] ball so you can understand how the
[24:51] distance is if we can understand how
[24:54] minute things are than you and that was
[24:57] spoken and put in place by the word of
[25:01] God right amen and it is controlled by
[25:04] the word of God and so all of that is
[25:07] being moved right right right and so we
[25:11] can see how Minal that is yet that is as
[25:14] as I believe brother man told us we'd be
[25:16] changing our atoms right absolutely amen
[25:19] and so there there's where it's going to
[25:21] be and see how my n that is but see we
[25:23] are living in the negative right that's
[25:26] right because we don't see that we don't
[25:28] see that pull while we living in a
[25:31] negative but we can see it on a on a
[25:33] very small scale if we look at it very
[25:35] minute things we can
[25:37] see an amazing thing taking place if we
[25:40] go into the heavens we can see amazing
[25:42] things take place but we don't see them
[25:43] where we're at because we're not looking
[25:47] right right come
[25:52] on because you know brother Brown I have
[25:54] that quote in here where brother Brown
[25:55] talks
[25:56] about another as time evangelism brother
[25:59] talks about you can't exhaust God that's
[26:01] right amen and he also
[26:04] says you know he talks about the little
[26:06] fish he said uh about swimming in the
[26:10] ocean he said you know I must drink
[26:12] sparing it might go dry sometime yeah or
[26:15] he's talking about the uh mouse eating
[26:17] in the in the uh garders of Egypt having
[26:21] to eat sparingly because we might not
[26:23] make it to the next Harvest yeah and you
[26:25] know he was talking about you know
[26:26] that's the way people look at it and he
[26:27] said
[26:29] Oh my he said that's trying to exhaust
[26:31] God's goodness and mercy to his people
[26:33] he wants to bless you he's ready he's
[26:35] pressing could you imagine taking all
[26:37] the waters in the Earth the Seas and
[26:39] everything and piling it into one 4ft
[26:42] pipe and putting it up there the
[26:44] pressure would be on the bottom of it
[26:45] trying to find a little crevice to leak
[26:47] its way through that's like the pressure
[26:49] of the Holy Ghost trying to come down on
[26:52] every life but he says but they won't do
[26:54] it they love crazing things better than
[26:56] they love God right
[26:58] mhm and so we can understand see we we
[27:01] we see that we're missing but he's
[27:04] moving right right
[27:08] exactly and we
[27:11] see now to give you so that gives you an
[27:14] I hope that gives you an idea of what
[27:16] what we're talking about when we talk
[27:17] about something being infinite yeah
[27:21] because even even this that that's not
[27:23] that's not infinite right that's right
[27:27] the mass the of that
[27:29] adom has a limit the distance of that
[27:33] thing has a limit so we can talk about
[27:36] these things being seeing how small they
[27:38] are and God controls that but he's he's
[27:41] greater than that righten that that is
[27:43] that is just a minute and we can see the
[27:45] things in the heavens and right you know
[27:49] we understand even when Einstein you
[27:51] brother Brown said that if we could you
[27:53] know if Einstein had the spiritual with
[27:55] the natural he could have really told us
[27:56] so because really understood those
[27:59] things and to understand that when
[28:02] Einstein was looking at when he was
[28:03] speaking on the theory of relativity and
[28:05] everything when you go back and study
[28:07] the things that he was talking about you
[28:08] know he was even talking about that we
[28:10] we think
[28:11] of I got I got to share this with you
[28:14] brother Brenham said the quote that
[28:15] brother Dale gave us uh watch off
[28:18] service he said can't you see God is
[28:21] covers all space fills all time and runs
[28:23] into eternity he said God cover when God
[28:27] who covers all space and all eternity
[28:31] now when when Einstein was looking you
[28:35] know he was he was realizing that light
[28:38] doesn't travel in a straight line right
[28:40] yeah he said because he could figure
[28:42] that one out but when he was looking at
[28:44] the when he was looking at this the
[28:46] objects the planets he could see the
[28:48] light was bending but even when he
[28:50] calculated he said it couldn't not be
[28:52] that the light was just being pulled by
[28:54] that gravitational pull of the of the
[28:56] planet right he actually discovered that
[29:02] space space itself had a force and that
[29:06] was what was causing because it was also
[29:08] pushing now listen this the fourth space
[29:11] was pushing on the light to bend the
[29:13] light around the around the planet and
[29:16] Not only was the force of this but there
[29:18] was something else there that was
[29:20] bending the light yeah amen and we think
[29:22] that space we look in space and we think
[29:24] it's nothing we think it's a vast
[29:26] emptiness a vast void and that's where
[29:28] God is because he said he took all of
[29:30] space so if he's there then see he was
[29:33] even controlling that right sureen see
[29:37] even even in the even in the scientific
[29:39] realm Einstein could prove that was
[29:41] something else because what else was
[29:43] there right right they stood there and
[29:45] said there's nothing there it's empty
[29:47] but that's where he was at yeah because
[29:50] he's there when when you don't think
[29:52] he's there that's where he's there amen
[29:54] that's where you find him
[29:56] amen yes sir
[29:59] see I didn't know y was going to get a
[30:00] science
[30:10] classad I got a couple other things I
[30:12] want to share with you when you speak on
[30:14] on on things being infinite going back
[30:16] to the number line here we know we've
[30:18] got infinite this way and we've got
[30:20] Infinity this way
[30:22] yeah but what we don't
[30:25] realize that's Infinity also absolutely
[30:28] yeah amen yes sir see when you when you
[30:31] look at this number line see we're
[30:32] always taught that this is a finite
[30:35] set we think it's one two but how many
[30:38] how many numbers fall between one and
[30:43] two one and a half one and a quarter you
[30:48] can divide that into thousands millions
[30:50] trillions
[30:54] klions as many as you divide in there
[30:56] you can still have more you can continue
[30:59] divide that and still have more right
[31:01] amen so when we look at God being
[31:04] infinite we say God God's
[31:07] infinite and see when you and when when
[31:10] I see we talking about infinite I also
[31:13] see
[31:14] Eternal right I can see that because
[31:17] brother Brandon said that all that God
[31:19] was he poured into Christ and he poured
[31:22] that into the believer right now and he
[31:25] said he said but he gave us a measure
[31:28] that's
[31:29] right exactly we were given a measure
[31:32] right just like he talking about the
[31:33] Spoonful of the ocean he said it was a
[31:36] same elements the same characteristics
[31:38] in that ocean spoonful of the ocean was
[31:41] also in the ocean and he said it wasn't
[31:43] he said it was not in quality it was
[31:46] because it's not in quantity it was in
[31:47] quality because you have the same thing
[31:49] and see you have a measure sure of
[31:54] eternal life right you have because see
[31:57] we think and and see if we understand
[32:00] that if we understand that because we
[32:01] look
[32:02] at
[32:04] um understand the vastness of it but if
[32:07] we can understand that's whatw dwells in
[32:09] us then when you see what dwells in you
[32:12] then you can understand why brother
[32:14] brandham said that we could we're
[32:16] creators amen exactly he said you had
[32:19] the you had the ability to speak a world
[32:21] and go live on right and if that because
[32:23] see it was a part right amen and see
[32:26] another thing is when you come down here
[32:28] and you see this this is where you're at
[32:31] in the negative right yeah and see as
[32:34] brother Donny was asking on W when he
[32:37] was doing the the questions see when you
[32:40] when you talk about
[32:44] negative -3 is is more positive than -4
[32:48] right yeah because you're moving in a
[32:50] positive direction right right and so
[32:53] yeah so when you go forward yeah it's
[32:55] negative but it's positive because you
[32:57] receed the positive but it's still
[32:59] negative because as soon as you reach
[33:02] here then guess what youve got to go on
[33:04] so this right here is is the negative of
[33:06] the positive and so you move on from
[33:08] here and you keep moving so it doesn't
[33:09] matter how far you go even you know
[33:11] because when you reach four then the
[33:13] next number is five because we got to
[33:14] keep continuing on this is the negative
[33:16] of five and then there's a negative of
[33:18] that and a negative of that because see
[33:20] you continue on so there is no limit to
[33:23] God but see there is a portion that
[33:25] that's going to be made known here y
[33:28] right exactly but but there is a a
[33:30] message of cheer down through the
[33:31] endless ages so there is an because you
[33:34] know if you reach a place where God you
[33:36] run out of God if you run out of the
[33:38] unfolding of God then he's not infinite
[33:41] exactly Glory that's right yep that's
[33:44] right then that that he that he's not
[33:47] God am exactly and and the other thing
[33:52] when you when you look at an
[33:54] object one one object and the and the
[33:58] and the other object they the force that
[34:01] they that's pulling against these two is
[34:03] based on their Mass right the mass of
[34:06] one is is directly the pull that it has
[34:10] is directly proportional to the mass
[34:11] that it has yeah yeah so that's the
[34:15] reason that when they go around black
[34:17] holes and stuff they talk about the mass
[34:18] is because the mass is shrunk down right
[34:22] and so it's become compacted so there's
[34:24] a larger Mass there and that mass has a
[34:28] pull but when you see when when when
[34:31] science when they look at
[34:33] this because there's no way to to
[34:36] measure this they just you know because
[34:38] there's no working model of an
[34:40] Infinity but something that has infinite
[34:43] mass or Infinite
[34:46] Energy the pull that it has on another
[34:48] object you know what you end up
[34:52] with
[34:54] infinity anything that has infinite Mass
[34:56] Infinite Energy the pull on that is
[34:59] infinite yeah right there is there's no
[35:01] there's no end to the pull it pulls it
[35:03] right in there's no way to overcome that
[35:06] so whatever whatever you start with
[35:08] that's infinite it doesn't matter what
[35:10] you do to it whatever it has the
[35:12] characteristics that it has whatever it
[35:13] does it's all infinite because there's
[35:15] no way to there's no other way for it to
[35:18] overcome anything so when you when you
[35:20] see that you
[35:23] understand if you understand that
[35:25] concept of of seeing that
[35:28] something that's Eternal that's
[35:33] right he said no man can come to me
[35:35] unless my father draws him that's
[35:38] right he said he said the very head of
[35:41] the hairs of your head are all numbered
[35:43] right he said I he said you're written
[35:45] in the palms of my hands he said he said
[35:47] I wouldn't lose a one of them that's
[35:50] right if you and so what what is that
[35:53] that's that is because it's an eternal
[35:55] pull right and so the Eternal pool that
[35:58] started here can you can't overcome that
[36:02] amen thank you
[36:03] Lord there's no way to overcome that
[36:06] exactly so he can't lose you right
[36:13] amen so I hope you I hope you like
[36:17] that that's what the Lord showed
[36:20] me so we can we can see who we are
[36:23] exactly
[36:28] and so when we come to
[36:46] this so I'm bad at this
[36:50] but but what he
[36:51] said he was self-existing
[36:55] he dealt along with his attributes
[36:58] Elohim self-existing when he when he was
[37:01] existing he said back before the Eternal
[37:04] right so when you come to that when you
[37:06] come to this and
[37:09] you you know God has to speak to you the
[37:11] way he can speak to you
[37:14] amen and you know I mean maybe maybe God
[37:17] maybe I'm the only one that God can use
[37:19] you know that he can speak through
[37:20] things that I understand right because
[37:22] I've been there and I've done it so to
[37:24] me I can when when I I can see things
[37:27] that are scien I can understand that I
[37:29] can understand things that are
[37:29] mathematical right and so you know I can
[37:32] see where he said he said in the
[37:34] beginning before the Eternal right oh
[37:38] my the self-existing one
[37:42] exactly he said he he said he dwelt
[37:44] along with his attributes there he was
[37:47] the essence of God that's what he
[37:49] started with here back before the
[37:51] Eternal back back when there was nothing
[37:53] when he was by itself because Eternal
[37:55] speaks of something that came in a in a
[37:58] progression right because that's what
[38:00] came when when he started to
[38:02] condescend he said in the condescending
[38:04] he said the Son of God came into view
[38:08] right Christ amen he said he said that's
[38:11] what came out of you and so if you see
[38:13] that what came out of Elohim was the
[38:16] Christ exactly this that's what came
[38:19] here was was the son of God that's what
[38:21] came into being
[38:23] right and so when when you see
[38:28] and people say all that God was he
[38:30] poured into Christ and then they try to
[38:32] do away with God yeah they try to do
[38:34] away with this part and see if you can
[38:37] understand that what what was here Y is
[38:40] infinite is eternal exactly what is here
[38:43] all that God was here he poured into
[38:45] Christ the only thing that he could pour
[38:47] into Christ was the essence of God but
[38:50] he could not pour away because he's
[38:52] infinite so if he was infinite then how
[38:54] can you divide you can't divide infinite
[38:57] because you'd still have infinite and
[38:59] infinite exactly so you can you can't
[39:03] you can't do away with God so when it
[39:05] what came into the bride what came into
[39:07] the bride he said the bride was the
[39:10] fullness of the godhe had bottle if this
[39:12] is what he was right was the fullness
[39:16] then that's what we are we are the
[39:19] fullness then that's what then that's
[39:21] what we see what took place here with
[39:24] what took place
[39:26] here yes sir so I can understand when he
[39:28] said everything that God was he poured
[39:30] into Christ everything that Christ was
[39:33] he poured into the
[39:37] believer because that because we have we
[39:40] are the very essence of God right
[39:43] exactly
[39:44] y because see that's why that's why we
[39:47] have a hard time wrapping our mind
[39:49] around Who We Are Who that we can see
[39:52] see when we see all God was he poured
[39:56] into him right and you can't exhaust him
[39:59] right exactly
[40:01] righten so if we can't exhaust see you
[40:03] can't exhaust this then what came into
[40:07] here that's what came here right the
[40:10] unchangeable god that's what that is who
[40:12] we are we have become the unchangeable
[40:15] god right if we see that that's what you
[40:18] know lots of times we don't see that
[40:20] right brother amen
[40:28] and
[40:30] so bless you y'all pray for me see some
[40:35] sometimes when you preach you you look
[40:36] at things I've had things in and well
[40:39] I'll be done in 30 minutes takes me an
[40:41] hour and a half yeah I've had things
[40:43] make look like it take you forever next
[40:45] say you know I'll be done in 45 minutes
[40:48] oh and so you never know how things are
[40:50] going to go but uh all right you know I
[40:54] just I just know I'm going to come up
[40:54] here I'm going to say what I got to say
[40:56] and I'm I'm
[40:58] right am cuz if I if I just say what I
[41:02] got to say then I won't get any
[41:04] trouble and I was going I was going to
[41:06] say this this afternoon when I started
[41:08] that if I mess up on anything if I say
[41:09] anything wrong we got two up here got
[41:11] two Fine Brothers in the front they take
[41:13] care of it and they can straighten me
[41:14] out and they can answer all your
[41:16] questions I just come in to say it and
[41:17] if it's wrong they fix
[41:20] it no but I mean if you don't but I mean
[41:23] if you don't understand if we can help
[41:24] you I mean sure we we would like to be
[41:26] able to
[41:27] express it in a in a way that maybe the
[41:29] Lord can help because
[41:34] right because you know and you know
[41:37] there's many different quotes that you
[41:39] you look
[41:41] at and uh
[41:44] even when when you speak of the essence
[41:46] of God just just give you a few
[41:48] quotes uh in the patmas vision the
[41:52] church age
[41:53] book I think that's page 50
[41:57] brother brand said the outpouring the
[41:59] original outpouring of Pentecost which
[42:01] outpouring came directly from Jesus on
[42:03] the mercy suit is in doing his church
[42:06] through all the Seven Ages showing forth
[42:08] perfectly that Jesus Christ is the same
[42:11] yesterday today yesterday and today and
[42:13] forever the neighbor changing God in his
[42:15] Essence and his ways so we understand
[42:18] and even brother talked about the woman
[42:20] at the well the elame woman when he came
[42:22] he said she met the very essence of
[42:24] eternal life right and even
[42:28] the
[42:29] uh in the Smur Church age he said uh
[42:34] speaking of
[42:36] uh let's see even in the Ephesian Church
[42:39] age he said uh Behold Him who is even
[42:45] now walking in the midst of the churches
[42:47] through all ages Behold Him who is the
[42:49] same yesterday and today and forever and
[42:52] who never changes in either in his
[42:55] essence or his ways he said the Eternal
[42:58] thoughts of God let me ask you are the
[42:59] thoughts of God Eternal if you can see
[43:02] this you can see many things God is
[43:04] unchangeable in both Essence and
[43:06] behavior right so that's just a few
[43:08] quotes that I had that that we
[43:11] understand God and the essence
[43:14] understanding the attributes yeah the
[43:16] the be the the attributes of God how
[43:19] they don't change right and how they
[43:21] were just carried over and so the other
[43:24] thing that the other thing that struck
[43:25] me
[43:29] when you're speaking of the attributes
[43:31] when you're thinking when you're talk
[43:32] about the essence of God where he what
[43:35] he in the beginning Elohim the
[43:38] self-existing one when he came into
[43:42] Christ see they say was Jesus a
[43:46] different
[43:50] identity well let me let me ask you this
[43:54] this this is this is a def this is
[43:56] definitions of
[43:57] of
[43:59] identity the state or fact of remaining
[44:01] the same one or ones as under varying
[44:04] aspects or conditions the state of
[44:07] having unique identifying
[44:08] characteristics held by no other person
[44:11] or thing exact likeness in nature or
[44:15] qualities the condition of being one
[44:17] self or itself and not another the
[44:20] distinct personality of an individual
[44:23] regarded as a persisting entity
[44:26] individual it so that's all that's
[44:29] definitions of an
[44:35] identity
[44:39] well we know the son of the Son of God
[44:42] came out in the beginning amen and he
[44:46] said that he said he doesn't change in
[44:48] his Essence exactly or his ways or his
[44:50] behavior right and he said this was a
[44:52] part of God that came out not like an
[44:54] arm or a leg but he said it was the but
[44:56] a part of God came out right and he said
[44:59] it was the Sun so we understand that was
[45:01] the essence of God exactly so the
[45:03] essence of God came out and so we
[45:05] understand if we if we understand that
[45:07] and we understand that the exact it's
[45:10] exact likeness in nature qualities the
[45:13] same act the state or act of remaining
[45:15] the same one or
[45:17] ones remaining the same one as under
[45:20] varing aspects or
[45:22] conditions right brother Brandon
[45:24] preached the message the unchangeable
[45:26] god acting in an unexpected way
[45:29] right so he was because he was
[45:32] unchangeable God but he
[45:34] came into a different form right and so
[45:37] the form but that didn't change who he
[45:39] was right so how can so if this is what
[45:42] and then he said he became the fullness
[45:46] of the godhead bodily y right yep in the
[45:49] beginning was the word the word was with
[45:51] God and the Word was God and the word
[45:53] became flesh right if he became flesh
[45:57] then how can you have a different
[45:59] identity right come on that's right
[46:02] because if he started with those things
[46:04] he doesn't change then how can then how
[46:06] can you have him as a different
[46:08] identity right see you you've already
[46:11] made him because you know it's like it's
[46:13] like comparing apples and oranges to
[46:15] fruit right
[46:17] yeah because you start with you start
[46:19] with a division that you can't ever
[46:22] overcome right it doesn't matter how
[46:24] much you preach one God if you start
[46:26] with that division exactly you'll never
[46:28] you never overcome that you always you
[46:31] always have that division right am and
[46:34] so he was not he was not a different
[46:38] identity he changed he just as brother
[46:41] told us he said he just changed his mask
[46:43] he came in he came into another form but
[46:46] that didn't change who he was because
[46:48] Christ Christ was revealed all the way
[46:50] down through the Angels because we saw
[46:53] we saw that all the way
[46:54] through all the in the prophet
[46:58] because brother speaking up the prophets
[47:00] building the body right if the if the
[47:02] prophets built the body on what they
[47:05] done because we
[47:07] understand and I got got a couple other
[47:10] things I I want to share with
[47:12] you can we turn to Romans chapter
[47:20] 16 Romans
[47:23] 1625 I don't know I like I like this
[47:26] script
[47:33] it says now to him that is of power to
[47:35] establish you according to my gospel and
[47:38] the preaching of Jesus Christ according
[47:40] to the revelation of the mystery which
[47:42] was Kept Secret since the world began
[47:44] but now is made manifest and by the
[47:47] scriptures of the prophets according to
[47:49] the Commandment of the Everlasting God
[47:51] made known to All Nations for The
[47:53] Obedience of Faith to God only wise be
[47:56] glory through Jesus Christ forever
[48:01] amen I tell you what the Apostle Paul
[48:03] can say a lot in a few
[48:07] words because you
[48:09] know here he is he's speaking he's
[48:11] speaking of a he said the revelation of
[48:14] the mystery right that was Kept
[48:18] Secret you know brother Ram there's two
[48:21] scriptures there's two scriptures that
[48:23] come to mind when I when I when I first
[48:25] read this the first one the first one is
[48:28] Amos 3:7 he said he said he would he
[48:31] would do nothing he said he would reveal
[48:34] his secret right to the prophets he
[48:37] didn't say that he would re rece reveal
[48:39] the mystery he said he would rece the M
[48:41] the secret unto the prophets and so that
[48:43] was what he said the mystery was Kept
[48:45] Secret yeah right and so see without
[48:49] unless you see something or something
[48:51] takes place you do not know there's a
[48:53] mystery
[48:54] exactly see that's just like the the
[48:57] first time the uh the
[49:00] Indians and think it was in Mexico or
[49:02] somewhere down that way uh some of the U
[49:06] um explorers were coming through and the
[49:09] Indians had never seen a black
[49:13] men and there was one in the in the
[49:16] group that was
[49:18] exploring and you know they were so
[49:20] amazed at that that they walked up to
[49:22] him and they tried to rub the black off
[49:24] of him and they were examining him
[49:26] because he was so amazed they never seen
[49:28] that before yeah but see that was a
[49:30] secret to them they never knew that
[49:34] right and so until they saw that then it
[49:37] became a mystery to them yeah because
[49:39] they were and so see God had to come
[49:43] down and he was revealing himself that
[49:46] was the secret people didn't understand
[49:49] that's right and so it became it was
[49:51] unfolding
[49:52] glory and so people didn't understand
[49:55] the prophets they didn't understand they
[49:58] didn't understand why Moses done the
[50:00] things he done why Jeremiah done the
[50:02] things he done
[50:04] Ezekiel why were they why they done the
[50:06] things that they done was because they
[50:09] were making him known and so as the
[50:12] scripture tells us see the revelation of
[50:14] the mystery which was Kept Secret since
[50:17] the world began see it was a secret y
[50:20] but see they didn't know what was going
[50:22] on but God kept trying to unveil himself
[50:25] even even in all of the things said
[50:27] through the Old Testament through the
[50:28] building of the Tabernacle and all of
[50:30] The Commandments and everything he was
[50:32] revealing himself right amen see as you
[50:34] know brother said he said they took it
[50:36] as a book of rules and regulations and
[50:39] missed him yeah yep amen and you know in
[50:43] Jeremiah there when he speaking of it he
[50:45] said they they've HED out sists broken
[50:48] sists he said they missed me the
[50:50] Fountain of Living Water Glory that's
[50:52] right he said theyve missed me
[50:57] and he said he said but they have broken
[50:59] sistems that hold no water right that's
[51:02] right and so we see see but in the end
[51:05] time what Revelation 10 tell us the
[51:09] mystery right would be made known
[51:11] brother said that all the Loose Ends
[51:13] would be tied up Sir see the mystery had
[51:16] to be made known see that's what came in
[51:18] the because see it was a secret but the
[51:21] secret was being unfolded yeah because
[51:25] brother brother said the mystery was
[51:26] kept secret
[51:28] Y and so it came as he was unfolding
[51:31] then there became a
[51:33] mystery because when he when when he
[51:35] walked in
[51:37] flesh he said you know because he said
[51:40] look back at what was written he said
[51:42] see if I don't do what what was said of
[51:44] me right amen right he said if if I'm
[51:47] not the one that that they spoke of Y he
[51:50] said search the scriptures and say and
[51:53] say if that's not who who I am I am what
[51:57] thought what was spoke of me right and
[51:59] that's what he done he come to
[52:01] fulfill right you know as brother said
[52:04] he walked in he walked in a a realm of
[52:06] perfect Faith yeah why did he walk in a
[52:08] realm of perfect Faith because he knew
[52:10] what he was supposed to do right sure he
[52:13] had to grow in Grace and knowledge sure
[52:16] sure when when he came into into into
[52:18] the flesh sure he was bound by that
[52:22] flesh see because brother BR said God is
[52:25] infinite but we're finite he came into a
[52:28] finite being
[52:31] right see he was he was limited by what
[52:34] he right and as as Brother D was talking
[52:37] about see you
[52:39] understand when he said God is so great
[52:41] he can forget yeah thank you
[52:47] right
[52:49] exactly he he's so big that he can that
[52:52] he can limit
[52:53] himself Y and not change
[53:02] why because that's an attribute right
[53:04] exactly see we can't we can't do that we
[53:07] can forgive but we can't always forget
[53:09] right right amen and the problem that we
[53:11] have is when we try to remember we
[53:13] forget
[53:14] right right exactly see there things
[53:17] there's things that I had to write notes
[53:19] on this afternoon because I thought well
[53:21] I'll remember that I don't remember I
[53:22] had to write if I didn't put notes down
[53:24] I would have forgot right because and
[53:26] you know I'm thinking I I kept going
[53:28] over this and things in my mind like
[53:29] well I should remember that well I don't
[53:32] right cuz sometimes you know I don't
[53:34] know if y'all know this or not if you
[53:35] ever been up in front of a group
[53:37] sometimes you forget things so people
[53:38] look at you and then
[53:40] yeah you
[53:43] know I'm glad thank you for all the ones
[53:45] that are smiling yeah
[53:49] um but you know we see
[53:57] Elohim coming into
[53:59] flesh and when he came into
[54:03] flesh see all that was spoken of him
[54:06] that's what he done right and he walked
[54:08] in the realm of perfect
[54:10] Faith because he said I I do nothing
[54:13] except for what my father showeth me
[54:15] right he said the son can do nothing of
[54:18] himself what except what he see the
[54:19] father do right he said that doth the
[54:22] son likewise right right you know that
[54:26] that that all that struck me the first
[54:27] time I really saw that to understand
[54:29] that you know he could walk out there
[54:31] and and he just
[54:34] walked and come and come to a place that
[54:36] he could have confidence with with God
[54:39] yeah because he came in he came into
[54:41] that place that he could
[54:43] walk and that's the reason when he came
[54:45] to the pool of bethesa you know he
[54:47] couldn't do anything but there was one
[54:48] that he could come to that's right and
[54:50] he could come to all the different ones
[54:52] that's right and there he was and all
[54:53] the people that were sick in his own
[54:55] country he said is not without honor
[54:57] except in his own country right see he
[55:00] he knew where he was at but you know he
[55:02] could he couldn't do
[55:04] anything but to the ones that he could
[55:07] when Lazarus was Lazarus was sick he
[55:10] knew what was going to take place so he
[55:11] didn't have to worry about it right he
[55:13] didn't worry he just went on about his
[55:14] business because until the time came
[55:16] that he could come to
[55:18] Lazarus then then he knew what he was
[55:20] going to do right Y and yet here here he
[55:23] was in flesh and yet the yet the yet the
[55:25] flesh
[55:27] that he dwelt
[55:30] in he could be
[55:32] sick he could hurt he could be lonely y
[55:36] exactly as the scripture says you know
[55:38] he was our high priest that it could be
[55:40] touched by the feeling of our
[55:41] infirmities that he understood those
[55:43] things that that that even even he
[55:45] didn't want to die but he gave but he
[55:47] yielded himself under under the wheel of
[55:50] the father not my will but thine be done
[55:53] so he had to even come to that place
[55:55] that he had to work through all those
[55:56] things and yet he he come through that
[55:59] right amen that's it and see we see that
[56:03] what took place here was you know what
[56:06] what took place here what we
[56:08] saw was God in flesh
[56:12] right come on now and so we see that
[56:15] what came out it was God condescending
[56:18] the whole time exactly and here he come
[56:20] all the way down that's
[56:23] right that's right that's right and
[56:28] we understand the spirit left him yeah
[56:31] in the
[56:33] garden but that didn't change who he was
[56:36] no right that's right because he had to
[56:38] be anointed to to the ministry right
[56:41] right see that that didn't change him
[56:44] from here to here even when he died
[56:47] that's right the life that left him
[56:49] that's right when the spirit left him
[56:51] the Holy Spirit left him amen because it
[56:54] had to be the that the only thing it
[56:55] could be right that's right brother so
[56:58] the life that went out from him because
[56:59] he said the life that came out of him
[57:01] came out of Jesus on the cross he said
[57:04] that same life came back onto the bride
[57:07] that's right Glory so we we received see
[57:11] so we received the life of Elohim we've
[57:14] received Eternal amen we've received
[57:17] we've received a portion of that
[57:18] infinite but that infinite is still
[57:21] infinite amen
[57:23] hallelujah and see we can understand see
[57:26] no matter how how vast God is we
[57:29] understand one
[57:32] thing brother Ram
[57:36] said see if I can find it then I'm
[57:43] going I don't see here it
[57:46] is and lean not to your own
[57:49] understanding brother R says so you see
[57:52] if you were in the forn knowledge of God
[57:54] right then you are becoming a part of
[57:58] God exactly and the only way you can be
[58:00] a son or a son of God or a daughter of
[58:03] God is you had to be a part of God glory
[58:06] and God isn't complete without you
[58:10] GL
[58:12] exactly because
[58:14] see God said he was brother said that
[58:17] God came to display all his
[58:20] attributes right is that right all the
[58:24] attributes of God came because The Plan
[58:26] of Redemption came the the plan that
[58:29] came into existence was to display all
[58:32] those attributes right right now God is
[58:37] infinite but I want you to see one thing
[58:40] the part of God that you received is
[58:43] just like this part right here yeah
[58:47] right you can go this way as far as you
[58:49] want to you can go that way as far as
[58:51] you want
[58:52] to but just to give you an illustration
[58:55] this is only there's only one one and a
[58:58] half in the whole number
[59:01] line right this right here Che that's
[59:04] infinite that's an infinite set of
[59:06] numbers that way that's an infinite set
[59:08] of numbers that way you can have but but
[59:11] if that part of God is not made manifest
[59:15] God's not complete amen that's right
[59:18] amen he can be infinite but there's a
[59:21] part of God that you and I Glory are to
[59:25] manifest
[59:26] right brother Bram said the ministry of
[59:29] Jesus Christ right was not complete he
[59:32] said he left something for the bride to
[59:35] do manifest Jesus Christ that's who we
[59:38] are right
[59:40] there we have
[59:43] come from the mind of God right the very
[59:47] essence of God that's it is now in flesh
[59:51] am
[59:54] hallelujah amen that's right and we'
[59:57] we've had somebody coming in the last
[1:00:02] days and it's not just brother brandom
[1:00:10] coming because Brother D was talking
[1:00:12] about that angel that came and spoke to
[1:00:15] John he said he he didn't he didn't
[1:00:17] trust it to nobody no angel no man
[1:00:21] nobody right it come he came himself
[1:00:25] right
[1:00:27] y that's what he came and revealed that
[1:00:31] made that manifest what came in what
[1:00:33] came in our
[1:00:36] day
[1:00:38] exactly
[1:00:40] amen see we we've had we've
[1:00:43] had the voice of God glory we've heard
[1:00:47] the voice of God exactly
[1:00:49] amen and so that's what's speaking to us
[1:00:52] it's not the it's not the voice of
[1:00:54] William Brown right
[1:00:57] but it's the voice that speaks through
[1:00:58] the man Glory that spoke through the man
[1:01:01] as he said you know he said he
[1:01:04] said you know he said I am a son of man
[1:01:07] revealing the son of man right that's
[1:01:10] right so he was there and there was a
[1:01:13] part you know he just came to be the
[1:01:16] mouthpiece to
[1:01:19] speak to speak the word to you and I
[1:01:23] that we become this
[1:01:27] that we become who he
[1:01:29] is exactly we are we are because then
[1:01:32] then you understand what a manifested
[1:01:34] son is
[1:01:36] right so one that one that's
[1:01:44] come because if you see he didn't lose
[1:01:47] any of his
[1:01:49] attributes he didn't he didn't lose
[1:01:51] anything he didn't change the essence of
[1:01:52] God did not change here to here what
[1:01:55] changes when it comes to here see it's
[1:01:57] the same one that comes here right so
[1:02:00] it's not as brother Dell told
[1:02:02] us it's not the father going off the
[1:02:05] scene it's the father coming on the
[1:02:07] scene why because it's the father being
[1:02:09] made manifest amen because it's the
[1:02:12] essence of God being made known
[1:02:15] right because see that's the reason that
[1:02:18] brother Bram said when the bride says I
[1:02:21] and my father are
[1:02:23] one he said then watch the shut away see
[1:02:26] that's the because when you see who you
[1:02:28] are you can
[1:02:30] see see people have missed that they're
[1:02:33] missing that they're missing the part of
[1:02:35] seeing who they are right that's right
[1:02:38] because you can see we we are we are him
[1:02:42] amen he said the same word that speaks
[1:02:45] of the Bride also speaks of the groom
[1:02:47] the same that speaks of the groom speaks
[1:02:48] of the Bride Glory mhmh because he said
[1:02:52] that he became us he became sin who knew
[1:02:55] no sin that we might become the very
[1:02:57] righteousness of God so if we have
[1:03:00] become see then it's God made manifest
[1:03:02] again in flesh amen see when when you
[1:03:06] see who you are he said then the Rapture
[1:03:08] will take place well you've got to see
[1:03:10] who you are you've got to see that you
[1:03:12] are living breathing instrumentalities
[1:03:15] of Jesus Christ you got to see that you
[1:03:17] are the fullness that's right because he
[1:03:19] said what he pour into what what from
[1:03:22] God was poured into Christ was poured
[1:03:23] into the believer people we get in our
[1:03:26] mind we're talking about the bride but
[1:03:28] you know we we're going to become the
[1:03:29] fullness right right exactly because
[1:03:33] that's what's taking place right right
[1:03:37] right that's what that is what's
[1:03:39] happening
[1:03:41] but negative to positive right you
[1:03:45] continue on
[1:03:47] exactly it's being poured in being
[1:03:50] molded and made into the image of Jesus
[1:03:53] Christ right that's it amen right amen
[1:03:56] God bless you i' it
[1:03:59] bless I hope you enjoyed that amen amen
[1:04:04] amen we'll all stand the musicians will
[1:04:07] come
[1:04:11] I glory amen
[1:04:18] amen we believe in
[1:04:24] miracles amen
[1:04:27] amen
[1:04:40] hallelujah what you saying
[1:04:47] 201 201 and R He Got the Whole World in
[1:04:51] His Hand amen
[1:05:10] amen
[1:05:12] amen can we sing this even if you have a

[1:16:16] right amen so we go this
[1:16:19] evening anybody have any anything to say
[1:16:23] any all mind Hearts clear before we go
[1:16:26] let's give her
[1:16:34] brother I sharing with a guy about the
[1:16:36] infinity one time up on a travel cage
[1:16:39] painy he said Infinity had a beginning
[1:16:41] and end like that you know let me tell
[1:16:45] you something about Infinity that really
[1:16:47] impressed me it used to be a TV show a
[1:16:49] long time ago um Ben Casey was the name
[1:16:53] of it and when man come out there he
[1:16:55] drew a picture of a circle and cross
[1:16:58] under it said this is a man or woman I
[1:17:00] don't know which one it was then he draw
[1:17:02] a thing you know and he said then this
[1:17:05] one's a man like that you know and then
[1:17:06] he went up there and he draw that like
[1:17:08] that you know and he said that's
[1:17:10] Infinity it didn't make any difference
[1:17:13] you know it didn't make nothing to me at
[1:17:14] that time what maybe when I come to
[1:17:17] understand the message of the hour and
[1:17:18] where you're coming to and you can take
[1:17:21] that infinity and stand it up this way
[1:17:25] and becomes an
[1:17:31] eight when they used to when they first
[1:17:33] started printing because the printing
[1:17:35] presses back then right when when liance
[1:17:38] and all of them
[1:17:40] that started developing calculus and
[1:17:42] Newton and all of them when print and
[1:17:44] presses didn't have Infinity so that's
[1:17:46] what they done they turned the eight
[1:17:48] sideways in the print press that's
[1:17:50] that's the infinity
[1:17:51] symbol but see that thing if you if you
[1:17:53] make it r like the design they had for
[1:17:57] it not just two little
[1:17:58] circles like this and you look at it
[1:18:02] it's a circle mhm laying on its side
[1:18:05] instead of a straight line if you look
[1:18:08] at it it's a circle mm
[1:18:12] amen mean something to me I appreciate
[1:18:16] that I believe you preach not what I
[1:18:18] believe the only thing I got to do the
[1:18:22] only thing I have to do is Manifest
[1:18:24] that's right
[1:18:27] what's on one side is on the other and I
[1:18:29] can't I I don't believe that you can
[1:18:31] come to the place you talking about
[1:18:32] tonight with a trinitarian
[1:18:35] doctr because you got
[1:18:37] something that you didn't begin with
[1:18:40] that's right that's right
[1:18:43] hallelujah thank you Jesus when you see
[1:18:46] that you can see where brother R said I
[1:18:48] always was eternal
[1:18:49] right exactly I always was eternal but
[1:18:54] right I was on my way to hell
[1:19:01] right and because when it when it comes
[1:19:04] down I
[1:19:07] mean when God shows it to you people
[1:19:10] people think it's so hard but it's it's
[1:19:12] so simple God God has revealed
[1:19:14] Simplicity right that's right exactly
[1:19:17] exactly right and when you when you see
[1:19:18] when you're looking at the infinity
[1:19:21] symbol you know it's
[1:19:23] all what what one part of it is the
[1:19:26] mirror of the other you're see you're
[1:19:28] seeing you're seeing what's on one side
[1:19:30] is on the other just like you talked
[1:19:32] about the Old Testament and the New
[1:19:33] Testament they match up
[1:19:35] perfect what speaks of the Bride speaks
[1:19:37] of the groom they match perfectly right
[1:19:43] amen I tell you something's bothering me
[1:19:45] y'all pray for
[1:19:47] me I don't want to get to where I won't
[1:19:50] share with
[1:19:51] people because I know that there's
[1:19:53] people that ain't going receive it
[1:19:55] anyhow that's right but don't never get
[1:19:58] let me get to the
[1:20:00] point but but make me
[1:20:04] understand that everybody is not going
[1:20:06] to receive it right you know
[1:20:11] it's you know I I've shared with people
[1:20:14] for years and years and years and
[1:20:16] years and they
[1:20:18] just I'm Christian people so so to speak
[1:20:23] mhm and it BS

[1:20:29] he shared one guy with me right start
[1:20:31] with i something for the truth on water
[1:20:35] baptism and I knew what he said with
[1:20:38] what I was looking for took me a while

[1:20:53] man he said cancer and he's had bunch of
[1:20:56] stuff going
[1:20:57] on and uh he's decided he wants to get
[1:21:01] in church and what have like that this
[1:21:03] is the what's going around people are
[1:21:05] telling it around right right now and he
[1:21:08] he told me when I shared with him one
[1:21:10] time he said I a see where I need to be
[1:21:12] Reb
[1:21:14] baptized but see I can't drag him down
[1:21:17] there right he's got to want to go what
