together and that's one thing we all like to do we like to eat so just you know come and be with us announce it to to everyone and you know tell everybody to come and fellowship with us for the weekend the Easter weekend all right man any other announcements now if you would turn to Ezekiel 36 and we'll read from there we read this morning used a couple of times on John 3 but we'll go to Ezekiel 36 and then we'll just read and try to continue the message on from this morning of what we were talking abouten let's pray father we thank you thank you for you Lord most of all thank you for all things thank you for these children Lord that want to sing and and to do Lord and to show us how much they think about you are singing the songs of sign and and have a little part in the church because Lord time goes on these will be the leaders of the church way on down the road some of them but still they'll be prepared because they are being prepared now we love you and we thank you we ask you now that you would just come as we read your word and you would speak to our hearts and our lives and that we may hear from you this day and Grant understanding we pray you'd bless each thought and idea that it may be according to your will we love you in Jesus name amen I said we get Ezekiel 36 so I decided we' just go ahead and try to cover it today but what I want to do now I want you to drop back up with me to to verse 22 read the whole thing it's talking about Israel right but this is not this is is Scofield even got any the future Israel of restoration and conversion all right and that's what it will be right because see natural I mean you know the 144,000 of Israel one day will go through this situation also because they're going to receive uh the baptism of the Holy Ghost once we get out of here right but we are the spiritual Israel so we'll see the parts you know and that way we can understand what'll happen to them at the end of of the doing so all right verse 22 therefore say unto the house of Israel thus sayith the Lord God I do not this for your sakes oh House of Israel but for mine Holy Name sake now I like that right he's going to keep his word which you have profaned among the Heathen whether you went and I will sanctify my great name which was profound profaned among the Heathen which ye have profaned in the midst of them and the Heathen shall know that I am the Lord sayith the Lord God when I shall be when I shall be Sanctified in you before their eyes right for I will take you from among the Heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land then I will sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit and and I will put and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you an heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them and you shall shall dwell in the land that I give to your fathers and you shall be my people and I will be your God you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word as I said this is this is a prophecy all right a prophecy of what will happen to the children of Israel 144,000 in the uh end time after the the bride but it's speaking of you and I and telling us what will take place you know in each one of us uh that receives the new birth because that's really what it's dealing with and I want to cover that now with what we were doing and I I want to uh just back up just a little bit and not say much but you know I want you to follow me in the message and then you you at least see what I believe the new birth is cuz I believe the new birth is the birth of the word but I believe you must hear that word you know because it was never in the Bible that the Holy Ghost fell on anyone that had not heard the word first you know and and in doing that then we we know that Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word so we we must hear first and then the Holy Ghost can come and Quicken that word and we were talking about the soul and how the soul of the individual is the real you and uh you know being that I gave you something because uh I made a statement this morning and I I knew the point was Dire and but I made the statement and I still make the statement that I don't believe Satan is a soul now you may differ and I'll even read what brother Ram says here that sounds like it's contrary to what I'm saying and you take what he says but uh you know that way give the other on out but uh see I don't believe he's a soul because he would be created in the image of God that's right I believe Satan is the anointed chur right right that Stood Beside the Lord all right but he's not a soul see he is a spirit being created a spirit being he wasn't created to be a human being that's right and not but doing that then it would not require him to even have a soul and then to me see the soul is more real than what Satan is right right that's the point I'm W you to see now as the part that he perverted the nature of our soul he became our ruler right I mean Satan became actually our our U kin folks but then that's where the new birth comes in the new birth comes in to take us away from Satan being kin folks and us being kin folks to God by the birth of the soul but now I I I knew this quote was here but I tried to find it this morning in I couldn't find it in Brother Richard Wilson called me during the service and he said he he he said I want to know what you think says does Satan have a soul and I said no sir I just got through making that statement to the people this morning I do not believe Satan has a soul I'm just as honest as I can be about it and and you know because it would make him to be a person cuz a person is a soul right and Satan's not a person he's a spirit he's a created uh spiritual being let's see uh brother Rand says on page 9 99 of the Ephesians which is church edge book he says he's talking about Satan can't be a creator and all he couldn't be that cuz said for he is only a created spirit being he's not a he's not a a person like we are he's a spirit right he's the the head Spirit yeah and he was created and was standing beside the Lord but there's where the catch of it is see that brother Bram made the statement he said no man is a match for the devil all right but I believe ever born again believer if you you were just bornn again right now amen that you're more that you're capable of handling the the devil if you follow What God Says see no man is a match what brother R said the holy spirit is so if you get the new bird I believe it you know I'm glad that's come up to where I can make that statement as strong as I can make it cuz I believe every Born Again believer Satan's not a match for you anymore that's right no man by no person in our natural concept or thoughts you know of intelligence or Daniel was a wisest of all men it would be called and but he wouldn't a match for the devil right but one person that is born again that soul and that individual by the new birth having eternal life that makes you more than a match for the devil CU he cannot comprehend what's going on now I believe that now but I'll read you what brother R said then you can just make up your mind of what you you think about what I'm saying and and you know I'm not the final Authority anyway I'll just tell you what I believe but I will tell you what I believe right I well I don't know about that sound like his quotes this way and they sound like his quotes that way sound like the other no I just tell you what I believe then you can go from that point but let's look at it that day on Calvary 196 925 he said there was a requirement for sin requirement was death death death with his penalty and that is we could go into great details of this because I do not believe that there is but one death there is one life all right and I believe a man that has eternal life can never die right I believe that there is a complete annihilation of that soul that sins for the Bible said so the soul that sinth it shall die not the man the soul in it so Satan must surely die to be completely destroyed how I disagree with the universalists that say that Satan will be saved now see they say he can be saved cuz they say he's got a soul now that's the point I want to make watch it see for him to be able to be saved you're going to have to be saved and he's got a soul that's right now I don't believe the devil can be saved right he didn't have to fall now that was his choice but once he done that there's no salvation for him I'm sorry for the old boy you know that's what I'm saying any Born Again believer then is a match for the devil if you'll let the Holy Spirit lead you now you seen the way I said that you said well the devil will jump on this way the other hey he jumps all the time you know but if we'll just let God be the one from the soul that'll take care of it because we greater is he that is in you than the devil let me put it that way and paraphrase the scripture but look what he said I disagree with the Universalist that say Satan will be saved he sinned and he's the originator of sin his soul sinned and he was a spirit that Spirit shall to be totally annihilated to be nothing left of it now you can take that and you can read it and say well now Satan's got a soul but now this is the way I read it how did I disagree with the Universalist that say Satan can be saved yeah he sinned and he's the originator of sin see and they say the Universalist say his soul sinned you you can read it the way you want to that's the way I read cuz I knew the quote was there I told Brother Richard I said I know the quot quote I I knew it was there but I don't believe Satan has a soul not a soul of what I'm talking about you can call him a nature yeah cuz he does that he's got a nature about him right cuz he's trying his best to inflict us with that nature that's right amen right we see then he he'd have to be a he'd be created in the image of God angels were not created in the image of God man was the first one created in the image of God Satan had already fallen before Man was created in that image so you know I mean that's the way I read it so it's up to you because he didn't he said and his soul sinned and he was a spirit what's he saying they believe his soul sinned they believe he can be saved I don't believe Satan can be saved that's right cuz once he sinned I don't believe there salvation for Angels right no I mean I don't believe that you can if you want to that's up to you but I don't believe Angels you know can be saved that's right Angelic beings are Angelic beings that's right created for a wonderful purpose for helping the IRS of salvation but not made a soul so that's that's up to you now I gave you the one down under the next one to show you that even his offspring through uh uh the Beast brother BR said on the on questions and anwers of 64 there paragraph 1 11:31 he said that talking about the Beast he said he's smarter he almost had a soul the Beast almost had a soul he had a place for a soul but what did he do he sold out to Satan's deceiving to dece Satan to deceive God trying to see the Beast didn't have a soul man was the first one created right see in the true image of God right amen and that Soul was created as I've tried to bring down to you and bring in the theophany so where would you put Satan that's just me now you can you can argue the point and I'm I said I'm not the final Authority I'm just the one telling you what I believe and then I don't mind telling you uh you know cuz we know Satan's a spirit right amen he's a spiritual being right in that way then he wouldn't be a human being and that's a you can you can take that for whatever you want to and out there on the internet you'll know that I'm just as blunt as I can be and I'm not different with brother Brandon you know right and what would it matter if Satan did have a soul but I don't believe he did that's just as honest as I can believe it so it's you know we leave it on that cuz I believe what he done he set out to pervert the nature of your soul now I show you a lot where he can't create you know or nothing like that there's no way he can't well then you could go through the point like Brother Richard was bringing out see you and I are little creators by Soul right even then you fall in a state you're a little Creator right see Satan can't be that he can't be a Creator if he had any sense at all he'd take a long vacation and leave us alone but he's the best help we ever had cuz he's forcing us pushing us driving us to bring us to the word cuz that's what them demons are doing right amen all right but now let's get back to what we're talking about so you can have that for whatever you want I'm just and you show me and come and tell me and show me in the message you know where that Satan got a soul and I'll come right back here and tell the church okay right brother so and so showed me this and you know here it is but at least you'll know where I stand that way you can dig for whatever you want to to see if you can find it but I'm not going to worry about it but now listen see Satan perverted the nature of your soul amen coming through your brain as I said this morning down into you cuz he used your head all right and it went with mankind like that for 4,000 years y that mankind was under that domain of Satan the being inflicted and every baby that ever came in they had no opportunity to be anything else and even after the Lord Jesus coming in the 2,000 years every baby is still born the same way coming into the world into Satan's domain and Satan perverts the nature of that soul of that individual to the point that it makes us lost right exactly right okay now but in this dispensation in this time we have an opportunity that mankind didn't have say in the Old Testament in the the times before because we have a chance that's what Jesus was saying to Nicodemus Nicodemus you need to have that soul of yours you need to have the unclean Spirit driven out and maybe that was why that Nicodemus come to ask him the question because he'd heard Jesus say the unclean Spirit goeth out of a man walketh in dry places seek rest you know they kept up with it you better blank on one thing it's just like I was listening the other day and and you say well now I never heard of this message until a certain time brother renam said there's not a denomination that don't know about this message now that was a point to me he said there's not a denomination like I told you the old Baptist preacher that that when I left you know he said s I've heard about this William brandom and I won't say one thing about him he said but now I'd like you talk to other people I said I'd be glad to if you send them to me well he hadn't sent them yet that's 40 something years ago but any he told me I'd be away about 6 months well that's been a long 6 months you know he he was a good old man I really really appreciate him a good preacher he could preach he he he he he wasn't in the the making this that he preached about taking the saddle off the horse When you pray you know put it under the barn cuz it's going to get wet you know cuz he believed in prayer right you know and and I appreciate him but now just saying the point that the every person is born in that perverted real I don't care how good your mom and daddy is you said well Mom and Daddy was sweet and wonderful so I'm saved and all that don't make you Sav right you better be careful that'll make you a two-fold child of hell cuz you'll depending on that instead of depending on what God says see don't depend on what so and so done and I like what the way brother around said it he said we can't blame Adam and Eve right I like the way he preaches he said we don't we can't blame Adam and Eve now he said c we're all on free moral agency we everyone has got to make our choice by predestination you know sure God knows the choice but still you going to make the choice but see we got down to talking about how that the the new birth is the birth of that Soul it's eternal life coming and living in you exactly right that is the new birth but it requires for one thing to take place see that's why you anointed ones have you ever thought about why would the Holy Ghost come down on a person Spirit the genuine wi Holy Spirit now the prophet said he said now not something it's the Holy Spirit would come down on a person Spirit Y and just be anointed yep that's right well why would it be that way and maybe they're great religious people maybe they're they're sincere maybe they're sweet humble people but then hear some boot lag Jack lag of a garbage out there some word you know the best to say about all of us mankind and the Holy Spirit can come down and fall into a man's soul and make a child of God Amen that's right you never thought about those things that's right you don't think about you know what is the the difference you see I always love that scripture where it says got there's like four different in each gospel it's listing of what theyve done with the word but one of them says they took the word and held it right I like that right they counted it worthy and by counting it worthy it held on when others even seeing Jesus after his resurrection we're not in the upper room why now I've got them in here or somewhere and I forgot because I took out a bunch while ago notes but brother R said true prophets bring a true birth he said false prophets bring false birth the preaching of the word of God will bring a new birth but people preach the word of God it's being preached around the world today over and over but what is it being done right we inject just one little thing of our own thoughts and the word is no longer pure that's right how can it bring a pure birth that's right right you see what the trouble is the trouble is in the planting of the word right you know I just got to plant and a few seeds into the ground well you know I would know where I planted the corn you I expect it to come up I may get other things volunteered from last year but I don't expect a whole lot to grow in those Rose except what I planted you know because that's that's that's what we're doing and see that's what Jesus was doing he had to plant that seed that's right amen it wouldn't if he just come into the world and said I'm God I'll die for you the way he goes for 3 years he preached the gospel got three and a half there that's right preaching the gospel y to let that word get anchored Into the Heart y just kept anchoring it in and you know what what what was the difference in Judas and any of the rest of them when the Bible said he had a part of the ministry Etc right but what was wrong he had one little problem the little thing that he Lov money Y what else you going to say it well he was this that and the other I know what the Bible says that he was a thief from the beginning so he love money but why wouldn't he say right well he went on done it well I believe if he' waited and went on to Cal went on the upper room I believe Satan I mean that he could have been saved as quick as anybody else right but he didn't do it see something got in there right that's the point I'm trying to make to you you see why it's so important to preach the truth yes because if that word is not planted correctly how can the Holy Spirit Quicken it that's right that's right you said brother Dale you're talking to people here that probably 90% claims to be have the new birth that's all right but we'll get down to it maybe in this this evening with what we're talking about maybe you just got a new spirit right cuz you know what with a new spirit you get new desires right right so we better check ourselves out to find out if we are born again that's right and then not do well I believe the message see there's one of them little things that was planted Into the Heart of mankind and that's kept the holy ghost from going into that individual and Quicken the rest of it right they heard the message you know but somebody said well long as you believe the message now that seed went into the heart of an individual and you know that God can't Quicken that that's right amen you think about it yep that's right he can only he can only Quicken the pure word amen he can't Quicken our thoughts and our ideas Eve said I believe right and that's all it took so you think about it what's the difference in you and someone else well I go to church and I believe the prophet's message it's becoming now that this is beginning to be and and I predicted it back probably 5 years ago or something I said if this thing goes on 10 more years they they'll make us a denomination you know on the basis of writing us up for something and they'll because they'll say there's so many of them there's Millions now fallowing this message he said well they're not in the message well that's up to God certainly not me and you decide who's the message and who's not up to God right right would you want to put them to the point that you would want him to be in the message no no but listen then that new birth being a birth of the word so you've got to hear the word faith cometh by hearing that's right you've got to hear the word first and I say it and I keep saying it there's never been a person in the Bible that ever got the holy ghost that didn't hear a message first that's right am show it to me they heard something or knew about something mhm but how many of them also knew about it and didn't get it and S and listen why right well they would predestinated like I am there's one thing about it I hope you've caught what I believe about predestination cuz if you're predestinated you're going to live it you're going to find it you're going to get to it you're not going to worry about it you're not going to listen to to other things you're going to get settled into the word if you're predestinated right cuz only the word is predestinated eternally right but see we'll get back to that but what is it now it takes a revelation for you to be born again that was what Nicodemus couldn't comprehend and neither did the disciples have any understanding in that realm they still right even in the book of Acts after the resurrection of the Lord Jesus after all thing acts 18 I believe it is they still was talking about a natural Kingdom right will you restore this Israel land back to us in other words he said you don't understand it was just left to where they couldn't understand right cuz it takes the new birth to understand it takes the new birth to give you a revelation I'm talking about a holy ghost Eternal Revelation you get a revelation about a situation God can give it to you they gave as I said this morning he gave the little woman a revelation that she's healed cuz that's what the prophet calls Fai for the time in other words a revelation for the time of whatever you have need of right all right but that's not a holy ghost Born Again experience right see that's where everybody wants to put it and they say look at that little woman to the well the word come alive the prophet said but you know where she went she had to go to the upper room to get the new birth Mary gave birth to Jesus Christ but brother R said you can believe what you want to about your mother of God but said she went to the upper room to get to baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right amen that's right now so then you know it's not just I believe right right that's just a good place to start all right but now listen you're Prophet let me hurry up cuz I want to get to this other part your Prophet on the future home explains the new birth amen and he said that's where people say oh today it's different now I gave you the quote the very first line to what you're looking at on the the future home message it says what I've always taught those three stages of Grace that's coming from this morning which is number five on your know all right future home I've always taught three processes this that's right CU people people today say oh the new birth today oh yeah back down you it was this or it was that but today it's just a just a baptism of the Holy Ghost no in this age from isusa Street upward you must it's required that you be justified now do you hear what I said now I didn't mistaken do from isusa Street upward it's required the three process es right justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost right all right so if that's not taught to people that's right how do you know what to do and what breaks my heart is to think that I I didn't come through Pentecost but the most mixed up people about about the real New Birth I'm talking about old people at all it's a Pentecostal people right you think about a lot of the churches you've been around and a lot of preachers you've been around and their Pentecostal experience and you tell me a one that hardly knew anything or even knows anything about this message I'm sorry right I don't like to be that but I like to tell it that's the truth but see I believe you must be justified I believe that's an actual work in you that's right amen it's not walk up to the altar I want the Holy Ghost to turn around walk off and say I'm born again now that can happen that's right that can happen if you know what's going on it did to the 3,000 in the book of Acts right okay amen but it didn't to the 120 right right that's why the 120 was used to write the word out of them you don't use a novice to write the scriptures his personal experience with God before he used to write scriptures amen but on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell on the 3000 they heard one sermon and God went through that with them hearing that one sermon step by step as those as Peter was preaching that sermon until when it ended he had laid down such a wonderful thing about what the Lord Jesus Christ read the book of Acts there about it what took place and Jesus died and how all the things would happen and and all and then they said men and brother what must we do to be saved or what can we do to be saved they repent everyone and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ see they were brought totally under conviction by the Holy Spirit working a work in their soul because you're not born again in your body you're not born again in your spirit you're only Born Again In Your Soul justification drops off the five sins of that Soul sanctification cleans and sets in order the individual puts it to a place to where it to be clean the unclean Spirit going out of you right then the baptism of the Holy Ghost comes so you got to hear the word even the 3,000 they heard a sermon amen that's right not they just walked out there and said what can we do we'd like to have what y'all got when they first started hearing it they didn't like what they heard probably but Peter read that book of Acts Peter was laying it down so beautiful that's right it takes almost a whole chapter for him to explain right then they want to be saved it wouldn't just a halfhazard walk out there and the Holy Ghost fail I told you anointed ones that's Holy Spirit falls on their Spirit but the reason they're not born again they take some man's ideas and they're looking for some form of something I need to shout I need to speak in tongu I need to cry I need to do it's all laying in your nature somewhere right and if it's not killed by the word it'll grow up and become a big Amor right like I said it over and over people say what must I do to be saved quit doing this quit doing that don't do this do that go to church do believe a message that's not what the man said he ask him what can I do to be saved but follow what I'm talking about brother random draws three heart I mean two hearts there I believe myself that that's the one heart he's explaining cuz one of them's got a snake in it the other got a dove in it right if it is two people that's fine it's explaining it right but how did that get that dove in there now he explain they look just alike as you see them and they're both religious and they're both standing there looking alike yeah but one of them got a snake in his heart now don't tell me that an anointed one don't have a snake in the heart I'll tell you in a hurry they'll cut you pieces that's right and so will the people of this message that's right that's right you don't believe what we preach you're out that's right and if you don't come to our church you're out amen like I said this morning brother randam then say don't think you can come to the brandham Tabernacle just as bad as anywhere else that's right now he's the one make that statement like I said dark said brother Neville sitting there saying amen and brother around I'm saying it right it don't have you go to church it have you get born again amen right right but see I'm trying to get where I'm not going to read this but you read what I gave you there in a future home everybody on the internet can got it they can they can read it brother talks about justification or repentance being the first step amen that's right but he says that does nothing to your nature it's just repenting of your sins you just chopping off occupy sins it does nothing to your nature it don't give you eternal life right you just repent he just chopped it off he said what caused you to do it is still there right then he goes down a little further in it and he gets into sanctification he's talking about the unclean Spirit going out now I can give you one I wish you'd listen but brother brandom I love the way he speeches but speaks sometimes but sometimes it's hard to understand he said on one statement I was looking at this the other night he said that unclean Spirit went out of its own accord walketh in dry places and seeketh rest and findeth none now what's he talking about that unclean Spirit got where he couldn't stand that word it was being brought in all right so he's exactly right the unclean Spirit goes out of its own accord why it ain't you saying I'm going to drive you out I'm going to drive you out that's what I see the Pentecostals this message I watch them pray for people you know shout and scream and shake them and just I watched it in P one this church in Jamaica and seen them take the you know do like this and say say it say it say it say it say it say it to the little kids you know little 10 year old kids and say say s trying to get to speak in tongues that person didn't I didn't want that I just waited and let everybody else pray and then I'd go pray cuz that's way I've always been I told you we was in a prayer line one night and they were just praying down through there and they was all in that prayer line and they were just getting them to shout and getting them to cry and I'm not against that you think I am I'm not I'm wonderbly for it cuz there's emotions where a birth is right but then I was down on the end and I just stop him and I'd say Hey listen let's think a little bit what you want what do you need I need healing I need salvation I'd stop and pray with him for a little bit and you know what the same ones that shouted down to me stopped shouting when they got through with that then they started shouting the old brother I don't call his name but he was just preaching that night he kept he's eyeballing me and after a while he was down there listening and you know the next night what he was saying we had prayer line he said okay now let's get her B on the Lord I said Thank You Lord it caught on you see I wouldn't making no scene I was just doing my part and going on forgetting it cuz that's that's what I believe I believe in shouting ain't nobody in the world believes in shouting any more than I do or crying or whatever if it's any if it's a birth it's going to be an emotional thing babies are not born without a little crying or something you may have to spank them to get it to them but it'll work but listen see what is it justification just chops off your P sins but sanctification that hearing of the word even if it was in the book of Acts of them hearing that message and they believed it right there it drove that unclean Spirit out as we' call it right like I said if you hear enough of the word of God now here's a quote from Brother R he said can you live close enough to God so the devil don't know what to do with you he said yes right you know why cuz he don't like it like a man told me at work one time I was bragging on he said I don't understand you he said I see you out here working and he said you work here with these women and he said you don't have no problems do you I said no sir don't I said I'm a human mortal listen but but I said That's supposed to be taken care of he said that's what I've watched something to this situation he said but I guess it would be hard for them to try to flirt with you if you said hey have you heard about the Lord Jesus Christ amen and it works you tell me it don't work I'll give you a quote Lady Come Dancing up to brother brandham and a thing that was having it to work one night and what did he do he said I never die till I pray oh yeah you need that quote grabbed the lady by the hands got down and pray and busted the party he went to apologize to the boss cuz he busted up the party then you get them gooo eyes flirting around just start talking about the Lord that's right of course I've seen people do that flirt right on the end of the bedroom too talking about the Lord you have to but just be honest you start talking about the Lord it'll drive away them Spirits that's what I believe sanctification is right cuz I've experienced it you said Oh no just pray for me and cast that demon off that's why I love that quote where brother R said it he said he went out of his own accord I really should have brought that why he he it got crowded in there he just couldn't stand the word right you just keep packing that word in that Soul something going to happen right he said well you're just trying to make Christians by reading no no I'm trying to make people by reading you read G's Almanac and all these other filthy stuff won't you try reading the Bible get in the car turn turn to switch on your car and what I hear the the all kind of well you get in mind you turn it on why' it go you hear that old familiar voice the token of this day is the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen amen well I love to sit down in the woods in about 4 hours sitting there you know I'm just listening one t right after another just sleeping and just you know he got come home she said what you been doing I said been sleeping I mean hun I hone but get the point you can read what the prophets had to say but he said second early sanctification which sets our mind in order for Holiness that's right now listen I wish you get this one cuz I I didn't have the time I wanted to preach this and I will probably repr preach it but see when that when that Holy Spirit comes in at sanctification in a work of the Holy Spirit of sanctification and driving that unclean Spirit out you know that what brother R says it does he said it cleanses and claims that territory amen that's the reason it goes out see Satan can't stand it God comes in and lays a claim on your soul cleanses it and claims it now if it cleanse and claim your soul let me go one more step what do you think about this old boy out here why why do we want to get us a new body that's right when this one this cleansed and cleaned by the Holy Spirit living in us not just sanctification but by the Holy Spirit choosing to dwell in all right you see cleanse and claim it set it aside he said you've heard him explain it he said like a water glass you go out in the yard and you see a GL and you pick it up he said that's justification you got a reason for using it he said but it's still dirty is all get out right he said you don't take it in the house and use it he said no said take it in the house and wash it and SC it you know SC it out you know hot water boil it out he said then it's just now ready for service said it doesn't mean it's full he said you just got it ready to be used but see that's what happens he's explaining that sanctification it just brings you to a place that you're ready to go to work for God right but that's where the danger part is cuz if you don't go on and get to baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right amen you become very religious and that's what anointed ones do super religious people that maybe that unclean Spirit has been driven out but Satan comes back and finds a house swept and garnished and you know what the prophet said he'll do to you he said he'll put you in church y you better read what your Prophet has to say about sanctification see most people preaching sanctification is the beer bottles goes out the liquor goes out and this goes out but never preached like that he preach to Cleansing and claiming you don't believe in quitting no don't believe in quitting I believe believe in being delivered am that unclean Spirit goes out you better get something in place of it cuz brother brand says when it goes out see what goes out with that unclean Spirit it don't mean it wor out takes out everything see that we get all tied up in our mentality of thinking we understand no more than when we say you get a new spirit in a minute does that mean that brother collie that he you got your spirit and he takes it out puts no spirit in now that's that's not what the Bible's talking about that's right it's a conversion amen right it's converting that Spirit from an old adamic way to a new way but see when you get to the place he said and your Prophet said it like this he said he'll send you to church the devil don't like to hang out in the the Juke joints and the in the liquor Hogs and the things like that he don't want there he likes to go to church he's already got them people out there he's not concerned with them he wants to come to church cuz he likes to hear about God that's right he likes to know what you believe you see sanctification is a cleansing and set aside and then you got to have the fiery baptism to burn out what's left right now what's left if the unclean Spirit went out what's left you want to answer that now the unclean Spirit goes out of the Soul what's left you right right you why owe you that's what's left Y and what you a sinner Satan has perverted us sure we get new desires sure we want to go to church at sanctification Church you're looking at somebody that can witness to you for hours and telling you about what God done back there right I was a deacon at 23 years years old you know they had to think a lot of me cuz they seen my life they seen what I stood for and it wouldn't I stood for the Baptist Doctrine but I argued with them about it I told him the Bible said he that believeth I could read I never did believe you got the Holy Ghost when you believe that's right he said believeth in his baptized shall be saved means Keep On Believing right but see sanctification just cleanses The Vessel but the vessel's still there it's you now God has to come in and burn out what's left of you and I right amen and what if we don't yield it to him can he burn it out but brother Dale always stop getting the Holy Ghost just go to the Altar and pray for it jump up and grab it and run out yeah you go back and what are you now come on we've been around long enough a lot of you have been around long enough to see them in this message it claimed it and claimed it preachers and where are they now right I'm not already getting fussing with nobody I'm just telling it like it is you know yourself this is the biggest garbage cans of preachers has ever been ain't never been a Baptist Church that had the garbage can these preachers this message has got amen you got that right amen and then claim to still be saved at least in the Baptist you went out and done something wrong you did fall off and quit right now everybody but God don't God don't condemn me cuz I'm his son yeah but listen it says in the Bible the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire excuse me let me let put it correct says the baptism of the fire and the Holy Ghost right cu the fire comes to burn out what's left cleanse us put us to the place that God can come and live in right and give us the new birth now we jump over to Ezekiel yeah now we get over to where we are on Ezekiel and I just gave a few quotes for us to to read from because I didn't have that much time to bring a lot what I wanted to but it says a new heart verse 25 26 right a new heart will I also will I give you and a new spirit and I will put a new spirit will I put in you and then you go on down to the next verse and he said I'll put my spirit in you okay now I don't remember where I've got the right one or correctly but brother brandom says see there are three things he said one is a new heart right one is a new spirit and one of them is my spirit coming three things all right now see that's what's going to take place I give you a new heart now the Bible says he would take away what our Stony heart right and give us a heart of Flesh right see if you don't become condemned about your life of what you was then don't talk about salvation amen because in the Bible everybody always you know said what can I do to be saved in other words I'm a sinner something needs to happen so what does the preaching of the Gospel do it makes you realize you were born wrong of course that's why I'm against it that's why the people in this message you know they always was eternals and all this thing they never preach salvation to the people so how can the people get saved right now go ahead that's what you believe go ahead but I just still old fashion enough to just believe in that you must be justified Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost and have the new birth I never believed that this age now this going to be funny but it don't mean to be but wouldn't it be nice sisters for you to never have to go through in the birth of a baby you just go to the hospital and pick it up and bring it home that's what you're now I thought we believe that the natural type to spiritual right amen the justification water sanctification blood and the baby getting life you know coming with the baby I thought we believe that well now what how many of you went to the hospital picked up your baby you never went through nothing there you was one day you look like an old pregnant chaos cuz you never Rachel's W to be no farmer but you can have a cow that can have a false pregnancy brother Thomas am I right she looks this exactly like she's fixing the havat she's as fat as mud she is beautiful looking wobbling around just like every other pragnant cow but then one day I don't know what happens to her where the air goes out of her or what happens I don't know ain't none of my business I ain't a cow but all at once she's as skinny as rail why cuz it was a f what they call a false pregnancy but wouldn't that be something for all you sisters you know to go through the N9 months then you get rid fat you don't even you go up to the doctor and doctor I'm ready and he said okay here take your baby home no no no no no no now I'm just sorry I'm just I know that's arrogant and hateful and carnal but I just still believe it and I still believe to be born again that youve got to come to a place of realization that you're lost that's right brother dick telling me that so somebody there in the Presbyterian said well they didn't know they lost cuz he born in the church something like that me and him talking about one time so I was just born in the church or something yeah preacher wife or something yeah well she was a preacher's daughter preacher's daughter and she just well I saved all the time I never didn't know I was lost here well that's the way people are if you don't know you're lost y you don't know what's going on I never been lost but one time right and I I was concerned that time I wasn't concerned about myself I was concerned about somebody else but still I was lost one time I'm I'm I'm not a but I'm a Woodsman in the bases that I can walk in the woods and come back out I may come out three miles down the road but I'm going to get back out of there cuz that's what I talk to kids follow the branches follow the sound follow the doing but one time I was concerned but see if you've never been lost you don't know what it is to be saved right amen that's right you never realize you're lost you don't know what to be saved so that's what it means I give you a new heart I take away your Stony heart and give your heart of Flesh in other words make you the word that you will listen to God and hear the message and you know how that is you come to church and you sat down if you remember your experience you know you may have been to church alone your life whatever but then one day something just begin to deal with you you begin sitting there and you thought well I'm lost you know of course the way it is now everybody you know is always saved so they don't want to preach each other way but you just say but I'm lost I need to go to the Altar and you know the difference between the fact of you being condemned in your heart to go to the Altar and somebody coming down there trying to get you out of the Pew and take you to the altar my brother R said don't do that right he said you'll make them harder to get saved than it ever was right cuz you'll start dealing with them you know you need to be saved cuz your mama saved you Daddy Sav you want to go to heaven don't you where they're at you know see and that ain't doing nothing that's just condemning you and the bases that that's making you harder but when something actually comes over you that's right amen that you realize right I'm lost just don't wait until like the lady was that was a Sunday school teacher and everything you know but she wound up her last hours there and you remember the story of the Prophet tell you and she was screamed out she said I'm lost he said her real Soul came up before her amen he said she realized she was lost and said they shot her with a h hypo needle in other words kept giving her shots to put her out of it why because she was condemning them right right see that's right but you know what happened if you don't know what happened then I would pray for someday that God will deal with you but also remember the story The Prophet said when he he called out a girl one day and told her she needed to get right she said from the day You' done that she said I went down she said I could see my mother's Soul frying hell and life at it said here preacher you want something to drink you want something smoke see because she turned it down right right but you know what it is see people get under condemnation and then they'll go talk to the pastor well you believe the message don't you and don't come into my office and feel in condemnation and expect me to tell you you're all right right I'm not going to do it I'm going to tell you to deal with God about it you feel condemned you go deal with God about it because I not I don't have no quick fix to make you no Christian right you don't have to go two years like I did no that was my problem cuz you see I've seen through much of religion until when I come in this message that's all I seen was religion and a higher form than what we had as Baptist but thank God for the word that I heard and I knew the man then wasn't religion you know what I'm talking about I remember I know brother brandom I remember when hearing that even my wife said one day she said there's one thing about it if he done the things he said on that tape right there he had to be a prophet see that's coming to realization of Truth looking right it just blunt look at it straight I'm lost I need a savior right see then you repent right repentance to say God I'm sorry right I'm sorry Lord forgive me but you know it's hard for people to do today that rather by you in you Cadillac and say I'm sorry you know that's true instead of just saying I'm sorry because this is not the age of saying I'm sorry this is the ede I'm saying I'm okay but see then what happens I give you a new heart I give you a melon mellow how you say it mellow I mellow you down I'll bring you off of your high house I bring you down to a position to realize and if you don't realize that you're lost you'll never be saved right I don't care what you talk about that's it I don't care what you claim if you believe the prophet you believe him you as children what you are you that don't make no difference you got to have your own experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost just cuz Mom and Daddy had it doesn't mean you got it he said I give you a new heart right he said I give you a new spirit now I gave you the quotes there and they're on the internet and there's plenty of them just run it in new heart new spirit on your computer brother ran says he gave us a new spirit he said now that is where the Pentecostal was messed up he said cuz they thought when they got that new spirit that was it do you love God y you want to go to church you become happy things going on you know a new spirit he said but that's not the Holy Spirit he said that's just a new spirit he said because you couldn't stand your own self with your old Spirit now as I said a moment ago I don't believe that means no more than I give you I take away your Stony heart well you know there's no such thing as a stone on your heart if it is you dead okay there's no such thing so that just is showing you what's the situation they give you a heart of Flesh in other words it's melling you down softening you up that's what God is doing he shows us things he heals us and delivers us and helps us you know amen maybe you're fixing to have a wreck and you see it looks like something just supernaturally happened to you and then you just come out of you someone how did that ever happen maybe the Lord's trying to talk to me that's what it means to get a new heart right now when it said get a new spirit is not take your spirit out put another spirit in right it's to work upon that spirit and as I said this morning now even the quotes will sound like it but remember when you're dealing with a new heart and a new spirit and the Holy Spirit in you that's in the soul that is not in your body or in your spirit that's righten you don't get a new spirit to take out your old Spirit of memory reason conscience affections throw it all away and then you you got to start thinking over again no now just starts working on you right and he's working on you in your soul right but now words listen if he's working on you and your soul what was we talking about this morning then the Soul will dictate back out to the spirit of the Body Spirit right through the body it'll show there's a new spirit come in that Soul a new spirit on what not a new spirit coming in to live but a cleansing up a washing a set a side cuz Ezekiel doesn't cover justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost you read what your Prophet is he's not talking that way he's talking about the Stony heart meling you up he's talking about the new spirit being the old Spirit you can't stand yourself with he said then put my spirit in you he's not even I've looking through all this he's not talking about sanctification and time now the future home is explaining it so get what I'm saying the new birth takes place in your soul when you get a new spirit is in the soul it's not a new spirit coming into the soul it's a washing or cleansing amen that's right of the Soul it's not a you memory reason conscience and affection that's right it's in the soul where the new birth takes place everybody understand what I'm saying whether you believe it or not the new birth takes place in your soul not your body and your spirit am so when he said I give you a new heart that's not taking out your thum gizard you put your Mello one in there right that's in the soul cuz that's the heart of man it's the soul of man right and to give it a new spirit is not to put you another spirit in place of your old memory reason conscience right that's the problem right we still got that right we got to deal with that after the New Birth the new birth don't convert your natural Spirit right it don't birth your body right the only place that you birth that is in the soul amen and from that soul is where the new spirit will come new desires Prophet said what does he mean new spirit he said new desires am why because you'll start wanting to be motivated towards God right y a cleansing process is working within you justification and sanctification is working in the soul all right and see then when it does he said I put my spirit in you said th's the Holy Spirit he said but that's where you Pentecostals is that he said you get a new spirit he said I got it you get new desires you think you're saved right now I'm not going to ask you to answer this question only in your own conscience is there one person in here and you're looking at one that's going to tell you that didn't happen to me is there one person in here that can say well I just jumped up and grabbed the Holy Ghost it don't matter what these other things is taking place I just believed it I just believed every been right there once it just happened to me all that one time well if it did you still had to go through them process amen right you cannot have the new birth today without having justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that's right amen and you can't have it without justification chopping off you P sins sanctification dealing with your nature y but that's in the soul see we're trying to convert people in these body and spirit right that's what I'm trying to get to you if your new birth is not there right the day I got born again it didn't make me so worri I didn't remember what I used to do did it you when you got born again that's what I was asking did did it cleanse you so much day you got born again you just don't never have no more wrong thoughts and you don't ever remember what you used to do cuz remember that's in memory reason consciously right amen well I ain't never had a dirty thought since I got the Holy Ghost I'm like believe it was Jack Cole told that lady when she come up there and she said said Mr Cole said I want to lay my tongue on the altar he said said I just gossip and everything said I want to lay my tongue out here alar he said ma'am this P this alar is only 14 ft said there ain't enough room one come to him something one time that's why they didn't like once come to him one time brother T him he had a lot of f on and told him said you know said I got the Holy Ghost I ain't lied or done nothing he said the biggest liar here go shut down he didn't mind just bluntly saying it you're the biggest liar here just go sh down so you can't preach like you used to you know you offend people too much but listen since you're born again if you ever had wrong thought amen that's right can you think about what you used to do right my problem is I can't keep from thinking about what I used to do right right I mean I don't something wrong I ride by there I can still remember where it was at can't you well I thought maybe Christianity was a little different to the world it is but this is like brother rown said he said there's no such thing in the Bible where it promises you prosperity and things to be a Christian he said it promise you spiritual Prosperity but not natural right see but we're Tau come to the church and you'll have this you'll have that now you ain't never heard it around here right no I saying there this morning people thinks you know we just take one more step and everything going to get better and everything going to get better the econom is going to get better this going to be well when we go out here we're going to be living in a Utopia we go out here in a Rapture we'll probably be living in one of them concentration camps up in Alaska amen that's all right that your Prophet spoke of you said well you sure don't have much Faith well it's one thing about it I'm still preaching on it amen you know I'll preach it till we get it but see a new heart take away the Stony heart that's in your soul the stoniness of you the hardness of you M you down enough to worry that you'll want to repent you don't mow it down you can't repent cuz you don't you're too hard that's right then you repent you say Lord I'm sorry and he just chops off in P sins but just remember brother run said it didn't do nothing to the Future right right right amen he said only the past that's right there's no such thing as praying for the fure future sins that's Catholicism that's right where they allowed the people to come up and give the money and they it and told them to go ahead and kill people cuz they forgive it before they done it you can't do it that's not in the Bible God does not require you to repent of what you're going to do right wait till it's done right we might order repent for the fact of even thinking about we could get by with it but what does it say a new and a new spirit what he said a new desire I want to do right now I know I'm a Christian I'll smoke one more than I'll throw it away now I'm reading right here off the page that's on the first one that turned over to on impersonation of Christianity 7 120 why the spirit you had you couldn't even get along with yourself how you going to get along with God God had to give you a new heart not patch up one a new heart that's your intelligence that you think with a new way of thinking now listen I don't care if you can quote all day long memory reason conscious spirit Spirit real your soul is what makes that work okay that's why I deal with the soul I'm preaching to Soul I ain't preaching to bodies and spirits I'm preaching to souls because it's a soul that's iner what he said I just going on down in that now I know I'm a Christian I'll smoke one more then I'll throw it away see I'll just stay home tonight and you know I'll just all these little just Eve stopped for a moment that's all she had to do right new heart new spirit after you get a new heart and in new spirit you need God's spirit within you amen after then that that heart has been made mellow enough to repent and then God can use the word to drive that unclean Spirit out of you that's right you ever heard this statement I tell you what it might not be a good thing but for me to bust somebody gets boy it helps my spirit that's what it does it helps that old human well like I told a man at work down there one day he hit his hand or something he let out some word I said why didn't you say Thank you Lord I didn't M the thing off what good is all them words well it half my nature half my old Spirit we're getting rid of the old spirit amen amen say thank thank you Lord yes but he calls going down in that same message he talks about the new spirit sits in the center of the new heart you read these and you get home new spirit sets in the center of that new heart he said then he puts his spirit in there which is the m spring he calls it remember what we were saying the soul controls the spirit the spirit controls the body the main spring the thing that's controlling us then there's no problems with all these other things they become automatically in the process no I didn't have to quit anything to become a Christian that's what everybody preaches you got to quit this you got to quit that to become a Christian and I know exactly what's in your mind I talk to you and I listen to you if I could get good enough I'm just not good enough you're going to die and go to hell that way cuz you'll never be good enough right quick as you get rid of one thing Satan brings up another one right don't ever think that like I've always told you you say well I just don't feel like going to church today the devil says that's right that's right you go all the time you're a good dedicated person you go all the time you just stay out there cuz you don't feel like it he's on your side 100% ain't he until you look at the clock and you say they started the service at 10:00 and I'm not there and the devil says ha haa you proved you wouldn't a Christian you'd have went now he's not on your side he's condemning you right and he has a right to do it cuz he conquered you right that's right but you see when God puts his Spirit within us now comes into view the scriptures that you can't wait for the doors to open right right that's right amen you can't wait till the doors open what your the Bible says and your Prophet says it but see what do we do well if I could find a pretty good excuse you know like the old guy sitting down on two guys sitting down on the river you know and one of them said to the other one said boy I can hear that church bell ringing nor went to church the other one said yeah said I couldn't go anyway said my wife's sick okay pretty well fits to bill on it joke fit the bill yeah that's right see he said I put my spirit in you there's that part I was talking about where that he begins to work on that Soul because when you get that now I've got them on past this in the next message Wednesday cuz when you get the new birth you only get the earnest that's right of your inheritance that's right amen true brother R said your soul is not complete yet he only got the earnest so you get that new spirit placed within you and it's going to start working on us y see that's what Ezekiel was talking about that's what the Israel was going to go through you know what Israel is going to be one of these days now let's just say this for a minute we qu you see one of these days there 144,000 going to be called out right that's right amen they're going to get the new birth it will not put them in the body of Christ right I don't believe that right amen it won't put them in the body of Christ cuz the body of Christ done gone up the Rapture right but it'll be a new birth to them and I believe they'll have to go through a new heart a new spirit because that's what he says right they're going to go through what you go through right but they cannot be in the body of Christ right everybody understand that because they rejected it and it's not going to put them a second bride right you know we don't believe in stuff like that it only got one body one bride polygamy is going to be done away with one of these days you know it's going to be back to one Christ and one body all right so you don't have two all right so that 144,000 they're going to realize that they're lost they're going to realize they missed it and they're going to go through the stages that you and I have to go through to find a place right and when they do there's going to be a new spirit plac within them and that'll be the Holy Spirit and you know what they'll do then the Bible says they separate apart and cry that don't shout Glory Hallelujah I had it all the time they cry and they pray because they realized one thing that they've missed it right that they will not be the bride that's done gone but they'll realize that they're not like the rest of Israel that they're saved and that they will be in the millennial Reign the prophet said but they'll be servants to the bride you know that's not a degrade they won't be degraded and downrod my point is what's going to happen to Israel should be what's happening to you and I right amen we should be the happiest people in the world to think about that we're saved that's right that God God has given us all of this and brought it to us here in the end time and showed us all of the word amen made us his offspring but we've went through these processes come out of it with the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen see then you can only start the growth development from the time that the baby come into the world right you know the baby in the wound it grows right but still up to a part and it stops you know see then it's got to come out and it's got to start drinking milk and and then it's start got to eating potatoes and it's got to it's got to start growing and the nourishment that it needs for each stage you can't keep giving it milk right right amen you stunt to growth you got to feed it so is God done with a stature of perfect man to feed the bride in the end time do you understand then I believe as I said to start with that ever born again believer now I know this is coming out in is coming out odd to what people's going to think because of what the statement I make but I believe every Born Again believer if we'll just yield to that Holy Spirit within us we are not more than we are more than a match for the devil amen cuz greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world now we're not going to go out and say Satan I challenge you don't think that you're going to challenge him if you think you are you already got him in you cuz he's the only one that wants to challenge God don't challenge he accepts the challenge greater is he that is in you and he this in the world ever born again believer then by the baptism of the Holy Ghost can tell Satan say get out of here you know what you have to do you have to listen you know what you have to do let's get out of here long as you keep telling him just keep telling him see why because it's not you it's not you I'm not talking about you being a match for the devil I'm talking about the Holy Ghost is in you you understand the Holy Ghost in you is the more than a match for the devil but what do we fight with well Satan I tell you what now Jesus Took the word amen and said it is written what do we take right it is written brother R said if you can find anything in here that God said you can call him on the scene now this is a direct quote he said if he don't do it you can call him a liar I first read that I thought man oh man this guy really has a connection somewhere or he just he just goofing up one I mean that's what I thought I'm honest but then I begin to realize what he's talking about greater is he that's in you amen when that indwelling of the Holy Spirit comes in it converts our soul now listen see I don't mind all these quotes I love them it converts our soul to a new nature now after all of that you'd say well what do you mean you just you you look like you're going back and talking about this some your nature no the nature of your soul is God if you're born again right it's been converted to a new nature all I want is just more of him come on boys let's Stand Together come on musicians where's the song leaders come on boys think on these things thank on greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world number what 369 360 36 number 360 in the spiral book greater is he that is in you he that is in the world Amen anybody have a need the altar is open come and let's believe and let's
