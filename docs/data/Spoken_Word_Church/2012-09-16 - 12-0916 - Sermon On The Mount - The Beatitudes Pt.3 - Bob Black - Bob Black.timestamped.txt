[0:03] chapter I'll see you later buddy thank
[0:06] you thanks
[0:11] Tim Matthew 5 Matthew
[0:19] 5 from here man from here Matthew
[0:22] Chapter 5 Matthew Chapter 5 thank you
[0:26] we're working on our speech therapy over
[0:28] here right
[0:30] what it said is raise your hand or
[0:33] something if you can't hear me well if
[0:35] they can't hear you they can't raise
[0:36] their
[0:37] hand
[0:39] okay you can throw him too if you
[0:42] want can't hear me right make him stand
[0:44] in the
[0:53] corner you Lord we're recording all
[0:55] right all right so let's uh let's just
[0:59] start reading
[1:00] through uh the Beatitudes to kind of set
[1:03] the set the
[1:04] stage Matthew
[1:07] 5:1 and seeing the multitudes he went up
[1:10] into a mountain and when he was set his
[1:12] disciples came unto him and opened his
[1:15] mouth and taught them saying blessed are
[1:19] the poor in spirit for theirs is the
[1:21] Kingdom of Heaven blessed are they that
[1:23] mourn for they shall be comforted
[1:25] blessed are the meat for they shall
[1:26] inherit the earth blessed are they which
[1:28] do hunger and thirst out after
[1:30] righteousness for they shall be filled
[1:32] blessed are the merciful for they shall
[1:34] obtain Mercy blessed are the pure in
[1:36] heart for they shall seek God blessed
[1:38] are the peacemakers for they shall be
[1:40] called the children of God blessed are
[1:42] they which are persecuted for
[1:44] righteousness sake for theirs is the
[1:46] Kingdom of
[1:48] Heaven blessed are ye when men shall
[1:51] revile you and persecute you and shall
[1:53] say all manner of evil against you
[1:55] falsely for my sake rejoice and be
[1:57] exceeding glad for great is your reward
[1:59] in heaven for persecuted they the
[2:01] prophets which were before you and those
[2:04] last week often times we forget that um
[2:08] it's it's supposed to happen that people
[2:10] will despise us that will reject what we
[2:14] believe and I believe that kind of helps
[2:16] us it should help us help our help our
[2:19] faith and help our um confidence to know
[2:22] that it's written in God's word that
[2:23] that's how people will behave toward
[2:25] us so if you break these
[2:28] up you can kind of see the first four
[2:31] are God calling you the the attributes
[2:34] of the of of the people that God are
[2:37] calling the poor in spirit mourning
[2:41] meekness and then hungering hungering
[2:43] and thirsting for righteousness and when
[2:45] you when you start looking at these
[2:47] individually they overlap so much you
[2:49] can almost it's almost difficult to um
[2:52] see what's different between mourning
[2:53] and hungering for
[2:56] righteousness and then once
[2:58] you're if you hunger and thirst for
[3:01] righteousness you'll be filled so
[3:03] continuing on to the next
[3:05] four that God after God calls you and
[3:08] fills you with the Holy
[3:09] Ghost then you can be merciful you can
[3:12] be pure in heart peacemakers persecuted
[3:15] you won't be persecuted if you're if
[3:17] you're not uh you're persecuted for a
[3:19] reason because you're filled with the
[3:21] Holy Ghost and youve got you're
[3:22] manifesting God's
[3:27] word just to kind of
[3:30] put in uh maybe as simple as I can make
[3:34] it those first four the first one is I
[3:37] can't do it I'm poor in spirit I I
[3:39] realize God gives you a revelation that
[3:42] you need something from him and then you
[3:44] begin to mourn for sin mourn for sin in
[3:46] your own life mourn for sin in in your
[3:48] church in the world and the around you
[3:52] and then meekness is really in this
[3:55] context being able to be taught being
[3:57] able to be led that you can you want
[4:00] to be you want to find God
[4:03] so God gives you the ability to be able
[4:07] to be lead like a sheep Meek and lo just
[4:10] like Jesus and then longing to be
[4:17] filled I turn it
[4:22] off so let's um look at kind of compare
[4:26] on the this is The Sermon on the Mount
[4:28] and over in Luke he preached What's
[4:30] called the sermon on the plane let's go
[4:32] to Luke chapter
[4:35] 6 and four the Beatitudes are from
[4:38] Matthew are repeated here followed by
[4:41] four Wes kind of compare what's the
[4:47] U what's kind of the opposite of the
[4:50] woes kind of show you the opposite of of
[4:53] what happens if you don't receive these
[4:55] blessings so Matthew 6 verse 20
[5:01] l oh sorry Luke 6 verse 20 thank you and
[5:05] he lifted up his eyes on his disciples
[5:07] and said blessed be ye poor for yours is
[5:10] the kingdom of God blessed are you that
[5:13] hunger now for ye shall be filled
[5:15] blessed are ye that weep now for ye
[5:17] shall laugh blessed are ye when men
[5:19] shall hate you and when they shall
[5:21] separate you from their company and
[5:23] shall reproach you and cast out your
[5:25] name as evil for the son of man's sake
[5:28] Rejoice ye in that day and for Joy for
[5:30] behold your reward is great in heaven
[5:32] for in the like manner did their father
[5:34] unto the prophets but woe unto you that
[5:37] are rich for ye have received your
[5:40] consolation rich not in the things that
[5:42] God gives but rich in the things of this
[5:45] world that you keep up to yourself
[5:47] pleasures of the world instead of the
[5:49] things of Heaven woe unto you that are
[5:52] full you for you shall
[5:53] hunger full of the things we want to be
[5:56] full of of of God's word we look at what
[6:00] righteousness is in a second woe unto
[6:02] you that laugh now for you shall mourn
[6:04] and weep woe unto you when all men shall
[6:07] speak well of you for so did their
[6:09] fathers to the false prophets there's
[6:11] another place that's written in the word
[6:13] it's it's uh we shouldn't be dishearted
[6:16] when people speak ill of
[6:17] us because it's written in God's word
[6:20] that that will happen but I say unto you
[6:22] which here love your enemies do good to
[6:25] them which hate you bless them that
[6:26] curse you and pray for them which
[6:29] despitefully use you and unto him that
[6:32] smiteth thee on the one she offer also
[6:34] the other and him that taketh away thy
[6:35] cloak AB bite forbid not to take thy
[6:38] coat also so we look at that first one
[6:40] uh Luke
[6:44] 6:24 is the comparison to Matthew where
[6:49] he says the poor in spirit woe un you
[6:52] that are rich for you have received your
[6:54] consolation I'm just kind of going to
[6:55] run through these real quick so we can
[6:57] finish up May on hungering and thirsting
[7:00] for righteousness and then
[7:04] mning Luke 6:25 War unto you that are
[7:07] full for you shall hunger War you that
[7:10] laugh now for you shall mourn and weep
[7:13] compared
[7:14] to mourning for the sin in your in your
[7:18] own life the sin in your and around you
[7:20] in your family and in your church and in
[7:22] your the people that you associate
[7:25] with and brother renam said in uh
[7:32] there it is questions and
[7:35] answers sigh and cry for the
[7:37] Abominations that's done in the city
[7:39] where do you see that I can show you
[7:41] 10,000 speaking in tongues to one that's
[7:43] really burdened for sin that can't even
[7:47] pray an
[7:49] hour can't even pray an hour really true
[7:52] burdens for sin burden for wanting
[7:54] wanting to have a longing to have God
[7:57] more in your
[7:58] life
[8:00] and then uh the meek is not the meek is
[8:04] one not included in
[8:06] uh
[8:08] in in Luke and really that means um in
[8:13] your journey toward being fill with the
[8:15] Holy Ghost and your journey toward
[8:18] knowledge of God and and righteousness
[8:20] meekness is
[8:22] the opposite of self-will toward God and
[8:25] ill will toward men it's really being to
[8:27] sum it down it's being able to be being
[8:29] able to be led meek and
[8:33] lowly in James 1 through2 he said
[8:36] wherefore my beloved Brethren let every
[8:38] man be swift to hear slow to speak slow
[8:41] to wrath for the wrath of man worketh
[8:43] not the righteousness of God wherefore
[8:46] lay apart all filthiness and superfluity
[8:49] of naughtiness and receive with a
[8:51] meekness the engrafted word which is
[8:53] able to to save your souls that's being
[8:56] able to be tall to be able to receive it
[8:59] not being all Hardy and everything this
[9:02] is and 2 Corinthians 10:1 he said now I
[9:05] beseech myself second Corinthians 10 is
[9:08] just a great lesson in meekness cuz
[9:10] Paul's coming he says I I'm I'm
[9:12] beseeching you by the meekness and
[9:14] gentleness of Christ to impr presence
[9:16] and base among you base means just as
[9:19] low as you can get I'm not coming with a
[9:21] big Hy idea that I'm something big I'm
[9:23] coming to you in the Bas that only comes
[9:26] by a a true relationship with God I'm I
[9:29] know who I am but I know what I'm
[9:30] talking about too he said be being an
[9:32] advent and bold toward
[9:34] you and then move further on down and
[9:37] four five for the weapons of our Warfare
[9:39] are not carnal But Mighty through God
[9:41] who the pulling down of strongholds
[9:43] casting down imaginations and every High
[9:45] thing that exalts itself against the
[9:47] knowledge of God and bringing into
[9:49] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[9:51] of Christ that's that's real meekness
[9:53] when God up begin to tear down all of
[9:55] your own ideas and your own imagination
[9:58] that's right so he can put his word in
[10:00] you
[10:06] amen and true meekness is not weakness
[10:09] what people is you know a lot of might
[10:13] might have been taught before because
[10:15] true meekness will not compromise the
[10:17] principle of righteousness or compromise
[10:19] with evil there's a meekness of the
[10:21] world that um is is kind of like well
[10:24] maybe I guess the way best way to say is
[10:26] cifi that you'll let you'll let evil
[10:29] evil slip into your home and let evil um
[10:31] slip into your your life because you're
[10:34] you won't stand you don't you're not
[10:36] standing on the principles of
[10:37] righteousness right but true meekness
[10:41] that comes from God won will not
[10:43] compromise amen with with evil meekness
[10:47] restrain from private Revenge but
[10:50] doesn't conflict with the requirements
[10:52] of fidelity to God is calling his people
[10:55] now Moses was very Meek we know in the
[10:57] Old Testament it was written that he was
[10:58] the meekest man in all the Earth but
[11:01] when he came down off the mountain amen
[11:03] he
[11:04] saw he saw the children of Israel that
[11:07] had going against God's word and were
[11:08] going after that golden calf and he
[11:11] threw down the idols and slew every all
[11:13] the transgressions by the age of the
[11:15] sword and Christ was meek and lowly but
[11:19] he drove the desecrated from the temple
[11:21] with HS that he he bound up
[11:24] together in uh acts 16:37 Paul said
[11:30] they have beaten us openly condemned
[11:32] being Romans and have cast us into
[11:34] prison and now that they trust us out
[11:36] prively n verely but let them come
[11:38] themselves and fetch us out out of
[11:40] prison let them come fetch us out that's
[11:42] right in John 18:23 Jesus answered him
[11:46] if I have spoken evil bear witness of
[11:48] the evil but if well why smilest thou me
[11:52] m this doesn't mean you've got to be a
[11:58] and and I um I just let me tell
[12:02] you a little a few little stories that
[12:04] i' heard from Billy Paul giving
[12:05] testimonies one time uh he told his
[12:08] story of how his family was in a diner
[12:11] just to show you the two opposites
[12:13] extreme opposites of meekness this uh he
[12:15] was in a diner with his
[12:18] family and people he said bil Paul said
[12:21] people would um come up and and uh you
[12:24] know a lot of times people might take it
[12:26] try to not really meaning to but kind of
[12:28] take it vage said well can you come over
[12:30] to my house this afternoon or can you
[12:32] spend the weekend and and things like
[12:34] that and Billy Paul brother Brandon
[12:36] would would not uh say no I can't do
[12:39] that he just he'd leave it all up to
[12:40] Billy Paul and Billy Paul said he'd roll
[12:42] his eyes over to him like help me get
[12:45] out of this just just real Spirit of
[12:47] meekness he wouldn't say uh I ain't got
[12:50] time for none of that but he he just
[12:52] roll his eyes over to him and leave it
[12:54] up to Billy Paul to help him get out of
[12:56] that because he was trying to draw
[12:58] people to the word and didn't want to
[13:01] put anything in the way of somebody
[13:02] coming to the message but compare that
[13:05] to the time that he was in a diner when
[13:07] there was somebody at that little bar
[13:08] when he uh they they were swearing and
[13:11] cussing and these old uh fellas in the
[13:14] in the restaurant started swearing and
[13:16] cussing and uh brother brandham Billy
[13:19] Paul said he brother brandham got up
[13:20] from the table and Billy Paul is like oh
[13:22] no what's he going to do now and he went
[13:24] up to him and he tapped one of the
[13:26] fellas on the shirt on the shoulder that
[13:29] was um sweared up a storm and said are
[13:32] you going to put that
[13:33] food in that dirty
[13:38] mouth and he said that man turned meat
[13:41] in yeah right you know the real meekness
[13:45] is is when you have somebody backing you
[13:49] up right and brother Brandon had
[13:51] somebody to back him up right and that
[13:53] was the Holy
[13:55] Spirit now let's give a hunger and
[13:57] thirst for righteousness
[14:00] they that hunger and thirst for
[14:02] righteousness shall be filled and this
[14:04] to me when I was um seeking the Holy
[14:06] Ghost this was I really hung to this as
[14:10] as a promise that God I I I trusted God
[14:13] that his word would never fail and I
[14:16] hung on this that he would come to feel
[14:17] me now this doesn't this promise does
[14:20] not stop at the baptism of the Holy
[14:22] Ghost that's right it's it goes all the
[14:24] way up and uh I if I could summarize
[14:28] this I maybe summarize it as how close
[14:31] to God can you get are you ever
[14:33] satisfied with if you're ever satisfied
[14:36] with your condition that there's
[14:37] something wrong We should strive to get
[14:39] as close to God as we can
[14:43] amen that's that's the summary Luke 6:25
[14:46] woe unto you that are full for ye shall
[14:49] hunger woe unto you that laugh now for
[14:52] you shall mourn and we now if you're a
[14:54] fool now there's there's something wrong
[14:58] we we should always be striving to be
[15:00] closer to God
[15:01] Amen and Luke uh let's see I think
[15:07] uh this is kind of getting into a
[15:09] different topic but if you kind of look
[15:11] at the way that the Old Testament
[15:12] Tabernacle was laid out it kind of late
[15:15] it goes through your the whole journey
[15:17] of the Christian and when Jesus when
[15:20] when they found him in the temple he was
[15:22] in Solomon's porch just inside in the
[15:25] inside that outer court and what
[15:27] happened in Solomon's porch was they
[15:29] would come to hear the word they would
[15:31] come to learn and when you that first
[15:33] step when you go through those five
[15:35] gates of the outer Court you're in the
[15:37] first part of being called of uh and you
[15:41] begin to Crave to hear the word that's
[15:43] why it um I I think any Christian that's
[15:46] not hungering and thirsting to hear to
[15:48] God and to read more and to pray more
[15:51] all the time that there's something
[15:53] lacking in our life because that's
[15:56] that's really where it all begins at
[15:57] Solomon's torch
[15:59] that's where Paul listened to Galeo when
[16:02] uh Galeo and all the other scribes and
[16:04] the scholars would sit in Solomon's
[16:06] porch and teach in that first that first
[16:10] stage of the journey and then uh not
[16:13] going to get into it right now but
[16:14] moving on in through the in court into
[16:16] the holy of holies where they couldn't
[16:19] back then they couldn't do that because
[16:21] the holy of holies was closed off but
[16:22] now it's open to all
[16:24] us and I um I remember this when I was
[16:29] uh growing up I remember here this we
[16:31] went over to this uh some some brother
[16:34] and sister's house and there was this a
[16:35] minister brother from Texas and I I
[16:37] don't remember who he is but this his
[16:40] testimony left such a mark on my life
[16:42] and his testimony was that he was a
[16:44] drunker and one day he was going to the
[16:46] alcohol store and he heard about uh he'd
[16:49] been witnessed to maybe all his life and
[16:51] his his mom had told him about the
[16:53] message he was on his way to the alcohol
[16:55] store and he saw on the way a a vision
[16:59] of Christ over the street and he had his
[17:02] head down and he looked up at him the
[17:04] blood was dripping off but my point is
[17:06] that all of a sudden something was
[17:08] quickening in him and he went home and
[17:09] that weekend he read through the entire
[17:11] Bible in one weekend you tell me the
[17:14] spirit of God know somebody just like he
[17:16] was when Elijah ran before ahab's
[17:18] chariots to read the entire Bible in one
[17:21] weekend when that kind of echo my
[17:23] testimony when uh I mentioned before
[17:25] about how I was walking with my dad one
[17:27] day and he started telling me about the
[17:29] future home and something quickened in
[17:31] me and I could not keep wa you it it
[17:34] it's it's hard to uh growing up you know
[17:38] you're told over and over again to read
[17:40] the Bible study the message but when
[17:42] something happens something's quickening
[17:44] you you can't keep away from
[17:46] it and I I so I I think that's like the
[17:51] first stage of beginning the hunger and
[17:53] righteousness hunger and hunger for
[17:56] righteousness remember the story of the
[17:57] little boy that brother Bron told told
[18:00] about um he wanted to see God so bad and
[18:04] nobody could show him J and he went to
[18:06] his mama and she said well you need to
[18:07] ask the pastor so went the pastor he
[18:09] said no man can see God and live and
[18:12] finally he went to a deacon in brother
[18:13] br's church and took him fishing and the
[18:16] Deacon took him out on the water and he
[18:18] said I see God everywhere his old tears
[18:21] eyes teared up because there was God on
[18:24] the inside that's what we should be
[18:25] looking for not God when you got God on
[18:28] the ins side you can see God everywhere
[18:30] not just um something intellectual
[18:33] something that you're trying to prove by
[18:34] reading a lot or by coming in uh
[18:39] uh just uh a big fancy uh but what I'm
[18:44] trying to say y'all
[18:50] know so
[18:52] uh I start looking at some of these
[18:54] quotes hungering and thirsting for
[18:56] righteousness the lamb and the dve and
[18:58] said
[18:59] he he went to Oakland California and I
[19:02] thought this was real interesting he
[19:04] said I say this not to be any different
[19:06] from other any other city but I have
[19:08] found in this revival the most hungry
[19:11] and thirsty place that I have seen from
[19:14] New York to the West Coast and Skip on
[19:16] down it's about the only place that I
[19:18] found that a real genuine hunger is in
[19:21] the heart now this is in 1957 so he he's
[19:25] been to a lot of places a't that
[19:26] striking that out of all the places this
[19:29] is the only place that he could found
[19:31] that had a real true genuine hunger it
[19:33] just shows how rare it is to have such a
[19:36] craving in your heart to see how close
[19:38] you to get to God now I know now I know
[19:42] for when the anointing strikes me it's
[19:44] just one big blast out across this
[19:46] audience here and I know that you're
[19:48] hungry and God bless your hearts honey I
[19:51] hope that God just fills you so full of
[19:53] the Divine Love Of Christ until none of
[19:55] the modernisms and things will ever be
[19:57] able to separate you from the love of
[19:59] God that's in Christ Jesus stay with
[20:03] it the
[20:05] expectation he said then you want more
[20:08] of God you Hunger for More Of God and
[20:10] because that you do Hunger is a very
[20:13] fine evidence that there is more of God
[20:16] to
[20:17] receive you can't ever exhaust
[20:19] inexhaustible Fountain
[20:22] amen thirsting for life he said there's
[20:24] no satisfaction until that thirst is
[20:26] quenched by God's presence but the devil
[20:29] tells you you want to be modern and
[20:32] thirst he said The Thirst is an alarm
[20:33] it's an alarm plot that's thirsting the
[20:36] soul sets off alarm clock a little
[20:38] buzzer inside of you to tell you that
[20:40] death is lurking night that if you don't
[20:42] get water pretty soon you've got to die
[20:45] and it gets louder and louder until
[20:47] finally you keep putting it off and
[20:48] you'll die because it's an alarm clock
[20:51] and I I found that to be true even after
[20:53] receiving the Holy Ghost right that if
[20:55] you go for too long without praying you
[20:57] something something something got to
[20:59] give you got to uh if you go too long
[21:02] without reading the Bible or getting
[21:04] down getting down with God until you
[21:06] have been laid under the fountain for a
[21:09] while then uh you just it's hard to
[21:13] stand
[21:15] and and thirst he said
[21:19] um make sure I'm on the
[21:25] right down on the bottom I have nothing
[21:27] against uh
[21:29] going to church which is you know we try
[21:31] to satisfy a lot of time satisfy that
[21:33] thirst for many different things and
[21:35] churches might be one of them that isn't
[21:37] the satisfaction it's to find God the
[21:39] Living God the god of Heaven into your
[21:41] soul that satisfies that longing and
[21:44] thirsting that you long
[21:51] for if you want give that thirst the
[21:54] right place in your life and want thirst
[21:56] and take the things that God provided to
[21:57] stop that thirst with to quench it then
[22:00] Satan will lead you to some of his
[22:01] stagnant cesal of this world you must
[22:04] have it somewhere if you can't find food
[22:06] you eat from a garbage can but there is
[22:09] no reason for that when you're thirsting
[22:10] for God because God is a living God
[22:27] Amen God makes a promise and then comes
[22:29] around and fulfills that promise that's
[22:31] the interpretation of the promise and I
[22:34] would dare anybody to take God at his
[22:36] word see every word in that Bible isn't
[22:39] the truth that's right that's where that
[22:41] thirst is in there amen so just to end
[22:45] I'll finish with a little story that was
[22:51] um
[22:55] um I hope you'll take this right um this
[22:58] is story that uh somebody told me about
[23:01] this uh they were having a Revival down
[23:04] in in Florida one time years ago and
[23:06] Billy Paul and some other brothers were
[23:08] down there and this brother it was a
[23:10] minister brother that actually married
[23:11] my uh brother-in-law Monica's brother
[23:15] and um the power power of God was just
[23:19] was just present that uh spirit of the
[23:21] Lord was there and this brother actually
[23:23] died and they took him to the
[23:25] back and they um he been dead for 30 to
[23:29] 45 minutes and uh they took him back and
[23:32] Billy Paul and this other brother that
[23:34] actually relayed this story was back
[23:36] there and uh Billy they went to pray and
[23:39] Billy Paul said okay the angel is here
[23:42] and they prayed for him and the man came
[23:43] back to life later on after that he
[23:46] married um my uh my Monica's brother and
[23:52] uh it was it was told to me that this
[23:55] other brother and I I won't name his
[23:56] name right now but he said said
[24:00] uh you know that the presence of the
[24:02] Lord in that meeting was so strong and
[24:04] so great and the power of God came down
[24:07] and raised up this brother from the dead
[24:09] and and you a lot of times you think
[24:11] I've heard people say well you know all
[24:13] week I look forward to get in the
[24:16] presence of God feeling that presence
[24:18] that I feel at church that you kind of
[24:20] get in your head that you can only have
[24:22] that Presence at one time in your life
[24:25] but this particular brother said you
[24:26] know you can have that same presence of
[24:29] that same anointing that same power of
[24:31] God that was in that meeting where that
[24:33] brother was raised from the dead you can
[24:34] have that same presence every day of
[24:36] your life am every day when you wake up
[24:39] in the morning when you go to bed at
[24:40] night and that really struck to me who
[24:42] said that was not really important the
[24:44] point of it
[24:46] is and we should always be striving
[24:49] whenever you think I've I've met the max
[24:52] that I the maximum amount of my
[24:55] relationship with God there's there's a
[24:57] problem right cuz you can never exhaust
[24:59] the inexhaustible Fountain of Life you
[25:01] should always be striving to see how
[25:02] close we can get to
[25:05] God
[25:07] so with that in
[25:09] mind let's
[25:11] go Matthew 14
[25:27] take
[25:31] hungering and thirsting for
[25:33] righteousness Matthew 14 verse
[25:37] 13 through
[25:39] 16 and this this little story that just
[25:43] has so much in it you you think well uh
[25:46] it's just a story it's a story of God's
[25:48] Crea power God's providing for us but um
[25:52] there's just so much you can get out of
[25:54] the fish and lo story
[25:56] right Matthew 14
[25:59] 13 now people had seen they had seen
[26:03] God's word being fulfilled in this man
[26:07] that had come on the
[26:09] scene so they were they were after they
[26:11] were something in them hungry and thirst
[26:13] time verse 13 when Jesus so John had
[26:17] been beheaded in prison when Jesus heard
[26:19] of it he departed then by ship into a
[26:23] desert Place apart cuz he he he had
[26:26] emotions just like every one of us
[26:28] when he heard John had then beheaded it
[26:31] it struck him you know um CU he loved
[26:33] John and when the people had heard
[26:36] thereof they wasn't just going to sit
[26:38] still they followed him on foot out of
[26:41] the
[26:42] cias and Jesus went forth and saw a
[26:45] great multitude and was moved with
[26:47] compassion toward him and he healed
[26:49] their sheep and they followed him on
[26:51] foot out of the city probably without
[26:53] any respect for carrying food or uh
[26:57] taking care of anything the natural boy
[26:59] that's when you'll really find something
[27:01] when you just when everything in this
[27:02] world just just a dropway and say I
[27:04] don't care how long it takes or what's
[27:06] going to happen I want to be filled with
[27:09] the righteous righteousness of
[27:13] God and when it was evening his
[27:16] disciples came to him saying this is a
[27:18] desert place and the time is now passed
[27:22] send the multitude away that they may go
[27:24] into the villages and buy themselves
[27:26] VI the said Jesus said unto
[27:30] them they need not depart they don't
[27:33] need to depart because I am the word I
[27:35] am the bread of give you them to eat so
[27:39] this this little lesson right here is if
[27:41] you want it God will provide it you'll
[27:44] feel
[27:46] you then let's go to
[27:52] uh Luke
[27:57] 11
[28:01] that we're very all very familiar with
[28:10] this chapter
[28:13] 11 let's just start at verse
[28:16] one and it came to pass that as he was
[28:19] praying in a certain place when he
[28:21] ceased one of his disciples said unto
[28:23] him Lord teach us to pray as John also
[28:27] taught his disciples and he said unto
[28:28] them when you pray say Our Father which
[28:30] are in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy
[28:32] kingdom come thy will be done as in
[28:34] heaven so on Earth give us day by day
[28:37] our daily bread what's our daily bread
[28:40] his righteousness right and forgive us
[28:42] our sins for we also forgive everyone
[28:45] that is indebted to us and lead us not
[28:48] into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil
[28:50] and he said unto them which of you shall
[28:52] have a friend and shall get go unto him
[28:54] at midnight and say unto him friend lend
[28:57] me three Lo for a friend of mine is in
[28:59] his journey and his journey has come to
[29:01] me and I have nothing to separate for
[29:03] him and he from within shall answer and
[29:05] say trouble me not the door is now shut
[29:08] and my children are with me in bed I
[29:11] cannot rise and give Thee I say unto you
[29:14] though he will not rise and give him
[29:15] because he is his friend yet because of
[29:17] his impunity he will rise and give him
[29:18] as many as he needeth and I say unto you
[29:21] ask and it shall be given you seek and
[29:24] he shall find knock and it shall be open
[29:26] unto you for everyone that asketh
[29:28] receiveth and he that sheth findeth and
[29:30] him that knocketh it shall be open now
[29:33] this is really specifically for the Holy
[29:36] Ghost but generally for you remember God
[29:39] brother said God wants you to ask for
[29:41] big things after you get the Holy Ghost
[29:43] don't stop there if you want in James
[29:45] chapter 2 it says if you want Wisdom ask
[29:48] God to give you wisdom if you want
[29:50] knowledge ask him to give you knowledge
[29:52] sir if you want uh if you want to know
[29:54] how to raise your kids ask him to give
[29:56] you wisdom to raise your kids if you
[29:58] want to be a better Christian a better
[30:01] everything big things and you think a
[30:03] lot of things big things are are you're
[30:06] real sick so I'll ask God to hear you
[30:07] that's such a small thing that's what
[30:09] brother said that's a small thing the
[30:11] big things are knocking down the
[30:14] strongholds in your
[30:17] life the parable of fatherhood verse 11
[30:20] if a son shall ask bread of any of you
[30:22] that is a father will he give him a
[30:24] stone or if he ask a fish will he for a
[30:27] fish give him a
[30:28] or if he shall ask an egg will he offer
[30:30] him a scorpion if ye then being evil
[30:33] know how to give good gifts unto your
[30:35] children how much more shall your
[30:37] heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to
[30:38] them that ask him amen and what about
[30:41] all the other things not just the Holy
[30:43] Spirit once you receive the Holy Holy
[30:46] Spirit you can with confidence come to
[30:48] God believing that he hears and answers
[30:50] your prayer and will give you out of the
[30:53] abundance of his of his kingdom all the
[30:55] things that you need and ask for not not
[30:58] silly stuff like I want to win the
[30:59] lottery but the things that are written
[31:00] in his word the promises that he's made
[31:02] to you and uh we're almost out of
[31:07] time let's look at one more slide
[31:09] Philippians 384 to
[31:13] 14 Y doubtless and I count all things
[31:16] but lost for the Excellency of the
[31:18] knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for
[31:20] whom I have suffered the loss of all
[31:21] things that we count them but D that I
[31:24] may win Christ well that's pretty
[31:26] powerful is it mhm he counted everything
[31:28] as D that he might win
[31:31] Christ and be found in him not having my
[31:34] own righteousness which is of the law
[31:37] but that which is through the Faith of
[31:39] Christ the righteousness which is of god
[31:42] by faith that I may know him in the
[31:45] power of his resurrection and the
[31:46] fellowship of his sufferings being made
[31:48] con formable unto his death if by any
[31:50] means I made Might attain into the
[31:53] resurrection of the
[31:54] dead so uh this is just leading into
[31:58] next time we're going to see what
[32:00] righteousness is and how important it is
[32:02] amen because uh if you don't have
[32:04] righteousness his righteousness is the
[32:06] only only thing that will meet God's
[32:08] requirement not my righteousness or
[32:10] righteousness by the law but the
[32:13] righteousness that will let us attain
[32:15] into the resurrection of the Dead amen
[32:17] and let's stop there amen
[32:26] amen
[32:46] on
