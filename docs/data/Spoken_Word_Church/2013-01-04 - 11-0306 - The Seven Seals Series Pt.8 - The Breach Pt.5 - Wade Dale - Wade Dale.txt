========================================

you were late I almost took over maybe that'll be helped right there Joe just about um it's exactly now 10:00 and that CL we're okay Revelation 5 good morning everyone Revelation 5 all right Revelation chap 5 and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals I saw a strong Angel Proclaim with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look their own and as we said Wednesday night there's John a born again believer for 60 years he's crying because something has not taken place and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and read the book Nei to look there on now I want to ask you a question at this point of the scene where John is like we're talking about Wednesday night and I'm going to kind of back up a little bit and maybe redo Wednesday a little bit but not much but you see where John says I saw I saw I saw I John is in a place to where he's watching a scene he's he's let's bring it up to 2011 he's sitting and watching television or a movie screen because that's what it is there was a projection in the mind the mind of God is being projected out and here's John looking at a scene in chapter four he saw the scene chapter 5 he sees a scene chapter 5 he sees a scene that he don't really understand to a degree all right because remember was born again excuse me for 60 years but yet there was a part that he couldn't understand and to just back up and just stop for one moment and realize that that's what man's always looked for you remember the quote I gave Wednesday about where brother R said job job could see the flowers they go they grow they' die they come right back up he said but I see man go down and I don't see man come back up right but then when eloh the last one came to job which was the type of Christ cuz he start speaking in the first person telling job things he said job he said in other words this is going to happen that's going to happen this is what's being done in the safe time we won't read it but he has come to a place to where job was looking at no hope job knew knew that he remember job lost everything he thought God you know he thought he had done something wrong thought God had turned his back on him he said oh I wish that I could in other words if I could get to God you know but now remember let's tie all this together you take the Rich Young Ruler that went to hell and what did he tell he said go tell my brethren not to come to this place but he said I see Abraham I mean I see the the the beggar remember that died he said I see the beggar in the bosom of Abraham what did he say he said oh that I may go there and the angel tells you know in the story The Angel tells tells the Rich Young Ruler said you can't go there there's a great golf fixed a golf fixed which was fixed back in the Garden of Eden when Adam did what he did and Eve all right that was a great Gulf in other words once you're on this side you can't get across but when you're alive you can you can you know accept Christ and get across this is the point I'm making but all that was the point I'm trying to tell you all down through time man has wanted to be to where they can converse with God cuz Adam and Eve remember Adam and Eve conversed with God face to face didn't have to go through a prophet didn't have to go through a preacher they went they went straight to God and that's what Adam and Eve enjoyed and I believe that's what killed Adam more than anything not physically but you know I mean in his Spirit it killed Adam to not be able to talk to that same God again all right so man has since Adam begun trying to get back even in the Book of Psalms David says in Psalms 10 and something I I just thought I'd stop here for a second and go through this he says Heaven and Earth has kissed you know Heaven and Earth has come together David was prophesying he was seeing something that was coming but man is always job is always said old that a man could take my hand and take God's hand or that I could go up to the door and knock on the door and say God I want to talk to you face to face well you know what you take the old uh story that brother randam gave of the boy eating the rubber off the bicycle tire or the bicycle Pebble he needed sulfur the Deep was calling to the deep but there had to be a deep there there there had to be a sulfur if you're if you're craving like we were talking about if you were craving water Lisa said she drank a lot of water at night cuz she crave water well if there was no water or no such thing as water she'd never have that crav okay she'd never have that but there was water there so what am I saying there's a way to get back to God it was all down through the Old Testament and even in the New Testament there was a way to get back to God but it hadn't come yet it was in in Jesus Christ because God and man had to become one in flesh right so that's what like was talking about in the Bible Study last night it has to be the son of man to take that book spirit of God can't die God right here this this Son of God the spirit one we talk always talked about back in the Old Testament that that one sitting on the throne with that book in his hand he can't die he's almighty God Amen but the one that came out of the throne around from the throne in other words another Act of the plague John is sitting there watching and he's watching the story go across here comes one that appears but it's not somebody different it's the same person but in different dispensation or different action all right different characteristics he's he's given more of hisself he's unfolding more of himself that's why in Revelation 5 like I told you in here is the change of the body right there in Revelations 5 when that lamb took that book what was the book got to go back we got to see that there in the book there's two sections several sections really but only one let's talk about right now you got a section in there that your name was written in when you were born the prophet explains this your name was written in there when you were born as a human being on the face of the Earth everybody has that then there's a day when your name was transferred out of that just book of the living into the Lamb's Book of Life when you accept it now it's not somebody up there we don't there's not secretaries recording it right remember always in God it's already finished you and I are the ones that's got to see it right you and I are the ones that's got to see this this scene God's the one creating the scene okay the author of the book does not have to per se read the book to understand it why he wrote it that's right he did it he's the one that done all the work okay so here we got this book now remember one thing Adam was going to the ability to his flesh being changed to be Eternal that's what the prophet said his youth was being renewed but somewhere down the line his body would have become Eternal right that's why he he had to go through a chain I mean he wasn't he wasn't Body Spirit and soul Eternal he was Spirit Eternal I mean Soul Eternal everybody understand that cuz into Adam when he breathed eternal life into he breathed the breath of life into Adam that was directly eternal life imparted to a human being okay to make him Eternal in his soul same way at the new birth with you and I but our bodies were still getting older right same way with this book the book that the man sitting on the throne was holding on to was the book of the names of the people that were going to be changed does everybody understand that yes cuz if you're not a Christian your body's not going to be changed you're just one day you're just going to go away that's right I'm talking about you're just going to go out of existence never to be remembered again does everybody understand that that's how Revelations 5 to me is really the whole Bible because what what Adam took away from I mean what God took away from Adam was not the ability to be Eternal in his soul he took the book from Adam to say Adam you can't produce these names in flesh and they be changed and I'm holding up this because the last day right this one that was the last day okay right so the book that the man was holding on the throne was not necessarily John's eternal life he already had it all the souls that were there that were there were eternal life in their soul they were newborn creatures newborn like we were talking about last night you can't take that away so there's a part of that in in here just like the transfer of the name now God didn't transfer in race your name out and put it over here no it was when you realized that your name was always written on there it was just revealed right see it was just revealed this Bible was written before the foundation of the world but um it wasn't this little book right okay so what what God took back from Adam was not a book right he grab a big book you know and they get in a struggle he no that's mine no it was the ability for Adam to make this book come alive that's right in flesh not not in Soul because Adam was already Adam didn't lose eternal life in his soul he lost the eternal life the ability to become Eternal in this man right here right because his youth was being renewed he was eating perfect food he probably could have lived millions and millions of years but somewhere God's going to have to change that body cuz he brought it out of the earth okay Jesus body was the same way come out of the earth and you know it was made by God but it came out of the earth and even that didn't stop the corruption in this guy right here he still began to get older okay so what was what was John John's abor again Christian for 60 years he sees a man sitting on the throne with a book in his hand the Lord Jesus that b now John knew is born again okay but something about this book had to be transferred cuz if it stayed in the hands of the original owner which was God nobody was going to live forever that's right but the law of kinsman says somebody's got to be kin to you to get it back through man it fell through man has got to come back you say well it's just simple Redemption I wish you Redemption is not simple but yet it's the simplest thing you ever think about in your life how how the almighty God the Man Standing on the throne sitting on the throne declared just like Moses if Moses hadn't gotten a breach with them people what would have happened God said in the Ten Commandments Thou shalt not this this this and this and this without Moses standing in the breach for those people they died Moses portrayed Christ without Jesus Christ standing in the middle between me and and God I die because judgment this is Judgment if you're not written in here what is it it's judgment all right so the man sitting on the throne with a book John sees the man with a book it's closed it's got seals wrapped around it m so he knows one thing for sure nobody's ever read it like they were supposed to now look we always say it's the Bible but it's not a physical Bible that's what we're trying to get into last night there was a question we got to start stop looking at physical happenings like sister Gwen said a throne throne is your heart that's where God is he was already sitting on a throne he was already see he wasn't standing up he was sitting on the throne of your heart you were already born again so he saw that man sitting on the throne he always he said okay I'm born again that man is right here in my heart but this book's got some seals on it and no man was even worthy to even look at the book man the people that were there but then let me make more one more thing give back one more thing when the lamb took the book he opened it he had to cuz Revelations 10 you see it open but just him taking the book May John shout we'll read in just a minute just taking the book because John knew then there was an ability now but see there was no ability for them to be born again I mean to I'm sorry to be Eternal in their soul I'm about 20 minutes ahead of myself let me back up there was no way for John to stand there and know that he was standing in the right place to take a change because he he knew he was looking at a scene that was coming that was not you know that was not there for him right because he didn't ever open this book he never got the open book everybody understand that he didn't get the open book there only one people that gets an open book and that's you and I right okay so he he knew but still enough of that he knew then that once that man that come around and once he took possession of that book he knew it was in a man's hand a man that was worthy a flesh man the one we talked about remember Son of God and son of man right that son of man was Worthy now John saw somebody in human flesh that was worthy and John knew that that was the same Jesus he walked with and he remembered in his mind the Holy Ghost brought back what the word to his remembrance remember he said he said whatsoever things I say to you in other words I'll send the Holy Ghost and when he comes that he'll bring to you remembrance all the things I've said so here's John looking at Jesus heard all all the things he said I'm going to be the comforter I'm going to come back I'm going to do this saw Jesus in a glorified condition and knew he was okay then he knew the whole human race was all right just because of that one man right that one man not just Jesus Christ that's going to give like the denominations you know oh I believe in Jesus and he's he's going to save me and you know I I'm I'm going to get I'm this this is not good enough so I'm no when he resurrected he resurrected in a flesh body he ate food but he was glorified John saw glorified Jesus standing there on Earth didn't didn't know it doesn't say that but if he saw Jesus standing on Earth glorified he knew one thing for sure if he was almighty God he wasn't any different than what he saw so you understand what I'm saying he didn't lose position okay cuz John saw him on Earth and John as a young boy saw Jesus standing there glorified walk right through a wall Ascend straight up and just disappear out of their sight but when he saw that same man walk around behind that throne and grab the book and come up and sit down on the throne that's why John began to scream and shout right he seen the glorify Jesus on Earth so that man wasn't any less so now we got a chance go now we got what God and man has come together and through the baptism of the Holy Ghost John was joined together but this book was not all complete it was still shut till Jesus took it when he sat down on the throne somewhere he opened it Revelations 10 somewhere that book got opened when in the end time now not to say that it was totally sealed up because remember through this you get your New Birth through the word of God that's right right that's where you get your new birth a man with the Holy Ghost has to teach you the word and then you accept that right find me in the book of Acts any any any time the Bible says and as the word was being spoken the Holy Ghost fell on the people after the preaching of the word at day of Pentecost what if Peter just walked out and said bless God we're all Eternal that wouldn't work he said men and Brethren let me tell you about this man y'all killed that he is Jesus Christ and he's the one that come to die for your sins in other words that's what the whole the whole sermon was about right right now he didn't jump in there and start talking about he's going to change your body and he's no that's all they can understand that's right right all down Through the Ages even the great ages that's all they could understand was that one day right one day that's right God's going to come and I really don't understand but one day we're going to heaven right I was telling somebody last night most people in the message and all the people in denominations think that just because Jesus came to die that there's a place on the calendar written right here that says going to heaven that's not true that's not true he didn't just pick a day that he's going to heaven just because we do this just because Jesus came everybody thinks they're going to heaven that's not true there's a specific day specific time specific season that all these things had to come about and John standing in the first church age he has a a true revelation of one God if if not he wouldn't have shouted his trinitarian idea when he saw them two people standing there would have said okay there's two where's the Holy Ghost you know in other words I got the Holy Ghost here and there's Jesus and there's God that's the way that trinitarian ideas would have seen it but John being full of the word that Jesus preached he knew that that man was almighty God he just couldn't get it all together that scene brought it together for him cuz remember like I said Wednesday night he started out with I saw I see and boy at the end it was a us we and they what John had become one with a vision cuz he taed the bride right he become one with it and there was no Gap anymore that's right and if he would have had a present day Revelation he would have took a Rapture because present day Revelation was that God and man was truly one the son of man was back in power not sitting on that throne but sitting on this Throne the son of man sitting on the throne not the Son of God the son of man sitting on the throne everybody understand that all right because what happen right here watch verse eight let's skip on verse eight cuz we know what happened through all the other part cuz see he's are rooting off Spring of David verse 5 has prevailed to open the book and loose the Seven Seals thereof John saw that man probably saw in the scene he saw the book with those Seven Seals wrapped on it and he saw you know the bloody lamb take the book and then climb up the throne and here he starts doing this he starts tearing those seals off and then he flops that book open when he flops that book open that's when the shouting began cuz John knew that there was nothing closed anymore there was nothing left there was no mystery that's why brother Brandon reads Revelation 5 then he goes over and immediately reads Revelations 107 he said now this book is open he said but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mystery one mystery shall be finished so John knew that's why I believe like like Daddy preaches it and I can see it myself that Revelations 10 go to Revelations 10 just a second Revelations 10 is in three parts I've got it kind of underlined and sectioned out in my Bible and see if this is not true excuse me Revelation 10 1-6 shows another scene is that correct Jose the seene a mighty angel coming down clothed with Cloud Revelations 1 um Revelations 5 4 all those are showing the same man and had in his hand a little book open so John seeing this scene look at verse 7even that's not a scene see verse 1-6 I've got it marked in my Bible scene one see second scene 10:7 that's not a scene he's not seeing anything he's telling you how this is all going to happen cuz remember John's been through all the church ages watching watching Revelations 5 54 all the way down to six 7 8 n now he's in 10 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel now seventh angel I don't believe was standing there I believe in John's in John's Revelation or in his the quickening of the holy spirit in his life he knew that that could only happen in the end time when all the Mysteries will be wrapped up cuz he saw the book closed there first then he you know he saw the church AG saw the book that was closed then he sees 6 7 and 8 when the seals were open sees a Prophet come on the scene somewhere in all that see verse one is the scene verse two is is John telling you what's going to happen but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as Heath declared to his servants the prophets John takes it all the way back even to Revelations 3:14 the beginning of the creation of God right then I got another line and then number three takes him right back to the same scene in in section in one everybody see that watch this Mighty Angel come down all right I'm going to paraphrase follow with me fast Mighty Angel comes down swears by him that liveth forever and ever stop John makes a commentary but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound all these Mysteries are going to be finished stop verse eight and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go take a little book now John picks back up the vision again okay you got that brother Jo you understand it now okay good I saw a few lights going on some were down some are still a little down if you don't understand it raise your hand don't be don't be shy if you really don't understand I'll go over it again but see right watch this verse 1 through 7 or six aing does everybody see that yes there's a scene John is looking at something M and he's writing the comment until he gets to number six or five there four and five and he and God says what hold it right don't write that John's a little bit worried cuz John heard from the angel he should write everything you see right and what he said he should write everything you see John sees a scene of the seven Thunder he's in that but he says don't write it John as a born again Christian just like you and I would watch it verse one through six is 1 2 3 4 five six stop what was Brother D explaining b day last night for those you that were here there's always a pause or a stop between number six and number seven for you to think about something something's coming God's fixing to bring something so God did the same thing with John in verse 1 through6 he brought a scene down and right there at four and five John gets in a little he get something thrown a little curve thrown at him don't write this don't write this this is the most important thing ever going to happen on the face of the Earth don't write it when he gets to number seven number six I mean he stops and I believe John he's sitting there and he's writing all that down and he said no John don't write that okay well how's this going to get to the people cuz I'm writing this for a future age I'm John now I'm writing this for a future age Angel what is going on what why can't I write this down Holy Spirit strikes John he says oh but in the days of the voice of the Sabbath Angel when he begins to sound these seven things I can't write are going to be made known right okay you got a breach right which was the what a breaking forth a breach of something then verse seven does what explains how that scene's going to unfold with nothing written down you can't write a revelation exactly right then go back to verse eight and he puts it right back together everybody see that now he puts it right back together verse eight is the bride and Christ together John one man John typed the entire bride no one was able to eat the book until after John went through 1-6 and he had to stop in verse seven and ver between verse 6 and 7 and he had to think for a minute what's going to bring all this to pass oh that great angel in number in church age number seven that said he was the beginning of the creation of God now not brother brandom but Christ coming back to be the son of man on Earth again cuz you're going to set on my throne we're going to sit on Jesus's throne in the throne just as he sat with the father in his throne what does that mean what did he pray in John 17 that we may all be one one to me that's the Lord's Prayer John 17 the one saying Our Father which aren't in heaven and all that that's good but boy in John 17 he actually put a prayer out to the to the Bride of Jesus Christ now John picks up he said okay he go he reverts all the way back he said all right in the days of the voice of the seventh angel all this is going to happen okay I'm satisfied now let's go into eternity what's an eight Eight's eternity let's go into an eight and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel now who was that who was the angel that had the book in his hand Christ he picked right back up with Christ in the first the mighty Angel remember brother R said Christ is only could be that's right all right and we're going to read that next Sunday we're going to read out of the uh out of the book what we just studied today I think that's what we're going to do huh oh that's right next Sunday we may be at brother Al's church we I'll let somebody know probably a day before maybe a couple hours I don't know um I'll call you Sunday morning somebody Terence what Terrence ter Terence that's a good idea ter Sunday morning okay and let's finish this and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go take a little book so it's not a great big Revelation it's a little book fear not L on flock cuz that book that book right there is a specific book that's the book of the names of the Eternal that's Christ made manifest in flesh cuz when John takes that book now look at John John sees that book went from no way I can make it till somebody takes that book and not only keeps it nope that's not what he come for he come to give it back out right MH John saw that same book it didn't book didn't change it just changed ownership because remember you and I are the rulers of the earth God told us that not that's not something that we make ourselves right God always wanted go back to 10 years ago my statement isn't always will be God always wanted to one dwell in human flesh two have me and you dwell in human flesh and always be where he could get to us on this Earth You Know in other words conversion with us that's his whole plan you put all that all these thousands and millions of people and years and times and and and and U messages and doctrines and all that but you can sum it up in one just that one two three God always wanted to be in human flesh and what what God always wanted he's going to have that's right he always wanted me and you to dwell in human flesh Eternal and live on an ET Earth you know why cuz that's what we're going to and God can't change his mind about his word but see John here in Revelations 108 go take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth who was that Christ and I went unto the angel the Bible says come boldly to the throne of grace and I went to the angel and said unto him give me the little book now possession we know on the earth is 99% of the law and he said who Christ he is still that Mighty Angel he Christ said take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took that little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up he didn't leave a page out for what baptism and leave a page out for no eternal hell you understand what I'm saying the the doctrines that people have or or two souls or seven Thunders let's make it now he didn't leave them Pages out of the book he ate it all up now John should have known then and he did by a by a little bit of a revelation because you never see that book again you never see this book until Revelation 20 at the white Throne judgment it never talks about a book from that scripture from Revelations 10 all the way through remember 19 we come riding back what from the Millennium and you know riding back with him in the Millennium then we go through a millennium and then you see in Revelation 20 or 21 you see a what a book that's the book of life cuz the book has been consumed how will Sayan be destroyed by the brightness of this coming not his and and the Bible says his coming but who is he she is he that's this right here and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey as soon as I eat it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many people and Nations and tongues and Kings Revelations 1-6 you have a scene of Christ coming down to reveal something that has never been revealed on the face of the Earth and then God says hold it John don't WR there so John knew from there it was not going to be revealed right then so he said but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound that mystery will be finished then he picks right back up in verse eight and you see Bride you see Christ John and Christ on the scene and what does John do when he takes that book he eats it the book disappears until Revelations 20 and who judges the Earth that book and you judges the Earth okay Lord bless you come back we'll try to be here we're actually go to ministers meeting brother darl Hugh and we're going to stay over I think and go church over there thank you I think I need one down here behind you
