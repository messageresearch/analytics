[0:02] God bless you Saints it's good to be in
[0:05] the house of the
[0:06] Lord you love going to church this
[0:09] morning come
[0:14] expecting we're going through Hebrews 8
[0:17] let's just go to the Lord in prayer
[0:18] before we get into our study Lord we're
[0:20] so grateful to be able to gather
[0:21] together this morning Lord and we just
[0:22] ask Lord that you'll feel our F our
[0:25] bowls full today Lord and we just Lord
[0:27] as we meditate upon your scriptures Lord
[0:29] we come Lord we need hearts and we just
[0:30] ask Lord that you'll give us what we
[0:32] have need of granted Lord that as we
[0:34] unpack these words the the words of Paul
[0:37] Lord as we're studying these things out
[0:38] Lord that you'll help us to understand
[0:40] in your name
[0:43] amen so Paul was saying uh after in you
[0:46] know Hebrews chapter 7 he was laying out
[0:48] who melkisedek was and and uh and
[0:52] talking about those things and so he
[0:53] begins in Hebrews chapter 8 as as we
[0:56] kind of looked at a little bit last last
[0:58] Sunday he says now now of the things
[1:00] which we have SP spoken this is the son
[1:03] we have such an high priest who is set
[1:05] on the right hand of the Throne of the
[1:06] Majesty in the heavens a minister of the
[1:09] sanctuary and of the true Tabernacle
[1:11] which the Lord pitched and not man and
[1:14] in Hebrews 9 just to can compare with
[1:17] that scripture he said for Christ has
[1:19] not entered into the holy places made
[1:21] with hands which are the figures of the
[1:23] truth but into heaven itself now to
[1:26] appear in the presence of God for us and
[1:29] you think about after Christ died on the
[1:30] cross that he was able to go to go past
[1:33] the veil of his flesh into heaven to
[1:35] present the this the atonement that he
[1:37] had made to to say it the everything
[1:40] that everything that was typed on Earth
[1:42] in the Old Testament now has been
[1:44] accomplished when the high priest in the
[1:46] Old Testament would go once a year to
[1:48] sprinkle the blood on the on the uh The
[1:51] Mercy Seat all of those things were
[1:53] signifying that something was going to
[1:55] come the true atonement that would be
[1:57] once for all that our our our spirit
[1:59] spiritual high priest melkisedek God
[2:02] come down in flesh would come once for
[2:04] all to pay the price and so he entered
[2:06] in enter entered into heaven itself to
[2:09] prove that the price was paid so if we
[2:12] if we kind of examine that and and I
[2:14] apologize I'm trying to get better about
[2:16] my small font but U so I know this was a
[2:19] lot crammed in but just just listen on
[2:22] this slide and then we'll some of the
[2:23] other slid uh Lord willing will be a
[2:26] better a better size
[2:28] font
[2:31] uh so his his blood you think about what
[2:33] his blood did for us his blood that that
[2:35] he entered into heaven itself to prove
[2:37] that the price was paid for us his blood
[2:39] was the entrance fee to Heaven his blood
[2:40] paid the price for us to go to heaven
[2:43] his blood was the cleansing agent it
[2:44] clean cleaned us out so that so that uh
[2:47] the uh you think we were um on the way
[2:51] to church this morning uh sometimes my
[2:53] wife will read a scripture and and she
[2:55] was just reading through the book of
[2:56] Acts about all the things that Paul had
[2:58] done and you think about a man like that
[3:00] that had actually gone into people's
[3:01] houses and Drug them out grabbed them by
[3:04] their coat and Drug them to be and and
[3:06] and and and said I want these people to
[3:08] be killed but yet the blood of Jesus
[3:11] Christ was sufficient to clean all of
[3:13] that you so the blood his blood was the
[3:15] cleaning agent to clean all of our past
[3:18] up uh our past off his blood sealed and
[3:22] ratified the New Covenant what's the New
[3:24] Covenant that the Life of Christ would
[3:26] pay for our sins so that his life could
[3:28] come and dwell in the new in The
[3:29] Believer heart his blood took care of
[3:31] the sin ISS you once for all and that's
[3:34] in Hebrews 10 and and uh all these
[3:37] different verses in Hebrews 10 his blood
[3:39] brought bought us Eternal Redemption it
[3:42] was the exchange that took our sin and
[3:44] bestowed on us his righteousness his
[3:46] blood made peace with God and that's
[3:48] really what the the point Paul's trying
[3:50] to make that he's the mediator of this
[3:52] New Covenant the me what is a mediator
[3:54] somebody that's that's that's to to to
[3:56] bridge the gap and to also say that all
[3:59] all these things that have been promised
[4:01] are going to be fulfilled so Christ came
[4:04] to say to to say that all these things
[4:06] that are written about in the Old
[4:08] Testament are going to be fulfilled in
[4:10] in in Christ and in the life of the the
[4:13] believer his blood made peace with God
[4:16] his blood undid everything that sin and
[4:18] death ever took ruined or stained his
[4:21] blood gives us confidence to approach
[4:23] God boldly by faith if you have if you
[4:25] if you recognize by faith what God did
[4:28] for you then you it gives you confidence
[4:29] us to come to him boldly for whatever
[4:31] your petition is whatever his word says
[4:34] that you have access to his his blood
[4:36] paid the price for
[4:38] that so Paul goes on to say then verse
[4:40] three he said for every high priest is
[4:42] ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices
[4:45] wherefor it is of necessity that this
[4:47] man have somewhat also to offer for if
[4:50] he were on Earth he should not be a
[4:51] priest seeing that there are priests
[4:53] that offer gifts according to the law
[4:54] who serve unto the example and Shadow of
[4:57] heavenly things as Moses was a
[4:59] admonished of God when he was about to
[5:01] make the Tabernacle foree saith he that
[5:03] thou make all things according to the
[5:05] pattern showed to thee in the mount so
[5:07] what what gift did this man give he gave
[5:09] his blood he gave his life he gives his
[5:11] life in you and the gift of the Holy
[5:13] Ghost that's the gift that this man
[5:16] gifts but an Earthly priest would would
[5:19] have gifts of things to to offer but
[5:21] this man had his blood to offer in verse
[5:25] six he said but now hath he obtained a
[5:26] more excellent Ministry by how much also
[5:28] he is the mediator of a better Covenant
[5:31] which was established upon better
[5:33] promises for if that first Covenant had
[5:35] been faultless then that then should no
[5:37] place have been sought for the second
[5:39] for finding fault with them he saith
[5:41] behold the days come sayith the Lord
[5:43] when I will make a New Covenant with the
[5:45] house of Israel and with the house of
[5:47] Judah and we've kind of been examining
[5:49] with that New Covenant that that God's
[5:51] life that he would give his life for us
[5:53] that his life could be could be could
[5:55] live in The Believer the rest of the the
[5:57] rest of of of chapter he's actually
[6:00] quoting Jeremiah and we kind of read
[6:02] that last last Sunday he said for
[6:04] finding fault with them he saith behold
[6:06] the days come sayith the Lord will I
[6:08] will I will make a New Covenant with the
[6:10] house of Israel and with the house of
[6:12] Judah not according to the Covenant that
[6:14] I made with their fathers in the day
[6:16] when I took them by the hand to lead
[6:17] them out of the land of Egypt because
[6:19] they continued not in my Covenant and I
[6:21] regarded them not sayith the Lord for
[6:23] this is the Covenant that I will make
[6:24] with the house of Israel after those
[6:26] days say the Lord I will put my laws
[6:29] into their mind and write them in their
[6:31] hearts and I will be to them a God and
[6:33] they shall be to me a people you know
[6:36] that's kind of something I kind of
[6:37] wanted to sit on for a little bit in
[6:39] this in this lesson because we think you
[6:42] know Christ Christ paid the price for us
[6:46] and he made a way for us but the way the
[6:49] the way that he made is for us to be
[6:50] changed there's going to be an effect in
[6:53] our lives if you if you believe on the
[6:55] Lord Jesus Christ he he died to put all
[6:57] of those Old Testament laws to put the
[6:59] effect the essence of those laws Into
[7:01] the Heart of the believer so that they
[7:03] could be lived out so he said Jeremiah
[7:06] he's quoting Jeremiah and they shall not
[7:08] teach every man his neighbor and every
[7:09] man his brother saying know the Lord For
[7:11] All Shall know me from the least to the
[7:13] greatest for I will be merciful to their
[7:15] unrighteousness and their sins and
[7:17] iniquities will I remember no
[7:20] more so what Christ did what when he
[7:23] died on the cross was he fulfilled the
[7:24] law you what fulfill fulfill means is is
[7:28] if if we could just think about that
[7:30] there's a lot of things that were
[7:32] prophesied and spoken of in the Old
[7:33] Testament that are fulfilled in a lot of
[7:35] different ways there's there's there's
[7:37] things in the Old Testament that um
[7:40] we're we're looking forward to the day
[7:41] that we're living in like Ezekiel 36
[7:44] that I'll give you I'll soften up your
[7:46] heart and and give you a new spirit and
[7:48] and and then give you my spirit those
[7:50] that's looking to our day there's things
[7:52] that that were speaking of Jesus that
[7:55] that a virgin shall conceive and how he
[7:57] was going to come and where he would be
[7:59] born in Bethlehem and those kind of
[8:00] things that the atonement will be made
[8:03] so Christ he fulfilled he fulfilled that
[8:06] that there was an atonement going to be
[8:08] made but yet there's there's part of
[8:10] that there's there's things left for you
[8:12] and I to fulfill as well that's why we
[8:15] were we were speaking on as you see the
[8:18] revelation of Jesus Christ unfold you
[8:19] can't help but see the Revelation you're
[8:22] part of that Revelation unfold as well
[8:24] because if you're part of him you got
[8:26] you've got something to do as well
[8:29] that's what you know really what the new
[8:30] test the Old and New Testament is the
[8:32] Old Testament taking that that law the
[8:34] law written on stones and the New
[8:36] Testament put it in the believer's heart
[8:39] so what what it looks like is if you
[8:41] really under get the true understanding
[8:42] of the Old Testament the Old Testament
[8:44] was fulfilled in Jesus Christ and the
[8:46] New Testament is fulfilled in his bride
[8:49] so now you got a picture of the Old
[8:50] Testament is is the groom and the New
[8:53] Testament is the bride and you've got
[8:55] that now you got a picture a love story
[8:57] coming together so so so what uh you
[8:59] know what we were kind of getting in
[9:01] last last time about how the the the law
[9:04] the really to really fulfill the law
[9:06] it's it's fulfilled in love well you got
[9:09] a love story that's being unfolded here
[9:12] you got a love story where Christ died
[9:13] on the cross so that his bride so that
[9:16] he could be married to his bride so that
[9:18] he could call his bride to
[9:20] himself two two two Wings two wings that
[9:23] are are kind of spread out but but
[9:25] really it's a picture of a of a bride
[9:27] and a a a bride and his and his groom so
[9:31] you think about what the law the Law's
[9:33] got to be fulfilled everything's got to
[9:34] be fulfilled and so now let's take a
[9:36] little quick detour let's go on a rabbit
[9:38] Trail like we did last Sunday and talk
[9:40] about Jesus fulfilled the law but now
[9:42] the bride's going to fulfill the law too
[9:44] how she's going to how's she going to
[9:45] fulfill the law by becoming what the
[9:47] essence of what God wanted us to be how
[9:49] to love your neighbor and to forgive
[9:51] others and to to to be able to love
[9:53] people the way that God wanted them love
[9:54] somebody that that hates you so uh and
[9:58] when Jesus Jesus was preaching The
[9:59] Sermon on the Mount he said let your
[10:01] light so shine before men that they may
[10:03] see your good works and glorify your
[10:05] father which is in heaven think not that
[10:07] I am come to destroy the law or the
[10:09] prophets I am not come to destroy but to
[10:12] fulfill he he's not coming to just scrap
[10:14] it to do away with it but to actually
[10:17] manifest what the law was speaking of
[10:19] for verily I say unto you till Heaven
[10:21] and Earth pass one jot or one tit shall
[10:23] in no wise pass from the law till all be
[10:27] fulfilled so the whole body of textt has
[10:30] to be fulfilled in somebody somebody's
[10:32] going to live it now Jesus Christ was
[10:34] the living when he when he opened up the
[10:36] scroll and read there in Isaiah and
[10:38] identified himself with the scripture he
[10:40] was the living manifestation of what he
[10:42] was reading there so when you read in
[10:44] the Bible and you're you you also are
[10:46] the living manifestation of the words
[10:48] that you're reading on the page come off
[10:50] the page into a living reality so it's
[10:52] all got to be fulfilled and you're
[10:54] fulfilling it as well to fulfill means
[10:57] if you look in strong concordance it
[10:58] says says to cause God's will as made
[11:01] known in the law to be obeyed as it
[11:03] should be now see in the Old Testament
[11:06] they couldn't they couldn't live out the
[11:08] law they I mean they tried to but but
[11:11] the difference is when you got God
[11:12] inside of you God actually living it out
[11:16] in the essence of what the law means it
[11:19] can can be fulfilled and the way it
[11:21] should be that's that's the what it
[11:23] means to fulfill in the Oxford languages
[11:25] it says to bring to completion a reality
[11:28] to achieve or realize something desired
[11:31] promised or
[11:32] predicted you see I there's this idea
[11:35] that uh called antinomial ISM that that
[11:38] Martin Luther that's a big word but
[11:40] Martin Luther and John Wesley and all
[11:41] them fought against this idea that when
[11:44] Christ died on the cross that we don't
[11:46] have to live out like the Ten
[11:48] Commandments that there's this idea that
[11:49] people down Through the Ages have have
[11:52] have kind of they they they've thought
[11:54] that well when I since I'm a Christian I
[11:57] don't have to live according to into the
[11:59] law anymore I don't have to I can just
[12:01] throw away Thou shalt not kill Thou
[12:03] shalt not steal I I have a right maybe
[12:06] to do things in secret but the blood of
[12:08] Jesus Christ just covers it over but you
[12:10] see you don't have to do anything to
[12:12] come to Christ but when you do come to
[12:14] Christ that law will take effect in your
[12:17] members and it will begin to change your
[12:18] thinking and change your doing and
[12:20] change change the way that you work so
[12:22] that you you won't steal and you won't
[12:24] you won't uh do those
[12:26] things there's going to be an effect
[12:29] of of coming to Christ that's why Romans
[12:32] says for what the law could not do and
[12:35] that it was weak through the flesh God
[12:37] sending his own son in the likeness of
[12:38] sinful flesh and for sin condemns sin in
[12:41] the flesh that the righteousness of the
[12:43] law might be fulfilled in us who walk
[12:46] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[12:50] that's what the Holy Ghost was sent for
[12:52] to fulfill the law in you for they that
[12:54] are after The Flesh do mind the things
[12:56] of the flesh but they that are after the
[12:58] Spirit the things of the spirit for to
[13:01] be carnally minded is death but to be
[13:03] spiritually minded is life and peace
[13:06] because the carnal mind is enmity
[13:08] against God for it is not subject to the
[13:10] law of God Oh you mean we got to be
[13:12] subject to the law of God neither indeed
[13:15] can be so then they that are in the
[13:17] flesh cannot please God but ye are not
[13:20] in the flesh but in the spirit if so be
[13:23] that the spirit of God dwell in you now
[13:26] if any man have not the spirit of Christ
[13:28] he is none of his now you think about
[13:31] being subject to the law of God but if
[13:32] you go back and read what what the law
[13:35] the this is the this just a sample of
[13:37] the 16
[13:39] 613 uh laws that that are in the mitah
[13:42] that the I'm probably not pronouncing
[13:44] that right but to know there is a
[13:47] God to have no other gods to know that
[13:51] God is one to love
[13:56] God to fear God and these are all the
[13:59] thing all the things that are in The
[14:01] Loft they just they just scroll up not
[14:03] not to profane his
[14:05] name see you when you're baptized with
[14:08] the Holy Ghost and this becomes real
[14:10] that you can really do these things to
[14:13] listen well it stop scrolling on
[14:16] me to listen to the true
[14:22] Prophet well we'll just keep
[14:25] going but see I was just trying to
[14:27] highlight and example that that that God
[14:30] he wrote all these things down and that
[14:33] the New Testament the essence of those
[14:35] things in the Old Testament are being
[14:36] fulfilled in us he said in Paul said in
[14:40] in in in verse 13 He said in that he
[14:42] saith a New Covenant he hath made the
[14:44] first old now that now that which
[14:46] decayeth and waxeth old is ready to
[14:48] vanish away so Paul said in second
[14:51] Corinthians who also hath made us able
[14:54] Ministers of the New Testament not of
[14:56] the letter not like the the letter of
[14:59] the things that we read all these things
[15:00] that we have to adhere to like washing
[15:02] pots and things but of the spirit the
[15:05] essence of the things that are in the
[15:06] Old Testament the letter kth but the
[15:08] spirit giveth life but of the
[15:11] ministration of death written and
[15:13] engraven in Stones was glorious so that
[15:15] the children of Israel could not
[15:17] steadfastly behold the face of Moses for
[15:19] the glory of his countenance which Glory
[15:21] was to be done away how shall not the
[15:23] ministration of the spirit be rather
[15:26] glorious all of those things that were
[15:28] typed in the old test are now being
[15:30] fulfilled in Us by the Holy Ghost so
[15:34] Christ sacrific made every requirement
[15:35] of the law but the Life of Christ and
[15:38] the believer will be a living
[15:39] manifestation of the essence of the
[15:43] law and Mark 12 Jesus said the first of
[15:46] all the Commandments is here o Israel
[15:48] the Lord Our God as one Lord and the
[15:51] second is like this namely Thou shalt
[15:53] love thy neighbor as thyself there is
[15:55] none other commandment greater than
[15:57] these
[15:59] in Romans chapter 13 He said ohe no man
[16:01] anything but to love one another for he
[16:03] that loveth another hath fulfilled the
[16:06] law now you think that if true love is
[16:08] Manifest in the life of a Believer then
[16:10] the whole law is is can be summed up in
[16:13] the Fulfillment of that for this Thou
[16:15] shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not
[16:17] kill Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not
[16:19] bear false witness Thou shalt not covet
[16:22] and if there be any other commandment it
[16:23] is briefly comprehended in this saying
[16:25] namely Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[16:27] thyself love worketh no ill to his
[16:30] neighbor therefore love is the
[16:32] fulfilling of the law that's a weighty
[16:36] statement at it that love fulfills the
[16:39] whole
[16:40] law in Galatians chapter 5 he said for
[16:43] Brethren you have been call into Liberty
[16:45] only use not Liberty for an occasion to
[16:47] the flesh but by love serve one another
[16:50] for all the law is fulfilled in one word
[16:53] even in this Thou shalt love thy
[16:55] neighbor as thyself and in James chapter
[16:58] two if you fulfill the Royal law
[17:00] according to the scripture Thou shalt
[17:02] love thy neighbor as thyself you do well
[17:06] you see we're living in an age though
[17:08] where love has been redefined into
[17:10] something that doesn't match what the
[17:11] scripture is we think we use we use when
[17:14] you start talking about love we use it
[17:15] as an occasion to say well I'm not being
[17:17] treated right but if we'll take what the
[17:19] Bible says and examine ourselves and try
[17:21] to match up with that then we can really
[17:24] we'll really see what the essence of
[17:26] What Love Is Love Is Love is to not put
[17:28] yourself above somebody else to always
[17:31] be looking for the other person's
[17:32] benefit to try to reach out to try to be
[17:35] to try to be uh to be inclined to see
[17:38] the other person come to
[17:40] Salvation cuz that's that's where our
[17:43] goal is to to give others eternal life
[17:46] you and and this age that we're living
[17:47] in has Twisted love around to where you
[17:49] know even even children they they don't
[17:51] When Love is being shown to your
[17:52] children you know sometimes they'll say
[17:53] well you don't love me but love is the
[17:56] definition of what love is has been
[17:58] twisted it around so that when you try
[17:59] to show love it's well you don't really
[18:01] love me but love love love is love is
[18:04] like uh where the Bible talked about the
[18:06] prophets would rise up early in the
[18:07] morning and and and try to tell people
[18:10] the truth and rebuke rebuke with
[18:12] longsuffering cuz love love wants the
[18:15] best for you love I I maybe maybe just
[18:20] meditate on these things as we as we go
[18:22] through these scriptures and think about
[18:23] what love is hereby we perceive the love
[18:26] of God because he laid down his life for
[18:28] us and we ought to lay down our lives
[18:29] for the Brethren but when he when he
[18:31] died on the cross for for all the the
[18:33] Israelites and back then they they
[18:35] didn't recognize his love that he was
[18:37] showing to
[18:38] him who soath this world's good and
[18:41] seeth his brother have need and shth up
[18:42] his bowels of compassion from him how
[18:44] dwelleth the love of God in him my
[18:46] little children let us not love in word
[18:48] neither in tongue but in deed in
[18:51] truth and in 1 John chapter 5 he said
[18:54] whosoever believeth that Jesus is the
[18:55] Christ is born of God and everyone that
[18:58] loveth him that begat loveth him also
[19:01] that is begotten of him by this we know
[19:04] that the love of children of God that we
[19:06] love the children of God when we love
[19:08] God and keep his Commandments for this
[19:10] is the love of God that we keep his
[19:12] Commandments and his Commandments are
[19:14] not Grievous so there's there's how you
[19:16] know if you love God if you love his
[19:17] word if you love God you'll keep his
[19:19] Commandments because if you love God
[19:21] then that then you're if the love of
[19:23] Christ is in you then you will have a
[19:25] desire to fulfill the law to ful feel
[19:28] the essence of God's word to walk in his
[19:32] word
[19:34] yes so what some examples of love in the
[19:38] Bible in 1 Corinthians chapter 10 Paul
[19:41] said let no man seek his own but every
[19:43] man another's wealth
[19:46] everybody when you want to seek seek the
[19:49] the the benefit of others instead of
[19:51] your own Hebrews chapter 13 says be not
[19:54] forgetful to entertain strangers for
[19:56] thereby some of entertained angels
[19:58] unaware so so there love is being
[20:00] expressed in
[20:02] Hospitality why cuz you're trying to get
[20:04] people to Christ remember them that are
[20:06] in bonds as bound with them that's why
[20:09] we have the prayer request every morning
[20:10] because we're remembering those that are
[20:12] that that are in you know have
[20:14] infirmities and and uh in in bonds of
[20:18] their mind and suffering because the
[20:21] devil's got them in prison in a prison
[20:23] house and them which suffer adversity is
[20:25] being yourselves also in the body Mar
[20:28] marage is Honorable and all and the bed
[20:29] undefiled but whoremongers and
[20:31] adulterers God will judge let your
[20:33] conversation be without covetousness and
[20:36] be
[20:37] content with such things as you have
[20:40] love love is just being content and not
[20:42] comparing yourselves with others and I I
[20:45] you know I like to quote that that
[20:47] saying that comparison is the thief of
[20:49] Joy because when you start when you're
[20:50] not content and you start comparing
[20:52] yourself with other than others and ask
[20:54] the devil to take your joy away but just
[20:57] just just be happy with what you got
[21:00] Philippians chapter 2 says let nothing
[21:02] be done through Strife or vain Glory but
[21:05] in loneliness of Mind Let each esteem
[21:07] other better than themselves look not
[21:10] every man on his own things but every
[21:13] man also on the things of others because
[21:15] we want to help one another right help
[21:18] one another to to to grow up this
[21:21] stature of a perfect man so Lo Romans
[21:24] Romans 13 said that love is the
[21:26] fulfilling of the law brother said in
[21:28] the brass serpent he said God has a law
[21:30] and that law is love then if I love God
[21:34] correctly that I'm going to testify the
[21:37] truth about God if I'm in love with him
[21:40] I've got a wife's here in this building
[21:43] now see what what what's this got to do
[21:45] with Hebrews because I was as I talked
[21:47] about in the beginning the Old Testament
[21:49] is the groom and the New Testament is
[21:51] the wife so it's really a love story so
[21:54] if you love God in the right way God God
[21:56] doesn't have like he's he's trying to
[21:58] make this paint this picture of you
[21:59] don't have to his his his wife didn't
[22:02] have to tell him you better not you know
[22:04] sleep around with some women when you're
[22:06] overseas you better not do all this kind
[22:08] of stuff when when it's a picture of
[22:10] love then that everything works in
[22:12] Harmony when you really love one another
[22:14] then you don't have to worry brother
[22:16] Brown said I've got a wife's here in
[22:17] this building God knows how I love her
[22:20] well you know everything good and
[22:22] everything good and everything is going
[22:23] to be for my wife you know that you're
[22:25] just like your husband would be to you
[22:26] now well now if we love love God then my
[22:30] confidence becomes perfect in him as I
[22:34] love him so if you love God and you know
[22:37] that he loves you because you because
[22:40] you can see in his word all these
[22:42] promises that are laying there waiting
[22:43] to be fulfilled then you can have
[22:45] confidence to come boldly to his throne
[22:48] knowing that we've got a high priest and
[22:50] all these promises that Paul laid out
[22:52] for us because we're in love with him
[22:54] and that gives us confidence that he's
[22:56] going to be there for you what whatever
[22:58] whatever life throws at you whatever the
[23:00] devil throws at you because it's love
[23:03] love is what gives confidence now he
[23:06] can't break that law of Love seed
[23:08] because it's in my heart so now that
[23:09] means that even when you fall and make
[23:11] mistakes you got a love relationship you
[23:14] you're in love with God and you know he
[23:16] loves you you have confidence that he'll
[23:19] forgive you of your
[23:21] sins so Paul goes on in verse in verse
[23:24] one of of chapter n he said ver then
[23:26] verily the first Covenant also
[23:28] ordinances of divine service and a
[23:30] worldly Sanctuary for there was a
[23:32] tabernacle made the first wherein was
[23:34] the Candlestick and the table and the
[23:36] showbread which is called the
[23:38] sanctuary and after the second Veil The
[23:41] Tabernacle which is called the holiest
[23:43] of all which had the golden sensor and
[23:45] the Heart of the Covenant Ark of the
[23:46] Covenant overlaid roundabout with gold
[23:48] wherein was the golden pot that had mana
[23:50] and Aaron's Rod that budded and the
[23:52] tables of the Covenant and over at the
[23:54] cherums of Glory shadowing The Mercy
[23:56] Seat of which we cannot now speak
[23:58] particularly he's talking about all
[24:00] these things were shadow of the reality
[24:03] that we have access to now that is being
[24:05] fulfilled in our lives all of these
[24:07] things the golden sensor and the pot of
[24:09] mana and Aaron's Rod that bded were
[24:11] symbols of Christ Living in us to
[24:14] fulfill his
[24:16] word cuz in verse 8 he said the Holy
[24:19] Ghost does signify that the way into the
[24:21] all those things represented the holy
[24:23] ghost that the way into the holy holiest
[24:27] was not yet made manifest well while as
[24:29] the first Tabernacle was yet standing
[24:32] which was a figure for the time then
[24:34] present in which were offered both gifts
[24:35] and sacrifices that could not make him
[24:38] that did the service perfect as
[24:40] pertaining to the
[24:41] conscience but Christ being comeing high
[24:44] priest of good things to come by a
[24:46] greater and more perfect Tabernacle not
[24:49] made with hands that is to say not of
[24:51] this building neither by the blood of
[24:53] goats and calves but by his own blood he
[24:56] entered in once into the the holy Place
[24:59] having obtained Eternal Redemption for
[25:01] us it's his blood that paid the price
[25:04] yes for if the blood of bulls and goats
[25:08] and the ashes of an hepher sprinkling
[25:09] the unclean sanctify to the purifying of
[25:12] the of the flesh how much more shall the
[25:14] blood of Christ who Purge who who
[25:17] through the eternal spirit offered
[25:19] himself without spot to God Purge your
[25:21] conscience from dead Works to serve the
[25:25] Living
[25:26] God
[25:28] to serve the Living God he wanted he
[25:30] wants to change us from you know what
[25:33] dead Works dead works is looking at
[25:34] those Old Testament rules Old Testament
[25:38] laws is like rules and regulations you
[25:40] have to follow without your heart being
[25:42] changed something that you look at and
[25:44] say well if I can just act this out and
[25:47] and just be a good pheral actor then you
[25:49] met the requirements and we we'll we'll
[25:52] we'll close on this in Mark chapter 7 he
[25:55] said he answered and said unto them well
[25:58] well hath Isaiah prophesied of you
[26:00] Hypocrites is as it is written this
[26:03] people honor me with their lips but
[26:04] their heart is far from me how be it in
[26:07] vain do they worship me they were
[26:09] worshiping according to what they
[26:10] thought the law required by you know
[26:12] doing things just with an outwardly
[26:14] appearance and washing pots and yeah he
[26:17] said teaching for doctrines the
[26:18] Commandments of men for laying aside the
[26:20] Commandment of God you hold the
[26:22] tradition of men as the washing of pots
[26:24] and cups and many other such things like
[26:26] you do and he said unto them full well
[26:28] you reject the Commandment of God that
[26:30] you may keep your own
[26:32] tradition and in Matthew chap 23 as a
[26:35] musicians come forward he said woe unto
[26:37] you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for
[26:40] you make clean the outside of the cup
[26:42] and of the platter but within they are
[26:44] full of extortion and excess Thou blind
[26:47] Pharisee cleanse first that which is
[26:49] within the C cup and platter that the
[26:52] outside of them may be clean also God
[26:54] wants to change our conscience our
[26:56] thinking from dead Works to a living
[26:59] reality filled by the Holy Ghost
[27:01] quickened so that the law is actually
[27:03] made manifest in our members and how is
[27:06] it made manifest through love because
[27:08] love is the fulfilling of the law when
[27:10] you love God through the baptism of the
[27:12] Holy Ghost and you love one another
[27:14] you're actually fulfilling all the old
[27:16] things that were prophesied in the New
[27:18] Testament and you become a living
[27:20] walking Testament of those things that
[27:22] they could only probe at we'll stop
[27:25] there God bless
[27:26] you
[27:30] [Applause]
[27:38] than
