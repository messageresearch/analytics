========================================

all right right see if this we are live good morning everybody good morning we're going to keep speaking on the subject of communion which is what we've been talking on for quite a while wonderful and communion is is fellowship with God moving up the statue of a perfect man moving in Union with him until we're speaking the same language where we understand what uh our purpose is and who God is and what we're doing here and when the process is completed and we'll take a body change amen so while we're down in Mobile I just kind of last night I was trying to put some notes together and I threw some things together and based on just you know just here the brothers preach and everything and and I got to thinking on on this scripture blessed is the man from Jeremiah 1778 blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord and whose hope the Lord is for he shall be as a tree planted By the Waters and that spread out her Roots by the river and shall not see when he cometh but her leaves shall be green and shall not be careful in the year of drought neither shall cease from yelding FR you know we a lot of us have been in the message a long time and and years ago it seemed like everything was was very mysterious and um long and long everything begins to make more sense amen that's what I've been that's what I've been kind of getting at until as we keep growing and growing and our Our Roots dig down deep into the word of God then then we get to the point where we're not like like in First Peter chapter 2 where uh Peter was talking about don't be like newborn babies anymore right but grow up so that you're not swayed by every wind of Doctrine every little thing that comes along where you're you're wondering is this right is that right and I I was listening to I was reading a sermon the other day I was trying to find that quote this morning and I couldn't find it but um brother V was talking about how when he's preaching he can get these these little he he discerns what people are doubt from different people and he said they'll be from this direction somebody saying but what about and from over here somebody will say but what about so as we draw into Union with Christ all of those little what abouts are blasted Away by the revealed word of God that's till we don't have any more whatabouts anymore amen and that's what that's how we'll take a body change yes sir because there won't be no more whatabouts exactly Enoch just walked right on He Walked on up and walked with God was right in commun with God am and he took a walk to glory and his body was changed amen so as you draw into communion you you you're your roots are are just going down into the Wellsprings of everlasting life you're planted by like like a tree planted By the Waters and look how he changes the tents now look what he's talking about he shall be planted he shall be as a tree and then he changes the tense he changes the the the the gender that spread without her Roots by the river and shall not see when he cometh all around things are going to gross darkness in the land but it it doesn't bother bother somebody that's that's rooted in the word amen that's right shall not see when he cometh but her leaves shall be green and shall not be careful in the year of drought neither shall there there's coming a famine in the land a family for the hearing of the word but to a real believer that's that's been feasting like that song we sang Feast on the body word of God Amen eat from the body word of God Amen cuz that's how we'll take a body change do you want a body change from the body word that's right and neither shall cease from yielding fruit and the believer's fruit is the doctrine that we've heard right quickened by the spirit made alive in us so that it's not written on the page anymore that's right now it's written in the life of the believer amen cuz we're building up and if you look through all the scriptures one of the words that means building is this new testament word edifying and you know you kind of think of edifying as a as a as a the minister saying things to edify the Believers but one of the things I've been one of the points I've been trying to get across is that this the spirit of God communion is not just for a Ministry but every member of the body of Christ is supposed to be being built up that's right and now now when we have conversation one with another our conversation should be edifying cuz you know brother brand said every believer is an optimist every believer is is if if if the word of God is living inside a Believer our conversation should conform to what's written on the pages when we talk to one another we should we should edify we shouldn't say well you know what about about it should be rooted in God's word I believe that God God will heal you amen I believe that you know whatever you have needful of let our conversation be edifying because this is what Paul's getting the cross Romans 14:1 17-19 for the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost for he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God and approved of men let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace and things where with one may edify another that's it amen cuz we're growing we're building right word on top of word amen and sometimes you know uh sisters and and and different ones in the church can save things to help me and oh my brother sure sure but we're all helping water we're all we're all growing you know uh uh because the least in the king like Jesus said the least in the kingdom is greater than John the Baptist the least in the kingdom is is can have can you can pull virtu right from the least in the Kingdom amen all things are lawful for me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but all things edify not yeah so we should be concerned about edifying and you remember brother Brandon this is this is maybe a strange little scripture for me remember brother Brand's explanation of this is if a sister comes and ask for advice or something goes into his into his study then it would be lawful according for for God you know from God's vantage point for him to go and and give her advice but for our Vantage Vantage Point we might look upon that and say well he shouldn't be going into that study something might be going on going wrong he's in there with a woman a sister alone it doesn't look right it's not edifying it doesn't it it you know things could be said things could be you know it looks strange so we should be we should be concerned about helping one another to grow that's right and when you do things like that that don't don't appear well then it it can cause somebody to stumble that's your knowledge yes cuz that's the deser to be able to discern what's going on cuz all things don't edify that's good but the discernment is what up the statue of perfect man that knowledge in there tells you what's edifying and what's not cuz some things you eat you kind of like some things you eat you don't like you eat them cuz you have to yeah first Thessalonians 5 8:14 but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and forign helment the hope of salvation for God has not appointed us to wrath but to obain Salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him because we're we're communion with God through through the word and communion with one another that's the only way that we can come into the unity of the faith is by his word right that's right communion with one another and real communion with one another edifies one another right wherefore Comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as also you do and we beseech you Brethren to know them which labor among you and are over you and the Lord and admonish you and to esteem them very highly in love for their work sake and be at peace among yourselves that's good now I I'm just kind of go through some of these quotes very quickly cuz I'm I I'm kind of going from that that tree that cannot be shaken through a few things and we'll come back Circle back around and end up at that tree because in this last in this day there's so many things that can shake a real believer there's so many things that that that this in this layout of see and age all the devils are turned against the bride to to attack and and the only thing that we can be fortified by behind is the word of God Amen right earnestly continuing for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints in 1953 this this brother was telling um trying to trying to get across this point that we don't need that the Pentecost anymore uh I said they're the ones that believe and he said well he said brother brand I think that Pentecost was a scaffold said that God was going to put up a building and he put made Pentecost a scaffold well I said that's right I'll agree with you he said well see after the scaffold work's done we don't need the scaffold anymore in other words the build is complete but God is still building right the scaffold work isn't done when the build is completed God will take it up so so we're still working on the building Foundation got to have foundation so now now pay real attention to what brother Dale's been preaching on on anointing because as you get up to the C Stone remember the difference between the bottom and the top is the bottom is a feeling the top is an anointing and the word that that anointing has got to come up p a word born bride somebody that's that's uh you know you well let's let me read some close let get ahead of myself Jesus keeps all his appointments in 1964 he said just like this when my shadow here of my hand if I never seen my my hand seen the shadow it's kind of it gets pale as it gets away but as it gets closer and closer the negative and positive are coming together until they both become the same thing what's he about he's talking about communion he's talking about how we're eating the body word of of God and we draw closer and closer to him until we become the same thing right amen and that's exactly when the church and the word has to be one like Jesus and God was one just exactly that's it God has was in it was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and so will Christ have to be in the church the anointed of the word to make everything fulfilled and that's the Capstone that comes upon the last Church age not the lay out of sea now out of that a bride out of a church church out of a church in other words just like he called a nation out of a nation in Egypt and now we're living in that day what a day amen and the choosing of a bride brother Brown said he's kind of explaining the difference between anointing and the birth you know the birth of the word we kind of explained that last time that the way you're born again is by two things coming together the way that spirit and Truth the way that we take a body change is that head coming and uniting with the body amen the anointing upon the ano upon the body word a Believer that's been that's been mature that's grown through Grace uh through through eating the word if you'd say you got the Holy Ghost and won't cope with the word it's another spirit in you uhoh now see there's the evidence of a real Holy Ghost filled believer a real Born Again Believers that they will line up or or their desire is to line up with the word and when it's presented to you you'll you'll follow right after that word you'll line to agree with every word not just nod your head not just say well here I am in church and because the pastor uh agrees with the word that I've got it or that somebody else agrees with it but you agree with the word if you have that anointing on you then you you think you're anointed by the the genuine Holy Spirit a genuine baptism but you won't follow the word you'll you'll think you're okay somebody will present to you that your your your addess is not right or or different things uh that's why in in churches or in denominational churches you got people smoking cigarettes in the parking lot and stuff because they're or or like remember that story that brother bam told of the of the um the the couple that the brothers that were one was speaking in tongues and one was interpreting and one uh was living with a woman that wasn't his wife and whatnot and no anointed by genuine baptism but not filled right with the word that'll make that word live inside of you make like a a tree that's bearing fruit cuz your fruit is your Doctrine made manifest and without that word quick and living inside of you that Doctrine cannot live it's just an anointing on on you if you'd say you've got the Holy Ghost and won't cope with the word it's another Spirit In You God's spirit is on his word the m in it the anointed word the bride must be a messiah it y the anointed word amen in Matthew 242 24:28 this this is a scripture that's all that's familiar to us that if any man shall say unto you Lo here is Christ or there believe it not Christ is over there at this church Christ is over here at this church or over at this place or or uh you know that that Peruan doctrine that that God came down in 1963 and is over here I want him in here right amen not over there somewhere and this is this scripture shows where he is for there shall arise false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect if it were possible now that goes back to that tree that I'm getting to once you grown up in Grace and knowledge you're not a newborn baby anymore shaken by the wind shaken by everything can you be deceived that's right once you once that calf Stone comes down and and you're you're a uh the image of Christ the image of a stature of perfect man behold I've told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret chamber believe it not for as the lightning cometh out of the East and shineth even un the the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be amen and we know uh in uh in Revelation chapter 7 uh that angel ascended from the East having the Seal of the Living God sealing all the 144,000 from the East to the west and brother Brown taught how that the word has traveled from the East to the West it's not in any particular place but it's in an individual communion with God where you enter in into fellowship with him for whatsoever see what he's talking about is where you going to find where you going to find Christ over there over here we'll find him where the word is wheresoever the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered together not old rotten carcass but a fresh carcass that the Eagles can Feast upon and these are all things that maybe are are common that's why you find out you see it says here is Christ so there believe it not the only way you're going to not believe it like you said is in here so that's why you see people go over here and they go over there and they're searching for this this this brother's got it or this brother's got it well you better have it first yes cuz if you don't have it if you got it first then you stay right where you're at because you'll go in the desert you'll go to a secret chamber you'll go looking for things but if he's inside you then you're not going to you're going to be a believer yeah cuz somebody's going to say unto you that's what them false Christ going to say I have him you got to come to me or he in brother brandom and he left and we're waiting for him to come back or he's in this one and we got to go over here that tree don't move that tree stays right where s right like that quote brother Brandon uh wanding Stars wondering but that tree don't move say works out y for as the lightning that lith out in Luke 1724 that lighten us out of the one part under Heaven shineth under the other part under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day that lith that makes Darkness light you read the scripture I don't understand that it's all dark but then the let the light of the word just like in the beginning he spoke and it was light and he Shone upon what was dark and exposed it God's revealing his word and that's that's where you'll find him and it's a personal a personal communion a personal experience and and Jo Jehovah is explain now his body can't do it when that comes time is over as the light lightning Cometh From The East unto the West so shall the coming of the son of man be but his Spirit by a revelation of of his word a personal experience with him now anointed one and and in this sermon anointed ones at the end time anointed one is one with a message and the only way the message can be brought out is by one that's anointed and that would be a prophet anointed there shall rise f false anointed teachers a prophet teaches what his message is Anointed teachers but anointed people with false teaching anointed ones Christ plural prophets plural now now think about that false Christ and false prophets and I just I started off by talking about how we're supposed to be edifying one another now what happens when when a minister like brother Dale gets up and and he lays out the word just as plain as anything and I'm going meddle a little bit and then you go home and and and the wife or the husband or whoever says well that's not right what about that that's then then what what what ends up happening you see we we we're all trying to be in communion with one another if you if all the ministers in this church are not uh ride in line then it it just causes confusion and then if the if the minister gets brother Dale brother Wade gets up and preaches and lays it out straight and then you go home and tell your kids well I'm not sure when they just laid it out straight in the Bible then it just it messes the whole thing up and there's some there's some strong things that I can say right there that I I will not pour your why not why not Bob you got time you can be you got plenty you can be you can hey I'm trying to have mercy and not sacrifice I have mercy and not sacrifice what you saying go ahead all right let's let's keep on going the anointed ones of the end now in every case you will notice that a false prophet is one who is outside the word y just as we showed you that Antichrist means anti- word so these false prophets come perverting the word giving it a meaning that fits their own devilish ends have you ever noticed how the people who lead others astray bind themselves closely bind themselves bind them closely to themselves by fear Now isn't that the same thing that we were reading coming down from Kush and nrod where they get that that hammer and try to come found the people with beating them and everything they say that if the people won't do what they say or if they leave then destruction will follow they are false prophets for a true Prophet communion here won't stand between you and God but tries to take you to Christ a true Prophet will always lead one to the word and bind the people to Jesus Christ that's right and he won't tell the people to fear Him or what he says but to fear what the word says boy you can say a lot about that don't be concerned about what other people think about you be concerned about the one that can destroy the soul don't don't fear what anybody else well brother so and so going get mad at me if I but fear fear God and try to line up with him right fear what the word says now now that's true communion that's what a true Prophet will do that's what a true Minister will do is bind you to God not to himself or anything like that notice how these people like Judas are out for money they get you to sell all you have and get up to them and their schemes they spend more time on offerings than the word that those who attempt to operate gifts will make use of a gift which has a margin of error in it that's a good quote I like that and then ask for money and neglect the word and call it of God you remember what brother Rand said about prophecy you better make sure that it's correct every time if you say you got a gift or anything I remember I forget who it was but uh there was a brother in his church that that had a little a little a gift of Prophecy or whatever but every around then it was a little bit off he said just lay it to the side cuz it's got to be 100% in line we don't want we don't want to fool around anything that's 99% right and people will go to them and bear with them and support now that's that's W people will go them that's the ones that you the scripture you read go to the desert go here cuz it's not in here if it was in there they'd see that yeah they just keep putting up cuz it's a way of death people will go to them and bear with them and support them and believe them not knowing it is the way of death yes yes did I just read that same question yep mhm I got in there twice that's all right now look what communion is in the Old Testament that they try they stand they try to get into that holy of holies standing outside looking in and trying to get in there and there was a veil and they never they could never see the the way they covered up the Ark of the Covenant I I was reading that all the process they went through they took the covering the batter skins and everything and laid it on the Ark of the Covenant and wrapped it up nobody ever saw it when they were carrying it and everything it was it was something hidden it was always veiled even when it was moving right and and you know they couldn't get inside in this into this little room the holy of holies and then one day Jesus died on the cross in that Veil that was as thick as a man's hand there was no way for that thing even naturally you couldn't cut it but supernaturally God RI just split that Veil into two so now you have access into that little room where you and God can come and have communion and he actually split it from top to bottom to make sure man you know a man can split it from the bottom to the top but no man can get up there on that thing and split it down yeah from the top to the bottom so it came from God all the way down to man instead of man going that way I like that picture cuz that's split it split from the top to bottom cut it split and the bottom still got it's still connected like it was split down when you split something like that it don't don't do real straight it goes all Jack oh yeah mm problem was problem was they sewed it back up that's the whole problem they seed the thing back up wasn't time yeah was of time so now look at the day of Pentecost they were in a little room up there on the Pentecost when they were all Gather in one place afraid coward sitting in behind the wall walled in a little room but and then all of a sudden there came a sound from heaven like of a little rushian Mighty Wind It fill all the house they were sitting in that little room and and this look at this vision brother brand had about the third pool like a fire whing around licking blazing it left me went right down over the top of that audience and went and stood over the top of that little building and then settle down on top of it and one place he describes it as a little room several places a little building and then when it did this one they was standing behind me behind me the same voice the Angel's voice he said I'll meet you in there and this is the third pool but nobody will know nothing about it well I don't understand why in there why there well there's the answer it w't be a public right I don't understand going in that closet like that well there's the answer and he said it's is it not written by our Lord when thou pray be not like the Hypocrites who like to be be heard before men but enter into the secret closet and pray to the father who seeth in secret and he who seeth in secret shall reward thee openly yes you have that secret communion with God and you're going to Bear forth fruit openly because you got to be written Epistles known and read of all men where the book can be get plainly exposed that's right and that's what that's what we're getting to communion right there yeah right question is the anointing that you're talking about the Holy Spirit on the pyramid yes okay U the Capstone Divine love so that well let me let me go ahead I'm going to get to that now see brother br talked about three pulls how that how that what what are the three pulls God drawing people in fellowship with him correct from justification sanctification baptism all but okay get in the new birth and then it keeps drawing you up into communion with him so that you're like a tree playing By the Waters that can't be moved that's right and when that head comes down when that Capstone comes down then you're in perfect communion and that's why the the seals had to be open so that so that we could take a body change so that that uh that that third pool had to come so that all the scriptures everything all the little whatabouts right could be done away with now look what happens with with Noah with his third pool he he preached then he went in the ark then the door was shut and he's in there for seven days and his testimony was here I am inside of the Ark it's true the word he was sealed inside and they were sealed out Witnesses to the people that were out he was sealed in the process had been completed he was inside the ark now what about Abraham those three the three men came to him and he wasn't deceiving he knew there wasn't there wasn't no Trinity or anything he called him my Lord not my Lord's and and and the first pull of course we know that lot was down there in in uh brother Brown called it Mercy lot was down there in Sodom and gomorah mercy to them and they turned it down and then sent two angels and they turned that down and then God himself now see what there's two PE two things going on while while God is revealing himself to the elect in Genesis Chapter 18 he's opening up the Mysteries to Abraham showing him all these secret things while at the same time judgment is is is striking gamar right I like that picture you see how young mzc is I like all the people that's Jesus at 20 years old that's SW came was a theophany right yes cuz you'd look at other pictures of mezc and he looks like Abraham old man God ain't never been old oldest God ever been was 33 in the human body but that's a good picture maybe maybe some of these will kind of stick in our minds and help us to remember yes now did you notice there was three pools of it three turns of it and another place he got three jumps when they went out first and call them or bid to come and they didn't do it so they went out a healing campaign went out to get the Blind and hard and I'm going to skip over man has always tried to make excuses not to receive God's word of his invitation let skip down now we see when God makes gives a man an invitation and to do something to receive the invitation that he's given him and he returns it down then there's nothing left after Mercy is bured but judgment if you step over the boundaries of Mercy then there's only one thing left and that is judgment and we find that man has done that in all ages it's happened most every age in the Bible God drawing us into communion with himself and if you turn that down after God has pulled out all stops with the prophets message had a man up there that could turn his back to the audience and and and reveal the word open the word and and call those those those rainbow trout that were deep down in that deep water that one of the deep things of the word right and Look Away to Jesus he said it's tightening and when that time comes and the Press comes to a place to where you're pressed then watch what I'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes watch the third pulled in see and it'll be absolutely to the total loss but it will be for the bride and the church that's right Elijah in the meal offering and now Jesus the son of God has com into this Remnant to pull the people for the Capstone to bring back the Son of God to to complete the thing for the coming of the Lord Jesus he said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man and souls that are prison now and oh this is a powerful message remember when we we first heard this way back in the day and my goodness it it it it like it put fear like Peter was talking about that we should live in fear to do the word of God that's right it's the word living there it is if they' have only looked he was Messiah he was the Living Word made manifest and a man that's got the spirit of God in him or a woman lives that word lives right out in them that's the heartbeat the predestinated for the word of the Lord comes to them and they are the word to the people written Epistles read of all men is that right could the third pool be on true cuz you know what what I'm getting at is the third pull is the opening of the word right first pull is the opening of the word second pull is the opening more the third pool is over all world Amen and and he says there the lamb come and and took the book out of the right hand of him and set down and claimed what he owned what he had redeemed that right it's always been that third pull through is perfection the ministry come to his Perfection when it reproduc Christ again in natural amongst human beings as was predicted as it was in the days of lot which is what we're trying to do communion reproduces Christ in Earth I'm running out of time three jumps is what brother R call it cuz God's drawing people by three pulls that brother brand got up there on the stage and he put his hand out and put put his hand on people's hand drawing people come and see all you that lab under heavy L and then he began to discern the things in people's hearts and and calling people now when you get in when that when that word that you've heard is quickened inside of you then he he keeps drawing you up that's right through the three pull your journey like brother Wade priest years ago and and keep just keep drawing you up into a personal walk a personal Journey the anointed word the first pool healing second pull prophesying third pull the opening of the world the Mysteries revealed no more there's no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word and remember the third pool is the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word it is then in that day when this thing is to take place that Janice and jam impersonators will appear again just like they did when Moses appeared with the original word to say it they appear to impersonate it just exactly right they appear to impersonate it y now you see what Matthew 24:24 is Anointed ones anointed ones that have that that baptism that the spirit on them but not in them to make them conform to the word to make it live inside of them and it it is so close that if were possible it would deceive the very election only the elected or predestinated mm will be able to detect that's right the difference between them let me read this whole I'm fixing to wrap it up here I just got about two more minutes here is the word Christ himself that's the anointed word which shall come for the rest of his body the bride the anointed of the same water that water the wheat as we talked about also Waters the Terrors anointed ones only the elected or predestinated will be able to detect the difference between them now I'll finish with this little story cuz I don't know if you've been following the news but there's this this this uh just crazy story about this fell in Russia or somewhere that he's got this horrible disease in his body so they going to they he's found this doctor is going to try this new thing where they're going to do the first ever head transplant they going to take his head off and put it on somebody else's body now look that's kind of that's kind of absurd but what we're talking about is God is building up from the feet to the neck and he's going to come down the head and have preeminence the head uniting with the body and and spiritual now and and then we can go in the Rapture and I'll end right there have a picture landed with science fiction yeah turn
