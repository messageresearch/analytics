see what I have to say this morning I said in Jesus name okay that's all right uh today I want to continue my talk on Vision dreams and dimensions so I might read a couple of more scriptures and quotes that I I think I can read and uh so then Donna did a good job last week and so did brother Tim cross yes you did a very good job so I thank the Lord for the thoughtful Ministry amen if we all want to get out of here we all have to do it our part so as small as I am and I'll try to do my part okay I think uh last time I didn't read this uh on the little paper here that uh I want you all guys so I'm gonna read that first let me say look at here friends let me give this illustration I'm not done it before what color is that shirt it's white anyone that's got sight knows that shirt's White you say you have five senses on the body seed taste feel smell here now these will declare God when God made man he made him in his image instead of man's and he put him in a five sense to con contact his Earthly home not to contact god with those senses don't declare God they declare the Earthly home when a man had to contact his Earthly home he had to see tasteful smell here you say my faith is the stuff substance of thanks hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen you did not see it taste it feel it smell it or hear it but you believe it that's from the message faith that works is dead there's a couple of scriptures that I missed last time so let's go to numbers 24 1. numbers 24 1 and when Baylen saw that he pleased the lord to bless Israel who went not as other times to seek for enchantment but he set his face toward the wilderness and balen lifted up his eyes and saw Israel abide in his tents according to their tribes and the spirit of God Came Upon him and he took up his Parable and said Bala and Asana there that said and the man whose eyes opened had said he had said we heard the words of God we saw the vision of the almighty and fallen and into a trance but Heaven his eyes opened last time I kind of went a little fast and did a lot of quotes so if anybody has any comments or something just the brother Donna said he had a few comments but I was not I was on a road and I didn't give him a chance I'm saying it real good all right huh so you go ahead you did a bad job okay go ahead okay let's go to Daniel 8 18 through 19. okay 19 through eight 18 through 11. 8 18-11 8 18 18. to 11. because 18 comes before 18 19 oh I see I see what you're saying yeah well let's go let's do annual Daniel 18 through 19. okay and as he was speaking with me I was in deep Sleep on my face towards the ground but he touched me and set me up right and he said behold I will make thee know what shall be in the last and other in the nation for the time appointed the end shall be okay it's Daniel 10 7. 11 to 11 yeah that's one we'll see you don't help me out 10-7 and then and I Daniel also saw the vision for the man that were with me so not division but a great great can fail upon them so that they flee to hit themselves therefore I was left alone and saw this great vision and there remained no strength in me for my communist was turned in me into corruption and I retained no strength yet I heard he had heard I the voice of his words and when I heard the voice of his words then was uh in a deep sleep on my face and my face towards the ground and behold a hand touched me it was set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands and he said unto me oh Daniel a man greatly beloved understand the words that I speak unto thee and stand upright For unto thee I am now sent and when he spoke on these words unto me I stood trembling oh I got a couple of quotes from her uh God's power to transform brother and says every move and the thoughts of the heart is recorded right in another dimension you see even the colors will be closed you wear television color television proves it right out it pulls it out and shows it see and that's just in one dimension from the three they believe and that we live and see and he also said look at Christ standing back here and David couldn't even think now his mind had gone from him as it worked and he was hanging on the cross like you see this statue here hang in on the cross crying my God my God why is Thou forsaken me all my bones they stared me they pierced my hands and feet they trusted my side see why or thou so far from me all the bowls the best come come by pass by they wag their heads at the same he he trusted in God that he would deliver him now let's see if he will deliver him speaking the same word so you see when God was made manifested and heard he said the same verse David did you get it so you see it it's not the word of a man it's the word of God that was God and David there wasn't David he didn't know what he was saying he was just so in the spirit that that's the way Moses was he was so in the spirit passed out of the Dimension that he was living in and stood there face to face and that burning bush talking to God himself said take off your shoes the ground you're standing on his Holy Ground he said I imagine when Moses left there he thought what happened what taken place what was it in the message be beyond the curtain of time brother everyone says I don't know if this one has anything to do but if I like this I don't know he says there it is we just got through speaking here a few weeks to go on how that the human system operates how that there's five senses that you enter the body by and then five Avenues we call it five Avenues such a subconscious imagination and so forth we enter the Soul by it and then when you enter the spirit there's only one Avenue and that is through self-will which spaces it back like Man was created you can receive it or you can just let it go you can accept Christ as a savior or you just let him go and you're still by that tree that one of life and one of dead every human being is set before that tree or God God would be on just to put one there and then not give the other one the equal chance to choose right or wrong and each one of us has that opportunity acts 10 9. sorry about your sleep up oh no sleep soon okay age 10-9 on the moral as they land on their journey and Drew Nye onto this city Peter went up onto the house stuff to pray about the six hour I just keep going on antenna to 16. and he became very hungry and would have eaten but while they made ready he fell into a trance and saw him open and a certain vessel descended unto him as it had been a great sheet net at the Four Corners and led down to the Earth when we're all men are for efooted beast of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and Falls of the air and there came a voice to him rice Peter killed and eat but Peter said not so Lord but I have never eaten anything that is uncommon or unclean and the voice spoke unto him again a second time what God had cleansed that call Nada common this was done twice in the vessel The Vessel was received up again unto heaven now I've been I've been trying to get on the on Joseph so I'm gonna start with my Joseph today so we've got to go to uh Genesis 37. if you got a Scorpio Bob on the bottom how that brother said uh Joseph was a type of Christ and Schofield picks it up on the bottom on page 53 if you have a Schofield model he says well is nowhere a certain that Joseph was the true what was the type of Christ the honor analogic but too numerous to be accidental they are well for special updates of a Father's Love Genesis 37 3 Matthew 3 17 John 3 35 what goes on and on he said both were hated by their brother the Brethren Genesis 37 John 15. this Superior claims that both were rejected let's see her brother and opposed conspire against them to slay them Genesis 37. Joshua was an intent and triggers Lane by his brother as was Christ it became a blessing among the Gentiles and gained a gentle bride as Joseph reconciled his brother to himself and had to work exalted them so will be with Christ and his Jewish brethren Jacob had 12 sons which is also called a 12 tribes of Israel and the names of uh all the all his sons was Reuben Simon Levi Judah Dan Natalie Gap Dasher he's sure Joseph and Benjamin okay let's go uh 37 let's start at 37 1. and Jacob dwell in Atlanta where his father was a stranger in the land of Canaan these are the generations that Jacob Josephine 17 years old was feeding the with his brother and the lab was with a Sansa his father's wives and Joseph brought them to his father their evil report yeah I wanted to go into Joseph because I think he was one of the biggest dreamers in the Bible I mean I mean the whole thing tell us about him dreaming about this and this and that you know now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children because he was a son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors also he loved Benjamin too how come he didn't make him up according code I guess he was because he was a younger one or something and what is when his brother saw that their father loved him more than all his brother they hated him and could not speak peacefully unto him one brother is enough to hate you but you got 11 Brothers in here so and Joseph dreamed a dream and he told it this his brother and they hated him yet the more and he said unto them here I pray you this dream which I have dreamed for behold we are binding she's in the field and low my sheath arose and also stood upright and behold yeshiv stood round about and made obedience to my sheep and his brother said unto him shall thou indeed Reign Over Us or shall die need have a dominion over us and they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words I'm working more and more and more and he dreamed he had another dream and he told his brother and said behold I have dream and dream more and behold the Sun and the Moon and 11 stars made a vision oh senses obedience to me and he told it to his father to his brother his father review came and said unto him what is this dream and now his dream shall I and my mother and my brother indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the Earth and his brother entered him and but his father observed the sand and his brother went to defeat their father's flocking should come and Israel said unto Joseph do not thy brother and Pete the flock and shall come come and I will send thee unto them and like he said him here I am and he said to him go I pray do you see whether to be well with thy brother and well with the flocks and bring me word again so he sent him out of it Bill a hippo and he came to shookum and a certain man upon him and behold he was wondering in the field and the man asked him saying what sick is thou and he said I seek my brother I pray thee where they feed their flocks and the man said they are reporting has for hear them saying let us go to do and Joseph went after his brother and found them a student and when they saw him after a far off even before we came here until then this conspire against him to slay him and they said one to another behold this dreamer cometh come now therefore let us slay him and cast him unto some pit and we will say some evil beasts that devote him and we shall see what he will become of his dreams and Reuben which is his older brother said and Reuben heard it and he delivered him out of their hands and said let us not kill him and Reuben said unto them shed no blood but cast him unto the spirit that is in the will Wilderness and lay no hand upon him that he might read him out of their hands to deliver him to his father again and a cake came to pass when Joseph was coming to his brother if they strive Joseph out of the school his coat of many colors that it was on him and he took him and cast him until Pitt and the pit was empty there was no water in it and they sat down to eat bread and they lifted up their eyes and looked and behold the company ishmaelites came from Hilliard with a camel's bearing spicier mom and myrrh born to carry down to Egypt and Judah said unto his brother what prophet is this we slay our brother and come seal his blood Come and Let Us sell him to this this not our and be upon him for he is our brother and our flesh and his Brethren were contact just like Christ was sold for a 30 pieces of silver so they sold Joseph too that's why he's a type of Christ that's right and there was that they're passed by the immediate a nice Merchant man and they drew and lifted up Joseph other pit and sold Joseph to the ismaelites for 20 pieces of silver and they brought Joseph onto Egypt and Rural government returned onto the pit and behold Joseph was not in the pit and they rented his clothes I guess his older brother carried a little bit about him so at least had 10 ahead brother this day and they took Joseph's coat and then the killer kid of goats and dipped the code in the blood and they they sent the code many clothes and they brought it to their father and said this head we found no now whether it be the son's coat or not and he knew it and said it is my son's code an evil Beast had they borrowed him Joseph is without dog ran in pieces and Jacob read his clothes and put sex cloth upon his Lawns and mourned for his son many days and all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him but he refused to be comforted and he said for I will go down into the grave unto my son morning thus it's about a web for him and the meeting I saw him into Egypt into potiphar and officer apparel and and the captain of the Guard let's go to a chapter 39 because uh chapter 38 talks about Judah and talmar and all that and a lot of preachers talk different different stuff so I'm not going to get in the middle though I'm staying out of that and Joseph was brought down to Egypt and potiphar and officer that Pharaoh captain of that Gordon and Egyptian bought him uh the hands of Israelites which had brought him down hit her and the Lord was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of a semester the Egyptian and his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand and Joseph fundraised in his sight and he served him and he made him overseer over his house and all that he had put into his hand and it came to pass from that time that he made him Overseer in the house and over all that he he had at the Lord blessed the Egyptians house for Joseph said and the blessing the Lord was upon all that he did in the house and in the field and he left all that he had in Joseph's hand and he knew not all he has saved the bread which he did eat and Joseph was a Godly person and well favored and he came to pass after this thing that his master's Wife cast arised upon Joseph and she said lie with me but he refused and said his man until his master's wife behold my master who was not what is with me in the house and he had committed all that he had to my hand and there is none greater in this house than I neither had he kept back anything from me but the because they are his wife oh then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God he didn't say against the powerful he said it against God and he can't pass as she expected Joseph day by day that he heard him not unto her to lie about her to be with her and it came to pass about this time that Joseph went into the house to do his business and there was none of the man of the house there with him and she caught him by this apartment saying lie with me and he left his garment in her hand and flee and God got him out and he came to pass when she saw that he had left His Garment in her hand and was three fourth yeah she called unto the men of her house and he spoke unto them say see he had brought in and he brought unto us to mock us he came in to me to lie with me and I cried with a loud voice lie lie lie sorry and it came to place when he heard that I lift my voice and cried that he left and she laid back she laid up His Garment Day by her until his Lord came home and she's back unto him according to these words saying the Hebrew servant we should have brought unto us came into me to mock me and he came to pass I lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment with me and flee up and it came to pass when his master heard the worst of his wife which she spake on the AMC and after this manner did thy servant to me that this wrath was kindled and Joseph's Master took him and put him into the prison and placed with a king's prisoners were born and he was there in that prison but the Lord was with Joseph and showed him mercy and gave him favor and decide that keep her the prison and The Keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prison that were in the prison and what's that whatsoever they did there he was the doer of it the keeper the president looked not to anything that was under his hand because the Lord was with him and that which he did the Lord made it to prosper let's see if we can do one more and he can't pass after this thing that the butler of the king of Egypt and his favorite had offended the Lord the king of Egypt and Pharaoh was brought against two of his officers against the chief of the Butters and against the chief of the Bakers and he put them in an award in the house of the captain of the Guard into the prison the place where Joseph was bound and the captain of the Guard charged Joseph with him he served them and they continue his season in the war and they dream a dream both of them each man his dream in one night he spent according to their interpretation of his dream the Butler and the Big Brother the king of Egypt which were Bound in prison and Jose came unto them in the morning looked upon them behold they were sad and he asked Pharaoh's officers they were with him in the ward of the it's Lord's House there wherefore look you so sadly today and they said unto him we have a dream we have dream and dream and there is no interpretation of it and Joseph said out to them do not interpretations belong to God tell me then I pray you and the sheep and the Sheep letter told his dream to Joseph and he said to him in my dream behold that mine was before me and in the mind were three branches and it was as though it had butted and her Blossom shot forth and the cluster there are brought forth ripe grapes and Pharaoh's cup was in my hand and took the grapes and pressed them into Ferris cup and I gave the cup into pharah's hand and Joseph said unto him to him this is the interpretation of it the three branches are three days yet within three days shall Fair lift up thy hat I died in a head and restored me unto thy place and I shall deliver a Pharaoh's cup into his hand after the former manner without his thou has where's his Butler but think but think on me when it shall be well with thee and show kindness I pray thee unto me and make mention of me unto pharaoh and bring me out of this house for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into a dungeon and when the chief Baker saw that the interpretation was good he said unto Joseph I also was in my dream and behold I had three white baskets on my hand my head in the uppermost basket there was all men are big meets for the Pharaoh and the birds he'd eat them out of that basket upon my head and Joseph Esser and said this is interpretation thereof the three baskets or three days yet within three days shall Fair lift up the head from thee and shall hang thee on a tree and the bird shall eat thy flesh from off that from alphabete and it came to pass the third day which was Pharaoh's birthday that he made a feast not to all the servants and he lifted up the head of the Chiefs Butler and the chief Baker among his servants and restored the chief but notice Butler began and he gave the cup at the pharaoh's hand but he hung the chief Baker and as Joseph interpreted to him he did not the chief Butler remember Joseph but forget him so get the chief baker said that's pretty good but then she also tells them well I got bad news for you you're gonna you're gonna be hung in three days just like uh when Jesus got crucified because one was saved I'm always lost so I guess the better thank you the news
