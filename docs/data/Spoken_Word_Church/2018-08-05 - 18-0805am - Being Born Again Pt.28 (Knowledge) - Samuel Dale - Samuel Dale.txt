purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of

with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these these promises the star now you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue of knowledge and the knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and God and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity Amen you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word and now we've been quite a time preaching and trying to cover the things that we believe are needful for the day and now where we're living and this is the the greatest hour the Prophet said if he had a change you know of deciding what time or when to come to earth he said he'd be this time the Cosi we're here now at the finality of the word and what we're doing if you're listening we're talking about the disciples and talking about the faith of the fathers and the things you know that they done so remember in that now listen to what I'm saying in that the disciples were writing the word it's more in the statute of a perfect man we've talked about a lot of things and tried to cover things and the Prophet said they had these virtues they had these qualities and things within them when I just remember what he's talking about because he said now virtue as we'll get to it in the mini cities he said now that's not just living a virgin life well I mean you he's not covered not to do that but he's covering that these things are something more valuable to taking place all right than to just say that that's one of the natural things of life that can be a as we'll cover as we go along you can have a nature given faith a nature given virtue all right and that then you could be a virgin in that line and that's well and good that's commendable okay but that's not what the Scriptures talking about in this case so we look at it from what its governing of this word and it it would not agree maybe if you've watched and we will do this as we go along see we could look up the word virtue and he said well that's what that means that this means to be a virgin well that's one definition all right but then you can look it up and and find a the word and it leads into virtuous which would mean the life of Christ living within you well now this is what we're talking about here because really what I want you to think on for a moment before we continue into this that remember these disciples had these virtues all right you realize those virtues gave them the ability to write the word now once you think on that a moment see it's not two virtues and things is not to just living a good life and and doing this and going to church and and and doing everything all that's well and good and part of it all right because you will do that if you're a Christian okay but remember you're talking about a group of people that actually were writing the word Peter in what I've read here from first Peter and then second Peter Peter was writing the scripture he was telling what God was expecting he was bringing God's Word from him down to us and see then it's not just saying well you know we'll get over to temperance that temperance would come to the basis of saying well that just means don't write no liquor don't no alcohol well that's not what that means in this case alright so then we've got to find what is being done for the hour and the time so I want your emphasis to be thinking on this morning on one thing that these disciples are now writing the word it's not just a good life you know come on church I mean that's well and good and is expected and and needs to be a good life right but that's not exactly the lineup of what they're saying that's why the Prophet said virtue doesn't just mean this would be an aversion because that's a natural thing that a nature given virtue or nature given parts of your life can bring you to the basis of these things that we're reading about because there's two different kinds of faith there's two different kinds of virtue two different kinds of knowledge temperance and all I guess one of them is nature given which means you know you've got good neighbors you you got people you like to be around there's people that display a lot of good things in their lives but they're not even Christians right we'll see then there is a Holy Ghost given all right now these virtues no matter what we cover we're start with faith virtue knowledge temperance and I'll remember it's Holy Ghost given His Holy Ghost faith its Holy Ghost virtue is Holy Ghost knowledge is Holy Ghost temperance all right see now that's a higher order are a greater meaning to the word than to take it from the natural word to word that you can have a nature given you know yourself you around people that there's people that are good-natured people as we call it there are good people you know and do a lot of things would help you do anything in the world but don't even claim to be a Christian but then see that's nature given but my emphasis is trying to get you to look at it in this respect this morning as we go along is remember these people were not just listen listen to my wording and then you won't misunderstand they were not just trying to live a good life that's expected of a Christian it's expected of a Christian to live a good life it's expected of a Christian to do good and and and be good and all like that that's expected that's one of the things but that can be that away and still not be what the thing that God wants us to have goes down through time you think of of the time of from Calvary and the coming of the Holy Ghost and coming through the church ages those were great people that gave their life for what they believed that really served God in a deep manner but yet slowly Satan was taking away these virtues that the disciples had right taking away those Holy Ghost given virtues and leaving mankind with a lot of times just natural virtues all right but remember the point in you you get the emphasis of what I'm driving at see the disciples were just not living a good life they were actually leaving the of God and they were actually writing the Word of God right when Peter was saying add to your faith virtue or knowledge temperance play he was writing God's Word when he was just saying that we need to have these things as being born again newborn babes and and then he'd bring it out and Paul would bring out the things and we went through it how Paul was bringing out the adoptions and the things in the Romans and all like that that was the writing of the word all right see we think well you know I'm sure that you're you've thought of it because none else I thought of it all right I'm human that we think about well there were good people those people prior to us were good people that gave their lives for the thing that they believed they gladly walked out and faced death for what they believed but yet these virtues was dying away because that was what was happening the cankerworm pond warm locusts in the caterpillar was taking away the Word of God it was not taken away the Holy Spirit those people still had the Holy Spirit living each day but it was taking away the word in the ages and coming down until it left the church to were not that they didn't have a good life I hope you follow that point those people from Calvary coming down they live good lives it's not necessarily the good life that went away so you could come along and say well well there's that no it's not this it's not just the life going away that they quit living a good life but around covers on Azusa Street and talking about the pea and they're dedicated nough stood and things happen he said they're closer to the Lord they were closer to the Lord than we are now that's a direct quote so you can't argue about the things that he's saying but yet you can argue the point in your mind of whether it's true or not look down through time and see the things to where those people were living great lives those of Zeus's Street people you know they were living great lives 1906 Azusa Street those were wonderful Christian people but yet brother Branham told them said there's where your problem is he said you're born into the family you've got the new birth but he said you stopped on that and said that's not the whole of all of it so then what would do in other words what was brother Branham wanting them to do you think about what him having to stand there and say that to people that were seeing the dead raised the sick heal the many manifestations through the Pentecostal movements and things and yet he says you're not following God's Word the way that he wants it you don't never think like that what would the man be talking about they were living great wonderful lives you can't say anything about their lives they make us ashamed of ourselves is that plain enough to put it we'll see that's the emphases I've made for the pipes few services I'm not trying to get you to live a better life that ought to be automatic that ought to be if we're Christian we're supposed to live a good life right and if we're a true Holy Ghost filled Christian we will but these virtues is not just a life to be given to make us a living a better life do you don't think about what was our purpose what died away what was the thing that that was in the disciples the brother Brennan said they had these virtues these qualities and then all at once you see the ages as it began to die away what begin to die away was the people living a Christian life know that never gardened that doesn't die away those people were living Christian lives what was dying away was the word that was what was eating away was the word all right the word was what was turned down they wanted brother on him with his gifts and all of his things they wanted all of those things but it was the word that was turned down so then it's a restoration of the word is to bring us restoration of the faith of the father's what is the faith of the father's it's the revelation are the life not just to live a good life but the life of Christ to live in us automatically and that we might follow the word of the hour that has been given unto us are you listening what do you think about when we talk about the faith of the father's and that's the emphasis I'm trying to make Peter was writing the word this is the writing of the word that was the faith of the father's they had that Holy Ghost filled faith in their life and capable of receiving from God and writing the actual word that we read Holy Ghost fell people to bring God's Word down to you and I I just live in a good life I know you'll take that and misunderstand it but I'm sorry I don't have the ability to explain it I just see it it wasn't living a good life that was lost in the ages those people had a good life they lived a life to make us ashamed of ourselves it was the word that was lost until we come out and we read as bad this method that's where you come from we read Peter and talked about we needed these things I didn't have to have brother branham to tell me that that the fruits of the spirit was love joy peace goodness meekness um and then coming out to temperance and patience and anything the Bible said that we talked of those things back there and there were good people there oh yes he the only thing you think about was the bad part but they were good people that they're still good people there there's good people right over here in this church there's good people all across the land of of the world that are in church today that are good people that the Prophet would call them Christians we call them unbelievers oh they don't believe this message who do you believe the message what is the message what is the message to you a good life they got us beat good works they got us beat what do you want to know the religious world has got us beat on those lungs what is the faith of the fathers it's the revelation of Jesus Christ for the time and that's what Peter was doing he was riding Christ into natural words to bring it unto us as to what we needed and he says with those of like as we're covering lies not those of like precious faith that was one of the questions what is like precious faith like precious faith is a same faith they had but to a born-again Christian you have a precious wonderful faith if you're just born again you have a precious wonderful faith but we need to like precious faith that the disciples had could God use you in how to write his word oh I know where that goes think oh that's where you flop on it but don't worry you're not flopping on me you're flopping on your own stupidity but see you turn around and say well we're not writing the word gibor cause you can't add to it nobody's talking about adding to the word it's the faith and the father's adding to the word or is that the word if Peter writing to us we look at it as he's writing to the Ephesians or writing to the Galatians or Paul writing to this one life oh I take it easy writing to me when I read the Bible I look at him what he was talking to me because I'm the one that's concerned in it when he said add to your faith virtue huh and says you've come now so far here and said you're doing wonderful you've come out you you're following the truth and you're getting away as you as as we've read over and over and over in in 1st Peter that we've come away from the things of the world and we've gathered into Jesus Christ well see is all that you're thinking about is is the faith of the fathers is just well we just need to get where we can live a better life I agree with you 100% but I still go with one thing living a good life is not the thing it's what causes you to live that life that's where we're dealing it's what's making us live that life we're supposed to live that life the Prophet didn't have to come and tell me that it was wrong to drink alcohol you know what I didn't drink it you didn't have to tell me I don't need to smoke I didn't smoke well you're just one of those weirdos well that's one thing about it if one weirdo can make it another weirdo can make it if you just get weirdo enough I've always believed a Christian life was a Christian life I've never thought it was alright to live in adultery and all kind of garbage cans and things like that I've told you before about it they had a story about a deacon in the church I was in and that Deacon was running around with a woman in the neighborhood but nobody could never prove it I wouldn't talk to him I was like 22 years old I'm maybe 23 24 and he was like 50 more than that I went to his house and talk to him I told him I said the story's out that you're running around what do you say he said I'll give you my word I said okay I'll take your word but I said the fun thing about it if I ever find out you're doing what they say I said I'll take you before the church and I said do you understand what I mean I mean I will physically take you before the church that's the way I live I'm in it my sister-in-law my sister told me in her hood was running around on her and said I wish he'd get out of the house I said give me a word I'll go throw him out I was just human enough that I believed in being right but I told that Deacon and he was well enough to be my daddy and everything yeah probably helped vote me in to be a deacon I told him I said I'll take you before the church if that's ever proved to be that away well I left before he got shot but that was between him and the man but you know I wasn't there but get the point of what I'm talking about I've always believed maybe never achieved yeah okay no problem never achieve my goal as to live a Christian life in Christ I wish I could say I had no but I'm a human being which there's one thing I've always had is a goal in my life to live for Christ to try to be what I could for the people's sake to where they could follow Christ into that line to failed right all right no problem it's just human what do you understand what I'm getting at see the statue of a perfect man is not a place to worth it here we are that we're not living too good we're not understanding some of the things as I've tried to illustrate did the Prophet have to tell you to quit drinking that the problem prophet has to tell you to quit cussing and lying and cheating and doing things like that that was supposed to been done as a Christian oh boy when I got to it I got rid of all of those times and I'm glad of it he now tell me that we were already making our children taking away certain programs on the TV for we ever heard of this message until then they couldn't watch this that in the other the Prophet didn't have to come to tell us a lot of things fault we think that all brother come to do was tell her we wasn't supposed to cut her higher paint her face or men to wear long hair does that that was supposed to be done in Christianity oh boy I heard the Prophet when he told me that I wasn't supposed to lie no more I quit lying if you'd been born again before then you would have no problem about line Oh we'll see that's what gets rough that's where I bring it out like it really is and I don't play or play around with it that's the way it is we were supposed to be Christians before we ever heard of this message if we claim to be Christian before then the life of Christ is automatically to be brought within us to take away these things see just because I'm get this and then we'll move on in the message just because that we think we think that the stature of perfect man is to bring us to being better Christians I'm not trying to make that goal of all we're supposed to already be Christians they were supposed to be settled by the new birds that you receive wherever you receive an A for you heard of the message I have you heard of it or what that's supposed to mean settled on the message was to bring us the word that's what I'm trying to get you to see there Peter was writing the word these people had these virtues you want to know what to fight for the father did with people that had the ability to hear God's Word brought down and to them and brought into their being that they could appreciate out large you faith of the Father that's not just a living good and being good and going to church it was the fact that the word had been eaten away we could still read it he didn't eat it off the pages we could read it and that's what I do it I read it I used to have a better now but I had a good memory of the Bible because I read it constantly I got a decent memory of the Mexico that's what I've done is read and heard it one because I believe it I believe this message is the restoration of God's Word brought to us by the prophet of God in this end time God brought his message to his prophet right we're not looking for another we're talking about it so no yesterday not looking for another messenger to come they asked me a question about what do you think about there I said there's no such thing it's another prophet to come to the Gentile dispensation you said well brother sunchokes but that's between brother so it's on God you give me the Bible foreign you give me the prophets message for it I don't want you around to your opinion or thoughts well what do you think a brother so-and-so that's between brother so-and-so in God that's none of our business that's between them him and God or them in God but there's not to be another messenger to come you can't put it in there you have an eighth messenger and you do away with the prophets message because he was the eighth messenger so people don't even know the message no brother he was the seventh messenger you sure our carnal in your understanding that was what was restored to us was the word the word is what was to be brought by the to us by the prophet of the end time and all I've ever tried to do is just say one let's keep the line up right I've never looked for another messenger to come or somebody to come along and interpret this message to us hmm now I appreciate appreciate the way they preached it there's the interpretation you want to know what the interpretation of 1st and 2nd Peter is it's written on - it's the revelation that was given to Peter - right of what would had happen in his own life and where he had come to and how he was trying to tell us how to come to that place darzee faith to the Father there's your revelation of Jesus Christ there's the Word of God to be revealed to us we don't have to have somebody to to come along now and then try to interpret I've never talked nothing like it the Prophet brought the message if there was any interpreting to be done it would be brought in that stage I like what he said it was interpretation in his own life Peter was bringing the interpretation that was in his own life when he was writing first Peter and second Peter that was the revelation of Jesus Christ in his life there's the faith of the father's the Prophet come to restore us back to that and then God used him to bring things right went on into what was in his life but he had to have the faith it was in those disciples lives brought into his life first and that's why I've always told you I've taught this from the beginning we've had a prophet he brought the message this messenger Malachi for Luke 17 they're gonna do to think what turned the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers 327 church age book right and to tell us about those seven thunders which is a revelation contained in the seven seals and to be these divinely revealed mystery proves that literally turn our hearts back that's the message all right that is to literally then wants to happen see that's what I've said you won't go on with the rest of it you'll go was so far and stop because he then the prophet and the Bible said the fivefold ministry were for the perfecting of the science and brother Branham in the statue of a perfect man said that the fivefold ministry would break this thing down are praying it to the people so hard get it in the right order we got to profit in this message we're not looking for another messenger to come we're not looking for a five fold ministry prophet to raise up that's what people are doing now they may they may try to bring some other prophets if you say something they'll put it in the FIFO you know they move around there they won't spend our steal and say this is what I believe well but I tell you what I believe I believe there ain't no such thing as an addition to the fivefold ministry but a random was brought outside of that because he was the word of he was the one to bring the Word of God his message was outside of the fivefold ministry that's why we must have answer back to that message we don't have a message of her own I've taught you that the fivefold ministry carries his message not if they're supposed to find something their sale we're not in the writing of the word the disciples wrote the word there's not an addition to writing the Word of God even brother Branham bringing those seals in thought that was not an addition to the Bible it was spoke of in the Bible well nobody yet nobody hadn't spoke on it sure it was covered up but it wasn't in an edition if you make it an Edition you make him a false prophet now that's what he said see do we believe it what you see Church trying to get us to look at it the way that it's supposed to be the disciples brought us the Word of God from God through the disciples brother Branham didn't come and correct Peter he didn't come to correct power he didn't come to correct any of the ones writing the word he come to correct you and me from our thinking of what we had or what they we thought they say it he didn't do it that way he come to bring us or restore the word because there's the faith of the fathers the revelation of the fathers I mean he'd stayed at one he said how many gods did Israel have they said they only had one said how many God citizen disciple that they only had one he said how many gods do we have well see we're supposed to just be have one God who the same as rest of them all right but see the face of the father's is the written word of God are you following us all the written word of God was written by the Apostles Paul Peter James John the ones that were writing the word that they got God's Word and put it in the letter for him for you and I we'll see we like to read the Bible but we read it as God talking to somebody else know you'll never understand the Bible if you think keep it in that line of trying to fit for somebody else you got to get it for yourself you got to get it is talking to you behold I send you Elijah the Prophet is that to what the scripture said it was sent to you and I the message was brought to you and I there's no need to try to find another message you can't fit it in it won't go I've had people to talk about well what about a five fold ministry prophet five whole ministry probably ain't no different in the bringing the Word of God than an apostle is matter of fact I can get stricter with you you don't listen to brother Branham brother Brown said there was no none of them that could touch the teacher out of the five fold ministry now that's his word so you do what you want to but see I say it this away the teacher ain't no different nobody else it's not if the word come to the teacher only and then he brings it to the rest of the ministry God reveals himself to a five fold ministry it reveals itself to the five fold ministry and it come by way of the prophets message that was delivered unto us you want to know what the Prophet says read it a simple one what was the faith of the father's brother Dale maybe you've got that any question in your mind why don't you just open your book why don't you just open the Bible why don't you just start reading in the book of Acts folks will be written about Luke and he wouldn't even want to original examples but he got it later and wrote it and the book of Acts was supposed to be written by Luke and then you come on over from there and you get Peter Paul James John you want to know what the faith of the fathers did read the Bible it's simple to make read your Bible well what was the revelation they had read it see because that's what we need I hope you follow me and don't go off on the wrong end of the deal with it I believe in living a Christian life I preached that to you from day one I believe in living a Christian life I don't believe we had to have run around and to come and tell us wrong it was to cut ha it was wrong few women to cut higher you can read the Word of God he didn't have to tell us it's wrong for the women to plank your faith are the men to have long higher and all was ever done he didn't have to tell us that the word said it we were just using the excuse it we didn't understand it till the Prophet came well I'm glad to probably come straighten those things out what did he have to straighten out the Bible tells you not to do them time right the Christian life is a Christian live live the life of Christ living where he comes and lives through you and manifest himself through you but see the revelation of God's Word coming to mankind was bother disciples if you're following me they brought us the word that was the faith of the fathers we don't have to house somebody to interpret that it says it and means it the Prophet come to bring it down into understanding humanly and what was really his understanding done to us was that the Bible was God in letter form what Bill I believe it if it said so and so you already condemned your own self if you say you'd believe it if it said something else you've just condemned your own self come on because you're admitting it's right let's see they come to write the word that's the faith of the fathers is the writing of the word they brought God's Word down to mankind alright Satan took over their nage is an ADA way that understanding there were some people down through those ages and things that understood things but it was eaten away you lost the one God you lost the water baptism you lost the pre destinations you lost all of those things the Prophet had to come not to bring us a different Bible but to take this Bible and show that those disciples believed that these a lot of people think brother Branham I added something when he had a Serpent's eat you ain't read your Bible Paul understood serpent seed you want to stay about three or four days on that get into the book of Romans get into those things Ephesians and on you'll find out he understood a lot of things and he put it down into the letter form he understood predestination he brought it into correct order he didn't have to have brother Branham to come straight and Paul out he was right brother Branham took Paul's letter to bring it to us the word to bring to you and I so we could follow the word this is the hour of the understanding of those things not to rewriting of the book you're gonna try to add to you don't add to the word the seals wasn't not in addition to the word they was already spoke of in the word now to bring it down to give us understanding of it yes we needed that yes but it was already in the word it was written there when brother Brandon went out dirt and Tucson and come back did he start over said let me rewrite this now with we're okay chapter one and two of Revelations and three but said now when we get heretofore we're getting a little heavily you know into and then when we get to six let's rewrite this was already written in the word it was already written in the word it didn't have to be rewritten it had to be understood but you see Church then that comes down to that basis because this is the point they all drunk now and fall over half of the message into where we're going we talked about the virtues in the things and I want you to remember one thing I've said it about two or three times so far the virtues our Holy Ghost given virtues they are not nature given virtues they're not just given because of a natural nature of life and you're a good person whatever that's not what it is it's holy ghost' virtues it's Holy Ghost faith Holy Ghost knowledge Holy Ghost temporize and now remember one time because the I've seen it here and seeing people argue the point here to think about it you cannot start at faith and jump up to brotherly kindness well I don't need these things in between I've what brother the kindness and I'll get next to the headstone I'll turn it upside down out yeah you turned it upside down alright you came add knowledge to faith you add virtue really if virtue is not added to faith virtue is faith in manifestation are you listening to that virtue is actually not a virgin life it's a virtuous life it's a life lived by the Word of God to show us how wonderful God is but it's got to be added to your faith you can't add knowledge to your faith well I said this when I don't think that that see that's where you're going wrong you can't do it but just remember each one of these virtues is the same material no matter what we think of faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness right it's the same material because remember the Prophet emphasized it blaspheme his name and the statue of a perfect man that these these virtues have to be vulcanized together and yet you cannot vulcanize a piece of iron and a piece of rubber you don't do that it's got to be the same material so what is faith it's the new birth it's the revelation of Jesus Christ what is virtue it's adding more to the birth not in the birth of adding more to it to try to make it anything different it's bringing forth the birth into a virtuous life because you can't add virtue until you first get faith it's no good it's just a good life it is just a natural given nature life if you're a good person in that which you've got our faith in first to be born again all right then you can add virtue but don't you say no I'm very I'm just going to add knowledge and then after I get my knowledge and I'll pick up a little further and get this over here it'll help me bring up this back here no no no no no no it won't help you bring it up you got to add it to it it's got to be added one to the other coming up and it's got to be vulcanized together as it's brought so when faith he's brought forth right the Newburg see then you can start talking about virtue or a virtuous Christian or Christ coming and living in you know how does that not enough don't don't do that it won't work I'm trying to tell you it won't work how do you know who called Peter didn't say it if it to work Peter said it that way but he said add to your faith virtue right they don't say then hadn't pitch them it won't come forth he said you had knowledge see you've gotta add virtue and then add knowledge because you would not be able to handle the knowledge if you didn't come forward with a virtue first first is number one you've got to be born again second comes to virtue a virtuous life or a life lived in Christ or things like that and not just natural things so you've got to have that to be able to understand I don't have to have that to understand I just read well why didn't you get it for the profit gain why are we not following you instead of this end time prophet are you getting it I don't mind being that Stern if you think you got it we're supposed to be following you let's see if we lay everything down and follow God's plan but that's where I say you won't do it because what I said want to go the Prophet brought the message how does how can them how can the church come to perfection can't do it without the fivefold ministry why cause the Bible said it because the Prophet said because that solves the problem we aren't on fire I get myself why didn't you get it before the Prophet came here but I don't need it now cuz the Prophet wrote it that's a life to the Satan Cetner just on your shoulder life and not crazy at you you can't do it it's to be revealed that's why I spent so much emphasis in time and the Prophet did he spent his time dwelling on the statue of a perfect man about how you needed to be born again he kept laying the inverses you need to be born again you got to have the faith the faith that the Apostles had you got to come to that new birth because without the new birth your your virtue won't be nothing but just a man-made virtue and all of the bids you'll say then well I well I teach I'm virtuous because I'm gonna virgin well I live I live a good life huh I must be a Christian ain't gonna do it it's whether or not she's born again were you a Christian or not oh you don't believe in being good no I don't believe in being good and never have to out you need to be good I've always taught you need to be born again that's one only thing that will ever make us good of any form is to get the new birth it's not good just because we go to church because we do our thing we pay our tithes we run we do all of these things we try to help them do that oh yeah but that ain't it it's whether or not we're born again whether or not we have the life of Christ living in us and see only with the life of Christ in us can we talk about virtue because if not we'll talk about virtue as some kind of something we can do or not do it's commendable to do or not do that's wonderful to do or not do but that don't make you a Christian if it's an outward affect of what end would work in wonderful shape what you see that's why the Prophet would cover it why would he not go with the natural words of virtue as to leaning back to mort's like something you could do he never went to that line he emphasized it he said not in this case he said it's not to just live a virgin life in the case we're talking about he had something else in mind he was going back into Peters understanding because the natural man would take Peters understanding and bring it to a natural works of something what I didn't I did I'm a virgin well praise God that's a wonderful thing but that don't mean you're born again come on church you said well I don't cut my hair and I don't do that you can have you can have higher drag in your tracks out then they one bit of the salvation in it if it's not something that took place in your heart because in my day a long time ago but in my day there was no short hair girls that were prostitutes they were all long-haired girls because they knew what to hire men that it was something feminists I don't mind talking plain I am playing that's where you'll never accuse this boy of not being straight and playing you know I just can't understand brother Dale you're not listening to reading you don't understand listen to what said because I'm trying my best to make it as plain as I can but see we said what other study the message and I'll get knowledge that's the head knowledge that's hip knowledge wonderful don't lose it right don't lose it when I say I read six books in one day and listen to two tapes I'm not bragging to the point of trying to make it simpler I'm telling the truth I done it but you know what that never turned my soul and whatsoever unless it was what was on those pages was revealed to me those we tried to approach for just a minute of talking about knowledge just remember it's not worldly knowledge it's not head knowledge that the Prophet is talking about it's not head knowledge that Peter is talking about it's not how much you can know or learn or whatever it could be it's like brother Moulton in with a man that he could quote but I forgot how much it was with the Bible but it was a large amount of the Bible and they were discussing one guard with him and he could just quote they were brother George and brother mopin him too he could just quote like that and this quote the Bible this because of his memory but after a while when he faced somebody had a little understanding he wouldn't even pronounce the name of Jesus they brought him to the wall to the point that he wouldn't even pronounce and he'd say literally the Valley Rose Sheriff and they kept him so why don't you call his name because he knew he was in the wrong place he knew he was in a place that his head knowledge didn't do no good and knowledge is wonderful great we need it and only the only way you can ever have a revelation is for God to bring it into your head first they don't come into your heart first it comes into your head faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God it comes true your sense is down into there then it can be revealed until then it's just head knowledge the come on if virtue was not just to live a virgin life how much more is it for knowledge but I know it won't finish this because I'll finish it this afternoon but knowledge knowledge what's the difference in head knowledge and Holy Ghost knowledge you can walk on the Holy Ghost knowledge but you'll never do it on head knowledge knowledge what is knowledge to know that the Bible is not contradictory now what do you think about contradictions in the word do you think there's any contradictions in the Bible now come on I mean okay don't raise your hand don't do too much with me because you get in trouble your own self do you think there's any contradictions in the Bible you think there's any contradictions in this message then why is a 1900 or something denominations maybe more than that thousands as we go back to the 969 the Prophet used to use originally weird all them come from from head knowledge and all of them thought they were contradiction between this and that yes then you said no they never taught it like that they taught a Trinity and they said the Bible was not correct that it was really a Trinity well that's it they said then it's got a contradiction in it right right you can't okay that you don't get in trouble by okay and the truth that I say see they said well oh no there's no contradictions but they just might one right they just made a contradiction out of whether there was one daughter 3 there is no contradictions but they just made a contradiction now listen every one of them did only this end time prophet had the understanding of the one garden correctly so you know what that means 969 Evelyn had contradictions right I couldn't understand that I had trouble when I was in the Baptist Church with that point I couldn't understand why there were so many different churches out of one Bible you didn't ever think like that how that they could be 969 different understandings of one Bible well you know what that means somebody's wrong somewhere so that means if you're right then there's 968 wrong interpretations because you got to deny them is that what you're saying see now they were wrong right because they had contradictions out of the same Bible they had contradiction now what about this message in time people oh no brother you know yourself you heard ministers stand up and proclaim and Swire by the Word of God that there's not a contradiction in this message but where are they today they're the ones today that are turning the message to pieces saying brother Brown was wrong here and run around wrong here I've run down this is that this dates not right here this listen and they're getting their goal I've told you over and over we face the dock turns of the date of the being wrong after our brother branham was hunting and all that that was 1970 we had ministers meeting on those things in 1970 that's not a new thing we had meetings about it then but you know what you had then you had a lot of old people that had the true experience of the Holy Ghost in their hearts and lives a lot of them come from Azusa Street a lot of them had that experience of Azusa Street coming into the message and they wish stood those doctrines and they could not get an inroad into the people they come on Church some of you ain't never been around but I've heard seven thunder virtues and things like that preached so much until it's a mess too worth it they seven boned one was a chiropractor and he had seven bones in the neck and that was the seven bones that meant the seven thunders or the seven seals and there's that in the other you know how two bones in your neck and one of them had Henry Aaron sitting over here and knocking as a grand slam home run to bring everybody else home because he was at number seven but to see people withstood those things and they were not able to carry on very far but today they're not carrying it on they're actually sitting in wondering if these people are right or wrong they can't stand up and say I've got the experience I don't care what to say he said well that brother so-and-so he's got all kind of signs and wonderful praise God the Pope prays for the sick and there he'll praise God anybody's ever he'll praise God God done it no man can thank God for the healing but the person that comes through might be our folks right to see we get into the one great thing of knowledge the Bible says knowledge puffeth up it's the only thing knowledge you'll ever do for your head knowledge they'll just run you up but Holy Ghost knowledge we carry you to your knees you had never wondered I'll give you this now quit you have never been wondering about things you know about doctrines or ideas and things and you were really concerned because you wanted to be right you know you wanted to be saved and be riding like well yet right in the middle of all of that you beginning to wonder who's right and what's right you know and all it wants something that speaks to you and says none of that's right and here's what's right see then you're not worried about who's right and who's wrong because God done told you what's right his words right let people are getting fuss about it we ain't worried about it that's what we were talking about last night in the in the fellowship you know the Bible study we're talking about things that you know you can just argue about you know you can argue over this and I'm natural things you can argue over this and argue over that and you got your point the world is round then these other people come up with the world is flat well what does it matter which way it is well it's gotta be round well why did you profit come up what happened safe that they just figured out this four points to their be I can know how to quote run around said days four points to the earth no he believed it was round that's what I'm getting that's what we're talking about life not we spent about 30 45 minutes talking about it because that was the point you spend all your time talking about where the world was flat or round what does it matter which way it is is it going to save you if you ride by order is flat around they told us that the moon was cheese and they was a rat up there and you could see the holes where he went through the moon that's silly that's what I'm saying we can be plum silly about what we're doing we can sit down and argue over situations or thoughts and that's what the people are doing today they're arguing over the message of this that or the other what does it matter if it's right or wrong but a random said one day he said to black and white or fight again one day and die like flies so you go around the world and print that and that's what they've done they just didn't go to the met next message the next message he said that was my idea that was not God take over $5 lakhs look at him down over here look at him down over there down out your this piece got over there you see that's what we've done we've made all of these things an argument instead of it making the life of Christ knowledge is what's done it we'll take that up this even come on musician will pick that point up this evening to continue the thought knowledge knowledge will destroy us revelation will save us which one is it well I'm just gonna say what the prophet said well what about this other one over here that's saying when two prophets a right could you give me anything I'm as honest inconvenient I've never been you know I'm not smarter than but you give me any quote from brother Branham and give me a little bit of time and this old memory will run you through a quote that seems like it's contrary to that we've done that in the Bible before we heard of the Prophet the Bible said there's no Bible said that we don't know what to believe knowledge puffeth up but headstone knowledge will cut us off but remember you got to go all the way to the headstone to have full knowledge it's the only one of the virtues that we'll cover ever virtue ever virtue is covered by the word knowledge because virtue is a knowledge to you of Jesus Christ temperance patience godliness I'm trying my best to get to that one where brother Branham covers hidden Black's name is night he said you come all this way and said God didn't ever expect you to be perfect until now he says now he'd demand for you to be perfect well we don't know how you gonna be perfect with us mmm that's what I mean it's what I'm getting at let's stand together think on these things the disciples were writing the Bible so by them writing the Bible they could tell us the knowledge of God and it would be holy ghost knowledge and not our intellect what about it oh we got really [Music] spin learn and oppressed in God [Music] will it all [Music] all these ideas and bangs and doctrines through all these 4050 years learn the trustees
