[4:03] sure you get all that figured out to
[4:05] Eaton's and I'll get to which sides
[4:07] you're on and if you don't like your
[4:10] side just move over the other one and
[4:12] show somebody out of a seat and tell
[4:14] them go sit on the other side so they
[4:16] can cook that but we always have a good
[4:17] time together around that time and just
[4:20] you know being thankful and having our
[4:23] Christmas time together too so is that
[4:26] all announcements

[4:36] heavenly father we thank you for the day
[4:38] and the hour that we're leaving thank

[4:44] not and we can depend on you then
[4:46] and we can know for a surety that we can
[4:49] trust you and know what all things work
[4:52] out for our benefit we might not like it
[4:56] at the time but we know that in the
[4:59] finality all things work together for
[5:01] good to them that are de called
[5:03] according to your purpose so we ask you
[5:05] to just have your way with us now and
[5:07] remember the sick ones Lord you promised
[5:10] it in your word you said you sent your
[5:12] word and healed us and delivered us from

[5:17] thank you God each and every one of us
[5:19] now and keep us in Jesus name
[5:21] amen okay we have one message companion

[5:30] and Gabby got through with hers in a
[5:32] hurry this will be up here somebody get
[5:34] it and that's what we're supposed to be
[5:36] doing you know we're not giving these
[5:38] your personal copy
[5:40] it's to be through hurried up as quick
[5:44] as you can don't take two years you know
[5:47] well I'm a slow reader
[5:49] well give it to somebody else let them
[5:51] read and then you'll be lies okay
[5:54] all right but this there is a tape
[5:57] inside of here now so it explains
[5:59] everything and all but there is one copy
[6:01] up here and you take it but just get it
[6:04] get them back in and we give them out
[6:06] and let other people read and you know
[6:09] and enjoy it I really I appreciate it I
[6:12] went through it the other night in one
[6:14] night just reading and I really enjoyed
[6:17] it it's got a lot of information and a
[6:20] lot of pictures in it you know of things
[6:22] that um
[6:24] we are related to in the hour that we're
[6:27] living and uh you know the thing so it's
[6:30] it's really good it's really laid out in
[6:32] a good order all right Revelations 20.
[6:37] and we'll I mean excuse me we'll go to
[6:40] three first verse 20.
[6:43] and then we'll go over to
[6:46] 21. see behold I stand at the door and
[6:50] knock
[6:51] If any man hear my voice and open the
[6:54] door
[6:54] I will come into him and we'll shut with
[6:57] him and he with me
[7:00] now I'm watching that to him that
[7:02] overcometh well I grant to sit with me
[7:04] in now not on
[7:06] in my throne
[7:08] even as I also overcame and I'm sat down
[7:11] with my father in his throne he that
[7:14] half a year let him hear what the spirit
[7:16] saith unto the church is okay let's go
[7:19] to 21
[7:21] and just read this one and we'll try our
[7:24] best to get back to this at the end of
[7:27] the message
[7:28] uh 21 verse 6 and he said unto me it is
[7:32] done I am Alpha Amiga the beginning and
[7:33] the end I will give unto him that is the
[7:36] thirst of the Fountain of the Water of
[7:38] Life freely
[7:40] he that overcome us shall inherit all
[7:43] things
[7:44] now watch all things and I will what
[7:49] be his God
[7:52] and he shall be my son
[7:54] you may be seated in the Lord had his
[7:55] Blessing to the reading of the word
[7:58] now what we've been doing
[8:02] is we've been talking about
[8:04] on the past couple of messages
[8:07] we're still on the positive attitude
[8:09] because remember how we bring that out
[8:12] that anyone in the Bible or really
[8:15] anyone in the natural
[8:17] out in the world uh you know if you
[8:21] don't have a positive attitude you're
[8:23] you're going to be defeated all right
[8:26] because you already are defeated but if
[8:28] you have a positive attitude it does
[8:29] work better but we don't believe in
[8:31] Christian Science Mind Over Matter
[8:33] that's not what we're talking about
[8:35] we're talking about when God speaks to
[8:39] someone
[8:42] then they have a positive attitude
[8:46] all right
[8:47] Peter said
[8:49] I have a more sure word of Prophecy what
[8:53] about a man that had walked with the
[8:55] Lord Jesus for three and a half years
[8:56] been up on the mountain with him saw all
[8:59] of the things but yet he comes down one
[9:01] day and he says I have a more sure or we
[9:04] have a more sure
[9:08] more positive attitude
[9:10] why because he had something reeled in
[9:13] all right he had a New Birth by then see
[9:15] that was the point all right
[9:17] but now we've been talking about death
[9:21] death you know
[9:23] what is death
[9:25] and how can we destroy it
[9:29] all right now that's the point
[9:32] all right now we found that death
[9:35] it's not just dying going to the
[9:37] Undertaker you know and say oh they died
[9:39] you know
[9:40] no because you don't die there
[9:42] your soul will live on no matter what
[9:45] you are if you're a sinner or a saint
[9:47] your soul will live on after the body is
[9:50] taken to the Undertaker and placed in
[9:52] the ground
[9:53] all right
[9:55] but we found it like John 3 and 18 says
[9:59] he that believeth not is condemned
[10:02] already
[10:03] you realize if we don't believe that
[10:06] we're already dead
[10:09] the woman the Bible says the woman that
[10:11] lives in pleasure is dead while she
[10:12] liveth
[10:14] all right now that's you know we're not
[10:17] dead we're spiritually Dead all right so
[10:21] now what did we bring down death to be
[10:24] unbelief
[10:27] what killed Eve in the garden to
[10:29] disbelief
[10:31] disbelievable God no she believed in her
[10:34] God she could tell you about him she
[10:37] done some pretty good preaching to the
[10:38] Beast
[10:39] all right the serpent dark
[10:42] all right but yet still there was
[10:45] something wrong and her problem the
[10:47] prophet said was she doubted God
[10:51] keeping his word
[10:52] and she disbelieved according to Hebrews
[10:55] 13 8 what that he's the same yesterday
[10:57] today and forever and if we believe that
[10:59] to be true we know he'll keep his word
[11:01] right
[11:03] all right see so now the worst thing
[11:05] that we could have is unbelief
[11:10] all right
[11:11] when I brought a day of blessed God I
[11:12] don't have no unbelief
[11:14] well
[11:16] pray I hope that's true you know I hope
[11:19] it's true
[11:20] what's revealed to us
[11:24] you know
[11:25] that there's no unbelief in what's
[11:27] revealed to us
[11:29] but like I was trying to bring out their
[11:31] Sunday lack of information or lack of
[11:34] understanding would bring us to unbelief
[11:37] we started off in this message as really
[11:40] unbelievers right because this message
[11:42] was so strange to us and and different
[11:45] from what we had read and studied and
[11:48] thought of of mankind so we really
[11:51] started off as unbelievers
[11:53] and God came down and changed that and
[11:56] made us to be Believers all right
[11:58] we'll see
[12:00] then if there's any doubt in our mind
[12:04] you think about Eve being mixed up on
[12:07] Hebrews 13 8. now you think about how
[12:08] small that would be
[12:11] we want to look at the dirty the
[12:13] problems the thing remember all of that
[12:15] came from the point of unbelief
[12:18] she was dead before her and the Beast
[12:22] came together to bring forth a child
[12:25] all right because of her unbelief
[12:30] amen right now what I'm saying she
[12:33] believed in God
[12:34] well brother Delaware did I just got to
[12:36] believe in God
[12:39] now what did the prophet say that we
[12:40] gave you the quote he said the unbelief
[12:43] in God who is the word
[12:50] so now if we have any unbelief
[12:55] you know about the word
[12:58] look where we're at all right you know
[13:01] that really unbelief is so hard I'll
[13:04] just quote these because you shouldn't
[13:05] know them anyway
[13:07] but unbelief is so of a bad thing that
[13:15] according to paragraph e found now these
[13:18] are not only things right
[13:21] about Thy word preaching 48. he cannot
[13:25] save you
[13:26] against your own will
[13:30] he cannot heal you against your own will
[13:33] you must believe that he is and a
[13:36] rewarder of those who diligently seek
[13:38] him is that right
[13:41] now what about the one thing that God
[13:43] can't do
[13:45] I mean you think about it he he can do
[13:48] all things but the one thing he can't do
[13:52] is save you if you don't want to be
[13:54] saved
[13:55] all right
[13:57] he didn't cometh God must believe that
[13:58] he is amen amen right
[14:01] all right
[14:02] now he goes on to a 1954 with a title of
[14:05] the same thing
[14:08] at Thy word Lord
[14:10] he says he cannot heal you he cannot
[14:13] save you or do one thing for you until
[14:17] you first accept it and believe it and
[14:20] confess it
[14:22] and remember in in the scriptures are
[14:24] you know in Romans you got to believe in
[14:27] the heart confessed with the mouth right
[14:30] all right not just one time you've got
[14:32] to be both he said that's right you've
[14:35] got to confess it now watch not you got
[14:37] to feel it
[14:40] you got to confess it he's not the high
[14:43] priest of your feelings
[14:49] he's the high priest of your confession
[14:52] all right
[14:56] and look what he gets down on the
[14:57] message called expectations in 1958
[15:00] he said unbelief is a miserable thing
[15:06] he said it's terrible
[15:09] it's death
[15:11] Shadows of death
[15:13] is unbelief
[15:15] all right
[15:16] now so then that's what we've been
[15:18] trying to bring out
[15:21] let's see
[15:23] we can holler all we want to we believe
[15:25] the message
[15:28] but has it been revealed to us
[15:33] oh we believe in one God
[15:35] all right Eve did
[15:39] right
[15:41] well yet she brought death
[15:44] physically spiritually in everything
[15:46] upon mankind
[15:48] by her unbelief
[15:51] you see our problem today is our
[15:52] unbelief
[15:55] right
[15:58] do you say but brother Dale I believe
[16:01] everything the prophet said
[16:08] but you know that's a big mouthful
[16:13] you know if you believe that
[16:15] you won't miss a service unless you're
[16:17] in hospital
[16:19] or bad sick
[16:23] I know I'm dirty okay
[16:26] but is it true amen amen now you answer
[16:29] the question
[16:31] but brother yeah I know I know what the
[16:33] scripture says Jesus said you'd have had
[16:36] a cloak for your covering if I haven't
[16:37] spoke to you
[16:40] you said but yet
[16:42] well okay
[16:44] what is death
[16:46] unbelief
[16:49] he cannot save you
[16:53] against your will
[16:58] now that's that's what death that's what
[17:00] I've been driving that
[17:02] yeah but you just don't understand
[17:05] don't understand what
[17:10] I understand one thing
[17:12] whether you believe it or not we're
[17:14] dying
[17:17] you can pump up all you want to and
[17:19] stand in front of the mirror and put
[17:21] yourself up
[17:22] it don't make no difference
[17:26] we're dying
[17:28] and we're going to keep on dying until
[17:30] somebody recognizes
[17:33] the real death
[17:35] or what it is you remember how we
[17:37] brought it out
[17:39] even under the line Ministry that we'll
[17:41] get back in a minute
[17:43] it didn't call him death
[17:46] he didn't give him a name
[17:48] it was just an antichrist a spirit Etc
[17:52] under the ox
[17:54] the great time it was still not that
[17:57] under the man of the great intelligence
[18:01] it was not called Death
[18:03] but under the eagle
[18:07] then the eagle would be the only one to
[18:09] understand what is really death
[18:14] you understand that
[18:16] might give you a good thought to go back
[18:18] and read to see a book
[18:20] you might learn a lot
[18:22] and read it from a point of trying to
[18:24] find our unbelief
[18:27] and then you'd see why that I'm so what
[18:31] is the word adamant strong arrogant
[18:34] hateful whatever you want to call it
[18:36] this make your word up for yourself
[18:38] against doctrinal issues and things that
[18:42] I do not agree with
[18:46] because if I allow that to come Among Us
[18:50] then I'm allowing according to my
[18:52] understanding deaths to come Among Us
[18:56] make anybody
[18:58] uh take the word
[19:01] no more than God can heal you
[19:04] if you don't believe it
[19:06] all right
[19:07] but see that we can stand on the word
[19:09] and say well okay
[19:11] we believe that
[19:13] but I hope you was following me even
[19:15] down through that we brought on in how
[19:18] that death would be destroyed
[19:21] and the only way that death can be
[19:23] destroyed is by the revealed word
[19:28] why wouldn't you want the revealed word
[19:31] I just want to go to church and be a
[19:33] good person that's good
[19:40] I'd rather read all these other books
[19:42] and things and do this and
[19:44] okay
[19:47] get on your Facebook and stay all day
[19:52] you know more about each other
[19:54] than you do about the word
[19:57] have we let down on our children and
[20:00] things of teaching them about Jesus
[20:03] Christ
[20:05] are letting them just
[20:07] all they know is what we know and what
[20:10] we fool with
[20:11] okay
[20:13] but you know death is so horrible
[20:17] until
[20:19] even though the scripture tells you in
[20:23] Revelations 20 and 10
[20:27] it talks about the devil
[20:30] is cast into the Lake of Fire
[20:34] and destroyed you know that's the
[20:36] purpose of it all right
[20:38] then it says
[20:42] in chapter 20 and verse 14 that death
[20:45] and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire
[20:50] this is the second death
[20:53] all right
[20:56] now I brought it out Sunday and you know
[20:59] kind of withheld a little bit back on
[21:01] that part for you to think on it because
[21:03] see when you say well what is the second
[21:04] death death of the Soul
[21:07] well that's good we've learned that
[21:10] you know that's wonderful
[21:12] we've learned that
[21:14] we've learned that the second death is
[21:17] the death of the soul and blessed he at
[21:19] part in the first resurrection over
[21:21] which the second death hath no part
[21:23] see I spend too much time on other
[21:25] things and don't get the end of a
[21:26] message you know but
[21:28] I'd hoping you're thinking a little
[21:30] about it
[21:31] but what about
[21:34] what kind of a lake is that
[21:39] when even the devil
[21:43] is annihilated in the Lake of Fire
[21:47] the Beast and the false prophet
[21:50] yep
[21:51] are put in the Lake of Fire
[21:54] annihilated
[21:56] because it can't be no such thing as
[21:58] eternal hell
[21:59] right
[22:02] so then it's got everything outside of
[22:05] eternal life it's got to be annihilated
[22:08] amen all right
[22:10] and then see
[22:13] true that the life the second death is
[22:16] the death of the Soul yeah
[22:19] because if that soul is not born again
[22:21] one day it will be destroyed
[22:24] so there's no such thing as eternal hell
[22:27] in those things you'd have to have
[22:30] eternal life to live in hell
[22:32] eternally and that put God's own life
[22:34] there so that won't work all right but
[22:37] what about then the point
[22:39] then I should have spent about four
[22:40] hours on Sunday his death and Hell
[22:45] death and Hell itself
[22:49] has to be annihilated
[22:52] coaches cast into the Lake of Fire
[22:54] that's the second death the scripture
[22:57] says
[23:01] why because
[23:03] the death of an individual is the death
[23:05] of the soul that would be you know no
[23:07] Eternal Health we'd understand all right
[23:10] but where did that come from it comes
[23:11] the devil so cast him in there and let
[23:13] him be annihilated
[23:16] that's what the scripture says
[23:22] then to turn around and say even the
[23:26] death
[23:28] that would destroy
[23:31] annihilate the devil in hell
[23:35] it will have to be destroyed
[23:40] because that's what scripture said then
[23:42] it says this is
[23:44] the second death
[23:49] you see it would have to be some some
[23:51] form of
[23:52] spiritual points as well as literal
[23:55] because all demons you know Devils
[23:59] Etc everything that would be perverted
[24:02] would be annihilated
[24:05] and only those with eternal life will
[24:07] escape that
[24:09] right all right
[24:10] so you see how important it is for us to
[24:12] get the new birth
[24:14] all right
[24:16] but now
[24:18] I want us to think about something
[24:20] tonight
[24:22] and relate back to that
[24:25] and and watch it now because I'm telling
[24:28] you what I'm doing so that you won't
[24:31] forget it in the message
[24:34] is we're trying to find the day that
[24:37] we're living
[24:39] in the word of God
[24:42] right
[24:44] well now
[24:46] what good would it do to find the day of
[24:49] somebody else's living what good is that
[24:52] to you and I
[24:53] that's already passed
[24:58] but we need to find the day we're living
[25:02] so go back and listen to that message
[25:04] brother random pre recognizing your day
[25:07] and its message
[25:08] well it's only to recognize God sent a
[25:10] prophet
[25:12] well
[25:15] why would he speak of the Bride
[25:18] being the fullness of the godhead bodily
[25:21] if that's all you need to know
[25:24] well that's just quotes you've come up
[25:26] with well
[25:28] I guess you just throw away what you
[25:31] don't want
[25:33] sister Barbara's husband he's
[25:36] you know
[25:37] what Islamic or what you want to call it
[25:39] I don't know what they call all of them
[25:41] but anyhow he said I believe the Bible
[25:46] should you do
[25:47] he said yeah
[25:52] yeah I said in other words you believe
[25:54] what you want to believe
[25:57] what you believe is right
[26:01] that's the way you believe the Bible and
[26:03] he started grinning he said yeah
[26:05] I said but something is contrary to what
[26:08] you're saying
[26:11] you don't believe that
[26:13] no no
[26:15] all right but think about it now
[26:21] looking for our day
[26:25] not looking for Luther's age Wesley's
[26:28] age Pentecostal age
[26:30] um Paul's age whatever
[26:34] but what is to be in our age
[26:37] all right now each age gets a message to
[26:41] the overcomer
[26:43] all right
[26:46] so we read about the Overcomer to the
[26:48] lady of CNAs that that overcomer
[26:51] will sit with him in his throne
[26:56] even as he has set in his father's
[26:58] throne
[27:00] huh
[27:01] now
[27:03] listen to the point
[27:06] we will cover the ages of each overcomer
[27:12] but remember
[27:13] that is uh
[27:16] to cover each age where we're doing
[27:19] individually but what that's doing is
[27:22] just relating that age to the time that
[27:24] was there
[27:26] right
[27:29] now
[27:31] like a characteristic
[27:33] you remember the prophet when he brought
[27:35] out about the seven Church ages that you
[27:38] find down in what is Asia Minor that was
[27:40] you know that the seven Church ages you
[27:43] know the seven churches is there
[27:46] you know there was a lady of sea and
[27:47] there was Philadelphia all those
[27:49] churches were there and all he was using
[27:51] that far in the scriptures was was to
[27:55] relate a characteristic
[27:57] of that City
[28:00] in relation to
[28:03] you know the people right
[28:05] so now follow that thought
[28:08] as we cover the Overcomer of each age
[28:13] think about
[28:16] the part that is
[28:18] spoken of
[28:23] but keep a lot of things keep it in your
[28:25] mind
[28:27] we'll get to that in a minute
[28:30] we've been through these so we don't
[28:32] have to give them but
[28:37] each age
[28:41] has had a part to do
[28:44] right amen
[28:46] amen each age it had a part of the word
[28:48] if you want these I'll be glad if they
[28:50] want to just run them up darn and let
[28:52] you read them as I talk a little bit go
[28:54] ahead to 1A and then we'll drop down
[28:56] through
[28:57] uh one A B and C go ahead and let them
[29:01] run and just think about it
[29:04] each age
[29:05] has had a part of the word
[29:10] right
[29:12] to be made manifest in that age
[29:15] okay
[29:18] so then each one would be something
[29:20] related
[29:22] a revelation of Jesus Christ
[29:26] because the book is a revelation of
[29:28] Christ
[29:29] right
[29:30] so each aides would have something
[29:33] connecting to
[29:36] revelation
[29:38] all right
[29:42] so then He makes himself known in his
[29:46] promises
[29:49] that's it is I'll Be not Afraid all
[29:51] right go to the next one
[29:53] B each age had its message and its
[29:57] messenger
[29:58] all through times ever age has packed
[30:03] its message with a messenger
[30:05] God in every dispensation is sent for
[30:08] someone Anointed with the Holy Spirit to
[30:11] bring forth his message for that age
[30:13] all right
[30:16] God's provided way
[30:18] for this day
[30:19] but each age has
[30:21] it's part of the Gospel
[30:24] already predicted
[30:28] this Bible is a complete revelation
[30:31] of Jesus Christ
[30:33] all right
[30:35] now
[30:38] so each age has a part of the word
[30:42] all right
[30:44] and it's a complete revelation of Jesus
[30:46] Christ so you can't leave out
[30:50] you can't come along and jump over and
[30:52] say we don't need Luther we don't need
[30:53] Wesley we we don't need they are the
[30:57] foundation that is holding us up whether
[30:59] you like it or not
[31:01] and each age had a part of the
[31:04] Revelation so if you leave that age out
[31:08] look what you're doing
[31:11] you're leaving out a part of the
[31:13] revelation of Jesus Christ
[31:18] are you following me
[31:22] so now when we come into the
[31:25] oh
[31:27] overcomer
[31:30] I want you to think about something
[31:35] now we'll get back to the scripture why
[31:37] we read that
[31:39] of all things
[31:42] but I want you to think about something
[31:47] to isolate an age
[31:51] and to put it by itself
[31:53] is not the form that God would desire to
[31:56] be done
[31:58] each age would be a part of the
[32:00] revelation of Jesus Christ
[32:03] and if we leave any of that out we would
[32:05] leave out a part of the revelation
[32:08] but it's so wonderful how he does things
[32:17] now here's a quote I want you to take
[32:18] and I want you to consider it for a long
[32:21] time go ahead with one D
[32:24] which is taken on how can I overcome 63
[32:27] 8 25 in the morning service he's coming
[32:30] down and he's reading how that he didn't
[32:33] overcome what would be a pillar of fire
[32:34] you know that's the part of these six
[32:38] Church age all right we'll get back to
[32:40] that in a minute I said watch what the
[32:42] Overcomer has promised see
[32:45] now now lady Lucia that's the last
[32:48] Church age
[32:49] there is going to be some Overcomers in
[32:51] there watch here
[32:52] they remember each Church age
[32:56] the one preceding
[32:59] it
[33:01] inherits
[33:03] all that the other ones
[33:05] offered
[33:09] so you know where you go wrong if you
[33:11] isolated any age
[33:14] you would have a part of the revelation
[33:16] of Jesus Christ and he wouldn't be
[33:17] Hebrews 13 8
[33:21] and then you'd be wrong to say
[33:23] if the Overcomer could inherit all
[33:25] things
[33:29] so then
[33:30] keep in mind what is said there
[33:33] the age that precedes
[33:37] that sounds contrary to
[33:39] calculating humanly
[33:42] but it's wonderful revelation
[33:45] the preceding the age before
[33:50] right
[33:52] inherits what the next age
[33:55] brings
[34:03] that sounds contrary don't you
[34:08] see we look at it like this age
[34:12] put him over there this age gets that
[34:13] put him over there they say he's get
[34:15] that put him over there
[34:19] now what are you going to do with the
[34:20] scripture that I read in wrong in
[34:21] Revelations 21 7.
[34:24] said the Overcomer inherits all things
[34:27] and I'll be his God
[34:29] and he'll be my son
[34:36] should we stay right there for hours
[34:38] till you can get it clear out of your
[34:40] mind that you are different with me
[34:42] about what I'm saying
[34:45] well read it
[34:48] I didn't write it
[34:50] I wasn't the one that said it
[34:55] the preceding age is the age before
[35:00] the one that precedes
[35:02] you know
[35:05] Danny's not as old as I am
[35:07] I preceded him
[35:10] he didn't precede me
[35:14] all right are you with me
[35:17] the preceding age
[35:20] what that age gets the next age gets
[35:24] with what they got
[35:30] right you see that's where you're going
[35:31] to differ with me
[35:33] so go ahead
[35:34] but go home and pray about it
[35:39] because you're facing scriptures
[35:43] so then you're going to cut yourself off
[35:44] and you'll allow the unbelief
[35:47] all right
[35:49] well my brother Dale I just don't
[35:50] understand you is that unbelief not
[35:52] necessarily but when you go around and
[35:55] you talk to everybody else about what I
[35:58] say it
[35:59] and don't come to me you're in unbelief
[36:05] amen
[36:08] I didn't write the book
[36:12] but listen
[36:16] see watch it as we come down
[36:19] that you take an age
[36:23] you take an overcomer of that age
[36:28] and whatever he inherits
[36:32] the next days don't just get apart
[36:35] it gets what they got
[36:39] Plus what's made known for that age
[36:42] now watch that as we go through because
[36:44] if you don't get that right you're going
[36:46] to have this over here and you're going
[36:47] to have this over here and you're really
[36:49] going to cut yourself off
[36:53] so let's just read something and think
[36:55] about it
[36:57] go ahead brother and pull up number one
[36:58] unless we're going to read the Overcomer
[37:01] of each age I'm going to just make a
[37:03] comment to each one of them just on the
[37:05] basis of you know little things
[37:09] well we start off in Revelations 2 7.
[37:14] he said he didn't happen here let him
[37:16] hear what Spirit saith in the church to
[37:18] him that overcome it I'll get give to
[37:20] eat or the Tree of Life
[37:22] which is in the midst of the paradise of
[37:23] God
[37:24] now what does that age get
[37:28] the Overcomer of that age what did it
[37:31] get
[37:35] to eat of the Tree of Life
[37:39] where is that at it's in the midst of
[37:41] the paradise of God what did the first
[37:42] church age get
[37:46] the new birth
[37:50] come on we got to start from there
[37:51] because it's starting on day of
[37:52] Pentecost right sure
[37:55] First Church age
[37:56] starts with a new birth
[38:03] then the Overcomer of that age grows in
[38:06] that new birth
[38:12] are you following it
[38:14] to the Overcomer of the age
[38:17] he grows in that new birth
[38:22] it started on a day of Pentecost
[38:26] with 120
[38:30] and they had to fight to the fathers
[38:33] but on the day of Pentecost outside
[38:35] there was three thousand
[38:37] and they only got the new birth
[38:41] you'd be surprised how many people don't
[38:42] preacher don't even know that
[38:45] but you can't make that three thousand
[38:47] outside of the same
[38:50] understanding as the 120 was in the
[38:53] upper room
[38:55] look where you're leaving it out the
[38:57] great wonderful understanding
[38:59] but get what I'm talking about
[39:02] to the Overcomer of the age
[39:05] he not only gets the new birth
[39:10] but he gets a special revelation of
[39:14] Jesus Christ
[39:15] to him
[39:18] that that is the Tree of Life
[39:24] contrary to the tree of death
[39:27] that was in the garden
[39:29] aren't you following me
[39:34] all right look at your next one
[39:36] Revelations 2 11 and let's see
[39:39] either that or near what it
[39:41] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[39:43] the churches
[39:45] he that overcome or shall not be hurt
[39:48] of the second death
[39:52] now
[39:57] if you just walk out there with that by
[39:59] itself what have you got
[40:04] you know if you just isolate an age
[40:08] look what you've got
[40:12] you're going to have to find out what
[40:13] the second death is you're gonna have to
[40:15] find out all of those things
[40:18] but if you'll take the order of the
[40:20] prophet and the way he's bringing it
[40:25] that the first church age starts off
[40:26] with a new birth
[40:30] and didn't get so strong
[40:33] in relation to the Tree of Life
[40:36] that was in the garden
[40:41] I believe those people back there
[40:43] understood a lot more about serpent seed
[40:45] than we think we did they did you know
[40:48] that's up to you but
[40:50] I believe even them Pharisees understood
[40:53] a lot about serpent seat
[40:55] why would they tell Jesus we weren't
[40:57] born a fornication
[41:01] all right
[41:03] but are you with me now
[41:05] second Church age he didn't overcome or
[41:07] shall not be heard of the second death
[41:08] why because in the first
[41:12] he's already if he takes what's brought
[41:14] to him from the first age
[41:16] the preceding age
[41:18] is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[41:23] in the tree of life
[41:28] now
[41:29] you take the second Church Age and what
[41:32] he come up with
[41:33] he didn't overcome or shall not be heard
[41:35] of the second death
[41:36] so you know right then that you don't
[41:39] have to worry about your second death
[41:42] it's already been taken care of
[41:45] it because see you're just laying on top
[41:47] of that early age
[41:50] and coming out with the revelation of
[41:51] Jesus Christ
[41:53] in the second age we still not forget
[41:55] the revelation of the first age
[42:00] but builds upon there
[42:03] are you with me
[42:09] the Third Church age what is it
[42:10] Revelation 2 17. he didn't have an ear
[42:12] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[42:14] the churches to him that overcometh I
[42:16] will get give to eat of the Hidden manna
[42:20] what
[42:21] and will give him a white stone
[42:26] and in the Stone
[42:28] a new name written
[42:31] which no man knoweth that he that
[42:33] receiveth it
[42:39] isolate that
[42:41] and what is your foundation
[42:45] with that put that Revelation that would
[42:49] be coming there upon
[42:52] that new birth
[42:55] that tree of life
[42:58] that revelation
[43:00] that you can't die
[43:02] God blessed is he that hath part in the
[43:04] first resurrection over which part the
[43:06] second death hath no part
[43:08] see
[43:12] and now the Third Church age
[43:16] you see about
[43:20] we will get to that
[43:23] here in the Third Church age
[43:27] they get a hidden Manna what did
[43:29] everyone say special revelation
[43:31] going to church ages and read it
[43:34] come on
[43:36] you got time enough to fuss about it on
[43:38] the telephone and tell others you don't
[43:40] agree
[43:40] or talk to them but you ain't got time
[43:42] to sit down and read the church age book
[43:46] to see if what I'm saying is true
[43:52] and if you need it out to say your books
[43:53] Mr Christine will just give you what
[43:55] page number it is
[44:00] look
[44:03] I'll give him a white stone
[44:10] we could spend nights on just each one
[44:12] right
[44:13] and in the stone a
[44:16] new name written
[44:20] which no man North saving he that
[44:23] receiveth it
[44:26] now
[44:28] do you know that we've all got
[44:34] all happy you remember that
[44:36] we're Christians
[44:39] keep stacking up the Revelation one on
[44:42] top of the other and you'll find out
[44:44] what I'm talking about but isolate the
[44:47] age by itself as an individual part
[44:51] you're not believing in Hebrews 13 8.
[44:56] you're not walking into Revelation as it
[44:58] comes Higher and Higher and Higher and I
[45:01] thought that's what we believe the only
[45:03] way you could get the virtues was for
[45:04] the Revelation I thought the only way we
[45:06] could overcome death
[45:09] was by revelation
[45:15] look at the fourth one
[45:20] Revelation 2 26 28. he didn't overcometh
[45:25] and keep with my works
[45:28] unto the end
[45:34] hmm
[45:37] to him I will give power over
[45:40] the Nations
[45:45] and he shall rule
[45:47] the nations with a rod of iron
[45:51] as a vessels of a power shall they be
[45:53] broken to Shivers even as I received of
[45:56] my father
[45:58] and I'll give him the Morning Star
[46:05] check that if you want to
[46:08] you don't have to translate it
[46:10] but if you'll check it the word Works
[46:12] can be used as word
[46:18] he that keepeth my word
[46:22] and to the end
[46:24] but let's turn it around and leave it
[46:26] works and not worry about it
[46:28] because if Works don't follow our
[46:31] revelation
[46:32] what is our Revelation worth anything
[46:36] okay
[46:38] but add all of this on to what you've
[46:41] already seen
[46:44] the new birth
[46:47] a tree of life
[46:49] the second death can hurt us
[46:54] keep adding it up
[46:57] remember
[46:58] the preceding age
[47:02] ties together to the next one it's like
[47:04] Star stems right and watch now even into
[47:08] the fourth age
[47:11] now may I go back to the seals just to
[47:14] hire
[47:15] the first church age
[47:18] started out with a line
[47:21] of the tribe of Judah
[47:24] all right
[47:25] that lasted somewhere in the
[47:27] neighborhood of Three Ages
[47:29] I say in the neighborhood called run
[47:31] around and we'll move it backwards and
[47:32] forth
[47:34] but he says he comes to taitara
[47:38] which is your fourth is that right
[47:41] see Columbus
[47:44] and he said then you're starting your ox
[47:47] he said to Pure unadulterated word
[47:49] lasted three ages
[47:51] up to the fourth age or part of the
[47:53] fourth age all right
[47:55] so then you bring it in your combat
[47:57] Beast
[48:01] in another way of looking at it you pull
[48:04] out one of those beasts
[48:06] what have you got
[48:09] you better consider what I'm talking
[48:11] about
[48:13] let it keep piling Revelation up on top
[48:16] of Revelation
[48:21] might give you an OP an interest in
[48:23] going back and reading the church age
[48:25] book
[48:28] and listen to see if these things are
[48:30] right
[48:31] but watch the fourth age
[48:36] to keep with my Works under the end
[48:39] will I give power over the Nations
[48:44] now if that's an unrelated
[48:47] Revelation that connects to nothing else
[48:49] now where are you
[48:51] the fourth Church age definitely was not
[48:54] ruling over Nations
[49:00] but it's a promise to the Overcomer of
[49:03] the fourth Church age that he'll sit on
[49:06] the throne
[49:07] with Jesus in the Millennium because our
[49:10] story is going to rule the Nations
[49:14] so you see what I'm talking about
[49:17] it keeps climbing higher and higher
[49:19] doesn't it all right and I'll give him
[49:22] the Morning Star a special revelation
[49:30] of Jesus Christ
[49:33] but roll down number three
[49:36] rather for me
[49:39] okay
[49:42] now what have you got
[49:45] you're gonna give him a Morning Star
[49:49] it's a special revelation of Jesus
[49:51] Christ
[49:52] but it's a special revelation of what
[49:55] he's making his people
[50:00] the Morning Star
[50:02] remember the Morning Star is the evening
[50:05] star
[50:07] right
[50:11] is that true
[50:13] the morning Stars the evening star it's
[50:15] just a position it is in the heavenlies
[50:17] right okay go to number five
[50:20] try to get in a hurry
[50:24] all right
[50:26] so he says diced a few names even in
[50:28] Sardis which have not defiled their
[50:30] garments look what a beautiful statement
[50:32] about them
[50:33] and they shall walk with me in white
[50:36] for they are worthy
[50:39] he that overcometh the same shall be
[50:41] clothed in white Raymond
[50:47] I thought we believed that white
[50:48] Raymonds was the righteousness of the
[50:50] Saints
[50:51] is that scriptural
[50:53] what and I will not
[50:55] blot out his name
[50:58] out of The Book of Life
[51:01] even though now listen even though by
[51:05] the field Church age they had went into
[51:07] organizationalism
[51:13] oh
[51:15] dares were people who are again
[51:19] that real bride never went no
[51:21] organization you better read again
[51:26] your Prophet said that the bride went
[51:28] down to and I see a Rome so you
[51:31] interpret all you want to
[51:35] by the fifth Church age they had done
[51:37] lost to revelation of the name of Jesus
[51:40] right
[51:43] now they didn't lose the name come on
[51:46] they didn't call him Charlie Jim or Joe
[51:49] right that's not what it's meaning
[51:52] they had lost the name
[51:55] and they come up with a name that they
[51:57] were living
[52:01] am I in the scripture
[52:04] all right
[52:06] clothed in white Raymond and I'm not
[52:08] blowed out his name out of The Book of
[52:10] Life
[52:12] but even though he's a trinitarian
[52:15] come on that's what they come out with
[52:17] Luther was a trinitarian we actually was
[52:20] a trinitarian trinitarianism state until
[52:22] associate and even after Azusa Street
[52:26] it was still in trinitarianism and so is
[52:29] it still today
[52:32] all right
[52:34] I'll confess his name before my father
[52:38] he's going to be just as happy to call
[52:41] the name of Luther
[52:42] is he is to call William Branham
[52:45] now you'll differ there go ahead
[52:48] you see you're going to try to pump up
[52:50] something and do it you don't have to
[52:52] pump up nothing
[52:57] all right
[52:58] he didn't overcome or shall be clothed
[53:00] in white Raymond
[53:02] the righteousness of the Saints
[53:04] and I will not blot out his name why is
[53:07] it saying that
[53:10] because they got away from his name
[53:16] that totally lost the revelation of the
[53:18] name of Jesus
[53:20] they made him a part of a trinitarian
[53:22] Doctrine
[53:25] but he said okay
[53:30] he said because I remember
[53:32] that when I laid the foundation and you
[53:34] would get on down in another and then
[53:36] you see when I laid the foundation in
[53:37] you said I laid it on the apostles and
[53:40] Prophets
[53:42] you may not have it totally right but
[53:44] you're still there
[53:47] you watch it when he gets to the serpent
[53:49] six Church age and how did he puts the
[53:51] name right in the Cornerstone
[53:53] in them still trinitarians
[54:02] but think about it
[54:04] I'll confess his name oh he'll confess
[54:07] my name because I stood when I was good
[54:10] if it is you're going to stand on what
[54:12] somebody else said
[54:13] if we don't understand don't assist
[54:15] together what they said before us where
[54:17] are we
[54:18] that's why we're not against the
[54:19] Methodist the Baptist the Presbyterian
[54:21] Catholics whatever we're not against
[54:23] people
[54:26] we're against the systems this made them
[54:28] unbelievers in God's word
[54:32] we love the people but we don't
[54:37] love the doctrines
[54:42] you see where you could stay going to
[54:45] number six
[54:54] you got it
[54:57] this is number six
[54:59] and watch
[55:01] because thou has kept the word of my
[55:03] patience
[55:05] okay brags on him but listen to tape the
[55:07] other day where brought around and said
[55:08] God knows how to raise children in a
[55:10] church
[55:11] any preparations you know he said if we
[55:14] just listen to that we might learn how
[55:15] to do a lot of things
[55:19] you know sometimes you got to whip you
[55:22] to get you to line up
[55:25] right
[55:29] amen because thou has kept the word of
[55:31] my patience
[55:33] I will also keep thee from the hour of
[55:35] Temptation
[55:37] now what did Brother around say that
[55:38] meant he said he would keep them from
[55:41] going into the tribulation
[55:44] now that's you just go back and read the
[55:46] book you don't know it get it I'll be
[55:48] glad to get it for you
[55:52] which shall come upon all the world to
[55:54] try them that dwell upon the Earth
[55:56] behold I come quickly hold fast that
[55:58] which thou Hast that no man take thy
[56:01] crown
[56:03] now if they didn't have a crown why
[56:06] would it speak of somebody inability to
[56:08] take it from them
[56:10] with a crown being a revelation of of
[56:13] God's deity don't let nobody take that
[56:16] from you
[56:24] him that overcometh will I make a pillar
[56:27] in the temple of my God
[56:29] and he shall go no more out
[56:32] and I will ride upon him the name of my
[56:34] God
[56:35] and the name of the city of my God which
[56:37] is New Jerusalem which cometh down out
[56:40] of Heaven from my God and I will write
[56:42] upon him my new name that's not in the
[56:45] lady ocean Church age that is in number
[56:48] six Church age that it's speaking of a
[56:50] new name
[56:54] and you know when you enter the seventh
[56:55] Church age
[56:56] he has a new name
[56:59] the name of Jesus was restored
[57:05] starting in Azusa Street with the
[57:07] Oneness doctrine of Jesus only
[57:11] not after Azusa Street they were
[57:12] trinitarians at zeusa Street
[57:15] about 14 somewhere in there
[57:17] Seymour and all of those begin to preach
[57:20] on those things
[57:23] and here comes people bringing in the
[57:25] name of Jesus
[57:27] revelation
[57:29] but look
[57:31] don't let nobody take your crown away
[57:32] from you
[57:36] I admire somebody was stunt was funk
[57:42] I'd rather see spunk than see well
[57:44] obviously rather Dale I feel simple I
[57:47] just keep it simple
[57:49] I don't understand
[57:52] that
[57:54] there's very little difference between
[57:56] stupid and simple
[58:02] what do you think
[58:04] if you're voluntarily
[58:08] simple
[58:09] because you don't want to know the
[58:11] Revelation then you're stupid
[58:17] I'm too mean I'm sorry you don't need to
[58:19] vote you another preacher and a pastor
[58:21] that'll help you and love you
[58:25] but listen
[58:28] I'll make him a pillow
[58:29] in the temple of my God you know what
[58:31] your Prophet said that is read it in
[58:32] church
[58:34] he said he'd take him right back
[58:36] and put him in the foundation of the
[58:41] Apostles and Prophets
[58:48] now we're right back where we started
[58:50] right
[58:52] the first church age the apostles and
[58:55] Prophets building a foundation Apostle
[58:57] Christ Jesus Christ being the Chief
[58:58] Cornerstone now we're right back to what
[59:00] the prophet said
[59:01] the preceding age the age before
[59:05] that precedes that
[59:08] they get a revelation but then the next
[59:11] age gets that Revelation plus plus plus
[59:15] plus
[59:16] now we're right back
[59:20] to where we started
[59:25] that ought to be enough to prove the
[59:27] point I'm going to make in a minute
[59:31] about this
[59:34] that we went right back to the first
[59:36] church age
[59:39] he said well the uh the Methodist no
[59:42] they didn't get to go all the way back
[59:44] they got back farther than others did
[59:49] what you remember
[59:51] that revelation
[59:53] seeds you and I
[1:00:01] that Revelation precedes our age
[1:00:08] how much they understood
[1:00:11] was up to them
[1:00:13] but it was a revelation given unto him
[1:00:18] that's where your song books begin to
[1:00:20] Rewritten about the blood and the things
[1:00:22] and all of the things happening
[1:00:26] and there goes back to your works as we
[1:00:29] read on one of the other ages
[1:00:31] works is supposed to be your faith
[1:00:33] expressed
[1:00:37] but think about it
[1:00:41] in the sixth Church age
[1:00:44] you find the revelation
[1:00:46] of Jesus Christ coming back
[1:00:49] no not fully no no because it would be
[1:00:54] hard to bring
[1:00:57] in that age in time
[1:01:00] but to begin to talk about Jesus
[1:01:03] you remember what I said while ago
[1:01:04] that's what people thinks when we say
[1:01:06] that the revelation of Jesus was lost
[1:01:10] what do you mean they always called him
[1:01:13] Jesus
[1:01:15] well may I quote the prophet
[1:01:18] you can call him Jesus Jesus and worship
[1:01:24] the devil
[1:01:27] does that solve that problem
[1:01:29] I didn't write the book
[1:01:33] I just believe the book
[1:01:39] but look what it says go back to the
[1:01:40] foundation
[1:01:44] you know as they started back in a way
[1:01:46] to get back towards the foundation and
[1:01:48] that sixth Church age
[1:01:51] that's why it's called brotherly
[1:01:52] kindness
[1:01:54] right
[1:01:56] Philadelphia brotherly kindness
[1:02:00] is because
[1:02:02] they begin to see more about Jesus
[1:02:08] great revivals
[1:02:10] were back there in Luther and Wesleyan
[1:02:14] Presbyterian Baptist
[1:02:18] your great revivals was back in the time
[1:02:23] of the sixth Church age and then
[1:02:25] relating right on over into the seventh
[1:02:30] you see church I don't want to forget
[1:02:32] what they got I want what they got plus
[1:02:35] what he's going to be making known in
[1:02:36] this age
[1:02:38] right
[1:02:39] but now when we finish in a minute I'm
[1:02:41] going to go ahead and lay the bomb when
[1:02:43] we finish in a minute you're going to
[1:02:44] see that that first church age
[1:02:47] is going to get exactly what you get
[1:02:55] it's going to require a little
[1:02:57] thinking in it
[1:03:01] okay
[1:03:04] but you see it comes out to the name of
[1:03:07] my God
[1:03:08] in the name of the city of my God which
[1:03:10] is New Jerusalem
[1:03:14] was coming down out of heaven and I'll
[1:03:17] ride upon him my new name
[1:03:21] he said brother Dale you're not looking
[1:03:23] for a new night yeah
[1:03:27] but may I describe it this way
[1:03:31] death cannot be destroyed until the
[1:03:35] Resurrection comes you remember that
[1:03:37] Sunday
[1:03:39] when the Resurrection comes death is
[1:03:43] destroyed
[1:03:45] all right it means it's got to be
[1:03:47] destroyed in you and I
[1:03:50] spiritually speaking not physically
[1:03:54] but to bring them out of the ground
[1:03:58] so death's going to be destroyed
[1:04:02] all right
[1:04:06] and here's where he's at
[1:04:10] each age inherits
[1:04:13] what the preceding age had
[1:04:17] they don't just stand alone and put them
[1:04:19] out
[1:04:21] each one takes what the other has said
[1:04:25] let's look at your life
[1:04:30] this is the lady you'll see an age
[1:04:32] behold I stand at the door and knock
[1:04:39] If any man hear my voice
[1:04:41] and open the door
[1:04:43] I'll come in to him
[1:04:46] you know sup with him
[1:04:48] and he with me
[1:04:51] what a wonderful thing in this age
[1:04:58] remember the story of the painting
[1:05:02] that the man made the painting of Jesus
[1:05:03] coming to the door which you remember
[1:05:05] there was no latch on the outside of the
[1:05:08] painting
[1:05:09] and remember the critic said well you
[1:05:11] messed up there he said oh no sir he
[1:05:14] said I meant for it to be there
[1:05:15] he said yeah but you have no latch
[1:05:18] said the latches on the inside
[1:05:23] you've got to open the door
[1:05:26] you know if I'd have been that critic
[1:05:27] I'd have found me a 10 gallon hat I'd
[1:05:30] have crawled up under it and shoved it
[1:05:32] down and I wouldn't have never
[1:05:33] criticized nobody else
[1:05:36] you know
[1:05:38] right
[1:05:39] I won't charge you with that
[1:05:41] I'm just human
[1:05:43] but look
[1:05:47] can you take verse 20.
[1:05:51] can you take verse 20 and take it all
[1:05:53] the way back
[1:05:55] to the first church age
[1:06:02] go all the way back
[1:06:06] to partaking of the Tree of Life
[1:06:10] and come all the way down through the
[1:06:13] death can't hurt you
[1:06:18] come all the way through
[1:06:20] make your pillar a part of the
[1:06:22] revelation
[1:06:26] in the temple of God
[1:06:32] church this is one thing I thought
[1:06:35] and I'm sorry
[1:06:37] it's just in me
[1:06:39] we had a meeting down at Schoolhouse one
[1:06:41] time and this great man
[1:06:44] stood there and made statements and said
[1:06:47] Azusa Street was false
[1:06:51] Lutheran West for them didn't have
[1:06:53] nothing and Azusa Street was false
[1:06:56] I quoted brother Branham
[1:07:00] to the man standing there
[1:07:02] of many quotes that brought around and
[1:07:04] said the exact same holy ghost on the
[1:07:08] day of Pentecost is here now and it was
[1:07:10] there in Azusa Street
[1:07:13] and how that brother random said no
[1:07:15] Messenger to the age because the Holy
[1:07:17] Ghost came himself
[1:07:19] talking about Azusa Street
[1:07:22] you know what he done he came right here
[1:07:25] to this church
[1:07:27] and said the same thing
[1:07:31] that those people were false and didn't
[1:07:33] have nothing
[1:07:40] I'm sorry
[1:07:45] but if I can save your soul
[1:07:48] by being stern and hateful
[1:07:51] I'll take my chance on the front seat in
[1:07:53] hell
[1:07:54] for you
[1:07:57] and that you don't believe
[1:08:01] but listen
[1:08:03] can you go back there
[1:08:05] and come down through ever Church age
[1:08:07] and see it's the revelation of Jesus
[1:08:09] Christ just constantly building
[1:08:12] until you come to this age
[1:08:15] and look
[1:08:17] I stand at the door and knock
[1:08:20] all right
[1:08:21] but around him said that the message
[1:08:23] always went to that's why it says to the
[1:08:26] churches
[1:08:27] each age it says to the churches
[1:08:31] he said that's the false Vine and the
[1:08:33] True Vine it condemns the false Vine and
[1:08:36] praises the True Vine
[1:08:41] in each age
[1:08:43] and we come down to this age look where
[1:08:44] we're standing
[1:08:45] behold I stand at the door and knock
[1:08:48] If any man hear my voice and open the
[1:08:51] door I'll come into him and sup with him
[1:08:54] and he with me
[1:08:58] I made a statement Sunday that I wonder
[1:09:03] if you were listening
[1:09:09] somewhere you're listening because I'd
[1:09:10] make a statement
[1:09:12] and it was sound incorrect to you
[1:09:15] and that's all you got
[1:09:18] but why would brother Branham
[1:09:21] have you ever heard a preacher
[1:09:25] preach
[1:09:27] and he preached I don't know how many I
[1:09:29] know these two or three
[1:09:31] called doors and doors
[1:09:38] you know in that he says that there's
[1:09:40] placing in our hearts
[1:09:43] that we have closed
[1:09:49] I said we've got to open them up
[1:09:53] behold I stand at the door
[1:09:59] and knock
[1:10:02] I got this Pride over here
[1:10:05] I got this
[1:10:08] yeah
[1:10:10] see I love this message
[1:10:13] the God is wonderful but watch now to
[1:10:16] him that overcometh I will grant to sit
[1:10:18] with me
[1:10:19] in my Throne that doesn't say on because
[1:10:23] that puts you in a different category
[1:10:30] even as I also overcame and I'm sat down
[1:10:33] with my father in his strong
[1:10:38] now we went through
[1:10:40] in the message here just recently
[1:10:44] talking about that Christ is not sitting
[1:10:48] on his own throne
[1:10:51] he's sitting on who's strong
[1:10:55] the Father Strong the working of the
[1:10:57] holy spirit is going to pull it up
[1:10:58] brother number eight
[1:11:00] tonight Christ is not sitting on his own
[1:11:02] throne
[1:11:04] he's sitting on who's strong his father
[1:11:06] is strong
[1:11:07] he did overcome what shall sit with me
[1:11:09] on what's he my Throne as I have
[1:11:13] overcome and I'm sat down on my father's
[1:11:15] Throne isn't that marvelous
[1:11:19] and we have that great and Grand
[1:11:21] privilege of knowing that someday we'll
[1:11:24] be able to sit with him on his throne
[1:11:28] and he takes the Throne of David
[1:11:31] which is our two and we'll reign with
[1:11:34] him a thousand years on Earth
[1:11:39] and then through eternity
[1:11:43] now
[1:11:46] without the way that I've laid it out
[1:11:51] I want to ask you a simple question
[1:11:55] if his age is not
[1:11:57] stacking Revelation upon revelation
[1:12:00] the preceding you know and then the one
[1:12:03] we are
[1:12:04] passing on that revelation
[1:12:08] then is the end time bride going to be
[1:12:11] the only ones that will be sitting on
[1:12:13] the throne
[1:12:19] if you isolate the ages that's what
[1:12:21] you've got
[1:12:25] you would have this age only sitting
[1:12:30] in our own
[1:12:32] he's strong which is the Millennium
[1:12:34] right
[1:12:35] because that's the Father Strong
[1:12:38] remember
[1:12:40] climb up on my turn to sit down until I
[1:12:43] make your enemies your footstool till I
[1:12:45] destroy death till I bring all the pies
[1:12:49] are you listening
[1:12:52] look to the next one's questions and
[1:12:53] answers in 54.
[1:12:57] he isn't up on his throne now he's
[1:12:59] sitting on God's throne
[1:13:03] he that overcomes shall sit with me on
[1:13:05] my Throne as I have overcome and set on
[1:13:07] my father's throne now he's wanting to
[1:13:10] come back and where is his Earthly
[1:13:13] throne
[1:13:16] the Throne of David
[1:13:20] God said he'd give him the Throne of
[1:13:22] David in the millennium
[1:13:26] now
[1:13:30] and you'll see why that I believe as I
[1:13:33] do
[1:13:35] that in this age
[1:13:37] it must come to a bodily Redemption
[1:13:44] in this age must come to a bodily
[1:13:46] Redemption no other age had to face that
[1:13:51] they face death they face persecution
[1:13:53] they were killed they were sown asunder
[1:13:57] but none of them come to a change of the
[1:13:59] body
[1:14:01] so we're going to have to do that
[1:14:05] and remember whether it means anything
[1:14:07] to you or not
[1:14:09] but remember he comes in Three Sons now
[1:14:12] son of man Son of God Son of David
[1:14:18] and remember
[1:14:22] in the Mighty God unveiled before us go
[1:14:25] ahead and pull up number 10 the son of
[1:14:27] man back in the church revealed in human
[1:14:30] beings not Son of God but the son of man
[1:14:32] back in his church again
[1:14:39] unto I mean Son of God down Through the
[1:14:42] Ages
[1:14:43] there's a reason for that more than you
[1:14:45] think
[1:14:48] but he can't go from son of day a son of
[1:14:51] God
[1:14:52] the baptism of the Holy Ghost straight
[1:14:54] into the
[1:14:56] millennium
[1:15:00] that don't mean nothing to most of you
[1:15:02] especially preachers they just say hi
[1:15:04] Philly
[1:15:05] but you show me how it can be done
[1:15:09] but let him come back here and go to the
[1:15:12] unveiling of God he says son of man Son
[1:15:15] of God Son of Man son of David
[1:15:23] you say that's four names
[1:15:25] I'll give you about five in just a
[1:15:26] minute
[1:15:28] if you want to argue
[1:15:33] but you see that's worth it I've always
[1:15:35] believed it from 1969 when I preached
[1:15:38] his pride would be the son of man
[1:15:41] I believe then what I believe today
[1:15:44] that that baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:47] that was down through the ages in a
[1:15:49] wonderful position
[1:15:52] but yet it left Man Without a change of
[1:15:54] the body
[1:15:55] and the son of man must come back in the
[1:15:57] end time because the son of man is
[1:15:59] resurrection
[1:16:05] he said that the son of man have power
[1:16:07] to forgive sins
[1:16:09] I say unto thee take up your bed and
[1:16:12] walk
[1:16:15] brother random wooden be son of man
[1:16:18] he says it he said I'm a son of man that
[1:16:22] the son of man
[1:16:25] is to use
[1:16:30] what do you think about it
[1:16:33] back into church again
[1:16:35] as the son of man
[1:16:40] no leaven Among Us
[1:16:43] brings the fullness for the godhead
[1:16:45] bodily
[1:16:49] that's what your Prophet said
[1:16:53] where's it going to be
[1:16:57] revealing himself to son of man that
[1:17:00] concerns we would see Jesus 64. number
[1:17:03] 11.
[1:17:04] revealing himself in his church
[1:17:07] the human flesh
[1:17:09] making himself known
[1:17:12] you get it see God down here in his
[1:17:14] church making himself again the word
[1:17:18] the son of man being revealed in the
[1:17:20] last days as it was in the days of Sodom
[1:17:26] we know this statement that he's the
[1:17:28] beginning of the creation of God taken
[1:17:30] from proving his word paragraph 146 but
[1:17:33] he said this is the continuation of that
[1:17:35] creation of God
[1:17:38] and look what he said here
[1:17:42] number 13.
[1:17:44] the revelation of Revelations chapter 5
[1:17:47] 61.
[1:17:52] 6 18.
[1:17:56] now I want you to follow me real close
[1:17:58] then I'll try to quit
[1:18:01] as the son of David
[1:18:03] he's heir to the throne
[1:18:06] now here he brings in another you say
[1:18:08] well there's only three sons nine yeah
[1:18:10] but he has many many titles and
[1:18:13] connections to son
[1:18:15] as the son of Abraham
[1:18:18] he's heir to the Royal Grant
[1:18:21] that right
[1:18:22] he's there to the Royal Grant amen
[1:18:25] Palestine
[1:18:28] and all that's in her Abraham's seed
[1:18:32] he was the son of Abraham
[1:18:35] as son of man
[1:18:37] what does son of man
[1:18:40] what did man lose
[1:18:44] come on you can't tie that together with
[1:18:47] this is the revelation of the Redemption
[1:18:49] of the body where is he going to son of
[1:18:52] man what what did man lose
[1:18:57] he lost the Earth
[1:18:59] so as the son of man he's out to
[1:19:01] everything in the Earth
[1:19:04] all this he's got
[1:19:06] and he has to give it back to us
[1:19:11] then he's returning back
[1:19:13] as he was
[1:19:15] he's now then as the son of God
[1:19:20] he inherits all things
[1:19:27] the son of David he's
[1:19:28] a throne
[1:19:33] the son of Abraham he's heir to the
[1:19:35] Royal Grant
[1:19:38] as son of man he's heir to the Earth
[1:19:44] as Son of God he's heir to all things in
[1:19:48] heaven
[1:19:49] and Earth
[1:19:51] oh my
[1:19:52] that's Our Redeemer our Kinsmen Redeemer
[1:20:02] I'm honest
[1:20:04] when I first read dad I thought
[1:20:07] for one time brother Branham
[1:20:10] I don't agree with you
[1:20:16] what'd you think
[1:20:18] what are you sitting there thinking now
[1:20:20] when you've got all of these great
[1:20:21] grants and things that goes on the air
[1:20:23] to the Earth The Heirs of this the Earth
[1:20:26] of that why does it fall back to the son
[1:20:28] of God
[1:20:31] be in the air of all things
[1:20:37] you didn't thought that way
[1:20:45] Son of God is the heir of all things
[1:20:50] in other words there's the greatest
[1:20:52] Grant of all
[1:20:54] David Abraham
[1:20:57] son of man
[1:21:00] anything you bring
[1:21:02] in the Son of God he's heir to all
[1:21:05] things in heaven
[1:21:08] and Earth
[1:21:11] there would not be a son of David
[1:21:14] there would not be a son of Abraham
[1:21:18] it would not be a son of man
[1:21:24] and did not first been a son of God
[1:21:31] are you with me
[1:21:36] you remember I asked the question years
[1:21:38] ago and I know it offends you when I
[1:21:40] asked a question about son of man Son of
[1:21:43] God I said when do you think of Son of
[1:21:45] God and everybody was saying oh 2000
[1:21:48] years ago down there when he come
[1:21:50] I said you don't even follow your Bible
[1:21:52] I know it offended you and I'm sorry
[1:21:55] not for the truth
[1:21:57] I'm sorry that you got offended and I
[1:22:00] know a lot of you did
[1:22:07] but you see the Son of God was at first
[1:22:09] one that come out of God in the
[1:22:11] beginning that was the logos the Creator
[1:22:13] that's what your Prophet says do we stay
[1:22:15] all night
[1:22:18] quote what he says
[1:22:21] he said that Son of God was the word
[1:22:25] that created all things
[1:22:31] son of man went back there creating
[1:22:36] gentleman come on Earth and started this
[1:22:38] creating
[1:22:39] because he created you and I but who was
[1:22:42] that the Son of God in that son of man
[1:22:44] creating his own bridegroom
[1:22:48] don't never leave Son of God out of it
[1:22:50] make it where it's supposed to be
[1:22:52] all of those things that look great to
[1:22:55] be what we think we need this we need
[1:22:56] that we need to baptism of the Holy
[1:22:59] Ghost more than we need anything in the
[1:23:00] world
[1:23:02] and without the baptism of the Holy
[1:23:04] Ghost there ain't no need to worry about
[1:23:06] son of man Son of God Son of David I'm
[1:23:08] trying to who because we wind up being
[1:23:10] son of hell
[1:23:12] that'll be our judgment
[1:23:19] do you understand
[1:23:23] can you follow me then
[1:23:27] let's read over here in Revelations 3 21
[1:23:28] again
[1:23:30] I mean 21
[1:23:32] 7.
[1:23:37] go to six
[1:23:39] and he said unto me it is done
[1:23:42] I'm out for the Omega the beginning and
[1:23:44] the end
[1:23:45] I will give unto him that is the thirst
[1:23:48] of this fountain
[1:23:50] of the Water of Life freely
[1:23:54] he that overcometh
[1:23:56] shall inherit
[1:23:58] all things
[1:24:02] now watch him
[1:24:05] and I'll be his God
[1:24:11] and he shall be my son
[1:24:16] I got some quotes in here about adoption
[1:24:18] if you'd like to stay a while
[1:24:21] but you ought to understand
[1:24:25] Prophet even says God's waiting on you
[1:24:27] and I
[1:24:30] adoption time when he can for pour into
[1:24:33] his fullness
[1:24:38] and adopt these children
[1:24:43] Son of God is the adopter son of man is
[1:24:47] the individual part to be adopted when
[1:24:50] he walked on this Earth that son of man
[1:24:52] was the word made flesh that Son of God
[1:24:55] was in him
[1:24:57] oh it's a rising of the Sun
[1:25:00] but the man said who is this son of man
[1:25:02] he said in the beginning was the word
[1:25:03] the word was with God and the Word was
[1:25:06] God
[1:25:07] no no no no no no no no no that Son of
[1:25:09] God oh wonderful
[1:25:13] but just remember
[1:25:15] only by the new birth
[1:25:17] to you inherit anything
[1:25:22] now are we right
[1:25:25] so we started off the first church age
[1:25:29] with a new birth
[1:25:35] the second Church age had the newborn
[1:25:36] third fourth fifth sixth
[1:25:39] seventh
[1:25:42] that new birth is the son of God
[1:25:46] adoption brings you into talking of Son
[1:25:49] of Man
[1:25:54] will bring us to
[1:25:57] a bodily Redemption
[1:25:59] that's why she's got to be the fullness
[1:26:02] of the godhead bodily that's why she's
[1:26:04] got to be the son of man
[1:26:08] the word made flesh
[1:26:12] that's why she's going to speak and the
[1:26:15] dead will raise
[1:26:20] but you ain't going to leave
[1:26:22] Paul out of it
[1:26:24] because he had the Holy Ghost
[1:26:26] you ain't going to leave Luther Wesley
[1:26:28] anybody out of it because they had the
[1:26:30] Holy Ghost for their age they had the
[1:26:32] Son of God for their age
[1:26:34] the new birth
[1:26:38] we are just coming to a point
[1:26:41] to fulfill
[1:26:44] the bodily Redemption
[1:26:50] to make it to where we can stand in the
[1:26:52] millennium
[1:26:53] with him
[1:26:57] we're sitting here strong
[1:26:59] if we overcome and sit in the Father
[1:27:01] Strong the father strong is a baptism of
[1:27:04] the Holy Ghost right
[1:27:06] let's stand come on bro
[1:27:09] do you understand
[1:27:15] don't make each age just an isolated
[1:27:17] Affair of each one and a thought that
[1:27:19] comes from that age
[1:27:24] read each one of them and read your
[1:27:25] church age book and look how each one of
[1:27:28] them is related to the other
[1:27:33] because he
[1:27:36] that overcometh
[1:27:38] will inherit all things
[1:27:43] and I'll be his God
[1:27:47] and he'll be my son
[1:27:54] look what a wonderful thing it is to be
[1:27:55] a child of God
[1:27:58] what a wonderful point it is to be a
[1:28:00] Christian
[1:28:02] what a wonderful hour
[1:28:08] are leaving
[1:28:12] the end of all things the Bible said has
[1:28:14] come upon us
[1:28:18] what do you think is going to bring it
[1:28:21] according to my understanding
[1:28:24] that's what you can place it at I guess
[1:28:27] according to my understanding
[1:28:30] a move among the bride
[1:28:32] is to bring the World Church against us
[1:28:37] that's according to my understanding of
[1:28:39] what I read the prophet is being saying
[1:28:46] a move among the people
[1:28:50] there'll only be a move among those who
[1:28:52] know who they are and can see who they
[1:28:55] are
[1:28:58] that's right the others will never know
[1:28:59] the move is on
[1:29:03] you know when the prophet was singing
[1:29:05] that one day about the move is on he
[1:29:07] said that's thus saith the Lord
[1:29:10] it's on but you know what it only on for
[1:29:13] them it'll move
[1:29:15] what do we got brother
[1:29:17] we'll do that
[1:29:19] all right uh is that seven in there
[1:29:23] humidity anybody has a need the order is
[1:29:26] open
[1:29:27] think about that new birth
[1:29:30] is what makes you a child of God
[1:29:35] that new birth makes you a child of God
[1:29:39] all the other things are related to that
[1:29:42] new birth
[1:29:44] to bring
[1:29:46] you
[1:29:48] and God has won
[1:29:52] to walk off this Earth
[1:29:55] I hope you're listening at the end I
[1:29:57] didn't spend enough time but either
[1:29:59] overcometh in this age you'll sit with
[1:30:01] me in my Throne as I've overcome and sit
[1:30:03] with my father
[1:30:04] if we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:30:06] and said not New Birth then we can sit
[1:30:09] in a millennium with him
[1:30:10] you know what Luther will be there too
[1:30:15] all of those down through there was a
[1:30:17] new birth will be there why because one
[1:30:21] day they will inherit all things
[1:30:26] each age will inherit
[1:30:29] the age prior and the age after
[1:30:31] the best way to say it
[1:30:33] all before and all after Jesus Christ
[1:30:36] was saying yesterday today and forever
[1:30:38] we're going to hurt it
[1:30:40] don't forgive me about that
[1:30:48] anybody
[1:31:03] said the new birth is the most important
[1:31:07] thing in your life
[1:31:09] foreign
[1:31:52] that I needed something
[1:32:24] move on brother
[1:32:26] here's to what matters
[1:32:28] all right let's end this crack off a
[1:32:31] little bit all right father in the name
[1:32:34] of Jesus Christ we send this for our
[1:32:37] coffee to the back of our Lord about
[1:32:40] this stomach problem we pray it all will

[1:32:49] I don't know

[1:33:13] and to take with them
[1:33:15] and let's believe all is well father in
[1:33:20] the name of Jesus Christ we send his
[1:33:22] prayer cloth with our sister Lord and
[1:33:24] our brother and she'll take care of them

[1:33:29] not to just them but everybody with them
[1:33:30] we love you and we thank you in Jesus
[1:33:33] name

[1:33:43] that he'd hope that when he got to be 76
[1:33:46] that he had a heart like hers
[1:33:50] what thank God
[1:33:55] thank God
