[10:16] this day in your grace and your love
[10:18] Lord and we thank you for all things and
[10:20] we just commit them into your hands and
[10:22] we believe you that you'll take care of
[10:24] it we ask you to just be with brother
[10:26] dick bear Lord as he is going through
[10:29] this time and the problems that God and
[10:31] all that they've got to do this and got
[10:34] to do that so if they've got to do it
[10:36] then we just believe that you'll be
[10:38] there to take care of it because you're
[10:40] greater than all that they've got to do
[10:42] on during those your God and you change
[10:44] night we ask you to just reach down and
[10:47] touch our brother and let everything be
[10:48] alright we pray that you'd take that
[10:50] away Lord it
[10:51] don't even have to operate because we
[10:54] still got time for you to come on the
[10:56] scene
[10:56] and we asked you to just be with each
[10:58] one remember all the other sicknesses
[11:00] there's many many sicknesses among us
[11:02] and Lord just reach down and touch each
[11:04] one and let your loving grace be with us
[11:07] got each one we love you and we thank
[11:09] you have your way in Jesus name now I
[11:15] thought it had it finished up on that
[11:16] but we're gonna continue a little bit on
[11:20] to this thought and I wish you would
[11:22] read and study more and more on the
[11:26] future home alright and that you would
[11:30] read then and study keep your thoughts
[11:32] and read it down on revelations 21
[11:36] because revelation 21 you'll see it John
[11:40] says sees the bride coming and describes
[11:44] it he sees the city coming and describes
[11:48] it and you can't tell which one he's
[11:50] talking about because they're identical
[11:51] the city is made to our desires right
[11:56] our thoughts are not like that of what
[11:58] we desire and God said you know I mean
[12:01] the Prophet said that God would make it
[12:03] according to our desires so when he see
[12:06] the city you see the bride when you see
[12:09] the bride you see the city so that's
[12:11] what we want to you know keep our
[12:13] understanding into that line and do it
[12:17] and just let the the Lord have his way
[12:19] okay verse one revelation 21 and I saw a
[12:28] new heaven and a new earth for the first
[12:30] heaven and the first Earth were passed
[12:32] away and there was no more sea and I
[12:35] joined saw the holy city New Jerusalem
[12:37] coming down from God out of heaven
[12:39] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[12:41] husband see that's bright
[12:45] but it's this city in the same fire I
[12:49] see that I'm in the same sentence and I
[12:52] heard a voice out of heaven saying
[12:53] behold the tabernacle of God is with men
[12:55] and he will dwell with them and they
[12:57] shall be his people and God himself
[12:59] shall be with them and be their God and
[13:02] God shall wipe away all tears from their
[13:04] eyes
[13:05] I shall be no more death neither sorrow
[13:07] nor crying neither shall there be any
[13:10] more pain for the former things are
[13:13] passed away and heat it set up on the
[13:15] throne said behold I make all things new
[13:18] and he said unto me write for these
[13:21] words are true and faithful and he said
[13:25] unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega
[13:27] the beginning and the end I will give
[13:30] unto him that is athirst of the fountain
[13:31] of the water of life freely
[13:34] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[13:37] things now he's gonna make everything
[13:40] new and look what you get this is to the
[13:44] overcomer now remember how we taught it
[13:47] each overcomer in each church age gets
[13:52] what the other ages get right it's not
[13:58] that you got the first Church age you
[13:59] just get so much overcoming and the
[14:01] licen get a great big now each church
[14:04] age the overcomer inherits what precedes
[14:09] you know so now look so this is the
[14:11] overcoming to ever age now see how you
[14:15] can read that then to he that overcometh
[14:18] no matter what church age ease in what's
[14:21] he gonna do he's healing her at all
[14:22] things and I'll be his God and he shall
[14:25] be my son father just bless your word
[14:27] and your love unto us in Jesus name Amen
[14:31] you may be seated now keeping our
[14:36] thought because that's why I want you to
[14:41] read the future home over and over he
[14:45] said well I've read it well read it
[14:48] again because every time you read it
[14:51] you're gonna get more there'll be more
[14:54] and more understanding or listen to the
[14:55] tape and things because it'll it'll
[14:58] bring out these things and they'll bring
[15:00] out what I stopped talking about see
[15:03] when John describes the city he
[15:08] describes it like the bride we need to
[15:15] describe the bride he described it like
[15:17] a city
[15:19] you know because it's the it's the same
[15:22] as I said the Prophet said in the future
[15:25] whom he builds it according to our
[15:26] desires all right so whatever is there
[15:30] in this to do this that the other we may
[15:33] read a little bit of that later on and
[15:36] understanding but it's a beautiful
[15:38] picture now I want you to follow this
[15:42] thought women today and all because we
[15:45] just kind of pulled up a little bit of
[15:47] it there this past Sunday
[15:51] and speaking of it but we want to stay
[15:55] more or less more or less in our
[15:57] thoughts today on to the earth and
[16:03] holding that thought and then we'll move
[16:06] in let her into the message part to
[16:09] understand alright because I want you to
[16:12] understand we just read where he said I
[16:16] saw a new heaven and a new earth well
[16:21] because the first heaven first earth
[16:23] passed away now we know that it's not
[16:26] passed away like an ayah lady right
[16:29] that's why I want you to go into the
[16:30] future home and read it over it's not
[16:33] annihilate it I'll read you some in a
[16:35] minute of that it's not totally
[16:37] destroyed see we we always look at
[16:40] something like that you know when it
[16:41] says pass away well let's just blow it
[16:43] away well where we're going you know I
[16:48] mean if the world's blow it away while
[16:50] we're going we're going to Mars Venus
[16:51] Jupiter where we're going to yeah what I
[16:57] think most people do in their mind they
[17:01] can't comprehend eternity or something
[17:09] you know to be marvelous so they just
[17:13] want to try to keep it down here to
[17:15] simple and you know and they said well
[17:18] okay we'll just go off to another planet
[17:20] because the world blow it away well it's
[17:23] not blow it away it's not nothing it's
[17:28] not annihilated it's not blowed away
[17:32] it's just changing in one form to
[17:34] another our cleansing as far as Satan is
[17:40] to the earth and the things it'll be the
[17:43] cleansing of that and it'll be redeemed
[17:49] see we talked about Redemption but do we
[17:53] think about the world being redeemed now
[17:59] do we do we keep that in our thoughts me
[18:02] alright see then it's so beautiful when
[18:04] the Prophet would explain it as to how
[18:07] he said I I saw a new heaven and a new
[18:10] earth and he says on Satan's Eden we
[18:15] gave that that the first heaven will be
[18:18] the Millenium because heaven we're
[18:23] looking at heaven lock up the atmosphere
[18:25] of like over this or that or the other
[18:27] are great things or what you know
[18:29] looking at it as something like that
[18:32] instead of looking at it as as to what
[18:34] it's to be all right the millennial
[18:38] reign will be God ruling over earth all
[18:42] right now that's the best definition
[18:44] that you'll get for redemption if you'll
[18:48] think about it
[18:49] god ruling over earth alright see we was
[18:57] worried we think well we'll just go up
[18:58] into the heaven somewhere and we're
[19:01] gonna all play harps and float around
[19:03] and we're gonna have all this that in
[19:05] the other you know and we're gonna think
[19:09] about you know some kind of a deal that
[19:12] will it's beyond what we got here you
[19:14] know and it's a but yes it's think
[19:18] simple all right he's not going to
[19:22] annihilate the earth okay the first
[19:26] heaven proves that those the first
[19:29] heaven is the millennial reign the
[19:33] millennial reign will be one thousand
[19:36] years of time upon the earth to prove
[19:40] the sin curse is gone from the earth
[19:43] right now is that
[19:45] definition the profit gives for it he
[19:48] said it's the seventh day out of Eden
[19:50] thing and man is gonna live a thousand
[19:54] years somebody is won't matter about us
[19:57] code we're gonna be eternal but
[19:58] somebody's gonna live that well it's
[20:01] something for a prophet to come along
[20:02] and say that there'll be a healer and in
[20:04] the Millennium the God will raise up
[20:09] because somebody's gonna live a thousand
[20:11] years all right
[20:13] and if we're all eternal what does it
[20:16] got to do about a thousand years all
[20:19] right let's see the Millennium is heaven
[20:22] ruling over earth okay God is going to
[20:26] be sitting on the throne of David not a
[20:30] natural throne or things it's this
[20:34] terminologies and words that you use
[20:36] will you be sitting on the throne ruling
[20:41] the whole world as the son of David all
[20:46] right
[20:46] now see that's the millennial reign okay
[20:51] says then there'll be a new earth
[20:56] now watch what I'm talking about because
[20:59] see God Armageddon comes after it's ours
[21:03] at the end of the tribulation is the
[21:06] Armageddon all right
[21:08] Armageddon is just like Oh
[21:11] there'll be things in in the Millenium
[21:14] it won't be in the future home so
[21:16] there'll be things left over from from
[21:17] Armageddon if that's true Armageddon
[21:20] will leave things that is not totally
[21:23] annihilated because the Millenium will
[21:27] not be a city or something coming down
[21:32] and dwelling on a redeemed earth you got
[21:37] to wait one more stage I'm trying to get
[21:40] you the order of events to work that
[21:43] when you finish with it you'll have a
[21:45] beautiful plan of redemption in your
[21:48] understanding and you say well hey this
[21:51] father's this this follows this hey we
[21:54] got it in line all right we see the
[21:57] Millennium
[22:00] Satan is just bombed for a thousand
[22:05] years all right
[22:06] and there'll be things Arthur probably
[22:08] said it won't be in the future home so
[22:10] just take the Millennium then as heaven
[22:12] ruling over earth Satan bound to word
[22:17] that he cannot rule not a dilated now
[22:22] he's bound and he's bound at Armageddon
[22:28] by chain of circumstances brother run
[22:31] said he really at the point that he's
[22:33] doing how nobody to work through its so
[22:36] made ride until he don't have no like to
[22:38] work through he said it's not a log
[22:40] chain holding him or something
[22:42] all right sin dinars the Millennium
[22:46] Heaven ruling over earth for a thousand
[22:49] years all right cuz that's what he's
[22:52] saying he said what is the new heaven he
[22:55] said that would be the Millennium in
[22:57] what is the new earth see the new earth
[23:00] wants the millennium takes place you
[23:03] still got a problem because you've got a
[23:06] lot of things that needs to be destroyed
[23:09] alright then you have gog and magog
[23:12] to come and that will be a total
[23:16] annihilation of all demons all stuff
[23:21] like that everything Satan is not just
[23:23] bang he's destroyed everything is
[23:27] destroyed that it is not of God at gog
[23:30] and magog alright and see then you come
[23:33] forth within you earth in other words
[23:35] you can take the millenium coming into
[23:38] Armageddon you can see that there will
[23:41] be a lot of nuclear destruction probably
[23:43] because once they start shooting off
[23:45] bombs or anybody does everybody else
[23:47] gonna start pushing buttons too and then
[23:50] it's gonna be a nuclear destruction but
[23:53] gog and magog won't be a nuclear
[23:54] destruction
[23:56] that'll be God destroying even destroyed
[24:01] all demons never they and you come forth
[24:05] with a new earth not a different earth
[24:11] not another or
[24:12] instead of this one would you come forth
[24:15] with a redeemed er er then the city
[24:19] comes down now you get to get the
[24:23] layouts yeah I'm trying to make you
[24:25] follow the layout in your mind yeah the
[24:29] new city don't come down in the
[24:30] Millennium now you got a thousand years
[24:35] of earthly reign of God ruling over
[24:37] earth
[24:38] we'll be there with him ruling and
[24:41] reigning for a thousand years
[24:42] all right then at the end of that
[24:45] thousand year Satan is loosed and it
[24:48] goes forth and he'll be a time tired and
[24:50] all kind of problems can take place but
[24:53] then there'll be a gog and magog which
[24:57] will be destroying all demons all things
[25:00] all people that are not right everything
[25:03] that's you know no sin can go there but
[25:08] it'll start with Armageddon
[25:12] yeah not being a total annihilation
[25:16] the Gog and Magog view into the demons
[25:18] being destroyed now I want you to get
[25:20] that and hold that in your mind see then
[25:23] you can separate Armageddon from Gog and
[25:25] Magog because you got the two battles
[25:27] during the Book of Revelations all right
[25:30] and seized it but when gog and magog
[25:33] comes it'll burn off hold the whole
[25:37] earth and God will redeem it he doesn't
[25:41] written down listen to the word he
[25:43] doesn't redeem it at the Millennium he
[25:46] just uses it but he will redeem this
[25:50] earth through Gog and Magog will redeem
[25:55] and he'll come forth with a redeemed
[25:58] entire earth then the city can come down
[26:04] see so we're tied up somewhere you know
[26:08] we don't have no you know we're not
[26:10] after battling I've heard that the
[26:12] people of the message you don't
[26:14] preachers old one heard the Millenium
[26:16] we're gonna come riding back with him on
[26:19] white horses and we're just gonna fight
[26:21] and we're gonna kill and we're gonna
[26:26] you're in a glorified body it's the rest
[26:32] of them in glorified bodies no no no
[26:34] we're gonna kill them what are you gonna
[26:36] kill them with what are you gonna do all
[26:37] you gotta do speak it they but that's
[26:41] where these people get their ideas and
[26:43] they want to make some thought just
[26:45] solve the problem go step by step of
[26:52] what the Prophet says and then you got
[26:56] it done next thing is the rapture order
[27:01] of events right next things around after
[27:05] that the two witnesses in your
[27:08] tribulation period for three and a half
[27:09] years then you've got Armageddon coming
[27:13] right at the end of that threat I hear
[27:16] tribulation then you got what then
[27:20] you're going to step by step you go into
[27:24] the Millennium from Armageddon into the
[27:27] millennium and then from the Millennium
[27:29] that you go to the next stage and you'll
[27:32] go and you'll have Gog and Magog and
[27:35] then you'll have the future home the
[27:40] last thing is - future home coming down
[27:42] it's not the redemption of the earth the
[27:46] redeeming of the earth is Armageddon
[27:52] then you have the future home coming
[27:55] down on a redeemed earth well go get
[27:59] Matt you you put them together I'm again
[28:02] first call you may call second okay
[28:05] and you you wind up with a beautiful
[28:08] picture of the plan of redemption
[28:12] because by the time you reach that
[28:14] future home brother Brendan said ain't
[28:18] no more sin he said ain't no death I'm
[28:22] distraught he's on the side of my Bible
[28:23] as I hear him say it he said there's no
[28:26] more death no more sorrow the scripture
[28:28] says no thought but the city is cut the
[28:32] lysed is the city
[28:37] in the prior to Armageddon you have a
[28:44] Millennium temple or right after you
[28:48] have a Millennium temple to be erected
[28:50] on earth for the Millennium that's what
[28:53] your prophet said it gives you the
[28:55] scripture everything all right let's see
[28:59] then there is no temple we're gonna read
[29:03] that and study those stars there's no
[29:05] temple in the future home
[29:08] God is the temple but I want you to see
[29:13] the plan of redemption no that's that's
[29:16] where I love it when brother Branham
[29:18] goes into the future home he's gonna try
[29:21] to describe a city you read it and
[29:23] you'll you get it he's gonna try to
[29:25] describe a city that he sees coming down
[29:28] from John in it he automatically gets
[29:31] into justification sanctification
[29:33] baptism on the holding of what happens
[29:36] in the days of Noah what happened in the
[29:38] days of the Lord Jesus what happens over
[29:41] here in a fiery baptism he's trying to
[29:44] explain it and when he does he said if
[29:47] you don't get nothing else get the plan
[29:48] of redemption because that's what he was
[29:51] explaining the plan of redemption to us
[29:55] to where we can understand alright so
[29:58] then remember one thing if you want to
[30:02] go to it you can go to they can pull it
[30:05] up if they want to number two but it's
[30:07] in the future home it's not destroying
[30:10] the world it's destroying sin it's not
[30:17] annihilated right
[30:21] he gives the big word for it he said and
[30:24] he covers that you know what that word
[30:27] means it means to pass away now you
[30:32] should have studied the message enough
[30:34] those out on the internet go to the
[30:36] future home read the future home and see
[30:40] what the Prophet was saying it's a
[30:44] beautiful story of redemption giving you
[30:48] each step each stage of the journey
[30:51] of redemption he said well as the World
[30:54] Cup everyday why not see that's that's
[31:01] what's always tore me up is it's all
[31:03] when you're looking at something the
[31:06] Prophet is trying to explain and he's
[31:09] explaining Redemption why do you want to
[31:11] redeem something just a little bit you
[31:15] know what I mean why do you want to just
[31:18] whitewash it why not say Regained
[31:27] why not believe in Redemption and that
[31:32] the redemption would be something made
[31:36] new and that's why covers in Revelation
[31:42] by chapter 21 he said all things are
[31:46] made new well what I believe is it we're
[31:53] just gonna go along here and it's gonna
[31:55] wipe all this off and then it's gonna
[31:57] just turn around start back over an old
[31:59] world again you know what's wrong with
[32:02] you you don't have enough faith to
[32:05] believe that God can take care of all of
[32:08] it so you want to make sure to keep just
[32:11] a little bit just in case you don't make
[32:13] it that you can drop in the ground and
[32:16] holler and scream about the earth or
[32:18] something you understand what I'm sayin
[32:24] the Prophet said the word redeemed is
[32:28] what take you back to where you come
[32:33] from is that redeem all right the world
[32:38] came into existence one day right it was
[32:44] created okay it's to be redeemed
[32:51] then the city comes down after the
[32:55] redeeming of the earth see the world is
[33:01] going to be cleansed off do away with
[33:04] seeing doing
[33:04] and come forth not just a Garden of Eden
[33:09] to your you want it to just be turned
[33:15] back to a Garden of Eden style now I
[33:20] know I'm touching on some easy feelings
[33:24] so I like to touch them just a little
[33:26] bit why do you not believe in a
[33:31] redeeming to make something eternal why
[33:36] do you want to just redeem it back to a
[33:38] Garden of Eden situation
[33:50] are you listening do you want do your
[33:55] votes your soul redeemed but I want it
[33:58] just a little bit enough left until I
[34:01] can see in just a tad and still be
[34:05] alright do you want to hold on to
[34:12] yourself so much do you want just a
[34:14] little bit of the old person left
[34:24] that's easy feelings because you see I
[34:28] know the human being and I know how we
[34:29] think why not believe in Satan being
[34:37] annihilated out of your soul oh yeah I
[34:44] believe that brother Dale but well I
[34:46] I've just got my own thoughts now this
[34:49] is just my thoughts I like that you know
[34:52] right real quick you're gonna get some
[34:54] garbage come on you know right real
[35:00] quick when you start saying you see my
[35:01] thoughts I don't care where it's you or
[35:03] me or who it is when we come to our
[35:04] thoughts it's garbage can cuz that's the
[35:07] garbage can it comes out of are you
[35:11] getting the point I've been thinking on
[35:14] this all week of try to express
[35:16] something to get you to see do we
[35:22] believe in Redemption or do we believe
[35:26] in just enough cleansing until it can
[35:29] become good head of no man years ago and
[35:39] I tried to talk to it the end brother
[35:41] motorboat did they got a little thing a
[35:46] little doctoring going some of you may
[35:50] have heard of it
[35:51] and they were talking about babies being
[35:54] born in the Millennium
[36:00] I know the quote brother run said it
[36:05] looked like they will it looked like it
[36:07] won't but I just asked one simple
[36:14] question because that's what I asked the
[36:18] man I thought the bride by the time the
[36:24] millennium comes was to be in a full
[36:28] glorified body body spirit and soul to
[36:34] be made eternal now is that your
[36:37] thoughts of redemption or do you think
[36:40] you just got a little bit redeemed now
[36:45] come on I'm sorry - be nice T and
[36:47] hateful but what I saw was an old man an
[36:53] old man in his 70s thinking we don't
[37:00] have babies in the Millennium I didn't
[37:06] have to have discernment to read his
[37:07] mind yet and I'll move on I knew what he
[37:12] was taking a glorified body when sex was
[37:26] the original sin and you know what I
[37:27] mean the attribute see he had in his
[37:34] mind
[37:40] the hemming II did that exposed today
[37:46] come on that's not Redemption he said
[37:52] well we'll have probably said he didn't
[37:54] know I ain't telling you what's right
[37:56] I'm telling you what can't be you can't
[37:59] have sex and the glorified body because
[38:05] there's nothing to have it with sorry
[38:08] I'm playing but it's too tight I've got
[38:12] to say it like it is
[38:14] and then you turn around and say well I
[38:16] think it fits the way well go with your
[38:19] thoughts because I listen to people
[38:24] they're talking well I think that you
[38:26] know we could do what do you think you
[38:28] think with this world here we're gonna
[38:30] wipe it off we're gonna totally
[38:31] annihilate it we're gonna go to Mars
[38:33] when we're going to Mars far Jupiter
[38:38] what are you doing why don't you do what
[38:43] your mom was doing because that's what
[38:45] your prophet was doing when he preached
[38:49] the future home you're not listening
[38:51] even to the title of the message how
[38:57] many of you even know the title of the
[38:59] message what if you're old it's the
[39:08] future home of the heavenly bridegroom
[39:13] and the earthly bride
[39:24] because once it's redeems you and I no
[39:26] problem to listen what are you talking
[39:31] about then the millennium will be a
[39:36] great cleansing Armageddon will be a
[39:39] great cleansing for the millennium to
[39:41] take place but it'll be things dire that
[39:45] won't be in the future home later on the
[39:50] Satan will be bound for a thousand years
[39:53] where he cannot tempt anybody or do
[39:55] anything wrong in that thousand years
[39:58] but then he'll be loosed no Bible says
[40:02] he'd go forward to see the nation's the
[40:04] Prophet said he brings him up Gog and
[40:07] Magog one time he says he loses them to
[40:12] raise their he right to bring forth in
[40:16] other words in a resurrection has to
[40:18] come up I don't understand all that
[40:21] don't climb - I'm just trying to tell
[40:23] you the truth of what I do see a future
[40:28] home then we're about to City till we
[40:32] get the earth redeemed city can come
[40:39] down on earth is not redeemed it can't
[40:44] come on a time element world of
[40:47] situations are still bad thing if it's
[40:50] redeemed it's made eternal this world is
[40:57] to be made eternal well that's worth a
[41:00] week we made eternal but the world okay
[41:02] I just don't believe it's enough yeah
[41:04] you don't believe God is enough to take
[41:05] care of it why don't you say what you're
[41:08] talking about
[41:10] you don't believe enough in Redemption
[41:12] to be able to make the world eternal why
[41:15] not because if the world can't be made
[41:18] eternal your body can't be made eternal
[41:21] oh come on
[41:23] may I quote brother Branham you know as
[41:27] the Lord Jesus his body was not eternal
[41:30] and had to be redeemed or made eternal
[41:34] at the resurrection and the change
[41:37] not that he was sinful and no part of
[41:40] that but it was the fact that he had a
[41:42] beginning anything at the beginning has
[41:44] to have an ending to it right so the
[41:49] world had a beginning it has to have an
[41:52] ending to that part of it that existed
[41:54] under and used of sin by the devil but
[42:01] it will come forth into an eternal age
[42:04] what don't you want to believe in
[42:06] eternal age why would you not want to
[42:13] believe in eternity like that why would
[42:18] you not want to believe in an eighth day
[42:21] of eternal life no types and shadows no
[42:26] more it comes forth eternal we don't
[42:31] think I got a right to believe you got a
[42:32] right to believe what you want to but
[42:34] just remember when you speak to me I'm
[42:36] gonna speak back to eating tater I don't
[42:37] believe it
[42:38] sorry for that now because I'm me you're
[42:42] telling me what you believe so allow me
[42:45] to write to say I don't believe it then
[42:47] you say why then I'll be glad to show
[42:48] you well because you see getting the
[42:53] stage correctly you get them a
[42:56] millennium and then you get gog and
[42:59] magog and the world is made eternal then
[43:06] the city comes down upon an entire
[43:10] redeemed earth your prophet said in the
[43:12] future home why because there was the
[43:15] Lord Jesus standing on the River Jordan
[43:20] down come God own to a redeemed earth
[43:24] and What did he say he said from this
[43:27] part of the earth I have redeemed and
[43:29] from that part of the earth which was
[43:31] the body of the Lord Jesus he said I
[43:33] will retain the rest of it in the
[43:39] resurrection his body was made eternal
[43:42] well the world has to reach it reach
[43:44] that stage that's why we preached so
[43:47] hard about it because this message is
[43:49] the message to
[43:50] bring the body to it a change not
[43:53] anihilation as our bodies we're bringing
[43:55] it to a change that our body can be made
[43:58] eternal our soul is eternal by the new
[44:01] birth we're waiting the redemption of
[44:04] the spirit and body you know the earth
[44:14] will be redeemed and become a new
[44:18] creation the earth will be redeemed and
[44:25] become a new creation a new creation is
[44:29] not the old creation made over it's a
[44:33] new creation okay not destroyed but made
[44:40] new are regained are made eternal are do
[44:51] you follow me
[44:53] where'd you believe it or not I'm asking
[44:56] you do you understand what I'm talking
[44:57] about then that way it goes to God to
[45:00] reveal it that's not up to me
[45:04] uh-huh so then his body was regained at
[45:10] the resurrection I remember now his body
[45:16] was not regained right there on the
[45:18] river Jordan you know it wasn't made
[45:22] eternal right there he had a body that
[45:24] had to go on and die but it was done as
[45:28] far as God was concerned far as God is
[45:32] concerned this whole world's already
[45:34] redeemed but he's gotta wait until the
[45:37] time of that right see
[45:46] the new city yeah I dare to say in our
[45:53] minds that we think a lot of times and
[45:58] how much did we confuse it with the
[46:01] future home see the future home is not
[46:06] the world the future home is the city
[46:10] that comes down on the world
[46:16] there's the world's regained its mighty
[46:18] eternal with the future home is really
[46:21] the city that comes down the future home
[46:23] is the dwelling place of the bride of
[46:26] Jesus Christ with her husband
[46:27] it's your home made if the prophet said
[46:31] according to your desires see him any
[46:38] thought about it well I think the future
[46:41] home is a new world and you know go get
[46:43] that laid out and write the scriptures
[46:45] right you got a millennial reign it's
[46:49] even study that if you'd look at it I
[46:51] saw a new heaven and a new earth yeah I
[46:56] know you don't think like I be enough
[46:58] I'm glad the whole world own thing like
[47:00] I do but I think that's in reverse order
[47:02] to what it ordered me but it can't be to
[47:06] be worse right yeah my mind says that
[47:11] ought to be I saw a new earth and a new
[47:16] heaven
[47:22] does your mind think matter what but it
[47:25] can't be the Bible is perfectly right
[47:28] it's a new heaven and new earth because
[47:30] the millennium has got to come before
[47:33] they can be a new earth because the
[47:36] millennium is here in time right so the
[47:39] Bible's are perfectly right it just
[47:42] doesn't fit our human terminologies
[47:44] because the first heaven the first earth
[47:48] is passed away the millennium one day
[47:53] will be passed away this old natural
[47:58] earth will go through a Redemption form
[48:02] to be rejuvenated read that in the
[48:08] future home notice how much time is he
[48:11] spends on it I ask you to just read come
[48:17] to me I'm not forgetting see the new
[48:27] city will descend upon a new earth and
[48:36] the city will be the future home of the
[48:41] heavenly bridegroom and what used to be
[48:45] the earthly bride because we're all
[48:51] earthly but when we're redeemed we won't
[48:58] be earthly bride anymore but you got to
[49:01] start from our earthly bride
[49:11] a new creation not the old creation made
[49:19] new it's a new creation the CD will come
[49:29] down a poem the redeemed earth the city
[49:37] will come down upon the redeemed earth
[49:44] and it's not that he's gonna come down
[49:47] here and I mean we ain't got to go over
[49:49] the Artic in the Millennium just want
[49:51] his things I millenniums not in the
[49:52] future in the Millennium you can they
[49:54] could be building houses and doing this
[49:56] and doing happen do it but your future
[49:58] home won't be nothing built by mankind
[50:00] you'll never be built every bit of it
[50:02] will be built by God himself
[50:08] I read real careful when I'm reading I
[50:15] noticed brother branham explaining
[50:17] something he's talking about those kings
[50:19] of the earth he said they bring their
[50:21] honor and glory into the city and he
[50:25] first uses the word tall or works then
[50:29] he switches it real quick and I'm
[50:32] watching that because I know what he's
[50:33] his point he was thinking like all the
[50:36] rest of us but when it finished there
[50:40] won't be no toil and labor in the future
[50:43] home there won't be no house building in
[50:48] the future home you have things in the
[50:51] Millenium you don't have there'll be a
[50:53] temple built in the Millennium but there
[50:58] won't be no temple in the future home
[51:02] because God is the temple the lamb is
[51:05] the temple hmm see the new city will
[51:11] come down upon a redeemed entire earth
[51:19] because that's exactly what happened
[51:22] when the Lord Jesus were standing there
[51:25] and down come the redemptive plan this
[51:32] part of the earth I've redeemed and from
[51:36] this part of the earth I'll redeem the
[51:38] rest of it okay remember the world our
[51:49] earth excuse me
[51:51] using the word earth his first may do
[51:57] and then the city will come down the
[52:06] earth has to be made new example of that
[52:13] is the fact of what will take place in
[52:17] the millennium I said a type example to
[52:24] take place in the millennium called in
[52:26] the Millennium God will be ruling over
[52:29] earth then when the earth is made new
[52:38] are redeemed the city can come down now
[52:46] don't get tied up in your thoughts keep
[52:48] it straight we come riding back in the
[52:51] millennium as the anointing to the
[52:53] temple but now we don't come riding back
[52:55] into future home we are the one that's
[52:58] riding back we are the one that's
[53:00] descending right
[53:09] in the millennial reign the earth will
[53:15] be going through the plan of redemption
[53:21] another earth because it was washed in
[53:25] the days of Noah right justification it
[53:35] was cleanse in the blood of Jesus Christ
[53:37] drop it on it to cleanse it and claim it
[53:40] but it's got to have a fiery baptism the
[53:47] earth is not redeemed in the Millennium
[53:50] it's in the process of redemption it's
[53:53] still under a seven time is still in the
[53:57] Millennium but it'll get a fiery baptism
[54:02] which is gog and magog then the city can
[54:11] come down now what will pop dropped back
[54:20] to this next Sunday but I want you to
[54:22] get a point now the bride will be able
[54:32] to live in the city code is her home
[54:38] he's her house he's her place that God
[54:42] is nice for her she'll be able to sit
[54:47] here in the Millennium with him on the
[54:49] throne but she won't be in her home just
[54:54] to wait until God can make all cleanses
[54:59] at all then she can come forth her home
[55:03] can come her real home can come she's
[55:07] just done the honeymoon in the
[55:08] Millennium that you were to your prophet
[55:16] see the kings of the earth the Prophet
[55:19] said and the others will not be able to
[55:23] live in the city now let's raise up
[55:30] we'll drop back and review this later
[55:31] but I want this point and you thought
[55:33] because well we're talking about that
[55:37] that earth when it's fully redeemed then
[55:43] the city can come down you say well I
[55:48] just don't believe a world we made
[55:49] eternal why not why would you not want
[55:52] to believe this made eternal that's what
[55:55] I'm saying
[55:58] you said what I just don't believe it to
[56:01] be made eternal I just got my idea your
[56:05] idea is showing that you don't believe
[56:08] in Redemption you believe in partial
[56:11] Redemption and you're holding on to some
[56:15] sinful act of human humanity to try to
[56:19] justify our thinking sorry would you
[56:26] tell me if I'm wrong why would you not
[56:30] want an eternal world why would you not
[56:38] want the earth to be made eternal if
[56:40] your body spirit and soul is eternal
[56:46] maybe you don't believe your body spirit
[56:49] and soul can be
[56:58] see why is it that the kings of the
[57:00] earth they can bring their glory and
[57:04] honor according to revelations 21 22
[57:07] through 27
[57:14] well is it to take ain't stay cuz it's
[57:22] not their home

[59:47] revelation it's 21 go ahead
[1:00:01] and I saw no temple their own Darian
[1:00:04] scuse me
[1:00:05] well the Lord God Almighty and the lamb
[1:00:07] are the temple of the earth and the city
[1:00:09] had no need of the Sun neither of the
[1:00:12] moon to shine in it for the glory of God
[1:00:15] will lighten it and the lamb is a lot
[1:00:18] thereof and the nations of them which
[1:00:21] are saved the town of future home comes
[1:00:29] everything saved will be saved you done
[1:00:32] went through between the millennium and
[1:00:35] and Gog and Magog you got a white throne
[1:00:40] judgment and everything settled so over
[1:00:43] the time you come to the future home and
[1:00:45] the city coming down everything's gonna
[1:00:47] be saved is saved saved means saved from
[1:00:51] where you was going
[1:00:52] it doesn't mean born again it doesn't
[1:00:55] mean those things I'll read you the
[1:00:57] quote from the Prophet the minute and
[1:01:00] the city had no need of the Sun neither
[1:01:02] the moon to shine there for the glory of
[1:01:04] God did lighten it and the lamb is like
[1:01:06] thereof and the nations of them which
[1:01:08] are saved shall walk in the light of it
[1:01:12] they get to walk in the light of the
[1:01:14] city
[1:01:14] they'll get to walk in the city but just
[1:01:17] have to go out and the kings of the
[1:01:19] earth do bring their glory and honor
[1:01:21] into it the gates of it shall not be
[1:01:23] shut you know oh by day or there shall
[1:01:28] be no night there and they shall bring
[1:01:32] the glory and honor of the nation's into
[1:01:36] it I like when you get on over there in
[1:01:40] a little bit and you're talking about
[1:01:42] the Tree of Life and how that is growing
[1:01:44] you ever noticed the Tree of Life over
[1:01:47] in the Book of Revelations
[1:01:49] the bride can eat the fruit but
[1:01:55] everybody else gets the leaves they
[1:01:58] don't get the fruit that's the Bible now
[1:02:01] I love that we get to fruit
[1:02:06] they get to leave
[1:02:11] can be saved from their sins safe from
[1:02:13] destruction safe from being lost but
[1:02:16] they're not saved like the bride I'll
[1:02:25] get to that in a minute but why thank
[1:02:29] you near mine
[1:02:33] why does a bride get to stay in the city
[1:02:39] number one is she's part of the city
[1:02:44] why because according to second
[1:02:51] Corinthians 5:17 all things are to be
[1:02:58] become new
[1:03:00] now that's like it says in Revelation
[1:03:06] it'll all be made new Galatians says
[1:03:14] none of these things of health much but
[1:03:17] a new creation does a new creation a new
[1:03:26] creature in Christ Jesus
[1:03:30] the born-again Christian is a new
[1:03:33] creature in Christ Jesus right that we
[1:03:37] need to go through all of that for you
[1:03:38] to understand the new birth makes you a
[1:03:41] new creature why is it this age never
[1:03:45] you don't play don't tension to those
[1:03:47] for the message to this age it said he's
[1:03:49] the beginning of the creation of God and
[1:03:51] brother Branham says we are the rest of
[1:03:53] that creation the beginning of the
[1:03:57] creation of God was God in human flesh
[1:03:59] up on earth through the wound of a
[1:04:01] Virgin Mary
[1:04:03] that's according to your prophet and you
[1:04:07] and I are the rest of that creation are
[1:04:09] the continuation of that creation and by
[1:04:16] the time we get to there
[1:04:17] we'll have bodies like unto his glorious
[1:04:19] body to the future home
[1:04:24] a new creature a new creation the cities
[1:04:33] built according to your desires because
[1:04:38] you a new creature you have a right to
[1:04:41] stay in that city but nobody else can't
[1:04:45] stay in it they say well what about see
[1:04:47] if jump over no terribly it what about
[1:04:50] 144,000 they're servants or eunuchs to
[1:04:53] the bride no matter where you put them
[1:04:54] they're in the millennial reign I have
[1:04:57] found no statement that I know of that
[1:05:00] wrote around them covers this own say
[1:05:02] the future home were doing this ideal if
[1:05:04] you find it I'd love to find it but I
[1:05:05] know one thing for sure if they're
[1:05:07] eunuchs to the bride and have eternal
[1:05:09] life in the millennial reign and rules
[1:05:11] are I mean to our dire to be servants
[1:05:14] for the bride then they'll still be
[1:05:16] servants because they're not gonna be
[1:05:17] made children of God see the future home
[1:05:21] is made for the children of God God's
[1:05:24] own offspring foolish virgins are not
[1:05:29] God's offspring they're impartation of
[1:05:34] eternal life given unto him they're not
[1:05:39] part of the body of Christ see the body
[1:05:41] of Christ is that little bride and she
[1:05:46] exactly fits the city the city exactly
[1:05:52] fits her John could describe the city
[1:05:56] and talk about the bride he could
[1:05:57] describe the bride I'm about to see if
[1:05:59] he could just go either way it didn't
[1:06:01] bother him because he knew what it meant
[1:06:03] but what does it mean to you what about
[1:06:10] it
[1:06:14] the everybody else can't stay in that
[1:06:16] city because they're not part of it
[1:06:20] they're not his children well if you're
[1:06:25] given eternal life that makes you a
[1:06:26] child of God I had more understanding of
[1:06:29] that in the Baptist Church now I'm sorry
[1:06:31] because we taught in the Baptist Church
[1:06:34] that there was foolish virgins that
[1:06:37] didn't get eternal life the way the
[1:06:38] bride got eternal life we taught that
[1:06:41] enough then how much more is it now an
[1:06:47] impartation is different from a birth
[1:06:50] your bride is a born-again Christian
[1:06:54] going through justification
[1:06:56] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:06:58] Ghost the closest your foolish virgins
[1:07:01] could go would be sanctification and
[1:07:04] they'd be left like I was saying I want
[1:07:06] to go the world in the days of Noah was
[1:07:09] wash as justification the days of Jesus
[1:07:12] was sanctification then it gets a fiery
[1:07:15] baptism one day Holy Ghost and fire the
[1:07:19] Bible calls him what about it
[1:07:26] I'm asking you to just listen and think
[1:07:31] the bride is the only one that can stay
[1:07:34] in the city why because it's her home by
[1:07:46] then she will be totally eternal body
[1:07:50] spirit and soul you'd have to agree to
[1:07:51] that you don't have to wait till fiery
[1:07:56] baptism come on I'm in the future home
[1:07:58] what I'm asking you believe it if you
[1:08:01] didn't go to go read it at least you
[1:08:03] could believe what said the Prophet
[1:08:04] covers in the future home that we are
[1:08:08] ahead of the world right you remember
[1:08:14] that the world is still in the days of
[1:08:17] the best it could be would be in the
[1:08:19] days of the blood of Jesus Christ it
[1:08:21] hasn't had a fiery baptism yet but you
[1:08:25] and I have already went through
[1:08:26] justification sang
[1:08:27] vacations and the baptism of the Holy
[1:08:29] Ghost given us eternal life in her soul
[1:08:33] by the time we reach the future home
[1:08:36] will be eternal embody no if not if you
[1:08:40] don't believe it that way what would be
[1:08:42] your purpose of going you want to move
[1:08:44] to another planet what I think we just
[1:08:46] go to another planet and start over yeah
[1:08:48] that's what I'm telling you you don't
[1:08:50] like me to be that plain you still have
[1:08:53] that lust spark then you take that and
[1:08:59] do what you won't do it I'm human but
[1:09:01] I'm your pastor these children
[1:09:04] understand terminologies I thought we
[1:09:08] believed in teaching our children right
[1:09:10] to stay away from the world and the
[1:09:12] things of the world but I don't want you
[1:09:16] to using bad words brother I ain't used
[1:09:18] a bad word yet I've used some
[1:09:22] terminologies you probably don't like
[1:09:24] don't use no bad word and your children
[1:09:29] can understand what I'm talking about
[1:09:31] but do you understand I'm talking about
[1:09:36] salvation for you and me we're about to
[1:09:43] future home until you get the earth
[1:09:44] right he said what do you mean by that I
[1:09:49] mean plain language don't worry about
[1:09:51] going to heaven until you get heaven
[1:09:53] right you realize we get ours here
[1:09:59] that's why we can go there we get the
[1:10:03] change of the body you remember what I
[1:10:05] was bringing out the other night there
[1:10:07] like Sunday the bride is the only one
[1:10:11] that does not have to die to inherit all
[1:10:15] things now some will keep on dying yeah
[1:10:19] but somebody's going to be changed v
[1:10:24] sells you 144,000 foolish virgins all of
[1:10:30] those have to die to be able to go to a
[1:10:34] future park
[1:10:40] come on Church time to get down serious
[1:10:46] to thinking about what we're doing if we
[1:10:50] are new creature according to the Bible
[1:10:53] go to the Bible we're a new creature in
[1:10:55] Christ if we're a new creature in Christ
[1:10:58] within old things are passed away but
[1:11:06] we're waiting the redemption of the body
[1:11:08] and that's what I'm trying to get you to
[1:11:10] see right now the stages that it said in
[1:11:14] this world will has been through
[1:11:17] justification it is in this stage of
[1:11:20] sanctification the Millennium is still
[1:11:22] under the sevens and all but then one
[1:11:26] day all will be made new are eternal and
[1:11:35] once it's made eternal then the city can
[1:11:42] come down you say the city can come down
[1:11:48] well I thought let's see if I'm a right
[1:11:52] now I go by the new birth that it made
[1:11:58] us resurrected sitting in heavenly
[1:11:59] places in Christ Jesus by the new birth
[1:12:03] I thought that was what it made us I
[1:12:05] thought it made our soul eternal waiting
[1:12:09] the redemption of the body this message
[1:12:13] would bring the entire plan of
[1:12:14] redemption unto us look at that great
[1:12:23] message he preached on the future home
[1:12:29] because our thinking we were such as I
[1:12:31] tried to explain it to you
[1:12:32] the all churches teach are used to used
[1:12:38] to teach that number seven was a rest
[1:12:41] day I heard that in the Baptist Church
[1:12:44] that it was arrest the eternal life was
[1:12:47] rest but we had no thoughts of the
[1:12:50] redemption of the body that's why we
[1:12:52] believe we
[1:12:53] we're gonna get a new one come on ever
[1:12:55] organized religion you name me one
[1:12:58] organized religion that don't believe
[1:13:00] they're gonna get a new body you want to
[1:13:06] name a few in this message about half of
[1:13:09] this message after all brother Branham
[1:13:12] has said still believes that we're going
[1:13:15] to get a new body why because they don't
[1:13:20] believe that the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:13:23] is sufficient to redeem this body it
[1:13:26] could do some supernatural thing and
[1:13:28] save the soul but can't do the bodies
[1:13:31] because we just got to be these bodies
[1:13:32] we've got to be we can't have these
[1:13:34] bodies just remember I'm not all that
[1:13:46] hard you don't sin with your body you
[1:13:50] sin from your spirit that's within you
[1:13:53] you can't sin from your body it has
[1:13:57] nothing to do other than display
[1:13:59] what you're seeing is do you want to
[1:14:03] stay with some kind of a display
[1:14:11] but what is organized religion believe
[1:14:13] you don't get anybody - the people of
[1:14:16] this message believe anyway listen to
[1:14:19] what you're listening to on these
[1:14:21] internets
[1:14:23] I've got one brother in mind if you
[1:14:26] asked me what that brother believed in
[1:14:28] and getting a new body or this body
[1:14:30] redeemed I tell you I don't know and
[1:14:32] I've known him for two years but I
[1:14:36] couldn't tell you what called one time
[1:14:38] he's new the next time he's redeemed but
[1:14:48] do you listen to that like that I just
[1:14:55] don't know I want this world I want this
[1:14:58] world throw the way and get me a new
[1:15:00] world
[1:15:00] I want this old body throw it away and
[1:15:03] get me a new body what the Lord Jesus
[1:15:12] was so hooked to Redemption until when
[1:15:15] he resurrected in his glorified body
[1:15:17] he still had nail prints anything in our
[1:15:21] scars in his side you must have lived in
[1:15:26] Redemption well what did we believe come
[1:15:32] on
[1:15:37] the nation shall not be able they can
[1:15:42] come into the city but you got to go
[1:15:45] back out as they're going out as I said
[1:15:48] the Bible says they take a leaf Prophet
[1:15:51] said it's for the healing of the
[1:15:52] nation's
[1:15:53] that they won't have no war no more they
[1:15:56] don't get the fruit now watch what I'm
[1:15:59] saying where's the seed of an apple is
[1:16:03] it didn't leave last time I checked it
[1:16:09] was in the Apple you know that's what a
[1:16:13] guy told me at work one time not talking
[1:16:15] about pecans and and you know there's an
[1:16:17] old thing runner comes out about like
[1:16:19] that I don't know if the corn it hangs
[1:16:21] down and he said yep said that's where
[1:16:23] that the cotton grows another for
[1:16:25] contrary yes
[1:16:26] what is he asses from that thing and
[1:16:30] hangs out time dropper the state is in
[1:16:39] the pecan that's the only way to get
[1:16:42] another pecan tree is planted for Colin
[1:16:44] no I shall make a deal with you and I
[1:16:48] done it I shall make a deal we as you
[1:16:52] plant a bushel of them stragglers and
[1:16:54] hangers whatever the hanging off I said
[1:16:57] I'm gonna go home and plant me a pecan I
[1:16:59] knew how to speed it up I said get me up
[1:17:02] a cone I'll bring it to you I'll show
[1:17:04] you the life is in the pecan not in the
[1:17:07] little thing that hangs off I did I
[1:17:10] cracked it and I kept it warm I got it
[1:17:12] to split open I took you back down that
[1:17:14] do it I said now you produce a seed you
[1:17:20] get what I'm saying
[1:17:23] they get to take the leaves for the
[1:17:25] healing of the nation's
[1:17:26] that's wonderful we get two apples off
[1:17:30] of the tree we get two seed off the tree
[1:17:34] we get your glorious things listen let
[1:17:41] me say this way I'll just make the point
[1:17:46] let me say it this way
[1:17:49] they ain't go to be no need of the moon
[1:17:53] stars like in the city but now outside
[1:17:58] the profits there they could be the even
[1:18:02] in the future home risen he says they
[1:18:05] can be things that those outside but
[1:18:09] I've told you there's no way for it to
[1:18:12] go black dark cuz then gonna be no
[1:18:15] clouds to cover over the moon and no
[1:18:17] matter where the moon that was done that
[1:18:19] it's gonna be light enough for you to be
[1:18:21] able to exist right but ain't no light
[1:18:30] in the city because the lamb is the
[1:18:34] light right the lamb is the light well I
[1:18:41] just don't see that I can't understand
[1:18:44] they got to be some kind of a situation
[1:18:48] that makes light or you want the
[1:18:50] Lightning burger we need to be people
[1:18:52] what are you walking what are you
[1:18:54] talking about you realize the outer
[1:19:06] courts of the temple that day night not
[1:19:13] time right
[1:19:18] inside was the candles right how do we
[1:19:25] make sure and kept live but you realize
[1:19:29] in this Shekinah glory
[1:19:30] there was no night there was no night
[1:19:40] behind that are in that interval this
[1:19:45] Shekinah glory was delight you realize
[1:19:50] that what I'm saying every where he's at
[1:19:52] is like you realize that whole city to
[1:19:55] be lit up because every where we're at
[1:19:57] is like it won't be that the outside
[1:20:03] people will look at you and see you
[1:20:04] glowing I'm not that far maybe it is but
[1:20:08] I don't think it's just the point of
[1:20:10] view of what I'm talking about
[1:20:11] wherever he is is light and in him is no
[1:20:15] darkness whatsoever even back in the Old
[1:20:18] Testament you had to daylight the dark
[1:20:24] out of court enter court you had
[1:20:28] candlelight seven candles had to be kept
[1:20:32] lit make sure but in behind the veil you
[1:20:36] had no darkness
[1:20:39] it was eternal don't even worry about
[1:20:46] trying to figure out your mind of how
[1:20:49] big city that's 1,500 square miles etc
[1:20:53] can be seen from all over the world
[1:20:55] unfolding brother branham how it would
[1:20:58] be a lot if he could do it behind the
[1:21:05] veil under tops and shadows the Prophet
[1:21:10] said a soft glowing light the Shekinah
[1:21:14] glory what's behind the veil you
[1:21:21] we know problem never where he's added
[1:21:25] like three women less tan come on
[1:21:30] musician think on these things I'm
[1:21:34] trying to preach the plan of redemption
[1:21:40] trying to take what said and just bring
[1:21:43] it down to where we can city cuz come on
[1:21:47] think about it Church you remember this
[1:21:55] the way the Prophet described that
[1:21:58] priest they had a failure that they put
[1:22:03] to mana in to keep it were the priests
[1:22:05] it didn't take it back out and spread it
[1:22:07] to everybody
[1:22:08] it was left behind the veil and it never
[1:22:11] spoiled the reason it was dire it was
[1:22:14] for the new priests to come home and
[1:22:16] each time a new priest came on he was
[1:22:19] allowed to reach over in that pot and
[1:22:23] take a piece of that which was the same
[1:22:26] manner that they started with when Moses
[1:22:29] and Aaron in the same manner he was
[1:22:35] allowed to go in and take a piece of it
[1:22:37] body he wouldn't have put it in his
[1:22:39] pocket and carried out or spread it to
[1:22:41] anybody else that man I stayed behind
[1:22:44] the veil in the presence you remember
