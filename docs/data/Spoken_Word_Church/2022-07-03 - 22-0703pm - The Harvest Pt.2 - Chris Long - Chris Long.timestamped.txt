[19:14] would i want you to turn to revelations
[19:16] chapter three of course i realize in the
[19:19] day and the hour we live in
[19:21] i think i said this before and a brother
[19:23] found it for me they i want an app that
[19:25] makes the sound of the pages of the
[19:27] bible turning because folks don't turn
[19:29] the pages of the bible no more
[19:32] they just look at the screen and that's
[19:33] not to make anybody feel bad that's just
[19:35] the hour we live in i'll tell you what
[19:38] let this word be engraved
[19:41] in your hearts
[19:44] and that's the bible we're looking for
[19:46] revelations chapter three i'm gonna
[19:48] start with uh let's see over here verse
[19:51] 7
[19:53] and when you got it say amen
[19:56] unto the angel of the church in
[19:57] philadelphia write
[19:59] these things saith he that is holy he
[20:02] that is true
[20:03] he that hath the key of david he that
[20:05] openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth
[20:08] and no man openeth
[20:10] i know thy works
[20:12] behold
[20:13] i have set before thee
[20:16] an open door
[20:18] that's why i had you stop at the door
[20:19] right there
[20:20] and no man can shut it
[20:22] for thou hast a little strength and has
[20:24] kept my word and has not denied my name
[20:27] wow praise the lord behold i will make
[20:31] them
[20:32] of the synagogue of satan which say
[20:36] they are jews
[20:37] and are not
[20:39] but do lie behold i will make them to
[20:42] come and worship before thy feet
[20:45] and to know that i have loved thee
[20:47] because thou has kept the word of my
[20:50] patience i also will keep thee from the
[20:53] hour of temptation which shall come upon
[20:56] all the world to try them that dwell
[20:59] upon the earth
[21:00] behold i come quickly
[21:02] hold that fast which thou hast that no
[21:05] man take thy crown
[21:07] him that overcometh will i make a pillar
[21:09] in the temple of my god he shall go no
[21:11] more out and i will write upon him the
[21:13] name of my god in the name of the city
[21:16] of my god which is the new jerusalem
[21:18] which cometh down out of heaven from my
[21:21] god and i will write upon him my new
[21:24] name he that hath an ear
[21:26] let him hear
[21:27] what the spirit saith
[21:29] unto the churches let's pray father lord
[21:32] once again the reading of your word lord
[21:34] is sufficient
[21:35] father for the ears that would hear lord
[21:37] but the heart that yearns and cries out
[21:40] father for the deeper meaning lord and
[21:43] the intimate relationship with the
[21:45] author of this word father that's our
[21:47] desire tonight father we ask that you'd
[21:49] come down
[21:51] and come out yes
[21:54] and speak to us lord
[21:56] that's our desire
[21:58] for your honor and glory in jesus
[22:00] christ's name we pray
[22:02] amen god bless you baby seated now the
[22:04] reason that i read that is as the lord
[22:07] again dealing with me on these things um
[22:10] it seems like a strange scripture for me
[22:12] to read because we are in fact in the
[22:14] laodicean church age
[22:17] but
[22:18] in in in in looking over the word of the
[22:21] hour we find out that the prophet of god
[22:24] mentions quite often this open door he
[22:27] makes he makes it plain he makes it
[22:29] clear that it was set there for a
[22:31] purpose now we know that a door
[22:34] uh it can be
[22:35] described or used in many different ways
[22:39] and uh it it it's um
[22:42] it's it's a thing that that um as as we
[22:46] have explained before it a door can be
[22:49] shut
[22:52] but it can also be open while it's shut
[22:55] right
[22:56] by definition
[22:58] if you unlock a door even though it
[23:02] looks as if it is blocking the way of
[23:05] the passage
[23:07] because it's unlocked it's open amen it
[23:11] may look close to the natural eye but
[23:14] it's open to those who know something
[23:16] that no one else knows they see the door
[23:20] it looks like it's shut well in fact
[23:23] this door in
[23:25] revelations
[23:27] the philadelphian church age
[23:29] to many
[23:31] is still shut
[23:33] the bible says it's an open door for us
[23:36] that means it's unlocked
[23:40] it still could be could be used to block
[23:43] the passage for those who do not know
[23:46] that it's unlocked but for those that
[23:49] know it's unlocked they walk right up
[23:51] through it turn the knob and they go
[23:53] right amen through it
[23:56] so now we have another side to the open
[24:00] door
[24:02] now the reason i read it out of out of
[24:04] the philadelphian or the sixth church
[24:07] age is because
[24:08] the prophet of god taught something and
[24:10] i remember uh many years ago i've been
[24:13] around and acquainted with the message
[24:15] for 43 years and and and and when i
[24:18] first got saved and and the lord brought
[24:20] me uh right to the message um
[24:23] i i remember there was there were you
[24:25] know and i'll use the word controversial
[24:27] but maybe they were just doctrines and
[24:29] things that men were pondering and and
[24:32] wondering about and conversing with and
[24:34] discussing you know how it is um and
[24:37] some of them were arguing yes and some
[24:39] of them were disputing yes but some of
[24:41] them were trying to come to a revelation
[24:46] now remember he's an on-time god
[24:49] and the prophet of god even makes it
[24:51] clear to us that if it wasn't time for
[24:53] those things to be revealed they would
[24:55] remain a mystery
[24:58] right now we know that the seventh
[25:00] church age messenger according to the
[25:02] scriptures the seventh angel was sent
[25:04] for a purpose and that purpose was to be
[25:07] used by god to unlock
[25:10] or open the mysteries that had been kept
[25:14] back and hidden
[25:15] throughout the ages before
[25:18] he used it he used a term like this
[25:21] tie up
[25:22] the loose ends he said that was the
[25:25] responsibility and the ministry of the
[25:28] seventh angel now in spoken word is the
[25:30] original seed and i know i've read it
[25:32] here brother branham also says he
[25:35] believed that his mission
[25:39] the reason that he was here
[25:41] now we realized that there were many
[25:44] reasons given
[25:45] but now
[25:46] in spoken word as the original seed he's
[25:49] going to begin to speak
[25:51] words that only the original seed are
[25:55] going to make a connection with so he
[25:57] said my mission i believe to the world
[26:00] is to forerun the coming word wait a
[26:03] minute i thought the word was already
[26:05] here what else is there to come
[26:13] whether you realize it or not i'm
[26:15] looking at that coming word
[26:18] that would be you and me
[26:21] in the mind of god before the foundation
[26:24] of the world i believe each one of us
[26:27] represented
[26:28] something
[26:30] that god was going to write down one day
[26:35] and then he was going to let the words
[26:38] on the paper come to life
[26:41] as it says in john 1 1 and the beginning
[26:43] was the word
[26:45] and the word was with god and the word
[26:48] was god so we know that the word and god
[26:51] are one but he wasn't finished
[26:55] he's an on-time god
[26:57] what he wanted to do was express himself
[27:00] through material
[27:02] tangible
[27:04] attributes
[27:05] because god is a spirit
[27:07] no man has seen god at any time but god
[27:10] wanted to be seen amen
[27:13] so he he set in motion a plan where that
[27:17] invisible god could come down
[27:20] he had to come down
[27:23] he couldn't go up because he was the
[27:24] highest thing there was
[27:26] so he had to condemn sin down and the
[27:29] way that he he he he set this up was he
[27:34] knew because he had no beginning very
[27:36] very difficult for you and i to
[27:38] understand come on think about i mean i
[27:40] don't care how intelligent you are and
[27:41] whether you're a capify and you're uh
[27:44] and you're a 4.2 and and whatever you
[27:47] are yeah
[27:48] a doctor a phd
[27:50] degree is all over the wall that's okay
[27:52] i'm i'm good with that
[27:56] how are you going to understand a being
[27:58] that had no beginning and will have no
[28:00] end how you going to do it
[28:02] the only way you're going to do it is to
[28:05] have been part of that being
[28:08] that's the only way
[28:10] there ain't no other way
[28:12] amen oh i feel good
[28:19] we realized that
[28:22] god's plan
[28:26] required god to be just yes that's right
[28:31] fair
[28:33] everybody's gets a chance
[28:36] but he knew
[28:37] that there would be because of the fall
[28:41] a great
[28:42] number of people manifest on the earth
[28:47] through that fall
[28:49] that were not in his mind before the
[28:52] foundation of the world i like to to to
[28:56] classify them as collateral benefactors
[28:59] just the fact that they were given an
[29:01] opportunity for life and choice would
[29:03] make them a collateral benefactor now
[29:06] the choice was theirs to make and
[29:08] imagine
[29:09] okay
[29:11] in a way
[29:12] in a way
[29:14] you and i didn't have a choice in a way
[29:17] i want you to understand that now in
[29:18] order for him to be a just god he had to
[29:21] put everybody on the same playing field
[29:23] amen
[29:25] so we do have a choice
[29:29] but what we are beginning to realize is
[29:32] that the choices that we make today were
[29:35] based on where we came from all right
[29:40] that's right
[29:42] in the mind of god
[29:44] before the foundation of the world
[29:48] he said
[29:50] let me get my book out
[29:51] [Music]
[29:53] because all of my attributes are going
[29:54] to make the right choice
[29:56] i don't care what condition they're in
[29:58] i don't care what they have to go
[30:00] through if they're my attributes they're
[30:03] going to make a right choice and he said
[30:05] scribe get that pin yeah
[30:07] dip it in that blot of blood right there
[30:10] and you begin to write names on that
[30:11] book
[30:13] because their names are going to
[30:14] manifest themselves those my attributes
[30:16] them my children and at the end of their
[30:19] life at least by then they will make the
[30:21] right choice
[30:24] now some of us had to go through hell
[30:26] and high water to make that choice
[30:28] others of us started when we were fresh
[30:30] and clean and young and praise the lord
[30:33] you ain't wearing all the scars somebody
[30:35] like i got right brother they're not
[30:37] tattoos now they're scars
[30:42] big difference
[30:46] thanks be to god amen
[30:47] [Music]
[30:49] you wear a scar long enough
[30:51] and it starts to fade
[30:54] you know it starts to blend in
[30:57] after a while it just becomes a part of
[30:59] you yeah and if you get old like me
[31:02] you'll say i wonder i i know i got that
[31:05] little spot right there but don't quite
[31:07] remember how i got that then you make a
[31:08] story up
[31:12] you embellish on it you know now i kind
[31:14] of remember something but uh but okay so
[31:16] here it is yeah yeah god knows god god
[31:19] knows
[31:22] we're scarred that's right amen
[31:27] so in order for him
[31:31] to come across
[31:33] as just
[31:35] a responsible god which he is
[31:39] affair
[31:42] because i know a lot of people say well
[31:43] that ain't fair yeah well get your
[31:46] dictionary out
[31:47] yeah
[31:49] he spoke in parables yes you did amen
[31:52] i was referring earlier to you today
[31:54] matthew 13 it starts out parables and of
[31:57] course the disciples are wondering why
[31:58] you're you know what are you doing
[32:00] talking in parables well i'm talking in
[32:02] perils because there are those that
[32:04] i'm going to just cut it to the chase
[32:06] they weren't meant to be nope
[32:08] right but but and they got and i want to
[32:10] be fair to them so so i want them to
[32:12] make a choice based on something they
[32:14] don't understand right yeah think about
[32:17] it
[32:19] they don't understand what he's saying
[32:21] so then they begin
[32:23] to you know
[32:25] look into it and study it and see but to
[32:28] those
[32:31] who were his children
[32:34] it's not a parable
[32:37] it has a meaning
[32:38] the word parable means a short
[32:41] allegorical story designed to illustrate
[32:43] or teach some truth religious principle
[32:46] or moral lesson it also means a
[32:48] statement or comment that conveys a
[32:52] meaning
[32:53] indirectly
[32:55] by the use of comparison analogy or the
[32:59] like
[33:00] yeah
[33:03] paul uses the word allegory
[33:06] or allegory depending on how you want to
[33:08] pronounce it
[33:09] galatians 4.
[33:11] allegory a representation of an abstract
[33:14] oh i like that already
[33:17] or spiritual meaning through listen now
[33:21] concrete or material forms of course i'm
[33:24] thinking of cement that's not the word
[33:29] figurative treatment of
[33:32] one
[33:33] subject
[33:35] under the guise which like a disguise
[33:39] of another amen okay this is an allegory
[33:41] a symbolical narrative
[33:45] from a greek word
[33:47] alegria to speak
[33:50] so as to imply something else now do you
[33:54] all remember me coming here and
[33:55] preaching on revelations the book of
[33:57] symbols
[34:00] so to you and i the word parable and the
[34:03] word allegory are words that are are are
[34:06] from the middle english language
[34:09] they were used because king james court
[34:11] and his translators found what they
[34:14] thought was the best word to represent
[34:16] in english the greek or the latin so in
[34:19] today's world we would use the word
[34:21] metaphor
[34:24] they've tried to turn it into a
[34:25] metaverse
[34:27] but it's a metaphor
[34:30] a figure of speech
[34:32] in which a term or phrase is applied to
[34:36] something
[34:37] to which it is not literally applicable
[34:40] in order to suggest a resemblance
[34:44] what's the dictionary brother wade i
[34:46] didn't put this down the dictionary said
[34:48] it said as in
[34:51] a mighty fortress is our god
[34:54] when i saw that in the dictionary i said
[34:56] where'd this dictionary come from
[34:59] now god himself the spirit is not a
[35:03] mighty fortress but a mighty fortress is
[35:06] our god it's a metaphor
[35:09] for our god amen you got that
[35:12] yes sir you're probably wondering where
[35:13] is he going with this oh i'm going right
[35:16] to the tent
[35:17] i'm going right to the door
[35:20] but just hang on is the door open or
[35:22] closed
[35:23] the question is the bible says it's an
[35:25] open door then you have to ask yourself
[35:28] whether it's a jar
[35:32] that means open like that right or just
[35:35] unlocked yeah all right come on he's the
[35:37] just god brother amen it's an open door
[35:39] amen
[35:41] for you and me it's unlocked
[35:45] it doesn't have to be literally
[35:47] open passageway why because jesus didn't
[35:50] consider it when he walked into the
[35:52] upper room where the fellas was all
[35:54] crying over the crucifixion he just come
[35:55] right through the wall yeah that's right
[35:58] what's up what's up boys
[36:00] what
[36:02] you know and doubting thomas
[36:05] all right
[36:07] listen to this metaphor something used
[36:10] or
[36:10] regarded as being used to represent
[36:14] something else it said emblem or symbol
[36:18] from latin and greek metaphoric
[36:21] to transfer whoa
[36:23] i saw that i said praise the lord i like
[36:25] that one already but the reason that i
[36:27] read these to you
[36:29] is so that you could understand now okay
[36:31] watch this now so when king david said
[36:34] in the psalms my bones they stare at me
[36:38] was he talking of himself or another
[36:41] come on yeah
[36:42] so when the prophet of god said i'll
[36:44] ride this trail again was he talking of
[36:46] himself
[36:47] or another
[36:49] well it would take the holy spirit
[36:52] through the revelation of god the author
[36:54] of that word to clearly
[36:59] bring the picture into development
[37:02] is that right now i'm just using that as
[37:06] a metaphor
[37:08] it's a parable yeah well when i began to
[37:13] look into
[37:14] the definition
[37:16] of harvest
[37:18] based upon
[37:19] the third part of it and remember
[37:23] god works in threes
[37:25] fives sevens eight
[37:27] ten
[37:28] twelve
[37:29] right you understand amen but three is
[37:32] what we're interested in because it's
[37:35] perfection
[37:36] five is what we spend most of our time
[37:39] on because it's grace it's mercy it's
[37:42] faith you understand all that but god
[37:45] himself
[37:46] implemented a plan where he was
[37:48] perfected in three amen
[37:51] so again
[37:53] we have
[37:54] the three stages of the journey
[37:56] stalk tossing shuck
[37:58] now the grain that is coming forth
[38:02] is not the fourth stage of the journey
[38:05] it's the
[38:07] result of the first three
[38:10] because the number four is the number of
[38:12] earth it's man's number we're interested
[38:15] in god
[38:18] as we know
[38:20] because of the harvest
[38:22] the stock tossal and shuck represent the
[38:25] three stages of
[38:28] justification sanctification
[38:31] baptism of the holy ghost
[38:33] and you must have all three
[38:37] those three stages must be
[38:40] working in your life at all times in
[38:44] order for you to become the producer
[38:48] the carrier of the life so to speak
[38:51] of the grain
[38:53] but i learned something
[38:55] brother branham preached a message
[38:57] called three kinds of believers and he
[39:00] broke it down and he said there's three
[39:02] kinds of believers in every church and
[39:03] as soon as you hear that you start going
[39:06] yeah
[39:07] i don't know about them yeah about them
[39:09] up there
[39:10] i'm the only believer in the place
[39:14] but i want you to understand
[39:16] the three kinds of believers was
[39:18] referring to the church
[39:22] well i'm speaking to the bride
[39:25] i'm speaking to the grain
[39:29] did you realize that the grain itself
[39:33] the wheat the corn of wheat
[39:36] also has three stages
[39:40] oh yeah i talk i i was taught this on a
[39:43] documentary about wheat
[39:47] think about where we're at amen
[39:50] three kinds of believers in every church
[39:54] now let's let's elevate again
[39:57] let's go to the grain elevator and let's
[39:59] get to the grain
[40:02] the wheat grain or kernel
[40:04] is broken down into three parts
[40:08] the bran
[40:10] or the outer shell which is high in
[40:12] fiber it'll scratch it
[40:16] the next is called the endosperm
[40:19] or the pulp
[40:21] it's full of starch
[40:24] it's the part of the wheat grain that's
[40:27] not very healthy
[40:32] bran
[40:33] has
[40:34] bran has some
[40:36] properties in it that will help you
[40:41] the endosperm which makes up 83
[40:45] of the grain is the part of the grain
[40:48] that science has figured out
[40:51] how to manipulate
[40:54] now now i want you to say well that oh a
[40:57] biology lesson oh it's a lesson on
[40:59] church
[41:02] we understand we understand the
[41:04] lutherans and the wesleyans and the
[41:08] pentecost but do we understand ourselves
[41:10] do we understand what part
[41:13] of the process
[41:16] of god
[41:18] that we are amen but blessed be the name
[41:20] of the lord
[41:22] the colonel also has something called
[41:27] the germ
[41:29] now you run that word through your
[41:32] message concordance and find out where
[41:34] you're at
[41:36] it's the germ of life that makes the
[41:39] difference amen now science and
[41:42] biologists cannot manipulate the wheat
[41:46] plant without the germ
[41:50] but what they've done is they've
[41:52] manipulated the other two parts of the
[41:55] plant so the germ
[41:57] can't reproduce itself
[42:04] you're with me
[42:05] amen right oh i'm getting to it
[42:08] the brand makes up 14 and a half percent
[42:11] the germ makes up 2.5
[42:16] of the entire
[42:18] kernel
[42:19] i want you to think about it now
[42:21] the brand is rough
[42:23] now brother brandon preached three kinds
[42:25] of believers in every
[42:27] church
[42:29] he said that the unbeliever sets around
[42:32] now watch the way we think because i i
[42:34] i'm just like you uh so the unbeliever
[42:37] is going to walk in the back door
[42:38] they're going to hear something they
[42:40] don't like and they're going to leave it
[42:41] could be 40 years before they hear
[42:44] something they don't like and leave
[42:47] i've seen it
[42:51] and leave
[42:53] the word of god for their own
[42:54] denominational differences
[42:58] but that's just a little old tiny
[43:00] 14 and a half percent
[43:04] it's this 83
[43:06] that's the danger
[43:09] that's the make believer and brother
[43:11] brown said that's the guy you gotta
[43:14] watch now brothers and sisters don't be
[43:16] looking over your shoulders
[43:19] because i'm here to tell you that each
[43:20] one of us are represented as this
[43:23] colonel and this guy right here you're
[43:25] looking at preaching to you
[43:28] is three kinds of believers
[43:30] oh yeah this thing out here is unbelief
[43:32] to the max right it don't like anything
[43:35] that's said yep right
[43:37] the guy there on the inside the spirit
[43:39] he'll contend and he'll reason and he'll
[43:42] but the guy down in the control room you
[43:44] know that 2.5 percent has to tell this
[43:47] 84 shut up
[43:52] keep to yourself
[43:54] that bread you're making ain't no good
[43:56] for nobody yeah see because that's where
[43:58] they get the bread that's not any good
[44:00] you've heard of wheat you've heard of
[44:01] bran wheat bran
[44:03] the endosperm
[44:05] the pope
[44:06] they can manipulate it into anything and
[44:08] it's just full of starch and guess what
[44:10] it's doing it's killing us
[44:12] [Music]
[44:13] catch it
[44:15] so there's a spiritual man on the inside
[44:17] of you that wants you to die
[44:24] but if god's
[44:26] spirit is down on the inside
[44:29] there's two and a half percent of you
[44:32] that can control
[44:35] that can create
[44:36] amen that can destroy
[44:39] that can speak
[44:40] that can be silent
[44:43] and get more done
[44:45] than all the rest of the colony
[44:51] i said all that
[44:52] so that you'd understand
[44:54] god's perfected
[44:56] in thrace
[44:58] amen
[44:59] because what we're going to enter into
[45:01] here in a few minutes is what you and i
[45:03] have been told is called the third pull
[45:07] three now see because somebody's
[45:10] who the third pole no no no no no we
[45:12] don't we don't do that here well then
[45:14] you don't fish
[45:16] see it's that simple
[45:18] these terms are given to us so that we
[45:21] can come to an understanding of what god
[45:24] expects of us but they're in parables
[45:26] amen all right
[45:28] they're allegories they're metaphors
[45:32] why
[45:33] to hide
[45:35] the true intent
[45:39] from those who
[45:41] it was not meant for that's right amen
[45:43] so brothers and sisters you say well
[45:47] i don't know brother chris i mean you
[45:48] know i i haven't been able to figure
[45:50] that out don't try to figure it out i
[45:52] can't figure this out i'm going to read
[45:53] to you in a minute where don't try to
[45:54] explain this
[45:56] well what are you doing up there
[45:57] preaching oh i'm not trying to explain
[45:58] it
[46:01] it's impossible
[46:03] to explain yeah right
[46:06] it's not a public show
[46:08] right but that doesn't mean you catch
[46:10] out
[46:11] that's right
[46:12] it's something going on on the inside
[46:14] you know that two and a half percent of
[46:16] that little colonel there it's doing
[46:17] some shouting amen
[46:21] should be
[46:22] because that's me
[46:25] when you realize who you are
[46:27] you ain't going to be quiet it's like
[46:30] that fellow that told brother brandon
[46:31] why i really liked your message brother
[46:33] brown tell that lady over there start
[46:34] shouting
[46:36] think about it he's trying to tell us
[46:39] something he's not trying to tell us to
[46:41] be outward emotional and in the flesh
[46:43] and pentecostal by denomination he's
[46:45] telling us there's a life on the inside
[46:48] and when that life begins to move and it
[46:51] begins to see what it is and where it
[46:54] came from who it is and where it's going
[46:56] it's going to do a little bit of
[46:57] shouting amen
[46:58] now i can tell by looking at you some of
[47:00] you have never shouted in your life
[47:05] but we'll shout for the music or we'll
[47:07] shout for the baseball football game
[47:09] we'll shout for this we'll shout for
[47:11] that we'll shout if we catch a big fish
[47:13] we really shout if we don't catch no
[47:14] fish
[47:17] you understand
[47:19] but if something's moving on the inside
[47:22] you can't help it but go oh at least a
[47:24] little whoa oh that's me
[47:30] because there's life in it
[47:32] that's the reason why there's life in it
[47:34] amen
[47:35] right
[47:38] i just love god's word amen
[47:41] it's the best
[47:43] so let me move forward a little bit
[47:45] i'm going to finish the paragraph i
[47:47] started with you earlier
[47:50] i know what's in here
[47:53] i got this far
[47:55] oh she'll be a little bitty group
[47:58] jesus said it's uh harvest time
[48:00] page 44 in this edition here
[48:03] watch i'm just going to read a couple
[48:04] more sentences
[48:06] oh she'll be such a little bitty group
[48:08] see that's that little tiny germ that's
[48:10] in that entire kernel because that's the
[48:13] stage of the journey we're at it doesn't
[48:16] mean the other folks aren't saved no all
[48:18] right brother come on that's right come
[48:20] on you got it
[48:22] there's there's millions going to be
[48:24] saved but the bride see the little meaty
[48:26] group think about the size of the plant
[48:28] and that little bitty seed
[48:33] it should be such a little bitty group
[48:34] jesus said it was as it was in the days
[48:36] of noah
[48:38] wherein eight souls was saved is that
[48:41] right so shall it be in the coming of
[48:44] the son of man it didn't say revealing
[48:48] it said coming of the son of man how
[48:50] many i don't know but see the bride
[48:53] see i was taking it now the church has
[48:57] already got their reward
[48:59] and it is salvation and a lot of people
[49:02] would stop right there and go that's all
[49:03] i need fine
[49:05] we shouldn't be down on them or against
[49:08] that praise the lord that there's
[49:10] salvation for the multitude but the
[49:13] bride she's made up so much differently
[49:15] you know that fourteen and a half
[49:17] percent and 83 they got to go along with
[49:20] the two and a half percent
[49:22] that germ that life in there is crying
[49:24] out for some what's he crying for what
[49:27] in the world if you were the colonel
[49:29] yeah if you were the corn of wheat what
[49:31] would you need to cry out for to bring
[49:34] forth after your kind
[49:37] and his kind was life not death right
[49:42] that's where we're at amen
[49:45] it's life
[49:46] calling
[49:47] for life
[49:49] it's not life calling for death and then
[49:52] life that happened two thousand years
[49:54] ago
[49:55] i can read to you somewhere in here
[49:56] where brother branham says
[49:59] jesus
[50:01] went into the grave and when he rose
[50:05] that was perfection amen right yeah
[50:09] because he only needed to raise one time
[50:12] to prove you cannot kill that life
[50:16] that life cannot die but here we are 2
[50:19] 000 years later brother branham preaches
[50:22] the message i indict this generation for
[50:24] the second crucifixion you can't crucify
[50:27] jesus christ two times but what they
[50:29] didn't realize is they were crucifying
[50:32] the word
[50:34] that he is
[50:36] not him
[50:38] in the beginning was the word the word
[50:40] was with god
[50:41] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[50:43] us and they crucified the word made
[50:47] flesh
[50:48] so what satan decided that he would do
[50:51] in the hour we live in is begin
[50:54] to hybrid god's word to mix it to to
[50:58] bring it to a place where it could not
[51:00] reproduce itself and bring forth life i
[51:03] got news for you devil
[51:06] you cannot kill that life
[51:09] that life is here and now
[51:11] and it exists in the hearts of god's
[51:14] children and you cannot kill it
[51:20] that's why they're waiting on us
[51:23] it's beautiful as as it is beyond the
[51:25] curtain of time where the prophet went
[51:27] and they didn't sweat and they didn't
[51:29] work and they didn't have to go to the
[51:30] mailbox and get the bills out and they
[51:32] had to go to work they didn't have to
[51:34] get their own straw that's right
[51:37] hey what's happening hey
[51:38] it was free
[51:40] the temperature was perfect
[51:44] they didn't get hungry
[51:47] didn't get thirsty
[51:50] did you know there was still something
[51:52] wrong with that picture absolutely yes
[51:54] sir
[51:55] yes sir
[51:56] that was not the complete
[51:58] plan
[51:59] of god amen
[52:02] the process
[52:03] of the plan of god
[52:05] do you know that everybody that goes
[52:07] before you and me is waiting for you
[52:11] and me amen
[52:12] they listen now they can't
[52:16] be
[52:16] made perfect
[52:18] what
[52:19] why sounds like a perfect place to meet
[52:21] they're not eating nope all right all
[52:23] right they're not drinking
[52:26] they're not walking down here on their
[52:28] inheritance
[52:30] you see they're waiting for something
[52:32] hey that's right amen
[52:34] and i believe
[52:35] we got the devil's answer right here
[52:38] i believe with all my heart listen
[52:40] careful now
[52:43] how many
[52:45] i don't know he says
[52:47] but see the bible the bride is going to
[52:50] be made up of all down through
[52:55] then he's pauses and he says that had
[52:57] the word in their age
[53:00] it's not just this last group
[53:04] god is going to take the whole
[53:07] thing out of here
[53:09] oh no it'll be so small he says it'll be
[53:13] surprising
[53:15] they'll come up missing and you won't
[53:17] even know they're gone
[53:19] what if
[53:21] you know but by the way see i get
[53:22] launched off on that did you realize
[53:24] you're looking at me preaching to you
[53:26] and i want you to know i'm missing
[53:30] and you don't even know it right
[53:33] see because the man on the inside is
[53:34] being raptured
[53:36] he's being caught up into heavenly
[53:38] places in christ jesus i mean he's
[53:40] really sitting beyond the curtain of
[53:42] time but he realizes that's not enough
[53:46] all right
[53:46] said you ain't living without something
[53:49] dying
[53:50] that's right
[53:51] well brother branham the seven-day
[53:53] adventist kind of shot out at him and
[53:54] said i'm i was surprised to hear you eat
[53:56] eggs and meat what's wrong with that
[53:58] brother
[53:59] he said well you're killing substance he
[54:01] said so are you
[54:02] the air you breathe
[54:04] the lettuce you eat
[54:06] the enzymes the germs see people see how
[54:09] they are they think in terms of
[54:13] yeah denominational
[54:15] differences right right that's not the
[54:18] way we're to think
[54:20] we're to look at god's word and we're to
[54:22] say this is god's plan now where
[54:25] do i fit that's right amen
[54:27] and king david had a revelation
[54:30] he said
[54:32] let me be the gate keeper
[54:36] let me be the gatekeeper
[54:40] and in the day we live in
[54:42] the prophet came and said let me be the
[54:44] door
[54:45] matt
[54:48] you catch that
[54:49] let me be the door
[54:51] matt amen you know why he said that
[54:53] because david was going to be the
[54:54] gatekeeper yeah
[54:56] because he asked for it
[55:00] listen
[55:03] they'll come up missing you won't even
[55:05] know they're gone what if he took 500 in
[55:07] this last days
[55:08] think about it think about the day we
[55:09] live in there's they're snatching up
[55:11] children left or night by the tens of
[55:12] the thousands and they go missing
[55:15] they're selling them and using them and
[55:16] abusing them and so forth all the time
[55:19] now you might know somebody personally
[55:20] that happened too but the world
[55:23] who's jane doe
[55:26] it's not just this last group god is
[55:28] going to take the whole thing out of
[55:30] here they'll come up missing you would
[55:32] never know it took 500 in a few days
[55:36] time two or three days there's that many
[55:38] people comes up missing across the world
[55:40] and they don't even know where they're
[55:41] at never hear nothing about them he then
[55:44] he stops and he says the
[55:46] secret coming
[55:49] of the lord jesus
[55:51] she'll be taken away amen do you realize
[55:54] the reason it's a secret is because
[55:57] nobody
[55:59] would know
[56:01] anything
[56:02] about it
[56:05] and i'm telling you this
[56:08] because it's happening in you
[56:12] and me
[56:14] you say well we're waiting on the coming
[56:16] of the lord
[56:18] he's been here 2000 years yeah as
[56:20] charles johnson would say yeah
[56:22] [Laughter]
[56:24] he's been here 2000 years
[56:26] he has
[56:27] he's been here
[56:28] that's how the prophet
[56:31] was given the ability to be able to
[56:32] produce
[56:34] the results
[56:35] it it wasn't william mariam branham he
[56:39] even says it on his own words and
[56:42] recordings he said it's jesus christ
[56:45] so then of course people go hmm yeah oh
[56:47] he's jesus christ no he didn't say that
[56:50] he wouldn't allow that you and i
[56:52] wouldn't allow that but he would allow
[56:54] for you to call him the bride
[56:58] because she
[57:00] is part of him
[57:02] is that right she's mrs
[57:06] jesus
[57:08] look at the day and age we live in i
[57:09] won't preach on it but it's chaos if
[57:12] people don't realize we're in chaos they
[57:14] may never realize it okay
[57:17] so in revelations 3
[57:20] as we read
[57:21] about the philadelphian church age the
[57:24] prophet of god taught something i'm
[57:25] going to go back to where i was at this
[57:27] controversy that i'd heard 40 some years
[57:29] ago they said well the prophet always
[57:32] comes at the end of the age have you
[57:35] heard that yes sir
[57:37] but if you read everything he said
[57:40] he said it's the previous
[57:44] h
[57:46] so that's why he was born in 1909 if you
[57:49] want dates
[57:51] pentecost started in 1906 it began to
[57:54] dominate in 1914 1516 right in there
[57:59] but god set now watch now you see you
[58:02] got to be careful god set an open door
[58:06] now that open door was not william mary
[58:08] and branham it was the jesus christ
[58:12] that was using william mary and branham
[58:15] he's the door to the sheepfold because
[58:18] he's the good
[58:20] shepherd you're with me
[58:24] but you need to say well thanks
[58:25] how you getting to the tent vision on
[58:27] this
[58:29] it's a series of events
[58:32] and because of the definition of
[58:34] harvest time this series of events
[58:37] begins to separate to cut
[58:41] to shear
[58:42] according to the definition now you and
[58:44] i aren't doing the separating
[58:47] but we can be involved in what causes
[58:50] the separation we can either go on that
[58:53] side or that side but you're not going
[58:56] to be able to remain in the center
[58:58] because it's not the definition of
[59:00] harvest
[59:02] it's separating it's taking one thing
[59:06] from another and one thing from another
[59:09] and do you know where you and i come in
[59:11] you die out to yourself
[59:14] you want to separate separate from your
[59:15] old life
[59:17] separate from your thoughts
[59:19] separate from your dying body
[59:23] there's a man on the inside you know the
[59:25] old song there's a man in here who turns
[59:27] water to wine do you see him
[59:30] but he's in here amen
[59:33] he walks on the water gives sight to the
[59:35] blind
[59:36] gives back life to the ones that's dead
[59:39] he fed 4 000.
[59:41] with seven loaves of bread
[59:43] he's here
[59:44] but you've got to come to the
[59:46] realization that that is what is going
[59:49] on in your life and brother and sister
[59:51] if you can't see that far yet you get
[59:54] there and it's all up to you
[59:57] it's not up to the pastor it's not up to
[59:59] the teaching or the preaching or the
[1:00:00] tapes or the prophet it's up to you he's
[1:00:03] a just god he's a fair god and he said
[1:00:06] you make the choice that's why we're on
[1:00:08] free moral agency brother branham would
[1:00:11] say it like this he didn't say wade
[1:00:12] you're not going and brother you're
[1:00:14] going
[1:00:15] he said you two got a choice you want to
[1:00:17] go or not right
[1:00:19] but because of foreknowledge
[1:00:21] which is based on
[1:00:22] his knowledge of himself
[1:00:27] he knew who would and would not because
[1:00:30] he knew who was in him or who was not
[1:00:33] now you say well well i don't know about
[1:00:34] me brother you're making the choice
[1:00:37] that's right
[1:00:38] you want to be in him
[1:00:40] [Music]
[1:00:42] [Applause]
[1:00:49] i was in him and then of course there's
[1:00:50] this little black guy in the black hand
[1:00:53] hey hey
[1:00:54] hey hey little guy over here going hey
[1:00:56] hey hey
[1:00:58] thank you
[1:00:59] think about it bro he's
[1:01:01] no you're not the one remember what you
[1:01:03] did yesterday remember that thought you
[1:01:05] got you know last night while you were
[1:01:08] praying
[1:01:10] there's a guy over here says shut up
[1:01:14] you got to get there amen
[1:01:16] that's where we're at it's harvest time
[1:01:19] and harvest time is a separation
[1:01:21] and what's being separated in us is
[1:01:24] god's word and our reason
[1:01:27] and our reason is not going to shut up
[1:01:30] even if we tell it to well
[1:01:33] what we got to do is we be god again to
[1:01:36] starve it to death
[1:01:39] because it doesn't have life after death
[1:01:42] once it dies now watch this now i'm
[1:01:45] going to get serious with you
[1:01:46] it doesn't have life after death no you
[1:01:49] agree amen
[1:01:50] once the hybrid seed dies it's
[1:01:54] finished
[1:01:55] but guess what the children of god have
[1:01:59] a resurrection power in them and they
[1:02:03] have the ability to raise that stinking
[1:02:06] life up
[1:02:10] cause that's what's gonna happen at the
[1:02:11] judgment every stinking life that went
[1:02:14] down
[1:02:15] is gonna have to be raised up
[1:02:17] and set
[1:02:19] at the white throne judgment amen
[1:02:22] so let's not let it race back
[1:02:25] let's leave it in the grave amen how by
[1:02:29] the words of life
[1:02:31] let them prevail let them be your
[1:02:33] driving force let them be your yay and
[1:02:37] your amen
[1:02:38] amen yeah
[1:02:40] it's really see because people are like
[1:02:41] that's impossible
[1:02:43] so i can just say i'm saying come on now
[1:02:44] it's possible
[1:02:46] yeah that's what the disciples thought
[1:02:48] when a rich man couldn't go to heaven
[1:02:51] it's impossible yeah he said come on
[1:02:53] guys
[1:02:54] all things are possible amen with god
[1:02:56] and all things are possible to those who
[1:02:58] believe
[1:03:00] i
[1:03:00] am a believer i don't care what the rest
[1:03:02] of me says amen all right
[1:03:05] now i'm bringing the rest of me under
[1:03:08] control
[1:03:09] so that it can't have an argument on
[1:03:12] whether i'm a believer or not it's just
[1:03:15] gonna have to fall in line guess what it
[1:03:17] becomes a prisoner yeah a man
[1:03:20] a prisoner
[1:03:22] yeah that's why you can say be quiet
[1:03:25] i ain't feeding you today
[1:03:28] you have no chance you you've got a life
[1:03:31] sentence and you ain't getting out
[1:03:35] that's the old nature all right we've
[1:03:37] got to destroy that
[1:03:38] all right
[1:03:39] i'm going to turn the corner
[1:03:43] i'm gonna go over to the tent meeting
[1:03:44] now
[1:03:45] still with me
[1:03:47] i don't mean to wear you out you're good
[1:03:49] okay
[1:03:50] now
[1:03:52] how about you well i'd say well open
[1:03:54] your bibles but
[1:03:56] i know it doesn't always work so
[1:03:58] but i'm going to turn to a couple of
[1:03:59] scriptures that i gave the brothers i
[1:04:01] was going to read revelations uh uh 3 14
[1:04:04] through 20 which is the laodicean age
[1:04:06] maybe i will you got your finger still
[1:04:08] there on late on
[1:04:10] on revelations 3.
[1:04:12] all right
[1:04:14] now now the sixth age
[1:04:17] is important
[1:04:19] because if you read
[1:04:21] the philadelphian church age the sixth
[1:04:24] church age which you and i because a lot
[1:04:25] of people think well i wasn't in the
[1:04:27] sixth church age oh don't tell me you're
[1:04:29] not passing through the stature of a
[1:04:30] perfect man and you have to get to the
[1:04:32] sixth stage of that stature and that
[1:04:35] sixth stage is represented right here
[1:04:39] you have to get to the stage where you
[1:04:41] see an open door because you kept his
[1:04:43] word you kept his name you kept
[1:04:45] everything you could keep that's your
[1:04:47] stepping stone to the seventh amen
[1:04:50] and guess what the number seven
[1:04:52] represents
[1:04:53] completion you get to the seventh stage
[1:04:57] of god's plan
[1:05:00] and you're almost there amen brother
[1:05:03] right so watch this
[1:05:06] under the angel of the church of the
[1:05:07] laodiceans write these things saith the
[1:05:09] amen the faithful and true witness the
[1:05:10] beginning of the creation
[1:05:12] oh we're back to the beginning he said
[1:05:14] and from the beginning it was not so i
[1:05:17] know thy works that thou art neither
[1:05:19] cold nor hot i would thou work cold or
[1:05:21] hot so then because they are lukewarm
[1:05:24] see that's somebody that's
[1:05:25] yeah yeah i can't make up my mind i say
[1:05:30] make your decision
[1:05:31] and go all the way brother
[1:05:34] okay i will spew thee out of my mouth
[1:05:39] because thou sayest i am rich oh
[1:05:44] look at the day we live in don't you see
[1:05:46] it
[1:05:47] and increase with goods and have need of
[1:05:50] nothing and knoweth not that thou art
[1:05:52] wretched and miserable and poor and
[1:05:53] blind and naked
[1:05:55] i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
[1:05:57] in the fire that thou mayest be rich in
[1:05:59] white raiment that thou mayest be
[1:06:01] clothed and that the shame of thy
[1:06:03] nakedness did not appear and anoint
[1:06:05] thine eyes with thy salve that thou
[1:06:07] mayest see man the philadelphia church
[1:06:10] agents got it going on
[1:06:12] laodicean looks like a sick
[1:06:16] dog but you got to get from one to the
[1:06:19] other
[1:06:20] sure
[1:06:22] this this is the part i like
[1:06:25] how many believes god loves them amen
[1:06:28] say amen amen then i rebuke
[1:06:33] and jason
[1:06:34] oh no oh no he's a god of love he
[1:06:37] wouldn't dare spank me they're sending
[1:06:39] me to the corner
[1:06:41] you don't know the god then that's right
[1:06:42] that we serve
[1:06:44] because if he loves you he rebukes and
[1:06:46] chases you why because of the fall
[1:06:48] brothers and sisters because of the
[1:06:50] condition we're in because of the state
[1:06:52] of things
[1:06:54] all right
[1:06:55] because we're dying
[1:06:57] he loves us
[1:06:59] so there's a rebuke and a chastening and
[1:07:01] he says be zealous therefore and do what
[1:07:04] this is why god loved david amen david
[1:07:08] did lots of things wrong he had a guy
[1:07:10] killed he had a guide of people carrying
[1:07:13] the ark that was wrong in a cart that
[1:07:14] was wrong
[1:07:19] and when usaid died oh my goodness
[1:07:23] what did i do
[1:07:25] and he repented yes he did and that's
[1:07:28] why god said you're a man after my own
[1:07:30] heart i sure love you king david get up
[1:07:34] because i'm gonna raise up
[1:07:36] a throne yes yes
[1:07:39] and it's gonna be called the throne of
[1:07:41] david yes it is amen and look at the
[1:07:43] things david did wrong oh david had his
[1:07:45] mighty men in it
[1:07:47] but he made mistakes
[1:07:50] he's an example for you and me
[1:07:53] amen
[1:07:54] i'm not putting down my sword
[1:07:56] just cause david no
[1:07:59] fell on his face
[1:08:01] i'm not putting down my sword because i
[1:08:03] fell on mine absolutely i'm gonna get up
[1:08:05] and keep on fighting the good
[1:08:08] fight all right
[1:08:11] okay let's keep reading
[1:08:13] behold verse 20 i stand at the door
[1:08:17] and knock watch if any man hear my voice
[1:08:20] and open the door okay i'm gonna stop
[1:08:23] so the prophet of god gives us an
[1:08:25] indication of what's going on here he
[1:08:27] refers us to a painting
[1:08:30] remember
[1:08:31] is it here in the room
[1:08:34] got that painting on the wall here
[1:08:35] that's okay
[1:08:36] you guys all know that it was a painting
[1:08:38] done by a famous painter and the when
[1:08:41] the art critic came and said but it's a
[1:08:42] nice painting but you forgot something
[1:08:44] yeah right
[1:08:45] he said what are you talking about he
[1:08:47] said look there's no knob they called it
[1:08:50] a latch then there's no latch on the
[1:08:52] outside of the door
[1:08:54] oh i painted it that way
[1:08:57] really how come because you've got to
[1:08:59] open it from the inside amen and as we
[1:09:02] all know by code when you have a front
[1:09:05] door
[1:09:07] it opens in why so you don't knock
[1:09:09] everybody off the porch
[1:09:12] seriously a retired carpenter i should
[1:09:14] know that
[1:09:16] it opens in so if he's on the outside
[1:09:19] knocking and there's no knob or latch
[1:09:22] no keyhole he's expecting
[1:09:28] anybody home
[1:09:30] there's no doorbell
[1:09:32] he's knocking yeah
[1:09:33] and the prophet of god told us that he
[1:09:35] was knocking the most pathetic picture
[1:09:38] he said
[1:09:39] in the bible
[1:09:41] was jesus christ listen now he wasn't
[1:09:44] outside of the presbyterian church

[1:09:49] he wasn't outside the baptist church or
[1:09:52] the or the orthodox church or even the
[1:09:54] catholic church yep he was outside of

[1:10:11] brother wayden i didn't want it to take
[1:10:12] a long time
[1:10:18] okay so i'll cut to the chase a little
[1:10:21] bit okay
[1:10:22] so we have an open door
[1:10:24] which is a door that's unlocked
[1:10:27] between the sixth and the seventh h

[1:10:33] this is unlocked
[1:10:35] to whosoever will
[1:10:37] okay
[1:10:38] but in order for the door to be open i
[1:10:41] said it was unlocked
[1:10:43] but in order for the message of the hour
[1:10:45] to be opened now
[1:10:47] we're in the laodicean church age he's
[1:10:50] knocking on the door expecting you yes
[1:10:53] that's right amen open
[1:10:56] and let him in
[1:10:58] and once he gets in there we're told
[1:10:59] that you know if you're if you're real
[1:11:01] grumpy
[1:11:03] ah
[1:11:04] you can have a seat
[1:11:07] but if you're real friendly

[1:11:12] the fridge help yourself yep
[1:11:14] take your shoes off
[1:11:16] watch now wait a minute now
[1:11:18] so now they got into the living room in
[1:11:20] the kitchen oh but don't go down the
[1:11:22] hallway
[1:11:23] i haven't made the bed today yeah
[1:11:25] pillows aren't all fluffed up doesn't
[1:11:26] look good
[1:11:28] i know the ladies
[1:11:30] honey what are you doing all that i
[1:11:31] don't know nobody comes in our bedroom
[1:11:32] yeah i know what this is this pillow's
[1:11:34] all got to be right here
[1:11:36] gotta look good
[1:11:38] why
[1:11:38] in case he comes in yeah not literally
[1:11:43] get your mind out of the gutter i'm
[1:11:44] talking about the church now i'm talking
[1:11:46] about the bride
[1:11:48] but the prophet of god tells us that's
[1:11:50] where a connection is made you don't
[1:11:53] just let him in the living room after
[1:11:55] you open the door
[1:11:56] three kinds of believers
[1:11:59] body spirit and soul living room kitchen
[1:12:02] bedroom
[1:12:04] you're a three-room house
[1:12:06] is that right oh man
[1:12:09] i'm having a good time
[1:12:11] i'll tell you why because you don't
[1:12:12] realize it but things are just spinning
[1:12:13] around inside of me that
[1:12:15] but i'm gonna get to the door
[1:12:18] of the little room
[1:12:19] that's all i'm gonna get to
[1:12:21] okay now in order for me to
[1:12:24] uh make sure you understand i am not
[1:12:26] interpreting what we call the tent
[1:12:28] vision
[1:12:30] but i want you to also hear me that in
[1:12:33] my lifetime
[1:12:35] some of the things that brother branham
[1:12:37] says
[1:12:38] in the progression of the tent vision
[1:12:41] have happened in my life some of them
[1:12:44] happened in his
[1:12:45] the first part of it
[1:12:47] mexico city
[1:12:48] you say brother uh you're stretching it
[1:12:50] now
[1:12:52] i won't be stretching it if it happens
[1:12:54] to you
[1:12:55] because this is interpreted by it coming
[1:12:58] to pass that's the reason why people are
[1:13:01] disputing and and oh no it means this
[1:13:04] and it means that and then
[1:13:06] it means exactly what it says
[1:13:09] amen but it's a parable
[1:13:12] right it's an allegory
[1:13:14] it's a metaphor
[1:13:16] it stands for some that's why i wanted
[1:13:17] you to see oh my bones they stare at me
[1:13:19] david's bones weren't staring at him
[1:13:21] and literally
[1:13:23] jesus bones were not literally staring
[1:13:25] at him even though they were probably
[1:13:26] sticking out of his
[1:13:28] his rib cage you could see it she knew
[1:13:29] i'm saying
[1:13:30] he was referring to that valley
[1:13:33] of dry bones
[1:13:35] they were staring
[1:13:36] at him they were gawking at him while he
[1:13:39] was hanging on the cross you see david
[1:13:42] was speaking
[1:13:44] allegory
[1:13:49] in a metaphor
[1:13:51] that's what this is
[1:13:54] and if a prophet didn't interpret it
[1:13:57] then it has to come to pass
[1:14:00] in order for it to be
[1:14:02] understood
[1:14:05] right
[1:14:06] now you say well i don't see that coming
[1:14:07] to pass in my life oh you just knuckled
[1:14:10] down a little bit and you see this
[1:14:12] coming to pass in your life watch this
[1:14:14] and i'll give you this part and then
[1:14:15] i'll move on quickly so in this
[1:14:18] series of events brother branham talking
[1:14:21] about starting out he was in the room
[1:14:24] literally with his wife and his and his
[1:14:27] wife and him were talking and he was
[1:14:29] talking about being hung
[1:14:32] for fifteen thousand dollars
[1:14:36] that he had to pay back
[1:14:38] and he believed he needed to do it
[1:14:40] before he went back out on the field
[1:14:41] because he said if god sent me god would
[1:14:43] take care of it and he left a meeting in
[1:14:45] california and he was intending on
[1:14:47] telling his family all the way through
[1:14:49] all the states while they were driving
[1:14:51] back to indiana
[1:14:53] i'm going to tell him when we get to
[1:14:54] arizona i'm going to tell him when we
[1:14:56] get to the state line i'm going to tell
[1:14:57] him when we get here i'm going to tell
[1:14:59] him no no no no no
[1:15:02] was he embarrassed
[1:15:04] did he not know how to say what he
[1:15:05] wanted to say
[1:15:07] did he think it would hurt their feeling
[1:15:08] i don't know i don't know those things
[1:15:10] all i know is he waited until he got
[1:15:13] back home and then he began to tell them
[1:15:16] what happened and he was talking with
[1:15:18] his wife meda
[1:15:21] and as soon as he said something that
[1:15:24] triggered
[1:15:25] he started to go off
[1:15:27] into a vision now i'm sure he was
[1:15:28] standing there but he started to go off
[1:15:30] in a vision and i happen to know by
[1:15:32] reading enough of the message to know
[1:15:33] that sister media recognized and billy
[1:15:36] paul recognized immediately when the
[1:15:38] angel of the lord was coming near
[1:15:41] and they would begin to back away
[1:15:44] why because
[1:15:45] brother branham was being taken he was
[1:15:47] physically right there oh yeah
[1:15:49] but he himself was being taken as a
[1:15:52] prophet
[1:15:53] into a vision and he began to see just
[1:15:55] like you watched television he began to
[1:15:57] see this series of events or event
[1:15:59] whatever is taking place like when he's
[1:16:00] discerning people
[1:16:02] right did i say that he
[1:16:04] ever heard him say that anything is that
[1:16:06] true
[1:16:07] because he's saying what he sees he's
[1:16:10] not absolutely cognizant
[1:16:14] of those things
[1:16:15] okay
[1:16:16] so he's he's going into this vision and
[1:16:19] i'm i'm paraphrasing it so it'll
[1:16:20] accelerate
[1:16:22] and he gets to this spot
[1:16:25] where he's going to go fishing
[1:16:27] everybody in here probably knows this
[1:16:29] but i want to use this
[1:16:31] to get to the next
[1:16:32] point if it's okay
[1:16:38] and he and he talks about in the message
[1:16:40] being led of the holy spirit i have
[1:16:42] almost every one of what i'm here what
[1:16:43] is the vision these were all in 1956.
[1:16:46] now he does talk about this in the seals
[1:16:49] but this is right after he began to
[1:16:52] become involved in the recognition of
[1:16:55] what these things meant now at first he
[1:16:57] didn't know
[1:16:58] he didn't even know what the little
[1:17:00] brown children are purling the wagon
[1:17:02] right
[1:17:02] later on he recognized that that was the
[1:17:05] fulfillment of that part of this vision
[1:17:09] when he went and preached in mexico city
[1:17:10] and they got rained down they tried to
[1:17:12] take him here and take him there and all
[1:17:13] kinds of things happened okay
[1:17:16] now
[1:17:18] i'm gonna let me put this aside
[1:17:21] let me go to where he is fishing are you
[1:17:23] okay with that
[1:17:25] all right
[1:17:28] the angel of the lord tells him i'm
[1:17:29] going to teach you how to fish
[1:17:31] i want you to think about something now
[1:17:34] this is william branham
[1:17:38] a fisher of men
[1:17:39] and a really good fisherman at one time
[1:17:43] i i saw the fish and i was told that it
[1:17:46] was the world
[1:17:49] record
[1:17:50] rainbow trout that he caught and they
[1:17:52] taxidermy for him
[1:17:54] i said so so watch i'm saying all this
[1:17:56] because he's a fisherman
[1:17:59] but the angel lord says now i'm going to
[1:18:01] show you how to fish
[1:18:03] brother brown says i know how to fish
[1:18:05] yeah but watch
[1:18:07] he says uh
[1:18:10] hang on
[1:18:12] bear with me
[1:18:17] i showed up at a lake
[1:18:19] i walked on i passed the ministers and
[1:18:21] then i walked a little further and i
[1:18:23] came into a great panoramic affair
[1:18:28] then i went further into the vision so
[1:18:31] you can go back and read all these
[1:18:32] things i'm skipping forward
[1:18:34] and when i did i was standing with a
[1:18:36] well you know a little baby shoe you've
[1:18:38] all heard this
[1:18:39] in one place he calls it a moccasin
[1:18:41] right okay
[1:18:42] and and i'm and i got this this shoe's
[1:18:44] got little bitty eyelets it's not a
[1:18:46] booty it's a shoe and i had a string in
[1:18:48] my hand and i was trying to lace this
[1:18:50] little eighth of an inch hole in this
[1:18:54] eyelet you know how small a little
[1:18:56] eyelet is in a baby shoe and i and i had
[1:18:58] a string in my hand and i was trying to
[1:18:59] lace this little eighth of an inch hole
[1:19:02] in this eyelet with about a half inch
[1:19:04] string about size my pinky it ain't
[1:19:06] gonna work
[1:19:11] okay
[1:19:12] just working fervently trying to push
[1:19:14] that string through
[1:19:16] now remember brothers and sisters i'm
[1:19:17] telling you all this because this is a
[1:19:19] metaphor it's a parable
[1:19:21] it's an allegory he doesn't he's seeing
[1:19:24] it he's explaining what he sees but it
[1:19:26] represents something else
[1:19:29] what it represents is him trying to
[1:19:31] force that little that big string
[1:19:34] through that little hole the angel says
[1:19:36] you cannot teach pentecostal babies
[1:19:40] supernatural things now he didn't say he
[1:19:42] couldn't teach the pentecostals he said
[1:19:44] pentecostal babies
[1:19:46] they needed to grow up
[1:19:48] they needed to get bigger eyelets in
[1:19:49] their shoes that string needed to get
[1:19:52] smaller which if you follow it along it
[1:19:54] does watch now
[1:19:56] he said
[1:19:57] he said uh
[1:19:59] and
[1:20:00] i i heard something whipping around whoa
[1:20:07] okay
[1:20:08] you're using the wrong end of the string
[1:20:10] the angel told him
[1:20:12] brothers i'm going back between three
[1:20:13] messages so you try to keep up with me
[1:20:16] and i recognize that voice
[1:20:19] you can't teach baby supernatural things
[1:20:21] you're using the wrong end of the string
[1:20:23] and i look down at the end of the string
[1:20:24] lying on the floor a great big pile of
[1:20:26] string and it was laced down to a nice
[1:20:28] eighth of an inch so the other end of
[1:20:30] the pile of string was the right size
[1:20:33] to go
[1:20:35] in this shoe
[1:20:40] it was laced down to a nice save in an
[1:20:42] inch so it would go through the hole and
[1:20:44] i said i understand and as i reached to
[1:20:47] pick up the string see so he he came to
[1:20:49] an understanding of what it meant he
[1:20:52] began to pick up the string and he was
[1:20:54] taken again
[1:20:58] that's over
[1:21:01] now you mark this down he says watch it
[1:21:04] come to pass
[1:21:05] as i started to reach down i was gone
[1:21:07] again then when i come to
[1:21:10] i was standing by the side of a
[1:21:13] beautiful lake something like your lake
[1:21:15] here who's preaching in chicago
[1:21:17] in the summertime when it's pretty and
[1:21:18] green and there were fishermen all
[1:21:20] around the lake and they were fishing
[1:21:21] but they were catching small fishes
[1:21:25] and i looked out into the lake and those
[1:21:27] great big beautiful rainbow trout out
[1:21:30] there now remember
[1:21:33] he caught the world record rainbow trout
[1:21:36] but in this vision he seized these great
[1:21:39] beautiful rainbow trout and he said i
[1:21:41] know
[1:21:42] this is efficient he says it but i can't
[1:21:46] understand those trout yeah come on all
[1:21:49] right
[1:21:50] amen
[1:21:52] he's not here nope right
[1:21:55] of course he can't understand those
[1:21:57] trout
[1:21:59] because the revelation is progressive
[1:22:02] and it keeps moving it doesn't stop and
[1:22:04] he got to a point where god took him
[1:22:07] home right
[1:22:08] amen sorry brother you'll read all the
[1:22:10] stories he said about it you will never
[1:22:12] find one place where he caught one
[1:22:16] of those rainbow trout
[1:22:18] and he's a fisherman
[1:22:20] and the angel of the lord told him how
[1:22:22] to catch him
[1:22:24] but where did he go wrong
[1:22:26] does anybody remember he tried to
[1:22:29] explain it all right ma'am yeah
[1:22:32] that's why i'm not trying to explain
[1:22:33] this to you no matter what you think
[1:22:35] there you go because i can't
[1:22:37] it's revealed by revelation
[1:22:40] it's just like the seventh seal
[1:22:42] you can't explain the seventh seal to
[1:22:44] anybody why because it's silent
[1:22:46] amen
[1:22:48] is that right
[1:22:50] can i ask you a question
[1:22:57] i know you're all thinking well some of
[1:22:58] you are sleeping but i know you're all
[1:23:00] thinking
[1:23:02] but i don't hear a thing
[1:23:06] so when the seventh seal was open it was
[1:23:08] silent
[1:23:09] because it represented something that
[1:23:11] was silent right
[1:23:15] brother branham said you know all the
[1:23:16] noise that's made out there try to hear
[1:23:18] the earth turning at 20 something where
[1:23:21] whatever miles per hour it's spinning
[1:23:23] around some of you students probably
[1:23:24] know
[1:23:25] sure you can't hear a thing
[1:23:27] and this thing's moving
[1:23:29] if it wasn't for gravity we'd be flung
[1:23:31] off of
[1:23:32] it but you can't hear it
[1:23:35] there's something else
[1:23:38] that you cannot hear
[1:23:41] the mind of god
[1:23:45] but it's represented yes it is in the
[1:23:47] manifestation
[1:23:49] of its immense amen you're with me
[1:23:51] that's where you and i come in that's
[1:23:53] why this is all becoming so real to me
[1:23:56] you might think well you're crazy okay
[1:23:59] you know yeah i've been called worse
[1:24:01] that's right
[1:24:02] listen so now i'm gonna get around i did
[1:24:05] the rainbow trout thing you can read all
[1:24:07] that there's so much in it all right
[1:24:10] now he gets to the tent
[1:24:14] and the other progressive
[1:24:16] dimension in this vision
[1:24:20] he says and oh all the people they they
[1:24:22] they look like they went around the tent
[1:24:24] and out of city blocker more a great
[1:24:26] line of people and they were all
[1:24:27] standing around there with their prayer
[1:24:29] card and i just
[1:24:30] then i seen a woman in an ambulance
[1:24:32] stretcher was laying and man behind her
[1:24:34] was standing on crutches so they were
[1:24:35] standing there waiting for their turn
[1:24:37] there was a lady taking down their names
[1:24:42] that never happened at one of running
[1:24:43] pants campaigns
[1:24:46] and then there was a canvas
[1:24:48] stretched here
[1:24:50] that no one could get around that tent
[1:24:54] you ain't getting in no other way
[1:24:57] you're coming through the door or you
[1:25:00] ain't coming at all
[1:25:05] i want you to watch this and listen how
[1:25:07] it is now you watched the difference
[1:25:09] then i heard that whipping
[1:25:12] like that always every time we have a
[1:25:15] healing service that's just what happens
[1:25:17] that's the way it always sounded it
[1:25:19] sounded that way in the bush that time
[1:25:22] when i heard it
[1:25:24] moses heard the same thing see and i
[1:25:26] looked and here went that real soft
[1:25:28] light moving away from me
[1:25:33] and went down and went into that little
[1:25:35] building
[1:25:37] we went from a tent
[1:25:38] to a little building do you know that
[1:25:41] brother branham used the first five
[1:25:43] verses of psalms 27 for the message the
[1:25:47] rapture
[1:25:48] and when he got to the fifth verse he
[1:25:51] talks about the fifth verse in psalms is
[1:25:53] pavilions and tabernacle yeah
[1:25:56] yeah sure so brother wade i i got my
[1:25:59] little strong's concordance out there
[1:26:01] and i said i'm gonna see what the
[1:26:02] definition is of pavilion i know what a
[1:26:05] tabernacle is
[1:26:06] a tabernacle is a stretched
[1:26:09] skin yeah
[1:26:12] amen
[1:26:13] are you a tabernacle yes
[1:26:15] oh i'm a tabernacle you're a tabernacle
[1:26:17] whether you like it or not you're also a
[1:26:18] tent right amen what is a tent
[1:26:21] it's a mobile
[1:26:23] shelter
[1:26:25] without a permanent foundation held down
[1:26:29] by stakes and lines that's what the
[1:26:31] dictionary says
[1:26:34] do you know who else was a tent yeah
[1:26:37] abraham
[1:26:38] he was wandering around
[1:26:40] looking for a city whose builder and
[1:26:43] maker
[1:26:44] was not man and he'd move his tent from
[1:26:47] place to place and people would say
[1:26:49] abraham you're out of your mind
[1:26:52] you say god's talking to you you left a
[1:26:55] listen now a good job he was in the tech

[1:28:03] [Laughter]
[1:28:04] i like it yeah all right i'll come to an
[1:28:06] end because i know this is long and
[1:28:10] watch now
[1:28:12] that little building
[1:28:13] he says now i'm in another and there's
[1:28:16] there's something different between the
[1:28:17] light and the angel
[1:28:19] because he was still here with me and
[1:28:21] the light had went into the building and
[1:28:22] this angel still speaking behind me
[1:28:24] which is a big man
[1:28:28] said i will meet you
[1:28:30] in there
[1:28:33] so then i said
[1:28:35] i don't understand why in there
[1:28:37] this is the prophet yep right
[1:28:40] he said watch and this woman went and
[1:28:43] she come out of there uh uh
[1:28:45] on the ambulance stretcher she was
[1:28:47] pushing the stretcher out the other side
[1:28:48] so she went in on a stretcher and
[1:28:51] down the street she went right
[1:28:54] okay and the lady
[1:28:57] and she said the lady asked her
[1:29:00] what happened she said i don't know
[1:29:04] you getting this i don't know what do
[1:29:06] you mean you don't know you went in the
[1:29:07] room on a stretcher and you're pushing
[1:29:09] this treasure out the other side what do
[1:29:10] you mean you don't know what happened
[1:29:13] this is that third pull amen yes see
[1:29:16] that's what he says he's saying it all
[1:29:17] along in different places and nobody
[1:29:19] will know nothing about it
[1:29:21] but brothers and sisters the reason for
[1:29:23] that is the devil can't get it no it's
[1:29:26] happening in you and me and we're like
[1:29:28] huh yeah right man
[1:29:30] i mean i don't get it
[1:29:33] but my question to you is is it
[1:29:35] happening
[1:29:37] of course we don't get it
[1:29:39] we can't explain it but something on the
[1:29:42] inside is working on the outside oh
[1:29:47] what a change he has rocked
[1:29:52] this is going to change our mortal
[1:29:53] bodies not my ministry not what i'm
[1:29:55] preaching but what the revelation of his
[1:29:58] word is
[1:30:00] and you've got to want to stay with it
[1:30:02] even don't worry whether you understand
[1:30:04] it or not they had no idea who was
[1:30:07] talking to abraham
[1:30:10] abraham you're nuts
[1:30:14] sarah his church
[1:30:18] well i'm married and he's my lord so
[1:30:22] okay i don't understand i had air
[1:30:24] conditioning a washer and a dryer a
[1:30:26] refrigerator i had all this stuff
[1:30:29] and you're dragging me around
[1:30:34] do you know why
[1:30:35] character yeah
[1:30:38] we need a little character
[1:30:40] and when you need some character he's
[1:30:41] gonna drag
[1:30:43] you around
[1:30:44] tell you get up and go
[1:30:46] okay
[1:30:47] i got that
[1:30:48] i'm good
[1:30:50] okay
[1:30:51] now listen now i'll get to the end of it
[1:30:56] i know somebody's laughing yeah right
[1:31:02] what happened she said i've been in this
[1:31:05] stretcher said i've been down in bed for
[1:31:07] years and here come the man out packing
[1:31:10] his crutches see because another guy
[1:31:11] went in after if you read the other
[1:31:13] parts and they asked him what he said he
[1:31:15] didn't know he was coming to the
[1:31:17] platform to testify
[1:31:19] oh he was coming to the platform to
[1:31:20] testify and somehow he ends up on one
[1:31:23] side of this little room and goes
[1:31:24] through and comes out the other side
[1:31:25] says i have no clue
[1:31:29] that's happening right now whether you
[1:31:30] realize or not
[1:31:32] because i know people go high and got no
[1:31:33] clue
[1:31:34] what this man is talking about
[1:31:38] i don't have to have one either
[1:31:40] that's the beauty of the whole thing
[1:31:42] stay
[1:31:43] with
[1:31:44] the word amen because this is god's word
[1:31:48] and there ain't none of us all put
[1:31:50] together gonna comprehend god right amen
[1:31:54] but if we remain obedient
[1:31:57] and chaste
[1:31:59] and subjected to god's word eventually
[1:32:02] it's going to become
[1:32:04] the wheel
[1:32:06] in the middle
[1:32:07] of the wheel you think what i'm telling
[1:32:09] you is crazy i challenge you to read
[1:32:12] ezekiel chapter one
[1:32:19] it goes from one dimension to another
[1:32:22] from one vision to another from one
[1:32:25] metaphor and parable and allegory to
[1:32:27] another
[1:32:31] watch this
[1:32:33] sorry i'm preaching too much you're good
[1:32:34] no
[1:32:35] and i don't now watch what the prophet
[1:32:37] says he was coming to the platform to
[1:32:39] testify and brother branham says to the
[1:32:40] angel i don't understand that
[1:32:43] in there yeah
[1:32:47] you know why
[1:32:48] because that part of the pyramid wasn't
[1:32:49] written on
[1:32:50] he interpreted the outside of the
[1:32:53] pyramid and when he drove that crowbar
[1:32:56] that sharp object in the top of that
[1:32:59] rock that cap rock and popped it off
[1:33:01] what did he tell the people
[1:33:03] look
[1:33:04] on this and you can imagine if there was
[1:33:07] no writing in their cis and you looked
[1:33:08] in there and
[1:33:10] yeah what exactly right
[1:33:12] he said most of the people
[1:33:15] did not do
[1:33:17] what he told them to do
[1:33:20] here's what i believe
[1:33:22] you stand and look down in there long
[1:33:25] enough by obedience and there will come
[1:33:28] writing amen yes there will come words
[1:33:31] there will come recognition there will
[1:33:34] come revelation out there and you go
[1:33:35] whoa man i never saw that before right
[1:33:38] you know why you never saw it before
[1:33:39] because you never looked long enough
[1:33:41] right all right all right you gotta stay
[1:33:43] with it brothers and sisters you can't
[1:33:46] let it
[1:33:47] you know
[1:33:48] it's got to become your driving force in
[1:33:51] your life no you don't have to become a
[1:33:53] religious nut that's right
[1:33:55] you just have to become obedient
[1:33:58] because obedience is better than
[1:34:00] sacrifice
[1:34:02] sacrifice and offerings thou what is not
[1:34:05] but a body amen hostile prepared me
[1:34:10] you're
[1:34:11] that
[1:34:12] you're part of it i believe that yeah
[1:34:15] i don't understand that in there and
[1:34:17] watch he's always scriptural see brother
[1:34:19] branham now the angel is taking him back
[1:34:22] to the scripture he said do did not our
[1:34:25] lord say when thou prayest be not like
[1:34:29] the hypocrites
[1:34:30] that like to make a show
[1:34:34] that wouldn't have been the third pool
[1:34:36] because it's not a public show he said
[1:34:37] enter into the secret closet and when
[1:34:40] you've done so
[1:34:42] close the
[1:34:45] hey door
[1:34:46] hey
[1:34:47] hang on
[1:34:48] i'm stopping
[1:34:50] oh i'm stopping but wait until i get to
[1:34:52] the part i'm stopping at
[1:35:05] this got me
[1:35:07] you all think that you know like oh man
[1:35:09] gee wow
[1:35:10] this just comes to me i mean i was
[1:35:13] traveling over here and i was looking
[1:35:16] for something
[1:35:17] else
[1:35:20] and i said oh
[1:35:22] i see the door and the vision you can
[1:35:25] read the other versions
[1:35:27] i just wanted to read you the one that
[1:35:29] got them all here we could take hours we
[1:35:31] don't need to
[1:35:32] go back and look for yourself
[1:35:34] but watch what he says in revelations
[1:35:37] chapter 4
[1:35:39] part 3.
[1:35:43] and these cherubims oh hold it
[1:35:46] you well you
[1:35:49] i'm going to genesis brothers
[1:35:54] i'll tell you it gets hot
[1:35:56] you want to get into the tin fission you
[1:35:58] go to exodus where it talks about
[1:36:01] the tent
[1:36:02] of meeting
[1:36:04] it didn't say tent meeting it's a tent
[1:36:06] of
[1:36:07] meeting the tent of the meeting yeah
[1:36:10] okay
[1:36:11] i'm gonna take you to genesis because i
[1:36:12] ain't got time for that one
[1:36:14] i'll get that when i get home
[1:36:16] listen now
[1:36:19] genesis 3
[1:36:20] starting at 22 and the lord god said
[1:36:22] behold the man has become as one of us
[1:36:26] to know good and evil and now lest he
[1:36:29] put forth his hand and take also of the
[1:36:32] tree of life and eat and live forever
[1:36:34] therefore the lord god sent him forth
[1:36:36] from the garden of eden to till the
[1:36:39] ground from whence he was taken so he
[1:36:41] drove out the man and he placed at the
[1:36:44] east of the garden of eden cherubims
[1:36:48] and a flaming sword which turned every
[1:36:51] way to keep the way of the tree
[1:36:55] of life
[1:36:56] oh i'm having a good time
[1:37:00] door
[1:37:02] any means of approach admittance or
[1:37:04] access any gateway
[1:37:09] marking an entrance or exit from one
[1:37:11] place or condition to another listen
[1:37:14] careful comes from a greek from a from
[1:37:16] an old english word dor meaning gate
[1:37:21] wait a minute it doesn't say gate in in
[1:37:23] in genesis uh 3 down here in verse 24
[1:37:27] the prophet said gate
[1:37:28] but watch this
[1:37:30] it says and a flaming sword which turned
[1:37:34] every way
[1:37:36] to keep the way of the tree of life
[1:37:40] who is the door who is the truth who is
[1:37:43] the life who is the way that's right
[1:37:46] amen wait a minute the word gate
[1:37:51] it means a breach
[1:37:53] or a hole
[1:37:56] wait a minute i i was having a ball you
[1:37:58] can imagine
[1:38:00] the word way
[1:38:04] and you say
[1:38:05] no way
[1:38:07] i say way
[1:38:11] my wife knows
[1:38:13] amen
[1:38:14] oh away
[1:38:16] it's a passage or channel
[1:38:19] from the origins for the word road
[1:38:22] thoroughfare or highway
[1:38:27] it's a passage
[1:38:28] that's right you want to go
[1:38:31] where god wants us to go
[1:38:34] then you've got to meet the challenge
[1:38:39] and these cherubims first mentioned
[1:38:42] was placed at the east gate of the
[1:38:44] garden
[1:38:45] going four ways
[1:38:48] i should have made
[1:38:50] that a little different from that
[1:38:51] brother brandon referring to a drawing
[1:38:54] from a little different than that i
[1:38:56] can't do justified to god's orders and
[1:38:57] things like that but so that you'll know
[1:38:59] what i mean there's the garden of eden
[1:39:02] he's referring to a drawing and this is
[1:39:05] the gate right here
[1:39:07] you're with me cause i'm closing
[1:39:10] right there's an open door we found out
[1:39:13] that it's just unlocked
[1:39:16] then he's knocking on the door
[1:39:20] to your heart
[1:39:21] and you have to open it and it opens
[1:39:25] this way
[1:39:26] is that right
[1:39:28] watch what you have to do now
[1:39:31] watch the door
[1:39:34] on the ten vision
[1:39:38] you shut that door
[1:39:40] in the tent vision listen careful man
[1:39:43] there's the garden of eden and this is
[1:39:45] the gate right here
[1:39:47] it opens up here it swings
[1:39:50] out
[1:39:54] it swings
[1:39:56] out you know how when a gate swings out
[1:39:58] you got to pull on it
[1:40:00] and then you got to walk through it
[1:40:02] and you got to turn click
[1:40:05] and latch it so the neighbor's dogs
[1:40:06] don't get in and your cats don't get out
[1:40:12] that's what's going on amen
[1:40:15] that gate
[1:40:17] that was placed in the garden of eden
[1:40:20] is now
[1:40:22] freely entered
[1:40:25] by those
[1:40:26] who have invited him in
[1:40:29] by opening the door inward and traveling
[1:40:33] with him through their three-room house
[1:40:37] till you get to the gate now that gate
[1:40:40] doesn't open inward it swings
[1:40:44] out
[1:40:46] there's a reason for it
[1:40:49] because he wants you
[1:40:51] to open
[1:40:53] that gate
[1:40:55] it's a challenge oh no brother you don't
[1:40:57] understand i see angels with flaming
[1:40:59] swords yeah me too yeah but guess what
[1:41:02] they're doing
[1:41:03] they're not keeping
[1:41:05] the way
[1:41:07] of the gate any longer because of
[1:41:08] calvary they're asking you to come and
[1:41:12] open the gate but it requires effort on
[1:41:16] your part because it opens outward
[1:41:18] not inward
[1:41:19] that's where we're at that's what is
[1:41:22] going on
[1:41:23] in the world we live in today and
[1:41:25] brothers and sisters
[1:41:26] it's okay with me if you dispute it or
[1:41:28] you don't agree with it but i challenge
[1:41:30] you to try it in your life
[1:41:33] and see then watch if this
[1:41:36] series
[1:41:39] of events
[1:41:40] that he spoke of
[1:41:42] about this vision don't become
[1:41:45] your harvest
[1:41:48] because it's going to require
[1:41:51] see
[1:41:52] the definition to be fulfilled
[1:41:55] it's up to you and me
[1:41:56] oh no brother we're waiting for the
[1:41:58] reapers to come i hear this all the time
