CA all right let's turn to Second Peter reader good morning everyone good morning good morning second Peter chapter 1 everybody had a good week so so far it's only been one day part of a day morning this is the first day of the week you know okay second Peter chapter 1 all right second Peter chapter 1 now let's just go ahead and start it verse three according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain to life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge to knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness God brotherly kindness brotherly kindness charity see remember there there's not any comma so it's just a continuation it's a you got to have one then stop got to have one then stop no it's a continuation all right you flow from one right into the other all right there's there's 90 different ingredients in the ocean okay but if you're not a scientist and you don't use a chemical uh way of doing things they're there right but it's called seawat there's 90 different Trace elements in the in sea water but without breaking them down it's just sea water it's just salt are all right but if you break same thing with this it's all the new birth being born again it's all the new birth we just got to break it down into the seven ads or seven elements to a statue of a perfect man and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to Virtue knowledge to knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you all right in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lackthe things is blind and cannot see a far off in other words you can't see Revelation right you know be up there where the eagle is and see a far off is blind and cannot see a far off and has forgotten we got to be reminded has forgotten all right that he was purged from his old sins all right so there's a purging time and I want to talk about that today a little bit and then next Sunday we'll get into sister Shepherd's dream and then the next Sunday I'll be here this coming Sunday Ginger I'll be here Ginger this this weekend let your husband do the preaching okay oh I see why that thing come off that's broke this thing when it fell it must have broke see that right there there's cable ties over there okay all right but anyway somebody said something about it being wobbly and awine cuz it's broke but we'll fix that but listen back to what we were talking about I Bob will be here March May the 10th I'm going flying to New Jersey so I'll be gone and um for that weekend so Bob will be here so but next weekend we'll bring up Sister Shepherd's dream but I want to read this quote here now look now these people are pet is saying how that we must be partakers of his divine nature must be now each one of us are trying to grow into the stature of God now that doesn't say statue statue doesn't move we're a stature that's height stature is the growth development all right statue is just a could be an idol could be all kind of things all right but a stature is a growth development or a height that we have to get to now after we get through the Seven Seals then at that time the sounding of the seven seal the loosening course we know what a seal is is to loose the ministry to loose Seven Seals and we'll see that right on the chart is loosing the message something that's sealed up then he talks about the key now he preached on that last Sunday the key to this whole thing is Faith the faith holds the key and the key is the scripture and Christ is the door so T Faith takes the little hinges of the scpt scripture and unlocks the glories of God glories and good of God out to his people see so it Faith holds the key that unlocks Christ to the people unlocks it revealed it so today he said we're going to take the same thing same key to unlock remember he had to take scripture he couldn't go back to a quote book that's right he was making the quotebook as he was preaching but he had no quotebook to go back to all he had if you'll notice in a lot of the videos I mean a lot of the pictures the Bible and the tablet that's where he had to get it from he had to get it from the scripture all right so it unlocks it and reveals it so today we're going to try to take that same key to unlock the way to become a virtuous Christian in the stature of God that and be a living Tabernacle for the Living God to dwell in he reveals himself three ways Pillar of Fire that was called the fatherhood remember in the Old Testament above God above us then that same God made manifest in Jesus Christ which he built a body made this body thirdly through the death of that body he Sanctified a church that he can dwell in so it's God above us God With Us and God in us the same God that's the reason it was called father son Holy Spirit not three Gods three officers one God they have only thought of that at the N Council we wouldn't have been all messed up if they hadn't if they had only thought of that we wouldn't have been all messed up see that's what we're trying to do now all that mess up that started back through the a that was back through the ages that's what brother brandham came to do he came to restore the faith of the fathers and to reveal the Seven Seals to show us the mysteries of God been hid from the foundation of the world now these Mysteries has been hid since the first age though cuz the first age had these virtues working in their life so anybody understand this is it's a great thing to have these virtues working in your life that's a requirement right but that's not what brother brand that wasn't his sole responsibility when he got here that's what he said that the the messenger of Malachi for do two things restore the hearts of the children to the fathers that's what the fathers had faith of the fathers right and then literally turn us back by the revelation of the Seven Seals which is this thing right here all right everybody got that that's this thing right here all right because you can be born again and not have all these virtues that's right right sure you you can be be born again and not have all these virtues cuz that's what happened down Through the Ages was that it wasn't taught and what did he say above this he said it has to be found in scripture so Peter had to put it in scripture and then you get Paul saying being born or Peter saying being born again then Paul saying I Die daily they're making they're making a a a um what's that Doctrine but they're making a a revelation known to the people back then that you're supposed to be all these things Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None go back to that and the different ones and and Paul you know watch Paul Walk he let that woman he let that woman that sorcerer follow him around and just pound on him and pound on him and somebody said Paul why don't you just rebuke the thing well why didn't he he might have had just a little bit of patience but see when the godliness came and the knowledge to know that it was God he turned a rebuked a woman why he couldn't do it till God told him brother Brown couldn't do things till God tell told him what to do you and I shouldn't do things till God tells us what to do now we don't have the office of a prophet where God speaks directly to us listen now with the conscious is together but he still speaks to us yes you understand what I'm saying yes brother Brown didn't know sometimes if he was in this world or in another world he was he was walking between Dimensions well now there's prophets in the five old Ministry but there was not a prophet like brother Brown where he could be just in direct contact with God cuz you know when sister M did what she did and slammed the door brother Bram said he didn't like that well you know that's probably not the only time he ever slammed she ever slammed a door she they were married for 20 something years you understand but God was present at that time talking to brother brandham and he had to direct his attention somewhere else that's why the Holy Spirit didn't like that it's not the holy and the Holy Spirit doesn't like if you get mad but still like that that really that really was a sign though to show that the third pool was in manifestation that even when we do mess up even when we do mess up like she did she messed up there was still a man there not William Brandon but a vessel that God could use to speak and say before the doctors touch the thing it's going to be gone okay same thing with you and I even though we do make mistakes and do make you know we we fumble the ball as it as they say there's still somebody not a prophet not a priest but God himself cuz when the mighty Angel come down I believe when when brother R stood there on the seal he was revealing Christ to us not William Brown to us he was revealing Christ but that man yielded himself so much to that and and you know what brother R said you stay under the spout long enough God will speak to you the same way and even on this this um message back before this I was just scrolling through it he went and sat down in the woods and he said I just sat there in the woods and said God what can you give me for my people and that's what Dad does and that's what I do I said God give me what you know what does the people need it's not my needs I can get up and make a statement or a or a good dissertation but it may be just for me yeah but I want something for the people I want you to be praying you going to get out of the service what you going to get out of the service cuz what you said before the service started that's right all right so we come expecting to see God not each other all right and then when we do that see that's what I think we've missed that now it's just forgive me but churches in the message are almost like denominational churches it's just a place to come and talk get together say you know have have some fellowship but it's kind of more worldly Fellowship than than anything but Fellowship around the word of God okay so that's what we're trying to do cuz brother brand said he said I'd sit there and say God what you give me for the people he said then I sit and listen that's our problem you think oh brother R he no he said I sat down at the tree let me see if I can find that I want him to say it I mean you say oh this is just for a prophit yeah it is but this is the way he got it now here it is yield yourself wait a minute here so for a days before we have a service I constantly pray go to the woods take in my pocket tell the wife I'm going squirrel hunting put a pencil and a tablet of paper in my pocket as soon as it gets loud enough to see or sitting against a tree somewhere hands up in the air saying Lord what can I do today what will you give me for your children then when I strike something that seems to burn down in other words something that won't go away something that just keeps keeps pounding at you you know and and I'm sure God saying hey these people need to know that they need to grow up in God and not be babies all right then when I strike something that seems to burn down comes something like this when his presence gets near I begin to hear something like way off in a distance something in this order 2 * 2 = 4 and if you'll listen to him on the tape he gets faster 2 * 2 = 4 closer 2 * 2al 4 he gets faster 2 * 2al 4 2 * 2 4 and he speaks each repeat a little faster on and on like this it's his presence coming learn a lot from this yield yourself and after a while you break away from yourself there Comes The Vision go to such and such place such such thing start off from meditating your mind on God out of the world away from the world out in the wilderness to yourself and it starts coming one one I say any number or anything just something starts gradually faintly coming in then it comes faster and faster you sit there and raise your hands don't say a word don't say a word just hold your hands up in the air first thing you know your whole being is caught away then you see things that he wants you to know shows you something that is to come sometimes it comes up to a spot to a certain spot and then it stops and that's true I've been studying for a message or or studying for something here and you come up to a spot and it's like like you ain't even saved it's like you ain't even got nothing right it's just like well you know what's happening is is God's God's stopping you from going in that direction cuz you don't need to go in that direction right now you need to turn listen to him and go over here I I never forget one time that we were at U we were in Oklahoma laying in the bed of sleep one Sunday morning I had my notes of course me you know me being a teacher I had everything laid out all the quotes all the notes and I was going to go preach this certain sermon well I just sit up in the bed about 6:00 at Brother cla's house and just like I was wi awake like I had even asleep and a voice say preach on Abraham start Genesis 12 and that's all I didn't feel this great warm anointing no I I mean I got up and started reading the Bible Jim was there too I mean she was asleep but I mean I didn't bother her but but do you understand what I'm saying and changed the whole thing and I didn't have a note one and I come out and just opened the Bible and we just talked about Adam's Journey Genesis 12 justification sanctification baptis and the Holy Ghost and a lady came up to me afterwards and said my son hadn't been in church in 3 or 4 months or whatever song it was and he was there that day and she said I had been praying that somebody would preach on that that one woman changed that whole sermon and if it wasn't but for the one boy that's okay makes me nervous a little bit sometimes but now I've learned and brother M will learn and each one of people that that get into the ministry you'll learn that that if God does that then you forget about you trying to do anything that's right if God tells you to preach on Genesis 12 about Abraham you just get up there and start talking and it'll just it'll just flow because you what you packed it in here and that's what brother Brand's done he's he had he had a knowledge of the scripture but watch this sometimes it comes to a spot to a certain spot and then stops I'm trying to tell you this today because this may help you in studying you know it may help you and and I hope to God that you take a little bit of time and and either study or think about God and think about the things that we're talking about that's right it doesn't go into a vision then scripture see it's easy to see a vision and see what's going to happen tomorrow that's easy but it said it doesn't go into a vision then scripture pours together he's taking it back to the Bible he's letting the prophet read it out of the Bible now why wouldn't he just pop up the scriptures in a vision no he wants brother Brown to learn to do what have knowledge that God was there Temperance patience godliness obviously brotherly kindness I grab my pencil so I won't forget it and write it down so I won't forget it oh it's from God you won't forget it yeah you're still human you'll forget it that's right like the um the old saying I always tell people the shortest pencil is greater than the longest memory does everybody understand what that means write it down right the shortest P the shortest pencil is greater than the longest memory so write it down and I come home and look it over study it and sometimes it don't even makes sense now this guy's got the Holy Ghost he's a prophet an end time Prophet with a gift sometimes it don't even make sense to me when I'm looking it over you see that and then after a while what patience after a while here it is that strikes and away it goes again and then I get a little book like this and just start sketching down just as hard as I can what he tells me I thought Lord I'm going down to the Tabernacle and tell them I said come on down I got something for them well that's how it come that's exactly until first he gives it to me I cannot give it out all right same way with our walk with God that's what I wanted to talk about today cuz I saw that and scroll through it and I thought well we got to learn how to approach God we got to learn how that when God does show up oh God's with you all the time now it's not when God shows up it's when we realize he's always been there all right it's so remember it's all on our side that's right it's like somebody we were talking about the other day you know God wasn't nervous when Luther was preaching just shall live by faith and was baptized and father son he wasn't nervous God wasn't nervous when in Genesis 3:15 when he said I'll put imy he knew all that before it ever started but he had to put us down here and give us a choice to make him a just God all right you get a lot out of Genesis remember brother said Genesis was a seed chapter so anything that had a seed or a beginning go back to Genesis it's in there somewhere and see that's the first speaking of redemption Genesis 3:15 so God was going to redeem us to start with he didn't just come up with that after the fall right no he made that provision before the foundation of the world cuz the Bible says go back to scripture says he stood as a lamb slain before God ever made the world so see we were protected before the foundation of the world all right you say well what we got to worry about well God's not worried that's right God's not worried at all there's no worry in him these virtues are for human beings God is the very Fountain of these virtues he's the Apex or the epitome or or or the he's the he's the ab absolute when it comes to these virtues okay he didn't need to gain them we do because we're in this we had to start somewhere because we're going somewhere all right and it's really beautiful that Redemption that was the first speaking of redemption and what did God say God said you'll bruise I'll bruise your head and you'll bruise my heel foot then you go back to Redemption again we talking about Redemption feet always represents Redemption I'm going to preach a sermon on that I got about 45 pages of notes so I'm going to have to condense them down just a little bit but all the way through the Bible feet represents Redemption well that's the first speaking of redemption what he said was is Satan I'm going to bruise your head you know what that's where you kill something from but if you hit somebody in the hill it's not going to kill them remember what did Jacob Jacob was a limping Prince all right because he was touched in the thigh all right so that showed that his walk was different that's what you and I we've got to see number one that we're either born again or not that's right cuz Redemption is you being born again Redemption is not just you coming to church and not just saying I'm a Christian Redemption is truly that you were like marriage and divorce if your old husband's still alive you can't be married to Christ cuz you're an adulterous you got two husbands you can't do that okay the spiritual part of marriage and divorce is wonderful Jun and I we're talking about today coming up the road the spiritual part of marriage and divorce is wonderful the natural part is not right but you got to see the natural part to see the spiritual part that's true all right that there is hope it's like I was telling brother Mark that marriage and divorce is a concrete steel titanium wall Jesus said from the beginning it wasn't so if you're married today and you've married a woman that's been married again you're living in adultery that's what the Bible says if you're a man today and you're married to a woman that's been married again you're an adultery that's what the Bible says you can't go past what that Bible says right you are committing adultery but then God takes a tablecloth called Grace and he lays it over he makes it softer but that's still under there don't ever get rid of that that's still solid he can't go past what his word says but he does have a blanket of Grace that goes over it that's right this says hey it's like the woman remember that's a very wonderful type of marriage and divorce Jesus was standing there Here Comes three Pharisees and they throw a woman down in front of him and said we caught her in the act of adultery what do you say now he knew what the law said law said kill her right but what did Jesus say in other words he said I didn't see her do it now if he would have seen her do it like Daddy said if he would have seen her he'd had to Stone her cuz he was a witness but when he got rid of her accusers that's what I've always said about Rahab Rahab was a she had had so many men in that City till she was living on the wall up top so she was you know just plain language she she knew her business and she had a lot of clients right right now how could she marryed an Israeli General and her being a and him being an Israeli General and through her come Jesse ohed oh forgot one Boaz David well the Bible plainly says everybody in that city was killed he accept her God did way with her accuser she had no one to accuse her that she was a prostitute cuz they were all dead and that's why you and I need to look at this thing the women in the Bible type me and you even though in the horest condition she was in even at the woman at the well even the one where God where where God was standing there and said woman I didn't see you do it and then he says hey if if you you got a if you don't have a problem you catch the first stone he knew they did he knew they did he discerned their their thoughts he knew they had had things so here we are Jesus said I didn't see you do it but remember here's the key he said your sins are forgiven but don't you ever do it again what June and I were talking about today about marriage and divorce brother R says go on As You Are now going on as you are is not if you were single you get married come on people yeah we don't understand that part that brother R said go on as you are if you're married and in a double marriage if you're that way stay that way he said but if you're single and then you get in a double marriage you're committing adultery sorry that's just the way the Bible is I'm sorry that's the you've lost this part cuz the grace of marriage and divorce is go on as you are and he said God forbid if you ever do it again right that's the grace of marriage and divorce not that you can go out and do what you want to no he said don't do it no more right here go on as you are what the people that were sitting there if they were married they had a Grace if they accepted it but if one if a woman was sitting there and had three living husbands and she was single at the time and then she goes out and gets married that ain't covered on a marriage and divorce she's an adultery she committed adultery all right so that's the same way with this this is getting rid of our old we got rid of our old husband when we were born again he's dead dead right dead not like brother R said put up in the closet now he's dead Peter knew his old husband was dead when he come up to the day of Pentecost and he said men and Brethren this is the Jesus that you crucified and he brought it a 30-minute sermon and those people knew that he was the spokesman he had changed he was different he knew he was changed he knew he was different that's what you and I got to look at with this teaching we got to know that we're different if we're not different we need to start working on it whatever happened to go to the altar we go to the altar now just because we're sick and somebody else has got a problem or like Susan you got a friend with a problem I got this friend watch yourself all of us well that's all we do that where we ever walked up to the Altar and said I just want to repent of what I've done I just want to repent I just that was what I wanted to do I knew I needed to get to church that Wednesday night cuz I needed to repent of what I've done but I wasn't filled with the Holy Ghost then that just chopped off my past sins that just made me feel good well the devil can do that see then I went on with God into sanctification which got rid of all that stuff right and then God filled me with the Holy Ghost cuz he started bringing the word and the word started fitting together not that I put it together he brought brought it right and it started fitting together and and then I began to see that my life had really changed then so that's what we got to see we got to see that our life has changed and then we can start growing up the statue of a perfect man all right so that's why I want you to see again even with brother brandom here he is he's a prophet but he still has to write things down he still has to remember things he still has to ask God to do things for him he's not some automatic even I'm like Daddy Jesus when he got up in the morning I don't think he said no I got to act like God today no it was Jesus that's right it was Jesus but when something would come he said the prince of this world come has nothing to me well when he would come where you and I were born in sin shapen in iniquity and have this old nature that we got to get rid of you say well that Nature's got to die sure but there's still that Spirit part of you that's right memory reason conscious F and Imagination that's where these things that's right take care of that everybody understand that your soul right now if you're born again listen already has that that's right already has love cuz that's what that's what that love is that love is not just me loving my wife now that's Christ loving us so much that he died for us and we accepted it and he gave us his life everybody got there the Holy Ghost you got inside you has that love has that brotherly kindness what checks you now if you're born again what checks you when you're almost doing something wrong or have a bad thought or getting ready to do something what checks you now that it used to not so used to I would say bad words and I just say it cuz that was me that was my nature but when I got a nature change I told you many times before I was talking to a guy you know probably a year after I I'd come back to the Lord and and the word come in my almost come out of my mouth but when I almost said that it felt like somebody hit me right here in the chest and all the air went out of my mouth and the guy I was on the phone with it Ken I was talking to Ken my old hunting buddy and he said what happened CU he heard me go cuz I was getting ready to say he ain't worth them you know and it never came out he said what happened I said well I started to say a word and I shouldn't and of course he never made any mention to that but after that we just kept on talking but that was where God protected me he was keeping me from doing that I wasn't I had it in my brain and it was getting ready to come out of my mouth you say oh no no we brother brandom even says I have to watch what I say see it may not have been a bad word but what if he said something a little different see he's a he was a prophet God had to remember even he did one time he took a scripture right and the seals in the questions and answerers on the seals he took a scripture and answered it wrong what' he do that knowledge in the pyramid remember he stopped and he said is there something wrong something's going on something's happening what happens somebody get sick what he felt something something strange I've done that a few times in my life you feel something strange going to happen or fixing to happen or and you know what I do I just start praying you know I just say God you know whatever it is stop it you know or whoever it is just just start praying for him but that knowledge that he had knew there was something wrong so you know what he didn't just continue on and say bless God I know I'm right no and this was at the opening of the seals he says no stop and somebody said read your scripture over again cuz that brother saw that the scripture was the way it was supposed to be well see that was God showing us and the prophet he said look at there he said something about he's here or he W he wouldn't let me answer that wrong or continue on well that's the way with you and I sure there's things we do wrong we're human and and thoughts are the worst yes you can't help the the old thoughts that you had before but the problem with before was we dwelled on them we manifested our thoughts that's right right now if you manifest your thoughts now and they're the same ones you have you're not born again you need the Lord cuz but if you're still cussing and all kind of stuff like that you ain't got the Holy Ghost I'm sorry that goes out at sanctification not at the new birth got it yes all right so you know if you are just say born again if you don't want to come to church every Sunday if you want don't want to desire to be around Christians you need to do something you you need to go to the Altar and repent start over again God don't care you understand he don't you know why I'm saying you don't care he don't care if you go to the Altar and say God I know I'm not born again save me he he don't mind that I don't want to use that word care God cares about everything but but I mean it's not going to make him nervous not going to make him upset he's just showing you where you are and thank God a father will show you where you're at amen that's what that's why brother R said you can see where you're at at any time why because God is telling you that's right he knows where you're at you don't but when he said when you come to a keep point in your life cuz remember this is just life lesson when you come to a key point in your life and something drops in and it's different than what it was before and it's better makes you a better not a better person but makes you a better Christian makes you think different act different then you know one thing for sure God's leading you cuz the devil's not going to do that that's right exactly now when you come into the into the into the the the faith of God and the new birth that's that's God that's not the devil that's God the devil don't have nothing to do with he don't want you to do that now he wants you to feel kind of religious though yes and do religious things that's true but God wants you to walk you to Virtue walk you to knowledge and somewhere you know what he'll do that that's true he'll bring something in your life to where where somebody will come to you and say hey what do I need to do about a situation you say well that's just life lessons that's virtue they came to you for some reason they came to you for some reason it wasn't just because you were somebody I'm not going to go to a drunk and find out how to be a Christian right okay yes and even a even a spirit baby in Christ can help you but that person is got to grow with you he's got to grow up that's why we have a uh you know Elders in the church that don't even have to be preachers they're just Elders they're they're people that stand in a position that you know that person's been through it and he can help you or she can help you if you'll just listen to them you just listen they'll help you all right that's why that I we're on the internet I don't care anything about young pastors sorry these little young guys that start out 22 and 25 and 30 year old pastoring churches sorry I just ain't got a lot I just ain't got a lot for that I want somebody that's seasoned and solid and been through something and and you know I want somebody that's Rock Solid you know cuz it's my soul on the line not whether I like the guy or whether he's oh he's young he can do things athletes are young and they can do things what do the matter you know I mean what are you comparing I want to hear the word of God and have some wisdom behind it see I was telling somebody the other day and and this is my fault that I have I was talking to Donnie the other day and and and we were talking about something and I said now if I would be preaching marriage and divorce right now most of you would be mad at me the way I bring it but Daddy brings it in such a way to where he's bringing it the same way I would but it's got a whole lot of Sav on it it's got a lot of nurturing but see that's his growth development that's his position in God that God is able to give it to me and you right not soft soap it now he don't soft soap it but he brings it in a way that it don't make you mad see that's where I got to grow because I would bring it and if I preach marriage and divorce we'd all going to help all of us but there's that blanket of Grace and there's somebody that can stand and do that and I appreciate being with a pastor that even with my dad or not being my dad he's a pastor enough to where that he can bring things that sometimes the internet people seems they they think oh hard well he is hard but he brings it in a way to where you just love him for doing it that's right well see that's God that's not the devil the devil would want you to get mad the devil would want you to stay at home and not listen and fuss and argue now that's what he wants but see God will bringing in a way to where we all go hey like brother Mark said he said man everybody was kind of somber Sunday said nobody was saying amen or hard I said you know what I said because they hit home that's right to every one of us cuz he's talking about this guy right now but once we see this guy can be redeemed and is redeemable which it is there's that blanket it is it is hard but once God throws that Grace on it it makes it a lot easier let's go upstairs see you next Sunday think on these things [Music]
