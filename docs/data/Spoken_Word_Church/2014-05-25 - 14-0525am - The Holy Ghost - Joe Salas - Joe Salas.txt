========================================

oh I found out one thing for sure you want to have patience get a buddy pass from Benny morning it's the's time and brother Jo's time that's righted in my face big time you ever have to spend the night in in a u it's all airport yeah it's all uh last time I was talking about uh the token which for Israel was the token was a to kill the lamb and put the blood on a land and door post but uh that that was just a type of the Holy Ghost uh but today that won't work for us we've got to have that fullness of uh of the Holy Ghost Jesus God himself had to to come and die you got to talk over the fame God himself had to die on the cross for us uh so uh brother brother B preached uh very many messages on Holy Ghost uh what is the Holy Ghost what was the Holy Ghost given for question and answer on the Holy Ghost and uh did you guys know the whole Bible of the Holy Ghost yeah that's right yeah but we have to prove about the scriptures so uh second Peter 1:21 says for the prophecy came not in the old time by the will of men but holy men of God expect as they were moved by the Holy Ghost right okay let's go to acts uh 7 start at 1 1 through uh 8 then said the high priest are these things so and he said men and Brethren and Father's hearken the god of Glory appeared unto our Father Abraham when he was in Macedonia before he dwelt in Cher and said unto him get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and come into the land shall show thee then he came out of the land of the children and dwell in ch and from then when his father was did he removed him into this land where he now dwelt and he gave him none inheritance and it not so much as to set his foood on it on it yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession into his seed Not seeds seed which is one that's right after him and when as yet he had no child and God spake on this wiv that his seed should were sojourn in a Strange Land and that that they shall bring them into bondage and and treat them evil for 100 400 years and the nation to whom they shall be in abundance will I judge said God after that there shall they come forth and serve me in this place and he gave him the Covenant of circumcision and so Abraham beg got Isaac and circumcised him the a day and Isaac begot Jacob and Jacob begot the 12 patriarch in the message the what is the Holy Ghost brother said and that's the way we receiving the Holy Ghost he said you got to know what what you're coming for and how to receive it and what it is he said uh now the first place the Holy Holy Spirit has been promised mhm he said now I want to talk on it as the holy spirit being a sign where is the sign we realize that all promises is given to us by Abraham was the father of the promise because God gave the promise to Abraham and to receed after him the promise was made to Abraham and to his seat and this is sign is to a covenant people amen uh let's go to acts uh 7 but we're going to go to 51 verse 51 he said uh you stiff necks uncircumcised and heart and ears you do always resist the Holy Ghost as your father did so do you what what did David say for who is this uncircumcised belting that he should defile the armies of a living God so there there is a difference between the the Holy Ghost fill people and the ones that on that's right he said any child that refuses circumcision in the Old Testament which was the foreshadow of the Holy Ghost was cut off from among the people he could not have fellowship with the rest of the congregation if he refused to be circumcised is said now that P that today a person that will refuse to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost can have no Fellowship among those that have the Holy Ghost who just can't do it you have to be in nature you have to be what says nature and that's the way it is with a world and with a Christian when you have been circumcised by the Holy Ghost which is means to be cut off the flesh says circumcision synchron be made in a male but if a woman was married to a man she was part of him she was circumcised with him you remember intimity where said in there not withstanding she shall be saved and shall be if she continues in the faith and Holiness with alls about that all the time he said now you say brother BR that a sign of circumcision was given to Abraham he said that is true and to the seed he said how do we take on Abraham's seed by being in Christ then we are Abraham's seed he said now it's also besides the promise and a sign is also a seal now if you go with me into let's go to Ephesians 430 it says and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption he said that's what the holy spirit is it's the Seal of God and that he's found found you found Grace in his sight and he loves you and he believes you and he's put his seal upon you what is a seal anyone for a seal destinat or means that finish work amen God has saved you sanctify you clean you up found favor with you and seal you he's finished your this product until the day of your Redemption the seal is a finished thing and he talks about the railroad uh car that uh they had to load them up and pack them up think shakes that the the inspector doesn't put a seal on it he said uh that's what the matter we don't get sealed so much we're too loose about things said when the inspector goes through to inspect your life to see if you're not just a little loose about these things little loose about your prayer life little loose about that temper little loose about that tongue to talk about others you'll never see the car some dirty habits some V thing some vulgarity M you can't seal the car he said but when he found everything in his place the inspector then he sealed it he said there be anybody open that seal until that car has reached his destination to where sheld for there is there is touch not my anointing do profets no harm for I say unto you it be better for you that a mstone went L at your neck and you were drown in the dep of the sea and even to try to offend or shake a little on un least that is that's been sealed you see what it means so that's what the holy spirit is it's your Assurance it's your protection it's your witness it's your seal it's your sign that your heaven bound don't care what the devil says I'm having bound while he seal me he gave it to me he sealed me into his kingdom and I'm Glory bound we go to Beach Island to pick up uh it's Kimberly CLK uh pick up toilet paper paper towel diapers hand and uh we go in they tell you drop your Trail to a certain place and then go to the shipping office pick up your paperwork and you pick up a loaded trailer which is already sealed now when you go out of the gate they check your seal when you get to Madonna that seal better not be broken because right yep they'll refuse the whole thing sure will so that's right it has to be seal till he reach his destination in the message the Seal of antichrist but said uh what is the Seal of Satan was to reject the gospel and the Jubilee they were given a good news and they rejected it they are seal outside the kingdom to serve their Master the rest of their they were sealed by the ear for Faith cometh by hearing not physical he but spiritual hear who rejected for their last time and you're sealed out the at Christ 1955 said uh Jesus came to the Earth to bring a jubilee to the human race that through the preaching of the Gospel hearing by faith might set every slave to sin free right let's go to Hebrews 10 26 to 27 Hebrews 10:26 27 for we sin willfully after that we have received the the knowledge of the truth there remain no more sacrifi for sin but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and FY indignation which shall Devol adversary I was going to say this but uh want to read the book of Acts it's uh questions and answers in 19 56 said did 1959 he said did anybody here ever see the C the M's 10 commandments did you notice when the Commandments was been written how he caught it I didn't know there was two or three things that I've seen in that that I really like the first thing is that ameral light that's exactly what it looked like see another thing was when the Commandments was written after it was over did you notice flying away from that that big pill of fire there was little licks of fire flying away did you notice that did you notice that what I what what I think this was a Pentecost there appeared unto them so they could see it it didn't say there fell on them but there appear D licks we call it tongues like tongue like this tongue shape of the tongue lick apart now ear as I said ear ear is ear finger is finger finger don't mean you felt it it means it look like a finger if it was a if it was their ear didn't mean they heard it it looked like an ear this was far that look like a tongue mhm not someone speaking a fire that look like a tongue like that let's go to Galatians uh chapter 3 so got to mix it up a little bit remember what I said the old B of the Holy Ghost that's right Galatians 3 verse 16 now to Abraham and to his Seed where that promise made he said not to seed as of many but as of one and to they seed which is Christ let's go to 2829 say there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither B are free there is neither male nor female for you all all one in Christ Jesus and in Jesus be Christ then are you Abraham seat and hairs according to the promise let's go to St John 14 T you CL believe believe it that now that I am in the father and the father in me the work that I do I speak on unto you I speak not of myself but the father dwell in me do it the work believe me that I am in the father and the father me or else believe me for the very work say barely barely I say unto you he that believe on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go onto you my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that I will do that the father may be glorified son and the son if he shall ask anything in my name I will do it if you leave me if you love me keep my Commandments yeah and I will pray the father that he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever so what is the Holy Ghost is a comforter too amen let's go to St John 16 7 to 11 nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedent for you that I go away for if I go not away the Comfort will not come unto you but if I the cour I will send him unto you and when he has come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of Judgment of sin because they believe not on me I rightous because I go to my father and you see me no more of judgment because the prince of this world is Jud yeah that's right so what is the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the whole Bible the Holy Ghost is Christ in you it's a sign it's a seal it's a covenant it's a comforter he's a Advocate the Spirit Alive the god of Heaven he's power from on high let's go to Luke 24 verse 49 Luke 2449 and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tear you in the city of Jerusalem till you be with power from on high he's our guide Luke 17 verse 211 says the Kingdom of Heaven is within you that's right am the said demons don't die but the Holy Ghost doesn't either he's also a teacher and what what was the purpose of uh uh on the message what was what was the Holy Ghost given for brother said the purpose of sending the Holy Ghost was for God to continue through a bunch of people to continually manifest God to the world that's a second not by a Creed not by a denomination but by the power of His restoration by making his word Real by taking his promise and standing on the side of the minority and believe in God and watch the black Skies move back and the power of God move in and take over amen that's what he one that's what the Holy Ghost was sent for that's what the purpose he sent it for we know what it is now and that's why he sent it what is the whole ghost BR the body of Christ is one Spirit where every member from Pentecost to this time drinks the same new wine the same Holy Ghost bringing forth the same result I do we do it by one spirit it's God's Open Door the Holy Spirit what is it it's God's open door it's a sign it's a seal it's a comforter it's an advocate it's an assurance it's rest it's peace it's goodness it's healing it's life it's God's open door to all these things it's God's open door to Christ people which has okay I going to you guys like I say you take do good job
