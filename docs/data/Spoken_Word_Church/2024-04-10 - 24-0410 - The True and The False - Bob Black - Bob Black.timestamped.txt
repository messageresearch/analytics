[17:43] brother Shambo and and the Saints up

[17:51] little scripture from second
[17:52] Thessalonians chapter 2 um verses 1 and
[17:55] 8 1 to8 and then we'll read Matthew
[17:59] chapter 24 let's just go to the Lord in

[18:04] able to gather around your word tonight
[18:06] Lord Jesus and Lord we just ask Lord

[18:10] up here in the middle of the Week

[18:41] your name amen
[18:44] amen now uh as I so as I'm as I read the
[18:48] scripture just kind of meditate on the
[18:50] on the uh thought maybe tonight that
[18:52] there's a true and there's a false and
[18:54] and of course we want to be a real
[18:56] genuine True Believer and of course
[18:58] there's a there's also you it's
[19:01] unavoidable to know that there's a
[19:02] there's a false as well and if we can
[19:05] look in the scripture and just kind of
[19:06] see what we're identified as and and if
[19:08] we're identified with the wrong thing
[19:10] then make adjustments and uh and and
[19:13] repent and get on the right track am but
[19:16] in 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 if we read
[19:18] it it says now we beseech you Brethren
[19:21] by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[19:23] and by our gathering together unto him
[19:26] that ye be not soon shaken in mind or
[19:28] betr trouble neither by Spirit nor by
[19:30] word nor by letter as from us as that
[19:33] the day of Christ is at hand let no man
[19:36] deceive you by any means for that day
[19:38] shall not come except there come a
[19:40] falling away first and that man of sin
[19:43] be revealed the son of predition who
[19:45] opposeth and exalteth himself above all
[19:48] that is called God or is worshiped so
[19:50] that he is God sth in the temple of God
[19:53] showing himself that he is
[19:56] God remember you not that when I was yet
[19:59] with you I told you these things and now
[20:02] you know what withholdeth that he might
[20:04] be revealed in his time for the mystery
[20:06] of iniquity do already work only he who
[20:08] now lth will let until be until he be
[20:11] taken out of the way and then shall that
[20:13] Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall
[20:15] consume with the mouth with the spirit
[20:17] of his mouth and shall destroy with the
[20:19] brightness of his coming you may be
[20:22] seated Lord at his Blessing to the
[20:24] reading of the
[20:27] word so brother is talking about or or
[20:29] Paul here is talking about the uh the
[20:32] mystery of iniquity that already work
[20:34] only he who now lth will let you think
[20:37] about that what a strange say way that
[20:40] Paul had with his words he that and
[20:42] brother R will say he God that L us will
[20:44] let until he the church Christ the bride
[20:46] be taken out of the way and you know we
[20:48] you meditate on that we know that one
[20:50] day Christ is going to step out of the
[20:52] way one one day he's going to take us
[20:55] out of the way he's going to just just
[20:57] remove remove move the holy ghost from
[20:59] the earth and then the wicked one shall
[21:02] be revealed but but even back then even
[21:04] back then the deceiver when Paul was
[21:06] preaching the deceiver was already
[21:08] working so in other words there's
[21:09] something fake and you think back there
[21:11] all the way back in that Ephesian Church
[21:13] age Paul was preaching a real genuine
[21:16] gospel that birthed real genuine
[21:19] Believers that produced something real
[21:21] genuine and then alongside of them there
[21:23] was something fake all the way back then
[21:26] that Faker that Faker the devil work and
[21:29] that he could get himself inside of
[21:30] inside of men's hearts and get them
[21:32] deceived and get them to preach
[21:34] something that wasn't right even though
[21:36] they might be anointed by the real
[21:37] genuine Holy Ghost and have a real
[21:39] calling in their life that want to see
[21:41] Souls saved and want to go to church and
[21:43] want to do things that are right and
[21:45] want to sit in the Pew and all those
[21:46] kind of things but but yet down in their
[21:48] heart there's something wrong oh you
[21:50] think about think about what makes
[21:52] somebody right and what's somebody
[21:53] somebody wrong what makes somebody real
[21:55] and true and genuine real True Believer
[21:58] and what makes them fake what makes them
[22:00] fake where that devil that deceiver is
[22:02] down on the inside now in Matthew 24 if
[22:05] we'll read that Matthew 24 24-28 it says
[22:08] for there shall arise false Christ and
[22:11] false prophets and shall show great
[22:14] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[22:17] were
[22:18] possible I'm so glad that's put in there
[22:21] if if it were possible but of course
[22:24] that means it's close it's very
[22:28] deceptive Ive they shall deceive the
[22:31] very elect behold I've told you before
[22:34] wherefore if they shall say unto you
[22:37] behold he is in the desert go not forth
[22:41] behold he is in the secret Chambers
[22:42] believe it
[22:44] not now you think about what that really
[22:46] is saying there oh you you got to have a
[22:49] revelation of where you can find God
[22:51] somebody will say well if you go over to
[22:53] this church or you follow this movement
[22:55] or you follow these men or follow this
[22:57] man over there like like that then
[23:00] follow try to find a particular movement
[23:02] that you can get behind and grab onto
[23:03] somebody's coattails and follow them in
[23:05] like that but it don't work you got to
[23:07] have a real personal revelation of for
[23:10] yourself oh you see that's actually what
[23:12] what what's taking place when you come
[23:13] to church is is we're not trying to get
[23:15] you to a particular man behind the
[23:17] platform or particular movement like
[23:19] that but we're trying to get you to an
[23:21] in to introduce you to Jesus Christ we
[23:25] got the paintings up here on the wall if
[23:27] you can get in touch with Jesus Christ
[23:29] get in touch with the male if the male
[23:32] can fertilize the the egg if if if the
[23:34] union can take place then something will
[23:36] begin to happen and you'll have your own
[23:38] relationship with God and that's what
[23:39] will carry you through so if they say
[23:42] unto you behold he's in the desert go
[23:44] not forth behold he in the secret
[23:46] Chambers believe it not for as the
[23:49] lightning cometh out of the East and
[23:50] shineth even under the West so shall
[23:53] also the coming of the son of man be for
[23:56] wheresoever the carcass is there where
[23:58] will the Eagles be gathered together
[24:01] wherever the carcass is now we were we
[24:03] were up there at uh that when we were
[24:06] visiting Zach and Lily we were sitting
[24:07] out there looking over the field and
[24:10] there was a big old eagle flying and and
[24:12] we were of course you know the eagle
[24:14] he's he's flying around that what a
[24:16] beautiful sight flying over the field
[24:18] looking looking for food and we used to
[24:21] have this little joke when Zach was
[24:22] little he he he uh he might do his
[24:25] finger like a rhinoceros and he say he's
[24:26] looking for food well well that that's
[24:29] what that eagle is doing is looking for
[24:30] food and that's what any Eagle is going
[24:32] to be doing is looking for food and
[24:34] that's where you're going to find the
[24:35] eagle where the carcass is where the
[24:37] where the where the fresh kill and the
[24:40] season and the hour that we're living in
[24:42] that's where you're going to find the
[24:44] eagle amen cuz Eagles Eagles real
[24:47] spiritual Eagles are going to be where
[24:48] the word is I like how brother Chris
[24:51] Long explained Eagles there's all kind
[24:53] kind of different Eagles there's there's
[24:55] bald eagles and this kind of eagle and
[24:57] that kind of Eagle what kind of eagle we
[24:58] talking about we're talking about a
[24:59] bride Eagle we're talking about a
[25:02] supernatural Eagle I like that where
[25:04] eagle and this kind of Eagle is going to
[25:05] be where the word is so we're following
[25:08] the word we're following the word we're
[25:10] following the truth to a real genuine
[25:14] true Christian Life something that ain't
[25:17] fake something that's real and what's
[25:20] going to differentiate it what's going
[25:21] to what's going to be the way that you
[25:22] can tell is is the word the word is the
[25:25] thing that tell what kind of message are
[25:27] you bringing are you bringing a real
[25:29] message like those those those women
[25:31] that come from the from the Tomb of
[25:33] Jesus and they came they had a message
[25:35] but he's alive he's risen what about P
[25:37] Peter on the day of Pentecost when he
[25:38] come down and he had a re he knew what
[25:40] he was talking about and he was he had a
[25:42] real Revelation he uh the the word that
[25:45] he had been H that he had been taught
[25:47] for all those years that he had been
[25:49] with Jesus was quickened and he knew
[25:51] what he was talking about when he came
[25:53] down from that upper
[25:55] room now brother Brown when he was
[25:57] preaching the first seal
[25:58] he said we were talking the other day
[26:00] about people who getting off the track
[26:02] it's just like shooting a Target if that
[26:04] gun is perfectly balanced perfectly
[26:07] trained inside it it's got to hit the
[26:09] target unless that Barrel moves or
[26:11] twists or vibrations throws it off or
[26:14] wherever or a wind puff wherever it
[26:17] starts off at there's only one way to do
[26:20] it's come back to where it left the
[26:22] track and start again if it's going to
[26:24] hit the target if it doesn't why it just
[26:27] doesn't hit the target
[26:28] so what's what's happening as we follow
[26:30] the word the word is leading us leading
[26:32] us from here to here to here to until we
[26:35] just hit right on the Target now if we
[26:38] get off the word then we're going to
[26:39] miss the target if you get off the word
[26:42] into some seven Thunders doctrine of Two
[26:43] Souls Doctrine or some kind of strange
[26:46] way to believe this or that or strange
[26:48] way to believe the baptism of the Holy
[26:49] Ghost or you get off to where you know
[26:52] people people have read this sermon that
[26:53] I'm I'm mixing two sermons tonight if
[26:55] you hadn't figured that out the anointed
[26:57] ones of the end time and the the first
[26:58] seal so let's squish those two sermons
[27:01] together and you got what I'm preaching
[27:02] at but people read the anointed ones at
[27:04] the end time until they come away with
[27:07] the well we don't need any kind of move
[27:08] of the spirit and so you start going off
[27:11] that track and you're wrong you're wrong
[27:14] you you start going off the track well
[27:16] you can be fake because you've got you
[27:19] can be fake with a genuine baptism of
[27:22] the Holy Ghost and your spirit but no
[27:25] message and so that doesn't mean let's
[27:28] just put away the any kind of move of
[27:29] the spirit though and on the other hand
[27:31] that doesn't mean let's get away get so
[27:33] fundamental and you know you can balance
[27:35] in everything and so that's what brother
[27:38] Ram said he said and and that's the way
[27:39] in studying the scripture I
[27:41] believe you'll never figure it with your
[27:44] mind it takes the lamb to reveal it the
[27:47] lamb alone can do
[27:50] it oh what a what a strange thing that
[27:53] when you read the Bible you don't read
[27:54] it like Shake you're reading a
[27:55] Shakespeare novel or or you're reading
[27:57] it like some kind of uh something you
[28:00] find in the supermarket line or
[28:01] something that you don't read it like a
[28:02] newspaper like that but the only way you
[28:05] can really understand it is to be in
[28:08] touch with the author that's right you
[28:10] got to you got to know the author if you
[28:12] really know the author then the book
[28:14] begins to come alive it begins to change
[28:16] it's different you I I I certainly know
[28:20] I remember when I used I started reading
[28:21] the Bible we were talking about this
[28:23] this weekend you start reading the Bible
[28:25] when you first become a Christian and
[28:27] it's that King James language and you're
[28:29] like I don't know what in the world this
[28:31] is saying what does this mean and you
[28:33] just keep forging ahead you keep reading
[28:36] you ask questions you look in you look
[28:38] in the message and search for that
[28:40] answer about what this scripture means
[28:41] and you just keep reading and after a
[28:43] while you start understanding the
[28:45] language and after a while you start
[28:47] understanding it better and then after a
[28:49] while then you can really read between
[28:51] the lines oh and then after a while it
[28:54] starts popping off the page you see
[28:56] that's actually what people people know
[28:58] maybe you're sitting here tonight you're
[28:59] like I wish I wish they would preach on
[29:01] the Seven Seals and that I could get
[29:03] that little that little nugget that's
[29:05] really going to take me into the Rapture
[29:07] but then when the seals begin to open up
[29:09] to you you realize that the seals have
[29:11] been being preached all along and you
[29:14] just didn't realize it you didn't
[29:16] realize it until the seals really open
[29:19] up to you and you begin to see the veil
[29:21] begin to pull off over your life and
[29:24] what's happened to the church over the
[29:25] last thousand 2,000 years what's
[29:27] happened to you as an individual and
[29:29] then it becomes real to you so see
[29:31] there's something happening as we're
[29:33] coming to church there's something
[29:34] really H super natural happening if you
[29:37] really fall in love with God and it's
[29:40] and it's exciting to you it's exciting
[29:43] to you it's it and brother R will say
[29:45] you'll never figure it with your mind
[29:47] you'll never figure it with your mind it
[29:50] takes the lamb to reveal it the lamb
[29:53] alone can do it amen now thank God that
[29:56] we've got a lamb amen thank God that
[29:59] we've got a lamb that that there's a
[30:01] lamb that's sitting on the throne that
[30:03] come off the throne to reveal these
[30:05] things to us to to signify that he's
[30:07] already paid the price that he's the one
[30:09] that's worthy and he's made us worthy by
[30:12] his righteousness to look in the book
[30:15] and read it we got a lamb to reveal
[30:17] these things so that means that God is
[30:19] going to have a a target hdden church a
[30:22] church that if they'll just stay with
[30:23] the word they're going to hit the target
[30:26] that there's going to he's going to have
[30:28] a church that is balanced that's right
[30:30] down the line that doesn't go off to
[30:32] this side or that side in everything
[30:36] right down the line he's going to have
[30:38] somebody that's balanced and he's going
[30:40] to have a church that is unmovable and a
[30:42] church that is true now that's what
[30:45] we're talking about tonight true versus
[30:49] false now it isn't that what the first
[30:51] seal is
[30:52] about you got a lion and you got that
[30:56] white horse rider there's something true
[30:59] and something
[31:01] fake now I I think that should stir
[31:04] everybody up that to begin to look into
[31:06] things like that that ought to wake us
[31:08] up here on a Wednesday night service
[31:10] when we're right here in the middle of
[31:11] the week and we've only been preaching
[31:13] just a few minutes what's the Target
[31:16] that we're shooting for the Target is
[31:18] Christ the target is Christ for Christ
[31:21] to be completely revealed and his bride
[31:23] to be completely revealed and you as I
[31:26] and I as individuals for Christ to just
[31:28] take over to just take everything over
[31:30] and and the target is Christ so that
[31:32] means that the target is those seven
[31:34] Thunders under the seventh seal Thunder
[31:36] Thunder against the devil Thunder where
[31:39] it's actually lived out and it's
[31:41] manifested and that that'll be thunder
[31:43] that'll be a Thunder against the devil
[31:45] where not just something that you know
[31:47] so you could tell somebody how much you
[31:48] know but actually lived out in your life
[31:52] so that it's Thunder that the devil can
[31:54] come and maybe maybe give a give you a
[31:56] good little mind battle
[31:58] but you recognize it's the devil give
[32:01] you a good little test but you can stand
[32:04] the test because there something real in
[32:06] your life something that's not make
[32:09] believe and the seventh seal brother R
[32:11] said now do you notice on the opening of
[32:13] this seventh seal also it's in a
[32:14] three-fold mystery this one I have will
[32:17] speak and I've spoke that it is the
[32:18] mystery of the seven Thunders the seven
[32:21] thunders in heaven will unfold this
[32:22] mystery it'll be right at the coming of
[32:25] Christ because Christ said no one knew
[32:27] when he would return amen right there
[32:30] under the seventh seal the seven
[32:32] Thunders which is the mysteries of each
[32:35] seal the Mysteries so now what we're
[32:38] talking about tonight is you canare it
[32:40] what you heard somebody say about the
[32:41] seals you can understand all the
[32:43] terminology you can know the symbols you
[32:44] can know the seals technically you can
[32:46] know all the details of one God and you
[32:48] can have brother randam statements
[32:49] memorized but now the Thunder is the
[32:52] voice of God to you God revealing
[32:55] himself to you amen God revealing
[32:57] himself and putting himself on display
[32:59] in you cuz you know when a revelation
[33:01] when God gives you a revelation the side
[33:03] effect of the
[33:05] Revelation is is works because faith is
[33:09] a revelation and when you got faith it's
[33:12] going to work itself out it's going to
[33:14] act itself out if you got a real
[33:16] Revelation it's going to change your
[33:18] behavior it's going to change the way
[33:20] you look at things and change the way
[33:21] you act it will change everything if you
[33:24] got a real Revelation like we had uh
[33:26] last Sunday you just had a baptism if
[33:28] you got a real Revelation you need to go
[33:30] down to the water and be baptized you're
[33:32] going to do it amen if you got a real
[33:35] revelation of of how to treat others and
[33:37] it begins to change the way all of a
[33:39] sudden if you got a real Revelation you
[33:41] can treat somebody
[33:43] nice that that you know don't like you
[33:46] and it begins to change now that there's
[33:49] there's a real Thunder the Thunder the
[33:52] revelation of what's under these seals
[33:54] in Revelation chapter 6 it says when I I
[33:56] saw when the L opened one of the seals I
[33:58] heard as it were the noise of Thunder
[34:01] one of the four beasts saying come and
[34:02] see and brother an would say no doubt
[34:04] John might have jumped up in the air
[34:06] when a thunder roared in Revelation
[34:09] chapter 10 and it says is he had in his
[34:11] hand a little book open and he set his
[34:13] right foot upon the sea and his left
[34:14] foot on the earth and cried with a loud
[34:17] voice as when a lion Roth and when he
[34:19] had cried seven Thunders utter their
[34:22] voices it's got to be lived it's got to
[34:25] be something genuine something real
[34:28] something real a genuine Christian Life
[34:31] a genuine Sanctified
[34:35] life I'm now I'm debating whether to
[34:37] keep to to kind of skip over some of
[34:39] these or not I've got so much Snokes
[34:41] tonight and I know it's Wednesday night
[34:43] and I'm trying not to get y'all upset
[34:45] with
[34:47] me he preached the seals on Wednesday
[34:52] night something real so the Thunder
[34:55] what's the Thunder is going to reveal
[34:56] it's going to reveal John chap pretend I
[34:58] am my father are one and that's when the
[35:00] Jews took up stones to Stone him I am my
[35:02] father what why cuz the seal the Thunder
[35:04] is Christ it's Christ revealed it's
[35:07] Christ what what taken over it's a
[35:09] takeover by Christ that Christ
[35:11] completely can completely take you over
[35:13] until your confession will be I and my
[35:15] father are one I I oh to think that you
[35:19] could say we can come to a place where
[35:21] you can say I don't do nothing except
[35:23] the father shows me I only do that which
[35:26] you know the father show me in John chap
[35:29] 14:30 Hereafter I will not talk much
[35:31] with you for the prince of this world
[35:32] cometh and hath nothing in me and God
[35:35] wants us to have that same confession
[35:36] that I don't have nothing in the devil I
[35:38] don't have anything to do with the Devil
[35:41] the devil will try to give me some kind
[35:42] of mind battle and make me upset with
[35:44] somebody make me uh you know and just
[35:47] just you can say
[35:49] no that's so what's the seals reveal it
[35:53] reveals something genuine something true
[35:56] now the first seal certainly it's going
[35:57] to reveal something genuine and
[35:59] something real and something false and
[36:02] deceptive so there you see that seal
[36:04] being open there's something genuine
[36:06] something something true something real
[36:09] oh thank God for a real gospel tonight
[36:11] thank God for a real baptism of the Holy
[36:13] Ghost and a real message that we've got
[36:15] we've heard and it's going to reveal
[36:18] something false and something
[36:21] deceptive and in Revelation chapter 6 it
[36:23] says and I saw when the lamb opened one
[36:25] of the seals and I heard as it were the
[36:27] noise of Thunder one of the four Beast
[36:29] saying come and see and I saw and behold
[36:31] a white horse and and he that sat on him
[36:34] had a bow and a crown was given unto him
[36:37] and he went forth conquering un
[36:38] conquering now now of course we know we
[36:41] know that progression every there's a
[36:43] progression in in in everything
[36:44] justification sanctification the baptism
[36:46] of the Holy Ghost there's a progression
[36:48] from angels to sarap from all the way up
[36:50] to cheram and you think what cherub what
[36:52] a cheram represents it represents that
[36:55] genuine power the genuine power power of
[36:57] the Holy Ghost a genuine a holy life
[37:00] somebody that's really filled with the
[37:02] baptism of Holy Ghost something that's
[37:04] real something that's true and brother
[37:07] Brown said in the seed shall not be air
[37:09] with a shook he said now remember
[37:11] according to Revelation the whole
[37:13] mystery of the book is sealed with Seven
[37:15] Seals that the reformers didn't have a
[37:18] chance to bring forth the four stages of
[37:21] reforming the four stages of four beasts
[37:24] that went out to meet the four powers of
[37:26] the world y the first went out was what
[37:30] a what a strange thing those four
[37:33] creatures that everywhere they go
[37:35] they're always they're never going back
[37:36] they're always going forward now isn't
[37:39] that the same way with a Christian Life
[37:40] we don't go backwards we're going
[37:42] forwards everything we do is forward no
[37:45] matter what's the whether it's the lion
[37:46] or if you're in that stage of the ox or
[37:48] the man or the eagle no matter what your
[37:50] stage is you're always going forward and
[37:52] it's the holy ghost power there's power
[37:54] in your life now in the in the in the
[37:57] Wilderness when Ezekiel Saw it there was
[37:59] the wheel in the middle of the wheel cuz
[38:00] they were on their Journey but it's it's
[38:03] that power the power of God and every
[38:05] case and he said what was the first went
[38:07] out a lion to meet the Roman age that
[38:10] was the word the original he is the lion
[38:13] of the tribe of Judah Christ himself
[38:16] went to meet that age and sat oh you
[38:20] think you got a a real genuine
[38:22] Revelation from God that God give you
[38:26] something genuine and true that's
[38:28] something that the devil cannot fake
[38:31] that's right now the devil can fake
[38:33] everything else he can fake coming to
[38:36] church and liking the worship and run up
[38:39] and down the aisle he can fake wanting
[38:41] souls to be saved he could fake he can
[38:44] fake everything else but he can't fake
[38:47] the word no he can't fake a real
[38:50] revelation of the
[38:52] word that's why when you get up in the
[38:54] morning and you're meditating on the
[38:56] word in the morning and you you start
[38:57] reading your Bible and and God just
[38:59] comes down you you know you feel that
[39:01] presence of the Lord and you start
[39:02] reading the Bible this this scripture is
[39:04] from me this scripture is going to help
[39:06] me today and it starts meaning something
[39:09] to you oh that's God that's something
[39:11] that can only come from God
[39:14] Amen cuz the devil can't fake a
[39:17] revelation Satan is a faker and a
[39:20] deceiver impersonating gifts and tongues
[39:25] and religion y and churchianity but he
[39:29] cannot impersonate the living revealed
[39:32] word amen no he can impersonate
[39:34] everything else brother but not the
[39:36] living revealed word amen now brother
[39:38] Brown said Satan can interpret anything
[39:41] he wants to and impersonate any kind of
[39:44] a gift he said I hope you're learning
[39:47] but he can't know this it's not even
[39:50] written in the word it's a total secret
[39:54] how can he not know this because it's a
[39:56] revelation right man you're only going
[39:58] to get this by knowing the author by
[40:01] Falling In Love With God by being able
[40:03] to read between the lines and that's
[40:06] something the devil can't fake I mean
[40:08] the devil yeah the devil can't fake so
[40:11] Satan Satan can't understand he can't
[40:13] apprehend he can't comprehend he can't
[40:15] know what a Believer knows if you're a
[40:19] real genuine believer sitting here
[40:20] tonight you got something that the devil
[40:22] can't the devil can't even prob at the
[40:25] Devil the devil don't know nothing about
[40:27] what a genuine Holy Ghost filled
[40:29] believer knows
[40:31] tonight and a revelation ain't fake
[40:34] right it it can it it can't come by Fai
[40:38] it's not given by a faker a revelation
[40:41] can only come by God Amen oh see
[40:44] sometimes we make we make things so
[40:46] complicated in the Bible but look how
[40:47] simple it is but brother R preached
[40:49] Christ revealed in Simplicity hidden in
[40:51] Simplicity revealed and the same and we
[40:53] make it so complicated and then you look
[40:55] at your own life and think how how how
[40:57] simple your life is you're just as
[40:59] simple as a Manger as a little stable
[41:02] and God God will come down in that
[41:04] stable and revealed himself and he can
[41:05] come down in your heart and reveal
[41:07] himself and that's as simple as the
[41:08] seals is that God can come down and hide
[41:11] himself in the Simplicity of your life
[41:14] and we'll make it all complicated as
[41:16] complicated as can be but it's so simple
[41:18] that God can come down and Tabernacle in
[41:20] your life and reveal himself in you
[41:22] reveal himself in a little church in
[41:24] Lula Georgia in the middle on the side
[41:26] of the road and what is this
[41:28] here y'all y'all changing things up on
[41:32] me all kinds of electronics back
[41:35] here and the first seal brother R said
[41:37] who is that white horse rider he said
[41:40] you're not blind you see who it is it's
[41:42] that Antichrist and that deceitful
[41:44] Spirit that's gone now and crept in so
[41:47] we got the genuine the genuine article
[41:50] and a fake amen the genuine and the fake
[41:54] so what the seal reveal it reveals how
[41:56] do I tell how how do I tell the
[41:58] difference right brother and what what's
[42:00] the story of my life how do I get rid
[42:02] rid of iniquity all those things all
[42:04] those I I I'm I'm going lay that to the
[42:07] side for now it's all right he said
[42:10] brother R said now seeing all this
[42:11] accumulation of evidence that the hour
[42:14] that we now live in I think it's a good
[42:17] thing to rehearse these things and to
[42:19] draw them out since the seals has been
[42:21] opened and find out the truth of these
[42:23] things as God has been so loyal to us
[42:26] with his great to show us these things
[42:29] he said I want you to know us here in
[42:30] Matthew 24 Jesus used the term of
[42:35] Christ
[42:36] Christ's not Christ but Christ's plural
[42:41] not singular Christ therefore the word
[42:44] Christ means the anointed one amen and
[42:47] then if it's anointed there will be not
[42:50] only one but many anointed the anointed
[42:53] ones see a false Christ brother what's
[42:57] anointed ones have to do with the first
[42:59] te seal it's fake it's fake and an
[43:02] anointed one is something that's fake
[43:05] amen a false Christ a faker somebody
[43:09] that's faking they love going to church
[43:11] and they love the worship and they love
[43:12] praise and and and maybe they they love
[43:15] doing doing what they believe they
[43:17] they're doing for the kingdom of God but
[43:19] down on the inside is fake and all down
[43:21] through the scripture you can see those
[43:23] two Vines Twisted together all the way
[43:25] from Cain Cain love going to church chur
[43:27] he loved offering his sacrifice balam
[43:30] loved he was a prophet of God he and his
[43:32] prophecy was true but his message was
[43:34] wrong you see the prophecy was correct
[43:38] but the message was wrong how do you
[43:40] tell what's wrong the message the word
[43:43] that the thing down on the inside is all
[43:46] cankered and twisted and wrong but on
[43:48] the outside they're in church and
[43:50] they're loving the seven altars and that
[43:52] bam had all the worship and everything
[43:54] was just looked just right along with
[43:57] what what what the real true genuine was
[43:59] but there was something lacking and he
[44:01] said a false Christ is a false anointed
[44:04] because Christ is the anointed there
[44:06] will be false anointed ones and they'll
[44:09] call themselves
[44:11] prophets but how will you recognize them
[44:14] by the word that's how you know it by
[44:17] the word whether they are right how will
[44:19] we recognize them will be by the word
[44:23] amen they might heal the
[44:25] sick they might Open the Eyes of the
[44:28] Blind and deny the word stay away from
[44:32] it amen don't care what it is stay with
[44:35] that word regardless amen because many
[44:38] times I've seen Voodoo and all kinds of
[44:40] things take place under healing so what
[44:43] what's he saying now you you might be
[44:45] all covered in oil but what's the oil
[44:49] covering that's right you take some oil
[44:52] and you put it over a cocko bur yeah and
[44:54] there's still a cocko bur underneath
[44:56] there
[44:57] and that's what happens sometimes people
[44:59] come to church you'll go to a good old
[45:00] camp meeting and you get real covered
[45:03] over in oil and then you leave the camp
[45:05] meeting and wonder like that question
[45:07] brother R asked how do I overcome you
[45:10] just keep slipping back and you know you
[45:13] go to a good Revival and you come back
[45:16] but you slip back and looking at
[45:17] pornography you slip back and talking
[45:20] dirty you slip back into cussing you
[45:23] slip back into your old friend group you
[45:26] just slip back and you just can't live a
[45:28] real genuine Christian Life it's because
[45:30] you got the oil covering over something
[45:32] that's fake you your message is is your
[45:35] message the word in your heart ain't
[45:38] there what it is is the devil's in there
[45:41] and and you know you got to get the
[45:43] devil kicked out cuz you can't give the
[45:45] devil the Holy Ghost how you going to
[45:47] give the devil the new birth you got to
[45:49] get him kicked out amen you got to kick
[45:51] him out first and and to kick him out
[45:54] what's what what does it take to kick
[45:56] him out you got got to put something in
[45:57] there and you put you put the word get
[46:00] the real word of God down in your heart
[46:03] and you watch The Devil can't stand
[46:07] around you know sometimes this might be
[46:10] a little silly silly way to put it but
[46:11] we we talk about honed houses sometimes
[46:14] and uh how you go to you know we we kind
[46:17] of maybe joke about how you know if
[46:19] there was if I saw the door to my house
[46:22] being open and closed or whatever I'd
[46:24] get busy and I'd be playing tapes in my
[46:26] house house I'd be pray I would you know
[46:29] you don't you you wouldn't put up with
[46:30] with something like I think brother
[46:31] Wayne Lawson was preaching along those
[46:33] lines he said if if if I if I knew there
[46:35] was a my house was haunted it it's time
[46:38] for the devil to get out well well what
[46:40] if your house what if your your your
[46:42] natural house is haunted if the devil
[46:45] was in your natural house it it behooves
[46:47] us to get busy and and figure out a way
[46:49] to get him out now if playing tapes and
[46:53] setting the atmosphere in a in a haed
[46:55] house could get that spook out if you
[46:58] start singing songs of praise and
[47:00] worship it'll get that spook out well
[47:02] what about the spook in your soul if you
[47:04] want to get rid of him you start
[47:06] meditating on the things of God you
[47:07] start reading your Bible and and and and
[47:10] and listening to sermons and thinking
[47:12] about the things of God and and lay
[47:14] aside all that gobbly goo of the world
[47:16] just forget watching all the Marvel
[47:18] movies and all the all the Tommy Ro that
[47:21] your friends want you to look at and you
[47:22] watch The Devil the devil leave the
[47:24] devil's going to have to leave because
[47:27] the word will boot him out yes sir well
[47:29] the strong man comes to the house and
[47:31] there there might be a strong man that
[47:33] he's as Jesus told that Parable he's got
[47:35] all his treasures and everything but
[47:36] when a stronger than him comes to the
[47:38] house you got to go you got to go and
[47:41] that's that's how you cast out Devils is
[47:43] the word will cast The Devil out every
[47:45] time you see somebody might you know a
[47:48] young person might come up and say well
[47:50] I I want to get free of whatever the
[47:52] spirit is and you you can pray over them
[47:54] and you can pour oil on them and all
[47:56] those kind of things things but if
[47:57] there's a cocklebur under that they're
[47:59] just going to go right back to the thing
[48:01] what what you got to do is just lay
[48:03] under the F I'm talking about the
[48:04] Fountain of the word you get busy get
[48:06] busy and get busy with kicking that
[48:09] thing out and you watch you watch God
[48:11] begin to get a hold of your life and God
[48:14] begin to take over and that's what's
[48:15] revealed in the seals how God will take
[48:18] over your life it's a takeover now now
[48:21] either the devil's going to take over or
[48:23] God's going to take over you can let you
[48:25] can let the devil take over your life or
[48:28] you can let God take over and how you
[48:30] let God take over is you get in the word
[48:33] and just lay under the word just get get
[48:35] in the word fall in love with Christ
[48:38] draw nigh unto him and He will draw nigh
[48:41] unto you and you watch him just begin to
[48:43] take care of all the
[48:45] problems you might be covered in oil but
[48:48] what's the oil covering a grain of weed
[48:50] or a
[48:51] cleur and how you tell the difference is
[48:55] what's the message what's the messag
[48:58] Peter on the day of Pentecost come out
[49:00] with a message he began to preach Jesus
[49:02] and tell him how repent and be baptized
[49:04] in the name of Jesus Christ and he had
[49:06] that was his message cuz that was what
[49:08] was under the oil but but the Pharisees
[49:11] they come out why are you healing
[49:13] somebody on the Sabbath cuz that was a
[49:15] nasty old cucker a nasty old something
[49:19] underneath it like just trying to do
[49:21] good but yet doing evil without even
[49:23] realizing it doing evil thinking they're
[49:25] doing good cuz it was a cabore something
[49:27] nasty and horrible even though they
[49:29] might have been anointed by the genuine
[49:31] Holy Ghost even though like uh Caiaphas
[49:34] was anointed when he spoke that uh what
[49:38] was it about
[49:40] uh yeah one one one must die I'm drawing
[49:44] a blank exactly how but anyway he he
[49:47] prophesied cuz he was covered the the
[49:49] anointing was on him and he spoke
[49:51] something that was true but yet the Jews
[49:54] went ahead and killed Jesus so what
[49:56] message is
[49:58] underneath brother R will say anointed
[50:00] one is one with a message and the only
[50:03] way the message can be brought out is by
[50:05] one that's anointed amen and that would
[50:08] be a prophet anointed amen there shall
[50:10] rise false anointed teachers anointed
[50:14] teachers but with an but anointed people
[50:16] with false teaching that's right
[50:18] anointed ones Christ plural prophets
[50:21] plural and if there is such a thing as a
[50:23] Christ singular than these would have to
[50:25] be anointed ones
[50:28] that their prophecy of what they were
[50:29] teaching would be the difference because
[50:32] they are anointed ones anointed on
[50:35] anointed a false message now so that
[50:38] begs the question now when we come to
[50:40] church what what do we come to church
[50:42] for you know there's a lot of people
[50:44] that come to church because they they
[50:46] they like they like the bait on the hook
[50:48] they like the the food that we serve
[50:51] they like the coffee downstairs they
[50:52] like they like the Happy atmosphere
[50:55] where we we throw our we give you love
[50:57] and we we you give you we give you that
[50:59] good old gospel hug and we we we draw
[51:02] you into our fellowship and everything
[51:04] there's people that come for that
[51:06] there's people that come because they
[51:07] want they want to share their story and
[51:08] they want people to hear and listen to
[51:10] them and fellowship but but those things
[51:14] can be faked those things can be good
[51:16] it's good it's good to fellowship and
[51:18] get in the anointing but what what about
[51:21] the main thing the main thing is to fall
[51:24] so in love with God Amen and so in love
[51:27] with the word that when somebody rubs
[51:29] you the wrong way you don't just give up
[51:30] and go away and turn around to fall so
[51:33] in love with god Till It's God that
[51:35] you're in love with not the church not
[51:37] the people that might betray you and
[51:38] might might deceive you and might do
[51:40] something wrong to you it might hurt
[51:41] your feelings but it's God it's God that
[51:44] you've got to fall in love with it's the
[51:46] word that you got to fall in love with
[51:49] the word it's the relationship with the
[51:51] word that's the real thing that's the
[51:53] real genuine thing that will carry you
[51:55] through when all else fails men will
[51:58] fail you people will fail you people
[52:01] will go different ways things of life
[52:03] will happen but there's one that will
[52:05] stick closer to you than a brother and
[52:07] that's the word that's Jesus
[52:12] Christ so now now that's what we're
[52:14] trying to get you to when you come to
[52:16] church to not draw you to a particular
[52:18] place or a particular person or group or
[52:22] a movement or anything like that but to
[52:24] Jesus Christ cuz if you get in touch
[52:26] with with Jesus Christ oh if you get
[52:28] with Jesus Christ he'll make everything
[52:31] different don't you want to be with
[52:32] somebody that can boot that devil out
[52:34] that can kick that devil out and change
[52:36] your life and change your nature and
[52:37] make you something real and something
[52:39] genuine and reveal these seals to you
[52:42] that Something's Happened in your life
[52:44] that God is on the scene something real
[52:46] and something true and that is not a
[52:49] fake oh we don't want fakers we want
[52:52] something genuine and we've got a recipe
[52:54] for a real genuine Christian Life laying
[52:58] here in the pages of the Bible and the
[53:00] pages of this message that God has given
[53:02] us in this day and what look at what a
[53:05] false message will bring a resurrection
[53:07] without death or you can have a
[53:09] resurrection but you don't have to die a
[53:13] false message birth without dying out
[53:15] maturity without suffering it all sounds
[53:18] good but it's wrong shaking hands with
[53:21] an Elder's evidence God can't do it but
[53:23] you can like Satan told even the the
[53:26] days of Miracles are passed see well you
[53:30] can be Anointed with a real genuine Holy
[53:33] Ghost but the message would be wrong and
[53:36] the message is what proves whether it's
[53:38] genuine or whether it's fake amen the
[53:41] rain falls on the just and the
[53:43] unjust now listen to this Parable that
[53:46] Jesus told in Matthew Chapter 5 he said
[53:48] I say unto you love your enemies bless
[53:51] them that curse you do good to them that
[53:54] hate you and pray pray for them which
[53:57] despitefully use you and persecute you
[54:00] now listen to how Jesus explains this
[54:03] that ye may be the children of your
[54:04] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[54:07] his son to rise on the evil and on the
[54:10] good think about what a good God we have
[54:13] that there can be somebody terrible he
[54:14] made his son to rise on Hitler he made
[54:17] his son to rise on
[54:19] musolini so he's saying if I can do that
[54:22] why can't you and he sendeth rain on the
[54:26] just and the unjust amen we've got such
[54:29] a good God that he'll send his anointing
[54:32] on an unbeliever in the church he'll
[54:34] send his anointing on a faker maybe
[54:36] somebody that won't ever ever really
[54:39] come to the true knowledge of the truth
[54:40] but yet God is so good that he'll give a
[54:42] blessing in church he maybe maybe he'll
[54:45] heal he healed him in a prayer line
[54:47] because that's that's the kind of good
[54:48] God that we have he sends his reain on
[54:52] the just and the unjust so what's that
[54:56] what's the parable that we can get
[54:57] what's the message we can get out of
[54:58] that if God can bless the faker why
[55:00] can't
[55:02] you if God can be good to a faker why
[55:04] can't
[55:07] you and brother R said now someone might
[55:10] say to me do you believe that that
[55:11] anointing on those on those people means
[55:13] that it's the anointing of the Holy
[55:14] Spirit yes sir the genuine holy spirit
[55:19] of God upon a person and yet they are
[55:23] false that the genuine holy spirit of
[55:26] God can be on a person and they're fals
[55:29] both the weed and the weeds live by the
[55:31] same anointing from Heaven both of them
[55:33] Rejoice over it the same holy spirit
[55:36] that anoints the church get that gives
[55:39] them desire to save
[55:41] Souls that gives them the power to
[55:44] perform
[55:45] Miracles it falls on the unjust the same
[55:48] as the just the very same spirit so that
[55:53] means that the same spirit that makes
[55:56] you want to go to church can make an
[55:58] anointed one want to go to church The
[56:00] Same Spirit the same Holy Ghost spirit
[56:02] that makes you want to see Soul saved
[56:05] can make an anointed one want to see
[56:08] Soul saved I remember my dad telling the
[56:11] story of growing up in the in the Church
[56:12] of God of Prophecy and he said he got in
[56:14] the car he's just a little fell and he
[56:15] got in the car with this preacher and he
[56:17] said uh uh boy if you want to if you
[56:21] want to know how to make
[56:22] money then be a
[56:24] preacher but those people are anointed
[56:27] they want to help and they want to see
[56:29] Souls saved but their message is wrong
[56:32] their their motives and their objectives
[56:33] and everything is wrong because they're
[56:35] in it for the wrong things they're
[56:36] trying to they but they they want to go
[56:38] to church they want to see they want to
[56:41] see Soul saved that same holy ghost that
[56:44] makes you want to see a sinner saved can
[56:46] make an anointed one the same holy ghost
[56:48] that makes you want to worship and want
[56:50] to praise God and makes you want to be
[56:52] in the atmosphere can make an anointed
[56:54] one I want to worship right now see see
[56:57] why the scripture says it can be close
[56:59] it can be so close that same holy ghost
[57:03] that makes you want to help somebody can
[57:05] make an anointed one want to help
[57:07] somebody that same holy ghost that makes
[57:10] you want to sing in church can make an
[57:11] anointed one want to sing a special in
[57:13] church right but be false amen a false
[57:17] believer or a false teacher oh it's that
[57:21] word it's that Incorruptible seed down
[57:23] on the inside that makes you real or gen
[57:25] or or or fake the devil the devil is on
[57:29] the
[57:30] inside now what what and I'm not going
[57:33] to stay long tonight we'll be closing in
[57:35] just a minute but what how do how do we
[57:38] get that devil out that's what's in
[57:41] revealed in the seal how do you get the
[57:43] devil
[57:44] out if the devil's on the inside and
[57:47] he's the one that's making you fake
[57:50] making you act wrong and do
[57:52] wrong rejoice in church and worship in
[57:55] the spirit and like going to church but
[57:57] when you get home you act different and
[57:59] you can't treat your right wife or your
[58:01] husband right and you you're just
[58:03] horrible come on brother can't stay away
[58:05] from those sites on the internet that
[58:06] you shouldn't be looking at can't stay
[58:08] away from from alcohol or vaping or
[58:11] whatever whatever it is all those vices
[58:13] you just can't overcome cuz that Cocker
[58:15] is there and it's something wrong how
[58:17] you going to get that thing
[58:19] out that's why the first seal says
[58:21] there's a lion the lion went out how do
[58:24] you defeat the Devil that line is the
[58:27] word of God and you defeat the Devil
[58:30] every time by it is written it is
[58:32] written now what did Brother Brown say
[58:35] in the greatest battle ever fought
[58:36] everybody's got their eggshell that they
[58:38] got to get out and how do you get out of
[58:39] that eggshell whatever your eggshell is
[58:41] tonight you're going to come out just
[58:43] like an eagle does with your mouth
[58:46] speaking the word of God Amen you ain't
[58:48] going to come out speaking all kinds of
[58:50] negativity I don't think I don't think
[58:52] I'll ever be anything I don't think I
[58:55] don't think God's still moving in the
[58:57] church I don't think I'll ever be healed
[59:00] you're going to come out speaking his
[59:01] word amen if you're going to come out
[59:03] you're going to come out speaking it is
[59:05] written and that's how you going to get
[59:06] the devil out by speaking his word
[59:08] accepting his word believing it and you
[59:10] watch The Devil lead that's that's what
[59:12] in Proverbs chapter 16 it says by Mercy
[59:15] and Truth iniquity is Pur that's how you
[59:18] get rid of iniquity you get rid of it by
[59:20] Mercy and Truth oh if you can come with
[59:23] god with confidence like Paul said come
[59:24] with boldness believe belie in that he
[59:26] is a god of Mercy that when his Spirit
[59:29] begins to move it's moving with
[59:30] forgiveness if you come with a repentant
[59:33] humble heart that God will get to move
[59:35] and and you come Believing on his truth
[59:38] and you lay that your confidence in his
[59:40] Mercy with his truth there and you watch
[59:42] and see if you're your iniquity what's
[59:44] iniquity iniquity is something where you
[59:46] know you shouldn't be doing it you know
[59:48] you shouldn't be looking at those
[59:50] websites you know you shouldn't be
[59:52] living the way you are but you can't
[59:54] help it because you're a bur you
[59:57] just can't help it so you're going to do
[59:58] what a bur does you can't help it
[1:00:02] oh you what a fix that sin has put us in
[1:00:06] to know that you shouldn't do things but
[1:00:08] yet you do them anyway Bo but when God
[1:00:10] comes on the scene and Boots the devil
[1:00:12] out then you can do what God's word says
[1:00:14] and then you can walk in his word and
[1:00:16] live a straight holy life a straight
[1:00:20] separated holy life like all of these
[1:00:22] Saints in the Bible that we read about
[1:00:24] yes amen Moses and Aaron and
[1:00:28] Abraham see there it is some people come
[1:00:30] to church for the food and the
[1:00:31] fellowship and a pat on the back and
[1:00:34] somebody kind of bless the way that
[1:00:36] they're living and telling them they
[1:00:38] they're being a real good Christian
[1:00:39] isn't that how some people they want to
[1:00:40] get in favor with the minister so that
[1:00:43] the minister can say that you're doing
[1:00:45] all right oh but if you could get in
[1:00:47] favor with
[1:00:48] God don't seek favor from a minister or
[1:00:52] somebody you you know I I I I I
[1:00:55] meditated on us story that brother Ram
[1:00:56] told about the the the person in the
[1:00:59] symphony that they were playing up on
[1:01:00] the stage they were playing the violin
[1:01:02] and and and they at the end when they
[1:01:05] they finished their what they were
[1:01:07] playing they got a big Standing Ovation
[1:01:10] but the only one that they were
[1:01:12] interested in was their teacher now see
[1:01:16] the only the only we should only be
[1:01:18] interested in what God thinks of us so
[1:01:21] many times you'll hear negative feedback
[1:01:24] or positive feedback you know you preach
[1:01:26] a sermon and somebody won say I don't
[1:01:28] like that well might maybe they'll say
[1:01:30] well I think you're a really good
[1:01:31] preacher but you always you got to put
[1:01:33] those in their own special boxes cuz
[1:01:35] really ultimately don't matter except
[1:01:38] for what God thinks about you it really
[1:01:41] don't matter what the minister thinks
[1:01:42] about you or what your friend thinks
[1:01:44] about you what matters is what God
[1:01:45] thinks you about you so when you come to
[1:01:47] church don't come for the pat on the
[1:01:49] back but come for the revealed word
[1:01:51] because that's the thing that matters
[1:01:54] that's the thing that'll make you real
[1:01:56] genuine a real genuine believer it's a
[1:01:59] revelation of the word that's changing
[1:02:00] us and keeping us now that's what Paul
[1:02:03] said Paul said in 2 Thessalonians that
[1:02:06] that Faker that deceiver was already
[1:02:11] working the mystery of iniquity way back
[1:02:15] in that very first church age deceivers
[1:02:19] deceiving the people off into something
[1:02:22] yes a spirit working to deceive
[1:02:25] something fake
[1:02:26] working to the a spirit teaching
[1:02:28] something wrong about the New Birth
[1:02:31] teaching something oh you teach
[1:02:33] something wrong about the new birth and
[1:02:34] how you going to have a new a real
[1:02:36] genuine New Birth if it's just if it's
[1:02:37] all if the if the real if the real
[1:02:40] pathway is not laid out for you then it
[1:02:43] just messes everything up because the
[1:02:44] message is wrong and that's what the
[1:02:46] Antichrist is that Faker that Spirit of
[1:02:50] deception moving the spirit of deception
[1:02:53] moving and an anointed one an anointed
[1:02:56] one that ain't genuine they're anointed
[1:02:59] by the genuine Holy Ghost but their
[1:03:01] message is
[1:03:05] wrong Boy you know you hear good old
[1:03:07] gospel preaching that's right that out
[1:03:10] that ought to make a real Holy Ghost
[1:03:12] filled believer really
[1:03:16] Rejoice I I was talking to my wife the
[1:03:18] other day there's some real believer
[1:03:21] some real preachers around the message
[1:03:23] that I really hold in high regard but
[1:03:25] because of their stand and because they
[1:03:27] study and so forth but it seems like
[1:03:29] everywhere you go people don't really
[1:03:31] grasp what they've got I I was talking
[1:03:34] to my wife about some people at at
[1:03:36] another church way away from here many
[1:03:38] many states away from here and and the
[1:03:40] people were there were some people in
[1:03:42] the church oh man if you knew who I was
[1:03:45] talking about I I really admire this
[1:03:47] preacher but there's people in that
[1:03:49] church that are like I I just want to go
[1:03:51] back home I just want it's because
[1:03:54] everywhere you go people don't really
[1:03:55] realize what they got but if you really
[1:03:58] realize the treasure that you got with
[1:04:01] some real some real gospel preaching
[1:04:04] that where you got some ministers that
[1:04:05] will really
[1:04:07] study
[1:04:08] oh
[1:04:11] and and and I ain't trying to build
[1:04:14] nobody up not trying to build myself up
[1:04:16] I'm just trying to say it is what it is
[1:04:19] if you got some real genuine gospel
[1:04:21] preaching you ought to appreciate it you
[1:04:24] ought to appreciate all these brother
[1:04:25] brothers because because there's so much
[1:04:28] fake there's so much fake out there and
[1:04:31] and I've seen I've seen what fake does
[1:04:33] just up up there where we were this past
[1:04:36] weekend they they've been such through a
[1:04:37] such a horrible turmoil coming out of
[1:04:40] the uh well y'all know the the mess that
[1:04:42] came the great big Minister leaving the
[1:04:45] message and all the things that happen
[1:04:46] and it just caus fake fake causes such a
[1:04:50] mess oh but when you got a real genuine
[1:04:52] you ought to see people rejoice when
[1:04:54] they come out of that and they've got
[1:04:56] real genuine gospel preaching they
[1:04:59] really appreciate it on their feet the
[1:05:01] whole service I'm not saying y'all need
[1:05:02] to be on your feet and everything but
[1:05:04] it'd be nice
[1:05:09] but oh but oh but when you when you see
[1:05:12] something real genuine it's something to
[1:05:14] be
[1:05:15] appreciated brother R said in the
[1:05:17] anointed ones at the end time he said
[1:05:18] these trees the True Vine and false Vine
[1:05:21] he said you've heard me preach on that
[1:05:22] since from years ago how they've grown
[1:05:24] up together brought them in individuals
[1:05:27] and showed that from Cain and Abel the
[1:05:29] two vines that met at an altar right
[1:05:32] both of them religious both of them
[1:05:34] anointed both of them Desiring life and
[1:05:37] worshiping the same God and one was
[1:05:40] rejected and the other were received why
[1:05:43] why was Abel received and Cain rejected
[1:05:46] they both were religious they both were
[1:05:48] at church they both were worshiping they
[1:05:50] both brought their sacrifice the way the
[1:05:52] best way they thought they could and he
[1:05:54] said the only one that the only way that
[1:05:56] the one was received could have done
[1:05:58] anything different from his brother it
[1:06:00] was revealed to him for the Bible said
[1:06:03] by Faith by faith Abel offered unto God
[1:06:07] a more excellent sacrifice than that of
[1:06:09] Cain which God testified that he was
[1:06:13] righteous amen right what is faith faith
[1:06:16] is something that's revealed to you amen
[1:06:19] now now Faith if we really want to nail
[1:06:21] it down faith when you got a
[1:06:23] revelation you're going to Cast Away
[1:06:25] everything else that's contrary to that
[1:06:27] if God really reveals to you that you
[1:06:30] are healed it don't matter what the
[1:06:32] doctor says that's right it don't matter
[1:06:34] what the skeptic says in the parking lot
[1:06:37] well is it really for you it don't
[1:06:39] matter CU God revealed it to you that's
[1:06:43] what faith is Faith when when God really
[1:06:46] reveals to you that you're going to take
[1:06:48] a body change it don't matter what the
[1:06:50] politicians are doing it doesn't matter
[1:06:53] what how close their finger is to the
[1:06:55] nuclear button it doesn't matter nothing
[1:06:58] matters when God really reveals
[1:07:00] something to you and now there's the
[1:07:01] definition of what faith is Faith is how
[1:07:05] you look at Ron Spencer that he can he
[1:07:07] can uh you know throw up 10 times before
[1:07:10] he gets behind the pulpit and then when
[1:07:12] he preaches it's Faith that's holding
[1:07:14] them up it's faith faith well fa Faith
[1:07:18] does not look at the circumstances I I
[1:07:21] was watching him this might be on the
[1:07:23] internet but anyway I I I I was watching
[1:07:26] him preach that prayer line at the
[1:07:28] Louisiana camp and I was thinking my
[1:07:30] that's got to be something Supernatural
[1:07:32] that he can preach for three hours
[1:07:34] knowing all the battles and the troubles
[1:07:36] and everything he's in now he's an
[1:07:39] example of faith faith will hold you and
[1:07:42] faith is faith faith is it's something
[1:07:46] that is revealed to you that is not yet
[1:07:48] but you believe it will be faith is a
[1:07:52] revelation of the will of God Amen you
[1:07:55] know what God wants done and all you got
[1:07:58] to do is just walk in it you know what's
[1:08:01] going to happen because God words God's
[1:08:04] word says so that's right and it's based
[1:08:06] upon the word of
[1:08:08] God you think the True Vine and the
[1:08:10] false Vine both had the same
[1:08:14] anointing the water fell on both of them
[1:08:18] no wonder he warned us it would deceive
[1:08:20] the very elected if it was possible they
[1:08:23] look the same they're anointed the same
[1:08:27] but notice by their fruit it's what they
[1:08:30] produce that tells you the difference
[1:08:33] the fruit will tell it now see look at
[1:08:35] balum now he come on the scene he made
[1:08:37] his prophecies his prophecies were
[1:08:39] correct the anointing was correct but
[1:08:41] his message was we're all the same and
[1:08:45] that ain't right you think about maybe
[1:08:47] maybe today the hour that we're living
[1:08:49] in the anointing could be on someone to
[1:08:51] speak a prophecy correct but if they
[1:08:52] tell you well you don't need to come to
[1:08:54] church anymore just stay home you know
[1:08:57] the message is wrong the message ain't
[1:09:00] right see that's how close it is
[1:09:03] somebody come on the scene and say well
[1:09:05] I'm I'm I I've got these credentials or
[1:09:07] whatever and people will fall for it
[1:09:09] hook like and S Line and Sinker because
[1:09:11] they don't really know what the message
[1:09:13] is and the message the Revelation is how
[1:09:16] you tell the difference amen the word
[1:09:20] what is the fruit the word for the fruit
[1:09:23] of the season and we'll close on that as
[1:09:25] a musicians come forth the word that's
[1:09:27] what it is their teaching the teaching
[1:09:30] of what the teaching of the Season what
[1:09:33] time it is man's Doctrine denominational
[1:09:36] Doctrine or God's word for the season
[1:09:40] amen right now aren't you glad this
