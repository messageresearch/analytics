[0:00] not caught up
[0:02] but uh we sure appreciate and I will get
[0:05] caught up with all of the lessons and
[0:08] preaching I think brother brother Aaron
[0:10] was working hard too two two Wednesday
[0:12] nights and then preaching from Brother
[0:13] pageant
[0:15] blessing she'll appreciate all the
[0:17] labors
[0:21] the way we left off was Hebrews 11.
[0:25] let's just go the Lord in prayer Lord
[0:27] God we're so grateful to be able to look
[0:28] into your word this morning Lord as we
[0:30] study these things out and and this uh
[0:32] chapter of the Hall of faith that Paul
[0:35] laid out for us as an example of what
[0:37] the things that we can have access to if
[0:39] we believe Lord I pray Lord that you'll
[0:40] just help us to understand Lord and to
[0:43] get our our hearts and Minds prepared
[0:45] for the the word to go forth and that
[0:47] you'll just be with brother Daryl Lord
[0:49] as he's studying Lord Jesus and
[0:51] preparing granted Lord that you'll just
[0:53] bless the services for us today we ask
[0:55] in your name amen
[0:59] so Hebrews 11 1 says now Faith is the
[1:02] substance of things hoped for the
[1:03] evidence of Things Not Seen
[1:07] and that's a a weighty thing to meditate
[1:10] on
[1:13] um you know when we were down there in
[1:15] Nicaragua there was a lot of things that
[1:16] we could uh that that uh that blessed us
[1:19] and a lot of things that that kind of
[1:22] um to think about but one thing I uh
[1:25] that really meant a lot to me was on the
[1:27] plane ride back I got to talking to this
[1:29] gentleman next to me and uh he turned
[1:32] out to be a missionary that was going
[1:34] down there and speaking to some people
[1:35] down there and and uh and uh one thing
[1:39] led to another and we we spent about two
[1:41] and a half hours just talking about the
[1:42] Lord and talking about uh
[1:45] preaching different things and
[1:47] and uh I got I got to talking to him
[1:49] about
[1:50] how that God is still a miracle working
[1:52] God and we started talking about that
[1:54] and and I I've never seen somebody
[1:56] choked up so much on not choked up but
[1:59] like crying but choked up like trying to
[2:01] trying to trying to swallow that God can
[2:04] is still a miracle-working God Amen now
[2:07] you think about what Paul led up to when
[2:09] he gets to Hebrews 11 he's he's laid the
[2:11] foundation of all these things that we
[2:13] to to to to to prove to us why we should
[2:16] trust the word of Jesus Christ and that
[2:19] we've not heard just the word of an
[2:21] angel or word of a minister but we've
[2:23] heard we've heard straight from God
[2:25] himself that's come down and and this is
[2:27] this man that came down as the the
[2:29] actual the um the essence of God like uh
[2:33] like brother Daryl was saying yesterday
[2:34] the the heart of God and and see all
[2:38] these things like like if you remember
[2:40] the last Sunday school listen that I
[2:42] preached when somebody tells you
[2:44] something uh there uh you wanna that I I
[2:48] guess the highest compliment you can
[2:50] give is just to believe what they say
[2:51] and so God wants us to believe what he's
[2:54] saying and uh I was thinking about just
[2:57] all of the all the messages that we
[2:58] heard in Nicaragua preached all you know
[3:01] Zach Wallace was down there preaching
[3:02] and brother Louise preached at the camp
[3:04] and just everything was based on just
[3:06] believe what God Said
[3:08] even brother Louise gave the example he
[3:10] got up and with the young people and
[3:12] said it's just like you he had a little
[3:14] dollar bill and he said if you if you
[3:15] just come up and take this dollar bill
[3:17] out of my hand because you believe I'm
[3:18] going to give it to you and somebody
[3:19] came up and took it but you know all
[3:22] these examples of just just believe just
[3:24] just have faith
[3:25] so when it says now Faith is the
[3:28] substance of things hoped for our faith
[3:29] is based upon God's word if you it seems
[3:32] like the hardest thing for us to do is
[3:34] just to accept what God has said about
[3:36] something if God said and you see when
[3:39] you read something in the Bible or you
[3:41] hear Brother Brown say it on the tape or
[3:43] you hear a preacher preach about it it
[3:45] is for you and that's the hardest thing
[3:47] for us to accept that that promise that
[3:50] when God made a promise is for you that
[3:52] it's not just something to learn about
[3:54] or to study on and memorize but it's for
[3:57] you
[3:57] so
[3:58] all of these promises that are laying
[4:00] here in the Bible that
[4:02] about healing about salvation about
[4:04] Deliverance everything that this laying
[4:07] there if you believe it like Abraham did
[4:10] and hang on to it
[4:12] then God is going to fulfill it and and
[4:15] I I believe fulfill it in a way that
[4:18] that uh like the last sermon I was
[4:20] preaching if it was yeah I preached it
[4:22] here too
[4:23] that if you believe something's going to
[4:26] happen
[4:27] I think that's what that gentleman on
[4:29] the plane was struggling with that that
[4:31] you know we we sometimes we have a an
[4:34] idea that when we come to church we're
[4:36] just kind of coming to learn and we say
[4:38] well we believe and and then not
[4:41] expecting something to happen not
[4:42] expecting our life to be changed not
[4:45] expecting our body to be healed but if
[4:47] you believe it's the substance of what
[4:50] you are hoping for it is the thing that
[4:53] you're looking for and it's based upon
[4:55] the promise of God that he made to you
[4:58] and if you believe if you really believe
[5:00] something is going to happen
[5:03] so it says now Faith is the substance of
[5:05] things hoped for the evidence of things
[5:06] not think seeing now you you think about
[5:08] what Paul's saying here in the Hebrews
[5:10] 11 he's laying down all these examples
[5:13] of people that believed and then
[5:16] something happened
[5:17] like he said in at the end of the
[5:20] chapter he said through faith these
[5:22] people subdued kingdoms
[5:24] now not just little bitty things happen
[5:27] but they they subdued kingdoms raw
[5:31] righteousness they obtained promises
[5:34] stop the mouths of lions in other words
[5:36] they did The Impossible what's what
[5:39] seemed like it just imp how are you
[5:41] going to stop the mouth of a lion you
[5:42] get thrown down into a lion pit and all
[5:44] the lines are sniffing around you and
[5:46] you have they haven't eaten in in weeks
[5:48] that is impossible but that same God
[5:51] that will stop the mouse of lions is
[5:53] still the same God today
[5:55] you see why brother Ram said that God's
[5:58] going to have a bride that does not
[5:59] doubt that he's the same yesterday today
[6:01] and forever and uh that that's why that
[6:04] conversation with that gentleman on the
[6:06] plane was so impactful to me because
[6:07] that's that really is a differentiator
[6:10] between what we believe in the message
[6:13] and what the denominational world looks
[6:15] at it that they really are struggling
[6:17] that he's the same yesterday today and
[6:19] forever that he's still a miracle
[6:21] working God and I wonder I wonder maybe
[6:24] if if we struggle with that that that
[6:27] we're not just coming to church to just
[6:28] warm the bench or keep the lights turned
[6:30] on but we're here to serve a god that is
[6:33] still active and that can still do
[6:35] something in our lives maybe let's let's
[6:38] set our mind that way as before the
[6:40] preaching of the word this morning
[6:41] before brother Daryl comes out that
[6:43] there's something something can happen
[6:45] if you really believe
[6:46] that is for you that God made the
[6:48] promises for you they quenched the
[6:51] violence of fire escaped the age of the
[6:53] sword out of weakness were made strong
[6:56] waxed violent and fight turned to flight
[6:59] the armies of the aliens women received
[7:02] their dead raised to life again
[7:05] and others were tortured not accepting
[7:08] Deliverance that they might obtain a
[7:10] better resurrection and others had trial
[7:14] of cruel mockings and scourgings yay
[7:16] moreover of bonds and imprisonment so
[7:19] see when you believe something's going
[7:22] to happen
[7:24] brother Brown said in questions and
[7:26] answers he said faith is the substance
[7:27] of things hoped for the evidence of
[7:30] things you do not see taste feel smell
[7:32] or hear but by faith when he catches the
[7:36] word
[7:37] it sends him into a dimension
[7:40] that makes it so real to him
[7:42] until he's just as good as God in his
[7:45] hand
[7:46] he knows it's going to happen
[7:49] now you see you rethink we read things
[7:51] like that and we think well if I can
[7:53] just work up Faith or whatever but but
[7:55] the Bible says faith comes by the word
[7:57] so it's not something you work up but
[7:59] it's something that automatically
[8:00] happens as you eat the word in other
[8:03] words you keep hearing these promises
[8:05] preached and you keep reading and it
[8:06] just builds up until something begins to
[8:08] automatically happen unto you that I
[8:10] know that if God promised it that he's
[8:12] able to make it come to pass
[8:14] and then it begins to build up into a
[8:16] substance where you got it even though
[8:19] even though you don't see it even though
[8:21] the skies are cloudy it doesn't matter
[8:23] because you got it and it's the
[8:25] substance that's that's why there's a
[8:28] lot of a lot of things that we can use
[8:29] as an evidence that manifestation
[8:31] jumping around lights and visions and
[8:34] dreams and that kind of stuff but the
[8:36] Bible says that those things are not the
[8:37] evidence faith is the evidence
[8:40] that's why faith is even the evidence of
[8:43] your new birth not that you jumped or
[8:45] ran down the aisles or something but you
[8:47] have something that trumps all of those
[8:49] things where you have a more sure order
[8:51] prophecy than being with Jesus or being
[8:53] with brother Branham that you know down
[8:55] in your heart that God has made
[8:57] something real to you yeah that is that
[9:00] is something that that nobody can take
[9:02] away from you it's something that's it's
[9:04] it's that is the evidence that's the
[9:06] evidence of the thing that you can't
[9:07] even see yet but you know that you
[9:09] already have it to your brother I'm
[9:12] sitting in the message persevere and he
[9:13] said how could a man ever have faith by
[9:16] putting his hand on a tree he would make
[9:17] him well you got to have faith in
[9:20] something see he was having a
[9:21] conversation with somebody and they said
[9:23] well I could I believe if I just put my
[9:24] hand on a tree or maybe you know put
[9:26] your hand on the pulpit you believe that
[9:28] you if you have faith in that you know
[9:30] but he said you got to have faith in
[9:32] something
[9:33] right you just you're not we're not
[9:34] having faith in just the air or some
[9:36] something that somebody told us like
[9:38] like just some man some man's idea
[9:41] but we're believing like Paul has laid
[9:44] out for us all the way up to Hebrews 11
[9:45] and what God Said Yes amen you see how
[9:49] it seems so simple sometimes when we
[9:51] preach it but it's that's what we're
[9:53] really battling out the greatest battle
[9:54] ever fought is is this promise for me is
[9:58] it all these things that we read about
[9:59] is it for me or not and we just sit here
[10:02] and we we maybe we get tired but but yet
[10:04] all of these promises if we can just if
[10:07] we can just simply believe what God Said
[10:09] just believe what he said and the Bible
[10:12] said Faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[10:15] the word of God that bases it your faith
[10:18] has got a foundation why
[10:20] because God promised it God promised it
[10:25] now you see one of my favorite
[10:26] scriptures in the Bible was the one we
[10:28] studied on in Hebrews chapter 6. and and
[10:31] boy that's something that'll preach that
[10:34] by two immutable things
[10:36] in which it was impossible for God to
[10:38] lie we have a strong consolation
[10:42] who have fled for Refuge to lay hold
[10:44] upon the Hope set before us
[10:46] God wants you to believe him so much
[10:49] that he gave us these two things that
[10:51] the god that cannot lie made a promise
[10:55] and we just we just kind of reiterate
[10:57] that over and over again that you can
[10:59] believe what God Said
[11:02] if God said that you can have the Holy
[11:05] Ghost you can have it if God said you
[11:06] can have the Capstone you can have it we
[11:09] just got to believe it
[11:11] now so we're basing we're basing our
[11:13] faith not on just some man's idea but on
[11:15] the word of God and you look through all
[11:17] these scriptures that I've got outlined
[11:18] here that prove to us that the word of
[11:21] God is not just a man's idea like II
[11:23] Timothy that says all scripture all
[11:26] scripture even Mark 16 that a lot of
[11:28] people want to toss out is given by
[11:30] inspiration of God and is profitable for
[11:33] Doctrine for reproof for correction for
[11:35] instruction and righteousness
[11:38] in Romans chapter 4 the the promise of
[11:40] Abraham was not all these things that
[11:42] were written about Abraham was not given
[11:44] for his sake alone that it was imputed
[11:45] to him but for us also if we can have
[11:48] faith like Abraham did it'll be imputed
[11:50] us for righteousness so these things
[11:52] that are written in the Bible were
[11:53] written for us yes
[11:55] Romans chapter 15 says for whatsoever
[11:57] things were written before time or
[11:59] written for our learning that we through
[12:01] patience and comfort of the scriptures
[12:03] might have hope
[12:05] that's right the second Peter says
[12:07] knowing this first that no Prophecy of
[12:09] the scripture is of any private
[12:10] interpretation that that's kind of an
[12:13] odd language to use but that means that
[12:15] it didn't come from just some somebody's
[12:16] idea it's not brother Bob's idea that
[12:20] he's preaching it's not bro even brother
[12:22] branham's idea it but it came from he
[12:25] said the Bible says that the prophecy
[12:27] came not an old time by the will of man
[12:29] but holy men of God spake as they were
[12:31] moved by the Holy Ghost
[12:33] so I think that should give us
[12:35] confidence this morning as we study out
[12:37] the scripture we're not studying out the
[12:39] ideas of a man but these are the this is
[12:42] by inspiration of the Holy Ghost
[12:46] and brother Brown would say over and I
[12:48] got all these lists of things he said
[12:50] about to build up our faith if God said
[12:52] it it'll be that way
[12:56] no matter how ridiculous it sounds if
[13:00] God said it he means it
[13:02] he is the way he keeps his word it's up
[13:05] to him to see it through not you to see
[13:08] it through it's him to see it through
[13:12] he keeps his word
[13:14] amen that chokes us up sometimes doesn't
[13:17] it I mean a lot we will say we believe
[13:19] it but do we really believe it do we
[13:21] really believe that he keeps his word
[13:22] when troubles come when Strife comes
[13:24] when we get in a little place of Despair
[13:26] or whatever do we really believe that he
[13:28] keeps his word yeah if God said it his
[13:31] characteristics will produce what he
[13:33] said
[13:34] and where can you put your faith on
[13:36] anything else but the word amen if God
[13:39] said it hold your finger to it that's
[13:43] true
[13:44] if God said it oh you see why the Bible
[13:47] is it's a life to a Christian because we
[13:50] it that's what that's where we get our
[13:52] strength and our our power and in the
[13:55] midst of of bad times because you can
[13:58] hang on everything that God said
[14:01] he said if God said it there's bound to
[14:03] be a womb somewhere for it to fall into
[14:07] another place he said how could we doubt
[14:09] it if God said it just as true as those
[14:12] Prophecies of Daniel had to be fulfilled
[14:14] as true as God lives every word has to
[14:18] be fulfilled
[14:19] and another place he said if God said it
[14:22] will be there he's able to put it there
[14:26] That's How Strong brother Branham
[14:28] believed in faith that if you believe
[14:31] that your pocket knife is going to be in
[14:33] your pocket if you believe it it'll be
[14:36] there
[14:37] see we get choked up sometimes by faith
[14:41] if God said it was going to rain and
[14:43] that meant it was going to rain you say
[14:45] it's the truth God said so if God said
[14:49] it that's right I believe it it's to me
[14:51] the faith anchors in my heart and I
[14:53] believe it and I call those things that
[14:55] are not as though they were because God
[14:58] said so
[15:00] that's what Paul meant when he said and
[15:02] faith is the substance of things hoped
[15:04] for the evidence of not Things Not Seen
[15:06] our faith is based upon the word of God
[15:07] how do you get Faith how do you get more
[15:10] faith you see I want I want more faith
[15:12] to overcome this morning well faith
[15:14] comes by hearing the word and then you
[15:16] do like in the greatest battle ever
[15:18] fought you do like that little eagle and
[15:19] you start confessing what Jesus said
[15:21] because you're not confessing the words
[15:23] of a man you're saying he said it he
[15:25] said it I believe it I believe
[15:28] I believe I'm Healed I believe I believe
[15:32] God gave the promise and you say it and
[15:35] you you're going to come out of that egg
[15:37] like the little Eagle did because you're
[15:38] saying his words oh you you try that and
[15:41] I challenge you and see if see if
[15:43] something don't start happening
[15:45] you take God at his word because if God
[15:48] said it his words are true amen amen and
[15:52] perseverance he said when a man gets his
[15:54] answer from God there is nothing going
[15:56] to stop him
[15:57] most people today as I will repeat
[15:59] myself from last night saying they have
[16:01] hope instead of Faith you find people
[16:03] coming on the platform they're just
[16:04] built up in hopes
[16:06] now I hope it's good because we want
[16:08] when you're in a bad spot you won't hope
[16:10] you want to be able to okay there
[16:12] there's a there's a way out
[16:15] but faith is when you got the way out
[16:18] faith is what hope is when you're
[16:20] looking for oh thank God God there's
[16:22] there's a there's a there's somebody
[16:24] that got the key that can get me out of
[16:26] my prison cell but faith is when you you
[16:29] got the way out
[16:31] faith is the substance of things hoped
[16:33] for the evidence it's not a myth it's
[16:35] not imagination it's something you've
[16:38] got
[16:39] you've already got it and you're just as
[16:41] happy with it that Faith you have as you
[16:44] would be if you have the substance in
[16:45] your hand
[16:47] oh you think about that now if you're if
[16:49] you're needing healing in your body this
[16:51] morning or whatever you know we got all
[16:52] kinds of needs I mean help with our
[16:54] paycheck help the food getting food on
[16:56] the table if you've got faith that'll
[16:59] make you happy because even though you
[17:01] don't see the manifestation yet you've
[17:04] already got it that that's why faith is
[17:07] so real that it's just it is the very
[17:09] evidence that the thing that you're
[17:11] believing in is coming
[17:13] and not because some imagination in your
[17:16] mind but because you know that God
[17:18] promised it yes you're basing it on what
[17:21] God promised
[17:23] and Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[17:24] today and forever he said faith is the
[17:26] subject right now that we have under
[17:28] consideration what is faith
[17:31] it's just as much different as it is day
[17:33] and night between Faith and Hope for the
[17:35] Bible in Hebrews the 13th chapter said
[17:37] for faith is the substance of things
[17:39] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[17:40] Seen it's not just a mythical hope it's
[17:43] absolutely a substance and he said oh I
[17:46] hope you see this and then you'll see
[17:49] things happen
[17:52] that's what separates us I believe we're
[17:56] believing something's going to happen
[17:58] if you if you maybe you've been going
[18:00] going through life and not expecting
[18:02] something to happen I hope that this
[18:04] morning that your your your mind your
[18:07] you will change that you're you got a
[18:09] different look on things this morning
[18:11] expects something to happen
[18:13] expect God to do great things in your
[18:15] life why because he promised it if he
[18:18] promised something if he promised it and
[18:20] it's laying there in the world now you
[18:21] might have to fight for it you might
[18:22] have to battle for it but it's yours and
[18:25] you can do like Caleb and say well God
[18:28] promised me this mountain so I'ma get it
[18:30] so this morning settle it in your mind
[18:33] if you need something from God settle it
[18:35] because if he made the promise he made a
[18:37] way for you to get it just believing
[18:40] all these all these scriptures in the
[18:42] Bible that build up our faith in Matthew
[18:44] 21 all things
[18:46] whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer
[18:48] believing ye shall receive
[18:54] does that choke us up like that fella on
[18:56] the plane that I was talking to
[18:57] if you need something in prayer and
[19:00] you've got the right motive and the
[19:02] objective and the right reason and you
[19:03] can align it up with God's word you're
[19:05] not just asking to win the lottery or
[19:07] something weird because based on your
[19:08] carnal desires but you can base it on
[19:11] the word you ask it in prayer and
[19:13] believe and you will get it
[19:17] I I was I got the preaching in Nicaragua
[19:20] and I started talking along those lines
[19:21] and I say it in my sermon that sounds
[19:24] fanatic that sounds a little bit crazy
[19:25] doesn't it and the world will say that's
[19:28] that's crazy talk
[19:30] but we're not we're we're we're based
[19:34] we're basing what we believe and what we
[19:36] say upon the word of God that's why for
[19:38] any man to say these things it would be
[19:40] a little bit a fanatical but God is the
[19:43] one that said it
[19:45] in Luke chapter 1 he said for with God
[19:47] nothing shall be impossible
[19:50] even that song that brother Brown used
[19:52] to come out on only believe all things
[19:54] are possible that's that's kind of the
[19:56] um the the theme song of message
[19:58] Believers is anything is impossible
[20:02] in second Corinthians we walk by faith
[20:04] and not by sight
[20:06] and Romans 10 says faith cometh by
[20:08] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[20:10] and Hebrews 11 that we just read and
[20:13] Hebrews 11 6 without faith it is
[20:16] impossible to to please him for he that
[20:19] cometh to God must believe that he is
[20:22] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[20:24] diligently seek him so if you're sitting
[20:26] here this morning I want to please God
[20:27] there's no way to even please him unless
[20:29] you believe what he's said
[20:32] if you believe what he said that's the
[20:34] way to please God
[20:36] that's how that's how to please anybody
[20:37] if I if I say something and my kids
[20:39] don't trust my word then then you know
[20:43] that's that hurts my feelings
[20:45] how much how much more for God if he
[20:47] tells us something and we doubt him
[20:50] Ephesians chapter 2 for by grace are you
[20:52] saved through faith and that not of
[20:54] yourselves it is the gift of God and
[20:56] Proverbs chapter 3 verse 5 to 6 says
[20:59] trust in the Lord with all thine heart
[21:00] and lean not unto thine own
[21:02] understanding and all thy ways
[21:04] acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy
[21:06] past
[21:07] if we're everything that we do is based
[21:09] on faith based on faith that if we just
[21:12] trust in God that he will lead us out
[21:15] and the angel of the Covenant brother
[21:18] Brown said don't be scared
[21:21] I hope in the last five minutes that we
[21:23] got five more minutes I hope these
[21:25] things that I'm saying are building up
[21:27] your faith as you're hearing them don't
[21:29] be scared he said that's the reason you
[21:31] can't receive
[21:32] is because you're afraid it won't happen
[21:36] see we we need to be expecting that
[21:39] something's going to happen
[21:42] we get scared that if we believe it
[21:44] won't happen and then you can't have
[21:46] faith that way right and if Faith cometh
[21:49] by here and he said maybe sickness has
[21:51] beat you down to a place you hardly
[21:53] haven't got any strength anymore
[21:54] maybe you're so blind you can hardly see
[21:57] you can't can't see maybe you're so sick
[21:59] you can't hardly get up but just apply
[22:02] that promise
[22:04] thus saith the Lord
[22:06] you said whatever things I desire when I
[22:10] pray believe I receive it
[22:12] for me to receive it and accept it as if
[22:15] it was already done
[22:17] now now let's let's apply that this
[22:19] morning if you've got a complex this
[22:21] morning if you can't uh exercise your
[22:24] gift in church because you got beat down
[22:26] or something and you got all these
[22:27] things Weighing on your mind
[22:29] there's a promise in the Bible that you
[22:31] can be delivered to that for me to
[22:33] receive it and accept it as if it was
[22:35] already done it's already done
[22:39] you realize what that means that that if
[22:43] you if you don't have to fight the
[22:45] battle the battle's already been fought
[22:48] for you the mighty conqueror has gone
[22:50] before and died on the cross for your
[22:52] healing for your salvation for
[22:54] everything and now all you got to do is
[22:55] just follow behind him and go go claim
[22:58] what he is already possessed now see
[23:01] y'all the hard part's already done
[23:04] for me to receive it and accept it as if
[23:07] it was already done believe it now for I
[23:10] have faith and faith is the substance of
[23:12] things hoped for the evidence of Things
[23:14] Not Seen
[23:15] I believe it Lord
[23:19] and faith comes by hearing he said God
[23:21] will look right down in your heart and
[23:23] see that promises that promise and
[23:26] diseases will melt back from side to
[23:28] side
[23:29] cripples will walk blind will see
[23:32] therefore here dumb will speak why they
[23:37] have taken God at his word
[23:39] yes sir Faith cometh by hearing and
[23:43] hearing of the word of God
[23:45] well brother Bob I don't think that's
[23:47] for me it is for you it's it's speaking
[23:51] about you whatever you have need of the
[23:54] promises of God are so great that no
[23:56] matter what your situation no matter
[23:58] what your trouble no matter what your
[24:00] mind battle
[24:02] the promises of God Trump everything no
[24:05] matter what the devil is heaped on your
[24:07] head no matter how long you've been sick
[24:09] the promises of God are true and we'll
[24:12] just stop right there faith is the
[24:14] substance of things hoped for the
[24:17] evidence of Things Not Seen
[24:19] and God bless you Saints
[24:22] [Applause]
[24:26] there you go
