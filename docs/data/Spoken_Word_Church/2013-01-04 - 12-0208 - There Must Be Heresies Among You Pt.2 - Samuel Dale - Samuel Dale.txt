thank in 1 Corinthians 11 verse 8 18 and 19 first of all when you come together in the church I hear that there be divisions among you and I'm partly believe it for there must need must be also heresies among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you now see it's not bad for things to come Among Us right as long as the holy spirit is there too amen keep us in the right thing right okay then we go over to 1 Peter 3:1 15 but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that askthis of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear amen you may be seated to the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now I announced for a while there that we were going to take some um doctrinal issues and things that some of the people of the message believe and try to to show you why we don't believe them and that's right and things like that now there's plenty of things that we do believe we do believe all the word of God Amen but there are some that have done just like all other uh religious uh groups or whatever you want to call them denominations and things they they're just the same way among us to where that that there's many people who believe different things and as your pastor I feel I'm obligated to just speak about those things you know at times because there may be new ones Among Us and and different things and a lot watching in on the internet and everything like that and they Wonder well what do you believe well as a one believer I believe that God's word is the answer to all things I believe it is is it's you know it's the answer so we go back into God's word to get our answer amen that's right it's not to what we just try to decide what's right or vote on what's right or you know opinions and thoughts and ideas are all fine but what does the word say that's the main thing that we want to talk about you know to keep it in line and as I said then there is many groups many people around the land that follow different things and I don't have anything against anybody what you follow as long as you don't try to make me believe it that's the difference in it when it comes down to try to make me believe what you think then I I might Rebel just a little bit and you know be just a tad bit stubborn about it because you know and I don't believe in doing like you can do we got a little old horse there now and you know she started out pretty stubborn when we first brought her up and brother Donnie told me how to handle her so you know I pet her and and give her a little extra attention and and give her a little you know couple of handfuls of some uh feed there you know and I've got her to where now I just go over there and I just call her name and she'll just come right on the where up at you know I go get the bucket and she goes into the barn well that's fine but uh I've never been one that uh you know that petting and and pampered made me get on the side of anybody right that's my point I I just I'm just not that way you can brag about me and say what you want to about me but it won't change what I think right and I'm going to just tell you what I think and in that way you don't have to worry about it you know nobody has to be concerned and say well what the say believe you just come and ask me and I'll tell you I won't to I won't borrow no holes and I'll tell you and we Bor we've took away the point we will not call names of people who have these doctrines but if you want to come to my office or atten around here to somebody they'll be glad to uh you know maybe tell you who this is that we're talking about but I don't believe it needs to be add out on the internet system because that's not good cuz you'll know when you bring out a Doctrine people of the message know what doctor and they've always tried to put me in some kind of a camp but I've just never been one that would that like to be that way I just like to be myself you know and I like to fellowship with everybody and just have a good time and you know just forget it and and let everything go and you don't agree with me that's fine but I wish you'd tell me you don't agree with me that's you know if people go out and tell everybody else that that you don't agree with with brother Dale well that's that's not good just come tell me about it or or call me or whatever you know somebody on the internet you you're welcome to it and make sure you do it before midnight and the night cuz I don't want to be up in the morning you know talking on the telephone and all with you but you know I I'm I'm open for inst instructiveness into her that I want to be right but now we covered a doctrine that was way on back many years ago and a lot of people are still following after it it was called two souls and the doctrine on point there was that God gave your soul and Satan gave your soul and and uh if you was capable of being born again you you got two because God gave you one and Satan gave you one and that way you just destroyed the one that Satan gave you and and you always was eternal well I I just couldn't see that I can't follow that point because uh you know I I believe the soul of man as I brought out to you is the part of you that's real right amen your body you say well my body it's real I can feel it but the soul is more real because the soul lives on after the body goes to the grave and will one day either be uh brought as to a lot of people will be be given eternal life or they will be cast into the Lake of Fire and that will be the death of the Soul which is what the Bible calls in the Book of Revelations the second death right all right so we covered that you know then we just picked a couple of topics to go across the line to kind of hold in that same form to see that you'll see that a lot of these doctrines come from one point that's right and that's the way it is there's no new doctrine there's uh you know all the doctrines was back in the in the Bible and you can go back in there and find them you know all the way back into Genesis and find all of the doctrines of mankind and and all like that and like I'm I've always said I I'm not against anybody I'm not against anybody for what they believe you know because uh we all have our own belief thoughts and ideas but what I'm against is people trying to teach other people the the the Bible the things when it's not in there right and then I just say well I just don't believe it you know uh my wife used to tell me that it was in the Bible that you wouldn't be able in the end of the time to be able to tell the the difference in the seasons except the of the the uh buding of the trees and the shedding of the leaves and I told her I said well honey I've read it through and I never found it you know it's not in there well I've got the computer systems if you want to check it you can run conord and things it's not in there and I told her I said the one reason it is because you always have summer and winter right you know that's going to remain until you know the it's over so that means you're going to have the shedding of the leaves and the budding of the trees and all and you've heard the old saying that every tub was sit on its own bottom well that's not in the Bible I want somebody to come show me you know that it's in there but see that's the way people to do they'll just say the Bible says oh yeah well at least tell me where it's at you know at least let me read it for myself and and that way then we'll talk about it amen but there was a Doctrine started years ago that kind of I believe came off of this two Soul point and uh it came down to a group of people and they they started teaching two Lords and uh in that then their Doctrine was uh accepted by a lot of people around the land and and you know in Foreign Fields and things like that and it's still going of believing that there's two Lords well I just happen to to remember in Ephesians 4 that the Bible says there's one Lord One Faith right and one baptism that's right well you know I just can't go along with that and uh you know Deuteronomy the the first commandment is what there's only one Lord we're commanded to love the Lord Our God not our Gods right right amen all right and and Zechariah says that there would be one Lord and one name amen and we can go through a lot of it in the Bible of doing and covering but you know there there is a Doctrine in the land of of organized religion is called trinitarianism and uh that doctrine of trinitarianism is to believe that there's three Gods well right then there's the doctrine of what you call the Oneness that you know they go to the the Trinity goes one way the Oneness go to The Other Extreme of being that Jesus was you know the last form of God or or coming down like father son Holy Ghost like your finger being one and I I I just can't seem to go along with that idea because of all of what the Bible is well then we thought we had it figured out because we thought we were in the middle and we'll get down to some points of interest in a minute about this and maybe it'll help but we thought we had it right when we were has tried to explain it that it was God in three persons y Blessed Trinity now there's no such thing in the Bible as the word Trinity right the word Trinity was adapted uh along up after um let's see I think I've got it in here but I'm not no but anyhow uh the word Trinity was adopted later I can give you the man's name you hold on a minute uh his name was t e r t u i l i a n and he pronounce it but he started teaching along about um Now Catch the point about 225 ad it was about 100 years before they had the what was called the Nan Council the first one 325 ad all right and the Trinity was was not in the Bible it's not very in in any form you know but they begin to teach it as a trinitarian concept along about 200 and something years after the death of the Apostles and you know I mean death of the Lord Jesus and uh it developed up until when actually you came to 3:25 I'm laying this in the line now to just show you why I don't believe in the two Lords because of the statement that they make of their Doctrine they actually make the statement cuz I heard the man personally he said that he believed Jesus was a different person from God he said God was one person Jesus was another person well if it's two persons it's two personalities that's right the two personalities is two individuals that's right and that's the reason I don't agree with it because that's see that's the reason I don't agree with the Trinity you say God in three persons Blessed Trinity well how can it be God in three persons a person is a personality a personality is an individual an individual is a person right that's simple and and I'm a ninth grade education person and I can understand it that way right right because see you can't put it together as being three Gods you said no we don't believe that but it's God in three persons Blessed Trinity see and this is their Doctrine co-equal and co-eternal well how can a son be e Co coeternal with the father and and you don't find that in the scripture see Jesus said unless you believe that I am he amen you'll die in your sin that's right even uh I'll get to it in a few minutes somewhere in here that you know that the devil believed in one God and trembles about about it that's where's that at that's uh James 2:9 right that Satan even believed in one God and trembled right yeah you know he was afraid he he knew what it was but yet see we we come up with the thought and idea of saying well we we can't understand it right well the Bible says the Eternal godhead it's in Timothy says the Eternal godhead can be understood by the things that we s that's right you right God doesn't leave us blinded he reveals himself in the scriptures and he hides himself that's why it's got to be revealed right amen but to look at it simply I I'm I'm one person all right I'm a father but you know what I'm a son of a father that makes me a son right man all right I'm a human being I'm Samuel Dale I'm a former employee of gentle Motors retired you know a pastor of a church uh Etc can come up with many many different titles that's right but I'm only one person right see I believe that God is many manifestations Father and Son and Holy Ghost is not three Gods right there three manifestations of the same God right and see being three manifestations then are the same God why would you want to go to two Lords about it why would you want to cover our thought an idea that there was two Lords that Jesus being one Lord and God being another Lord see it's mankind trying with their intellectual conception to figure out the word of God right amen well the Bible said it is of no private interpretation that's right now that's scripture and he said it can only be revealed the Bible says no man can call Jesus the Christ except it be by the Holy Ghost right now anybody with the ability to open their mouth and enough brain to be able to say Jesus is the Christ right that don't mean they're saved right no so that's not what it's talking about that's right it's not talking about just because you can say Jesus is the Christ it's when something within you shows you that's right amen right and it can only be done by God himself revealing it that's right so that's why man's tried to figure it out but like I said I'm many I have many manifestations you do too many manifestations in your life but you're only one person right amen God has many manifestations but he's only one person he's God see then we go along and we try to make it God the Father God the son God the holy ho ghost now how can that be because you're making it three persons right and see if you do believe in a trinitarian thought who is your savior right well Jesus is well then see you've left the father and the holy ghost out of it and according to the Bible it says that the Holy Ghost would come and live in you right right Jesus said I am my father right I'm quoting scriptures come on right I and my father will come and take our Abode in you well then it has to be that the father and the Holy Ghost is the self same person amen that's right and what they can't understand people about the godhead is is the basis of of the fact that God could come down create a body Hebrews 10:5 a body th has prepared me and when that body came forth in the wound of that virgin that was bed to to produce it right she never brought an egg right you didn't have an egg that would make the body come in from mankind cuz your egg your body comes to reproduction of the egg you know from the mother right all right and if it was true then that would make his body just like my body it wouldn't be you know a virgin born there'd be no need of it you might as well let it come from some other way let God come down cuz a lot of the Jews today believe that the Messiah this one died just back a few years ago about 90 years old up in New York that they a lot of the Jews believ that he was the Messiah cuz they believe that's what's going to happen God is going to come down and thenwell something but according to the Bible right the Bible said he was born Lord to Christ he was born Emmanuel according to the Bible oh yeah which means god with us all right now see then if if like I said like the brothers believe or the people believe that there's two Lords then where are you going to fit it in that's right where are you going to try to bring in right that there's one Lord for one thing and one Lord for another that's a trinitarian concept amen and what I've always said is on the point that we spent all of the years in this one brother that really uh teaches it was the one who uh edited or or wrote out the church age book and the church a book is vastly covered over the fact of one true and living God Amen and then after run around and leaves the scene he comes up with the idea that there's two Lords because he couldn't see the truth of one God that's right yeah well you could take his own book that he wrote to him and lay it down he' say well I didn't understand that well I agree with him he didn't understand it or he wouldn't believe it now but how can you have two Lords when as I quoted in Ephesians there it says there's one Lord right one Faith one baptism all right they said then what man has come up with the idea is that Jesus is one person substance identity and God is another yeah lord well now most people don't go back and read I I enjoy reading right always have and that was one of the things I guess God gave me uh you know I always love to read and uh even in school I I love to read but I hated to do book reports but uh I I love to read and uh I've always been that way when somebody says something I try to find out right amen so at all always been concerned and this has been many years it's been 40 something years ago right that I had an opportunity through a brother that had some of the pran fathers and the naan fathers books big old books you know great big things you know and and I I didn't read all of it but I wanted to know what was you know why was it coming up with a trinity and where it came from Jo I went back in there and I begin to read and study on those things to see and I come to find out that most people don't even know what happened at the first Nan council at 325 ad they think it was arguing over three gods or one it was not right I've read it and I quoted I gave you a quote out of it to where that you could could do it and be glad for you if all you got to do is just put nicely in counsil and click on your computer amen and you can read for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks on the Nan Council because the books are like that and great big volumes of them you know all right so you have an opportunity to find out where it comes from but I went in there and I began to study it and I thought well where does this Trinity concept come from and as I begin to read and study on it I found out the man's name and they gave you a moment ago that he he started with the word Trinity but when they come to the Nan Council it was not an argument over whether there was one God or three Gods the trinitarian concept had not taken hold was already beginning to be taught but hadn't taken hold but what had what took hold was there was a man named Aras and there was a man that was his name was elexander and he didn't even go to didn't debate it he had a a deacon that was in his evidently his church and he is something about R atheist or something like that and they were the two basic people at Nan Council 325 ad in their discussion well arus was basically holding to the one true and living God concept trying to hold on to it but yet I'll agree that even at that time time if you read it closely that the thoughts had already begin to impregnate their mind at NAA even those with the truth because they were beginning to think about and considering the fact of Jesus being an eternal son that was already beginning to to to get in and how can you have an eternal son that's not even sensible you know sons are not Eternal they're begotten that's right all right and as I began to study more of it and be glad to to show you that these two in their discussion the main point was was whether Jesus was God Almighty embodied in flesh you know one true and living God or whether or not he was another substance which if he's another substance then he would be another person so you can see the Trinity as it begins to ease in that's right the thought of substance was what they were discussing you know to whether or not that was the real substance and surprisingly I gave it to you if they want to pull it up a lot of people talking about the n and Creed any of you ever read the n in Creed brother boy read his you ever really read the n and Creek the surpris is what the n and Creed says let's just read the n and Creed now taken right out of the book I believe in one God the Father Almighty see everybody thinks a I see in Creed was a trinitarian concept right it wasn't read it this is what they came up with from 325 ad took a little while to get along a year or something but they established this called an nian Creed I believe in one God the Father Almighty maker of heaven and Earth and of all things visible and invisible in one Lord Jesus Christ the only begotten Son of God begotten of the father before all worlds God now this speaking of Jesus God of God light of light very God of very God begotten not made being of one substance with the father by whom all things were made that's nice in Creek one for who was for who who for us men and for our Salvation came down from heaven and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the Virgin Mary and was made man and was crucified also for us under Pontius pilot he suffered and was buried and the third day he rose again according to the scriptures and ascended into heaven and sits on the right hand of the father and he shall come again with glory to judge the quick and the dead whose kingdom shall have no end now watch this is where a lot of people go haywi to try to get on down to these other points under it and they really it shakes them because of what it says but listen and I believe in the Holy Ghost the Lord and Giver of Life who predes from the father and the and the son who with the father and the son together is worshiped and glorified who spoke by the prophets now watch I believe in one Holy Catholic an Apostolic church I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins and I look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come amen see now most people all they know is those words right there and they go hey where because it says Holy Catholic Catholic means Universal right it doesn't mean Catholic church right no it means Universal see so it's The Universal Church brother rold says the Catholics say they were the first church he said they're exactly right sure y but see how many of you ever even read the I see in Creed to read that it says that of begotten not made being of one substance with the father that was what they were arguing about I see I've told you this what for 40 years they were arguing over whether Jesus was God or another substance and their Creed stated he was the same substance but the the idea had already begin to impregnate to their minds and the other man or a or how you pronounce his name me they banished him from the kingdom read it all and I mean they throw him out and then they bring him back and uh Constantine finally gets baptized but there's no record he ever was a Christian that's right he's the one that set up the first night see counsel but see the argument there was whether or Not Jesus was almighty God or a light substance right which would start the idea of the trinitarian concept of God in three persons and would bring it down to the point of confusing man's mind and by 606 it had fully been developed right yeah when they came back to the I st in Council all right see we'll get back to this one later on when we cover some more Doctrine but just using it on this point of talking about whether there's two Lords or not put it on uh the other one that's on our brother Anderson s have pronounce it c e r i n t h u s sthus sthus now this is the time of John because he's down here so this is the time right after Christ remember Paul he'd already run into a lot of Heretics in his day Philipus and hus was teaching the resurrection is already passed Paul was rebuking him for it right that's why he would say there's heresies among you right look what it says about it serus distinguished between the man Jesus and the Christ yep he denied the supernatural birth of Jesus making him the son of Joseph and Mary and distinguishing him from the Christ who descended upon him at baptism right see also a doctrin ISM and left him again at his crucifixion watch but never to embody the flesh corinthus also said to have taught that Jesus will be raised from the dead at the last days when all men will rise with him now that was back in in the days of the Lord Jesus right after the early Apostles in the book of Acts right this this man was already teaching these things so when it comes down to two Lords and two gods and trinitarian isms and the one we'll get to later which is that Jesus wasn't God until the River Jordan you can see where their ideas come from it's not new it was what people that have t way on back in describing Jesus watching as a natural-born man sthus agreed with the Jewish Christian ebonites in portraying Christ as a spirit that came from Heaven undertook his Divine task in the material world and then returned he anticipates that fully developed Christian gism in later decades what John thought about him y according to irus polycarp told a story that John the Apostle now that's the writer in the book The Bible he said to have so detested Corinthian that he once fled a bath house when he found out corinthus was inside yelling let us flee lest the building fall down for cor how you pronounce it I can't get it the enemy of the truth is inside one tradition reminds that John wrote his first two Epistles to counter the man and his Doctrine we say it's not a new doctrine the Trinity concept had already crep in to the early church the trinitarian concept then developed as it was going brother Rand said from Y at n it either went into uh pism which is the teaching of trinitarianism or it went into Unitarianism Unitarianism is a basic teaching of one God bringing it down to Unitarian developing down into see these things are not new church right that's they've been taught by mankind all the way down through yeah and now the people of the message are teaching the same things that God is not one God he's at least two well is that true what do you believe well I really don't know what to believe well it's timey to start reading then get your Bible and start reading that's right I ain't got time you got time for everything else right your soul is involved in this amen that's right it ain't important who's going to be president right it's important of not whether you're born again right if you're truly born again you want to read the word and study the word that's right cu the Bible says study to show yourself and prove a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of Truth now I'm quoting scripture there but you see what man has take they've taken it and see they've made made it into a concept that the Bible is totally against and see then what they done with the Catholic church then after it did develop as a Catholic Church the Romans and the Orthodox and all this cuz it split up to different parts of that they took the Bible away from the people and allowed them to only read certain that's right text y all right that was what was getting them in trouble back there of the W Cliffs and the different ones that were back there that were trying to translate the Bible Martin Luther even got into it after his thesis writing it you know and protesting the Catholic church he began to translate the Bible himself into the German language and see all of these things started developing from the fact of what people we're teaching WR right I've read Martin Luther's own writings he didn't want to leave Catholic Church he wanted to convert the church y he wanted them to change their ways amen but they wouldn't change and once he seen that then the Lord revealed to him that just shall live by faith that's right and he started to teaching that and bringing that out to short still believing the same doctrine of the Trinity of the Catholic church because that was all that could believe in that day is all it was talked to see then you come on up to the Wesley the Methodist the Baptist the Presbyterian and on up coming into the Pentecostals OFA Street you know 1906 and you see then the oness because of zusa street was trinitarians but the one this Doctrine started about 190 1912 somewhere right in there daddy Seymour and them begin to to preach the Oneness Doctrine and it began to develop more into the truth and they begin to bring back a lot of the truth and thank God for it that's why we're not against any churches people think we are right I believe what Martin Luther they started the Lutheran Church I believe what he T her that J shall live by faith now what he taught of other things that's I might argue with him about it and not believe it but I believe that John Wesley of sanctification mhm right am John Wesley was a missionary if you remember came to America to convert the Heathen the Indians and the things and some Mor Arabians every how you pronounce it they introduced him to the message of sanctification right well when he did he went back home and he said lo I went to convert to Heathen and found out I wouldn't converted so he started the message of Methodist right you know methods of doing things that's right the Baptist came along with bringing back immersion and water M know they got where they is sprinkling everything and they started in with eternal Securities Presbyterian picked it on up into the eternal security forms predestination when as they did they brought it on out so we don't deny any church right amen we just deny the things man has taught that's right not against anybody but against the system that's caused us to do be wrong amen amen what did like one man said to me one day down there at work he said am many I talking to him about like a water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and they said show me in the Bible anybody's ever baptized any other way he said well all these people all these denominations baptized Father Son and Holy Ghost I said yeah but the Bible says Lord Jesus or Jesus Christ he said how many are out there I said well the C colone got about 50 million at that time he said you mean 50 million was wrong and you're right I said I didn't say that but I believe it amen so I didn't make the statement but I believe what you're saying is true if they don't believe the truth right amen see Jesus said You shall know the truth and they it'll set you free amen that's right but see to believe in two Lords you're going to have to come back to two Gods yep that's right right two Gods but why don't you come right down into the Simplicity of anything God created in the wound of Mary amen the egg and The Germ sperm whatever you want to call it to bring forth the Virgin birth right he was neither Jew nor Gentile right he was what the Bible said amen born this day in the city of David is a Savi which is Christ the Lord amen his name Shall be Called Emmanuel amen why didn't they name him Emmanuel go that's what he's saying right they didn't name him Emmanuel because that's what Emmanuel is Jesus is Emmanuel right God With Us right see then the one true and living God is simple to understand once we see it and why would we want to have two Lords and things about it right yeah but brother these these brothers are way older than you are and and train okay that's fine I don't I don't have no problems I hope they don't yeah I can still call them brothers that's right and fellowship with them but I just don't agree their with their Doctrine right Peter had a lot of problems with some even the apostles down through there are some of their doctor you know some of their ideas you had straighten them out all right but now the truth what how can they be two Lords that would mean two gods that would mean Jesus was God and God was God so now what you going to do with it when the word God is not even the name right amen God means object of worship right what's his name the Bible talks about his name amen you'll call his name Jesus amen Jesus is Jehovah savior you hovah SE going all the way back to Joshua coming down all the way from the beginning back there to come down to bringing to the name Jesus see because it's the only name God ever had that's right come want un quote scriptures right that's right I come in my father's name the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name mhm well then his name was Jesus y amen sure simple language simple thought how can it be two Lords if there is there two Gods any language you put it in yeah but you just don't understand I know what people say you just don't understand I agree with you I don't understand that's that's the problem I don't understand if I understood I wouldn't be saying what I said right I would be teaching what they believe right but I just can't see it amen right you say yeah but there's got to be one person of God and the other person no no you just can't see as I was say right as I said a moment ago God created an egg in a sperm placed it into a bared wound y cuz he the reason he came through he could have placed it on a rock or spoke it into existence and made a body he proved in MDC and and back there when Moses I mean Abraham seeing him right he brought a body into existence he could have done that but yet none of those were our no kinsman redeemer no that's right no so God created a body to be kin folks to human beings right amen but he just simply when that baby come forth from the womb the body was there the Soul and Spirit came into that body right simple language to me that's what happens to all babies right right amen right all babies come forth from the wound of the mother and God speaks right life into them right that's simple so that's what happened with Jesus amen but see God the Bible said God was in Christ reconciling the world and to himself y God came down and lived in the human flesh amen see they don't understand one God that's what the trouble is blood around could say Je Jehovah crying in a cradle y he said you're god with no teeth y he that's good language am little little baby L there that was almighty God right that's what the Bible say right we see we we try to make it some mystery he was born a baby he come up he growed 11 around 12 years old or something he was down in the temple teaching the high ranking official right right you got to admit he was a word because John one says he was in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God verse 14 says and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us we beheld it as the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth that's scripture amen but when that baby was born that almighty God stepped in there now here's what well how could God run the world if he's in the baby he's all he done fol could start with he ain't out there having to move every day okay tick your clock tick your clock tick your clock make it go make it go make make another day no he said it one time right let there be Seasons let there be a day that's it that's right but what what I've always loved about is you see we've always taught some form of a god somewhere you know Father Son and Holy Ghost but we could never bring it down and then you can say well now Jesus was God and they so well yeah that's right but now really you know that's what people but really wasn't God he was a Son of God a Son of God is God made make manifest in another form that's right I have two sons sitting here tonight they're they're my Sons that's me in another form you want to check it out run the DNA and find out right right righten see it's simple the Bible says by the things you see you can understand right amen but there mankind is trying to figure it out and he can't figure it out cuz it can't be figured out right it's too simple to be figured out that's right but you got to believe it amen like I was quot a while ago Jesus said unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins that's right Philip come up to him one day and said show us the father that it suffice or satisfice he said Philip have I been so long with you and you haven't seen me he said if you seen me you have seen the father why because God was dwelling there in human flesh that's right at the age of 12 he was the word straightened out those people but he straightened out his own mother too you know the story right oh it's mother come up there and she claimed him to be a virgin birth right she claimed him to become a virgin birth but when it come to that her face with all of the big religious Society of the time what she say your father and I talking about Joseph right your father and I S you diligently read your Bible what did he say must he said I must be about my father's business you know what Mary shut her mouth right right well because she she knew she was denying him as to be a virgin birth yep and she knew he was straightening her out that's right and showing who he was that's why she ow me in the Bible that he ever called her mother come on holde me a Bible right now I'm not saying when he was a little kid I'm not saying he wouldn't that he didn't run around when he a little baby I don't know who to call you I don't know what to call you no I ain't silly when he came up to the Agee of understanding right he said he called her woman y when he was hanging on the cross he spoke to John he said John Behold thy mother woman behold your son y cuz see she wasn't his mother right right she was his incubator they proven it today because they take a egg out of one person a germ out of another what you call the word sperm and they put it together in a third person and bring forth a child y That's right who does it belong to right right but you see science proves God to be true corre amen but it see you can't have the two Lord now I know what the Bible says but even I'm just honest I say now cuz I don't do off on nobody I've never heard any of the brothers that's believe in the two Lords ever use the Psalms and the the scriptures there where it says the Lord said unto my Lord right sit down on my right hand I've never heard of one of them explain that right I'm honest maybe they have maybe you have I don't know just tell me if you have let me know but I never heard a one of them say that cuz they don't know what that means that's right that's correct because the psalmist David the Bible says in the spirit said the Lord said unto my Lord sit down on my right hand till I make thine enemies thy foottoo that's right Jesus come along in in the gospels and quoting that exactly same scripture and said who son is he and none of them religious leaders had any answer no he said if David recognize him to be that said whose son is he right amen see they could they they won't take scriptures like that but what is it God condescending the Lord said unto my Lord right amen Jesus prayed to the father right that's no problem yep that's no problem with me to see that Jesus was stand and pray to his father who do you pray to right amen you got the Holy Ghost inside of you come on you got the Holy Ghost Inside you by the new birth who do you pray to i s inside you know I just real I want talk to my father no you don't do that you pray to God in heaven don't you right but Jesus one day I like what he had say about it he said father he said for the standing by I say and he stopped and he screamed like you say he was nothing but a man we'll get to that in a minute he was nothing but a man sure he was a man when he was thirsty when he was hungry when he was dying on a tree he was a man yes that's right he was a man when he was weeping because Lazarus had passed away I don't think he's weaken because Lazarus passed cuz he knew it already passed he already told the disciples days before then said Lazarus is dead go read your Bible that Lazarus is dead he was weeping because he didn't understand what he was doing right amen but he was weeping there because he was a man but what about when he straightened him shoulders up as the prophet said and said Lazarus come forth amen Lazarus walked out out of there yes sir amen he was almighty God then and see that's what man tries to do they try to make him b sometimes and God sometimes man sometimes and God sometimes now how can you do that that's a split personality if you understand it what all those other words is for and see I know what the word for what they say that that if if if he's one substance and God is another one and you know if he's one person and God is another person you know what that comes out to be a demog God there's a word called demog God look in the dictionary and you get home d e m o n g o d I guess demong God look it up it means a character or something that is of another source a split personality yes not of the right person not of the same substance so do you believe that Jesus was a demog God if he was a demog God then he needs Redemption right cuz he's another person y see that's why that's why I say then I tell you why I don't believe these things then tell you really why because if Jesus was another person he needs Redemption amen right come on and that's what we read up there that Sur in this every had his name was that's what he he said that was actually his teaching right that Jesus would finally one of these days rais so you know he didn't believe in him rais it right sure ain't that odd that some in the message we'll get to that doctrine that don't believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ big man in this message big following around the world don't believe that Jesus Christ raised from the dead right that's another Doctrine we'll get to say there a lot of them I don't agree with I tell you why I don't agree with that's right it a't don't just get up here and read them all I don't believe that to Lord I don't believe that to I don't believe that to God I don't I don't believe that I don't believe that no I try my best to explain it to where you allow something Amen to where you can hold on to a point and say well the reason I don't believe that are maybe it will expose to you what you you have believed right and we'll help you to get rid of it right 99% of what's in here tonight come from trinitarian background didn't we amen we used to believe that God in three person Blessed Trinity yeah right because all denominations teach that y other than the Oneness that goes off on the other scale of the end all right think about it then how many gods do you believe there is that's right and if you believe in a trinity the only thing that I want to ask you if anything if you believe in a trinity you believe in three Gods well then if Jesus Is My Savior then the father and the Holy Ghost don't have anything to do with me and I'm going to deny them as part of my salvation that's just plain MH see they can't be two Lords you said well you quoted the Scriptures it said the Lord said unto my Lord that's exactly right but we know how the story started in Genesis that almighty God when his word the name God wasn't even in it's not even a word it was called Elohim right that's the greatest closest thing they can get to the fact of understanding the words for God is Elohim which means self-existing so there was a time he was self-existing he didn't exist with a father he didn't exist with a son he didn't exist with you and me he didn't exist with anything he was self-existing that's right the only way we can ever have anything to do with it because we could be in him amen right by the eternal life that he had that self-existing God you've heard the prophet explain it right he stepped over into another form and said let there be amen they begin to create it was called a Son of God the theologians say it in your Bible the logos that went out of God in the beginning was called the Son of God it means speech logos speech that's what he done he spoke the word into existence by the word right and the Bible said all things were created by Jesus Christ right now Jesus the flesh wasn't back there right Jesus the flesh was not Eternal it had to be made Eternal in the resurrection Jesus the flesh had a beginning right right right but God stepped into that body it's not like the other doctrines that come along and said that that he was just a man oh Lord all these doctrines relate right straight together yep that's right and they make fun of each other and say they don't believe what the other one says that's right this people believe that Jesus was not god Till The River Jordan there when he received when the Holy Ghost came down on him on the River Jordan said this is my beloved Son in whom I pleased to dwell they believe that's when he finally become God Lord he was just a man up until then and God left a man in the garden and let him die I got a quote in here where the prophet of God says they ain't no man can die like that man died that's right no yeah that's right come on that's sensual that you seen the movie portray what is it where they beat him so much in that movie the passion passion you've seen that movie I don't believe that was even Highway enough to show how they beat him cuz the Bible say he we didn't even want to look on there right didn't want to even look on him why because he was beaten right bruised beyond recognition as a human being for my sins and yours then man would come along and try making two or three different persons if that had been almighty God how could he have stood all of that right amen he couldn't do it right there was no way he could that a man can do that let's see if I can find that it was no man you find it which one is it and I got away my notes but he was more than a man sure he cried right but in body he was a man but in Soul he was almighty God yes sir yes almighty God or else the biggest deceiver the world ever had that's right man he died to pay the price yes his blood separated blood and water he died of a heart attack amen right right no Roman spear killed him he was already dead right the nails didn't kill him he died of a broken heart amen that was why the blood in the water would separate in him and come running out when they pierced his side together am was because he died of a broken heart that's right because he was rejected a man Man of Sorrow is acquainted with grief read the psalmist sometimes until that man get so in the spirit until he'd say they pierc my hands and my feet David and all talking just like it was doing it to him but he was prophesying what it would take place amen they wagged their tongues he said not a bone was broken you go get to your Bible and read it there was a thief on each side of him they broke their legs read your Bible when they come to Jesus they found he was already dead that's they didn't break a bone in his body why cuz the Bible had already said they' not be a broken bone right sure he was a man because he was born in human flesh right that's it as a man mhm but the prophet of God said no man was like that man amen right no man can take the sins of all mankind upon himself and go to a tree no man can die for another man to do any good people to say but my God can't die but according to the Bible mine did amen if Jesus wasn't God he was the biggest deceiver the world's ever seen and I don't mind saying that that's right right he was the biggest hypocrite ever been in the world or he was almighty God Amen now which way we want to make it yes God Amen but you see it's our ideas our thoughts we get a thought not realizing that man way back down there in the time when John was walking upon the Earth which would have had to have been Somewhere In AD 50 or something cuz he put on that patmas uh in ad 93 is that right 90 90 something like that he was put on patmas I know that's when the first church age began 93 John was taken to patmas so before John was taken to patmas and come back to right Little John this man was already teaching that Jesus was just a man y then these people come along with their doctrines and they following them around the world and just shouting like one man one said about it said if brother Brandon was here tonight said be set and listening to my pastor yeah I hate been in that building yeah that's right that's all I got to say I'm not against anybody of their thoughts about it but see God was reconciling the world unto himself in that man I've preached to you to show you MDC was a man that would eat but he that man could not die for our sins why because he was just spoken into existence right right right he had to be king folks he had to become inhuman flesh he had to be according to the Book of Ruth my kinsman redeemer amen I was born according to the Book of Ruth I was born one with one more Coos or kin to me which was the devil amen you and I were born in the devil's domain you say you come here with eternal life all you want to you better realize that Jesus Christ had to die to release that life right if he had died to release that life you can't have eternal life without his death right and why did he die then if we could have eternal life without him yeah right but you see they believe that he become G that Jesus become God on the River Jordan I agree that he was anointed on the River Jordan I agree with that I've always preached it this ain't new always preached we had ministers meetings back in the early ' 80s about these things that's what I spoke then just what I'm saying now sure he was he was born a man amen but you better remember that was the body of God amen right you better believe that God created that body that it didn't come from Mary now neither did it come from Joseph right amen cuz he' been perverted just like ours amen that's right but he was born yes a man amen sure but then that man inside of that man was the Soul and Spirit of almighty God amen amen that's right living with us what are we going to see when we get to heaven if these people are right then we're not going to see Jesus and according to my Bible even when we get over in the Book of Revelations you'll find out that there won't be no City there and there won't need be no need of the light because the lamb the one that was introduced on the River on the River Jordan the lamb is the light of the city amen now we don't believe in Eternal sunship cuz there's no such thing that's a Catholic doctrine of Eternal sunship right we don't believe in Eternal sunship but there one thing for sure Sons and Daughters of a living God can be Eternal amen right y that body of Jesus was not sinful but according to the Future home of Liv it had to be redeemed right why because it had a beginning anything has a beginning got to have an ending to it amen that's sensible right amen his body was not Eternal when he was here on this Earth but it was made Eternal in the resurrection amen now you separated from his body around and said he he pour that that soul and all out of that body yep why because he just simply Ste out of it right that's it right they didn't kill him he stepped out of the body that's right they laid the body in the grave he so the BBL that went down and preached to the souls that were in prison Spirits in prison right and he came back up in the resurrection picked that body up and when mared him seen him they didn't recognize him why he was turned back to a young man right right well because he wasn't old anymore that's right amen well he was here in the world the Bible said he looked like he's 50 he looked like an old man when he was only like 33 right you see he's either G or the biggest deceiver it's ever been that's right yeah that anointing came on him on the River Jordan amen made him then the fullness of the godhead bodily right amen but it didn't make him no more God headstone supposed to unite with you one of these days isn't it does it make you any more a child of God than the new birth does no no but you see then what happens is we get our concept and our thoughts but brother we've got so many thousand quotes I told you 40 years ago about the S old Doctrine I said if you think this is deceiving cuz they only had a few quotes they couldn't line them up amen but I said one of these days they'll be quoting brother random to the letter oh yeah sure you want to contact the man up here up the road and talk to him about whether Jesus was God in the River Jordan he'll give you about 2,000 quotes go ahead BL the trinitarian concept of mankind has had so many thousands of years and is developed as a trinity you want to believe it the Bible says there just one God Amen there's one sitting on on the throne amen it would no three that come back and lived in me it's one God I know three persons Father Son and Holy Ghost came back in the person of the baptism of the Holy Ghost yes to live in each one of us by the new birth amen right my father is living inside of me right now amen because that is a new birth amen you see these doctors all tie together and they and and it shows that they don't understand the godhead that's right if they understand stood to godhead they wouldn't have the doctrine that's right amen but they won't wait for somebody to be able to put it together they just start off with their quotes and then it sounds like it's good that's wonderful but what does the Bible say Amen the Bible said he was born Lord to Christ that's right prophet of God said the anointed became Anointed with the fullness of the baptism sure on the River Jordan amen and the garden against that anointing had to leave him because he would never have been able to die with that on him I agree amen that's right it left him but it didn't leave him no less God right sir right amen the Bible said when he died he gave up the Holy Ghost he said into thy hands I Comm in my spirit see was still almighty God even the Centurion that put him on the cross said surely he was the son of God Amen MH why did they kill Jesus wasn't because of the miracle they believed in them right they wanted them they wanted to be fed they like the food he was supplying for he said you're a man making yourself God Y is that what they said about it yeah right that you're a man making yourself God we don't believe in that he said show me where I missed the scripture right sure he said because you you that know the scriptures know that you call the son of God God boy they got upset didn't they yeah amen because they couldn't stand it that's it now if Satan is the author of The Trinity and certainly is not God what is the author of these three points we've covered tying together to Two Souls cuz you got two Souls you got to have two Gods y sensible don't need no language does it got two Lords you got to have two Lords you got to have two Gods right if he went God to the River Jordan all of same Doctrine yep I'm sure I'll hear from that but you come and show me where it's not that's right amen don't Rite me a little old thing no we don't agree with you tell me why and were you don't have to quote just come on down amen I'm just honest I want to be right yes I'm not going to back up because some little cifi something you poke out of Doctrine we'll just poke out some more with you but they don't need an arguing about it that's what they was doing at NAA they were arguing whether Jesus was God or another substance another person right y another Lord or another being and not of the same substance right and even they themselves wrote the n and Creed to condemn that yeah you just read the naan Creed they condemn that Doctrine but the ideas had already been set into man's mind that's it and it didn't take long until it began to be a a great major Doctrine all right it held out pretty good I'm quoting history it held out pretty good until Constantine passed on and his son is constantinus or something close to it yeah his son took over and it held out pretty good under him but yet then when others came in then it was Hey Day from then on and you had the dark ages of the Catholic Church right for over a thousand years they ruled the world with their doctrines amen and then a denomination started coming out of that but what did they do Martin Luther come out of the saying the just shall live by faith but what did the Lutheran church do they started burning down the buildings and things that Christian people so-called so fought against the Catholic Church they were burning down the Catholic churches and Luther said I didn't teach that right what did the buildings have to do with it it was against the people not the buildings you see we think so much that we're right but where's Jesus in the whole thing where's he adding the whole point where's he lifted up exalted that's right that's right to the throne no he's demoted brother R preached a message I know one for certain say raising Jesus from history the very title see that's all I'm trying to do is raise him up from a historical God to a reality in our hearts and lives Amen to see Jesus Christ Living in me and you right yes in the new birth to bring us to be the Sons and Daughters of a living God and to one day take and change these bodies that we live in yes yep because that's another Doctrine even in this message not just organized religion organized religion always talk you going to get a new body right you show me in the Bible where you going to get one all I want is the Bible for according to my Bible Jesus raised with nail prints in his hand amen right and that's according to the Bible man amen when you either believe that or not he told him to put your hand here put it here right see it just won't tie it with the Bible he took men and they lost their lives and all the down through of the history of this Bible to bring it down to us to where we can have the understanding that's right and then we T it and tire it up and turn all the pieces with our human Concepts and ideas right well don't you think we have a right that's what Eve said in the garden Eve said I think got this thing started don't you think we need to think we need to think what the Bible says right yeah well you think you're the only one that's got the truth I didn't say that I believe around the world there are people who has the truth right sure right that's right this ain't no small following around the world they had over a million people in Africa alone that follows this message well over a million in Africa alone United States would multiply be as much as 2 or 300,000 we're not in this one little old thought right we're people that are following the end time Amen to bring it down to the truth that's right yes amen you see God made manifest Among Us amen yes Lord you understand what I'm saying see I just put them all in one L that's it there's no difference in Two Souls than there is in two Lords and there is and believeing Jesus wouldn't go out to the River Jordan they all the same Doctrine that's right identical I'll hear from that one it's all right all right but I believe it amen but like I say come and show me amen well you're just too stubborn well that's a good point I guess I am but come show me in the Bible I give you so many Quotes come give me the Bible right that's it right there I thought we were supposed to be turned back to the Bible I believe that man I thought that brother brand never come to give us a new Bible no problem right he never come to interpret this Bible right right cuz it doesn't need interpreting right he come to tell us what it said right we read it and thought there was three gods in it that's right but then when you see the truth and read it you see they can't be but one but what the Bible say right amen well I got 2,000 quotes amen bring them I'll sit down and discuss every one of them with you right but all I want to do is just give me a few minutes cuz you see I can't put nothing on Words else except my new birth right my new birth brought me to this to this God to understanding and I can't help it if he did I didn't have anything to do with it right I don't want to be hateful and arrogant and mean everybody thinks I am but I'm not I go home and cry because I want you to see the truth I want you to be led by the same God that I'm led by and he'll lead you to the truth that's what he's saying right right what was we talking about Sunday when he the Holy Ghost is come is that Bible he'll bring your remembrance whatsoever I say and even teach you things to come that's right right amen he not only told the disciples he took them deeper amen into the word that's right he not only reminded them of what he said he took them deeper and they wrote their letters from what the thoughts that he had given them right Peter saying one day he said I've been up the mountain with the Lord Jesus he was there in Matthew 17 on the Mount of transfiguration right he saw that and and heard the words but he come over there one day and he said I have a more sure word of Prophecy you know why cuz he had the new birth right that's right that same God that had said it come into it to interpret it to amen no wonder people can't understand the Bible because they don't go through the channels that it's a revealed by right that's it he said well don't you think we have a right to read amen sure I encourage you to read but don't get the and I don't mean wrong about it don't get your denominational glasses yeah right look down through the bottom of them sometime and read you might find out it says things a little different right do you see why I don't believe these things I don't believe some of the doctrines because that I cannot put it in understanding of God that's right that's right I I just can't see it I I'm just sorry come on brother let's quit you have any thoughts questions or ideas or anything comments write them down give them to me I'll do the best I can to try to to talk to you about
