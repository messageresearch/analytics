========================================

for I won't you see yes I want to see you my heart I want to see oh Jesus I want to see to see you hi [Music] we wore out your power as we see [Music] hi shoving me right your power as we see and I won't you see amen and amen and amen man good to see everybody in the house of the Lord he's not returning your scriptures turn with a beer or we've been reading in Ephesians 2 and we'll go back to the zekiel 36 to try to pick up our thought and carry it on so remember now this coming weekend this Saturday will be Bible study so we'll just come and be with us then on the Sunday the 14th brother phony will be with us to minister for us then the fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday at brother crow Shane's and so just remember each one of those and practice Lord would bless I know brother Boyd is still having problems you know there's good many sick among us so he said he sent His Word and healed us and delivered us from destruction just number of wife she went to the doctor today and said she had a real bad throat so just prep the Lord would reach down and touch that all right any other announcements we can get something okay I hope not you have any father we thank you Lord for your grace in your loving to us thank you for goddess and peace into our hearts and her lives we ask you to just be with each one Lord remember especially the sick ones among this you said you sent your word well we believe that we have the pure unadulterated Word of God laying at least within our possession to where we can call upon you and remind you of your word of what you see it we just ask you to reach down touch all of these that are sick among this we would rather Boyd or with it the kidney stone and everything and just take that away from him and Lord just have your way with us now open our eyes to that understanding forgive our sins and lead us by thy grace in Jesus name Amen visions 2 and 8 for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God and I remember it's a China travel journey that is our whole point of what we've been talking about is the journey of a Christian alright now let's go to Ezekiel 36 we started reading about verse 24 for I will take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all the country and will bring you unto your own land remember what this is this is back this is Ezekiel speaking of the coming of the Jews to the homeland all right to their their land says then when I sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols while I cleanse you so he's gonna do a great cleansing for the children of Israel now how is that to be done now he describes the way it's to be done verse 26 a new heart also when I give you and a new spirit when I put put within you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them and you shall dwell in the land that I have given you shall be my people and I will be your God you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now I'm hoping tonight that we can get to the point but I I learned a long time ago when you get in a hurry and you stumble and fall you know so we just move slow and just take our time all right yeah what have we been talking about now we've been reading this from Ezekiel about three messages talking about the plan of salvation and if that wonderful that here in the Old Testament is a a handwritten I mean writing down of exactly how the plan of salvation works then that's something that it's the plan of salvation that I'll give you a new heart I'll give you a new spirit and then I put my spirit in you now what about that to put that in the Old Testament in that form of of doing to put it in actually in just a few verses you know and actually in the New Testament all the others you don't have that much you can get my point I believe Ezekiel describes a complete plan of redemption new heart new spirit my spirit within you all right see then you don't have that in any of the other scriptures even the New Testament doesn't have enough to show you it'll talk to you about justification it'll talk about sanctification and talk about those things the baptism of the Holy Ghost well what about Ezekiel putting that to the point of expressing what would take place I'll put you in your land I'll sprinkle you with clean water which is washing of the water by the word then I'll give you a new heart promising the baptism of the Holy Ghost to the children of Israel and I'll give you a new heart he's he's describing the way to come to salvation now I want to make sure you understand one point that I've been driving heavily I've watched it and my wife and I were talking about it today I've listened three times to the past message I try to listen to make sure to try to get to a point of worth it you know that you can understand what I'm saying and then if I see if there's any statements that are made incorrect or anything I try to correct them but I want you to think about the plan of salvation okay now we are a human being which is a body spirit and soul all right it takes those three to make the human being all right now when it comes to this part here of Ezekiel I'll give you a new heart a new spirit with my spirit II don't confuse the point because when he said I'll give you a new spirit that is not talking about a new second rim of the where you would say body spirit and soul Nancy because how would he give you a new memory a new conscience a new affections and you could do on certain things but a lot of that won't work so don't get that confused just make it to be what it is all right he's describing the plan of salvation and he says now I'll give you a new heart now that doesn't mean he's gonna give you another one the word new there does not necessarily mean that because remember Jesus is the beginning of the creation of God and that's a new creation but that's not a different one he's part of this creation so just don't take it because it will say a new heart and a new spirit whatever he's gonna give me a new heart no he's not gonna take out your heart then if you translate it and can get another to understand heart and soul is the same word all right so then you don't want to say what he's gonna take my heart or take out my soul and give me another one no he's going to work on what he's got because that would not be redemption if you take away and throw it away that's not Redemption all right so if he's going to redeem you he's gonna have to start working on you from the inward part and remember that what we've brought out then salvation is not working as much in the realm of of the body and spirit it works in the soul of mankind the body and spirit are just old elements it goes with it so I didn't want you to get confused when we keep reading our saying new spirit Bertrand explains what that is I'm gonna but I thought well people don't hear a lot of times what you say so I need to emphasize that don't get tied up then to think we'll that new spirit that's a new memory new conscience new affection that's a new second realm of you know cuz your your body experience and so what you're gonna give your knees for it don't don't get tax hide that away it's not that that's not what he's talking about it's a new spirit it's exactly what he says you couldn't live with your own self and remember what the Prophet said he said he'll give you a new heart write what you sow mm-hmm that's it not another one gonna make that new he's gonna take that soul and mellow it down so do you remember so I'm trying to relate things to where you can remember your experience right do you remember when you first came to the Lord you know but I've been young might have been Oh what at that but do you remember you went to the altar with a load of sin you know ever what you went and you poured out your heart to God and asking him to forgive you to save you and you come forth with a a great feeling you you know Europe lifted and and everything will see just remember it that's not taking out your spirit as the memory reason conscience and a factions and things that's not working on that it's working on he's gonna give you a new soul not another one he's gonna clean that out you remember how we had to draw enough then we took the drawing from the future home and we wound up leaving it pure nothing in there all right that's what happens to the individual when that individual is justified and sanctified all right his soul is clean not his body not his memory his reasoning it'd be nice it would really be nice to do away with all of my memory wouldn't you there's a lot in my memory I would love to a rice you know it wouldn't bother me to go you know it's what to try to do that shock treatment you know electrical shock is they try to knock your memory jolt it out and then when it comes back you forgets a lot of well I probably pay for that if I can you I'd come out of it with better thinking but I'm still thinking the same old way I'm was and that's why brother Brandon will say he said uh it didn't take out my desire to hunt well but your father and Lin have that we drape made to drawing and it was pretty and white that's the person who has been justified and sanctified the unclean spirits gone out all right now what happens IRA you remember what I asked it I said if that's pure and clean that's you now the snake is gone that was part of your perversion sin is gone right then you come forth with a new spirit were the Prophet said he gives you a new heart I keep quoted like that because when you read the book and you get it with soul or something you said well that even what he say it see that's how carnal a lot of people are they won't listen to what you're saying then make you say what they want you to say it gives you a new soul not destroying that cleaning it up making it mellow making it repentant making it in love with God wanting to do what's right repent it sometime all right and he said then he gives you a new spirit well that's not a new memory reason consciousness no it gives you a new spirit where does he put the new spirit where the run said he puts it right in the heart you know I got one here where he said he puts that new heart right in the center of the old man so that's showing your words add to soul now and then see that huge goes right in that new soul right in your soul all right and you're still not right now you thinking it's changed your desires has changed a lot you know but it's still not complete because he said then I put my spirit in you he said now there's the Holy Spirit now here's what I was talking to my wife today but and I don't mean this to hurt feelings I mean it to try to help you to understand you know justification st. case the baptism when the Holy Ghost was the Pentecostal message come on that was might not have been exactly Azusa Street as much but by the time that come over to about 19 and 11 or in there then you started your oneness and you started your daddy C morning with the one that's coming forth and surely they would have believed in three stages of grace that's what was the Pentecostal idea well what about your prophet trying to tell him what happened and he said but yes had you missed it he said cuz most people believe when you give that new spirit they believe that's the Holy Spirit he said that's not right he said that's a new spirit he said you couldn't understand your own self it gives you a new desire a new thoughts like I said you come to the altar and you ask God to forgive you remember that you ask God to forgive you you come forth with this peace in mind and you're feeling good you're living different you act different but that can be the full new birth but also it can be that new spirit comes here regardless of whether it's two minutes or two years you're going to go through a new heart a new spirit and put God's Spirit in you or you don't have the new birth right now remember that was the Pentecostal message do you think they understood it but rather said they didn't he said especially the Pentecostal he said they think that new spirit is the Holy Spirit well what about a prophet now here's a group of people the Pentecostals with a message of three stages of grace right that's what they taught that's what they believed well here comes a prophet have you straighten that out and I'm sure there was a lot of those Pentecostal priests incorrectly we're not going off on anything I'm sure they preached it correctly some of you may be come down through there some listen in you maybe remember those days when you know that things was being taught back there but it's like I said to you before when brother Branham had those 300 Ministers they take challenge them on his doctrine of water baptism now I've asked you to go and check but I think you oughta have enough sense to know then wouldn't Baptists and Methodists now they may have been a few sprung in but then we're Pentecostal people and a lot of the Pentecostal people the black people especially of Haywood in them and already baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ before brother Branham ever come on the same especially Jesus name because they went in the water baptism unto regeneration what was the after him about why didn't they agree with him if they believed in father I mean the Lord Jesus Christ our Jesus Christ well because he was against them preaching under regeneration and they flare up about that data they were preaching regeneration that's what I mean - we think we understand the prophets message when I'm trying to make a simple illustration if you listen that there was the people with a message of three stages of grace that was the Pentecostal message right you think they understood what he tried to explain if he did why did he try to explain it right why did he tie the line why are a lot of Christian people you know can't understand anything people misunderstand and say that new spirit they could handle that new heart I remember the Baptist Church when they taught her new heart come on I remember that in the Baptist Church when they talked about a new a new heart that it doesn't mean to take your heart out put a nun in it means to mellow it down it means to change the nature of it they're making it something that's probable that can be used well surely you're Pentecostal or know God but why was that they miss that new spirit because you know yourself what they done they wanted to give the tongues and speaking the things and they didn't care what the word said right come on what about it what about it of what with is yeah what about a new heart a heart of flesh so you were received in a new spirit in that heart and then I'll put my spirit in that the new heart new spirit and my spirit three things but do we believe that and like I've told you now I'm as plain as I can be if I'm wrong you tell me I'll be glad to come back here and tell you tell who told us wrong until what you say is wrong but listen Church if we don't get this right of understanding from reading what a prophet would say how could we get it from anything else I mean we've got his very words to express I'll give you a new heart and he said he said and that's not the Holy Spirit he said you couldn't even agree with your own self well now think about the growing autumn talking about there's the heart it's clean he gives you a new spirit it's clean right because God can't give you a wrong spirit they give you a new spirit is clean all right if you don't do something about it that unclean spirit will come back and what does it come with religious demons right all right see then looking at it and seeing it in the correct way then we ought to know where we're standing he never said I'll just polish up the old spirit polish up the old heart but I'll give you a new heart and a new spirit now that sounds this exactly like it's gonna take it out put another one in I got quotes for brother Brown saying they don't give you a new heart now he gave me a brand new heart what if doctors they tell you my heart's brand-new where they gonna tell you when it quits that's silly this is what I'm trying to be I try to preach straight and try to hold it to a line but dinner I get to that point to know it and realize what with human beings think about he said you get a new spirit you quit your drinking you get a new spirits you quit you're drinking light you get a new spirit and you can do most anything with that spirit but that isn't what God's talking about a new spirit he said I'll give you know I'll give you a new heart a new spirit why he didn't have to give you a new spirit excuse me one he that he'd have to give you a new spirit to live for him well you couldn't even live with yourself how do you remember I gave you one I'll find it here in a few minutes or did it verifies what brother ran and say it he said you accepted God but said has God accepted you right on one of these quotes that's what he's describing that's why he said you can't get the Spirit of God why they've got it here someone I'm not finding in a minute but that's all he said you can't get the spirit of god in other words why if you don't get the Holy Spirit why is it that the fact if you accept him how come he don't accept you come on did the Prophet say that yes because you don't approach him correctly you approach him to the point of trying to get a new heart and then when you do you get a new spirit and oh you're happy your choice your you love in this way never and you think that's the Holy Spirit and you won't think anymore I'm trying my best this is the one gold and I've done and I wish I told my wife today what I wish I hadn't done it I wish I'd have had you to write down your experience on a piece of paper and hold it in front of you wanna preach because I'm trying my best to get you to see that you've been through a lot of these things you've been through a lot of these experiences these happenings in your life as you come to the altar you cried out before God you come to altar you weeping you get up feeling so happy so wonderful like a load of sin is gonna and you're so great and good and you start going to church and you start doing things and you become a very you know religious person well if that's the Holy Spirit as the new birth wonderful but what if it's just that new spirit well how do you know the difference each one of them is a spirit he's one of them is the spirit from God and the spirit he gives you as a new spirit is not a vulgar spirit to make you thanking acting do wrong it's a good spirit to make you think an act to do right how are you gonna tell the difference between it in the Holy Spirit the only way I can put my experience whatsoever and hold in the right way is to realize from the day God came into me and I you heard my story that's two years in this message before I'd ever say I had baptism in the Holy Ghost I didn't jump into the message and say I believe the Prophet so I know I got it brother so-and-so said I had it I didn't until it was something settled within me from that day in that altar when I raised up from there to this day there's one thing settled this is right this is God's Word and the Prophet is an explainer our diviner or whatever you gonna call it of that word so why can't we just keep reading that's what I asked you to do I said go home take your computer just running it stony heart running that new heart a new spirit you know and find out how many times brother run said this and read each one of them we shouldn't need but one but I give you at least two or three for you to understand a new heart he mellows that heart down he takes that soul of that individual it agin z' to work on it he's not working on your body he's not working on your spirit to try to get it lined up that's what we think we think well I'm doing good I got it lined up I done and run all week oh man you don't like me to quote brother branham do hear what he say brother branham do you see and he said everyday now there's that throw it off of him no i'm bragging on him cuz minds about three times a day but now listen so i give you a new heart and a new spirit then i put my spirit within you the holy spirit all right now we're to that third stage our phase of you new birth which of the phase or the part of talking about something happening now that his new that he'll put in you his spirit the Holy Spirit the Prophet said it right we read them you need them I got him lay here he gives you the new birth in the soul that don't change your body it don't change your natural human spirit of the memory reason conscience affection it begins to work upon those places and working from the inside out because what he put inside of you a mellow soul a soft mellow so he puts within that soul a new spirit then when he gives you the new birth he puts his spirit within you right that makes the new world darzee three stages same its justification sanctification baptism of the holy spirit now if you've been studying on the future home we're capable now of going into the future home to talk about this third stage the third third stage which is the baptism of the holy ghost and you know what I like about what the Bible says I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I am not worthy to borrow he said baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire and that's Scripture that was in Matthews or 1 in Luke saying basically the same wording as I'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire why does it say and with fire does that mean that there's three stages one's the baptism and then two of the two fires or something what does it mean that was what the problem was I'm gonna saying it plain language that can be that you people cuz I remember back there thinking about these things and us talking about it that a Holy Ghost and fire and I talk to Pentecostal people about that and I said what does that mean Holy Ghost and with fire well that's that's - it - baptisms young that's a baptism and then the other when you come for speed in tongues one would explain you know but what does it say it like that and now I say it this way the Bible always says what it means and means what it says no let's forget anything else well maybe they just mistranslated there well maybe we need to go to you to find out what's right and wrong about it you know you don't not be that way brother sale well if you in correcting the word I'm supposed to kiss your toe so what I've always said if you can correct brother branham pull your shoe off I'm supposed to worship the one that could do those things see I know you can't do it but I know the word is always right what is this say with the baptism of the Holy Ghost are the Holy Ghost you'll come down with fire and do what it says the baptism of the Holy Ghost and with fire I'm like this that I was talking to one man one time and I told him something but I run say it and he said I don't know where he said that or not I said I'm telling you what he said well I don't know what he said I said we'll give me counting to go look it up well he didn't won't do that he said what are you talking like I define I'm talking like this if you don't know the Bible says the baptism of the Holy Ghost and with fire we can pull it up here Joe it go that's what it does but why what and your prophet says it next comes the baptism of the fire and Holy Ghost that guard might dwell in us and the only way he can dwell in us is for something to happen after you're sanctified there was a doctor among your denomination called the entire sanctification but run said that's wrong did the message disbelief sanctification was the baptism of the Holy Ghost you could say right for the ages would they believe the baptism that wasn't enough to bring it to the complete baptism it was the work of the Holy Spirit what's your prophet said but it wasn't enough to call it the baptism but Luther I mean Wesley called it's a new birth and that's what it was you remember the other day and the messages are trying to bring Luther had three words I mean three stages Wesley had three stages Pentecostals had three stages anybody's ever born again I'm quoting your prophet they said there they have to have the three stages he said absolutely if not you're not born again now you saw what I don't blues rad code I know people are drunk and I've done myself I just had one go ahead listen what's your profit centers of the message the future home go ahead with number three I'll pick these up then secondly comes sanctification he just got through explaining yours a human heart and here's a human heart and fight and only just got to explaining that then he goes down to paragraph 91 stop it there the insecticons sanctification which sets their mind in order for holiness the thing right taken away sanctification is a compound Greek word which means cleaned and set aside for service then the next comes the baptism of the fire and the Holy Ghost that God might dwell in us listen and the fire of God cleanses our heart from sin and puts the Holy Ghost inside then you bring forth the same life that this did because that's in us now listen sanctification the unclean spirits gone out which you remember the drawing clear light you remember the message you remember what we've been talking today a new spirit all of that but why does it put there because that's you then you know what's wrong with me in you we lean to that whole spirit what you see what I'm talking about is you don't take the draw and pull it up and it's clean what happened what's that you're the same person take my case I believe I walked in a sanctified state in the Baptist Church after I found out what it really was but I know what God done so I don't worry about huh but you see I didn't receive the baptism with all ago still two years in this message all right now who was I and what was I and what kind of shape was I in to the world I was in the good shape because that's what they looked at to the church I was in I was made a deacon at 23 years old they thought the world of me that way they didn't run me out of the church I left because I knew the doctrine of that church and where I was wrong I knew when I got baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ no Baptist Church would accept that and if I left and come back I was going to be rebaptised that's the doctrine of the Baptist Church so he wouldn't that they didn't run me out I walk out of my own but what was I say the two years from the sanctification to receiving the baptism I was me I was a religious person I went to church we never had any arguments from the day my wife and I married we never had an argument over whether was going to church what was gonna do there was never a discussion we went to church we've always went in there more and you know yourself you've been around you long enough to know when we go on any work that we're not here we're in church because that's just part of me you said well I'm dead well that's all right I'm not D Christianizing you I'm just telling you what to do better okay they come out pretty good I guess but listen do you understand what I'm getting at you're standing there washed and clean you have a new spirit you love the Lord you want to do what's right but yet you don't have the new birth you don't have the death well what are you you're a religious person wonderful good person maybe all of that but that's where you can slip backwards and forward then remember that and that's where the northern ones can come in we've tried to cover all of that all right let's see if why do I have to have a fire why do I need that fire because listen you ain't gonna like it but listen because what I was was a religious person I'll talk about myself I loved the Lord I went to church that's all I ever done was just prayed and what I was welcomed all over the Baptist Association and all like that I can go and fellowship with him I tried to do what was right I didn't have to quit drinking God it didn't drink well then think you better not maybe the one fact I've tried to explain it to you I was born a poor boy I couldn't afford a liquor bottle you can take what you want to about what you're thinking that's his God's honest truth I couldn't afford to smoke and I was not gonna let that be a part of him cause in the Baptist I didn't let it be a part of me understand four years living in a place to where you couldn't light a finger on my life until I working with a lady one day and she said something and I said well that's a hot rod I said all of us have our problems she said Sam I've been here a couple of years with you and said you ain't never had a problem well that meant something to me at least I had done something to portray Christ a little bit no they understand what I'm saying from the time I was sanctified you're getting that baptism in the Holy Ghost that wasn't me I was in me with that new spirit they wanted to go to church and want to do what's right want to quit what I needed to quit and do what I needed to do how about you did you ever live in all that but you understand what was wrong I did not have eternal life in my soul I did not have that new birth that I needed so there's a lot got to be burnt out so for the next 30 minutes now remember one time we're talking about Holy Ghost and with fire has to be the fact that when you're justified that's wonderful that cleaned that sin when you're sanctified that unclean spirit goes out and you're walking in a great place of a new spirit and all kind of thing happening but you're still not eternal when the Holy Ghost came then he can't go in there why cause you still you you ain't good you're still alive you're still living and who you're living for I just had willpower you know yourself what I'm talking about most people went back into the world they come to church they've repented they go back into the world and they smoke they drank there and they never come really when they don't make no difference like I told Wade sin we don't have the messages or they don't care anyway you know well this was a Methodist preacher you know but listen there was too much of me still alive and that's what I'm asking you to go now to the message of the future home and start right back over reading where that unclean spirit goes out and it comes down I've got it right here where it comes out you know and then sanctification and then the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire because you see the Holy Ghost can't come in until everything is burnt out and therefore your fire comes in that's why it's right when it says Holy Ghost and with fire fire precedes the Holy Ghost to burn out anything that's left of you that's why most people never get to Newburgh they won't come to that place they won't die out enough to let it burn out cause they think they got it they shout their speaking does it prove or they say they cry they do it I think they've got it but listen to what he's saying go ahead paragraph 91 it was on then the next comes a baptism of the fire and Holy Ghost that God might dwell in us and the fire of God cleanses our hearts from sin well now if it cleanses our floors anything much miss what's in there that's sensible right they must mean there's something wrong no sin and puts the Holy Ghost inside not just an anointing thing and we bring forth the same life that this did all right roll it on up a little now there's sanctification the third second stage of it cleanses the mind sets or not sets the heart the mind of the heart and order of holiness you don't repent is he coming then he's baptized okay but then when he gets sanctified that cleanses that desire out of him now some people think that that sanctification is what burns you out it burns out what you don't need yeah cause this part of your life is you don't need yes I repenting it goes out at sanctification took it out yeah but it's not the burning come on I'm trying to give you see something Kagari coming into an unclean vessel if there's any sin left in our vessel God will not come in now you can claim all you want to and think you've done everything you want to but just remember that statement if that Holy Ghost comes in you were clean burn out cause watch what he's saying then he's baptized with the Holy Ghost and with fire cleanse burned out cleaned up and put you in the service of God sanctification only cleanses the vegetable okay are you isn't it let's go a little further on the future I'll go ahead to paragraph 107 you see what happened Christ came and called a church to repentance baptism in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins sanctify the church and with the fire of God come down and burn out all the filth and come and dwells in the human heart God won't come into an unclean vessel you see why brother Branham is right then if you accept him it's wonderful but if everything ain't in the right state in the place he won't accept you if he comes in he's accepted you if he don't come in he hasn't accepted you brother to hell you need to get happy about this Holy Ghost that went you shouted long enough sat down and listened I'm serious but I thought God years ago there's a brother brother Reed he called me up and he said brother Dale I said won't you do me a favor listen what is it he said I want you to go to Jamaica okay because we make plans and talk about it he said I want you to go to one is kin and preach that I got a connection with the bishop I can get you to preach he said they've had a couple of brothers come over a year to Samos you've heard this story okay just go to sleep while the others are listening as a couple of brothers had been over a year to four then and they just tore the place up because they just rip snorted what you gotta believe brother Branham was a prophet if you don't believe it you're lost in it and they really tore up instead of doing any good and he told me what they had done he said but the brother wants somebody to come and explain the message now Here I am going to oneness pentecostals that come down from Bishop Haywood and all of those the black people coming down from Azusa Street they already baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ your to hear I'm saying one God but they can do it me I'm an old Baptist that never even come through Pentecost said brother Reed oh I didn't do that he said you come on my mind to get you to come and do it will you do it I said yes sir I went over there first day we went out to eat with the the bishop I told him I said you know the reason I'm here you asked brother Reed no he's yes I said you know I'll show that the two brothers that had come over here to where everything of he said yes sir they messed up everything nobody understood what they're talking about nothing well I said I'm not here to do that I said I won't tell you one thing upfront brother Branham never done that by the way I said I'm gonna tell you how he'd do it and that's the way I'm gonna do it I said I'm going as far away your people as you want me to go from then on it's left up to you to take them on not me he said I'll tell you what you do brother Dale he said you take the morning service pour your heart out teach him whatever you want to teach them about the message he said that night you're gonna have 20 or 30 ministers sitting on the platform with you that knows nothing about the message said would you back up for that and just not hammer the message part I said that's exactly right I started out on a morning I preached an hour and a half on one God answered questions for an hour and a half went that night preached it have been there you two thought well you didn't back up too much well I I didn't back up I just didn't stomp you understand what I mean I didn't hollering screen I just started on one god I knew they could relate to that so I even told him I said hey here we you you baptized the name of Lord Jesus Christ I said them oneness in America the ones I'm associated or heard of they baptized father son Holy Ghost they don't you know necessarily do Lord Jesus Christ or Jesus only maybe in it was three women preachers sitting back there I made this statement I said we know that Eve was the first woman preacher Hey oh my god I'm laughing I never said another word they knew what I'm talking about one of them come to me out of service invited me to come preach for you you understand what I'm getting at I was not born and raised in Pentecost but I knew what brother Branham said and I knew this like Ezekiel's and things like that I knew that when I was in the Baptist Church or what that scripture meant so I just took the Bible and went through the Bible with him and they invited me back I preached six services life service ISO voice was gone I had him to put the children you've heard me to it I had him to put the children him done real good him brother Harry so that was really taking care of me it was gone ever not there's preaching to the believers on the message I was left by myself spit to renounce with a sister pastor and his wife you know great people I had them to put the kids up front and I started talking to him this talking is like just enough that I can get as your mom and dad is gonna tell you all about speaking in tongues and what you got to do I said let's just let's just talk a little bit about the Lord Jesus got through there was an altar for first time I've ever seen him buddy tried to make somebody speak in tongues cuz they took the little kids and that I didn't first hide him what are you saying I'm just saying one thing we can take the message in this be people to death with it that don't do no good but to let it be for my heart from a heart that's been through these things see I had been through the experience of justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I knew what it was and they had a guy named prophet Clark waiting them knows about and they said he had a discernment and I saw him use it three times and I saw him be right because I was standing up there looking and the three people he went to pray for was the three people that I knew God was dealing with out of 300 people herself well when he finished he swung that old hand around and wards me and I thought man he don't tell me off when he does I'm gonna get up and hug his neck he's gonna just tell them what I've been doing all this week he swung that hand around and he said in this man here he ain't told us nothing but the truth all week long oh brother Reid jumped up platform was about this high brother Reed joked up went off the platform out in midair down in the aisle running around and those people a lot of them were seeking God and I wanted to pray with him about it like I said I saw him pick out three people but the three people I see the crowd I would have went to them two three I'm just telling his honest truth but I'm trying to get one thing if you ain't got to hold a ghost in fire then you can be questioned about what it is but just remember the illustration I'm trying to give you that whiteness that thing that new spirit coming everything's working pretty good but you're still you then you ain't burned out so you need a burning out of the Holy Ghost and fire not at this two different time it's the Holy Ghost coming in and then it does it burns out anything that's left in you that is not right and brings his life right in to there to live in you I got one who get on the Statue of a perfect man that I've never seen that one what Ron said when you get born again I told you though about it that when you get born again today's a little light in your soul said it's about the size of a button and he said that just grows and grows I believe that that's the stature of a perfect man it grows and grows until it grows true listen to these others and then we'll quit 1:07 did I finish that one and with the fire of God come down and burn out all the fields and come and dwells in the human heart so just remember one time he is not going to come in to a heart that is not clean you know how you can't pay your way in work your way in and do anything you ain't gonna work he's not coming in to a place that is not burned out what I ask you have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe they remember Apollo they thought that doing pretty good they were having great things taking place Paul said have you received the gift of the Holy Ghost since you believe showing them they did not have the new birth they did not have the baptism when the Holy Ghost because he was asking them since you believed the Baptist says you get it when you believe Paul says you don't you've got to believe first and remember what I'm explaining it's got to come in clean out all the sin burn out all the desires clean everything out and come and put his own life in now there's the new birth well cuz there's the Baptist okay 110 no no but now it has to go through a baptism of fire holy fire from God which cleanses the earth I remember the earth and the person's a saint right what says for the earth for the man the earth goes through justification in the days of Luther the washing off I'm in the days of Noah washing it off sanctification was Jesus dropped his blood on it to cleanse and claim it and one of these days is gonna get a fire baptism but I love this you and I have stepped up ahead of that because we get the justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and a change of the body it's going to be a burning out but I like it now I think we ought to realize and let it burn it out of us now listen which cleanses the earth in heaven so you think the earth now listened from the days of thank the earth with air for a minute water cleansed it it didn't make it eternal it didn't make it right it just made it clean sanctification only cleansed and set aside there are the better way of saying it sanctification really Jesus when he dropped his blood on this earth claimed it the best way of saying it he claimed this earth by his own blood cause he wouldn't enough blood to cover the earth uh-huh one day it'll get a fiery baptism to precede them come in future home all right so now listen in its purchase so that the redeemed can live on it live in it in peace notice the baptism of fires to cleanse it from sin from sickness from disease germs and from sin never this must be left in there after Jesus cleanses and claims it that's in the world much less so you can see there's a lot left in me and you you understand what I'm hollering about we think we're clean and this that's being who are you might like yourself but just remember you're a sinner saved by grace don't strut too much okay from sinners from the devil and all this group now remember brother Owen says when that holy goes far over there he said it'd even burns the devil's eye right well what's gonna do it it need to burn the devil's out of me and you oh whatever I'll tell you what oh I'm gonna tell you what I'm really um I've never done nothing wrong whether they've been throwing off on me now for about three weeks he's been beating on me about all these things well get your foot out of the way I can't step on your toe if you ain't got it in the way some of you brothers in the military what did they have they had a place our that they had this machine gun that was just running straight across right and you got that on your belly and you crawled all the way through right well you know what whose fault was it is he raised up it was your foul but you wasn't gonna do that you're gonna hug the mother do you got to the other side well that's what I'm trying to do get everything I can burn out of me now then we're gonna have to get over to some more we're gonna have to get to some bases to where the Prophet was talking about do you sin he said a Christian sins daily we still got repenting to do we still gotta bring a message that Paul brought of how that that Holy Ghost will burn out all of those things but it's what is it washed by the water in the word cleanse and set aside listen he is to be cast out into the lake of fire holy fire from God comes down from God out of heaven and burns it up notice to make it ready for the God to dwell in and God in the new world that is to come is to dwell in the earth cause you say God he dwells in the human heart see you that's where you say you said but he lives in the human heart but he and the bride becomes one and they go to their home in the new world both world and the person they can live in it see the heart has to be cleanse like that now to the individual before God can come down in the person of the Holy Ghost which is Christ coming down and dwell in the human heart it's first must be repented it must be baptized in water in his name to show who it belongs to then it must be cleansed by the blood of Jesus and then the holy fire and Holy Ghost from God comes down and burns out all of the desires of sin all the nature of the world and therefore he that sins willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more okay what about it alright what about it do you understand what I'm driving in justification don't burn out the things out another's sanctification only gets rid of the snake because we're still us then we wouldn't say all we want to do on it and the devil made me do it what he brother Ron say come on what brother Ron said he said you went out to him if he does something said he didn't come in to you because it was already burnt out and clean he said you went out right come on church I hope you follow what I'm talking about because I've I've tried I I asked the Lord how do I do this how do I explain this what I do see like I tell you you say you don't believe it order to do what you want to shake it whatever call me exalted I've been preaching this for almost 50 years or so I'm not worried about I've got tapes back to 2002 so we'll go that far back and see how many times I preached on the new birth color is only like a two or three years ago we were on a whole series don't you see I believe it I've experienced it I'm trying to tell you the disciples three and a half years God let that happen to work that we could follow each of their steps instead of just said Putin there it is they had to go through all of those steps you and I have to then he lets people like me come alone the church I never did right I never did smoke I never did cuss I like my face to stay there it was the easy way to get you nose turned is to have a smart-aleck mouth I always tried to get along to everybody not compromise no no no never would they just tase it go and leave me alone now just don't fool with me I don't want to fool with you at all have you heard me tell you tonight at the Baptist Church before I've joined the church they come to me trying to get me to come to the church and get say I said listen I live a better life and you're Deacon board does I wasn't backing up they knew I knew who was doing what that's just he also told one of them one time I went to this deacon and they had told us about him and if I ever come to one of you you better believe on one time when I come get ready God we don't talk about five minutes about something I went to that Deacon one day cause he is accused of running around which is running around with somebody else got his wife indeed I said if I ever find out you're wrong I'll take you to the church I said do you understand what honey I said I meant I will physically take you to the church because I've never been one that liked to play with religious matters sometimes I said I'll take you before the church when he finally wound up getting shot but I was done gone I didn't have to put up with a note I'm just telling you Church I've always tried to live a life before Christ and before people and I know I fail every day my wife can tell you she even talked to you she knows I don't live a perfect life I have my problems I have my ups and downs but I've tried because the reason I've tried is to try to preach the word to you preach to you about justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost yeah a funny thing come on musician had a funny thing back right before coming to message and I was talking to a couple of friends of mine when I was a Methodist preacher nothing was a Baptist we just how services are at work overnight well we had like a 30-minute time we had services I've seen people pray far I've seen them healed and ever prayed for the baptisms right there just for life start up pray for the line is set there long enough for them to do it you know but listen I tried drive this to talk to them about Jesus Christ just like I'm trying to talk to you about just be sensible about your life and think about it think where you come from and what you're doing I told you the other day about it always wondered if I could take you to somebody slap my job I had a man just laugh at one day I stood there looked at him grinned back at him and he turned and walked off he knew and I knew too but I knew that thing was gone I thank God for that opportunity that that could happen to me few minutes or 30 minutes hours will he come back apart apologize listen church its Holy Ghost and fire there's anything left in us if we have the new birth you know one thing for sure it was all burnt out or he's not coming in well what's the problem with him not coming in a lot of people it's not going out and I'm saying this and the seriousness from my heart a lot of people don't know that they need to be justified and sanctified and filled with the baptism when the Holy Ghost our know what happens in each stage to be able to tell you could take somebody come up here and they'd say brother Dale I want to be prayed far for the baptism of the Holy Ghost I said okay we're pray for it but let's talk a little bit cuz most people just want to pray and get you emotionally and I'm not against that I believe in every bit of it I'm more emotional than anybody in this building and you think once a smart you just don't walk in these shoes now I love the Lord I've always just had that there's a higher to see well these are allowed that okay if I miss it I ain't worried about it he's giving me what I asked for I asked for my family and he gave me a scripture it says you will be there with your offspring you say all your kid's gonna be saved because of years know all my kids gonna be safe because God's gonna get to working on and he's gonna burden them and he's gonna drive them to their knees because that's what I'm praying for you're praying for the I'm praying for God if he has to I'm praying listen if God has to I'm praying that he turned the devil loose on this whole church if that's his only way of getting us to the right place turn it loose boy I don't like you well I think concern what do you like me I like is whether God likes us why shouldn't you have that desire is it not true that the Bible says or sign and crying for the abomination done in the city he's not that the way of knowing whether you're born again or not but how many of years ago where you don't pray for nobody and the Bible says pray for them that despitefully use you you don't pray for them that's just good to you and they give you well I'll pray for brother Larry he gave me money today boy I'm gonna pray for him Lord waiting up no no no I mean what it is that's thank on these things now we'll try to pick up Sunday Lord willing going into a few things that we've got to pick up from this point I hope you understand how we've come to the new birth and that new birth is the Lord Jesus Christ coming in living in you in the person of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that he's burned out everything or he hadn't come in kids you ought to think about it Lord is dealing with you come to the altar dr. mom and Daddy talking to them about
