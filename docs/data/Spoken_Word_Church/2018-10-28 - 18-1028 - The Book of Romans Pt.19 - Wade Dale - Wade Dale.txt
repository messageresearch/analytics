========================================

[Music] that's great that's great that's right now what I didn't say it was bad it was good but let's get in the back into the book of Romans because sometimes we get off course we need to get back before I say the truth in Christ I lie not my conscience always very witness in the Holy Ghost no this is Paul we are going to revisit this just for a moment that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart for I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh don't know what did you all of the youth who are irritated the adoption and the glory and the covenants and giving them the law in the service of God and the promises you know Virgina asked me a question this morning at the breakfast table you should one's my favorite I guess you might say no not chapter book a favorite book of the Old Testament well Isaiah would be number one and Daniel would be number two because Isaiah is a complete commentary the Bible and Daniel is the book of Revelation to the Jew so we can see there that Israel is consistent who are Israelites to entertain the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law services on the promisee if Israel would have stayed the way God wanted in the state state of course they suppose this painting they would have been his bride even Jesus when he come first coming said I don't go to Luke don't go to the Gentiles go to my people the lost sheep of the house of Israel I become the Old Testament had turned him down and we're going to read because there watch this whole summation today is going to end up right here we're brother though look as it is written behold I lay in Zion a stumbling stone a rock with fancy I believe with on them to not be ashamed they stumbled at the stumbling stone so instead of him staying here being the head of Israel he had to come down here and become the head of the Gentiles now his rule is coming in Israel is coming in not as children anymore but they are coming in as servants that's just the way it is I mean he literally lays that she can't be his bride anymore she was married to Israel if you read I believe even then I was asked somewhere in there says that I was married to thee Israel and you went whoring and I had to put you away across can't bring them back because you can't have a life that went out and had problems and you can't remarry her if she's went out to manage somebody else does the Bible tell you that well Christ can't break that law either right so he can't remarry Israel once he divorced her he's done with her but he won't forget her he said I'll never forget it so he's not gonna forget her you know he's gonna forget the ones in the Old Testament the Old Testament to me is is our foundation because remember the faith of the father's me sniffing business right the faith of the father's remember they were Jews and they everyone were born under the law the law was in the fact until Christ died actually the technically the law was in effect until the day of Pentecost and then it continued to be in effect as those that didn't believe that's what the Bible said and that's what Paul is telling us here but when the day of Pentecost come the King don't come the baptism of Holy Ghost and that brought into the many nations which Jews were taken to though 120-mm are all Jews as far as I understand they were all Jews so he the Holy Ghost fell in a Jewish dispensation first or juice my dispensation the Jewish people first that were under an Old Testament dispensation because remember until Christ died there was a Old Testament that's why the book of Matthew Mark Luke and John it's not in the New Testament that's not New Testament a great man gets it wrong but see they just think well that's Matthew then Jesus appears no he's got to die test there has to die for if he even said the testator has to die he holds up the company said this is the New Testament in my blood we haven't shed any blood yet but when he did that's when the New Testament we can sow the book of Acts is truly the first book of the New Testament right okay Matthew Mark Luke and John is a commentary about a man's life called Jesus Christ with just the son of man but it was still the Old Testament I was reading them back in the Book of Luke again because jesus heals the leper and then what's the first thing he tells them to do go to mode I'm sorry go get the priest and do the lot what Moses commanded them that if a leper was healed they had to come to the priest the priest had to check them out the priest basically the doctor right during that time here to look at the sores and the boils and all the things you read the need on the Old Testament it tells you pretty much the doctor of the whole place but he had to go show us him and do a sacrifice right because Jesus told him go do what Moses said what Moses a mode it was law okay and then Bible said to law having a shadow of things to come will we make it in there we made in Hebrews neck when maybe wrong I enjoy those chapter two books the Paul's telling us who are Israelites according to the flesh my kinsmen so Paul saying art this is my kin this is the Jews this is my kinfolk all right who are you sir lies to them pretends the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law the service of God and the promises those are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came why Christ has come in the flesh in the Old Testament Christ wasn't in the flesh oh yeah I ain't here Dean milk hasn't eaten but he didn't he wasn't Jesus Christ right okay all right but the person in the flesh that was born in one there I got that he was Christ but he wasn't the Christ that we're talking about that Paul's talking about you gotta separate the two no cuz it it was not somebody to die for you the captain of the host all those that was just God putting on skin speaking to man and then stepping back out again that that couldn't hang on the cross when that wasn't our brother he has to be our brother we went through Romans a heirs and join heirs Melchizedek was enjoin air that's my right that's my brother Ram the Prophet had to come and say okay milk as a big we see him no more now we see Jesus Christ right okay because Melchizedek wasn't our Savior you have to Savior with him then the son of God was inside that flesh body but he wasn't even the Son of Man the Son of man had to be somebody born in a wound just like me and you come forth and die for our sins and then so his life could come back inside of you so his life comes inside of you you see that's the whole key many men could die from many men many men in the Old Testament died to save other people's life made only one man but physically didn't save him spiritually but there's only one man who can die and multiply his life out like he did over there ten thoughts and that was music rocks they had the son of God inside of him the Son of God is the one that separated remember we go to that a couple of Sundays ago and even dad covered it last Sunday he died son of man he wrote son of God he had to be in son of God in the church ages to spread his gospel to spread the holy oath and then as we were talking the other day he was kicked out of the church during the church ages and here he is staying at the door who was it was a man it was the son of a moth what was kicked out the Son of God was nice thing about this yesterday listen God is so gracious because under that sound our message there can be error listen to me because fourth church age over there anyway fourth church age right here God baptized people into the body in that church age that were Trinitarian right they had come under a false baptism that had come under all this eternal hell all these things Luther was the same way but you say well what was his his deal he still was God birthed the just shall live by faith but he went dicta ignorance of man and continued on baptizing them with the Holy Ghost put them end of the body even though they had error but remember they had error they had error and I'm a point Hebrew hip Pentecost had error the 1906 Azusa Street Pentecost were Trinitarian only for 1912 the bishop Havel would reach or his even the history books tell you that that the bishop hey would come in in 1912 which was six years after the Holy Ghost fell so the Holy Ghost didn't follow a Trinitarian baptism if fellow the restoration of the gift right there I got that so you have faith for the time or a Holy Ghost for the time but now you and I have come to this age like we talked about Sunday afternoon Oh beast all day that was brother Browns message this was the son of man the head Pentecost brought people out it brought I'm saved they got him filled with the Holy Ghost even some of the great ones that Walter brother Brian Bosworth even Smith Wigglesworth around here if anybody wants to read about his his a round of this Jim it's a good book to read Smith Wigglesworth all they were Trinitarians but God went into a mess because they didn't have a message behind it meant workers work was a wonderful faith healer okay but he didn't have a brother Branham even in the 47 to 63 was doing like zerubabbel he was sweeping off the foundation and building the building was he trying to do he's trying to build it back up the manticore down right how do I tear you down crease and dogmas same way with Israel Israel toriel with Washington the pot remember Jesus Jesus even told them said you you shined the tombs and you're the ones who put them in there in other words you're a hypocrite you're setting us shining to turn them white washing it and cleaning it up but you're the one who put them in there who are Israelites the adoption and the glory the Covenant giving them long service and Jordan promises whose are the fathers and of them as concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all God blessed forever amen not as though the Word of God had taken none fact so in other words Paul's saying I've kind of give you a little glue my dad here that the Old Testament was this and God was kind of you know pushing no we're they're not all Israel which are Israel not as though the Word of God I take another fact now that means what I don't think it is what Paul is saying is he say now I'm not telling you to take the Old Testament scrolls and throw them away and burn them and don't ever read them same way with us we go man we that Old Testament you nice though there's a lot of Revelation in the Old Testament right but it's food for us revelation right I don't think Abraham lived his life on this earth realizing that one day four thousand years later they'd be a group of people sitting in here realizing we had to go the same way with him Abraham just got up and while he didn't have somebody to tell anyone today they got told he wanted so he just got up and walked and did this thing and you know and sure there was times he went there he went to Egypt there's a lot of times we go to Egypt he'd have been the world on time we travel you know the NGO de them didn't come out of agent went into career they went differently mentality journey but I don't think he just said that said well I think about 2018 there's gonna be a group people talk about me know he he probably passed on and probably figured that God did promise he gave him Isaac so I'm you know that's my promise was Isaac was my promise son so cuz you know what you take the kid up your only kid up the mountain and you get ready to kill him and and we think all that was just to act well the Bible says the angel caught his hand called it was coming down brother Brown said he would have killed that child if it hadn't been for that but Seco I knew that being the loyalty of a father though he was going to do it in the angel stopped him because of what I think was his promise see well you can't kill cumin seed and you know if having any progeny or our generation because that Isaac is dead gone laying in the grave his bodies M&E as sold in another dimension the true seed of Abraham hung on the cross and came back and had other children call me and you come remembers not seeds as of many but one seed which is Christ and that one seed is in the multiple form today neither because they are the seed of Abraham no one man not as though the Word of God had taken none thing so they are not all Israel which are Israel telling you last Sunday when we look at when we look at all these things that are going on b-bros you were talking about last week when you look at all these things that's going on and people say well you know the products falling apart no no no no no no no the bride never felt poor surprised never been in better shape no never never been in better shape than right now right it's just what you're looking at not all is rolling right that's Israel because I promise you if you if you come to this message all right I'm gonna make this strong if you come to this message and like somehow 34 years walking this message and you reject this message that's blasphemy of the Holy Ghost because you blaspheme the word that's been brought to you for that day that day an hour that you're living in I don't care who you are or what you say you are you cannot take this truth and reject it now you can surely say I don't understand it now that's okay right can they still all things I don't understand but you can't just walk up and say well everything the problem said was wrong he was wrong all this was wrong he was wrong and all we got to do get back to the Bible well I believe what he brought was the Bible we couldn't understand it without him bringing it to us right so there you go I don't care what the bread of mine I listen I literally don't care what the brother Ryan was out there when he said he was I don't care if he was on the mountain down in the valley somebody's back porch he doesn't bother me he brought me the Word of God I really don't care all these other things are superficial is human being as human thought is human ideas whether he kills a brown bear I don't care I don't people get muddled up with that Popo he's coming back well that's a bunch of lazy people think she's coming back you have to preach us something to get us in a rapture because he said right from Fred laughing two books on tape no they don't Malky when you say what someone comes to the message and gets it someone that not exactly I'm saying I'm saying you've said and been taught before even a year our six-month and you reject what you've heard and say that's not true now if you say I don't understand it and you walk away you've got a chance right but to do like they're doing they're saying this is false and we're moving over to here well my how in the world can you get how can you know what we know and now go to a Baptist Church or the Methodist Church or earth yeah and a lot of them are going out completely out in the world you see a pig's with no Facebook sitting in the bar with the beer in your hands though and they used to preach the gospel right okay that's blaspheming the holy that just that just my semesters mine it's not my opinion that's what the Bible says yeah you can't walk in this tree and then turn it away no now it's not for everybody hey man it's not right give somebody book or tape and they say look that's okay but right they're fine I don't mean to find but I mean they've not they've not turned their day of grace away but if you walk in this for the length of time that we have coming to the knowledge of the tree that is in the Bible you come to the knowledge of the truth and turn away there's no more sacrifice there's not a sacrifice for that amen so because there is a ignorant sacrifice wait you wait backstage that's when you turn this message them away by Caesar and what it is it's a demonic thing that's possessed you let's talk about that for just a second I want to make something clear me and brother were talking about this even when brother Brown says you can go totally insane take your own life and still be a born-again believer okay so you got to separate that you can't just go okay yeah you can't do that because Baptist Church will tell you if you commit suicide you're going to hell there's no there's no if ands and buts about it you commit suicide the bad news commits suicide everybody's playa they know they're teaching says this person ain't making it that's right okay but now we know and understand that there's a separation you can one of them the point I'm making is the brother Ramsay that brother man talked about they had the Holy Ghost believe it did because brother Brown called him a child of God he got a spirit on him and he started drinking and doing things of the world said I'm not preaching the morning I see he didn't turn it down and he just something got on him and said I need them do them now remember what happened he didn't go on years brother Graham said six months later he was dead why because God took him home so not Mar his name he wasn't going to let somebody do that but now you see these people that's turned this message down though they're not dying suddenly they're continuing on wow they never had nothing to begin with that's what man Jules talking about you know they never had a birth to begin with don't care if they could preach like a house on fire the wind today they never had a birth that's the whole thing they just got an anointing and that anointing I'm anointed them to preach like when we were talking about this this brother and he's never preached in this church he preached from best woman and brother Donnie and all the ones like that young guy totally turned the message down and now he's got him a Pentecostal church down in Florida and him and his wife with a passion from Co pastor and they're just absolutely just blow I mean exploding the whole place having a good time people wonder how that happens that that anointing stayed on that guy he had an anointing but he used it wrong he turned it down oh yeah but he's he's he's big in a pickle my he's peaceful but let me just say it this way he's played in the truth that's right he's played in a true so he knows how to do it and then when he come out from under the truth he still has on the morning we're not yet doing this work might be to a degree but it's mostly mostly a rock-and-roll emotion lots and you know all that stuff feeling and you'll go to feelings every time when you should never do that yeah you should never do that like they say if you want a cold chill I put some ice tender but I don't mean nothing meant neither because they are the seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called shall thy seed be called see because not only Israel Israel they will walk in a round member when Jesus was here they told him we're the seed of Abraham he said if you were the real estate lower he said if you were the real cereal don't need any help if you were the real seed of Abraham you'd know who I was hey if you were the real seat which is what what what they were looking at was they could open up a page in their in their little genealogy book and they could say so and so begat so and so and so on so but God so and so and so and so and Here I am I come straight from Abraham and Jesus said I and even polishes endless genealogies well that's what they were doing they were going and I'm sure he'd been that with priests it was like we mean wrong I was born so on so that was born coming so that was born and so on so then come straight from Isaac not all there's no there's no balls in that's why they hated him here's all kinds of one hated him really Roman didn't hating his own people hated him they're the ones who want to stone him and killing the Gentiles received his message gladly pretty much you know but when he went in him selling dogs they hated that boy all right that's why I say popularity is not a good thing in the message because usually that means you've compromised somewhere if you're very unpopular then you've probably done something right that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seed all right that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God I just explained that they could tell in their flesh where they came from I come from the seed of Joseph in addition and back and back and back and back to Abraham what was the promise the promise is what us the promises that he's going to have a seed of Abraham which is two-faced see not on the literal man seed you know gene gene terms see firm whatever go fell gotta forward see you never look at its flags that's what Steve comes from the flesh but God is the spirit they must worship in spirit and in truth they missed that point for this is the word of promise what this at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even fire father Isaac that's bringing it to here he's bringing a natural genealogy to show you as a kite that Sarah and Abraham begot a son his name was as a Isaac and Rebecca conceived and had children remember who do they have they're giving these off I mean look even you say well boy that that natural genealogy but what about Isaac and Rebekah standing there and they she had a set of twins Jacob goes this way Esau goes that leg and look what happened could Jesus come in the Bible said Jacob hello up then he saw that lady though they both come from the same woman I think brother Brown says one time come from godly parents so really so you can't count on mmm men's genealogy means nothing but now I'm telling you even when Jesus was on earth Paulo and all the ones they had to deal with that natural genealogy because that's what they lived in the Old Testament I come from this one they come from this one they came from this man you know what it had to be pure it couldn't be have any flaws in it or anything else it had to be pure liner he couldn't consulates good have been high priest all right he's interpolating here interpolating for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him the caller now what is election 92nd but you're you're correct nevermind I'm sorry I thought you did predestinate I'm thinking ahead you said for knowledge that is exactly correct because sorry I was thinking ahead alright here's yeah no one is election the action is foreknowledge it's not totally predestination good you gotta go for knowledge first that's why I was thinking somebody was a predestination so so there's God let's go make the devil bigger than going there's okay now according to the election what is the election yes removes what is an election you know God voted for you the devil voted against you so you're 101 your kind who swings the vote you either vote this way and this way is always two-to-one are bigger than one so about foreknowledge he knew what you would choose therefore he could elect you to be chosen because listen if you take the election like people preaching the message and predestination like the original that's it it's just like I told you it's this and then it it's according to your choice everything is according to your course everything [Music] but in the true God we should all be safe so there's your boat and then with the bottle said I wish did everybody be safe every person to come out of the womb beats what he wants to save them but he can't why can't he free moral agents in crime you free more languishing then comes over here on this side of that side to me that's very simple about election but then we look at election but now look we look at the story of Jacob and East on which one what do you pay if you were looking at Mary and Martha which one you picked I glanced at the other day one other looks at Jesus and says Lord let me give you an example here's a woman sitting down beside Jesus and they're conversing and here's Martha or Mary can't remember you just put the name in and here just working cleaning the wall she's fixing the meal she's that's not one Jesus thing I'm telling you though that's not what Jesus said Jesus said she chose the better thing right don't you remember she's going by she and finally I believe she just stopped and said hello I'm sweating over here you go ah yeah are you gonna help you and get up man Jesus is like she's big she picked right I'm sure she went same way with Jacob Jacob was a shyster he got that birthright by stick from his old father that was black and he deceived him and he start went out and done what he's supposed to do he was the hunter he got everything you needed to eat and all that good stuff but like I said this is Paul interpolating because remember for those of you that had been here while Paul interpolates with parentheses because Paul's writing has seeped by one even our Father in IV it was said unto her the elder shall serve the other now if you didn't have this interpolated in there you wouldn't understand what he's done you see anything in parentheses Paul is stopping and saying okay I'm making a point but and I believe the Lord put that in there Paul didn't the Lord put that in there to explain what he's fixing to talk about for the children being yet not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works Martha the hill working working working working working he saw that they were working where he working working Jacob was brother out to Jacobs hunters mom's coat though probably didn't have a callus in their life mama didn't ever think once a month my boy it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God now what's he saying as we look at these scenarios we would think God would be unrighteous because you thought we go locally so we love the boy he does everything he don't deceive his daddy he goes out and kills deer and brings in fresh meat and Jacob probably is like saying Jacob probably hiding under his mother's coattails mom was doing everything for him so is there unrighteousness with God god forbid for he saith to Moses I will have mercy on whom I have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so there is not of him that will it nor of him that runneth but of God that short mercy because he knew Jacobs heart he knew Jacob wanted that birthright and he knew in E soft heart he never would want the perfect didn't mean nothing to him okay for the scripture saith unto Pharaoh even for this same purpose have I raised the other that I might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth remember God hardened Pharaoh's heart several several several times in the Old Testament now listen to make election in foreknowledge stand god didn't walk in and go feral don't you let the people go he just gave him a scenario and Pharaoh chose which one to take okay it wasn't it it wasn't it God come in and he said now Pharaoh you don't need doing that huh don't you do something else knowing that he can't do that therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardeneth because he knows your choice like that to help me more than anything okay you take people like Adolf Hitler and all these different one and even when we look now come to this folks and this is what's gonna really this is what will stump you come up to the end time and the beast and the false prophet goes into the way fire before there does before Judgment Day why kind of knows I'll never move men okay no don't ever repent then we're going to the lake fire before the day of judgment the Bible tells us that in Revelation def thrown into the lake of fire before the watch come good what really you know what a wife nor judgment is and for you to judge yourself they're judging themself Jesus Christ is going hey you turn me down and they said yes with it so who's judging there we good now these that have left the message and think they're still in the Bible to me they're the ones they come up to that day and say have I not cast out Devils have I not prophesied have I not done this have I not done that and you'll say depart from me I never knew you and that word new in that it's just like Adam knew his wife he was an intimate not a sexual relationship but an intimate relationship he said I never knew you that's the same news when Adam knew his wife Eve so it's an instant hit yes when he told them he said you've got all this but you never had an intimate well what does an intimate relationship with God if the Holy Ghost you have an intimate relationship we go right rough nothing now we'll say then unto me why doth he yet find fault for who has resisted his will what nay but o man who art thou that repliest against none shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why hast thou formed or made me thus people take that wrong that tells me that when those people go to the white throne judgment they're not going to ask him - why'd you make me wrong they know why they were wrong they did the wrong God didn't make him do wrong if he made him do wrong he's dying - giving me eternal life and he's because he wouldn't be just a factor he's got to be a just God and I just die means just this that's where the word justice come from judge justice okay what a half's now made me this hath not the Potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel honour and another unto dishonour God knowing our choice that's what I said about Adolf Hitler hidden God through his foreknowledge knew if he gave Adolf Hitler a million years to repent he said I you can live a million years I tell Hitler and he can't force him to do it he'd never repent that's right he knew that so about foreknowledge we knew that so by foreknowledge he knew the beast and the false prophet and yeah that foreknowledge he knows that the people would want on Kobol what they're gonna do but there's gonna be some surprises that twice come judgment he's going to give eternal life to somebody that don't even want it that's been good to you drown I believe that 100% what if what if God come up willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much long-suffering the vessels of Wrath fitted for destruction that's what I'm just telling you what if God willing to show his wrath to make his power known endured with much long-suffering the vessels of Wrath fitted for destruction now he knew before Adolf Hitler was born what he was gonna do so why he just killed him as a baby you can't give them any baby I'd give him with joy life say okay do you kill him as a baby you know if everyone who went to heaven right Oh baby's gonna have so he lay upon does he knew you had come to a place and then somewhere the active term gone down Lord we don't ever go that's to me that was the most easiest thing a man to do him and that doctor his mingling recently but all that was was in same demons that was that was back in the Old Testament persecuting Israel they just came into the into the 1940s and then that demons not dead it's going to go over into the two witnesses and Israel they're gonna kill them so you know they that we got to kill all the Jews think yeah and then he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he had the for preparing the glory the irrelevant preach on the law contrast you got to have something bad to have something good but that's what this is here he had to have something by had to let something allow something to be bad so that he can take the good out of it I desire to be yes exactly just like the Garden of Eden he took something beautiful allow Satan to come in but he allowed it to make a choice and listen we be for Eve to death I don't maybe I don't want to sold us out evening right I don't want it sold us out all right but being that they were one you couldn't kill one yeah all right and then he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy us which he had a for foreknowledge prepared unto glory even us whom he have called none of the Jews only but also of the Gentiles he's asking the question and he said also in OCR that would be let's look at that would be what the book of pulls that hold that so he's quoting scripture right when a book of Hosea I will call them my people which were not my people jinn health and her beloved which was not beloved the Gentiles this is talk about the Gentiles coming in God loved Israel he still does love Israel but he had to put her away when she went with another man another doctor in another you know doctrine of balaam and all that he had to put her away to the king take her back and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them ye are not my people there shall they be called the children of the Living God because remember he told them he said don't go to don't go to Gentile he came to his own and his own received him not he came to a Jewish place and they turned him down Esau also cried concerning Israel though the number of the children of Israel has beat the sands of the sea a remnant shall be saved for he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because the short work was the Lord mate on the earth as and as Esau stood before except the lord of sabbath had left us a seed we had bad stardom the benz Gomorrah well that's not he saw that's out there sorry yep story its Isaiah Isaiah said so this is quoting isaiah i said the lord of sabbath had left us a seed we've been inside of them been gamar what shall we say then that the Gentiles which followed not after righteousness have obtained to righteousness even the righteousness which is of faith comes remember Israel was not so much a faith nation they needed signs and wonders Jarius come and touch my daughter coming but what did he see when he saw the centurion which was a Gentile said Lord no you don't even have to come how few to speak for you have authority to speak the word he said I'm not seeing any faith in Israel like this why because
