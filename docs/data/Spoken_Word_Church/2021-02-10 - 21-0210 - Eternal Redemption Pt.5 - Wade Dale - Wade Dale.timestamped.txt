[10:45] good to be in the house with the lord
[10:46] good to be here on wednesday night good
[10:48] to see all you smiling faces
[10:50] pray for brother louise he got he didn't
[10:52] get caught in an accident
[10:54] he got caught in an accident
[10:58] there was an accident and he got caught
[10:59] behind it so they couldn't move they've
[11:01] been sitting there for an
[11:02] hour or so so i think they they turned
[11:04] around and went back home so they're
[11:05] watching in
[11:06] so um
[11:10] no i don't think i'm going to use it
[11:11] tonight i think we're we're just going
[11:12] to review a little bit though
[11:14] and but i think that you got it in your
[11:17] in your mind what we're trying to
[11:19] um whether you believe it or not it's
[11:21] sure it's left up to you
[11:24] but uh i just i just feel that
[11:28] we're coming to a time that um
[11:32] all those years that brother dale and
[11:34] all the different ministers
[11:36] kind of fought through the bushes you
[11:38] know
[11:40] now we should have a pretty clear path
[11:41] to get to where we're going
[11:43] hey man it's a lot better
[11:47] to have a road cleared out for you
[11:48] before you get started
[11:50] you can make it down a four-lane highway
[11:52] really good but when it narrows down to
[11:54] a two-lane and then when it gets down
[11:56] to a one lane and then when it gets down
[11:57] to a dirt road
[11:59] and you gotta get out and pick up sticks
[12:01] to get them out of the road you should
[12:02] understand what i mean that's how they
[12:03] started with with all people throwing
[12:05] sticks and rocks in the road you know
[12:06] but now i think we're on a four-lane
[12:08] highway i i think that that it's time
[12:11] that
[12:12] we don't have we're not looking for
[12:13] another profit we're not looking for
[12:15] another message
[12:16] we're just looking to get out of here
[12:18] we're looking that we're looking at a
[12:20] time that um
[12:21] you know we get up every morning with
[12:23] something new something's going on here
[12:25] or something's going on there or
[12:27] something
[12:27] pops up here or something pops up there
[12:29] but the eternal word of god never
[12:32] changes
[12:34] and as i said many times before we are
[12:36] going to make it
[12:38] we may be brother brown said we will be
[12:40] battle scarred veterans we will not be
[12:42] sitting up there
[12:44] with uh um we gonna have i got out in
[12:47] the garden for the first time today
[12:50] and i got a blister so that's the way it
[12:53] is with the gospel we're gonna have
[12:55] blistered hands and and uh but we'll be
[12:58] sitting there across the table and
[13:00] somebody look over and say how in the
[13:02] world did you make it
[13:03] through the worst darkest age even
[13:06] though we've got the most
[13:08] intelligence we've got tv we've got
[13:11] um you know we can carry the message in
[13:13] our pocket what
[13:14] you know john wesley and all those they
[13:16] would love to have all their
[13:17] head have had all their messages in a
[13:20] little cassette
[13:21] player or something they could put in
[13:22] their pocket and review with their
[13:24] because you know what
[13:25] john wesley would would preach a sermon
[13:28] and then he would go somewhere else
[13:29] there was no recording of that it had to
[13:31] be by the spoken word somebody had to
[13:33] relay it
[13:34] to someone else so me and you we can get
[13:37] a question in
[13:38] in the word of god we can number one
[13:40] turn to the word of god
[13:42] then number two we can you know go to
[13:44] the
[13:45] um table
[13:49] or folio views and there's the message
[13:51] and there's the quote and there's the
[13:52] you know
[13:53] so we shouldn't be um
[13:56] we shouldn't be where we say i don't
[13:57] know anymore
[13:59] we should be that we know that we know
[14:01] that we know amen

[14:45] everywhere well the ladybugs don't come
[14:47] out when it's cold

[14:51] welcome to georgia weather if you don't
[14:52] like it wait 15 minutes it'll change
[14:55] right so thank god we're going to a
[14:58] place
[14:59] that we don't need a thermometer we
[15:01] don't need a thermostat
[15:04] amen it's all going to be exactly the
[15:06] way you want it
[15:07] and the way i want it so it's already
[15:09] been prepared before the foundation of
[15:11] the world so if you've
[15:12] got your bibles turn to the book of
[15:14] hebrews
[15:15] nine we'll continue we're just going to
[15:19] review today we brought a few more
[15:21] quotes
[15:22] on eternal redemption and i hope that
[15:26] i hope that you're listening anyway
[15:28] because to get this
[15:29] to get anything going right what's the
[15:31] first thing you got to have a good
[15:32] foundation
[15:33] gotta have a good foundation to go from
[15:36] adam to the future home you've got to
[15:38] know
[15:39] where adam is you got to know where you
[15:41] are you got to know where moses was you
[15:43] got to know where all these different
[15:44] players in this great plan of god
[15:48] you know god just laid it out here in
[15:50] the bible for us
[15:52] but man has so um watered it down
[15:55] and moved it around and that's why god
[15:58] had to send a prophet
[15:59] so that when we can read malachi 4 luke
[16:02] 17
[16:03] 30 we know that's for us we know that
[16:04] was the end time people
[16:06] and that matthew 28 19 doesn't
[16:08] contradict acts 2 38.
[16:10] amen so we know that and we
[16:14] you know i just rest my soul on that
[16:16] right i rest my soul on this message
[16:18] being right
[16:19] and and i just can't rest it on nothing
[16:21] else
[16:22] um i'm not looking for anything else so
[16:25] if you're not looking for anything else
[16:26] tonight
[16:27] then let's hone in on what we got amen
[16:30] take what we got prophet god said in in
[16:33] these
[16:33] tapes lies rapture in faith he didn't
[16:36] say own them
[16:37] he said in them in these tapes lies
[16:40] rapture and faith not just quotes
[16:42] because like i said quotes will kill you
[16:45] but not when it becomes life
[16:48] when it becomes live now i tell you
[16:49] though when it becomes live it's going
[16:51] to be like jesus we'll talk a little
[16:52] about that maybe later on
[16:53] when jesus became the word made flesh
[16:55] they called him a devil
[16:57] right so when you take what's on this
[17:00] paper
[17:01] and you walk it and live it people are
[17:04] gonna hate you
[17:06] because they're not gonna they're gonna
[17:07] say well why are you doing this and why
[17:08] are you doing that well it's because
[17:10] the word of god's inside of me i'm i'm
[17:12] trying to become the word of god
[17:15] amen being a son and daughter of god so
[17:17] hebrews 9
[17:19] verse 11 and 12 let's go to the lord in
[17:22] prayer dear heavenly father thank you
[17:23] today
[17:24] in the middle of the week that we have a
[17:26] little time set aside lord that we can
[17:27] worship
[17:28] in spirit and truth we pray now that you
[17:30] would come and be the active participant
[17:32] in this service
[17:34] you do the speaking lord and you also do
[17:36] the hearing as far as
[17:38] the people sitting in their seats lord
[17:40] they they do not know what i'm going to
[17:42] say next but lord you do
[17:44] and maybe lord you can give them a
[17:45] little spark
[17:47] into their that theophany that we're
[17:49] talking about that come from you lord
[17:51] then
[17:51] as the prophet said the word meant the
[17:53] word so we want to do that tonight let
[17:55] the word meet the word father
[17:57] and when we do that then there's nothing
[17:59] satan can do about it
[18:01] he hates the word but when the word
[18:02] meets the word
[18:04] the prophet of god even says when two
[18:05] omnipotents meet
[18:08] something has to happen so we pray lord
[18:10] we all have needs in this church right
[18:12] now lord physical needs spiritual needs
[18:14] our children need have needs our
[18:17] grandchildren have needs we have
[18:18] children that are lost we have
[18:20] all the different things lord we pray
[18:22] that you just during this time of this
[18:25] um from now till the end whenever you
[18:27] come lord that you'll just work in their
[18:29] life
[18:30] lord just don't let them sleep until
[18:33] they find you lord
[18:35] we pray that you would just be with each
[18:36] one now bless us in jesus name
[18:39] amen what a wonderful thing if we had
[18:41] everybody here
[18:42] all you kids didn't have to worry where
[18:44] they were had all your grandkids didn't
[18:45] have to worry where they were
[18:48] you just keep claiming them because you
[18:49] know what if you don't claim them
[18:53] how they gonna come you gotta keep
[18:56] claiming them you gotta keep claiming
[18:57] them keep claiming them put the token
[18:59] over them
[19:00] right you know ask ask some of these
[19:03] that have come back to the lord you
[19:04] place the plate
[19:05] place the token over them and they're
[19:07] like
[19:08] joshua's like leave me alone
[19:11] you know i mean you get caught at every
[19:12] turn and every
[19:14] not me i can't be with you all the time
[19:17] but you know i know somebody that can't
[19:19] right right bro zack
[19:24] but christ being coming high priest of
[19:26] good things to come by a greater and
[19:27] more perfect tabernacle not made with
[19:29] hands that is to say not of this
[19:30] building
[19:31] so in other words we know that the old
[19:33] testament was a
[19:35] type and i've been reading in leviticus
[19:38] for my morning devotion and and man i
[19:41] tell you
[19:43] they had to give everything exactly
[19:45] right
[19:48] everything had to be done in order aaron
[19:50] had to do things in order the priest had
[19:52] to do things in order the sons had to do
[19:54] things in order
[19:55] they had to separate um all the
[19:58] different parts of the animal it wasn't
[19:59] like they just threw the thing on there
[20:00] and then walked out the door no it was a
[20:02] job i'll bet you when those people were
[20:04] done
[20:06] they were tired but see they didn't have
[20:08] to minister like we brother brown says
[20:10] you know a preacher preaches a sermon
[20:12] it's like working eight hours a day
[20:15] right it is it's toiling and struggling
[20:18] and all the times that we
[20:19] to get the sermon and bring it in but
[20:21] the priest all they had to do
[20:22] was they didn't have to preach a sermon
[20:24] they would just but boy look at the
[20:26] physical work they had to do but anyway
[20:28] i just want just if you'll read those
[20:29] through you'll think man
[20:30] it's not as easy as you think just throw
[20:32] an animal up on there no they have to
[20:34] take the breast and the neck and to this
[20:36] and
[20:36] that because you know why the word of
[20:39] god told them to do it
[20:41] so how are you and i gonna get by that
[20:42] was my whole thought how are you and i
[20:43] gonna get by
[20:44] doing part of what the word says can't
[20:46] do that amen
[20:47] neither by the blood of goats and cows
[20:49] but by his own blood he entered in once
[20:51] into the holy place
[20:52] having obtained eternal redemption for
[20:56] us you may be seated in the lord at his
[20:57] blessing
[20:58] to the reading of word and we're gonna
[21:00] just run through these real quick
[21:02] these quotes that we've been reading i
[21:04] like to read them anyway because
[21:07] it's the word of god phoenix arizona
[21:10] 1955 brother brown said job the oldest
[21:12] book in the bible
[21:15] was supposed to be even written before
[21:16] moses wrote genesis but the oldest book
[21:18] in the bible was speaking of redemption
[21:20] yet redemption was way before that
[21:23] redemption is one of the oldest things
[21:25] in the bible
[21:26] did you know redemption was even before
[21:28] the plan of redemption was laid out
[21:30] before the world was ever formed
[21:32] think of that god foreseeing there's
[21:33] that four knowledge we were talking
[21:35] about sunday
[21:36] and making a way of redemption before he
[21:38] even made the world
[21:40] because he knew we were going to fall he
[21:42] could by foreknowledge know what we were
[21:44] going to do
[21:45] so he had it laying right there for adam
[21:47] and eve but it wasn't adam and eve
[21:48] pulling them through a tube
[21:50] it was adam and eve with a tree of life
[21:52] and a tree of knowledge of good and evil
[21:54] they had a choice to make from the
[21:57] get-go they
[21:58] had a choice to make even cain cain had
[22:00] a choice to make
[22:01] even when he killed abel god said if
[22:03] you'll do this you'll be fine
[22:05] if you don't do this if you do this or
[22:07] don't do that sin lies at your door
[22:09] so the plan of redemption had to be laid
[22:12] out before the foundation of the world
[22:14] because god knew we were going to mess
[22:15] up
[22:16] immediately amen he knew that
[22:19] but that's okay because that started the
[22:22] plan
[22:23] of redemption i was thinking today you
[22:25] look at that plan of redemption
[22:27] you know he laid the thing out just like
[22:29] you and i would lay a plan out even
[22:30] though
[22:31] we sometimes lay a plan out and change
[22:34] it god can't change his
[22:35] but he's still in his mind he laid out a
[22:38] plan
[22:40] and that plan to me was written in 66
[22:43] books of the bible
[22:46] pretty simple but very profound because
[22:49] they still take this 66 books of the
[22:51] bible and preach all kind of doctrines
[22:53] out of it so you got to get the love
[22:54] letter
[22:55] that's why we needed a prophet coming
[22:56] the end time to give us
[22:58] eliezer to give us the love letter
[23:00] between us and christ
[23:03] amen yes praise god for that right
[23:05] brother
[23:06] titus let's read verse 2 and hope of
[23:10] eternal life which god that cannot lie
[23:12] promise before the world began i want to
[23:14] ask you a question on that one who did
[23:16] he promise it to
[23:20] there was nobody there
[23:27] he promised his self and we were inside
[23:31] of him when he promised him
[23:33] i'm going to have children i am going to
[23:35] have a world
[23:36] i am going to have people that will
[23:39] worship me i'm going to have
[23:41] this and that and the others see
[23:43] promised before the world began but hath
[23:46] in due times
[23:47] manifest his word through what preaching
[23:50] which is committed unto me according to
[23:51] the commandment of god our savior which
[23:52] i was talking
[23:54] about the apostle paul so let's go to
[23:56] ephesians one let's just go ahead and
[23:57] get some of these
[23:59] out of the way and then we won't bring
[24:01] the chart out tonight but we're just
[24:02] going to recap
[24:05] let's go to verse 4 save time
[24:08] according as he has chosen us in him
[24:10] remember
[24:11] he chose us in him we you say no now you
[24:15] said you don't have a choice
[24:16] you don't have a choice when it comes to
[24:18] that
[24:21] but the reason he chose us in him was as
[24:23] he saw you choose him down here
[24:25] right now amen is that all right
[24:29] we're chosen in him by foreknowledge
[24:33] not by just remember he can't he didn't
[24:35] shoot chose
[24:37] donny and not choose daddy
[24:40] but he knew by foreknowledge that he
[24:42] could put it in
[24:44] a place where donnie could get it and
[24:46] even put it in the place where this one
[24:47] could get it and he didn't want it
[24:51] that's why brother brown said
[24:52] predestination is hard because
[24:53] predestination is just like walking down
[24:55] that aisle it's just predetermined
[24:58] and being predetermined god could write
[25:00] the bible
[25:01] before the foundation of the world but
[25:04] he didn't write the bible
[25:06] making people do what they do
[25:10] i mean he hardened the heart of pharaoh
[25:12] i was reading them the other day you
[25:13] know where he hardened
[25:14] pharaoh's heart but he told moses he
[25:16] said i'm gonna harden his heart
[25:18] but now still pharaoh had a choice
[25:22] god didn't come down and say no you
[25:23] don't let them people go
[25:25] no he just put it before pharaoh knowing
[25:27] what pharaoh would choose you've got to
[25:29] remember one thing god
[25:30] cannot make you do something
[25:36] if you don't want to do it
[25:41] even though being god but you know what
[25:43] though remember
[25:44] he foresaw that foresaw what you would
[25:48] do
[25:48] and that you would come to a place maybe
[25:50] that you said i don't care anything
[25:52] about this i'm going in this direction
[25:53] and nothing's going to bother me
[25:55] well it's like that's like you know we
[25:57] were talking about the chart they then
[25:58] there was no representation
[26:00] oh they had representation all right but
[26:02] it was not representation from the
[26:03] eternal
[26:05] it was representation just in life
[26:08] because well look when we drop down
[26:10] and come down to the to the uh lifetime
[26:13] and matter
[26:14] or light timing matter we're gonna see
[26:17] that all that comes down
[26:20] but then all of a sudden you see nimrod
[26:23] and all these different other players
[26:25] come into
[26:26] being that were not in the eternal mind
[26:28] of god but he knew what they were going
[26:30] to do
[26:31] knew where they were going to be knew
[26:33] what they were going to do
[26:34] and then he could work his plan this to
[26:37] me
[26:38] that's just the most perfect way to do
[26:39] it but according he has chosen us in him
[26:43] before the foundation of the world that
[26:44] we should be holy and without blame
[26:46] before him in love
[26:47] that's what i asked somebody one time
[26:48] before i said look it says
[26:50] it's already now look it's predetermined
[26:55] that we're going to be holy and without
[26:58] blame
[26:59] now as you and i are sitting here today
[27:04] we are not we are by the new birth
[27:08] but not by our old birth
[27:12] so he's already predetermined
[27:16] by foreign knowledge who's going to keep
[27:18] going on and who's not because those who
[27:19] is justified he's already glorified by
[27:21] what
[27:22] not by foreign knowledge i mean not by
[27:23] predestination but by four knowledge
[27:27] so see you determine as brother tom paul
[27:31] bush always said you trigger your
[27:32] predestination in other words
[27:34] you have everything in the world to do
[27:36] with it it's not putting in a tube well
[27:38] this is just the way i am
[27:41] it is what it is oh who says that
[27:45] anyway that we should be holy and
[27:48] without blame before him in love having
[27:50] predestinated us until the adoption
[27:52] so he has predestinated us to come to a
[27:54] position
[27:56] by jesus christ to himself according to
[27:58] the good pleasure of his will
[28:00] now remember you say well now he's he's
[28:02] always sure he's going to have a perfect
[28:04] well but remember we're working in
[28:05] permissive will right now
[28:06] but he takes permissive will and works
[28:08] it right back to his perfect will
[28:10] but now remember the bible also tells us
[28:12] that god's willing everybody would be
[28:14] saved but not everybody's going to be
[28:15] saved
[28:16] because of the choice of foreknowledge
[28:22] he can tell who will and who won't to me
[28:24] that's just so very simple
[28:26] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[28:29] wherein he hath made us what
[28:31] accepted in the beloved now see that's
[28:34] that's why brother brown said he really
[28:35] liked this scripture
[28:36] because what he'd done is taking us to a
[28:38] higher plane
[28:39] only in the book of ephesus could he do
[28:41] this only to the ephesians could he talk
[28:44] this way
[28:45] because they were a little more learned
[28:49] that we could all he could already tell
[28:50] them that we have already been accepted
[28:52] into beloved in whom we have redemption
[28:55] through his blood the forgiveness of
[28:56] sins according to the riches of his
[28:58] grace
[28:59] wherein he has abounded toward us and
[29:01] all wisdom and prudence
[29:03] having made known unto us the mystery of
[29:05] his will now remember
[29:06] paul got a part of it but he didn't get
[29:08] all of it
[29:10] remember the book was still closed the
[29:11] seals had not been opened
[29:13] he was working under a closed book he
[29:16] could take you i believe paul could take
[29:18] you just as close as
[29:19] as anything to that but he was not
[29:23] able to open the seals because that was
[29:27] predestinated to happen in the end time
[29:30] because you and i needed a body change
[29:32] paul did not need a body change you and
[29:33] i need a body change because there's no
[29:35] eighth church age there's no
[29:37] there's nothing we can throw this to you
[29:39] and i oh this is it we're either going
[29:41] to make it
[29:41] or not but we're going to because he saw
[29:44] somebody would make it
[29:46] that was a mouthful
[29:49] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[29:51] of times what right now this is the
[29:53] fullness of time
[29:54] i want you to understand that this is
[29:56] where god wants to work
[29:59] you say all this circumstances
[30:02] forget about circumstances
[30:10] remember we talked about the kuckelberg
[30:12] you're going to be sticky in this right
[30:14] here
[30:15] you're going to be sticky in your
[30:16] memories and conscious effects and
[30:18] imagination because
[30:19] that is what's killing us today is our
[30:21] memory
[30:22] our reasoning our conscience our
[30:24] affection
[30:25] and our imagination but now way down
[30:29] on the inside though when that cuckoo
[30:30] burr
[30:32] was changed into a wheat germ when that
[30:34] wheat life was put inside that
[30:35] kuckleberg
[30:36] we're supposed to bring forth wheat
[30:39] look like kookaburra all our life
[30:43] think about that 90 year old woman that
[30:44] brother brown saw
[30:46] when they went across the curtain of
[30:48] time we'll talk about that in the sixth
[30:49] dimension
[30:50] he went over there and that angel said
[30:51] hey you remember her
[30:53] well no he didn't remember because she
[30:56] was 90 years old when she came to the
[30:58] lord
[30:59] well she was a huckleberry for 90
[31:01] something years
[31:02] but you know what she accepted christ
[31:05] and became a wheat
[31:07] and he saw that wheat in that sixth
[31:09] dimension
[31:10] he didn't see the woman he didn't see
[31:12] the woman he saw in that in this
[31:14] dimension
[31:15] he didn't see the woman that was birthed
[31:16] by her mama and daddy
[31:18] a long time ago he saw the new creature
[31:21] the new creation the new part of her
[31:24] that what when the cuckoo bird broke
[31:26] loose guess what happened there was
[31:27] wheat
[31:28] amen same way with you and i so
[31:32] let's don't worry about being the old
[31:33] huckleberry that's why paul says let's
[31:35] go on to perfection
[31:36] not laying again the foundation of all
[31:38] these different things let's go on
[31:40] to perfection our problem is we're like
[31:44] the frog
[31:47] we keep looking back
[31:51] what gets me is you look at the world
[31:53] and it's a little bit funny but
[31:56] mom can tell you you open up the paper
[31:59] and you look at these people that have
[32:00] passed on
[32:02] and you look and you say man that girl
[32:04] she was young
[32:06] well she was 88 when she died but that
[32:08] picture was her high school picture
[32:10] why do they do that let's look him back
[32:13] everybody wants to look back to what
[32:15] they were forget that business
[32:19] we supposed to look forward go on
[32:22] we got to worry about today stop back
[32:26] looking back that way it really tickles
[32:28] you know you look at him you go what
[32:30] that girl died
[32:31] really young she was 88 when she passed
[32:34] away but it's her high school
[32:36] picture so but why why do that to me
[32:39] that's false that's just the whole world
[32:41] is
[32:42] they were talking about today at work
[32:43] and about putting on makeup and how it
[32:46] was so hard and how it was
[32:47] they had to get up 30 minutes early and
[32:50] oh i'd be a wreck and i'd
[32:51] try to put it on going down that to me
[32:53] that's a lot of trouble
[32:55] i'm glad y'all don't have to do that
[32:59] i'd hate to see some of these women
[33:00] without the makeup on
[33:02] uh-uh
[33:06] brother brown said look like i ain't not
[33:08] a saint
[33:10] but see be natural be yourself i don't
[33:12] know where that came from but
[33:14] let's do that because we're getting
[33:16] ready to get out of here and everything
[33:18] every piece has got to fit together
[33:21] he might together gather that's what i
[33:22] was talking about in leviticus read
[33:24] leviticus and just read the whole
[33:26] leviticus one through about 20-something
[33:29] it's
[33:29] it's just everything is so perfect
[33:32] everything's got to be overlaid with
[33:33] gold and this has got to go first and
[33:35] that's going to go this and this got to
[33:36] go that and this goes this way
[33:38] but see that's the same way but that's a
[33:39] precursor to the word of god coming
[33:41] through jesus christ
[33:42] telling us be therefore perfect you
[33:44] don't have to do that anymore
[33:46] but you've got to do the things you're
[33:48] supposed to do written in the bible
[33:50] look at him a four-hour example that
[33:54] into this
[33:54] dispensation the fullness of times he
[33:56] might gather together in one
[33:58] all things in christ and i'm going to
[34:00] read a quote here in a little while that
[34:01] i have not read before
[34:03] and brother brown says tells us that all
[34:06] things are now where
[34:08] in the bride we gathered everything in
[34:11] christ and now we know we're in christ
[34:13] but christ is not on the earth jesus
[34:15] christ the flesh man is not on the earth
[34:17] so where's his body his body as me and
[34:19] you so we now have it's been transferred
[34:21] to us
[34:22] that you are what you might gather
[34:25] together
[34:26] in one all things in christ both which
[34:29] are in heaven
[34:30] and which on earth even in him and whom
[34:32] also we have obtained an
[34:34] inheritance see you got to obtain
[34:37] something
[34:38] you didn't come here with it you you
[34:40] came here with representation
[34:41] but you didn't come here with nothing
[34:43] special
[34:46] to me that's so simple how in the world
[34:48] can can i walk up
[34:50] on the white throne judgment and say
[34:51] well he put it in me when i was born and
[34:54] i didn't have
[34:54] i have nothing to do and and then i'm
[34:58] eternal i'm going to heaven
[34:59] and then the poor guy that that
[35:02] struggled and never you know god may
[35:04] have came to him and he turned him down
[35:05] but still he's going to look at me and
[35:07] go
[35:07] what'd you do that for him for why
[35:10] didn't you do that for me
[35:11] if it was so easy for him why is it why
[35:13] can't it be so easy for me
[35:14] no no no the only reason that you and i
[35:17] are going to stand not in judgment but
[35:20] at judgment
[35:21] is that we have took on christ gathered
[35:24] together
[35:25] one all things in christ christ was
[35:27] judged for me and you
[35:29] and we don't have to be judged anymore
[35:32] i'll read you a quote in a few minutes
[35:33] where brother brown said we were in the
[35:34] loins of jesus at calvary
[35:36] went to hell with him rose with him
[35:38] ascended with him
[35:40] came back on the day of pentecost with
[35:42] him
[35:45] if you're a gene seed of god that's
[35:46] exactly what i have that's your journey
[35:48] in him also we obtained obtained an
[35:50] inheritance
[35:52] fight every day for it don't we we fight
[35:55] every day
[35:56] being predestinated according to the
[35:58] what purpose of him who worketh all
[36:00] things
[36:01] after the council of his own will
[36:04] amen i like that
[36:10] revelation 13 8 and all that dwell upon
[36:12] the earth shall worship him whose names
[36:13] are not written in the book of life of
[36:14] the lamb
[36:15] slain from the foundation of the world
[36:19] knowing that god wrote us down
[36:21] in a book took a picture of us when we
[36:23] were 16 18 20 years old somewhere
[36:25] and put us in an album and we were
[36:28] waiting to where we're going to read
[36:29] there where we talked about in psalms
[36:30] where in continuance we came we had to
[36:32] come
[36:35] when god in genesis i'm telling you
[36:36] that's how important that genesis
[36:38] if god had never spoke genesis 1 26 you
[36:40] and i would never be here
[36:42] the bride will not be on ever been on
[36:44] the earth
[36:46] but he spoke it and it had to come to
[36:49] pass we were in the
[36:50] gene loins of god
[36:54] when he spoke it it's just so much is
[36:55] done right right
[36:58] but we were written in the book of the
[36:59] life of lamb slain from the foundation
[37:01] of the world all right number two christ
[37:03] the mystery god revealed
[37:05] now god's secret myth that you had
[37:06] before the world began now back in the
[37:08] back part of god's mind there was
[37:09] something that he was trying
[37:11] and going to achieve and look he had a
[37:13] motive in doing it
[37:16] what was the motive in order to let him
[37:18] be expressed
[37:20] because first there wasn't even a moon a
[37:21] star adam a molecule he was god
[37:24] but he exactly wasn't god at that time
[37:26] because god is an object of worship
[37:27] and there was nothing to worship him so
[37:30] in his great mind
[37:31] everybody understand when i put that
[37:32] chart that one spot that
[37:34] that mind of god is where everything's
[37:36] got to start where does everything start
[37:38] with you
[37:40] right here you're good and you're bad
[37:42] starts right here
[37:44] right here then you either let it go out
[37:47] here
[37:48] or you keep it to yourself so in his
[37:51] great mind he wanted these attributes to
[37:53] be expressed but now remember
[37:54] the thoughts of god are eternal
[37:58] the eternal part because remember
[38:03] he thought of adolf hitler but adolf
[38:04] hitler's not an eternal person but now
[38:06] remember
[38:07] he's in the plan every every player
[38:10] everybody you meet the people you don't
[38:12] even meet
[38:13] like i said before there's going to be
[38:15] people given eternal life by what you've
[38:17] done
[38:18] that you'll never know until you get to
[38:19] the white throne judgment and god says
[38:22] he changed your tyre he did this or he
[38:25] opened the door for you i'm going to
[38:26] give him eternal life because of you
[38:30] but you know what let god handle that
[38:32] that's for god to handle that's
[38:34] something that you know it's like daddy
[38:35] said you take that and you put it over
[38:36] here you don't have to deal with it
[38:39] don't worry about it you know don't
[38:41] don't
[38:42] don't walk in a restaurant somebody open
[38:43] the door for you go well you just got
[38:45] eternal life
[38:46] you know don't worry about that just do
[38:49] your daily duty keep going
[38:51] let god handle all that because you know
[38:52] what he already knows that before the
[38:53] foundation of the world
[38:55] all right and in him was love and he was
[38:57] to be father and he was to be son and he
[38:58] was to be a savior and him was to be a
[39:00] healer
[39:01] and all these great attributes that we
[39:03] see already expressed they were in god
[39:05] and listen go back scroll back down
[39:08] how could he be a father you've got to
[39:12] have children
[39:15] how could he be a savior there had to be
[39:19] a people
[39:20] that needed saved how could he be
[39:23] a healer there had to be somebody sick
[39:27] so that he can display that attribute of
[39:29] healer so
[39:30] you and i had to come
[39:34] to express our father
[39:37] and his attributes and all these great
[39:39] attributes that we see
[39:40] already expressed they were in god
[39:43] because see brother brown saw him as a
[39:44] healer he saw him as a savior
[39:47] he called him pup of god so that and he
[39:49] saw all the attributes
[39:51] probably i think more than any prophet
[39:53] he saw all the attributes of god coming
[39:55] together
[39:57] because he went back in the back part of
[39:58] god's mind you know you can say paul
[40:00] could have said
[40:01] he went back in the back part of god's
[40:02] mind but he didn't go in the part that
[40:04] brother branham went
[40:05] because we've got the open book we've
[40:06] got where now that the seals are open
[40:08] and we can see the full plan of
[40:10] redemption
[40:11] now god had a purpose and a hidden
[40:13] mystery and that's what i want to speak
[40:14] on the church this morning the hidden
[40:16] mystery of god that he had in his mind
[40:18] before the world ever began
[40:19] and how it's unfolded itself right down
[40:22] to this present
[40:23] hour that we're living now remember it
[40:25] unfolded to a prophet but remember
[40:27] the prophet went off the scene in 1965
[40:29] but that didn't do away with it
[40:31] he saw all the way to the woman at the
[40:33] white house he saw all the way to
[40:35] to see we think well no it no he was
[40:38] standing
[40:39] prophesying that me and you would be
[40:41] here what would happen when we're here
[40:43] and even happen what's going to happen
[40:45] when we leave
[40:47] according to the bible but he saw it in
[40:50] a vision
[40:52] because there's nowhere in the bible
[40:53] that says the united states
[40:55] was laying in ruins or there would be a
[40:56] woman in the white house right
[40:59] but through the vision that connected
[41:01] with all the scriptures in the bible
[41:03] how that a woman would rule and be in
[41:05] revelation 13 would be the
[41:07] america would be a woman's nation but
[41:10] that had to come from the mind of god
[41:12] through the love letter because it
[41:13] wasn't written on paper
[41:16] but you and i got that love letter
[41:19] all cherish it so much the hidden
[41:22] mystery of god he had in his mind before
[41:23] the world ever began and how that it's
[41:25] unfolded itself right down to this
[41:26] present hour that we're living see
[41:28] then you will understand clearly then
[41:30] you see on i believe
[41:32] what is being done now we know that the
[41:34] next what we come down to now is we're
[41:36] we're coming down where god said let us
[41:39] make man in our own image
[41:41] and there's one word i keep forgetting
[41:43] right here he god
[41:44] said so it's a spoken word
[41:48] we're spoken word children he spoke and
[41:51] something came into being
[41:52] he spoke and the world came into being
[41:55] he made the beast and all the other
[41:56] different things and god said let us
[41:58] make man our own
[41:59] image after our likeness and let them
[42:00] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[42:02] and to fowl the air and over the cattle
[42:04] of all the earth and every
[42:06] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[42:07] earth so god created man in his own
[42:10] image
[42:10] the image of god created in him male and
[42:12] female
[42:13] created he them god blessed them before
[42:17] they even gotten flesh
[42:19] god blessed them and said unto them be
[42:20] fruitful and multiply
[42:23] and replenish the earth and subdue it
[42:26] and have dominion over the fish of the
[42:27] sea and fowl the air
[42:29] and over every living thing that moveth
[42:31] upon the earth what a wonderful thing
[42:34] that god did but then he took that
[42:35] genesis 1 26 man
[42:37] and he put him into flesh right
[42:40] everybody got that
[42:42] and then brother branham we're going to
[42:43] talk about a little bit later brother
[42:44] brown said he put
[42:45] man in five senses to contact the earth
[42:49] see taste feel smelling here everybody
[42:52] got that
[42:52] we've heard it forever and that's what
[42:54] you live look that's what you live by
[42:57] but remember we're given a sixth sense
[42:59] which is faith to look into another
[43:00] dimension
[43:01] that not to believe everything we see
[43:03] not to believe everything we hear
[43:05] unless we check it by that sixth sense
[43:08] right amen
[43:09] we just don't take the five senses
[43:10] because you can you can you take all
[43:12] five of them
[43:15] you can deceive all five of those senses
[43:18] every all five of them you can deceive
[43:20] them and make them
[43:21] see things have you ever looked at those
[43:24] things go to youtube
[43:26] and look up things where you know they
[43:27] give you a bunch of dots and you see
[43:28] like the number nine and five and four
[43:30] and your depth perception you're just
[43:33] looking at dots
[43:34] but once you keep looking see it's
[43:36] always there
[43:38] but your eyes were playing tricks on you
[43:40] and all the different things about
[43:41] um the the different sizes of the uh
[43:45] of the length of things well that's what
[43:46] i mean that's what satan then went to
[43:49] eve and he got her to see
[43:51] to eastfield smelling here all right but
[43:54] it was contrary to the word of god
[43:56] but now you and i are being changed back
[43:58] to the image to where
[43:59] yeah we see but what do we see we see by
[44:02] faith
[44:03] i want to see you you're not going to
[44:05] see jesus tonight standing here
[44:08] in human flesh but jesus is now standing
[44:11] here
[44:11] today and sitting here today in human
[44:13] flesh
[44:14] all right so how far is that from where
[44:17] adam
[44:18] was in the garden and we'll get to talk
[44:19] about when we talk about dimensions
[44:21] i believe adam could just go i mean this
[44:23] world is a big world
[44:25] it was as big then as it is now there
[44:27] just wasn't as many people on it
[44:29] but adam controlled the whole world so
[44:30] he could just go
[44:32] through any i believe he could just
[44:33] travel anywhere he wanted to through the
[44:34] dimensions because brother branham said
[44:36] it was like the holy ghost brooded over
[44:38] the earth and watched after the earth
[44:40] now
[44:40] the holy ghost doesn't need that wall it
[44:43] just goes right through it
[44:45] the day you received the baptism of the
[44:46] holy ghost didn't have to be a physical
[44:48] door open
[44:49] didn't have to cut you in stick it in
[44:50] though it went through another dimension
[44:53] a faster dimension and that faster
[44:56] dimension is what we're heading to now
[44:58] because that sixth dimension folks is
[45:00] right there
[45:02] it's just faster it's a faster dimension
[45:06] folks man has proved that fourth
[45:09] dimension is radio waves well you can
[45:11] put a tv set right here and you can pick
[45:13] up
[45:13] everything that goes through this
[45:14] building unlimited
[45:19] so don't you think god saw before the
[45:21] foundational world he was going to make
[45:23] me and you the same way
[45:24] where we cannot just receive what satan
[45:27] gives us but we can receive what god
[45:28] gives us
[45:29] and by the baptism of the holy ghost
[45:31] there's our spiritual rudder that turns
[45:33] us
[45:34] to and from listen things bombard you
[45:37] all day
[45:39] through the spiritual realm it bombards
[45:41] you and you don't even know it
[45:44] you don't know it i mean it's horrible
[45:47] to say but
[45:48] there's cursing and and everything going
[45:50] through this building right now i could
[45:51] just turn a cell phone on
[45:54] or sorry if there's any truck drivers
[45:56] here but don't ever
[45:57] go to channel 19 on on a cb radio
[46:01] but but it's going right through here
[46:02] now and you being a spiritual being
[46:05] you're picking it up you just don't know
[46:07] it cause it's going faster
[46:09] than you can hear it but if you got a
[46:12] receptor
[46:14] see now we have a receptor of the holy
[46:16] ghost which receives now it filters out
[46:18] all that other stuff we
[46:21] we're praying that it keeps all that
[46:23] away from us because
[46:24] you know this is the worst age because
[46:26] you know what even brother branham when
[46:28] he first started
[46:29] preaching there was not radio waves that
[46:31] much i mean there was a little bit come
[46:33] up in 1945 but now you look at all
[46:35] what's going on now with the cell phones
[46:38] you know you got 600 cable channels that
[46:40] you can watch
[46:41] and not all of them are good but they're
[46:43] running right through this
[46:44] they're they're filling up that fourth
[46:47] dimension
[46:48] remember the bible says hell hath
[46:50] enlarged its gates
[46:52] man had to enlarge the bandwidth
[46:54] bandwidth so now
[46:56] we go to hd and let's go to hd
[47:00] in the word of god because it's a faster
[47:03] faster dimension that we can work in how
[47:06] do you hear from god you don't hear from
[47:08] god in this dimension
[47:09] you hear from god in another dimension
[47:11] amen
[47:16] look at it look at us folks what god's
[47:18] done to us
[47:20] what he's equipped us with every day
[47:24] even when you put a cell phone up to
[47:26] your ear there's other
[47:28] there's other things going through that
[47:30] that you're not hearing
[47:32] because it's in another bandwidth but
[47:34] it's still bombarding
[47:35] your spirit realm kids
[47:40] be careful that's where satan is working
[47:43] right now
[47:45] he's working in that fourth dimension
[47:47] trying to
[47:48] trying to sway you to watch this
[47:52] watch that say this don't say that but
[47:55] you remember one thing
[47:56] your mom and daddy may not hear you but
[47:58] god sure does
[48:00] amen so now let's go through this
[48:06] but i don't think we've and i'm and i'm
[48:08] pr this is what i've been praying the
[48:10] first of the year
[48:11] lord that we tap in more of what you've
[48:13] got for us
[48:15] that we like i said before we may not
[48:17] know
[48:18] what three days from now holds or six
[48:20] months from now holds what knew
[48:21] something but that thing inside of you
[48:23] does
[48:24] that thing inside of you the reason
[48:28] brother branham could
[48:29] step over like he said step over and let
[48:31] god step
[48:32] in he had a prophetic gift amen
[48:36] and god could speak through him and show
[48:38] him things and show him visions but now
[48:40] tell me where that's just for him
[48:45] i thought he said we were to be
[48:49] prophetic people we were to be little
[48:52] messiahs
[48:55] so let's tap into that
[48:59] say lord show me show me what's going to
[49:03] happen
[49:04] show me what's going on show me give me
[49:06] supernatural direction
[49:09] not just the direction from this one in
[49:10] direction from the paper and the news
[49:12] and this and that and the other
[49:13] give me spiritual direction
[49:17] because that thing folks that thing
[49:18] inside of you knows all the way to the
[49:20] body change
[49:22] that's what it's in there for right
[49:24] right
[49:26] and you know what we do
[49:30] wrap it up and tie it up and put a
[49:33] muzzle on it
[49:35] we do
[49:38] i challenge you to open that thing up
[49:41] let's see what god can do for us
[49:43] amen the word was not made to be
[49:46] harnessed it was made to be released it
[49:49] was made to be open not shut
[49:51] amen so now we know let's talk about
[49:54] foreign knowledge for a minute and now
[49:55] we know that all things work together
[49:56] for good to them that love god
[49:58] to them who are what they called
[49:59] according to his purpose many are called
[50:01] but few are chosen
[50:03] for whom he did for no he also did
[50:06] predestinate to be conformed to the
[50:08] image of his son that he might be the
[50:09] firstborn
[50:10] among many brethren moreover whom he did
[50:14] predestinate them he also called
[50:16] so remember it looks to foreknowledge
[50:18] first we've been through this before
[50:21] but those who he called he justified
[50:25] and whom he justified not what you
[50:27] justified is what
[50:28] what some preacher justifies it's what
[50:30] god justifies
[50:33] then he also shall glorify it
[50:38] what shall we say to these things
[50:41] say it with me if god be for us
[50:44] who can be against us amen
[50:48] so by foreknowledge he knew by
[50:50] foreknowledge he knew
[50:51] whether you would or wouldn't watch this
[50:53] right here the word predestinate that's
[50:55] not a good word to use
[50:57] i'm going to let a prophet do that for
[50:58] us i wouldn't be strong enough to do
[51:00] that but he said
[51:02] predestination or predestinate is not a
[51:04] good word to use
[51:05] the word foreknowledge is better because
[51:07] predestination looks back to foreign so
[51:09] what was first if here's
[51:11] if here's predestination and here's for
[51:14] knowledge
[51:15] what's first for knowledge amen he
[51:18] foreknew therefore he could predestinate
[51:22] everything to go on and even
[51:24] predestinate
[51:25] all the way to the future home
[51:30] because there's john in revelations 19
[51:32] or 20 wherever it was where he saw the
[51:33] city coming down
[51:35] what was it that look what it looked
[51:36] like a bride adorned for a husband
[51:39] all the way the very end of the plan
[51:42] they're still the bride
[51:44] the mind of god being unfolded listen
[51:46] the mind of god's not all been unfolded
[51:48] yet
[51:49] until we get to the future home and then
[51:51] after the future home it's going to be
[51:53] unfolding more
[51:55] we're just getting enough to get us out
[51:57] of here
[51:59] and what a wonderful amount we have if
[52:02] you'll just let god work
[52:04] predestination looks back before
[52:06] knowledge and foreknowledge looks to
[52:07] destination
[52:08] but god not making look set in order a
[52:11] little hole that you have to go through
[52:13] and you can't go no other way that's not
[52:17] what he did
[52:18] but god in order to be god he knowed the
[52:21] end from the beginning so he could
[52:22] predict it
[52:24] and set things in order to happen
[52:27] amen i like that you know why
[52:32] there's no mess up in god there's no
[52:34] foul up in god there's no oops moment
[52:36] like we have
[52:37] so i have to put my dependency then
[52:39] that's what i put my dependency on
[52:40] that he's right and he knows what he's
[52:43] talking about
[52:44] i just got to plug myself into that hey
[52:46] man
[52:47] i think about that the other day this is
[52:49] the perfect example you know
[52:52] and you're getting born again you know
[52:54] you can be
[52:55] you can be a um
[52:59] an air conditioner that makes things
[53:01] cold to minus 50 below
[53:05] and you can have the right plug
[53:10] but does it make its own power
[53:13] no you didn't come here with no power
[53:18] but when you take but you know then
[53:20] being the air conditioner that needs the
[53:22] power
[53:23] to work if you know where the power is
[53:25] at
[53:26] if you know where the power source is
[53:28] then what do you do you go over there
[53:30] and you say god
[53:33] i know what i need
[53:36] and when you do that guess what the
[53:38] electricity always was there
[53:40] you weren't you were the air conditioner
[53:43] you were the kokober but if you know
[53:46] where the electricity it's always there
[53:48] it's there all the time unless you
[53:49] physically cut it off there's power
[53:51] running into these circuits until unless
[53:54] you hit the big breaker there's power
[53:55] all
[53:56] enough power there brother danny to make
[53:58] this place as cold as
[53:59] alaska but unless you reach over there
[54:02] and plug it in
[54:03] see that's what you got to do people you
[54:05] have a choice
[54:08] to plug that thing in or just sit here
[54:10] and go i know where the power's at
[54:13] i know i'm just something but i ain't
[54:15] got enough no
[54:16] go and plug the thing in there's your
[54:18] power source there's your eternal life
[54:21] this is not eternal that's eternal but
[54:24] once you plug it in where does it go
[54:26] right inside the air conditioner
[54:29] it makes it run
[54:32] so plug it in amen
[54:36] but if we'd only go back to find out why
[54:37] god made his first man he made him in
[54:39] his own image and god is a spirit
[54:41] so he had to make a spirit man now the
[54:43] word is used here in the fifth verse of
[54:44] predestination predestinate is not a
[54:46] very good word for an evangelist or a
[54:48] minister to use
[54:50] because it kind of confuses the people
[54:51] when you say predestinate and it does
[54:53] because
[54:54] i think it's calvinism is it calvinism
[54:56] it's like i mean it's predetermined i
[54:57] mean it's like you're not going to do
[54:59] anything different than that right there
[55:01] see that's not true on that side then
[55:03] you go to armenianism just whatever but
[55:05] see what brother brown do he pulled them
[55:06] both together
[55:07] right he pulled them again just like he
[55:10] took the two limbs off of the trees and
[55:12] put them together
[55:13] for father son holy ghost and and the
[55:16] oneness or the trinity and oneness
[55:17] pulled them together what that's what
[55:19] the loose ends were that the prophet had
[55:21] to bring the loose ends together
[55:23] tie the cord back plug the electrical
[55:26] cord in
[55:27] and say this is it so predestination
[55:31] speaks looks back to foreknowledge
[55:33] for knowledge looks to destination
[55:35] predestination goes back to
[55:36] foreknowledge
[55:37] foreknowledge goes to destination in
[55:39] other words god didn't say now i'll make
[55:41] this man be this
[55:42] and i'll make this man be that but in
[55:45] order to be god
[55:46] he knew the end from the beginning in
[55:47] other words he knew what that guy was
[55:49] going to do and what this guy was going
[55:50] to do
[55:51] he could say this would happen and that
[55:52] would happen because he was god and
[55:54] knowed where everything would be placed
[55:55] and therefore he could
[55:56] ordain certain things for certain ages
[55:59] you believe that
[56:01] you believe that you were ordained to be
[56:04] in this age right here
[56:08] by foreign knowledge adoption 1960.
[56:12] don't forget that election looks back
[56:13] here here it is i was a kookaburra i was
[56:16] born in sin
[56:16] shaped an iniquity come to the world
[56:18] speaking lies born amongst sinners
[56:20] fathers and mother
[56:21] father and mother and all my whole
[56:22] family centers i was a cuckoo bird
[56:25] but all of a sudden i became a wheat
[56:27] grain how did it happen that what is
[56:29] that
[56:30] election god before the foundation of
[56:32] the world elected that the cuckoo world
[56:34] kocobur was to become a grain of wheat
[56:36] now remember election you got to go look
[56:38] back to foreign knowledge though
[56:40] take it all the way back to foreign
[56:42] knowledge he that you would want it
[56:44] and you elected on your side god voted
[56:48] for you satan voted against you you
[56:49] swing the vote
[56:50] elected that the cucker wer kuckelberg
[56:52] was to become a grain of wheat now i
[56:54] know i'm a grain of wheat because i'm
[56:55] saved
[56:56] how did i do do i do it look back and
[56:59] see that he predestinated it
[57:01] a long time ago that's not a problem
[57:05] for you to look back to that
[57:08] i'm talking about looking back on you
[57:10] what's down here but you can look back
[57:12] and see
[57:12] that god before the foundation of the
[57:14] world that's where you were we're going
[57:15] to get to in just a second
[57:17] i know i'm a grain of wheat because i'm
[57:19] saved how do i do it
[57:21] you know i was thinking the other day
[57:23] brother branham is preaching
[57:24] to presbyterians i don't know what
[57:26] exactly they believed but baptist
[57:28] believed once saved always saved
[57:30] um you got one doctrine of
[57:33] of of denomination that well if you're
[57:36] doing good at the moment you die you're
[57:37] okay but if you don't you're not
[57:40] and see even catholics the same way you
[57:41] know you do your penance and you get put
[57:43] in purgatory and all that stuff
[57:44] but see i believe that's why god said no
[57:46] before the foundation world he said if
[57:47] you got eternal life tonight
[57:49] he was telling those people don't worry
[57:53] if you know you got it look back and see
[57:55] that you were in the mind of god
[57:57] and that you are now a wheat grain and
[58:00] can't be listen god's not an indian
[58:02] giver he can't take a
[58:03] huckleberry and make a wheat germ out of
[58:04] you and then turn around and say no
[58:06] you're not good enough i'm going to make
[58:07] you back a cuckoo bear no way
[58:09] god cannot do that so if you're a wheat
[58:12] germ tonight you always was a wheat germ
[58:14] in the mind of god
[58:18] look back and see that he predestinated
[58:20] a long time ago by foreign knowledge
[58:22] he seen that i would love him
[58:25] see he seen that i would love him
[58:29] so he made a perpetuation through his
[58:32] own son that through him i might become
[58:34] from a cuckolder
[58:35] to a grain of wheat now where i'm at now
[58:39] i'm saved i'm walking in the grace of
[58:40] god what does predestination look
[58:43] to destiny where will he take me to
[58:45] where am i going that's got you
[58:47] there you are i like that
[58:51] that's got you there you are all right
[58:53] number six
[58:54] 1964 questions and answers how can i
[58:57] take a cuckoo bar and make a grain of
[58:59] wheat out of it it's impossible
[59:01] for me to do it it's impossible for you
[59:04] to save yourself
[59:06] no way jose you can't save yourself
[59:12] so accept that
[59:16] accept that it's impossible for you to
[59:18] get good enough and be good enough to be
[59:20] saved
[59:23] the only way it can be is because inside
[59:25] that kookaburra has been transmitted
[59:27] from a cuckoo bird
[59:29] wheat a cucumber to a germ called
[59:32] wheat life then you bury that kookaburra
[59:35] and it'll produce a grain of wheat
[59:37] that's right
[59:38] because there has been a life of wheat
[59:40] put in the kuckelberg
[59:42] and the life of the cuckoo bar has been
[59:44] taken out but the nature of the cuckoo
[59:46] bird is still sticky in other words you
[59:48] still got this thing you still got your
[59:49] memories and conscious effects and
[59:50] imagination
[59:51] and it will be until this new life has
[59:53] fully been developed
[59:54] thank god the bible says old things are
[59:56] passed away behold all things have
[59:58] become new
[1:00:00] you won't remember the bad things you
[1:00:02] won't remember the
[1:00:03] hardships that you went through
[1:00:08] and it will be until this new life has
[1:00:10] fully been developed
[1:00:12] out of the ground and raised up again in
[1:00:14] other words in the resurrection or in
[1:00:16] the body change when it comes forth then
[1:00:18] it's no more cuckover
[1:00:19] but wheat but wheat but while it's here
[1:00:22] on the earth and out of the earth the
[1:00:23] cuckerberg is still sticky
[1:00:25] but it's got the nature on the inside it
[1:00:27] of wheat
[1:00:28] and as long as you're in this life
[1:00:30] you're going to be sticky and have a
[1:00:32] carnal nature
[1:00:33] that's going to bother you as long as
[1:00:34] you live
[1:00:36] but the inside of you you're born again
[1:00:40] and when you're raised up you're in the
[1:00:42] likeness of christ and all the sin has
[1:00:44] gone from your sea
[1:00:45] that's the thing number seven
[1:00:49] the seed shall possess against the enemy
[1:00:52] that's what you are
[1:00:53] we are now a wheat germ a grain of wheat
[1:00:55] in god's garner when we was a cuckleber
[1:00:57] and god changed us from a cuckleberry to
[1:00:59] a grain of wheat
[1:01:01] it makes the fruits different changing
[1:01:02] your own mind
[1:01:04] your own ideas it's the greatest miracle
[1:01:07] that ever happened
[1:01:08] when a man or a woman is born again of
[1:01:10] the spirit of god
[1:01:11] and becomes a new creature in christ
[1:01:13] jesus the greatest miracle
[1:01:15] that you're still in that shell that
[1:01:17] came from mom and daddy you still
[1:01:19] got that old adamic nature you still
[1:01:21] lean back to the old carnal mind but
[1:01:22] inside of you is almighty god
[1:01:27] and he's never going to take it back out
[1:01:31] you look at that example brother adam
[1:01:33] gave of that preacher
[1:01:36] and listen you can be influenced by
[1:01:37] spirits even it took a prophet of god to
[1:01:40] tell us
[1:01:41] that even if you commit suicide you
[1:01:43] still can be born again because see
[1:01:45] there's a lot of people
[1:01:46] a lot of denominations if you commit
[1:01:48] suicide
[1:01:49] you you're hell that you you never were
[1:01:51] a christian
[1:01:53] and some of them are pretty prominent
[1:01:55] baptist for one
[1:01:57] but thank god for a prophet
[1:02:02] that said you can get influenced by
[1:02:04] spirit and commit suicide and still be a
[1:02:06] christian
[1:02:06] right amen that's hard that's hard to
[1:02:10] that's hard to fathom but i can see how
[1:02:13] it happens
[1:02:14] because see memories and conscious
[1:02:16] effects and imagination
[1:02:18] that's still in satan's realm
[1:02:22] i mean god works in there too but you
[1:02:23] can yield yourself to the devil
[1:02:25] look at that preacher that said i ain't
[1:02:27] preaching no more
[1:02:29] i'm done i'm finished with it i'm going
[1:02:31] to get me some beer and i'm going to get
[1:02:33] drunk
[1:02:34] right brother ramsey
[1:02:38] okay he lived for six months brother
[1:02:39] brown said god took his child home so he
[1:02:41] wouldn't marry his name
[1:02:42] what he was a born-again child of god
[1:02:44] yet he let something influence him so
[1:02:46] much
[1:02:46] until he started doing things but i
[1:02:48] promise you you won't do them long
[1:02:52] if you're a child of god he won't mar he
[1:02:54] won't let you but see he didn't take it
[1:02:55] away from brother ramsey either
[1:02:58] he didn't put it in there and said nope
[1:02:59] you're the koco bear the whole time no
[1:03:02] though he had the wheat germ planted but
[1:03:04] he just allowed other things
[1:03:07] to get in his way thank god that we had
[1:03:10] a prophet
[1:03:12] that could tell us these things all
[1:03:14] right let's go to representation we know
[1:03:16] that
[1:03:17] we were talking the other sunday about
[1:03:20] the little woman at the well
[1:03:22] remember now she was standing there in
[1:03:25] front of jesus
[1:03:26] and she was a prostitute she was a
[1:03:30] she had all kind of husband she was
[1:03:31] living with a man now she must have had
[1:03:33] some men problems somewhere down the
[1:03:35] road
[1:03:37] but remember somewhere though she heard
[1:03:40] the word of god
[1:03:42] and that word is the seed nothing else
[1:03:46] and what was happening was god was
[1:03:49] standing in front of her
[1:03:51] jesus christ that was the word that was
[1:03:54] the seed that she was waiting on because
[1:03:56] she's still
[1:03:57] standing over here she said we know
[1:04:00] when messiah comes he'll do these things
[1:04:04] and he said i am he well that didn't do
[1:04:07] nothing but just spark
[1:04:08] exactly she said oh this is what we've
[1:04:11] been waiting
[1:04:12] on and she run back into the into the
[1:04:14] city and said come see a man
[1:04:19] she had representation the prophet said
[1:04:22] the representation of foreknowledge
[1:04:24] knowing he was going to meet that woman
[1:04:25] knowing what she was
[1:04:26] she could have just done like the
[1:04:28] pharisees and said
[1:04:30] you just guessed that buddy i'll see you
[1:04:32] later there's no telling how many people
[1:04:33] that jesus met
[1:04:34] that done that right he's just a good
[1:04:37] guy because you read the bible
[1:04:39] if you read the comments of the bible oh
[1:04:41] he was a good man that was joseph's boy
[1:04:43] that wasn't joseph's boy am
[1:04:46] that wasn't joseph's child but that's
[1:04:49] all that's joseph's boy that's the
[1:04:50] carpenter's son
[1:04:52] he's a wine bibber he he hangs around
[1:04:54] centers and
[1:04:56] hmm how about that
[1:05:00] but they didn't have predestination from
[1:05:03] predestination
[1:05:05] and what comes before predestination for
[1:05:07] knowledge
[1:05:10] this is one he foreknew that would come
[1:05:14] look she was looking look
[1:05:17] she's got representation see and then
[1:05:19] she was looking
[1:05:20] for this to be made flesh doesn't matter
[1:05:23] what kind of condition she was in
[1:05:25] somewhere in her life she had heard
[1:05:28] mama daddy sister brother some preacher
[1:05:31] talk about when the messiah gets here
[1:05:36] she might have been living with five
[1:05:37] people she might have been doing all the
[1:05:39] bad things in the world but something
[1:05:40] inside of her amen i believe that there
[1:05:43] was something
[1:05:44] different because she got representation
[1:05:47] that she
[1:05:48] said roll it up
[1:05:53] she said sir i perceive that you're a
[1:05:56] prophet
[1:05:58] now when we know the messiah which is
[1:06:00] called christ will come and when he does
[1:06:03] he'll do this he said i am he
[1:06:07] and that sparked that seed that she had
[1:06:10] read
[1:06:11] somewhere in the old testament where the
[1:06:13] virgin shall conceive and bring forth a
[1:06:15] child and his name shall be emmanuel
[1:06:17] and he will come and he'll be come out
[1:06:19] from a tribe of judah and he'll come
[1:06:21] from this and he'll come from that
[1:06:23] all that went going through her mind but
[1:06:25] listen
[1:06:26] she would not have got eternal life if
[1:06:29] she was just a prostitute
[1:06:31] and didn't not do nothing but read good
[1:06:33] homes and garden
[1:06:35] you understand what i mean but god
[1:06:36] foreknew that he saw that
[1:06:40] he approached her thank god he
[1:06:42] approached her he was in human flesh
[1:06:46] no more doubt you didn't have to explain
[1:06:47] it she saw it she believed it the way
[1:06:49] she went what did it do
[1:06:50] to her it redeemed her now remember we
[1:06:52] said that before
[1:06:53] she didn't get eternal life right there
[1:06:56] right
[1:06:56] no way folks listen jesus hasn't died
[1:07:00] yet
[1:07:02] now let me give you a little thought she
[1:07:05] was inside of him
[1:07:08] her representation was inside of jesus
[1:07:10] christ
[1:07:12] because if we were in the loins of jesus
[1:07:13] christ and went to calvary and she
[1:07:15] became a
[1:07:16] born-again believer she was right there
[1:07:17] with him same man was mary
[1:07:21] mary his mother had to go to pentecost
[1:07:23] to receive the holy ghost
[1:07:25] but what she needed was inside the sun
[1:07:27] and shimmer
[1:07:29] you'd think if anybody had a
[1:07:32] what would you say a free pass to heaven
[1:07:35] would be the one that suckled him and
[1:07:37] kept him and
[1:07:38] nope no god has no respect to a person
[1:07:43] there's no telling how many virgins god
[1:07:45] came to and said will you do this
[1:07:47] and they'll say no but mary said be it
[1:07:51] unto me
[1:07:52] according to thy word your words will
[1:07:55] condemn
[1:07:56] you by your words you shall be justified
[1:07:59] and by your words you shall be
[1:08:00] condemned what does redeem mean bring
[1:08:03] back
[1:08:04] why didn't he get the priest he never
[1:08:06] was up there
[1:08:08] he had no representation he came to
[1:08:10] redeem that which had fallen
[1:08:12] in the fall this got messed up with that
[1:08:14] girl
[1:08:15] but god had her in his thinking there go
[1:08:18] back to the thinking before the
[1:08:19] foundation of the world
[1:08:21] and he came to cleanse her then he she
[1:08:24] had eternal life see where the priest
[1:08:27] what did it do to him sent him right
[1:08:28] back to his destination
[1:08:31] he had nothing to begin with only
[1:08:33] intellectual learning now listen friends
[1:08:34] the only thing you've got is just
[1:08:36] intellectual learning
[1:08:37] you get something different from that
[1:08:39] and you'll never be able to get it
[1:08:40] unless you've got representation
[1:08:43] see now there i can go with
[1:08:46] always was because god can't change his
[1:08:50] mind
[1:08:51] but he saw though what you would choose
[1:08:53] he saw though
[1:08:54] what the woman at the well would choose
[1:08:56] he saw that
[1:08:57] caiaphas would hate him
[1:09:01] hate him he said salvation is of the jew
[1:09:05] woman we know what you're not what
[1:09:06] you're talking about
[1:09:07] we know what sorry we know what we're
[1:09:09] talking about he said you worship you
[1:09:11] don't even know what
[1:09:12] but you're supposed to know the word see
[1:09:14] how it was supposed to be but see
[1:09:15] he was watching now why he got to what
[1:09:19] is he going to do now brother brown i'm
[1:09:20] in another quote he says he was catching
[1:09:22] her spirit
[1:09:23] right right he was catching her spirit
[1:09:25] y'all wake up
[1:09:26] grief is wednesday night
[1:09:30] he was watching now why he's going to
[1:09:32] what is he going to do
[1:09:34] prove his word
[1:09:37] why because he's fixing to discern right
[1:09:39] now he's he's seeing a vision he's
[1:09:41] discerning
[1:09:42] the thoughts of her heart by the way go
[1:09:44] get your husband and come here
[1:09:46] she said i don't have any husband he
[1:09:47] said you've told the truth lady
[1:09:49] see because you've had five and the one
[1:09:51] you now have is not your husband see
[1:09:52] what something happened
[1:09:54] something took life what was it that
[1:09:57] word that she had heard
[1:09:58] it sparked something she's like man this
[1:10:00] is the guy
[1:10:03] this is the one we've been looking for
[1:10:06] now if it hadn't been in there to begin
[1:10:08] with what that predestinated thought
[1:10:11] in the mind of god is what she tapped
[1:10:14] into
[1:10:17] she had no if she hadn't had
[1:10:18] representation
[1:10:20] from predestination which was before
[1:10:22] predestination
[1:10:23] from foreknowledge it never
[1:10:27] took hold god who is rich in mercy watch
[1:10:30] this one
[1:10:31] now if you've got eternal life tonight
[1:10:34] if if
[1:10:34] if if we have eternal life then we
[1:10:37] always were
[1:10:39] because there's only one form of eternal
[1:10:41] life
[1:10:42] we always were always were eternal in
[1:10:45] the mind of god
[1:10:47] and the reason we were because we are a
[1:10:50] part of god and god is the only thing
[1:10:52] that's eternal
[1:10:53] and like as melchizedek received times
[1:10:55] from abraham and it was allotted to his
[1:10:57] great-grandson levi
[1:10:58] who was yet in the loins of abraham paid
[1:11:01] tithe for he was yet in the loins of
[1:11:03] abraham god showing
[1:11:04] predestination showing foreign knowledge
[1:11:09] i want to speak on that over in the
[1:11:10] other place one morning who is this
[1:11:11] melchizedek now read the book who is mr
[1:11:13] kels who is this melchizedek
[1:11:15] now notice way back god knew this boy
[1:11:17] coming down he knowed all things
[1:11:19] now we are a part of god you always was
[1:11:22] you don't remember it
[1:11:24] because you were only an attribute in
[1:11:25] god listen you were
[1:11:27] you were literally inside of your daddy
[1:11:31] when he was a little boy literally
[1:11:35] in what in dna
[1:11:38] not as a person you don't become a
[1:11:42] person until you get a soul
[1:11:43] and you didn't get a soul inside your
[1:11:45] regular daddy come on people
[1:11:47] good grief but through what a betting
[1:11:49] ground
[1:11:50] allowed by god between a union of a man
[1:11:52] and a woman your body was produced and
[1:11:55] then god had to give you a soul
[1:11:56] right your mom and dad didn't give you a
[1:11:58] soul they got you here so god could give
[1:12:00] you one
[1:12:02] but you were in his thinking you were
[1:12:03] only an attribute in god
[1:12:06] you were only in his thinking your very
[1:12:08] name if it ever was on the book of life
[1:12:10] it was put there before the foundation
[1:12:12] of the world
[1:12:13] he knew what you were right i'm only
[1:12:16] saying this not to mix up doctrine
[1:12:18] but to straighten it out that we might
[1:12:20] get away from this fear and scare there
[1:12:22] is
[1:12:23] the fear and scare what is the fear and
[1:12:26] scare oh we may not make it oh well you
[1:12:27] might
[1:12:28] if you're if you're if you you know if
[1:12:30] you get caught having a bad thought and
[1:12:31] you die you go into hell no
[1:12:32] that's all fear that's fear fear fear
[1:12:35] you don't
[1:12:36] know who you are you are not going to be
[1:12:38] but now you
[1:12:39] are the sons of god you are son of god
[1:12:42] before the foundation of the world
[1:12:44] you were an attribute in the mind of god
[1:12:46] you were inside your literal daddy
[1:12:48] and even go back to your granddad and
[1:12:50] your great-great-granddaddy
[1:12:52] in in gene in genetic form
[1:12:55] not running around you couldn't find you
[1:12:58] but see god being god you couldn't find
[1:13:01] us in god only through the word but he
[1:13:04] was the word
[1:13:05] he was the word made flesh you don't
[1:13:08] know who you are you're going to be but
[1:13:09] now you are the sons of god see you
[1:13:11] always were the sons of god
[1:13:12] for when god had you in where in his
[1:13:15] thinking
[1:13:16] at the beginning you have to be some
[1:13:19] part of you your life that's in you now
[1:13:21] had to be with god
[1:13:23] before there
[1:13:26] let's continue on let's go to the very
[1:13:29] bottom of that quote if you don't mind
[1:13:31] it seemed like there was something in
[1:13:33] you that cried out we've
[1:13:34] read this last sunday there was god
[1:13:37] somewhere yet you were a sinner
[1:13:40] you remember that amen certainly
[1:13:43] how many times did you you friends go
[1:13:46] out and party and
[1:13:48] you don't go with them because of some
[1:13:51] something going on something
[1:13:52] something that just didn't feel right
[1:13:55] you might have just thought it as luck
[1:13:57] but folks i don't believe in luck
[1:14:00] because you have an angel if you're
[1:14:01] going to come to a spot where god's
[1:14:02] going to talk to you you're going to
[1:14:04] have to make it to that time
[1:14:07] but one day after a while you heard the
[1:14:10] gospel
[1:14:10] that was that little form of life in you
[1:14:13] then
[1:14:15] form the word
[1:14:19] we all were preached to hello
[1:14:22] we all were preached to even when we
[1:14:23] were little kids
[1:14:26] and where did it stick somewhere
[1:14:29] it's stuck up here
[1:14:32] where's the first womb i'm here right
[1:14:35] right
[1:14:36] and then after a while you heard the
[1:14:37] gospel maybe you went to church you
[1:14:39] picked this out and that out went from
[1:14:40] denomination to denomination but one day
[1:14:42] you being part of god you had to be part
[1:14:45] of the word so where did you
[1:14:46] where is your representation in the word
[1:14:50] amen and then you heard the word
[1:14:53] you knew where you came from you knowed
[1:14:56] what was the truth
[1:14:58] you were always the seed was in you
[1:15:00] always what that planting of the word
[1:15:02] was in you
[1:15:05] the word seen the word

[1:15:31] that

[1:15:52] didn't read it the other day can't you
[1:15:54] see where we're standing
[1:15:55] life is in the grain again what is it
[1:15:59] just exactly like the same grain that
[1:16:01] went in the ground now he's talking
[1:16:02] about us being like jesus christ
[1:16:04] am i okay with that that's what he's
[1:16:05] saying just exactly like the same grain
[1:16:08] that went in the ground the same
[1:16:10] jesus in the bride form
[1:16:13] same power same church same thing same
[1:16:16] word
[1:16:17] the same word sucked up through these
[1:16:20] and came out here and came to a head
[1:16:22] where in this age and all that life that
[1:16:25] come up through here
[1:16:26] picked up his people what luther wesley
[1:16:28] pentecost
[1:16:30] amen it was the same life
[1:16:33] now it's forming up into a head for the
[1:16:36] rapture
[1:16:37] speaking on that tomorrow night or next
[1:16:38] night one lord willing well you
[1:16:40] separated from your first union
[1:16:42] by spiritual death what you were born
[1:16:45] i'm going to read it here in just a few
[1:16:46] minutes you were born between
[1:16:49] satan and eve well you separated from
[1:16:53] your first union by spiritual death now
[1:16:55] you are born
[1:16:56] again are remarried again
[1:17:00] to the new spiritual union of not your
[1:17:02] natural life for the things of the world
[1:17:06] but of eternal life that germ that was
[1:17:10] in you at the beginning
[1:17:12] found you amen
[1:17:16] now let's read this one that nobody
[1:17:18] likes in the whole message
[1:17:19] nobody likes to read this one well we do
[1:17:22] because see this this break sure
[1:17:26] this break sure uh always was
[1:17:30] that's the matter today you want some
[1:17:32] kind of phony makeup screaming jumping
[1:17:34] speaking in tongues or something instead
[1:17:35] of waiting
[1:17:36] for the real word of god to be made
[1:17:38] manifest through the bride
[1:17:42] them kind that takes the word is god's
[1:17:45] true
[1:17:45] bride bringing forth children
[1:17:49] they can't die a child the bride brings
[1:17:52] forth on the word
[1:17:54] cannot die because you now are the word
[1:18:00] did you get it she can't die because she
[1:18:02] that child can't die because she's a
[1:18:04] word child she's a seed child
[1:18:08] she's an eternal child hallelujah that's
[1:18:11] exactly what jesus was a spoken
[1:18:14] eternal child don't have to die but he
[1:18:17] did in order to pay the debt
[1:18:20] that's the only way it could be paid
[1:18:22] nobody else could do it they were all
[1:18:24] sexual born after the devil his plan
[1:18:28] you got it now but look watch this now
[1:18:31] but every man no matter whether he's
[1:18:34] pope
[1:18:34] priest bishop prophet
[1:18:38] whatever he is he dies because he's a
[1:18:41] hybrid
[1:18:42] that's exactly he was born between
[1:18:45] satan and eve right
[1:18:49] you toot your whistle all you want to
[1:18:53] you can toot it when you're born again
[1:18:55] but you can't toot it when you get born
[1:18:56] between them two people
[1:18:59] and you know what that's meaning the act
[1:19:01] between satan and eve
[1:19:02] is how you got here
[1:19:06] between your mom and daddy by permissive
[1:19:07] will right
[1:19:09] but you weren't supposed to be look he
[1:19:12] says
[1:19:12] and they call it whatever you want to
[1:19:16] it was satan and need the original word
[1:19:18] had nothing
[1:19:19] to do with it that genesis 1 26 man had
[1:19:23] nothing to do
[1:19:24] with that union between satan and eve
[1:19:28] or that union between your mom and your
[1:19:29] daddy
[1:19:31] but by permissive will to get you here
[1:19:33] it had to come that way
[1:19:35] to be a healer savior redeemer and all
[1:19:37] these other attributes
[1:19:38] the original word was life he had hybrid
[1:19:40] it and it brought
[1:19:43] death we good with that all right that's
[1:19:46] the hood of this melchizedek
[1:19:48] to me this explains the whole thing just
[1:19:50] read it slow when you get home you can
[1:19:52] read it again
[1:19:54] they bring it they have this online so
[1:19:55] you can read it and some of you have the
[1:19:58] have the notes now we see the attribute
[1:20:00] sons of his spirit have not yet entered
[1:20:02] into the word form body
[1:20:03] but a theophany this body is subject to
[1:20:06] the word
[1:20:07] and earnest waiting for the earnest
[1:20:08] change of the body so we're waiting
[1:20:10] for this kokomo right here to be changed
[1:20:12] into wheat but we had to have some kind
[1:20:14] of wheat to get started with
[1:20:16] we got to have a wheat germ inside to
[1:20:18] get started to make that wheat plant
[1:20:19] bring forth wheat life
[1:20:22] that's why you had to be reborn
[1:20:23] nicodemus you have to be born again
[1:20:27] born from above not between your mom and
[1:20:28] daddy
[1:20:30] but a theophany this body is subject to
[1:20:32] the word in earnest
[1:20:33] waiting for the earnest change of the
[1:20:35] body now the difference between him and
[1:20:37] you as son
[1:20:38] see he was at the beginning the word
[1:20:41] remember he was an eternal child he was
[1:20:42] eternal before there was an eternal
[1:20:45] hello jesus christ never
[1:20:49] anyway now the difference between him
[1:20:52] and you as son
[1:20:53] he was at the beginning of the word in
[1:20:55] morphy body
[1:20:57] now in other words you got to remember
[1:20:58] this watch listen to me
[1:21:02] jesus christ was the son of god we know
[1:21:05] that
[1:21:05] but remember he was not a son like me
[1:21:07] and your son
[1:21:10] he was not in an act he wasn't in
[1:21:14] the father running around as an
[1:21:16] attribute he was the attribute
[1:21:18] he was the father made manifested that's
[1:21:21] the difference in me and you that's why
[1:21:22] adam
[1:21:23] couldn't save eve he was not a savior
[1:21:25] that was not his attribute
[1:21:29] but god said i'll put enmity i'll come
[1:21:31] and save this thing i'll come and put it
[1:21:33] back
[1:21:35] because look now the difference between
[1:21:36] him and you as son see he was at the
[1:21:38] beginning of the word
[1:21:40] now see you potentially were but you
[1:21:41] can't be the word
[1:21:43] formed body in what i'm looking at right
[1:21:45] now you had to come born in sin
[1:21:47] born between satan and eve he was at the
[1:21:50] beginning of the word an immorphy body
[1:21:52] he came in and lived in that in the
[1:21:53] person of melchizedek
[1:21:54] then later we never see no more of
[1:21:56] melchizedek because he becomes jesus
[1:21:58] christ
[1:21:59] not two different people whatever the
[1:22:03] attribute that came to abraham
[1:22:06] it's the same attribute that died on the
[1:22:07] cross it's just the problem was
[1:22:09] melchizedek was the body spoken into
[1:22:11] existence
[1:22:12] as a full-grown man where jesus was born
[1:22:14] a baby like you are
[1:22:17] so he could be called your brother he
[1:22:18] could be what your kinsmen
[1:22:20] redeemer he couldn't just be a redeemer
[1:22:22] he had to be a kinsmen
[1:22:23] redeemer and redeem back that what was
[1:22:26] lost
[1:22:30] i thought brother bob i knew the plan of
[1:22:32] salvation i didn't know it as much as i
[1:22:34] knew it now
[1:22:35] and you should take every piece of that
[1:22:37] plan of salvation and see how god what
[1:22:39] he had to go through to get you here
[1:22:43] regardless of all the other stuff what
[1:22:46] the devil throwed out and he was god's
[1:22:48] right-hand man
[1:22:49] god let him deal with all these
[1:22:50] different things yet god had a plan to
[1:22:52] get you here
[1:22:55] and that was nothing nothing
[1:22:59] going to stop it you know why
[1:23:03] because if he thought it it's gotta come
[1:23:06] to pass
[1:23:08] and it can't change from there to here
[1:23:11] amen
[1:23:13] he just changed his mask same person
[1:23:17] same personality but he put on another
[1:23:18] mask and became melchizedek
[1:23:20] then that melchizedek couldn't come over
[1:23:22] here and be jesus christ
[1:23:23] the as a human mortal man
[1:23:27] born though come as a man he had to come
[1:23:29] as a baby because you had to come as a
[1:23:30] baby
[1:23:32] then later we never heard no more
[1:23:33] melchizedek because became he became
[1:23:35] jesus christ melchizedek was the priest
[1:23:37] but he became jesus christ now you
[1:23:40] bypass that
[1:23:41] remember you didn't come full grown
[1:23:44] with an eternal body or an eternal soul
[1:23:48] you didn't come that way you bypassed
[1:23:50] that remember you had to go around it
[1:23:52] you couldn't come straight
[1:23:55] from attribute right down into human
[1:23:59] flesh
[1:24:00] because you're lost we'll prove that
[1:24:03] next time we preach and we'll see that
[1:24:05] when the sin happened there was no way
[1:24:07] for man to get back here
[1:24:09] and there was no way listen to me there
[1:24:12] was no way for god to get to you
[1:24:16] oh well
[1:24:20] why didn't he give moses the new birth
[1:24:22] why didn't he give
[1:24:23] isaiah the new birth why didn't he give
[1:24:25] all these people in the old testament
[1:24:27] because he had to come himself and he
[1:24:30] was only he was the father
[1:24:32] he was jehovah god down through the old
[1:24:34] testament right here though
[1:24:36] right here blood of bulls and goats
[1:24:38] covering
[1:24:39] it was but when he come he come down
[1:24:42] through that
[1:24:45] he came down through all that junk and
[1:24:47] became human flesh
[1:24:49] so that he could take and take that
[1:24:51] blood of bulls and goats away and put
[1:24:52] his own blood the blood of a man
[1:24:54] not the blood of bulls and goats and the
[1:24:56] blood of a man that can multiply
[1:24:59] and replenish the earth by spoken word
[1:25:01] not by sex
[1:25:04] because you came like adam like me
[1:25:06] because remember adam had sex with eve
[1:25:08] adam had more children that you
[1:25:10] understand what i'm talking about like
[1:25:11] me
[1:25:12] you became from attribute to the flesh
[1:25:14] to be tempted
[1:25:15] but when this life is finished here if
[1:25:17] this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we
[1:25:18] have one already waiting remember it's
[1:25:20] not up in heaven
[1:25:24] you are who you are
[1:25:28] where's the attribute of god if you're
[1:25:29] born again it's not sitting up in heaven
[1:25:30] somewhere
[1:25:31] it's down inside of you but when this
[1:25:34] life is finished here if this earthly
[1:25:35] type and i can be dissolved we have one
[1:25:37] already waiting
[1:25:39] that's where we go that is the word
[1:25:42] then we can look back and see what we've
[1:25:44] done and now we don't understand it
[1:25:46] we have never become the word in other
[1:25:48] words we've never become the total word
[1:25:50] of god
[1:25:51] told the word of god you've got to go
[1:25:52] back to genesis 1 26
[1:25:55] now it's come down and come inside of
[1:25:57] you but you've still got the cuckerberg
[1:25:59] shell
[1:26:00] but then look clearly makes it clear
[1:26:04] you will never be the word unless you
[1:26:06] was a thought
[1:26:07] at the beginning that proves the
[1:26:10] predestination which that's not a good
[1:26:12] word so that proves the foreknowledge of
[1:26:14] god
[1:26:16] i'm just quoting the prophet see you
[1:26:18] can't be the word unless your thought
[1:26:20] you had to be in the thinking first
[1:26:24] but see in order to stand temptation you
[1:26:26] had to bypass that eternal genesis 1 26
[1:26:29] man
[1:26:30] you didn't come with that god held that
[1:26:34] but god came here on earth with that
[1:26:36] inside of him called jesus christ
[1:26:38] the very soul of almighty god was jesus
[1:26:42] christ and where were you in the
[1:26:43] attribute form you were in there
[1:26:46] i'm going to read your quote here in
[1:26:47] just a second if you'll just give me a
[1:26:48] few minutes
[1:26:50] you had to come down here in flesh to be
[1:26:52] tempted by sin
[1:26:54] and then if you stand all the father
[1:26:55] hath given me will come to me and i'll
[1:26:57] raise him up the last day see you had to
[1:26:59] be first
[1:27:00] and then you see he came right down the
[1:27:02] regular line from attribute
[1:27:04] before the foundation of the world his
[1:27:05] name is put on a lounge book of life
[1:27:07] and from that he becomes the word the
[1:27:09] theophany that could appear disappear
[1:27:11] then he became flesh and returned back
[1:27:13] again resurrected that same body and
[1:27:14] glorified conditions come by jesus
[1:27:16] christ
[1:27:16] but you bypassed the theophany and
[1:27:18] became flesh man
[1:27:21] to be tempted by sin and then if this
[1:27:24] earthly tabernacle is dissolved we have
[1:27:25] one already waiting
[1:27:27] we have not yet the body see when those
[1:27:29] when those when those saints died and
[1:27:32] stepped into that sixth dimension they
[1:27:33] couldn't take that they couldn't bring
[1:27:34] that
[1:27:35] body with them right but there was a
[1:27:38] body being built inside of their human
[1:27:40] body
[1:27:42] a theophany the genesis 1 26 man
[1:27:46] was being nourished and then what when
[1:27:48] they stepped over into a faster
[1:27:50] dimension
[1:27:51] the body can't go it has to stay here in
[1:27:54] time life and matter
[1:27:55] matter means they can't get out of the
[1:27:56] grave because it's solid
[1:28:00] but you didn't have to open the door to
[1:28:02] let their soul go outside
[1:28:04] or go into that sixth dimension they
[1:28:06] just stepped into a faster dimension
[1:28:10] but look when this body
[1:28:13] receives the spirit of god the immortal
[1:28:16] life inside of you it
[1:28:17] throws this body in subjection
[1:28:21] to god it throws this body
[1:28:26] into subjection by god
[1:28:31] number 13. look sons and daughters was
[1:28:34] in god at the beginning amen
[1:28:35] where were you job when the sons of god
[1:28:37] shouted for joy
[1:28:39] back before the eternal
[1:28:42] but we weren't people running around
[1:28:45] listen
[1:28:46] just think if you were all knowing
[1:28:51] it didn't matter how much time it took
[1:28:54] if you knew in your loins that by the
[1:28:57] spoken word of god you could create
[1:28:59] six million sons and daughters
[1:29:04] you'll be so happy because that's the
[1:29:06] eternal people that's gonna spend
[1:29:08] eternity with you
[1:29:10] that's what he was looking at that's
[1:29:12] what he was shouting for joy
[1:29:14] he saw you he saw us
[1:29:17] develop he saw the seventh church age he
[1:29:20] saw the junk that we had to go through
[1:29:23] and he said i'm pleased to dwell in
[1:29:25] those people
[1:29:28] sons and daughters within god at the
[1:29:29] beginning now look you've got eternal
[1:29:31] life you say
[1:29:32] you got eternal life you say we believe
[1:29:34] it that we got eternal life where
[1:29:35] there's only one form of eternal life
[1:29:37] and that's god
[1:29:38] that's the only thing that is turned
[1:29:40] eternal as god
[1:29:42] then if you've got eternal life if
[1:29:45] that life that's in you always was and
[1:29:47] you were in the loins of god
[1:29:51] before there was even a world what is
[1:29:52] the loins of god it's the word of god
[1:29:54] not down here
[1:29:56] it's the word of god remember we're born
[1:29:57] from up here from god
[1:30:00] you were in the loins of god before
[1:30:02] there ever was a world and
[1:30:03] when the word itself jesus himself is
[1:30:06] called the word and in saint john 1
[1:30:08] in the beginning was the word where it
[1:30:09] was with god word was god
[1:30:11] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:30:12] among us then you were in the loins of
[1:30:15] jesus
[1:30:16] and went to calvary with him
[1:30:20] you died with him let me interject a
[1:30:23] little bit you went to hell with him
[1:30:26] you don't have to go to hell you already
[1:30:28] been there
[1:30:29] and you came out victorious you came out
[1:30:32] with the keys
[1:30:35] i'll clap myself you came out with the
[1:30:37] keys
[1:30:42] you died with him you raised with him
[1:30:45] and today we're sitting in heavenly
[1:30:47] places in him filled with his spirit sun
[1:30:50] and daughters of god
[1:30:51] die with him raised with him sure now
[1:30:54] then now now you can fellowship with him
[1:30:56] you couldn't fellowship in other words
[1:30:58] you couldn't fellowship back there
[1:31:00] because you were just a word in him a
[1:31:02] seed
[1:31:03] where in him listen your
[1:31:08] your natural mom and daddy didn't carry
[1:31:10] that seed
[1:31:13] you can carry the word uh-uh you carried
[1:31:16] natural seed
[1:31:17] because you had to come through satan
[1:31:18] and eve you had to come the natural way
[1:31:21] god had to rebirth you
[1:31:24] that's why it's called reborn that's why
[1:31:27] it's called a new birth
[1:31:29] you were reborn from where jesus said
[1:31:31] from above
[1:31:33] that's where it all started that's the
[1:31:34] mind of god but now he has manifested
[1:31:37] you
[1:31:38] and now he wants you to fellowship with
[1:31:39] him why'd he get you out far to
[1:31:41] fellowship with you
[1:31:43] then he came down was made flesh so he
[1:31:45] could perfectly fellowship with you
[1:31:47] see the perfect fellowship oh my them
[1:31:50] deep mysteries of god how wonderful
[1:31:53] see god could not fellowship in the
[1:31:55] spirit so god became man with us
[1:31:59] they tried to figure him out all during
[1:32:00] the old testament never could figure him

[1:33:44] number 14 magicians get ready to come
[1:33:45] invisible union this one i
[1:33:48] listen to this if you're married to
[1:33:50] christ
[1:33:51] christ is the word of god now look if
[1:33:54] you're married to christ
[1:33:56] christ is the word of god in saint john
[1:33:59] the first chapter said in the beginning
[1:34:00] was the word the word was with god and
[1:34:02] the word was god
[1:34:03] and the same was made flesh and dwelt
[1:34:05] among us christ was the living word
[1:34:08] he always was the word he is still the
[1:34:11] word
[1:34:11] he always will be the word he was
[1:34:15] only the manifestation of the attributes
[1:34:17] of god
[1:34:18] for he was the son of god not a son of
[1:34:21] god he was the son of god
[1:34:22] all the attributes were in him every one
[1:34:25] of them
[1:34:26] and look and any son is the attribute of
[1:34:30] his father
[1:34:31] just as you were in the genes of your
[1:34:32] father now naturally
[1:34:34] in the body of your father when he was a
[1:34:36] young boy
[1:34:37] you were in him yet he could not have
[1:34:40] fellowship with you
[1:34:41] because he didn't know you but then
[1:34:44] through the bedding ground of a mother
[1:34:45] you were brought forth into the earth
[1:34:47] and became in the image of your father
[1:34:50] earthly then he could fellowship with
[1:34:52] you
[1:34:53] and so were you sons of god and
[1:34:56] daughters of god before there even was a
[1:34:58] moon star molecule
[1:35:00] you were sons and daughters of god for
[1:35:02] you are only the
[1:35:04] physical manifestation of the attributes
[1:35:07] that was in god at the beginning
[1:35:09] physical
[1:35:10] you had to come down here and get in
[1:35:12] flesh so that you can listen
[1:35:16] how do you worship god in spirit and
[1:35:18] truth right
[1:35:19] but where's that spirit it's inside your
[1:35:21] cuckoo bird
[1:35:23] you make that kuckerberg raise his hands
[1:35:25] you make that cuckleberg not look at a
[1:35:27] woman
[1:35:28] look over here you make that huckleberry
[1:35:30] do all these different things amen
[1:35:32] why because you're a son and daughter of
[1:35:33] god you heard from your theophany amen
[1:35:35] you heard from you heard the word of god
[1:35:40] you were sons and daughters of god for
[1:35:42] you are the um for you are
[1:35:43] only the physical manifestation of the
[1:35:45] attribute that was in god at the
[1:35:47] beginning
[1:35:48] for there's only one form of eternal
[1:35:49] life and that was you
[1:35:52] before now look before not not when you
[1:35:54] were born a baby
[1:35:56] before the foundation of the world you
[1:35:58] don't know nothing about it
[1:36:01] neither do you know when you was in your
[1:36:04] earthly father
[1:36:06] but you are manifested too in his image
[1:36:09] in the image of god you are made
[1:36:12] and you were manifested for the glory
[1:36:15] and the fellowship of god
[1:36:17] and therefore this is going to sum the
[1:36:19] whole thing up right here
[1:36:20] and therefore as sure as your gene had
[1:36:23] to be in your father
[1:36:25] before your natural birth your spiritual
[1:36:28] gene had to be where not in your daddy
[1:36:31] had to be in god because you're an
[1:36:34] expression of the attribute of his
[1:36:36] thoughts
[1:36:37] before the foundation of the world
[1:36:41] listen we as fathers
[1:36:45] loved it when we went into that waiting
[1:36:47] room and we knew there was a baby coming
[1:36:52] but when i was growing up you didn't
[1:36:53] know the sex of the child so it was
[1:36:55] either it was a big surprise then
[1:36:57] right now you can find out three days
[1:36:59] after so
[1:37:01] there's no secret to it but what about
[1:37:03] though look at phil
[1:37:04] the emotion men feel the emotion
[1:37:07] women you feel the emotion of knowing
[1:37:09] that there's something coming
[1:37:10] there's a life coming don't you think on
[1:37:14] the day you got born again
[1:37:18] that your daddy was standing right there
[1:37:22] and he was saying i'm fixing to see one
[1:37:24] of my kids
[1:37:26] i'm finally after 2000 after 6 000
[1:37:30] years when i spoke genesis 1 26
[1:37:33] i'm now seeing one of my children being
[1:37:36] born
[1:37:39] well if a human man could be happy and a
[1:37:41] human woman could be happy
[1:37:43] what about a god that knew when it was
[1:37:44] going to happen yet he was still happy
[1:37:47] the day that you got born again
[1:37:49] oh what much you can't do nothing else
[1:37:52] but worship him and serve him
[1:37:56] your spiritual gene had to be in god
[1:37:58] because you're an expression of the
[1:37:59] attribute of his thought
[1:38:01] you were a spoken word child
[1:38:08] right no way around it that's right
[1:38:11] now now we notice then
[1:38:14] that life being in you god's life being
[1:38:17] in you
[1:38:18] from the foundation of the world
[1:38:23] but something had to happen let's go to
[1:38:25] the next the scripture we've been
[1:38:26] reading let's read it one more time
[1:38:28] psalm 139 my substance was not hid from
[1:38:31] me
[1:38:32] when i was made in secret and curiously
[1:38:34] wrought in the lowest parts of the earth
[1:38:36] you know job looked one day and he said
[1:38:38] oh that i my name would be written in a
[1:38:39] book
[1:38:41] or that i could see what was going to
[1:38:43] happen
[1:38:44] thine eyes did see my substance
[1:38:47] yet being imperfect for all those years
[1:38:49] that we walked in sin and all the
[1:38:51] different things
[1:38:52] but yet daddy was standing there that
[1:38:53] day ready for a child to be born
[1:38:56] knowing you would come to a place
[1:38:58] knowing you would come to a place
[1:38:59] knowing you all would come to a place
[1:39:02] and in thy book all my members were
[1:39:05] written
[1:39:06] which in continuance in other words one
[1:39:08] right after the other
[1:39:09] we're fashioned one is yet there was
[1:39:12] none of them
[1:39:18] he had to wait what a patient god
[1:39:23] but when he waited he wasn't
[1:39:26] listen god's never gonna god's never
[1:39:29] gonna ask you
[1:39:31] why did it take you so long to get born
[1:39:32] again he knew exactly how long it would
[1:39:34] take
[1:39:35] but he was so patient that he would
[1:39:37] patiently wait on everyone in
[1:39:39] continuance
[1:39:40] knowing we were born in sin knowing what
[1:39:42] we would do
[1:39:44] listen that's the same way as the
[1:39:45] children of israel
[1:39:47] i mean you can see justification and
[1:39:49] sanctification baptism holy ghost right
[1:39:50] there through the children of israel
[1:39:52] children of israel what chosen of god
[1:39:55] amen
[1:39:57] he knew though 40 years later there's
[1:40:00] only two of them going to go in
[1:40:02] yet he babied them right through
[1:40:04] justification what stood at the water
[1:40:07] put that stick down
[1:40:11] two million people walked across on dry
[1:40:13] ground
[1:40:14] and he looked and what did he say he
[1:40:16] turned around and he said those
[1:40:17] egyptians
[1:40:19] you see today those sins
[1:40:23] that you see today you'll see them no
[1:40:26] more
[1:40:28] justification and then sanctification is
[1:40:32] kind of
[1:40:32] it's kind of interesting how they went
[1:40:33] through the wilderness of what
[1:40:36] sin but you watching what they were
[1:40:39] doing though god was getting them ready
[1:40:41] knowing only two was going to make it
[1:40:43] plus the little ones now i'm talking
[1:40:44] about but the original group
[1:40:46] he knew what they would do yet he would
[1:40:48] continually tell him
[1:40:49] when you get in the promised land now
[1:40:51] see that's you in sanctification because
[1:40:52] he knows
[1:40:53] who's going to make it and who's not so
[1:40:55] he's going to take you through this
[1:40:56] journey and he's going to
[1:40:57] you're going to cry for water one day
[1:40:59] and you're going to cry for this one day
[1:41:00] and you're going to cry for this one day
[1:41:02] you're going to loathe that bread this
[1:41:05] my goodness i'd love to have it it
[1:41:07] tastes like it tastes like honey
[1:41:10] come down all you had to do is go pick
[1:41:11] it up
[1:41:13] no money involved but yet god just
[1:41:16] didn't
[1:41:17] he said i know they all gonna die he
[1:41:19] said but i'm gonna baby him
[1:41:21] right through sanctification and that's
[1:41:23] what the unclean spirit goes out what
[1:41:24] was he doing he was driving out all them
[1:41:26] unclean people
[1:41:27] that wasn't gonna make it to the
[1:41:28] promised land but then they walked up to
[1:41:31] the promised land
[1:41:32] and what did what did uh caleb and
[1:41:34] joshua and caleb caleb stood there and
[1:41:36] he said give me my mountain
[1:41:38] he said i'm more able now than i was 40
[1:41:41] years ago
[1:41:42] and jay and joshua and caleb
[1:41:45] took all the young ones and they went
[1:41:48] into the promised land
[1:41:50] atop of the baptism of holy ghost but
[1:41:52] remember what happened as soon as they
[1:41:53] got there
[1:41:54] they had to fight their way for every
[1:41:57] piece of ground every devil was still
[1:42:00] over there in the promised land oh
[1:42:02] brother wade yeah the devil's still here
[1:42:05] let's stand to our feet
[1:42:07] but if you can't see that in the
[1:42:09] children of israel man god just
[1:42:11] through the whole wilderness of sin you
[1:42:12] know because remember in sanctification
[1:42:14] you're not born again
[1:42:16] you have sin you go through all these
[1:42:18] different things but god is
[1:42:19] what he's he's driving out the unclean
[1:42:21] spirit
[1:42:23] he was driving out all that stuff he
[1:42:24] said don't go after other gods don't
[1:42:26] marry other people
[1:42:27] stay away from the hittites and the
[1:42:29] highways stay away from all these
[1:42:30] websites and all these other different
[1:42:32] all these other ites
[1:42:34] that's your sanctification that's your
[1:42:36] journey
[1:42:38] but he knows who's going to make it who
[1:42:40] doesn't
[1:42:43] you got to choose whether it's you or
[1:42:45] not right
[1:42:46] let's sing us all god bless you
[1:42:51] let's worship him just for a minute
[1:43:00] 403. sorry 403.

[1:43:07] baptized
