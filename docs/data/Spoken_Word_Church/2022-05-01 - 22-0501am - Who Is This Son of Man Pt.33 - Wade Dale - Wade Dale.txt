3 STAGES OF ADOPTION
FIRST STAGE – THE BIRTH

ROMANS 8:14-17
»     14     †     For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. 
»     15     †     For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. 
»     16     †     The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: 
»     17     †      ¶  And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. 

-JUSTIFICATION
-SANCTIFICATION
-BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST

EPHESIANS 1:10-14
»     10     †     That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him: 
»     11     †     In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will: 
»     12     †     That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ. 
»     13     †     In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, 
»     14     †     Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.

I CORINTHIANS 3:1-3
»     1     †      ¶  And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. 
»     2     †     I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able. 
»     3     †     For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?

I PETER 2:1-...

question has been answered how great is our god we have the devil's answer we are the bride of jesus christ we are not to be knocked down drug around but just tell him how great your god is because you know satan had a choice he chose the wrong way he wanted to be god but he make god made us god that makes the difference he made satan his right hand man but that's not what he wanted he wanted somebody that would know how to worship him know how to praise him and when you're saying how great is our god you answer that question the world can't answer that question but you answer that question how great is that god how great is your god amen it's one you've got to take home with you how great is your god the world has a god the prophet of god said is the god of this evil age and

turn to the book of john i was thinking i heard a song this weekend i was talking about jehovah rafa and i know sister um um i can't remember rachel canada's name sister rachel canada always she would sing that song about the the seven compound names of jehovah and it would be nice if we could get her to do that again oh michael you're too big i can't see you it would be nice to get you to do that again but jehovah rapha we've been talking about healing healing and comfort that's what jehovah raphae is is healing not just healing healing and comfort god is the most comfortable person you'll ever need to be around amen like i've always said i want the devil to be uncomfortable but i want god to be comfortable in my house as we were as we were singing so god bless you we're going to get into this subject again with who is it son of man part 33 preacher called me the other day or we talked to him the other day and uh and he said uh he said you're on part 30. that's well told i was looking online last night brother donnie's on on uh number 253 of the church so get off of that i hope he's watching not brother donnie but the other guy part 33 is not bad i'm just slow amen and and the bride says okay but it's for your benefit not for mine it's for your benefit it's your benefit i know where i'm going with this it's like dad says i know where i'm going i'm just trying to get everybody to catch up to where we're to where we're going to and we all need to get there together amen leave nobody behind john one verse one let's bow our heads sorry to make keep you standing the heavenly father thank you for this day that you give us we ask you lord that you would just for a little time lord use this vessel lord to speak to your people and father give us revelation more than anything lord because that's what we need that's what we thrive off of lord the things of the world are the things of the world but lord your revelation when you come lord and give us that it is a power that the world will never understand is to get a revelation from the almighty so today i pray that you give us that revelation lord be with the ones that are saved truly lord be jehovah rapha today lord you're the healer you're the one that comforts us lord in time of need and father i pray that you would bless us now and take care of the service be with the ones that are sick here and the ones that are at home lord the ones that are traveling thank you lord for giving them all travel and mercies to get to the where they're going and to get back and i pray they should be with us in the furtherment of this service in jesus name we pray amen john 1 1 in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh verse 14 and dwelt among us now remember that's not that's not we know that that word was made flesh we know the son of man came on earth but the question is who is this son of man well now he's already gone he's already in another dispensation called the son of god he's not in the son of man dispensation unless we are in the son of man dispensation everybody with me all right so as we come into the son of man dispensation then the word was made flesh where in you and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we behold his glory the glory the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated let's give brother anderson and them a hand clap back in the back look at all this different they're trying to make it where you can see it see it better they're trying to get it to where we can be a little more active with our um in our sermons and our songs and it really it really um thrills my heart to hear you sing even a new song cause usually when we sing a new song it's real quiet because you mumble the words how many of us have mumbled through the verses we mostly know the course but we remember them through the verses well you we need to sing them saying the verses but now we got to where we can so we just appreciate brother dale for allowing us to do that amen and giving us the opportunity and then god give us the opportunity to put every all these brothers together to be able to help and because we sure couldn't do it ourself amen we love all of you with the love of the lord so now let's go to romans 8 verse 18 and today we're going to talk i'm going to kind of piggyback on what brother aaron wednesday night that was a good one that was a good one they're all good but you know what you can have a good meal and then you have a great meal it's all food but you can go back and say i want that great meal again well i'm going to kind of piggyback on what he was um bringing wednesday and and i thank god for brother bob for doing that for doing this charter fiction to see here just a minute and kind of break it down for us and and kind of back up just a minute instead of rushing up the statue of perfect man let's kind of back up just a little bit and let's start at the foundation so romans 8 verse 18 says for i reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed where in us so whatever is going to happen you're going to have to make it happen and god has predestinated a group that will do that plug yourself in plug yourself into that i like what brother ernie always said he said when you get born again you're plugged into the eternal you know a light doesn't do you any good let's plugged in a refrigerator doesn't do you any gun unless it's plugged in to the right outlet so i believe we're we're the right we're the right instrument and we got the right outlet so let's plug ourselves in today amen for the earnest expectation of the creature creation this whole world is waiting for the manifestation of us let's not say another age or all christendom it's not going to happen not going to happen only the predestinated to adoption is what is going to happen to you man is everybody okay with that all right so let's go to quote number one we've read it before we'll read it again but i like this because look we always talk about faith and we're going to talk about faith today at the bottom of the pyramid we always talk about having more faith how brotherhood how can i have more faith well brother brown said read the bible and pray that's one thing to do but also it tells you real plain right here teaching places a man positionally what he is and we we the bride can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are now that's a faith that goes beyond the new birth [Music] have faith and be born again but does that end your journey no it just starts your journey so you've got to have add to your faith faith is the substance of things hoped for what something's pulling us up that statue of a perfect man it's taking us to a place and i told you the other day you know you look at those people over in israel and even the orthodox jew who thinks that god's coming that he's not already here all right they're doing this the whole time why because they say god is moving always and when they're talking to god they want to be moving all right so that's the same way with me and you some of you need to practice this if you'll do this more often you won't sleep in service now you might if you get your head down far enough don't hit the first person in front of you and please don't hit the bench because then we'll be praying for the sick again but just remember though you know what keep your mind working keep your mind working keep your mind working about god i i was watching brother donnie a couple of nights ago and he's preaching on the church and i wanted to kind of listen to what he was talking about he said you know what he said he's talking about his people he's you know what he said you grandparents he said you'll take your grandkids to a ball game and make them play they don't want to be there they don't even want they standing out there and it's supposed to be batting left-handed they're right-handed they got a glove instead of a bat but you're out there going white come on man come on let's go and he gets up there and and you know johnny finally does get the bat right hand and he hits it and it goes two feet and he said now johnny doesn't look over at grandparents and they're going they're going whoa johnny go go johnny go he said that's what we ought to be doing doesn't matter if you hit the ball that far doesn't matter the preacher don't even hit the ball you ought to be alive you ought to be able to say sick them a good amen amen means so be it you know what you're doing when you say so be it it's according to you it's it's going back to you if we talk about healing you say amen then you know what it's coming back to you i don't know if you ever thought about that or not but you know it's a two-way street you know but let's get into he let's go to hebrews 6. we're all in hebrews brother bob and myself and i i really i love the book of hebrews so let's read hebrews 6 verse 1. therefore leaving the principles now so that's what we're gonna we're gonna talk about coming today is moving therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on into what perfection we're gonna see what that means because a lot of times we look at perfection and we think can't get there i got all this i got all that i got this baggage remember i told you put it in the seat of god's forgetfulness and quit fishing quit trying to fish it back up but we're going on to perfection which is completion and we'll read what the greek lexicon is going to say about perfection so let's not look at perfection as what you think perfection has been all your life the bible says be there for perfect we know that's complete but only in the bride in the end time can we be complete amen they are waiting on us they without us can't be made perfection but without us they're not but with us they can be perfect so it says let us go on into perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward god of the doctrine of baptism a laying on of hands resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment and this we will do if god permits all right with this we will do if god permits so let's go to first corinthians 13 verse 9 just kind of lay a foundation for this for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect perfect perfection same thing perfect it's come now we know jesus christ is the only perfect one but remember he had problems bob just read them bob just read the problems that he had he was tempted he was tried all these different things listen and we're going to talk about this a little later but i want you to see two words fall and fail they're not the same word by you getting up this morning and needing to eat and having the thoughts in your mind you have failed ah that amen is not coming from anywhere we all fail we fail god by having to eat to sustain our energy because it wasn't so in the garden we're gonna have to get up and go to work you know you know what you're not going to have to think about thoughts that we think of carnality during the week that's where we fail but i'm going to read you a scripture here maybe it'll be this afternoon where peter says if you get these virtues working in your life you'll never fall you can't fall if you're born again if you're born again you there is no way you can go past that what we're going to talk about today backwards you can fail but you can't fall amen we fail all the time so you say well brother what are you now you're talking about us failing and you're talking about us being perfect let's just hang on a minute but what the when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away now look not done away like we don't need that anymore that's your foundation that we're building on all right when i was a child i speak as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man hello somebody we have got to become men in god you can be an 18 year old man in god you can be a 15 year old man in god if you got the baptism of the holy ghost all right so man is not just age it's maturity i put away childish things hello i put away childish things and don't pick them back up all right the greek lexicon let's go to the next one now those two words mean of full age look brought to its end that's why the bible says they without us cannot be brought to an end he saw brother the end that's death death at the end what brother brown said the seventh seal was the end of all things not an end like falling off and here's the end of the cliff no it's just the beginning of something else it's bringing us to completion of perfection and we add this and we add that and we add virtual knowledge temperance we'll get to that in a little bit we got to stay down keep me down at the foundation here brought to its end finished wanting nothing necessary to completeness now you and i are in that position today you are not wanting for anything to complete your birth or to complete your journey in life you've been given the word of god you've been given the divine interpretation of the word of god the correct interpretation by the prophet of the hour and you've been given a five-fold ministry that knows what they're doing you gotta decide whether you're in the right place or not wanting nothing necessary to completeness perfect that which is perfect consummate human integrity and what virtue of men full grown adult of full age and mature so let's go to the next one i like this next one this is what perfection means go to the next greek lexicon let's go up there we go finisher it doesn't say perfect it says a perfecter someone that's going to perfect you you can't perfect yourself but when you come to this completeness of this fullness then you have a perfecter you have the holy ghost that comes inside of you and molds you vulcanizes so much you can't pull it apart and he's sitting there waiting on what your faith one who has in his own person raised faith to its perfection and so sent before us the highest example of faith listen the highest example of faith is when we take a body change that's the highest example of faith and the ones that are going to take a body change without death that's what we're looking at and that's what we need to be but everybody's not going to get there but get the new birth get the new birth that's your journey that's what that like i said before you it doesn't matter it does matter about these virtues but if you if you become a christian and god wants to work with you and and you just really you know got the wildly well as you would and i can't do this and i can't do that then you know what god's gonna say okay well that's fine he's a high priest of what your confession he goes off what you confess regardless it doesn't matter if you're having the worst day of your life confess that god is inside your soul and listen we'll get to in just a second but once you realize something to come to perfection like i said before we can fail but we can't fall once you get born again you can't fall like hebrew says fall away those people that fall away never got the new birth okay but but but let's go back on our side if you are sealed in then the confirmation that you got the new birth is you can look through your life and see virtue knowledge temper space of the godliness working in your life testimonies life where god does something in your life because you're his child and he's always going to help his child more than he helps the world so let's go to ephesians 4 11. we've read this many times before but we're going to read it again and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting are the bringing us to an end like i said before when i said a minute ago your end you thought death no you can't end the christian's life there's no way you can end the christian's life no more than you can in god's life sure he had a human body that had an end it died but guess what that same body sitting on the throne today interceding for us amen so ephesians 4 is for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ i don't see how in the world people think they can get edified any other way if i hurt your feelings i'm sorry but press and play is okay but it ain't gonna get you much full maturity four maturities gotta come through a five-fold ministry i didn't say it the bible did all right find the bible don't fight people listen we're not finding people find the bible if you want to fight somebody give it to the bible say here read this what do you say see law it's in the bible unto the measure until we all come into the unity of faith wow unity and of the knowledge of the son of god that's not knowledge human knowledge we'll talk about that when we get into the virtues a little bit later unto a perfect man there's that word again unto the measure of the stature stature not statue that's a statue god doesn't want a statue he won't stature height development growth he wants you to grow up that we henceforth be no more children now this is paul and and peter all these different ones are trying to say look you need to be more mature you need more we all need to be more mature now if he's saying that back in the first church age what about the seventh church age when we are what predestinated unto adoption and you've got to come to this before you can come to adoption you got to come to a stature or growth development we'll talk about that in a minute that we henceforth be no more children toss to and fro i'll read a quote here in just a minute brother brian says you know you got you need to quit stop going from church to church running around find you a good place and stay there i'm not telling you that brother brown told you that because you can't be settled we can't be wandering stars wondering whether this is right and wondering whether that's right and carried about with every wind of doctrine there we go again every wind of doctrine like brother aaron was talking about man i'm telling you i like that where the bible says considering the end of your conversation amen like i said before there was there was a preacher years and years ago that preached a memorial service or yeah memorial day service for brother homer and he preached the best sermon on the millennium i have heard in my life until today until you know till now things that he brought out and the little intricacies and the little things that he brought out two months later he was put in jail for sleeping with a 14 year old girl and now i think he's back preaching again that ain't failing that's fallen okay we all fail but you see what i'm saying when you get the anointing on somebody it's the true anointing of god and he can preach his heart out and be an anointed one but to put the word together and just keep going it's like brother brown said he wants time-tested christians he wants somebody that the time has tested us listen you and i look way different than we did 20 years ago because time has tested us we have we have things that are used to not be there and things in places that never used to be amen but that's time-tested humans now what about time-tested christians you need to be not babies anymore we need to grow up that's right but look what they do though they slide of men in cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love what may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ and he's the church he's the head of the church right he's building his body he is the head he doesn't need a head that's right he is the head he is the husband he is not looking for another groom he knows who he wants all right i mean another bride he is the groom and you're the bride that's it there's no you know as brother brown said many times there's been bribes brides churches brides but he had to put them all away he had to put him all away until he got the right one and he we are the right one because we are the ones called to perfection amen from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted i like that word compacted it's not just loosely fit it's compacted because on that statue of perfect man when you see this holy spirit right here we'll see it on turtle you see this right here that's not getting the baptism of the holy ghost we know that but that is sealing or compacting all these inside of you and then he's able to use you by adoption he's be he's able to watch say here here's the keys here his here's my word you speak it and i'll back it up then the word goes to speaking everybody all right according to the effectual working if effectual we got to work all right in the measure of every part make us increase of the body into the edifying of itself and what's that very top one up there it is love that is love the stature of the fullness of christ but you gotta you gotta start somewhere let's look at the greek lexicon on the next one excuse me and let's see what that means stature of the fullness of christ that's age adult age maturity look suitable age for anything it didn't say just certain things suitable aids for anything metaphorically of an attained state fit for a thing in other words you're going to attain a certain thing you're going to attain to virtue knowledge temperance patience that's what our god has given us uh it's kind of strange how brother branham preached the god the night he preached that you're a perfect man in the daytime because we needed that guide i don't i don't see how in the world that that people think that we have to go all the way up here to get the holy ghost i'll prove it in just a few minutes there's no way for you to know who these what these virtues are unless you've got the holy ghost the bible says you can't even call jesus to christ without having the holy ghost so i don't know how in the world if you can't call jesus to christ which these are all his attributes how in the world are we going to be able to do that no you get the car before the horse hey man cow eating grass in the top of the tree you got the cow right you got the grass right but he's in the wrong place amen so let's watch what we're doing all right so let's pull that chart the first chart is going to be everything this is the one that bob did that he pulled up this morning we're going to pull it up and just kind of give an overview and then we're going to break it apart all right so they'll get it look watch how they fade that out and watch that feeder up again there we go but now this is the chart brother brown and drew faith versus knowledge temperatures godless brother kindness and the capstone is love and then we just broke this apart as bob did and then i'm just stealing it from him so then he did something else for me because look as we see this this is this is the this is to me if you look at this chart you will see a body change you will see the son of man being walking and breathing and talking again in human beings the headstone has come the seals has been opened to you we know they're open in 63 but they got to open to you individually to see the plan of redemption the full plan not just this plan here right not just this plan here but we are supposed to come to the headstone that is our mandate for today is to let god be preeminent in our life and in our flesh amen he's preeminent in our soul down here everybody with me say amen he's preeminent in our soul old nature's gone we'll talk about in just a second but then we got a what look at this little baby right here see the little shadow you're a little baby but then you got to grow up more then grow up more i mean man look at your own life your own life proves that there's a statue of a perfect man brother branham just brought everything together to show us exactly what was going on and then we got we're listen you're not a son and daughter of god until you're born again everybody all right with that you're not can y'all see that i'll step over here you can't be a son and daughter of god until you're born again but once you get born again you are son and daughter of god we'll read it in just a minute in in romans but then you are a son of god well now that son of god is what that's as we were typing through the church ages and the different things we see this ministry coming up and it's coming up to what is more narrow more narrow more narrow until it comes to the holy spirit that wells everything together and then god according to luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 the different ones that son of man's got to come back and it's not that person in his flesh it's his person in your flesh amen because his body can't be on earth and him have a bride on earth at the same time he'd have two he'd have two brides two bodies can't have two bodies but he told us in john saint john 17 he said lord i pray that they be one that like we are one so when his hand moved god's hand moved when your hand moves god hands move oh brother wait that don't see we'll go back again there's the failures but i believe the one inside of me is perfect and when he tells me to move that hand it's perfection sometimes you can't swallow that but you better start learning how to eat so you can't swallow hey man let that mother eagle chew it up a little bit and and come on wednesday and come on sunday and come on sunday again and and come on bible study and you just keep eating and guess what's gonna happen you're gonna get fed amen all right so look so may grow up in all things adult full age maturity suitable age for anything so now let's look at first corinthians take that back off and we'll put the other chart up in just a second so let's go to first corinthians 14 verse 19. i love scripture i haven't i usually read a lot of quotes i haven't read many quotes i just read scripture because listen scripture if you look at scripture we see the divine interpretation the brother brown gives us the divine interpretation of the scripture right but now remember then he goes off the scene and that in the divine interpreter or perfecter is now in you it's not one man standing behind the pulpit that has the perfect word of god he's gone done his job and gone off the scene now he's in a five-fold ministry the professor is now speaking through a five-fold ministry that should be more mature than they were ten years ago two years ago or six months ago all right now look yet in the church i'd rather speak five words like brother bob was talking about i you know i ain't gonna say it never mind it's just become a dance show now bob knows what i'm doing it's become a dance show go online and look at some of these places some of these camps and stuff it's become a dance show i'm sorry pretending to dance to god is wrong dancing in the spirit is a whole different thing amen and you can tell the difference someone told me a long time ago he said he said you know i remember when my mama and my daddy used to he's out he's not he's out in the world he's a deer hunting friend of mine he said my mom and daddy used to run the benches and said one time mama fell and broke her leg i said well you know me i said well that wasn't god that was your mama that's right because god ain't gonna let that happen if it's god and man you walk on coals of fire but let me tell you something you better be careful make sure it's god just say it yet in the church i'd rather speak five words with my understanding amen this is paul that by my voice i might teach others also than ten thousand words in an unknown language not just ten words paul not just a thousand ten thousand words in an unknown language let me speak five words of understanding brethren be not children in understanding how being in malice be your children but in understanding be men wow and the law it is written with men of other tongues and other lips while i speak into his people and yet for all that will they not hear me you hear what that is and the law it's written with men of other tongues and other lips well i speaking to the people he says okay but hang on a minute and yet all that will not hear me they're not going to all hear me they're just going to all start shouting and speaking in tongues wherefore tongues are for a sign look not to them that believe i'm sorry i'm reading the bible everybody believe the bible's right okay all right just want to make sure we had a good congregation here today what brother brown say i'm in the right one now there's believers here wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe but to them that believe not but prophecy prophecy service not for them that believe not but for them which believe today we're hearing prophecy and prophecy is being made manifest paul is prophesying of a group of people to come we're the people peter prophesying of add to your faith you'll never fall if you do these things but he the lack of these things is blind and can't see it far off in other words can't see revelation everybody with me today now let's go to quote number two and it'll tie every business together now remember i said look prophesying servants not for them that believeth not but for them which believe the revelation of jesus christ in the church age book we still believe in that book amen you'll recall that i mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying is the actual revelation of jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages that's here then i mentioned that it takes the holy spirit the holy spirit not the one up there down here that to begin with then it takes you up to there then i mentioned that it takes the holy spirit to give us revelation or we will what fail to get it everybody with me now listen bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study right god's son of prophet believe one lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved paul said leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go into perfection bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it is going to take the operation of the holy ghost come on everybody do this because some of y'all falling asleep give me right put your hands together do this you're not doing it to me you're doing it to god you need to say god keep me awake it will require supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse with verse i like that's like me that's like me and albert einstein okie dokie me trying to explain the theory of relativity to him i believe you missed it my son so it's not a student comparing verse with verse though that is good though that's okay but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear can't see blind it never becomes clear let's read number three is this a sign of the answer um get ready to pull that chart up brother the first one i mean the second one the mysteries here is the mystery i read this last weekend a mystery is scripture all right hello a mystery of scripture scripture is written with different layers to it everybody with me brother brown says compound meaning dual meaning okay a mystery of scripture is a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed but which a supernatural element still remains despite the revelation all right here's what we're going to do you see this right here we see that all even even all of christendom from paul's age of peter's age and all down all the way up to where i'm standing today the bible says believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved he tells nicodemus he said ye must be born again that's not god away from that it's not got away from that but man has put his own interpretation to it and got away from it god didn't get away from it but see they believe on the lord jesus christ as a second person i'm going to take this water baptism in matthew versus the one in acts because this is what jesus said i thought he wrote the whole thing right i thought he wrote all of it is he that confused he's really confused because you know what he's done on top of that he gave the man that said that in the book of acts the king of the kingdom peter no no no don't say that no when it clicked on earth it had to click in heaven but man's theology their knowledge not the knowledge of the of that knowledge but the knowledge of man has interpreted and and deluded the word of god down through the church ages even good people you know luther was a trinitarian but god's never been a trinitarian the holy ghost has never been see that to me is a paradox the holy ghost has never been a trinitarian but he was inside of luther and luther was a trinitarian because you know what man's thoughts got involved memory reason conscious affection imagination and it wasn't time for him to get it he saw what he could see and that was it all right everybody with me remember let's be not children let's say we listen even brother brown some in another quote he says we are prophetic people with prophetic insight this prophetic insight has done what it has opened this new world to know there's a dispensation of the son of god as dispensation of the son of man a dispensation of the son of david and thank god he sent a prophet everybody believed god sent a prophet okay that was kind of weak but that's okay we'll get through them but there's a supernatural element besides the revelation listen when god revealed itself to you to get the new birth this is to get the new birth all right when he come to you and said be my child all right that's a layer that's god fulfilling this promise acts 2 38 all right you go be baptized the name of jesus christ for remission and sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and you can receive the holy ghost without being baptized but you won't receive the holy ghost and not be baptized the correct way in this end time all right that make it that right all right okay but the supernatural element is is that i mean you know and and i hate it in most realms when you say perfection talk to somebody really nail it down to even just a good baptist or a good pentecostal say god told us to be perfect he told us to be perfect be there for perfect first thing out of their mouth you ain't perfect now ain't perfect you got problems and i got problems you got this and you got that you got this the problem is hearing hearing lies the problem is like brother brown said in marriage and divorce it's misinterpreted theology because the baptist is like one saved always saved so if you ever get saved one time it doesn't matter what you do afterwards pentecostal said oh just come on make sure you make sure you remember speak in tongues you got the holy ghost now how many wives you got will you talk to you at the liquor store you understand what i'm saying i'm saying not talk to you but talk to people [Music] but the supernatural element is to me and you because we're prophetic people the seals have been open and we have been required not to just see them but to walk in them we've been required to be them we we we're required to not just read the word but be the word that is our requirement our mandate is to be prophetic people knowing that god listen even even if you suppress the holy ghost all right and you can because remember you can grieve him he's still sitting there going if you'll open that door i'll walk through it the doorknob's on your side buddy the doorknob's on your side i can't do nothing but knock i can't do anything but take a five-fold ministry and knock at your door please let me in but you know what he's not gonna do he's not gonna knock that door down he's a timid god he's a good god but he's just you don't get in on your goodness i promise you that all right let's go to the chart number two this is how we're gonna break it apart brother bob helped me with this or he didn't help me he actually did it so now if you can't see that come on up toward the front some of us that are a little bit older yeah i see that but this just begins your journey piggybacking off of what brother aaron was talking about this begins your journey you cannot have a journey with god without being justified sanctified and filled with the holy ghost no way because you are born in sin shaping an iniquity you are contrary to god just like i said before listen you were born contrary to god so i don't know what all this you know we were this great something listen we were great in god's mind but when god's mind listen god's mind got sealed when adam and eve couldn't produce a son or daughter of god god sealed that up in his mind and said i'm going to bring them but i got to bring them a different way to be a healer to be a savior to be a redeemer i've got to let him make a choice and he knew their choice would be to get lost and the womb of her mind and then her body was so polluted he could not use it anymore everybody with me to me that's a simple plan of redemption but we were always in the mind of god waiting for our time to come through sex through brother brown said take this one and breathe to this one and bring this one how'd y'all get here it's a mystery how you got here i'm talking about here in this building it's a mystery boy it's a mystery had to come through some things had to come a little different way but it's a testimony it's a life that brings you what right here to a foundation of faith believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved let's read this one more i kind of got a little ahead of myself so let's go to ephesians 1 verse 10 but leave that up there and put it up over here if you don't mind man we got all kind of cameras and stuff going on around here that's good yeah i'll put the scripture up over there and leave that over there because we got to go through justification sanctification baptism the holy ghost before god will start even using you everybody with me now now sanctification is is cleaned and set aside for service but the prophet of god said not in service he can't trust you with the keys to the car everybody with me all right that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him and him also we have obtained an inheritance all right what's your inheritance eternal life all right let's just stay let's just stay you all know my hold on stay down here your inheritance is eternal life your inheritance is not what you get from your mom and dad down here your inheritance is what you get from your father in heaven it's an eternal inheritance it's one that won't go away everybody with me being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ in whom you also trusted look after after not after up here after right here after you heard the word of truth the gospel of what your salvation in whom also after that she believed oh brother wait i always was this and it just you know i heard preachers say the other day it just it just come alive well that's okay that's fine but why didn't it come alive before because you had to hear the word you had to physically hear the word of god you had to hear god calling your name from the mind of god he's calling your name knowing that you were going to come to this place and be sick and tired of being sick and tired amen done with this stuff i'm here lord and that happened to me i know what happened to y'all after that you believed after that you believe you got to believe in something oh this listen this up here is not believing at first you don't even know what virtue is you don't even know what knowledge and temperance is without having to hold the ghost but look after that you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise sealed with that holy spirit of promise like i said before if you're if you're filled with the whole if you have a new birth right here you can't fall any further back all right you're a christian you don't have to go through the tribulation you don't have to stand to watch on judgment you get a free ticket cause you accepted him right here not up there at the top everybody got me your journey begins right here now listen then brother brown says your eternal destination begins at the altar do you know what he said begins at the altar where right here god knows where you're going to be on up this way but your eternal life begins what begins begins the journey begins the journey listen before you were born again you didn't know how to do this you didn't care i'm sorry you almost went somewhere i didn't some of y'all no i didn't care i care about god i'll be honest with you i knew of a god i knew that he was doing good for mom and dad and different ones but me i didn't care he was the furthest away from my thoughts at one time amen let's just come listen this is one big confessional booth today hey if we don't get it right we can't i start somebody one time i said look if you start something wrong you can't make it right five years down the road you got to make it you got to go back to the foundation and make it right with anything that you do if you start it wrong it's like brother branham most of you know about hunting you start right here and you have to line those sights up if you're you might be it from here to that wall you might be off just maybe maybe a quarter of an inch but that bullet will never as he get further and shoot further and further away that bullet never comes back to where it's supposed to unless you come back here and adjust it go back to the table to the bench that you're shooting on you gotta adjust it that quarter of an inch because a quarter of an inch at this distance from here to that lady's house or the neighbor's house up there you might be off this far if you're 100 yards you may be so far off you you're hitting you're hitting the neighbor's cow instead of hitting the target but remember that bullet never never comes back you have to come back here you have to come back here and get it right to start with amen focus that thing in right get it right together and put the front sight with the backside and then shoot the bullet which is the earnest see you're sealed right here and what is an earnest it's your down payment if you're born again the day you got born again you got a down payment on the possession of the whole house but you've got seven payments to make one two three four five six seven you got seven payments to make to get to your payoff of the home or your body change i think some of y'all more excited about your home mortgage being paid off than your body change it would help but that's temporal this is eternal now look let's go to first corinthians 3 verse 1 and read it and paul admonishing the corinthians again and i brethren could not speak unto you as into spiritual but as into carnal so he comes to the corinthians he sees them doing all kind of things that that the ephesian church is not doing but you know what paul didn't say y'all bunch of bastards bastard children get out of here no he finds out there's fornicators there's whoremongers read corinthians right a boy living with a stepmom in the church and he goes on over in corinthians he said such for some of you but you are washed but you are sanctified we'll read that maybe later on my brethren could not speak unto you as into spiritual but as a carnal even as an even as unto babes in christ i have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto you were not able to bear it neither yet now are you able that's a question you need to ask yourself for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying strife division are you not carnal and walk as men he's asking the corinthians this is his church this is not the corinthians that's running around outside this is the people that paul is preaching to his congregation i couldn't speak to u.s spirits in other words he goes to the ephesian church and he speaks to them about predestination and about all these different things and and how they're like praise god and then he comes over to corinthians and and he sees this and he says y'all babies a bunch of babies but i'm going to take you babies though and i'm going to teach you because he goes back to corinthians strict corinth three times you all know that he went the car in three times so you know what paul didn't first time he didn't say all right i'm done with you i'm out of here no he goes back again he goes back again and he goes back again you know why because he sees some seed there he sees he sees it working but it's not coming you know the seeds laying in there we know that but it's the word that they heard misinterpreted theology is what got us all in trouble so it got the corinthians in trouble they were believing i think they were kind of uh heathens anyway believing in no god or anything like that so paul brings him a message like we're trying to do today we're trying to bring a message and break it down to where you can see this so the chart here we're going to start here real quick and then we'll close and start back this afternoon excuse me let's go to first peter 2 verse 1. wherefore laying aside all ballasts and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speaking as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby thereby if so be you have what if so be that you have tasted that the lord is gracious that's your new birth to whom coming as into a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of god and precious how about you ye also as lively stones are built up a built up amen he didn't know what to call it you said oh that way bro no he did not know what to call it paul did not know how how to call it the stature of a perfect man but he's preaching it to whom coming as into a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of god and precious no that's jesus christ then he also as living stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices that's what we're going to talk about this afternoon the spiritual sacrifices is right here spiritual sacrifices you don't get spiritual nothing until you get the new birth everybody with me everybody okay he also has lit lively stones or built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer us spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold i land zion a chief cornerstone that's what we're going to talk about this afternoon but i want you to look at this right here chief cornerstone where's the cornerstone foundation foundation stone little bitty pyramid right here a little bit of pyramid over there but it's gonna grow into a big pyramid grow into a big pyramid everybody with me but what is it doing though wherefore also is contained in the scripture behold i land on the chief cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be what confounded confused unto ye therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient you can be disobedient and not get these virtues think about it everybody with me until you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed what the foundation the same has made the head of the corner god's going to have a church he's just going to build it and he's going to go to the top and a stone of stumbling to some a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word he made it pretty plain they stumbled at the word being disobedient where unto also they were appointed let's go to first peter one and then we'll get ready for the musicians to come second peter 1 verse 1 simon peter a servant apostle of jesus christ to them that have what obtained and i just woke up one day and i got it obtained like precious faith with us was peter born again somebody answered was peter born again day of pentecost holy ghost fell in 120 peter was there so he's got the new birth so now to them that have obtained light precious faith with us through the righteousness of god in our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power satan does not have divine power you as a human mortal does not have divine power there's only one man divine and only one person and only one thing divine and that's god jesus christ is the only divine person there is but where is he today what what you say brother hey where in you surprise oh you two oh surprise well that's the only two in the building everybody else is just looking at me according has his divine power had given unto us so now he's giving us something given unto us all things that pertaineth unto life and godliness even how to run your life your human mortal life godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us what exceeding great and precious promises that by what the prophet said by these promises you might be partakers when you go sit down and eat do you look at your food no you partake especially if it's good you partake all right that you might be partakers of the divine nature not just look at it not just see it not just hope you're part of it having escaped the corruption that is in the world true lust that's your born-again experience that's this right here that we're going to start on this afternoon this right here is where you start your christian journey it plugs you into god it plugs you into the almighty and unplugs you from the world now i know the world is going to be around you and inside that memories and conscious effects of imagination satan is going to play that is his playground right but if you're born again in your soul you are not just like god you are god you're not just almost perfect it has already been perfected just let it out somebody ought to say that i've only said it like 50 times since january but look are we done i'm born again give me a cot give me a nice warm baby give me toby my little doggie i'm done i'm a christian you know what
