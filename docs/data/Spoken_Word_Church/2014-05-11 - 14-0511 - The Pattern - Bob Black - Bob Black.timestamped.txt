[0:15] like a little a little thing that
[0:18] do we have in here
[0:23] it's on that camera
[0:24] somewhere yeah
[0:26] you can't say it though yeah i guess
[0:28] that's nice
[0:45] all right so
[0:47] let's turn back to exodus 25
[0:51] and read the first nine verses again
[0:54] and we're gonna finish on verse nine and
[0:56] then we're gonna go over to colossians
[0:58] 1 26
[1:00] and 27
[1:02] but before we do that let's go to the
[1:04] lord and pray real quick
[1:07] lord god we thank you god for your grace
[1:09] to us
[1:10] we thank you most of all for the truth
[1:12] lord jesus that you've given it to us
[1:14] because lord we know that this is how we
[1:16] become into the stature of a perfect man
[1:21] god i pray that she'll be with us today
[1:23] lord open our hearts to hear your word
[1:26] and god grant the lord it's going to
[1:28] remember the services today and remember
[1:30] us all the ones that couldn't be here
[1:31] today lord jesus
[1:33] yeah touch the ones that are needful
[1:34] lord we ask in the name of the lord
[1:36] jesus christ
[1:49] a little bit more i'm kidding
[1:57] all right exodus 25
[2:00] verse 1
[2:02] and the lord spake unto moses saying
[2:04] speak unto the children of israel that
[2:05] they bring me an offering of every man
[2:07] that giveth it willingly with his heart
[2:09] he shall take my offering
[2:11] you know all the children of israel had
[2:12] to bring their offering willfully right
[2:16] and that's
[2:17] if i could stress anything in this
[2:19] little lesson this morning that would be
[2:22] to offer up your own ideas
[2:25] so that god can deliver you of you
[2:27] because that's what hinders us all is
[2:28] our own ideas
[2:30] our own when we when we come and we'll
[2:33] we prefer to take our own ideas instead
[2:35] of god's word right then that is what
[2:38] henry just said more than
[2:40] not now what i'm what i'm about to say
[2:42] uh if you would like the proof of it
[2:45] then i would like to refer you to read
[2:47] hebrews 5
[2:48] and hebrews 9
[2:50] and the message brought around priests
[2:51] in 1963 look
[2:53] which is uh
[2:56] he says things and that sermon is way
[2:58] more profound maybe than than what i'll
[3:01] get into now but that that sermon is
[3:04] just
[3:05] just listen to that sermon and think
[3:07] about what i'm about to speak on
[3:10] so they brought the
[3:13] the things to build the tabernacle
[3:16] willingly
[3:17] but not holding back not like ananiasis
[3:20] fire that they uh
[3:22] made like a show that they were they
[3:24] were real christians and and uh put on
[3:27] some kind of public show
[3:30] where in private they were withholding
[3:32] things but they gave willfully that
[3:34] god's plan and purpose could be brought
[3:37] to pass
[3:39] and this is the offering which he shall
[3:41] take of them gold and silver and brass
[3:44] not just not just like a little
[3:48] cheap thing but he took the most prized
[3:50] possessions the best that they had to
[3:52] offer
[3:53] and this is the offer in which he shall
[3:55] take it in gold and silver and brass and
[3:57] blue and purple and scarlet and fine
[3:59] linen and goat's hair and ram skins dyed
[4:03] red and bad their skins that's your
[4:04] teamwood all for the life spices for
[4:07] anointing oil for sweet incense onyx
[4:09] stones and stones that you said in the
[4:10] ephod and in the breastplate
[4:13] look what i think is just so amazing
[4:15] they didn't know
[4:17] what was going to happen with all these
[4:19] things that they were giving but god had
[4:21] a plan and purpose that for every one of
[4:24] these things that the onyx stones the
[4:26] things that would be make up the
[4:28] breastplate
[4:29] everything had a predestinated plan and
[4:31] purpose that everything went right into
[4:34] even though they didn't realize it and i
[4:36] i think that
[4:37] in the message look brother brown talks
[4:39] about how we should be prayerful that we
[4:41] can see god's plan and purpose and align
[4:44] ourselves because in our own in our own
[4:47] carnal mind you how how are we supposed
[4:49] to know uh
[4:52] how do you know who to marry who which
[4:54] church to go to what where to move what
[4:56] different things in your life that god
[4:59] can direct you and move you we sh that
[5:02] we should be spirit led or spirit land
[5:04] people
[5:05] because the little things in your life
[5:09] as god moves you down life's path you
[5:11] may not realize how things are gonna
[5:12] line up
[5:14] and he said and then let them and let
[5:16] them make me a sanctuary that i may
[5:18] dwell among them
[5:20] according to all now that's a scripture
[5:22] to remember that i may dwell among them
[5:24] according to all that i shall show thee
[5:27] that according to all that i show thee
[5:29] after the pattern of the tabernacle and
[5:32] the pattern of all the instruments
[5:33] thereof
[5:35] even so shall you make it
[5:37] now that's what i want to talk about
[5:38] this morning
[5:39] the pattern of the tabernacle
[5:42] because i believe that god showed that
[5:45] god took moses up into the mountain red
[5:47] where he took him up into the mouth and
[5:50] with a cloud and and and uh
[5:53] it reminds you something else that there
[5:54] was a cloud that came on the mountain
[5:57] and the prophet of god was taken up
[6:00] and when he was up there god showed him
[6:03] the plan now we know brother branham was
[6:05] taken up by the angels and he didn't
[6:06] know the mysteries of the seven seals
[6:09] until he returned back
[6:11] but it followed the same kind of pattern
[6:13] he was taken up into the cloud taken up
[6:16] and here god showed moses the pattern
[6:20] and i believe the pattern that he showed
[6:21] moses was not just something like a
[6:23] scroll a piece of paper or something but
[6:25] he showed him a heavenly pattern of the
[6:28] completed what the completed tabernacle
[6:30] would look like
[6:32] it was already finished
[6:34] when moses saw it what he saw was
[6:38] and maybe just to create a little
[6:39] dramatization maybe moses could actually
[6:41] walk through it and observe because look
[6:43] at all the details
[6:45] that that moses came back with right he
[6:49] the details of every little thing of how
[6:52] the tabernacle should be constructed
[6:54] because they were all very important
[6:57] every little detail
[6:59] and if you look in the message look
[7:01] brother branham stress and just all
[7:03] through the message of how just one word
[7:05] off you get your own carnal idea right
[7:08] you start thinking well maybe this
[7:09] candlestick doesn't need to knock or
[7:12] maybe this uh this uh the euro thurman
[7:15] doesn't need as many uh little onyx
[7:18] stones or a little stump different kind
[7:20] of stone maybe we can lose this jasper
[7:22] stone out of it but it won't work
[7:24] because it's got to match god's plan and
[7:27] purpose it's got to match his pattern
[7:31] and you can see how that down uh
[7:34] you you can see how that uh
[7:37] god's reasonable plan and purpose is
[7:39] kind of revealed there in genesis 1 26
[7:41] 27 there was the pattern and that
[7:44] heavenly pattern was brought down to
[7:46] earth and adam walked out when that
[7:49] spirit man was put into a body and began
[7:52] to be made manifest and you can see how
[7:54] that god just looking at the pattern how
[7:57] the pattern was brought to earth that
[7:59] god is not a trinity like three
[8:01] different people because here comes the
[8:03] pattern made manifest and one man walks
[8:07] out this is matching the pattern
[8:10] god's not like
[8:11] you you can see you can see uh
[8:15] god
[8:16] as he makes himself manifest in in the
[8:19] earth to see the heavenly pattern you
[8:21] can see
[8:22] who god is and how he is by looking at
[8:25] how he make makes himself manifest
[8:28] and all down through scripture that the
[8:30] natural shows what's in the heavens in
[8:32] first john 5 7 8 for there are three
[8:34] that bear record in heaven the father
[8:36] the word and the holy the holy ghost and
[8:38] these 301 and there are three that bear
[8:40] witness in earth the spirit in the water
[8:42] and the blood and these three agree to
[8:44] one
[8:44] there's a heavenly and there's a natural
[8:46] because god is taking that heavenly
[8:48] pattern and revealing himself
[8:51] in the natural and look at this little
[8:52] scripture now just for a second
[8:55] how is he revealing
[8:57] the father the word in the holy ghost
[9:00] by
[9:01] the uh water blood and spirit he's
[9:04] taking those three
[9:05] and so that he can take himself and put
[9:07] himself in the flesh and make himself
[9:10] made manifest now let me uh let me go
[9:12] over to let's go over to i said we're
[9:15] going to read colossians 1 26.7 and i
[9:17] completely forgot about that for a
[9:18] second
[9:19] so let's go over to colossians now this
[9:22] is
[9:23] uh
[9:26] this is the scripture i believe that i
[9:28] think it's really interesting because i
[9:29] kind of believe that colossians 1 26 27
[9:33] parallels
[9:34] genesis 4 26 27
[9:39] now here's the pattern that we're
[9:40] talking about the pattern in the heavens
[9:41] that god is trying to make manifest
[9:43] right and all down through the through
[9:45] the ages this was a mystery
[9:47] that nobody really understood now as
[9:49] they brought the onyx stones and all the
[9:52] the gold and silver and all these things
[9:54] they had no idea what god's real plan
[9:57] and purpose was they were just following
[9:59] the leading of their messenger and
[10:01] uh
[10:02] you know down as brother branham brought
[10:04] the message for years i i feel like many
[10:07] uh didn't really understand what the
[10:09] purpose was that he said right about the
[10:11] coming of the lord the the seals would
[10:13] be revealed and
[10:15] it seems to me like
[10:17] that
[10:18] the this this uh little gospel train
[10:21] that we're on is moving faster and
[10:23] faster and pick it up more and more
[10:25] speed and the things that used to be
[10:27] kind of mysterious now are becoming so
[10:30] plain right for me anyway
[10:33] but it's just becoming wide open that
[10:35] all these little mysteries are are
[10:37] completely unveiled
[10:39] they used to be hidden and that's
[10:41] uh
[10:42] you know the gospel is preached in a
[10:45] public way jesus said i didn't i didn't
[10:47] come in secret i didn't i didn't come
[10:50] you know
[10:50] it's just put out for everybody to see
[10:53] but
[10:54] it's in your private secret place right
[10:56] where this the hidden misters are made
[10:58] known to you and that's why it can be
[11:00] revealed to you and not somebody else
[11:02] that's sitting right next to you that's
[11:04] hearing the same teaching it's because
[11:06] it's got to be a personal relationship
[11:08] and that's what this tabernacle was
[11:10] really speaking of it was speaking of
[11:12] god coming down and dwelling in a human
[11:14] vessel first christ and then you
[11:17] so that he can make that time that
[11:19] pattern in the heavens may manifest in
[11:21] your earth
[11:23] so colossians 1 26 27 okay
[11:34] uh let me start at verse 25
[11:38] whereof
[11:39] i am made a mystery
[11:42] according to the dispensation of god
[11:44] which is given to me for you
[11:46] to fulfill the word of god
[11:50] even the mystery which have been hid
[11:53] from ages and from generations but now
[11:55] is made manifest to the saints amen
[11:58] now the mystery is not do's and don'ts
[12:00] it's not uh that women should dress
[12:02] right and and not cut their hair and
[12:04] yeah and that uh clothesline gospel
[12:07] right the mystery
[12:09] will make you
[12:10] do that right right you're going to
[12:12] fulfill that that's right that's what
[12:14] the mystery is right
[12:18] i'm going to say that one more time
[12:21] let me do that one more time the mystery
[12:24] of god the pattern coming and dwelling
[12:27] in the human flesh will make you
[12:30] will bring to pass the clothesline
[12:32] gospel in your life that's what will
[12:35] make you dress right and walk right and
[12:38] live right and do right
[12:40] that's what the lived voices is that
[12:42] we're going to talk about that's the
[12:44] live the voice of god living out in his
[12:47] people's minds amen it's not it's not
[12:49] just a closed line that is god dwelling
[12:53] in human flesh amen
[12:55] even the mystery
[12:57] which has been hid from ages and from
[13:00] generations
[13:01] but now is made manifest to his saints
[13:04] amen
[13:07] you should be so thankful that you see
[13:11] this mystery because there are so many
[13:14] even around this place
[13:15] i believe that do not see
[13:18] this mystery see how you can paul is all
[13:20] plainly spoken right but you can read
[13:23] these words and not understand that's
[13:26] why it's preached perfectly but if you
[13:28] don't have a personal revelation right
[13:31] of what's being preached
[13:34] it's got to and of course the words got
[13:36] to be shown in the field before the
[13:37] spirit can make it and bring it to life
[13:39] that's why that's why the preaching of
[13:41] the gospel is so important yes
[13:43] all right verse 27 to whom god will make
[13:46] known what is the riches of the glory
[13:49] of this mystery among the gentiles
[13:52] now if you just want a little taste of
[13:54] the riches of the glory of this mystery
[13:56] then go listen to that sermon look right
[13:58] i just want to encourage that that
[14:00] sermon
[14:03] among the gentiles which is what is what
[14:07] is the mystery
[14:09] this mystery that's been hidden
[14:12] christ in you the hope of glory
[14:15] whom we preach warning every man and
[14:17] teaching every man and all wisdom
[14:20] let me just finish up with this because
[14:21] i wasn't planning but that we may
[14:23] present every man perfect in christ
[14:25] jesus whereunto i also labor striving
[14:28] according to his working which worketh
[14:30] in me mindly and i like that because
[14:33] even if nobody else's belief even if
[14:35] even if nobody you know what if what if
[14:37] uh
[14:38] a thousand people heard me preach it and
[14:41] only one person came to the lord and and
[14:44] saw this mystery that i i believe that's
[14:46] that's worth it just for that one soul
[14:49] because absolutely if all the world says
[14:52] that that this is wrong that this is
[14:54] incorrect and and calls you names and
[14:56] you know the early apostles they they
[14:58] encountered it wonderful
[15:00] they're privileged to be to be uh
[15:03] scourged and struck
[15:05] and all those things it's
[15:12] so
[15:13] now look look how god back in the
[15:15] beginning he he he he worked through a
[15:18] process to bring this pattern down to
[15:21] earth and he even in
[15:23] the days of creation he started through
[15:24] a process and look how in this day it
[15:27] kind of it kind of parallels him and
[15:29] just bear with me a second now follow me
[15:32] because now as god began to create
[15:36] move in his creation first thing he did
[15:38] maybe was he uh
[15:40] gave life to a little fishy
[15:42] and then a little moved up a little bit
[15:44] and and he said uh looked out into the
[15:46] trees and said uh i want a squirrel
[15:49] right there
[15:51] and but then he moved into what his real
[15:55] plan and purpose was
[15:56] was to bring that pattern down
[15:59] into human flesh so that he could have
[16:01] fellowship and so god spoke and that
[16:04] pattern came down and walked
[16:06] in adam
[16:10] in human flesh
[16:13] i hope you can see what what god is
[16:15] doing with it right with this smash is
[16:16] today right how brother branham came and
[16:19] he spoke to a little fishy right and
[16:21] brought it to life and then he spoke to
[16:22] the squirrels and said a little fish a
[16:25] little squirrel is going to run out on
[16:26] the limb over there but then what really
[16:29] is happening the whole plan and purpose
[16:32] is for god for that pattern to come down
[16:34] and leaving us right
[16:37] right and that pattern cannot be
[16:40] complete if you add your own idea if you
[16:43] add if you think and you know
[16:46] we can have really good ideas we're
[16:48] gonna have really what seems to be
[16:51] like a good idea i think it would be a
[16:53] good idea just for example for me to go
[16:55] work for such a such company or for me
[16:57] to go do such a thing i think it will be
[17:00] good but some many times those ideas are
[17:04] are fraught with peril and don't end up
[17:07] in the right way but in everything in
[17:10] your life if you will seek the will of
[17:12] god
[17:15] and if you read the message look because
[17:18] in that brother branham says and he's
[17:20] quoting how brother branham said that if
[17:23] uh or jesus said if i if you're in me
[17:26] and my words abide in you right then ask
[17:29] what you will and it will be given to
[17:31] you why
[17:32] why is that so
[17:34] because you're asking according to
[17:36] what's in the pattern and the pattern
[17:38] is already finished man
[17:41] what's in the pattern the pattern is
[17:43] already complete
[17:45] that's right you know what the pattern
[17:46] is is your inheritance right right it's
[17:48] your it's your body change it's your
[17:50] healing
[17:53] a happy marriage it's everything that
[17:56] god has laid out for you
[17:59] so that he so that the pattern his plan
[18:02] and purpose can be made manifest in your
[18:04] earth
[18:05] and i'm trying to make
[18:07] where
[18:08] the message looked
[18:09] 1963
[18:14] that's right
[18:17] um
[18:20] so you know as the children of israel
[18:22] journey through the wilderness
[18:24] they you know they failed to meet that
[18:25] pattern when they got to cades barnea
[18:27] but then as they moved on and and the
[18:30] the ones that failed to believe
[18:32] uh died off they began to get more and
[18:34] more locked in locksteps
[18:36] and i believe that
[18:38] if you read in joshua and different
[18:41] chapters in bible to talk about their
[18:42] approach
[18:43] to the to the jordan
[18:46] river it just thrills me to see how they
[18:48] begin to move more and more in lockstep
[18:51] in perfect harmony with the message
[18:53] and with a message for their day until
[18:55] when they when i i believe when rehab
[18:57] maybe looked across the river and she
[18:59] saw them moving
[19:01] with the word in the middle and the
[19:02] pillar of fire leaving them and signs
[19:05] and wonders following and everything was
[19:07] just perfectly in line she saw there so
[19:09] that's what i see i see the pattern
[19:12] living and i want to be like that that
[19:14] that is something that attracted her so
[19:17] they the the pattern was that they were
[19:19] conforming to the pattern of their day
[19:21] but the pattern was still not that
[19:24] that's not what god's plan and purpose
[19:26] was the pattern was not real did not
[19:28] really begin to be made manifest until
[19:30] one day
[19:32] mary said be it unto me according to thy
[19:34] word
[19:36] and that just her saying that
[19:38] whatever whatever the aim the messenger
[19:40] says i agree with it and that allowed
[19:44] the pattern to be to the the
[19:46] the pattern was christ himself let's let
[19:49] you know let me we don't have much time
[19:51] left so i'm going to jump ahead and read
[19:53] some of these quotes
[19:54] about what the pattern is because you
[19:56] know brother brown talked about that
[19:57] that god chooses us by the pattern and
[20:00] there's all these quotes about how he he
[20:02] cut out the pattern and
[20:03] you know for you when i was growing up
[20:05] you know it's like how did well is it
[20:07] random is he choosing the pattern
[20:09] randomly like
[20:11] cutting it out he didn't mean a mighty
[20:12] mother
[20:14] so ephesians one to four as courtney as
[20:16] he has chosen us in him before the
[20:19] foundation of the world that we should
[20:20] be holding without blame before him in
[20:21] love amen
[20:23] he chose us because he saw us in that
[20:25] pattern before the foundation of the
[20:27] world having predestinated us under the
[20:29] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[20:31] himself according to the pleasure of his
[20:33] will
[20:34] and the infallibility of god spoken word
[20:36] in 1956 he cannot deceive those whose
[20:39] names have been written in the book of
[20:40] life from the foundation of the world
[20:42] the same god that spoke and christ was
[20:44] crucified before the foundation of the
[20:45] world the same one called you at that
[20:47] time
[20:48] and wrote your name in the book
[20:51] that doesn't that just make you through
[20:52] all the all the things button out now
[20:54] the pattern with all the little knobs
[20:56] and all the little things all those
[20:58] details and you were in that pattern if
[21:01] i'm kind of dramatizing a little bit if
[21:03] you could take that tabernacle because
[21:05] the tabernacle
[21:07] is is representative of what the real
[21:10] pattern is and where you know this this
[21:12] pyramid on the wall is representative of
[21:15] the pattern but if you take take that
[21:16] tabernacle that symbolizes a three-part
[21:19] being a body spirit and soul stand it up
[21:22] right and what do you have you have
[21:24] christ right and that's what we're
[21:26] trying to conform to we're trying to
[21:27] conform to christ to the image of the
[21:30] living god
[21:31] so god places the pattern in 1954
[21:34] questions and answers um
[21:36] while jesus told the disciples that he
[21:38] was with them and he had chosen and knew
[21:40] them before the foundation of the world
[21:41] was ever laid is that right so god
[21:43] places the pattern
[21:47] and he said now they're being elite
[21:49] they'll go in the rapture and there'll
[21:50] be a group of people that's good upright
[21:52] holy living god said people that will
[21:53] not be in the rapture and they'll come
[21:55] up in the second resurrection because
[21:58] now they they don't go all the way this
[22:01] is me for them saying they don't go all
[22:03] the way through justification and
[22:05] satisfaction they're bashing the holy
[22:06] ghost to meet to conform to that pattern
[22:09] because that's the way
[22:11] to to get into that pattern you must be
[22:13] in him
[22:15] i'm trying to hurry
[22:21] and events made clear by prophecy 1965
[22:26] he says see the world and the people are
[22:28] watching for some little outlet some
[22:30] little bypass some little shortcut but
[22:32] there's no shortcuts in the word of god
[22:34] you must you got to come by he has he
[22:36] has provided away all the little steps
[22:39] and he says there's there's one pattern
[22:42] you must cut yourself and fit that
[22:43] pattern
[22:46] not try to cut the pattern to fit you
[22:47] right that's right
[22:49] everybody must do that
[22:51] that's the only way god has of doing it
[22:56] so what is our pattern
[22:58] the marriage of the lamb 1962
[23:00] and no wonder people says they haven't
[23:02] got what they say they've got this
[23:04] church of the pentecostal move off to be
[23:06] so bound together with the power of
[23:08] almighty god until the very life of
[23:10] jesus christ will be reflected in it why
[23:12] is that if the pattern that heavenly
[23:15] pattern is living in you
[23:17] then you will be exactly like that
[23:18] pattern
[23:19] you know the early church the defeat in
[23:22] ephesians when paul began to preach that
[23:24] we all look back to that because that is
[23:26] our pattern we've got to compare back to
[23:28] that the same god that was back there
[23:31] doing signs and wonders and and
[23:34] preaching the word and doing those
[23:35] things
[23:36] should be living in our lives today
[23:38] right
[23:40] but we want the pattern after the world
[23:42] he says we're going to do it anyhow
[23:45] in that something we're going to do it
[23:47] anyhow
[23:48] that's our problem is we'll get
[23:50] something in our eye and our mind or
[23:52] something would think it's a good idea
[23:54] and it sounds real good and we won't go
[23:56] back and compare it with the word right
[23:58] right right
[24:00] and you know what to be honest that kind
[24:01] of
[24:02] it scares me i think in a good way
[24:05] when i am studying to come out and
[24:07] preach because i'm afraid that maybe i'm
[24:10] remembering something that is just a
[24:12] table book or something that i heard i
[24:14] want to go back and make sure
[24:16] that brother brown said it right because
[24:19] we should be going back to the pattern
[24:21] go back to the to the bible to make sure
[24:24] that everything lines up just right you
[24:26] know paul said that the the bible the
[24:28] pattern is a is like a mirror that you
[24:30] can look you can look into and see where
[24:32] you are the statue of the perfect man
[24:34] where you are right in in god's plan and
[24:36] how far along the building process is
[24:40] has god just laid the foundation or is
[24:42] he is he almost complete right is he
[24:45] where where is he in the building
[24:46] process
[24:48] we're going to do it anyhow see we want
[24:50] to have our way about it but we
[24:52] shouldn't do it it's wrong to do it the
[24:54] churches is just like the woman went
[24:56] wild
[24:57] let me see
[24:59] so in the message why
[25:02] in 1962
[25:05] paragraph e33
[25:08] he said that's the way it is today that
[25:10] the churches are trying to pattern after
[25:12] the other churches that's right
[25:14] and that's something you can try to
[25:16] pattern after that you can try to
[25:18] pattern after after uh get some man that
[25:21] you think is living a real good life and
[25:23] pattern after them and then uh years
[25:25] down the road they might slip and do
[25:26] something or who knows but if you keep
[25:29] your eye on the on christ
[25:33] then
[25:34] that that is what he says christ is our
[25:38] pattern
[25:38] so exactly then and now that's what he's
[25:41] cutting he's cutting out to choose a
[25:43] bride
[25:44] he's cutting out
[25:46] that that those that match the pattern
[25:48] which is christ
[25:50] if when he looks at us and sees himself
[25:52] reflected back and sees himself in us
[25:55] walking and talking and and living
[25:57] exactly like he did and and believing
[26:00] his word
[26:01] and trusting in him
[26:04] and he says now they didn't want it they
[26:05] didn't want the message what what if
[26:07] that king would have humbled himself
[26:09] what if he could have come down to many
[26:11] millions and went back to god and
[26:12] repented
[26:14] and uh
[26:16] i forget who he was talking about
[26:19] several examples in the bible that
[26:21] didn't listen
[26:22] of those that didn't listen
[26:27] and uh i'll just read a few more and
[26:30] we'll finish up
[26:31] and and the voice of god in this last
[26:33] days 1963 he says you can't base your
[26:36] eternal destination upon some sensation
[26:38] satan can impersonate any of those
[26:40] sensations not it's to know christ
[26:43] something changes in your life watch
[26:45] your life and pattern it with the word
[26:47] and see where you're at taking inventory
[26:50] certainly and why i'm against organized
[26:53] religion in 1962 he says you know in the
[26:55] dedication this morning moses followed
[26:57] the pattern that he saw in heaven
[26:59] and pitched a tent to represent it when
[27:02] solomon built the temple he what did he
[27:04] do follow the pattern that moses by the
[27:07] tent keeping the scripture in line
[27:09] and when god come to his temple for the
[27:11] last days this temple the holy ghost
[27:15] a body has now prepared him the holy
[27:17] ghost fell on the day of pentecost
[27:19] the message was repent every one of you
[27:21] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[27:23] christ for the remissions of submission
[27:26] of sins and you shall receive the gift
[27:28] of the holy ghost
[27:29] for the promises unto you and to your
[27:31] children and to them that fall even as
[27:33] many as the lord our god
[27:35] shall call
[27:37] if you want to call your minister a
[27:39] doctor dr simon peter wrote a
[27:40] prescription an eternal prescription
[27:43] that's what cures the sick
[27:50] and then he i just had that quote about
[27:53] how he he died for you at calvary and
[27:56] god's provided away 1953 in there he was
[27:58] wounded for our transgressions bruised
[28:00] for our iniquity the chastisement of our
[28:02] peace upon him with his stripes we were
[28:04] healed so you can look at that and look
[28:07] and see how god took that pattern that
[28:09] pattern
[28:10] is made manifest now for you to take
[28:12] advantage of everything that was in that
[28:14] pattern is available for you to read the
[28:16] benefits now
[28:18] if you need healing or whatever
[28:20] i believe that that that should increase
[28:22] our faith
[28:23] it helped my faith to see that all the
[28:26] things that are in the pattern are now
[28:28] may manifest for now to take to take
[28:30] benefit of them to take advantage of and
[28:32] i'll just finish that right amen amen
