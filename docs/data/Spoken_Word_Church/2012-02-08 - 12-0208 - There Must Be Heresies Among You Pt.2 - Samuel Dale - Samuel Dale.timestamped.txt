[2:57] amen thank
[3:00] in 1 Corinthians
[3:03] 11 verse 8 18 and
[3:08] 19 first of all when you come together
[3:11] in the church I hear that there be
[3:12] divisions among you and I'm partly
[3:14] believe it for there must need must be
[3:17] also heresies among you that they which
[3:20] are approved may be made manifest among
[3:23] you now see it's not bad for things to
[3:25] come Among Us right as long as the holy
[3:28] spirit is there too amen keep us in the
[3:30] right thing right okay then we go over
[3:33] to 1 Peter 3:1
[3:38] 15 but sanctify the Lord God in your
[3:41] hearts and be ready always to give an
[3:42] answer to every man that askthis of the
[3:45] hope that is in you with meekness and
[3:49] fear amen you may be seated to the Lord
[3:52] add his Blessing to the reading of the
[3:54] word now I announced for a while there
[3:58] that we were going to take some
[4:00] um doctrinal issues and things that some
[4:03] of the people of the message believe and
[4:06] try to to show you why we don't believe
[4:08] them and that's right and things like
[4:10] that now there's plenty of things that
[4:12] we do believe we do believe all the word
[4:14] of God Amen but there are some that have
[4:17] done just like all other uh religious uh
[4:21] groups or whatever you want to call them
[4:23] denominations and things they they're
[4:25] just the same way among us to where that
[4:28] that there's many people who believe
[4:30] different things and as your pastor I
[4:35] feel I'm obligated to just speak about
[4:37] those things you know at times because
[4:40] there may be new ones Among Us and and
[4:42] different things and a lot watching in
[4:44] on the internet and everything like that
[4:46] and they Wonder well what do you
[4:48] believe well as a one
[4:52] believer I believe that God's word is
[4:54] the answer to all
[4:57] things I believe it is is it's you know
[5:01] it's the answer so we go back into God's
[5:03] word to get our answer amen that's right
[5:06] it's not to what we just try to decide
[5:07] what's right or vote on what's right or
[5:10] you know opinions and thoughts and ideas
[5:13] are all fine but what does the word say
[5:17] that's the main thing that we want to
[5:18] talk about you know to keep it in line
[5:21] and as I said then there is many groups
[5:24] many people around the land that follow
[5:27] different things and I don't have
[5:28] anything against anybody what you follow
[5:31] as long as you don't try to make me
[5:33] believe it that's the difference in it
[5:35] when it comes down to try to make me
[5:36] believe what you think then I I might
[5:39] Rebel just a little bit and you know be
[5:42] just a tad bit stubborn about it because
[5:45] you know and I don't believe in doing
[5:48] like you can do we got a little old
[5:50] horse there now and you know she started
[5:52] out pretty stubborn when we first
[5:54] brought her up and brother Donnie told
[5:55] me how to handle her so you know I pet
[5:58] her and and give her a little extra
[6:00] attention and and give her a little you
[6:02] know couple of handfuls of some uh feed
[6:06] there you know and I've got her to where
[6:07] now I just go over there and I just call
[6:09] her name and she'll just come right on
[6:11] the where up at you know I go get the
[6:13] bucket and she goes into the barn well
[6:16] that's fine but uh I've never been one
[6:20] that uh you know that petting and and
[6:23] pampered made me get on the side of
[6:25] anybody right that's my point I I just
[6:28] I'm just not that way you can brag about
[6:30] me and say what you want to about me but
[6:33] it won't change what I think right and
[6:36] I'm going to just tell you what I think
[6:38] and in that way you don't have to worry
[6:39] about it you know nobody has to be
[6:41] concerned and say well what the say
[6:43] believe you just come and ask me and
[6:45] I'll tell you I won't to I won't borrow
[6:47] no holes and I'll tell you and we Bor
[6:51] we've took away the point we will not
[6:53] call names of people who have these
[6:55] doctrines but if you want to come to my
[6:58] office or atten around here to somebody
[7:00] they'll be glad to uh you know maybe
[7:03] tell you who this is that we're talking
[7:05] about but I don't believe it needs to be
[7:07] add out on the internet system because
[7:09] that's not good cuz you'll know when you
[7:13] bring out a Doctrine people of the
[7:14] message know what doctor and they've
[7:16] always tried to put me in some kind of a
[7:18] camp but I've just never been one that
[7:21] would that like to be that way I just
[7:23] like to be myself you know and I like to
[7:26] fellowship with everybody and just have
[7:27] a good time and you know just forget it
[7:30] and and let everything go and you don't
[7:32] agree with me that's fine but I wish
[7:34] you'd tell me you don't agree with me
[7:36] that's you know if people go out and
[7:38] tell everybody else that that you don't
[7:40] agree with with brother Dale well that's
[7:42] that's not good just come tell me about
[7:43] it or or call me or whatever you know
[7:45] somebody on the internet you you're
[7:47] welcome to it and make sure you do it
[7:49] before midnight and the night cuz I
[7:51] don't want to be up in the morning you
[7:52] know talking on the telephone and all
[7:55] with you but you know I I'm I'm open for
[7:59] inst instructiveness into her that I
[8:02] want to be
[8:03] right but now we covered a doctrine that
[8:06] was way on back many years ago and a lot
[8:09] of people are still following after it
[8:12] it was called two
[8:13] souls and the doctrine on point there
[8:16] was that God gave your soul and Satan
[8:19] gave your soul and and uh if you was
[8:23] capable of being born again you you got
[8:25] two because God gave you one and Satan
[8:27] gave you one and that way you just
[8:30] destroyed the one that Satan gave you
[8:32] and and you always was eternal well I I
[8:35] just couldn't see that I can't follow
[8:37] that point because uh you know I I
[8:41] believe the soul of man as I brought out
[8:43] to you is the part of you that's real
[8:46] right amen your body you say well my
[8:49] body it's real I can feel it but the
[8:51] soul is more real because the soul lives
[8:54] on after the body goes to the grave and
[8:57] will one day either be uh brought as to
[9:01] a lot of people will be be given eternal
[9:03] life or they will be cast into the Lake
[9:06] of Fire and that will be the death of
[9:08] the Soul which is what the Bible calls
[9:10] in the Book of Revelations the second
[9:11] death right all right so we covered that
[9:14] you know then we just picked a couple of
[9:16] topics to go across the line to kind of
[9:19] hold in that same form to see that
[9:21] you'll see that a lot of these doctrines
[9:23] come from one point that's right and
[9:26] that's the way it is there's no new
[9:27] doctrine there's uh you know all the
[9:30] doctrines was back in the in the Bible
[9:33] and you can go back in there and find
[9:34] them you know all the way back into
[9:36] Genesis and find all of the doctrines of
[9:39] mankind and and all like that and like
[9:41] I'm I've always said I I'm not against
[9:45] anybody I'm not against anybody for what
[9:47] they believe you know because uh we all
[9:51] have our own belief thoughts and ideas
[9:53] but what I'm against is people trying to
[9:56] teach other people the the the Bible the
[10:00] things when it's not in there right and
[10:02] then I just say well I just don't
[10:03] believe it you know uh my wife used to
[10:06] tell me that it was in the Bible that
[10:08] you wouldn't be able in the end of the
[10:10] time to be able to tell the the
[10:12] difference in the seasons except the of
[10:14] the the uh buding of the trees and the
[10:17] shedding of the leaves and I told her I
[10:20] said well honey I've read it through and
[10:22] I never found it you know it's not in
[10:25] there well I've got the computer systems
[10:27] if you want to check it you can run
[10:28] conord and things it's not in there and
[10:31] I told her I said the one reason it is
[10:33] because you always have summer and
[10:35] winter right you know that's going to
[10:37] remain until you know the it's over so
[10:41] that means you're going to have the
[10:42] shedding of the leaves and the budding
[10:43] of the trees and all and you've heard
[10:45] the old saying that every tub was sit on
[10:47] its own bottom well that's not in the
[10:49] Bible I want somebody to come show me
[10:51] you know that it's in there but see
[10:53] that's the way people to do they'll just
[10:54] say the Bible says oh yeah well at least
[10:57] tell me where it's at you know at least
[11:00] let me read it for myself and and that
[11:02] way then we'll talk about it amen but
[11:05] there was a Doctrine started years ago
[11:07] that kind of I believe came off of this
[11:10] two Soul point and uh it came down to a
[11:15] group of people and they they started
[11:17] teaching two
[11:19] Lords and uh in that then their Doctrine
[11:24] was uh accepted by a lot of people
[11:28] around the land and
[11:30] and you know in Foreign Fields and
[11:32] things like that and it's still going of
[11:35] believing that there's two
[11:36] Lords
[11:38] well I just happen to to remember in
[11:41] Ephesians
[11:43] 4 that the Bible says there's one Lord
[11:47] One Faith right and one baptism that's
[11:51] right well you know I just can't go
[11:54] along with that and uh you know
[12:00] Deuteronomy the the first commandment is
[12:05] what there's only one
[12:08] Lord we're commanded to love the
[12:12] Lord Our God not our Gods
[12:15] right right amen all right and and
[12:20] Zechariah says that there would be one
[12:23] Lord and one
[12:25] name amen and we can go through a lot of
[12:28] it in the Bible of doing and covering
[12:30] but you know there there is a Doctrine
[12:33] in the land of of organized religion is
[12:36] called
[12:38] trinitarianism and uh that doctrine of
[12:41] trinitarianism is to believe that
[12:43] there's three
[12:44] Gods well right then there's the
[12:47] doctrine of what you call the
[12:50] Oneness that you know they go to the the
[12:54] Trinity goes one way the Oneness go to
[12:56] The Other Extreme of being that Jesus
[13:00] was you know the last form of God or or
[13:05] coming down like father son Holy Ghost
[13:07] like your finger being one and I I I
[13:11] just can't seem to go along with that
[13:13] idea because of all of what the Bible is
[13:16] well then we thought we had it figured
[13:18] out because we thought we were in the
[13:20] middle and we'll get down to some points
[13:22] of interest in a minute about this and
[13:25] maybe it'll help but we thought we had
[13:28] it right when we were has tried to
[13:29] explain it that it was God in three
[13:31] persons
[13:32] y Blessed Trinity now there's no such
[13:36] thing in the Bible as the word Trinity
[13:38] right the word Trinity was adapted uh
[13:41] along up after
[13:44] um let's see I think I've got it in here
[13:48] but I'm not no but anyhow uh the word
[13:52] Trinity was adopted later I can give you
[13:54] the man's name you hold on a minute uh
[14:02] his name was t e r t u i l i a n and he
[14:07] pronounce it but he started teaching
[14:09] along about um Now Catch the point about
[14:14] 225 ad it was about 100 years before
[14:18] they had the what was called the Nan
[14:21] Council the first one 325 ad all right
[14:25] and the Trinity was was not in the Bible
[14:28] it's not very in in any form you know
[14:31] but they begin to teach it as a
[14:34] trinitarian concept along about 200 and
[14:37] something years after the death of the
[14:40] Apostles and you know I mean death of
[14:42] the Lord Jesus and uh it developed up
[14:46] until when actually you came to 3:25 I'm
[14:50] laying this in the line now to just show
[14:52] you why I don't believe in the two Lords
[14:54] because of the statement that they make
[14:56] of their
[14:57] Doctrine they actually make the
[14:59] statement cuz I heard the man personally
[15:01] he said that he believed Jesus was a
[15:04] different person from
[15:07] God he said God was one person Jesus was
[15:10] another person well if it's two persons
[15:14] it's two personalities that's right the
[15:17] two personalities is two individuals
[15:20] that's right and that's the reason I
[15:21] don't agree with it because that's see
[15:23] that's the reason I don't agree with the
[15:24] Trinity you say God in three
[15:27] persons Blessed Trinity
[15:31] well how can it be God in three
[15:36] persons a person is a personality a
[15:39] personality is an individual an
[15:41] individual is a person right that's
[15:43] simple and and I'm a ninth grade
[15:45] education person and I can understand it
[15:47] that way right right because see you
[15:50] can't put it together as being three
[15:53] Gods you said no we don't believe that
[15:56] but it's God in three persons Blessed
[15:58] Trinity see and this is their Doctrine
[16:00] co-equal and co-eternal
[16:03] well how can a son be e Co coeternal
[16:07] with the
[16:09] father and and you don't find that in
[16:11] the scripture see Jesus said unless you
[16:13] believe that I am he amen you'll die in
[16:17] your sin that's right even uh I'll get
[16:20] to it in a few minutes somewhere in here
[16:23] that you know that the devil believed in
[16:25] one
[16:27] God and trembles about about it that's
[16:30] where's that at that's uh James 2:9
[16:33] right that Satan even believed in one
[16:36] God and trembled right yeah you know he
[16:40] was afraid he he knew what it was but
[16:42] yet see we we come up with the thought
[16:45] and idea of saying well we we can't
[16:47] understand it right well the Bible says
[16:50] the Eternal
[16:52] godhead it's in Timothy says the Eternal
[16:55] godhead can be understood by the things
[16:58] that we
[16:59] s that's right you right God doesn't
[17:03] leave us
[17:04] blinded he reveals himself in the
[17:07] scriptures and he hides
[17:09] himself that's why it's got to be
[17:11] revealed right amen but to look at it
[17:16] simply I I'm I'm one
[17:20] person all right I'm a
[17:23] father but you know what I'm a son of a
[17:26] father that makes me a son right man all
[17:29] right I'm a human being I'm Samuel Dale
[17:31] I'm a former employee of gentle Motors
[17:33] retired you know a pastor of a church uh
[17:36] Etc can come up with many many different
[17:38] titles that's right but I'm only one
[17:41] person
[17:43] right see I believe that God is many
[17:47] manifestations Father and Son and Holy
[17:49] Ghost is not three Gods right there
[17:52] three manifestations of the same
[17:54] God right and see being three
[17:56] manifestations then are the same God why
[17:59] would you want to go to two Lords about
[18:04] it why would you want to cover our
[18:06] thought an idea that there was two Lords
[18:08] that Jesus being one Lord and God being
[18:12] another
[18:12] Lord see it's mankind trying with their
[18:16] intellectual conception to figure out
[18:18] the word of God right amen well the
[18:20] Bible said it is of no private
[18:23] interpretation that's right now that's
[18:25] scripture and he said it can only be
[18:27] revealed
[18:29] the Bible says no man can call Jesus the
[18:32] Christ except it be by the Holy Ghost
[18:35] right now anybody with the ability to
[18:37] open their
[18:39] mouth and enough brain to be able to say
[18:42] Jesus is the Christ right that don't
[18:45] mean they're saved right no so that's
[18:48] not what it's talking about that's right
[18:49] it's not talking about just because you
[18:51] can say Jesus is the Christ it's when
[18:54] something within you shows you that's
[18:57] right amen right and it can only be done
[19:00] by God himself revealing it that's right
[19:03] so that's why man's tried to figure it
[19:05] out but like I said I'm many I have many
[19:08] manifestations you do
[19:11] too many manifestations in your life but
[19:14] you're only one person right amen God
[19:17] has many
[19:19] manifestations but he's only one person
[19:21] he's
[19:23] God see then we go along and we try to
[19:25] make it God the Father God the son God
[19:28] the holy ho ghost
[19:30] now how can that be because you're
[19:32] making it three persons
[19:36] right and see if you do believe in a
[19:39] trinitarian thought who is your savior
[19:43] right well Jesus is well then see you've
[19:46] left the father and the holy ghost out
[19:48] of
[19:49] it and according to the Bible it says
[19:52] that the Holy Ghost would come and live
[19:53] in you right right Jesus said I am my
[19:57] father right I'm quoting scriptures come
[19:59] on right I and my father will come and
[20:02] take our Abode in
[20:04] you well then it has to be that the
[20:08] father and the Holy Ghost is the self
[20:09] same person amen that's right and what
[20:12] they can't understand people about the
[20:14] godhead is is the basis of of the fact
[20:18] that God could come
[20:22] down create a body Hebrews 10:5 a body
[20:26] th has prepared me
[20:29] and when that body came forth in the
[20:31] wound of that virgin that was bed to to
[20:33] produce it right she never brought an
[20:37] egg right you didn't have an egg that
[20:39] would make the body come in from mankind
[20:42] cuz your egg your body comes to
[20:44] reproduction of the
[20:45] egg you know from the mother right all
[20:48] right and if it was true then that would
[20:51] make his body just like my body it
[20:53] wouldn't be you know a virgin born
[20:57] there'd be no need of it you might as
[20:58] well let it come from some other way let
[20:59] God come down cuz a lot of the Jews
[21:02] today believe that the Messiah this one
[21:05] died just back a few years ago about 90
[21:07] years old up in New York that they a lot
[21:09] of the Jews believ that he was the
[21:11] Messiah cuz they believe that's what's
[21:13] going to happen God is going to come
[21:14] down and thenwell something but
[21:17] according to the Bible right the Bible
[21:20] said he was born Lord to
[21:25] Christ he was born Emmanuel according to
[21:28] the Bible
[21:29] oh yeah which means god with us all
[21:32] right now see then if if like I said
[21:35] like the brothers believe or the people
[21:37] believe that there's two Lords then
[21:39] where are you going to fit it
[21:41] in that's right where are you going to
[21:43] try to bring in right that there's one
[21:45] Lord for one thing and one Lord for
[21:47] another that's a trinitarian concept
[21:50] amen and what I've always said
[21:53] is on the point that we spent all of the
[21:57] years in this one brother that really uh
[22:00] teaches it was the one who uh edited or
[22:04] or wrote out the church age book and the
[22:07] church a book is vastly covered over the
[22:10] fact of one true and living God Amen and
[22:13] then after run around and leaves the
[22:14] scene he comes up with the idea that
[22:17] there's two
[22:18] Lords because he couldn't see the truth
[22:21] of one God that's right yeah well you
[22:23] could take his own book that he wrote to
[22:25] him and lay it down he' say well I
[22:26] didn't understand that well I agree with
[22:29] him he didn't understand it or he
[22:30] wouldn't believe it now but how can you
[22:33] have two Lords when as I quoted in
[22:36] Ephesians there it says there's one
[22:38] Lord right one
[22:41] Faith one
[22:45] baptism all right they said then what
[22:47] man has come up with the idea is that
[22:50] Jesus is one person substance
[22:55] identity and God is another yeah lord
[22:59] well now most people don't go back and
[23:02] read I I enjoy reading right always have
[23:06] and that was one of the things I guess
[23:08] God gave me uh you know I always love to
[23:11] read and uh even in school I I love to
[23:15] read but I hated to do book reports but
[23:18] uh I I love to read and uh I've always
[23:22] been that way when somebody says
[23:23] something I try to find out right amen
[23:27] so at all always been concerned and this
[23:29] has been many years it's been 40
[23:31] something years ago right that I had an
[23:35] opportunity through a brother that had
[23:38] some of the pran fathers and the naan
[23:42] fathers books big old books you know
[23:44] great big things you know and and I I
[23:47] didn't read all of it but I wanted to
[23:49] know what was you know why was it coming
[23:54] up with a trinity and where it came from
[23:57] Jo I went back in there and I begin to
[24:00] read and study on those things to see
[24:04] and I come to find out that most people
[24:06] don't even know what happened at the
[24:07] first Nan council at 325 ad they think
[24:12] it was arguing over three gods or one it
[24:14] was not right I've read it and I quoted
[24:18] I gave you a quote out of it to where
[24:20] that you could could do it and be glad
[24:22] for you if all you got to do is just put
[24:24] nicely in counsil and click on your
[24:27] computer amen
[24:28] and you can read for weeks and weeks and
[24:31] weeks and weeks on the Nan Council
[24:34] because the books are like that and
[24:35] great big volumes of them you know all
[24:37] right so you have an opportunity to find
[24:40] out where it comes from but I went in
[24:43] there and I began to study it and I
[24:44] thought well where does this Trinity
[24:46] concept come
[24:48] from and as I begin to read and study on
[24:51] it I found out the man's name and they
[24:53] gave you a moment ago that he he started
[24:55] with the word
[24:56] Trinity but when they come to the Nan
[24:59] Council it was not an argument over
[25:01] whether there was one God or three
[25:04] Gods the trinitarian concept had not
[25:07] taken
[25:08] hold was already beginning to be taught
[25:11] but hadn't taken
[25:13] hold but what had what took hold was
[25:15] there was a man named
[25:18] Aras and there was a man that was his
[25:21] name was elexander
[25:23] and he didn't even go to didn't debate
[25:27] it he had a a deacon that was in his
[25:29] evidently his
[25:30] church and he is something about R
[25:34] atheist or something like that and they
[25:36] were the two basic people at Nan Council
[25:40] 325 ad in their
[25:42] discussion
[25:44] well
[25:46] arus was basically holding to the one
[25:49] true and living God
[25:52] concept trying to hold on to it but yet
[25:56] I'll agree that even at that time time
[25:58] if you read it closely that the thoughts
[26:01] had already begin to impregnate their
[26:04] mind at NAA even those with the truth
[26:08] because they were beginning to think
[26:10] about and considering the fact of Jesus
[26:13] being an eternal
[26:15] son that was already beginning to to to
[26:19] get in and how can you have an eternal
[26:21] son that's not even
[26:23] sensible you know sons are not Eternal
[26:26] they're begotten that's right all right
[26:28] and as I began to study more of it and
[26:30] be glad to to show you that these two in
[26:33] their discussion the main point was was
[26:36] whether Jesus was
[26:40] God Almighty embodied in
[26:44] flesh you know one true and living God
[26:49] or whether or not he was another
[26:53] substance which if he's another
[26:55] substance then he would be another
[26:57] person
[26:59] so you can see the Trinity as it begins
[27:01] to ease in that's right the thought of
[27:04] substance was what they were
[27:08] discussing you know to whether or not
[27:10] that was the real
[27:12] substance and
[27:15] surprisingly I gave it to
[27:17] you if they want to pull it up a lot of
[27:20] people talking about the n and Creed any
[27:23] of you ever read the n in
[27:26] Creed brother boy read his
[27:29] you ever really read the n and
[27:34] Creek the surpris is what the n and
[27:37] Creed
[27:41] says let's just read the n and Creed now
[27:44] taken right out of the
[27:45] book I believe in one
[27:48] God the Father Almighty see everybody
[27:51] thinks a I see in Creed was a
[27:53] trinitarian
[27:55] concept
[27:57] right it wasn't read it this is what
[28:00] they came up with from 325 ad took a
[28:03] little while to get along a year or
[28:05] something but they established this
[28:07] called an nian
[28:09] Creed I believe in one God the Father
[28:12] Almighty maker of heaven and Earth and
[28:14] of all things visible and
[28:16] invisible in one Lord Jesus Christ the
[28:19] only begotten Son of God begotten of the
[28:23] father before all
[28:25] worlds God now this speaking of Jesus
[28:28] God of
[28:29] God light of light very God of very God
[28:35] begotten not made being of one substance
[28:40] with the father by whom all things were
[28:47] made that's nice in
[28:52] Creek
[28:54] one for who was for who who for us men
[28:59] and for our Salvation came down from
[29:02] heaven and was incarnate by the Holy
[29:05] Spirit of the Virgin Mary and was made
[29:07] man and was crucified also for us under
[29:11] Pontius pilot he suffered and was buried
[29:13] and the third day he rose again
[29:15] according to the scriptures and ascended
[29:18] into heaven and sits on the right hand
[29:20] of the father and he shall come again
[29:22] with glory to judge the quick and the
[29:23] dead whose kingdom shall have no end now
[29:28] watch this is where a lot of people go
[29:29] haywi to try to get on down to these
[29:31] other points under it and they really it
[29:33] shakes them because of what it says but
[29:35] listen and I believe in the Holy Ghost
[29:37] the Lord and Giver of
[29:40] Life who predes from the father and the
[29:43] and the son who with the father and the
[29:45] son together is worshiped and glorified
[29:48] who spoke by the prophets now watch I
[29:53] believe in one Holy Catholic
[29:58] an Apostolic church I acknowledge one
[30:02] baptism for the remission of sins and I
[30:04] look for the resurrection of the dead
[30:07] and the life of the world to come amen
[30:10] see now most people all they know is
[30:12] those words right there and they go hey
[30:14] where because it says Holy
[30:21] Catholic Catholic means Universal right
[30:25] it doesn't mean Catholic church right no
[30:29] it means
[30:32] Universal see so it's The Universal
[30:37] Church brother rold says the Catholics
[30:40] say they were the first church he said
[30:42] they're exactly right
[30:46] sure
[30:49] y but see how many of you ever even read
[30:51] the I see in
[30:53] Creed to read that it says that
[30:58] of begotten not made being of one
[31:01] substance with the
[31:06] father that was what they were arguing
[31:08] about I see I've told you this what for
[31:11] 40
[31:13] years they were arguing over whether
[31:16] Jesus was God or another
[31:21] substance and their Creed stated he was
[31:23] the same
[31:26] substance but the the idea had already
[31:29] begin to impregnate to their
[31:32] minds and the other man or a or how you
[31:35] pronounce his
[31:37] name me they banished him from the
[31:39] kingdom read it all and I mean they
[31:41] throw him out and then they bring him
[31:43] back and uh Constantine finally gets
[31:46] baptized but there's no record he ever
[31:48] was a Christian that's right he's the
[31:50] one that set up the first night see
[31:55] counsel but see the argument there was
[31:57] whether or Not Jesus was almighty God
[32:03] or a light substance
[32:07] right which would start the idea of the
[32:09] trinitarian
[32:11] concept of God in three
[32:15] persons and would bring it down to the
[32:18] point of confusing man's
[32:21] mind and by 606 it had fully been
[32:24] developed right yeah when they came back
[32:27] to the I st in Council all
[32:30] right see we'll get back to this one
[32:33] later on when we cover some more
[32:35] Doctrine but just using it on this point
[32:38] of talking about whether there's two
[32:39] Lords or not put it on uh the other one
[32:42] that's on our brother Anderson
[32:45] s have pronounce it c e r i n t h u s
[32:51] sthus
[32:53] sthus now this is the time of
[32:56] John because he's down
[32:59] here so this is the time right after
[33:05] Christ remember Paul he'd already run
[33:07] into a lot of Heretics in his
[33:10] day Philipus and hus was teaching the
[33:12] resurrection is already
[33:14] passed Paul was rebuking him for it
[33:17] right that's why he would say there's
[33:19] heresies among you right look what it
[33:22] says about it serus distinguished
[33:25] between the man Jesus and the Christ yep
[33:28] he denied the supernatural birth of
[33:30] Jesus making him the son of Joseph and
[33:32] Mary and distinguishing him from the
[33:34] Christ who descended upon him at baptism
[33:37] right see also a doctrin ISM and left
[33:41] him again at his crucifixion watch but
[33:44] never to embody the flesh corinthus also
[33:48] said to have taught that Jesus will be
[33:51] raised from the dead at the last days
[33:53] when all men will rise with him now that
[33:57] was back in in the days of the Lord
[33:58] Jesus right after the early Apostles in
[34:01] the book of Acts right this this man was
[34:04] already teaching these
[34:05] things so when it comes down to two
[34:08] Lords
[34:09] and two gods and trinitarian isms and
[34:13] the one we'll get to later which is that
[34:15] Jesus wasn't God until the River
[34:17] Jordan you can see where their ideas
[34:20] come from it's not
[34:24] new it was what people that have t way
[34:26] on back
[34:28] in describing Jesus watching as a
[34:31] natural-born
[34:33] man sthus agreed with the Jewish
[34:37] Christian ebonites in portraying Christ
[34:41] as a spirit that came from Heaven
[34:44] undertook his Divine task in the
[34:46] material world and then returned he
[34:49] anticipates that fully developed
[34:52] Christian
[34:54] gism in later decades what John thought
[34:58] about him y according to irus polycarp
[35:02] told a story that John the
[35:05] Apostle now that's the writer in the
[35:07] book The
[35:08] Bible he said to have so
[35:11] detested
[35:12] Corinthian that he once fled a bath
[35:15] house when he found out corinthus was
[35:18] inside yelling let us flee lest the
[35:20] building fall down for cor how you
[35:24] pronounce it I can't get it the enemy of
[35:26] the truth is inside
[35:28] one tradition reminds that John wrote
[35:30] his first two Epistles to
[35:33] counter the man and his
[35:37] Doctrine we say it's not a new
[35:41] doctrine the Trinity
[35:43] concept had already crep
[35:46] in to the early
[35:51] church the trinitarian concept then
[35:56] developed as it was going brother Rand
[35:58] said from Y at n it either went
[36:04] into uh pism which is the teaching of
[36:07] trinitarianism or it went into
[36:11] Unitarianism Unitarianism is a basic
[36:14] teaching of one
[36:16] God bringing it down to Unitarian
[36:19] developing down
[36:20] into see these things are not new church
[36:24] right that's they've been taught by
[36:25] mankind all the way down through yeah
[36:28] and now the people of the message are
[36:30] teaching the same
[36:32] things that God is not one God he's at
[36:37] least
[36:38] two well is that true what do you
[36:43] believe well I really don't know what to
[36:46] believe well it's timey to start reading
[36:48] then get your Bible and start reading
[36:51] that's right I ain't got time you got
[36:53] time for everything else right your soul
[36:56] is involved in this amen that's
[37:00] right it ain't important who's going to
[37:02] be president right it's important of not
[37:06] whether you're born again right if
[37:09] you're truly born again you want to read
[37:11] the word and study the word that's right
[37:13] cu the Bible says study to show yourself
[37:15] and prove a Workman that needeth not to
[37:17] be ashamed rightly dividing the word of
[37:19] Truth now I'm quoting scripture
[37:22] there but you see what man has take
[37:25] they've taken it and see they've made
[37:27] made it into a
[37:29] concept that the Bible is totally
[37:33] against and see then what they done with
[37:35] the Catholic church then after it did
[37:37] develop as a Catholic Church the Romans
[37:40] and the Orthodox and all this cuz it
[37:42] split up to different parts of
[37:45] that they took the Bible away from the
[37:48] people and allowed them to only read
[37:51] certain that's right text y all right
[37:55] that was what was getting them in
[37:56] trouble back there of the W Cliffs and
[37:58] the different ones that were back there
[38:01] that were trying to translate the Bible
[38:04] Martin Luther even got into it after his
[38:07] thesis writing it you know and
[38:09] protesting the Catholic church he began
[38:12] to translate the Bible himself into the
[38:14] German
[38:15] language and see all of these things
[38:18] started developing from the fact of what
[38:21] people we're teaching WR
[38:23] right I've read Martin Luther's own
[38:25] writings he didn't want to leave
[38:27] Catholic Church he wanted to convert the
[38:30] church
[38:32] y he wanted them to change their ways
[38:36] amen but they wouldn't
[38:38] change and once he seen that then the
[38:40] Lord revealed to him that just shall
[38:42] live by faith that's right and he
[38:46] started to teaching that and bringing
[38:49] that out to short still believing the
[38:51] same doctrine of the Trinity of the
[38:54] Catholic
[38:55] church because that was all that could
[38:57] believe in that day is all it was talked
[39:00] to see then you come on up to the Wesley
[39:03] the Methodist the Baptist the
[39:04] Presbyterian and on up coming into the
[39:07] Pentecostals OFA Street you know 1906
[39:11] and you see then the oness because of
[39:12] zusa street was
[39:14] trinitarians but the one this Doctrine
[39:16] started about 190 1912 somewhere right
[39:20] in there daddy Seymour and them begin to
[39:23] to preach the Oneness Doctrine and it
[39:26] began to develop more into the truth and
[39:29] they begin to bring back a lot of the
[39:31] truth and thank God for it that's why
[39:33] we're not against any churches people
[39:35] think we are right I believe what Martin
[39:38] Luther they started the Lutheran Church
[39:41] I believe what he T her that J shall
[39:43] live by faith now what he taught of
[39:45] other things that's I might argue with
[39:47] him about it and not believe it but I
[39:49] believe that John Wesley of
[39:51] sanctification mhm right am John Wesley
[39:55] was a missionary if you remember came to
[39:57] America to convert the Heathen the
[40:00] Indians and the
[40:01] things and some Mor Arabians every how
[40:04] you pronounce it they introduced him to
[40:06] the message of sanctification right well
[40:09] when he did he went back home and he
[40:11] said lo I went to convert to Heathen and
[40:14] found out I wouldn't converted so he
[40:16] started the message of Methodist right
[40:19] you know methods of doing things that's
[40:22] right the Baptist came along with
[40:25] bringing back immersion and water
[40:29] M know they got where they is sprinkling
[40:31] everything and they started in with
[40:33] eternal
[40:35] Securities Presbyterian picked it on up
[40:37] into the eternal security forms
[40:41] predestination when as they did they
[40:43] brought it on out so we don't deny any
[40:45] church right amen we just deny the
[40:47] things man has
[40:49] taught that's
[40:52] right not against anybody but against
[40:55] the system that's caused us to do be
[40:57] wrong amen
[40:59] amen what did like one man said to me
[41:01] one day down there at work he said am
[41:04] many I talking to him about like a water
[41:06] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[41:08] Christ and they said show me in the
[41:10] Bible anybody's ever baptized any other
[41:13] way he said well all these people all
[41:15] these denominations baptized Father Son
[41:17] and Holy Ghost I said yeah but the Bible
[41:21] says Lord Jesus or Jesus
[41:25] Christ he said how many are out there I
[41:27] said well the C colone got about 50
[41:29] million at that time he said you mean 50
[41:31] million was wrong and you're right I
[41:33] said I didn't say that but I believe it
[41:36] amen so I didn't make the statement but
[41:39] I believe what you're saying is true if
[41:42] they don't believe the truth right amen
[41:44] see Jesus said You shall know the truth
[41:46] and they it'll set you free amen that's
[41:49] right but see to believe in two Lords
[41:51] you're going to have to come back to two
[41:54] Gods yep that's right
[41:58] right two Gods but why don't you come
[42:02] right down into the Simplicity of
[42:04] anything God
[42:06] created in the wound of Mary amen the
[42:09] egg and The Germ sperm whatever you want
[42:12] to call it to bring forth the Virgin
[42:15] birth right he was neither Jew nor
[42:19] Gentile
[42:21] right he was what the Bible said amen
[42:24] born this day in the city of David is a
[42:26] Savi which is Christ the Lord amen his
[42:29] name Shall be Called Emmanuel amen why
[42:32] didn't they name him
[42:35] Emmanuel go that's what he's saying
[42:37] right they didn't name him Emmanuel
[42:40] because that's what Emmanuel is Jesus is
[42:44] Emmanuel right God With Us
[42:48] right see then the one true and living
[42:51] God is simple to understand once we see
[42:53] it and why would we want to have two
[42:55] Lords and things about it
[42:58] right yeah but brother these these
[43:00] brothers are way older than you are and
[43:02] and train okay that's fine I
[43:07] don't I don't have no problems I hope
[43:10] they
[43:10] don't yeah I can still call them
[43:14] brothers that's right and fellowship
[43:16] with them but I just don't agree their
[43:18] with their Doctrine
[43:20] right Peter had a lot of problems with
[43:22] some even the apostles down through
[43:24] there are some of their
[43:26] doctor you know some of their ideas you
[43:30] had straighten them out all
[43:32] right but now the truth what how can
[43:36] they be two
[43:39] Lords that would mean two
[43:42] gods that would mean Jesus was
[43:45] God and God was God so now what you
[43:48] going to do with it when the word God is
[43:50] not even the name right amen God means
[43:54] object of worship right what's his name
[43:57] the Bible talks about his name amen
[44:00] you'll call his name Jesus
[44:03] amen Jesus is Jehovah savior you hovah
[44:06] SE going all the way back to Joshua
[44:08] coming down all the way from the
[44:09] beginning back there to come down to
[44:11] bringing to the name
[44:14] Jesus see because it's the only name God
[44:17] ever had that's right come want un quote
[44:20] scriptures right that's right I come in
[44:22] my father's
[44:24] name the Holy Ghost whom the father will
[44:27] send in my name
[44:30] mhm well then his name was
[44:33] Jesus y amen sure simple language simple
[44:37] thought how can it be two
[44:41] Lords if there is there two
[44:43] Gods any language you put it in yeah but
[44:47] you just don't understand I know what
[44:48] people say you just don't understand I
[44:50] agree with you I don't understand that's
[44:52] that's the problem I don't understand if
[44:54] I understood I wouldn't be saying what I
[44:56] said right
[44:57] I would be teaching what they believe
[45:00] right but I just can't see it amen right
[45:04] you say yeah but there's got to be one
[45:06] person of God and the other person no no
[45:08] you just can't see as I was say
[45:10] right as I said a moment ago God created
[45:13] an egg in a sperm placed it into a bared
[45:16] wound
[45:19] y cuz he the reason he came through he
[45:22] could have placed it on a rock or spoke
[45:24] it into existence and made a body he
[45:26] proved in MDC and and back there when
[45:29] Moses I mean Abraham seeing him right he
[45:33] brought a body into existence he could
[45:35] have done that but yet none of those
[45:37] were our no kinsman redeemer no that's
[45:41] right no so God created a body to be kin
[45:45] folks to human beings right amen but he
[45:47] just simply when that baby come forth
[45:49] from the womb the body was there the
[45:52] Soul and Spirit came into that body
[45:55] right simple language to me that's what
[45:57] happens to all babies right right amen
[46:01] right all babies come forth from the
[46:03] wound of the mother and God speaks right
[46:06] life into them right that's simple so
[46:09] that's what happened with Jesus amen but
[46:11] see God the Bible said God was in Christ
[46:14] reconciling the world and to himself y
[46:17] God came down and lived in the human
[46:19] flesh
[46:21] amen see they don't understand one God
[46:24] that's what the trouble is blood around
[46:26] could say Je Jehovah crying in a cradle
[46:30] y he said you're god with no teeth y he
[46:34] that's good language am little little
[46:37] baby L there that was almighty God right
[46:41] that's what the Bible say
[46:44] right we see we we try to make it some
[46:49] mystery he was born a baby he come up he
[46:53] growed 11 around 12 years old or
[46:56] something he was down in the temple
[47:00] teaching the high ranking
[47:03] official right
[47:06] right you got to admit he was a word
[47:09] because John one says he was in the
[47:11] beginning was the word word was with God
[47:13] and the Word was God verse 14 says and
[47:15] the Word was made flesh and dwelt among
[47:17] us we beheld it as the only begotten of
[47:20] the father full of grace and truth
[47:22] that's scripture
[47:24] amen but when that baby was born that
[47:27] almighty God stepped in there now here's
[47:29] what well how could God run the world if
[47:31] he's in the baby he's all he done fol
[47:34] could start with he ain't out there
[47:36] having to move every day okay tick your
[47:39] clock tick your clock tick your clock
[47:40] make it go make it go make make another
[47:42] day no he said it one time
[47:46] right let there be Seasons let there be
[47:49] a day that's it that's
[47:54] right but what what I've always loved
[47:56] about is you see we've always taught
[47:58] some form of a god
[48:00] somewhere you know Father Son and Holy
[48:03] Ghost but we could never bring it
[48:05] down and then you can say well now Jesus
[48:07] was God and they so well yeah that's
[48:09] right but now really you know that's
[48:12] what people but really wasn't God he was
[48:13] a Son of
[48:17] God a Son of God is God made make
[48:21] manifest in another form that's
[48:23] right I have two sons sitting here
[48:25] tonight they're they're my
[48:27] Sons that's me in another form you want
[48:30] to check it out run the DNA and find out
[48:33] right right righten see it's simple the
[48:36] Bible says by the things you see you can
[48:39] understand right amen but there mankind
[48:42] is trying to figure it out and he can't
[48:43] figure it
[48:44] out cuz it can't be figured out right
[48:48] it's too simple to be figured out that's
[48:50] right but you got to believe it amen
[48:53] like I was quot a while ago Jesus said
[48:55] unless you believe that I am he
[48:57] you will die in your sins that's
[49:00] right Philip come up to him one day and
[49:02] said show us the father that it suffice
[49:04] or satisfice he said Philip have I been
[49:07] so long with you and you haven't seen me
[49:10] he said if you seen me you have seen the
[49:13] father why because God was dwelling
[49:15] there in human flesh that's right at the
[49:18] age of 12 he was the word straightened
[49:20] out those people but he straightened out
[49:22] his own mother too you know the story
[49:26] right oh it's mother come up there and
[49:27] she claimed him to be a virgin birth
[49:29] right she claimed him to become a virgin
[49:32] birth but when it come to that her face
[49:34] with all of the big religious Society of
[49:36] the time what she say your father and I
[49:40] talking about Joseph right your father
[49:43] and I S you diligently read your Bible
[49:46] what did he say must he said I must be
[49:50] about my father's business you know what
[49:52] Mary shut her mouth right
[49:55] right well because she she knew she was
[49:58] denying him as to be a virgin birth yep
[50:01] and she knew he was straightening her
[50:02] out that's right and showing who he was
[50:05] that's why she ow me in the Bible that
[50:07] he ever called her
[50:10] mother come on holde me a Bible right
[50:13] now I'm not saying when he was a little
[50:14] kid I'm not saying he wouldn't that he
[50:16] didn't run around when he a little baby
[50:18] I don't know who to call you I don't
[50:19] know what to call you no I ain't
[50:22] silly when he came up to the Agee of
[50:25] understanding right he said he called
[50:28] her woman
[50:30] y when he was hanging on the cross he
[50:32] spoke to John he said John Behold thy
[50:38] mother woman behold your son
[50:43] y cuz see she wasn't his
[50:46] mother right right she was his incubator
[50:50] they proven it today because they take a
[50:52] egg out of one person a germ out of
[50:54] another what you call the word sperm and
[50:56] they put it together in a third person
[50:57] and bring forth a child y That's right
[50:59] who does it belong to right
[51:04] right but you see science proves God to
[51:07] be true corre
[51:11] amen but it see you can't have the two
[51:14] Lord now I know what the Bible
[51:17] says but even I'm just honest I say now
[51:20] cuz I don't do off on
[51:22] nobody I've never heard any of the
[51:25] brothers that's believe in the two Lords
[51:27] ever use the Psalms and the the
[51:30] scriptures there where it says the Lord
[51:32] said unto my Lord right sit down on my
[51:35] right hand I've never heard of one of
[51:36] them explain that right I'm honest maybe
[51:39] they have maybe you have I don't know
[51:41] just tell me if you have let me
[51:43] know but I never heard a one of them say
[51:46] that cuz they don't know what that means
[51:47] that's right that's correct because the
[51:50] psalmist David the Bible says in the
[51:52] spirit said the Lord said unto my Lord
[51:54] sit down on my right hand till I make
[51:56] thine enemies thy foottoo that's right
[51:59] Jesus come along in in the gospels and
[52:02] quoting that exactly same scripture and
[52:04] said who son is
[52:06] he and none of them religious leaders
[52:09] had any answer no he said if David
[52:12] recognize him to be that said whose son
[52:14] is he right
[52:16] amen see they could they they won't take
[52:19] scriptures like that but what is it God
[52:23] condescending the Lord said unto my Lord
[52:25] right amen Jesus prayed to the father
[52:28] right that's no problem yep that's no
[52:32] problem with me to see that Jesus was
[52:34] stand and pray to his father who do you
[52:36] pray to right
[52:38] amen you got the Holy Ghost inside of
[52:41] you come on you got the Holy Ghost
[52:43] Inside you by the new birth who do you
[52:44] pray to i s inside you know I just real
[52:48] I want talk to my
[52:49] father no you don't do that you pray to
[52:52] God in heaven don't you right
[52:57] but Jesus one day I like what he had say
[52:59] about it he said father he said for the
[53:02] standing by I
[53:05] say and he stopped and he screamed like
[53:08] you say he was nothing but a man we'll
[53:10] get to that in a minute he was nothing
[53:12] but a man sure he was a man when he was
[53:14] thirsty when he was hungry when he was
[53:17] dying on a tree he was a man
[53:20] yes that's right he was a man when he
[53:23] was
[53:25] weeping because Lazarus had passed away
[53:28] I don't think he's weaken because
[53:29] Lazarus passed cuz he knew it already
[53:31] passed he already told the disciples
[53:32] days before then said Lazarus is dead go
[53:35] read your Bible that Lazarus is dead he
[53:39] was weeping because he didn't understand
[53:40] what he was doing
[53:42] right
[53:44] amen but he was weeping
[53:47] there because he was a man but what
[53:50] about when he straightened him shoulders
[53:51] up as the prophet said and said Lazarus
[53:53] come forth amen Lazarus walked out out
[53:56] of there yes sir amen he was almighty
[53:58] God
[54:00] then and see that's what man tries to do
[54:02] they try to make him b sometimes and God
[54:05] sometimes man sometimes and God
[54:08] sometimes now how can you do
[54:11] that that's a split personality if you
[54:13] understand it what all those other words
[54:15] is for and see I know what the word for
[54:18] what they say that that if if if he's
[54:20] one substance and God is another one and
[54:23] you know if he's one person and God is
[54:24] another person you know what that comes
[54:25] out to be
[54:27] a demog
[54:28] God there's a word called demog God look
[54:31] in the dictionary and you get
[54:34] home d e m
[54:36] o n g o d I guess demong
[54:41] God look it
[54:44] up it means a character or something
[54:48] that is of another
[54:53] source a split personality
[54:57] yes not of the right person not of the
[54:59] same
[55:01] substance so do you believe that Jesus
[55:04] was a demog God if he was a demog God
[55:07] then he needs Redemption
[55:09] right cuz he's another person y see
[55:12] that's why that's why I say then I tell
[55:14] you why I don't believe these things
[55:15] then tell you really why because if
[55:17] Jesus was another person he needs
[55:19] Redemption amen right come on and that's
[55:22] what we read up there that Sur in this
[55:24] every had his name was that's what he he
[55:27] said that was actually his teaching
[55:31] right that Jesus would finally one of
[55:34] these days rais so you know he didn't
[55:36] believe in him rais
[55:37] it right
[55:40] sure ain't that odd that some in the
[55:42] message we'll get to that
[55:44] doctrine that don't believe in the
[55:46] resurrection of Jesus
[55:49] Christ big man in this message big
[55:52] following around the world don't believe
[55:54] that Jesus Christ raised from the dead
[55:59] right that's another Doctrine we'll get
[56:02] to say there a lot of them I don't agree
[56:04] with I tell you why I don't agree with
[56:06] that's right it a't don't just get up
[56:07] here and read them all I don't believe
[56:08] that to Lord I don't believe that to I
[56:10] don't believe that to God I don't I
[56:12] don't believe that I don't believe that
[56:14] no I try my best to explain it to where
[56:16] you allow something Amen to where you
[56:19] can hold on to a point and say well the
[56:21] reason I don't believe that are maybe it
[56:23] will expose to you what you you have
[56:27] believed
[56:30] right and we'll help you to get rid of
[56:32] it
[56:35] right 99% of what's in here tonight come
[56:38] from trinitarian background didn't we
[56:41] amen we used to believe that God in
[56:42] three person Blessed Trinity yeah
[56:48] right because all denominations teach
[56:51] that y other than the Oneness that goes
[56:53] off on the other scale of the end
[56:58] all right think about it
[57:01] then how many gods do you believe there
[57:04] is that's
[57:06] right and if you believe in a trinity
[57:08] the only thing that I want to ask you if
[57:09] anything if you believe in a trinity you
[57:11] believe in three
[57:12] Gods well then if Jesus Is My Savior
[57:18] then the father and the Holy Ghost don't
[57:20] have anything to do with
[57:23] me and I'm going to deny them as part of
[57:26] my
[57:29] salvation that's just plain
[57:32] MH see they can't be two
[57:35] Lords you said well you quoted the
[57:37] Scriptures it said the Lord said unto my
[57:39] Lord that's exactly
[57:43] right but we know how the story started
[57:45] in Genesis that almighty God when his
[57:48] word the name God wasn't even in it's
[57:50] not even a word it was called Elohim
[57:53] right that's the greatest closest thing
[57:55] they can get to the fact of
[57:57] understanding the words for God is
[58:00] Elohim which means self-existing
[58:04] so there was a time he was self-existing
[58:07] he didn't exist with a father he didn't
[58:10] exist with a son he didn't exist with
[58:12] you and me he didn't exist with anything
[58:14] he was self-existing that's
[58:16] right the only way we can ever have
[58:19] anything to do with it because we could
[58:20] be in him amen right by the eternal life
[58:24] that he had that self-existing God
[58:27] you've heard the prophet explain it
[58:29] right he stepped over into another
[58:32] form and said let there be amen they
[58:36] begin to
[58:37] create it was called a Son of God the
[58:40] theologians say it in your Bible the
[58:43] logos that went out of God in the
[58:45] beginning was called the Son of
[58:47] God it means speech logos
[58:50] speech that's what he done he spoke the
[58:53] word into existence by the word right
[58:56] and the Bible said all things were
[58:58] created by Jesus Christ
[59:01] right now Jesus the flesh wasn't back
[59:04] there right Jesus the flesh was not
[59:08] Eternal it had to be made Eternal in the
[59:11] resurrection Jesus the flesh had a
[59:13] beginning right right right but God
[59:17] stepped into that
[59:19] body it's not like the other doctrines
[59:22] that come along and said that that he
[59:23] was just a man oh Lord
[59:27] all these doctrines relate right
[59:29] straight together yep that's right and
[59:31] they make fun of each other and say they
[59:33] don't believe what the other one
[59:34] says that's right this people believe
[59:37] that Jesus was not god Till The River
[59:39] Jordan there when he received when the
[59:41] Holy Ghost came down on him on the River
[59:42] Jordan said this is my beloved Son in
[59:44] whom I pleased to
[59:47] dwell they believe that's when he
[59:49] finally become
[59:51] God Lord he was just a man up until
[59:54] then and God left a man in the garden
[59:58] and let him
[1:00:00] die I got a quote in here where the
[1:00:02] prophet of God says they ain't no man
[1:00:05] can die like that man died that's right
[1:00:08] no yeah that's
[1:00:13] right come on that's sensual that you
[1:00:16] seen the movie portray what is it where
[1:00:19] they beat him so much in that movie the
[1:00:22] passion passion you've seen that movie I
[1:00:25] don't believe that was even Highway
[1:00:26] enough to show how they beat him cuz the
[1:00:29] Bible say he we didn't even want to look
[1:00:31] on there
[1:00:37] right didn't want to even look on
[1:00:41] him why because he was
[1:00:44] beaten right bruised beyond recognition
[1:00:47] as a human
[1:00:48] being for my sins and yours
[1:00:56] then man would come along and try making
[1:00:57] two or three different
[1:00:59] persons if that had been almighty God
[1:01:01] how could he have stood all of that
[1:01:03] right
[1:01:04] amen he couldn't do it right there was
[1:01:08] no way he could that a man can do that
[1:01:10] let's see if I can find that it was no
[1:01:13] man you find
[1:01:22] it which one is it and I got away my
[1:01:30] notes but he was more than a
[1:01:33] man sure he
[1:01:36] cried right but in body he was a man but
[1:01:40] in Soul he was almighty God yes sir yes
[1:01:44] almighty God or else the biggest
[1:01:46] deceiver the world ever had that's right
[1:01:49] man he died to pay the price yes his
[1:01:53] blood separated blood and water he died
[1:01:56] of a heart attack
[1:01:58] amen right right no Roman spear killed
[1:02:01] him he was already dead right the nails
[1:02:05] didn't kill him he died of a broken
[1:02:07] heart
[1:02:09] amen that was why the blood in the water
[1:02:12] would separate in him and come running
[1:02:14] out when they pierced his side
[1:02:18] together am was because he died of a
[1:02:20] broken heart that's
[1:02:22] right because he was rejected a man Man
[1:02:26] of Sorrow is acquainted with
[1:02:29] grief read the psalmist sometimes until
[1:02:32] that man get so in the spirit until he'd
[1:02:33] say they pierc my hands and my feet
[1:02:36] David and all talking just like it was
[1:02:38] doing it to him but he was prophesying
[1:02:40] what it would take place amen they
[1:02:42] wagged their tongues he said not a bone
[1:02:45] was broken you go get to your Bible and
[1:02:47] read it there was a thief on each side
[1:02:49] of him they broke their legs read your
[1:02:52] Bible when they come to Jesus they found
[1:02:55] he was already dead that's they didn't
[1:02:57] break a bone in his body why cuz the
[1:02:59] Bible had already said they' not be a
[1:03:01] broken bone
[1:03:05] right sure he was a
[1:03:09] man because he was born in human flesh
[1:03:12] right that's it as a man mhm but the
[1:03:16] prophet of God said no man was like that
[1:03:18] man amen right no man can take the sins
[1:03:22] of all mankind upon himself and go to a
[1:03:24] tree
[1:03:27] no man can die for another man to do any
[1:03:32] good people to say but my God can't die
[1:03:35] but according to the Bible mine did amen
[1:03:39] if Jesus wasn't God he was the biggest
[1:03:41] deceiver the world's ever seen and I
[1:03:42] don't mind saying that that's right
[1:03:44] right he was the biggest hypocrite ever
[1:03:47] been in the world or he was almighty God
[1:03:50] Amen now which way we want to make it
[1:03:53] yes God Amen but you see it's our ideas
[1:03:58] our thoughts we get a thought not
[1:04:00] realizing that man way back down there
[1:04:03] in the time when John was walking upon
[1:04:05] the Earth which would have had to have
[1:04:07] been Somewhere In AD 50 or
[1:04:10] something cuz he put on that patmas uh
[1:04:13] in ad 93 is that right 90 90 something
[1:04:16] like that he was put on patmas I know
[1:04:18] that's when the first church age began
[1:04:20] 93 John was taken to patmas so before
[1:04:23] John was taken to patmas and come back
[1:04:25] to right Little John this man was
[1:04:27] already teaching that Jesus was just a
[1:04:31] man
[1:04:33] y then these people come along with
[1:04:35] their doctrines and they following them
[1:04:37] around the world and just shouting like
[1:04:38] one man one said about it said if
[1:04:40] brother Brandon was here tonight said be
[1:04:41] set and listening to my pastor
[1:04:49] yeah I hate been in that building yeah
[1:04:52] that's right that's all I got to say
[1:04:56] I'm not against anybody of their
[1:04:57] thoughts about it but see God was
[1:04:59] reconciling the world unto himself in
[1:05:02] that man I've preached to you to show
[1:05:05] you MDC was a man that would
[1:05:09] eat but he that man could not die for
[1:05:12] our sins why because he was just spoken
[1:05:15] into existence right right right he had
[1:05:18] to be king folks he had to become
[1:05:20] inhuman
[1:05:22] flesh he had to be according to the Book
[1:05:24] of Ruth my kinsman redeemer
[1:05:29] amen I was born according to the Book of
[1:05:31] Ruth I was born one with one more Coos
[1:05:33] or kin to me which was the devil amen
[1:05:37] you and I were born in the devil's
[1:05:39] domain you say you come here with
[1:05:41] eternal life all you want to you better
[1:05:43] realize that Jesus Christ had to die to
[1:05:45] release that life right if he had died
[1:05:48] to release that life you can't have
[1:05:50] eternal life without his death right and
[1:05:52] why did he die then if we could have
[1:05:53] eternal life without him yeah
[1:05:57] right but you see they believe that he
[1:05:59] become G that Jesus become God on the
[1:06:01] River Jordan I agree that he was
[1:06:03] anointed on the River Jordan I agree
[1:06:05] with that I've always preached
[1:06:07] it this ain't
[1:06:09] new always preached we had ministers
[1:06:12] meetings back in the early ' 80s about
[1:06:13] these things that's what I spoke then
[1:06:16] just what I'm saying now sure he was he
[1:06:19] was born a
[1:06:21] man amen but you better remember that
[1:06:24] was the body of God amen right you
[1:06:27] better believe that God created that
[1:06:29] body that it didn't come from
[1:06:31] Mary now neither did it come from Joseph
[1:06:34] right amen cuz he' been perverted just
[1:06:37] like ours amen that's
[1:06:39] right but he was born
[1:06:43] yes a man amen sure but then that
[1:06:48] man inside of that man was the Soul and
[1:06:51] Spirit of almighty God amen amen that's
[1:06:54] right living with us what are we going
[1:06:57] to see when we get to
[1:06:59] heaven if these people are right then
[1:07:01] we're not going to see
[1:07:04] Jesus and according to my Bible even
[1:07:07] when we get over in the Book of
[1:07:08] Revelations you'll find out that there
[1:07:10] won't be no City there and there won't
[1:07:13] need be no need of the light because the
[1:07:16] lamb the one that was introduced on the
[1:07:19] River on the River Jordan the lamb is
[1:07:23] the light of the city amen
[1:07:26] now we don't believe in Eternal sunship
[1:07:28] cuz there's no such thing that's a
[1:07:30] Catholic doctrine of Eternal sunship
[1:07:32] right we don't believe in Eternal
[1:07:34] sunship but there one thing for sure
[1:07:36] Sons and Daughters of a living God can
[1:07:38] be Eternal amen
[1:07:40] right y that body of Jesus was not
[1:07:45] sinful but according to the Future home
[1:07:47] of Liv it had to be
[1:07:49] redeemed right why because it had a
[1:07:51] beginning anything has a beginning got
[1:07:53] to have an ending to it amen that's
[1:07:55] sensible right amen his body was not
[1:07:59] Eternal when he was here on this
[1:08:01] Earth but it was made Eternal in the
[1:08:04] resurrection amen now you separated from
[1:08:06] his
[1:08:09] body around and said he he pour that
[1:08:14] that soul and all out of that body yep
[1:08:17] why because he just simply Ste out of it
[1:08:19] right that's it right they didn't kill
[1:08:22] him he stepped out of the body that's
[1:08:25] right
[1:08:26] they laid the body in the grave he so
[1:08:28] the BBL that went down and preached to
[1:08:30] the souls that were in prison Spirits in
[1:08:32] prison right and he came back up in the
[1:08:36] resurrection picked that body
[1:08:38] up and when mared him seen him they
[1:08:41] didn't recognize him why he was turned
[1:08:43] back to a young man right
[1:08:47] right well because he wasn't old anymore
[1:08:50] that's right amen well he was here in
[1:08:52] the world the Bible said he looked like
[1:08:53] he's 50 he looked like an old man when
[1:08:55] he was only like 33
[1:08:58] right you see he's either G or the
[1:09:00] biggest deceiver it's ever been that's
[1:09:03] right yeah that anointing came on him on
[1:09:06] the River Jordan amen made him then the
[1:09:09] fullness of the godhead bodily right
[1:09:12] amen but it didn't make him no more
[1:09:16] God headstone supposed to unite with you
[1:09:19] one of these days isn't it does it make
[1:09:21] you any more a child of God than the new
[1:09:22] birth does no no
[1:09:28] but you see then what happens is we get
[1:09:31] our concept and our thoughts but brother
[1:09:33] we've got so many thousand quotes I told
[1:09:35] you 40 years ago about the S old
[1:09:39] Doctrine I said if you think this is
[1:09:41] deceiving cuz they only had a few quotes
[1:09:44] they couldn't line them up amen but I
[1:09:48] said one of these days they'll be
[1:09:49] quoting brother random to the letter oh
[1:09:52] yeah
[1:09:53] sure you want to contact the man up here
[1:09:56] up the road and talk to him about
[1:09:57] whether Jesus was God in the River
[1:09:59] Jordan he'll give you about 2,000
[1:10:06] quotes go ahead
[1:10:11] BL the trinitarian concept of mankind
[1:10:14] has had so many thousands of years and
[1:10:17] is developed as a trinity you want to
[1:10:19] believe
[1:10:20] it the Bible says there just one God
[1:10:23] Amen there's one sitting on on the
[1:10:25] throne amen it would no three that come
[1:10:27] back and lived in me it's one God I know
[1:10:30] three persons Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:10:32] came back in the person of the baptism
[1:10:34] of the Holy Ghost yes to live in each
[1:10:36] one of us by the new birth amen right my
[1:10:39] father is living inside of me right now
[1:10:42] amen because that is a new birth
[1:10:46] amen you see these doctors all tie
[1:10:48] together and they and and it shows that
[1:10:50] they don't understand the
[1:10:53] godhead that's right if they understand
[1:10:55] stood to godhead they wouldn't have the
[1:10:56] doctrine that's right amen but they
[1:10:58] won't wait for somebody to be able to
[1:11:00] put it together they just start off with
[1:11:02] their quotes and then it sounds like
[1:11:04] it's
[1:11:05] good that's
[1:11:07] wonderful but what does the Bible say
[1:11:11] Amen the Bible said he was born Lord to
[1:11:13] Christ that's
[1:11:15] right prophet of God said the anointed
[1:11:18] became Anointed with the fullness of the
[1:11:20] baptism sure on the River Jordan amen
[1:11:24] and the garden against that anointing
[1:11:26] had to leave him because he would never
[1:11:28] have been able to die with that on him I
[1:11:30] agree amen that's right it left him but
[1:11:33] it didn't leave him no less God right
[1:11:35] sir right amen the Bible said when he
[1:11:40] died he gave up the Holy
[1:11:43] Ghost he said into thy hands I Comm in
[1:11:45] my
[1:11:47] spirit see was still almighty God even
[1:11:50] the Centurion that put him on the cross
[1:11:52] said surely he was the son of God Amen
[1:11:55] MH why did they kill
[1:11:59] Jesus wasn't because of the miracle they
[1:12:01] believed in them right they wanted them
[1:12:04] they wanted to be fed they like the food
[1:12:06] he was supplying
[1:12:08] for he said you're a man making yourself
[1:12:10] God
[1:12:12] Y is that what they said about it yeah
[1:12:14] right that you're a man making yourself
[1:12:16] God we don't believe in that he said
[1:12:19] show me where I missed the scripture
[1:12:21] right
[1:12:23] sure he said because you you that know
[1:12:26] the scriptures know that you
[1:12:29] call the son of God
[1:12:34] God boy they got upset didn't they
[1:12:38] yeah
[1:12:40] amen because they couldn't stand
[1:12:44] it that's
[1:12:48] it
[1:12:51] now if Satan is the author of The
[1:12:53] Trinity and certainly is not
[1:12:56] God what is the
[1:12:58] author of these three points we've
[1:13:01] covered tying together to Two Souls cuz
[1:13:03] you got two Souls you got to have two
[1:13:05] Gods y sensible don't need no language
[1:13:09] does it got two Lords you got to have
[1:13:11] two Lords you got to have two Gods right
[1:13:13] if he went God to the River Jordan all
[1:13:15] of same Doctrine yep I'm sure I'll hear
[1:13:18] from that but you come and show me where
[1:13:21] it's not that's right
[1:13:24] amen don't Rite me a little old thing no
[1:13:26] we don't agree with you tell me why and
[1:13:31] were you don't have to quote just come
[1:13:33] on down amen I'm just honest I want to
[1:13:36] be right
[1:13:40] yes I'm not going to back up because
[1:13:42] some little cifi something you poke out
[1:13:44] of Doctrine we'll just poke out some
[1:13:46] more with
[1:13:47] you but they don't need an arguing about
[1:13:49] it that's what they was doing at NAA
[1:13:51] they were arguing whether Jesus was God
[1:13:53] or another substance another person
[1:13:56] right y another Lord or
[1:13:59] another
[1:14:01] being and not of the same substance
[1:14:05] right and even they themselves wrote the
[1:14:07] n and Creed to condemn that
[1:14:12] yeah you just read the naan
[1:14:16] Creed they condemn that
[1:14:19] Doctrine but the ideas had already been
[1:14:21] set into man's mind that's it and it
[1:14:24] didn't take long until it began to be a
[1:14:26] a great major
[1:14:28] Doctrine all right it held out pretty
[1:14:31] good I'm quoting history it held out
[1:14:32] pretty good until Constantine passed
[1:14:36] on and his son is constantinus or
[1:14:39] something close to it yeah his son took
[1:14:41] over and it held out pretty good under
[1:14:47] him but yet then when others came in
[1:14:50] then it was Hey Day from then on and you
[1:14:53] had the dark ages of the Catholic Church
[1:14:55] right for over a thousand years they
[1:14:58] ruled the world with their doctrines
[1:15:01] amen and then a denomination started
[1:15:03] coming out of that but what did they
[1:15:06] do Martin Luther come out of the saying
[1:15:09] the just shall live by faith but what
[1:15:10] did the Lutheran church do they started
[1:15:12] burning down the buildings and things
[1:15:15] that Christian people so-called so
[1:15:18] fought against the Catholic Church they
[1:15:19] were burning down the Catholic churches
[1:15:22] and Luther said I didn't teach that
[1:15:25] right what did the buildings have to do
[1:15:27] with
[1:15:28] it it was against the people not the
[1:15:33] buildings you see we think so much that
[1:15:35] we're
[1:15:37] right but where's Jesus in the whole
[1:15:44] thing where's he adding the whole point
[1:15:46] where's he lifted up exalted that's
[1:15:49] right that's right to the
[1:15:52] throne no he's demoted
[1:15:56] brother R preached a message I know one
[1:15:57] for certain say raising Jesus from
[1:16:00] history the very
[1:16:05] title see that's all I'm trying to do is
[1:16:07] raise him up from a historical God to a
[1:16:10] reality in our hearts and lives Amen to
[1:16:14] see Jesus Christ Living in me and you
[1:16:16] right yes in the new birth to bring us
[1:16:19] to be the Sons and Daughters of a living
[1:16:22] God and to one day take and change these
[1:16:25] bodies that we live in
[1:16:29] yes yep because that's another
[1:16:32] Doctrine even in this message not just
[1:16:35] organized religion organized religion
[1:16:36] always talk you going to get a new
[1:16:39] body right you show me in the Bible
[1:16:41] where you going to get
[1:16:43] one all I want is the Bible for
[1:16:46] according to my Bible Jesus raised with
[1:16:47] nail prints in his hand amen right and
[1:16:50] that's according to the Bible man amen
[1:16:53] when you either believe that or not
[1:16:57] he told him to put your hand here put it
[1:16:59] here
[1:17:03] right see it just won't tie it with the
[1:17:07] Bible he took men and they lost their
[1:17:09] lives and all the down through of the
[1:17:11] history of this Bible to bring it down
[1:17:13] to us to where we can have the
[1:17:15] understanding that's right and then we T
[1:17:17] it and tire it up and turn all the
[1:17:19] pieces with our human Concepts and ideas
[1:17:23] right well don't you think we have a
[1:17:25] right that's what Eve said in the
[1:17:28] garden Eve said I
[1:17:31] think got this thing
[1:17:35] started don't you think we need to think
[1:17:37] we need to think what the Bible says
[1:17:39] right
[1:17:41] yeah well you think you're the only one
[1:17:43] that's got the truth I didn't say
[1:17:48] that I believe around the world there
[1:17:50] are people who has the truth right sure
[1:17:53] right
[1:17:55] that's right this ain't no small
[1:17:56] following around the world they had over
[1:17:58] a million people in Africa alone that
[1:18:00] follows this
[1:18:02] message well over a
[1:18:04] million in Africa
[1:18:07] alone United States would multiply be as
[1:18:10] much as 2 or
[1:18:15] 300,000 we're not in this one little old
[1:18:17] thought right we're people that are
[1:18:20] following the end time Amen to bring it
[1:18:23] down to the truth that's right yes amen
[1:18:25] you see God made manifest Among Us amen
[1:18:28] yes Lord you understand what I'm saying
[1:18:31] see I just put them all in one L that's
[1:18:35] it there's no difference in Two Souls
[1:18:37] than there is in two Lords and there is
[1:18:39] and believeing Jesus wouldn't go out to
[1:18:41] the River Jordan they all the same
[1:18:42] Doctrine that's right
[1:18:46] identical I'll hear from that
[1:18:48] one it's all
[1:18:51] right all right but I believe it amen
[1:18:55] but like I say come and show me
[1:18:58] amen well you're just too stubborn well

[1:19:04] am but come show me in the
[1:19:08] Bible I give you so many Quotes come
[1:19:10] give me the Bible right that's it right

[1:19:16] turned back to the Bible I believe that
[1:19:20] man I thought that brother brand never
[1:19:23] come to give us a new Bible no problem
[1:19:25] right he never come to interpret this
[1:19:27] Bible right right cuz it doesn't need
[1:19:29] interpreting right he come to tell us
[1:19:32] what it said right we read it and
[1:19:35] thought there was three gods in
[1:19:37] it that's right but then when you see
[1:19:39] the truth and read it you see they can't
[1:19:40] be but

[1:20:58] them
[1:20:59] deeper amen into the word that's right
[1:21:02] he not only reminded them of what he
[1:21:04] said he took them deeper and they wrote
[1:21:06] their letters from what the thoughts
[1:21:09] that he had given them right Peter
[1:21:11] saying one day he said I've been up the
[1:21:14] mountain with the Lord Jesus he was
[1:21:15] there in Matthew
[1:21:17] 17 on the Mount of transfiguration right
[1:21:21] he saw that and and heard the words
