then we'll go to hosea then back to isaiah 59 all right for thus verse 15 for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabited eternity whose name is holy i dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite now listen look where god dwells we think he dwells up in heaven now look where he says he dwells right said his name was holy i dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones for i will not contend forever neither will i be always wrought for the spirit should fail before me and the souls which i have made all right now let's go over to hosea and we'll go to chapter 6 verse 1 and 2. come and let us return unto the lord for he hath torn and he will heal us he has smitten and he will bind us up after two days will he revive us in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight let's go on to the next you might not have it affirmative but he shall know and follow on to know the lord is going forth his preparedness the mourning and he shall come forth unto us as to rain as the latter and former reign unto the earth now we're back in isaiah 59 and we'll read verse 19 and 20. so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him and the redeemer shall come to zion now if you're reading over in in romans it says out of zion all right which is the bride and and the redeemer shall come to zion and unto them that turn from transgression in jacob saith the lord you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word um brother aaron you might need to at least click us a fan it's hard to do in this time of the year we're up and down and air conditioning parts don't work and i've told them to put back on one of those thermostat things where i can come out and operate it because i'm just sorry i don't have the ability to figure out all this new fang dangle stuff you know but come over there and at least put some fan running now i want to talk about something this morning that i believe is a very important matter for us to understand but if we don't uh get the entire story uh i believe we will miss the truth of it of course i believe it's that way throughout the scripture all of the word is that way it's not just one scripture or one thought or one doing it's connected with all things that it must be put together because you can take anything you want to a quote a thought and you can have your own idea and that's basically what people do and i was thinking you know there the other day then while i was hunting uh and i wrote i had these notes written at home as kind of a lineup and i had to tire them up and change it over because i was sitting on a deer stand and you know and the lineup came as to kind of how to bring it apart and i got looking for something to write on i couldn't find no paper and all of my stuff i carry with me i couldn't find nothing you know brother random that wrote on gun stocks and and wrote on a rifle boxes cartridge boxes and all i wound up writing notes on flagging tape you know didn't see many deer but i got a whole line of flagging tape and brought it home because i knew if i didn't i would forget maybe the lineup that was coming to me as to how to present what i was talking about i want to talk about a revival and i know immediately there it goes internets of course to you on the internet hi how you doing somewhere at home today but ray said he'd be watching us but you know to all of you here automatically you have already by now considered your thought even just two minutes or one minute of talking as to announcement of what i was saying you have already crystallized your thoughts upon what you believe and and uh i was thinking about the fact of waiting them going to the minister's meeting and uh you know i wonder if you asked a question how many people came to the meeting praying for god to speak to their heart i'd say 99.9 maybe a little more but came with intentions of speaking what they believed all right and they did they do but see instead of praying even for the speaker you come already set to what you're doing all right brother brown said people won't listen to what you're saying they're listening to refute what you're saying well you've already immediately mean me mentioning that i want to speak on a revival you've already set your mind to a point that uh instead of saying well now let me pray for this to where that maybe it will bring out something to open my eyes you've automatically done set to where you'd like to take over the service and explain what you believe yeah okay might be a surprise you know to listen and that's what i say if you cut your mind off see you'll never listen you won't pay any attention to what's being said you're only wanting to refute that and you're so religiously superior to you want to get up and explain it because you got it right well you remember one day we would have got up and run to the altar and tried to explain a trinity right because that's what we believed but then after a while maybe now we wouldn't run up so quick you know so then listening is my point forgive me for that blunt statements but i i know the human mind and how we do and things like that but i want to talk about a revival and before we even get into anything i want to remind you that if you'd look in the message and run in the word revival i really didn't look to see how many notes there were quotes they were but there's many things spoken about a revival a revive or whatever all right and see you can have a revival just in one service and brother brandon will speak of just a little short series of meetings this little revival we've had down here at uh you know maybe some statement or some place all right and he then he'd take it as a great sweeping thing then he would speak of it in many other ways and see we can say well you know which one's right well let's see if we can discuss that to the point or think about it as to what would do and i know even the scripture that i read it said after two days in the third day well okay now we should have known because we were looking for 2 000 years to end the thing up which would have been two days well we're already in the third day right because you've done past over your 2000 years so you're in the third day so the bible's right it's just our thoughts back in the 60s 70s 80s or something we would have swore that it would have never passed the year because that's two two days you know and we couldn't do that you know but we'll try to get into the point now a revival signifies a move of god in power i'll read that in just a second of what it uh you know is doing and uh but now let's read 1a i've got that so i told them which way to go the message expectations and uh think about what the prophet has to say and if we for slow reading today i intend to read slow even if it takes both services to bring this out look what he says a minister cannot bring a revival there's no preacher can bring a revival okay he doesn't pack it with him the only thing he can do is just be loyal to god in his word and the revival has to come by the people right in your home in your life now revival isn't adding new members to the church it's reviving that what we've already got to revive means to bring back all right now we've no that in the baptist church when we'd say we're going to have a revival and revival is not to sinners you can't revive a sinner you got to get him saved before you can revive him so we knew that but the revival would be then the after effects of getting the people straight that were already in the church would bring forth salvation to a lot of people because you know it would bring a move in things so just remember now a revival signifies a move of god in power all right now so let's go and read but don't forget now as i said you go on and read and you say i've got this quote well all right i'll try my best to read it if not you let me know later and i'll be glad to read it because i want to be right but i want us to think about something is it possible to have a revival and nobody know it but you is it possible for there to be a revival for the bride only that would not have any relationship to the world all right and see in those things then we can find our answer to the quotes that he brings and like i said you read it you say well i've looked it up he said it 300 times revival well that's good and a lot of that was speaking of just our series of services a little revival he said we've had here at the tabernacle you know but you know it still meant when he's using the word revival it means the same thing a reviving of those that are already born again all right and it means a move of god in power all right now would you think in this day that there would be anything that could be related to a revival in our day you know what would you think well brother dale i got it 1956 revival's over well i got one in 63 that it ain't started yet so now which one do you want all right you see that's where we think we know all about it we get our mindset when maybe we ought to listen to the person brother molten myself years ago we used to check out a lot you know about people out in the message things and they'd be saying that brother's wrong that brother's wrong well you know that was the ones we went and listened to because if everybody was against them we figured they might have at least a little bit so you know so we'd run and listen to it all right but now look what he says see no one person can bring a revival he said well that's contrary to quote so and so because that revival of the azusa street was credited to start with one man that's right revivals were started in in uh swiney knox or one of one of them by a lady cleaning the pew all right and praying for the people and all like that but just remember that one person can't do it it would have to move out into others before it would have any effect all right so now go to number one and let's look and just read and see what your prophet had to say this is taken from the page 70 of the ephesian church age which is a church age book i want to carry this thought all the way through so let us go a step further have you ever studied the history of revivals now revival signifies a move of god in power and every time god moves satan is there to move also it never fails in the days of the great welts revival and most people don't know this the insane asylums filled up quickly and there was a great display of devil power to take away the attention from god it is written that in wesley's day the people would do most peculiar things that were definitely of satan to try to mark the goodness and power of god in luther's day it has said that the miracle of his ministry did not lie in the fact that he successfully protested the roman catholic church but the miracle lay in the fact that he could and did stay sound and sane amidst the fanatics who were often filled with and guided by wrong spirits and if you have been aware of this last day ministry you will have noted the same invasion of faults and wicked spirits it has to be that way now i hope and trust you are spiritually spiritual minded enough to get that and capitalize on it all right see we make our thoughts of a revival is to be that oh everybody would see it and there's been some revivals we'll cover that but if you couldn't read that right there and think that this age is the most or where we're at right now is the most definite signs that a revival is going on i think you're blind don't mean eyesight 2020s i think you're spiritually blind to just read that because what is a revival it's a power move of god and power all right and then to prove that god is here doing it every age had the insane asylums filled up well if you're not very familiar with what's going on today i would think that if i was you brother branham called it not insanity in the assigned asylum he said it's on the very streets so if there's any sign that you want to place anything on i believe you're to place this thing on the bases and step you're in your mind that says this is the greatest revival that has ever been because it's the greatest signs and doings of satan that has ever been amen right all right see then that order settled that part without even a thoughts of anything else because number one what god moves satan moves right all right so in the days of luther god moved satan moved there's a wesley pentecostal in this ministry of the last days all right well see then i think that we're in the greatest signs of a revival that could ever ever be because of the way satan's doing right he's on every way he's doing everything he can to fight truth look at the people of the message how they're going look at the things that are transpiring among the what we call believers the devil's gone on vacation he's he's gone taking a rest somewhere because he's not needed to fight the people because he's got all the preachers and remember the bible says he has ministers and the bible says they are ministers of righteousness they're not legalistic law teachers a preacher of righteousness is one who tries to preach righteousness as a form of being right is that the quote well see then think about it think about that point and consider it consider the fact that if satan is so prevalent today and the maniacs the craziness of the streets and the people and the way they're doing you know till they just go out and just just kill a bunch of people you know they don't care and it's insanity right down the highway they're going to run you off the road how much do we need to think about how insane this generation has gone well now according to the bible that i just read it no we're supposed to believe the bible according to where we just read in isaiah 59 it says when the enemy comes in like a flood what did it say god would do so we see the enemy but i don't know where god's at he's just not here all right you're with that man it was down in the ages it said how could god fold his arms you know and remember him i think it was joe lewis what it was the name not the boxer it was another and he said where was god well is that what it is today here in lula georgia is it where is god that's why wednesday night i had you to testify and i hope it was on the internet for people to do and i asked a question i said how many people's been healed in this 40 something 41 this is 42 i think sermon of this series and they would i think i call 15 hands that went up all right but yeah we don't see nothing going on well that's really a good answer right i should be able to just quit right now go sit down and say forget it and say we're in the greatest revival that has ever been. and you said i am because the proof has already been there but that won't do no good all right so we'll go through the best we can with other things to try to help you but remember come back to that all right now think about what is being said i asked some questions the other day to some about this and i mentioned it in one message if you believe that there's going to be now listen real carefully if you believe that there's going to be a worldwide sweeping revival in our day to the gentiles i believe you're wrong now did you follow me worldwide sweeping revival all right follow that line but now watch but if you're not looking and expecting a revival in our day you are wrong and in a very bad delusion of satan then we're not looking or talking about a worldwide sweeping revival all right yeah what do you think about a revival and why do you think like you do what do you think about a revival i think revival's over well why do you think that well i got a quote well good then we've got other quotes now which quote do you want he said revival is over 56 that was thus saith the lord we'll read it a minute but he said the bride ain't had a revival yet i guess that's not thus saith the lord so then we ought to consider what's being said amen instead of taking our own thoughts and locking it down and say i'd like to get up there right now and explain this no well i'll give you a chance when i finish all right now look the pentecostal people well he uses the word pentecostal even back in the baptists and things we talked about a great move of god coming you know a revival and things to come and how many people would be saved you know have you ever heard that one the denomination of believing a seven-year tribulation period basic i'm said basics now all right and uh in believing that they believe that's three and a half years of minor and three and a half years of major tribulation that's what it's called in the three and a half years of minor there's supposed to be a great sweeping revival that millions come to be saved now that's been talked about organized religion coming down he mentions pentecostals i did run it and there's relations to it but i couldn't find the the thing of doing it but i know that for myself of what we taught and what we believed because that's the reason of the seven year tribulation was three and a half years of minor and they would be people saved gentiles to be saved in that period of time and then it would come to a tribulation that you know would be to israel all right but now listen to what your prophet has to say go ahead with number two this is a message adopted in 1960 522 in the evening and he's coming down he talks about the the presbyterian talks about the you know how they believe that lutherans will come forth in the resurrection the baptist presbyterian the children will come forth in that resurrection that's the reason today people say all right now what people will say there are there'll be a sweeping revival that's what people say they'll go out here and save a hundred million pentecostals and all get saved and there'll be the rapture you're mistaken the rapture will be hundreds of thousands that's right but they'll be all made up in the six thousand years of salvation to six thousand years back all right look at the next one now this is abraham's covenant confirmed 1961 318 he's talking about showing you know the things he said most of the people that i meet are looking for some great big wide world sweeping revival that's done past we're at the end you're looking for great miracles and signs because just because they don't know the bible that's the two prophets of revelation 11 going to stop the son elijah and moses that's after the gentile church is gone see so they're looking and that's what brother branham explains to people that are looking for a great sweeping worldwide revival to be coming he said that's to israel with the two witnesses all right so then he was disproving the thoughts that people had that you know one day that there'd be a great tribulation set in and the best i could make out is a you know and trying to figure out what was being said they evidently believed in some people going up and then some people had to go through the tribulation but you know millions would be saved in the tribulation under a great world wide sweeping revival well there won't be any gentiles saved in the tribulation all right it's only to the jews all right that's only 144 000. and i know that he's covering that as a worldwide sweeping revival with great signs and wonders miracles and signs you know the sun stops the different things happens but remember there'll only be 144 thousand so there won't be no millions saved you only got 144 thousand all right now so then we're not looking at it as a worldwide sweeping revival all right so then that must be taken out of our minds as to the thought that you know that it would be this great thing to happen well there's not going to be any worldwide sweeping revival and i'll even make this statement where you'll think i'm correcting brother branham but you better listen even to the jews 144 000 it won't be a worldwide sweeping revival right it'll only be to the 144 000. so it won't be but the signs and the wonders is what people were looking for all right there'll come a time and he said not knowing the bible then they're looking for these great things to happen he said but that'll be to israel that should be settled in our minds all right now let's take some things and talk about it as i said if you're if you believe there's to be a worldwide sweeping revival to the gentiles i don't believe that i'm blunt i don't believe that i've explained that part there but if you're not looking expecting a revival in our day i believe you're wrong all right now i believe we can conclude and prove that and i wrote like this what do you think about a revival in our day and this is not something i've come up with and in the deer hunt the other day this has been my thoughts ever since i came into this message i've preached on it many times before down through time it's not a new doctrine or idea to come out because so and so said so and so this was my thoughts 40 some years ago all right and many of you know for sure that if i've said it over and over as you say brother dale are you looking for a revival in our day i'm exactly looking for a revival in our day but i explained it then i'm explaining it now not a worldwide sweeping revival no but to the bride of christ we'll give you one in a little bit or this evening we take time where brother brown said it's only for the elect all right so now somebody's going to click off go ahead and click all but remember i'm talking about a revival for the elect all right now but it must be placed in the correct order to understand all right now watch the i'll give you two quotes this way and two quotes this way all right and you make up your mind what you believe all right so let's go with number four which is christ revealed in his own word now this is 1965. if you'll notice 8 22 and 65. we take that now and compare it over with malachi 4. he promised that there would be light come again in the evening time all right now that the purpose of this is to just to get the point that we're depending upon the light to come in the evening time according to malachi 4. so go ahead and roll up you know what he's supposed to do and and notice this is at the end time that the son of man would be revealed roll it on up you can read all between to see if i missed it now there can't be so there can't be no organization left neither can there be any further advancement than what's going on right now now watch him you remember how we could spend a long time coming back to the grain coming back to the original and it would be the son of man do you remember the messages back months and months ago or look look what he says no be there be any neither can there be any further advancement than what's going on right now first you'll burn before the day breaks again the revival is over across the nation there ain't going to be no more revivals big sweeping revivals this nation never receive it you might have an intellectual gathering but i mean a spiritual revival we've seen all of it i hope you're catching it i'm saying it in such a way that i hope you get it you talk about the doing fine ministers a while ago said brother branham if i could just have the joy of the lord in my heart i said son the revival's over that's 1965. all right you say well he's saying it our revival's over well when we read that bride ain't had a revival yet now what are you going to do with that part you know but i want to read this one the word that you'll have it go to number five testimony on the c 62 if god willing i'm giving you a try now of i'm giving a try now of evangelism we know the revival's over brother i think we got heat on instead of our we need some we need some of you saying that's comfortable joyce is saying oh it feels good but some are stopping up okay come and click it we're going to get this thing fixed where i can walk over there and go pow and that thing goes to working all right because that thing is beyond my mind all right now watch what he says he said i'm going to try now of evangelism we know the revival's over everyone knows that i predicted that back in 56 watch when it would start ending now there's a reason for that he predicted it when it would start ending what 1956 because he said they'll turn down god this year i receive him and i predict they will turn him down all right watch now billy graham come back oral roberts or tommy osborne come and them said this is it america will receive it or reject it this year and they rejected it there's nothing waiting but judgment now he's talking about the united states right and you mark that down and see brother branham's right or not see if brother runs right around that's thus saith the lord we headed for it and we're going to pay for what we've done we got too much glamour in the church in hollywood and everything god's sick and tired of it the last one will come in after a while and that'll be it all right so he says the revival's over so your mind locks on that it's over all right now remember he said that in 62 talking about uh 56 you know so now let's read another one remember here's two revivals over now let's read from why christ speak 1959 1004 to evening speak and go forward that's right that's god's commission to his church we have no time to slack they say rev the revival's over it isn't over go forward it's time that pentecost watch him now it's time that pentecost is played out see that's what they're saying now remember he didn't say pentecostal that's what's so wonderful how the man in his statements in other words they say pentecost is played out it isn't until the life member of the body of christ comes in and then we leave out of here and even after that the two witnesses pentecost is still going right right but we don't read that away we just read what we want we read that pentecostal he didn't say pentecost he said pentecost look it it's time for pentecost to rise in the name of jesus christ and go forward there's no retreat there's no staying on the same ground let's move the spirit or the spirit will move on to somebody else and leave you standing you follow it do all this in your heart for god is with you all right so that one says we haven't had it yet it's not over something's going on 59 let's move but 56 he said it's over well it is to the world there'll never be another worldwide sweeping revival to the gentiles that's right right so it's over but does that mean it's over for you and i well let's wait on brother brown come back and maybe he can tell us something well i praise god and hope he hurry it up i'm not against any of that i've told you where i stand we've got a 30 40 days we can have a lot of understanding open but look what he says go on to the next one this is your e hymn preacher 1960. placing of a son take him out in a certain place have a ceremony before angels and place him positionally what he is in the body of christ and that person has the authority let me say this if you count me a fanatic from this not on that very same thing that i'm speaking of will be done that'll be a power remember what a revival is a move of god in power there'll be a power put into the church and now is coming in that the holy spirit will so anoint to people that they'll speak the word and it'll create itself right there we haven't seen powers likes coming into the church now i know it for a fact say unto this mountain and be moved don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you've said shall come to price you can have what you say it the placing of the church in position where the fullness of the power of the holy ghost comes into the church then critics mouth will be shut it'll be a short time jesus come right off the mountain went straight to calvary notice it won't last long now when we came into the message and they were talking a little bit then about the manifested sons and daughters of god and you know what most of the people said then manifested sun is going to be over in the millennium you know why because they didn't believe they could attain unto it right so they put the manifested sons and daughters here some of us are old enough to remember those days and they put it in the millennium well i kept hunting for a quote that i knew brother branham had stated and back then we didn't have the computers but you know what i found it he said we don't need manifested sons in the millennium he said we need them now so then you know that's where we come to it's according to what we believe be a short time all right are you expecting a revival let's read the next one number eight paragraph 182 from the third seal 63 320. that's what's the reason today that the revivals that we're supposed to have we have denominational revivals okay we haven't had a real steering no no no no no sir don't think we got revivals we haven't oh they got millions and millions and millions of church members but not a revival nowhere no no the the bride hasn't had a revival yet see there's been no revival there no manifestation of god to stir the bride yet see we're looking for it it will take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again he will send it he promised it now watch now she was she's dead you remember now what we were talking the other day awake thou that sleepless brother brown said that was a bride in denominations that was asleep all right well right now we read no more sweeping revivals now we've read that the bride hasn't even had the revival yet say well you've really confused me no no no no no no no i didn't confuse you i exposed you being confused i didn't confuse you i just read where the prophet said it you confused your own self all right i don't know where to try to finish her you see like i said i'll try to go as far as i can and then quit like i tried to explain while ago that brother branham mentions revival in a lot of things in a lot of ways you know he says well this revival has been going on for a week or two and then we talk about a revival it's just a short one or this revival has been going on here and he says it won't be no more the pentecostals are looking for a great sweeping worldwide revival he said there won't be no worldwide sweeping revival but have you ever seen what he said about azusa street 1906 all right let's read church choosing law for grace 61 318 number nine you can go through where he's coming down about azusa street and the things to know that for surety what we're saying is right save the time god has provided for them one of the greatest revivals talking of azusa street because that's back up above there all right that this nation has ever known now look what he's talking about azusa street and you'll see where the scriptures that have been are read three and they'll all come together in the right order i don't care when it was there's never been a revival like the pentecostal revival right wesley never had it none of them had it spurgeon calvin knox great reformers but they never had the revival like the pentecostal revival it's the greatest strength thing that struck the earth since the holy ghost fell on the dead pentecost nothing right now they got more conversions last year the church itself put more conversions than almost the rest of the churches put together you heard billy graham them talking about a long time ago azusa street that we think was a false this but remember what took place on azusa street according to the scripture the scripture says that from joel in acts that said in the last days i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and daughters will prophesy all right you can use that brother brown uses that for the pentecostal back there in the bible all right he uses it that way because it was the spirit poured out upon all flesh it was poured out back there but just remember the understanding there was 120 in the upper room the spirit wasn't poured out just upon everything in the original in the book of acts all right and remember also that even the 3000 outside it was poured upon might have been from around the world and the different things but it's not exactly the way it is when it says in the last days but it says in the last days i pour out my spirit upon all flesh your sons and daughters will prophesy your handmaids upon my children and all what azusa street fulfilled the scripture because it was poured out upon all flesh right you had a bunch that was poured out upon on azusa street that was just not like it was in the original in the book of acts and set up on your sons and your daughters in other words anointed ones come into view right you'll talk of anointed ones in the book of acts of the 120 or the 3000. but in the last days the spirit of god is poured out upon all flesh the greatest revival that has been since the original in the book of acts and your prophet said that well what was wrong the pentecostals couldn't see it because they were looking for something to be one of these days there'll be a great worldwide sweeping revival millions will be saved and the religious world was saying seven years tribulation and it'll be millions saved in that first three and a half years of tribulation you see the very people that were supposed to be resting in the revival didn't see what was going on do you understand do you understand it dire was a revival that swept the world from azusa street went around the world great things taking place could it be that we could sit right among something and not be able to see it was listening to a tape the other day going down hunting and read around and said would it be possible for someone to hear the voice of god and someone right next to him not hear it he said yes he said they didn't hear the book of acts with paul you know you know how that goes and see could it be possible that we even in this day could be as the pentecostals were looking for something to happen when your prophet said the greatest revival since the book of acts was azusa street pentecost but yet because of what they were taught and being taught they were looking out now is it the quote from the prophet what is the biggest problem with mankind looking forward to what will be looking back to what has been and failing to see what's going on now so there they were on azusa street the greatest revival that the world has seen since the day of pentecost yeah they were looking for something else well there's nothing wrong with looking for something else as long as you don't reject what you got because remember if you're looking for something else the only way you can know what that something else is is to know what you got right i never have seen a left-handed monkey range have you you ever been working in a place no chase go down and get me a left-handed monkey ranch you know well i just laughed and said well i'll go hunt for it that's a good way to get out of working and the boss comes alongs what are you doing i'm looking for a left-handed monkey wrench they told me to go look for it okay general motors you could put a fireplace in your back pocket and walk around all day and nobody said nothing but you went out of the employer your backpack you know but listen i've never seen some of those things right so i don't know what to look for you know i've never seen a left-handed monkey right so i don't know what to look for he said well just turn it over well i know that but my point is what if you don't have something with inside of you to know what it is what good is it doing for you to go looking i'll put this in and then we'll get into this evening because i'll just close it if you don't have the new birth which is the greatest revival to an individual he said well now wait a minute because you revive and you you said well go revive us to yeah well let's get the new birth but then after you get to new birth you know what a revival is because you know where you was revived or saved and you know what it is to climb up the pyramid right all right but think about it the greatest revival and yet people are looking out from warsaw let me give you one more then we'll quit on that part okay go number 10. he says taking go awake jesus 1963. see i hope you follow me on what i'm saying because see we start off with a 65 quote revivaled over we drop down to a 56 quote you know or talk about a 56 and says revival's over then we take a 63 in the middle and says it ain't come yet well now the man was massively confused or he was saying something that would be hidden from the eyes of the wise and prudent but we would be revealed to those who had had an that's experience and know what to look for brother are you looking for a great why why no no but i've always looked for a revival because i've always been in one all right look what he says and i think that a whole lot applies to this time where we're at living revival that we just been through now that's a compound because remember you're getting up in 63. i'll cover it this evening there's two revivals you got to consider to overlap them or you'll miss the whole point brother brown is making revival that we've just been through this pentecostal revival great healing revival that shook the entire world around just think revival fires is burning on every hill over the world around and around the world i travel it constantly fixing to make another world tour in every land and every nation the revival fires of pentecost is burning the presbyterian are receiving it the baptist the lutheran the methodist is sure it surely is the last watch that when god is calling his people in these great fires of revival are burning zeus street revival because remember one thing and we'll pick it up this evening if it is a revival it has no end if it is a revival from god it has no end it's just you got to know which way to go and what's going on do you understand what i've brought so far then that we're not looking for a worldwide sweeping revival no and even to the jews it won't be a worldwide sweeping effect but it's called that because of the great signs and wonders that will transpire of the clothes and the sun the stars of things happening all of the different things to israel but the key is it'll be just to them there'll be no revival for a gentile they won't be one gentile saved in the tribulation why because they rejected it when it ended a gentile dispensation there will be no more salvation for gentiles all right it goes to the jews he's not dealing with two different two nations at the same time then he's dealing with israel in her revival through those two prophets great things will take place but people have looked at that you know and thought well that's what's coming that's what's coming brother branham even relates it i got it on the desk at the home there he even relates he says that something compared and he says israel will see him coming after the bride and think that he's coming after them so evidently something must be going to be transpiring all right so we'll stop right there and just leave that because if i continue i'll go to 12 31 o'clock all right we'll end it there and we'll start this evening i'll give you time to think give you time to consider that your prophet will say the revival's over then he'll say you ain't even had one yet but all along he says no more sweeping revivals worldwide yet he drops back to azusa street and i'll give it to you ahead of time he brings in himself as the great revival that he spearheaded that has went around the world what are we going to do with that where you and i going to come out of it i'll give you one life statement then we'll quit the prophet said the pastor can't bring a revival one preacher can't but he says the people can all right martin luther protested the catholic church the catholic church wasn't upset with him about it but when the people began to follow after what luther was saying they got highly upset a revival started in the people because of what the man taught i want you to understand one thing i am not talking about brother dale going to spearhead a revival in the end time i hope you followed the lineup this evening brother branham has already spearheaded this revival now if one person catches it it's got to catch on somewhere and then i'll just contend i'm one of them and i'll contend it all the way down through here that i've been looking for a revival but i've been right in the middle of it too having a good time i sit there on a deer stand sometimes i'll go through three tapes that thing they made for me years ago i wore that thing out and wore it out and wore it out i just put it in because it's going to be looking you can you know three tapes sometimes just rotate one thing it keeps me awake one thing it passes time real good but then sometimes i just get something and i take out my little flagging tape and start writing on the side of it you know i thought as long as i get the thought and get a lineup don't worry about the rest of it they'll come into view but come on musicians see i'm myself i have never been down and out about the revealing of god's word and i could say it without any remorse of anything and it's been god to do it now i haven't followed after all of these two souls two lords seventh under virtue of prusions river jordan all these doctrines and it's been god it ain't been me but i'm gonna say i haven't done it and i'd like for somebody to come show me i have they just never been able to put me in a camp nowhere i just don't fit in well you know why because i just can't find the god there that i know i'm sorry you know but i just want to be me and that'll take care of everything right go ahead brother what we've got let's take them anybody have a need 654 anybody have an aide it's beginning to rain rain hear the voice of the father he's saying whosoever will come drink of this water he's promised to pour if you're thirsty and dry look up to the skies he's saying whosoever will come drink of his water he promised to pour his spirit out on his sons and his daughters if you're thirsty and dry look up to the sky think about he said this is not the latter rain he said because you haven't had the former ray he played around messages in the form of rain but the quickening of that it's a lighter rain take it up to him and think about it it's beginning to rain hear the voice of the father he says he promised to pour his spirit out on his daughter if you're thirsty and dry look that are already born again people that are letting me in that revival and you know what then they'd be revived hear the voice of the father he says on his sons and his daughter think about it former rain ladder rain great something was going on that prophet knew what it was but how could he explain it when the people couldn't even see that their pentecostal revival of azusa street was the greatest the world why couldn't they return to that no they had something out younger they thought was coming well that's wonderful but when we found out that's not for them so what good is it to look for something to come that doesn't belong to you i love the scripture behold i send you elijah the prophet but around his wife wondering where to marry him or not the voice spoke to her and said behold i send you elijah the prophet you know what she wasn't right i don't marry that guy why because she knew what that was in relation you knew that that fellow had spoke about it enough there had to be something about him that was related to it so he said okay i'll just go marry elijah right you see church we ain't you know we're missing our goal we're missing our what's going on because we already preconceived in our ideas and thoughts that's just seeing that as you leave and thinking about it it's beginning to rain he it's beginning foreign
