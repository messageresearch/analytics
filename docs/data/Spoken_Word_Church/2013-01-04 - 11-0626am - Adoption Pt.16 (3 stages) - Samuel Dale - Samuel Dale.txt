Ephesians 1 Romans 8. amen good to see you about in the house the Lord I've noticed some missing today because of the going to the youth camp and thanks we just remember them as they're traveling and all in remember Sister Barbara uh she called and she's got a problem with shingles and I'll show you this something like that you pray for because you know you know what it is that's right and all of it it's a bad thing about to have Brother Gary back with it and operational appreciate God taking care of him and remember now this coming weekend starting Saturday seven o'clock we will be having

1971 but we're you know we're having to have the services on Saturday and Sunday and brother Keith Reed will be preaching for us so remember that just just keep in mind also then the Bible study will

Sunday dinner now will be catered the word that wait in June's going to cook it for us but it'd be a catered meal and there is a list downstairs of what it's going to be on the refrigerator so you

just enough to get us through that part or or whatever we need okay and is that all announcements I always miss something so but just remember that amen Ephesians 1 and Romans 8. father we thank you for this day and the hour that we're living we thank you for the opportunity to be able this day to just sit back and relax a little bit and wait upon you and come together to hear about you because that's our desire we desire to to serve you in this day and time and we know around the world things are getting in bad shape and all but that's in your word that says it would be there we're not one that looks forward to these things but we look at them in reality and see that they are hold it they will be there and it will be so we just pray that you'll give us Grace to stand in the day that we have upon the Earth in our time because our brothers and sisters have stood the test of their time and Lord now is our time to stand our test in time so pray we pray your bless each one God each one now be with the sick among us you promised it you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe that and just have your way now and keep us in Jesus name amen Ephesians one we've been reading this for a while we're maybe the Lord with him by Wednesday we can kind of finish up on what we've been doing on this but not a promise just a thought maybe we'll get to it by Wednesday all right Mercury blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ now remember there's never been a people predestinated unto this way that we're talking about adoption you know and we're reading Romans 2 we have to understand the Redemption of the body nobody's been been predestinated this but you and I are predestinated that's right that's where we're at all right having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved I'll go back to Romans we'll just read Romans 8 23 22 for we know that the whole creation groans and trevaleth and pain together until now and not only they but ours ourselves also who have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the Redemption of of our body you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now remember what we're trying to bring now in the thought we will repeat this in a minute but see it's if you and I don't get the understanding now this is the whole message so if you miss it and something this is what I'm trying to get you to see if we don't get the understanding of the Redemption of the body or a revelation of it then there will not be a Redemption of the body I believe that all right because that's the same thing for healing same thing for salvation same thing for all things that we receive from God because we must receive them by faith by faith we'll see maybe we might have a visitor back there with us and so we're glad to to have him and we say to you welcome and then you come back again you just part of us so we we say welcome to you you know we appreciate it appreciate all of the people on the internet system and all that are there watching and we'll eventually sometime watch and see we pray that God will speak to you and open our understanding but now as I said we were talking about to wit the adoption to it now we've covered adoption in three stages that's what we're talking about you receive a new birth all right and that's when we're adopted into the family of God making us the children of God and then we uh you know we go from that to a position of of uh the same thing as the Lord Jesus did when he came to the Mount of transfiguration to the point of hear ye him and and coming to that place and then the third stage of adoption come into the place that to understand the Redemption of the body then it can take place and there's never as I said there's never been a age that was concerned about the the bodily Redemption our bodily you know doing anything with these bodies right it's never been until this age all right see but that we we see that this age is the age of that and that God has been so uh wondrous to us to to reveal these things to us and to show us in his word and you know like we we talk about Malachi 4 most people will just take Malachi 4 and they they deal with it in a basis of of blood around them to come and and we believe that amen but the scripture there says that the son of righteousness would rise with healings in his wings all right see and then we shall grow up as a calves of a stall which is stored up food all right we'll see then and what I try to get you to see Wednesday that healing campaign that started back in the early part of brother Brown's Ministry there in the 30s and as he began to go forth and and there was a healing campaign and and you you may not understand the way I say things but I I try to get you to think about something but see I believe God was showing back there that he was going to redeem these bodies all right because he would send forth a worldwide sweep of healing campaign to show that see no Divine Healing The Prophet said no Resurrection that's right all right so God was showing to the world that they would actually be a resurrection and watch that in a minute when we we get down to a point you say well we've all believed in the resurrection but how do you believe in it watch that in a minute now as we come back to the point with that but just to to hold that point but see no Divine Healing I gave you a couple of quotes back you know but I do these a lot of times for college knows on the internet and and things like that and they they don't hear the whole story but the prophet said on the angel of the Lord 1951 718 he said there's no no Divine Healing you know then there's no Resurrection he said of course Divine Healing is the earnest amen of the redeemed body now I gave you a lot of quotes where he was talking about that the Divine Healing is an Earnest of a glorified body all right see he said now no Divine Healing then no Resurrection right right all right see people didn't you know they didn't understand and they said well we're not to do this you know we're I know who the prophet said we're not to Major on a minor right all right but that was the Day and The Time amen right because that was to attract the tension of the people to get them to hear the message right that was going to be brought but God so gracious showed by healing people you know if you've seen the picture of that uh Florence Nightingales every one of her granddaughter or somebody in their family but anyhow the picture of the girl that was standing there were legs or just maybe you know this big and she's down to like 90 pound or 60 pound or something and and God healed her right you know well see then the world couldn't deny the healing but how did we look at it you say well we've always looked I'll repeat this in a minute even job looked for a resurrection right right always look for a resurrection that was the argument between the Pharisees and the Sadducees I don't understand the Sadducees except that the Sadducees of this message the way they believe it but you know all right because you know all right I don't make lie about it see a lot of people say the sad you know well I don't care about that I'm talking about the difference in their doctrine that the Sadducees didn't believe in the resurrection right right see so then I don't know what they believed right maybe it's like a lot of people today maybe I'm sure they believed in some form over Resurrection all right some form of something or either just put off to another world and you know get a new body or whatever we do but brother random says you can't preach hidden life 1956-13 you cannot preach salvation to the soul without preaching bodily healing you can't preach salvation you can't break the atonement the same same atonement that said five Stripes I'm Healed says there's wounded for our transgressions you know the stripes were healed it's the same atonement right right so we're going to believe in in Salvation for the soul but the doctors will take care of the body Now where's that in the Bible come on brother when there's more dying every day from that and we thank God for the doctors and and all like that and then and we we don't say don't go to them or nothing I went just the other day and and the doctor he got through and running coming there and he listened to my heart and he said Sam he said you got an irregular heartbeat and I said well I should have drank a cup of coffee a while ago that's probably what it is he looked at him and said I think we better run a cardiogram on you she went okay but it was the coffee you know like that to it so he goes out and they come in and they run this you know the cardiogram or what you call it EKGs or whatever all those words I never didn't understand them but anyhow they put all this stuff on them and he'd come back in a little bit he said well I guess it was the coffee EKG or what it was that it showed everything to be normal I said well you know how it is but that's let the doctor tell you everything's okie dokie then you don't have to worry about it you know that way your your mind went well oh god well I got this and remember me Tuesday I got to go he said my thyroids got to order on it or something like that but I don't give a hoot because I I've lived all these years with all of the things that's in my body and I'm 71 so I ain't worried about all these things it's October Richard this morning Wilson I said I don't go every day looking forward to something I just go every day realize they're going to come right I think you don't go every day well I don't know what's coming tomorrow no I don't know you just realize something's coming tomorrow how do we get the one we heard about it but thank God for healing but you see I'm going to tell you everything's all right amen and all of the things but now let's get on down to it but now listen see the I tried to get this point across to you that and I know you know this but there's people that are maybe don't know it and haven't seen it or heard it but see that Divine Healing campaign it was to get to people's attention right that God was alive right amen and living among us that's the way your Prophet described that right and in doing that see then it would bring he said we don't major on a minor and he said salvation is the most important thing right so it was getting the attention of the people to see salvation you know right all right amen that salvation is the real thing is the saving of the soul but then he says you can't preach salvation without preach healing right amen court is in the same atonement that's right okay so he said you don't want to be you'd be breaking up the Bible right the you'd be separating and say well one part's right now the parts not but see then in that healing though it would also meant a message would be coming because God doesn't send signs and wonders without sending a message that's right whether it would be salvation for the yes for the for the soul it would still be a message that would be coming forward all right and so would it be for the understanding the that you and I would have to come to the place to see the message that's right right not to to just just deal with healings and not to just do it but a message would come for it all right now I tried to preach it there Wednesday then about how the Lord Jesus you know right was dealing with the son of man and he had the sign of the son of man the resurrection right was there that's why he could stand there and say I am the resurrection now brother random couldn't stand and say I am the resurrection right but he could stand and say bring me 24 of your worst cases and I'll guarantee you healing problem because he was dealing with erection sign which is the prophet see prophetic right all right and dealing in that realm seat then he was welcomed in the early years the Lord Jesus was and brought around what in the early years and oh yeah that the little prophets you know yeah oh we're glad to have him but then as he began to bring his message right then they begin to say you know you can believe him in the healing because he couldn't deny that right that's right yeah but said now when he starts preaching well see that's how narrow-minded the human mind can be right but still because they couldn't match up with any of the signs in the the things that was taking place but they had to explain it to the people like we Baptists you know we said oh yeah we believe in healing we believe in healing but really we don't need healing anymore we go to the doctors well I never did believe it that way when I was there I didn't believe it that away I believe God is the Healer I'm not going to a doctor that tells me he doesn't believe in healing right right I told you what the one that I go to and one of me he said the doctors all said to him how can you believe in healing of the body when you all you know about medicine he said I want to ask you a question how can you believe in the and and see the the healing without knowing it's God right right because there's only one Healer right right there's only one there's only one can take can take care of but see a message I'm out right and brother Branham you see that a message would come forward can you hear that see because it's the signs and wonders was there yeah see they would have to be healing since thanks to father right you know sure but they would have to be a message man that's the point I'm trying to get you to see that there was a message back there yeah right we're going to try to break down something today the I'm like wrote around the early Ministry and in the later part of his ministry all right now see there was a message going forward now the prophet unless he said it in a church Egg book this message you're malachite of four to do two things one turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the father who revealed the seven Thunders which is revelation obtained in the Seven Seals it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn us back all right so he had to he had to do two things right when he started out he didn't preach to see it yes he preached them in 50 something sure jury breaks the seal to 50 something not long but right in there when he started he preached on the seals but yet he knew he wasn't right because he even preached the white horse rider as being me the Holy Ghost right yep but then when the later when it opened he seen what it was right so just get in mind now what I'm talking about that but uh that get to the point that a message always comes amen amen the healing is to get the people's attention right right see get people to come in and listening the message that's why I said that he started out in his early Ministry he would let people preach and then he'd come out and pray for the sick right well then he started preaching his own sermon well because they couldn't bring the message they wasn't ordained to bring the message so they couldn't do that but you gotta have the restoring of the faith of the fathers right back before you can talk about the prophet in his ministry of what he was to be so we had to to come and restore those things well see that's what he was doing back there in those years of the healing campaign he was preaching us back to the revelation of the faith of the father all right then that was the message are you following me now see the message that you're I'm talking about begin when the prophet began to try to preach us back to what the Bible said all right which would be called the faith of the fathers or what what they were you didn't they didn't take a novice name write the word right it was those who were seasoned in the word that wrote the Bible so then but there would be a healing campaign that's right all right now see then that healing campaign would never leave right amen all right but yet you see the prophet in the end of his ministry with a whole lot less signs and wonders taking place as it was in the early Ministry called the same thing with the Lord Jesus right that's what I tried to get to point across this message fits exactly the Lord Jesus and compares to where what he was doing see the Lord Jesus have a lot of healings and signs and wonders but after he went the amount of transfiguration very little to say it that's right sure there were people healed in different things but not like it was in his early Ministry now you know that's Bible read your Bible amen all right and see then read The Prophet's message and see and hear him declaring and see the healing to take place amen but then you see him begin to taper down see me he was coming to the third pool right amen the opening of the word amen she first pulled is what Divine Healing second pull prophecy third pool is wanting to opening to the word amen but what was prophecy sitting in order of scripture amen the Lord Jesus went out Healing The Sick and got their attention then he started to say I'm my father's one but Iran was getting the attention of the people then he started preaching the faith of the father amen right right but knowing that there would be a message come forth it would go into deeper debts amen but there was a message going forth while the healing was going forward that's what I want you to see all right all right amen while the healing was going forward a message was coming and I said that about it and Wade said well you maybe need to express a little more because I said there Wednesday you know that first pull was healing the prophet said second Paul's prophecy all right prophecy is setting in order of scripture Look up the word that's not prophesy prophecy right amen all right there's a difference in the two words prophecy prophesy look it up man all right so as the prophet was as healing was taking place in Jesus ministry he began to pray to preach the word right amen sitting in order the prophet came and he healing started taking place then he started setting in order to scriptures amen the word that we could talk about the faith of the father nobody talked about it nobody didn't know what the faith of the fathers they didn't even know anything about it they wasn't expecting it to take place right they were just rejoicing in a healing campaign and saying it's over with we're here you remember yeah see they said oh the rain brother and this is it he said how can you have a lot of rain when you ain't even had to form a rain right boy he tore up their little buddy a little little playgrounds didn't he yeah I want you to notice that in a minute you think of how hard and it is so hard to try to probably say this easy preaching life it's hard to preach true right but you think of it in this world I'm talking about down in our day right and stood there and began to try to speak about no Divine Healing no Resurrection that's right no glorified body what's the mankind didn't believe glorified body right you believe in getting a new one right I mean you believe in throwing this in the way smoking a little cigarettes it don't make no difference you don't throw this thing away and get you another one you know because that's what mankind was teaching right and you think of how hard it was now let me just say it in plain language all right had they not been the signs and wonders that was promised in the scripture the son of righteous wrestling is when had that not been the promise and had that not taken place how many people do you think would have believed wrote around him right no no come on think about it seriously when all of the great big guys you know from everybody up to the front down to the bottom oh we're gonna get us a new body we're gonna get us a new body and talking about Resurrection right yep educated people but don't you think it really hurt their feelings when brother Branham said now Resurrection doesn't mean replacement Dr so-and-so if I'd have been there to punch him I said why didn't you give us a definite why didn't you tell us that's what it meant you told us we're gonna get a new one yeah this little guy that don't know if ABC's is telling us we're gonna these whole bodies gonna be redeemed yeah amen right you think of how hard I wrote down emphasize this point you think of how hard it was right to preach it now I'm gonna go ahead with the rest of what I have in there that's why it's so hard today to try to talk about a Redemption of the body right absolutely see because there's not the great healing campaign right now the healing's still here don't misunderstand me right we still believe in it we still see it right here in many many statements all right but there's not a healing campaign why because see that was to speak of the message it would come right all right the message of the faith of the father is being restored right amen see now you got to take God's word you got to be like sister Hattie right when running around with speed she said that ain't nothing but the truth it's got to be something like that right amen see the healing is dropped down you don't see the healing like it used to be and right it's not because we're getting older I said this 40 years ago right I was preaching this 40 years ago that the world would have more signs and wonders if we did because they're only dealing with the healing right right we're not dealing with healing we're dealing with trying to preach the word right all right man and to believe the word and then let the healings follow it right amen amen I thought that's what we believe the third pool was was speaking the word yeah would you say and it's so hard to try to preach it when you think about a man standing against the whole world that's right but see I can't stand and do like he did because God didn't ordain me to do it but he say if you don't believe what I do you come up here and let's see you do it right yep well but they kept their seats didn't they all right he said you come up here and let's see you do it right if you know what the word's talking about for birthday more religious leaders are walking up and down you better make them one thing though when they got outside the door see you know oh he's just a smart alec he's no you know uneducated idiot and he just you know he doesn't know his ABCs he doesn't know that we know what we know about the Bible I wouldn't say that while he's in front of him all right yeah right right so is it today amen people are Yak behind you back but they won't come into your face because 40 years ago I was saying this this is not something I've come up with I preached it for 40 something years to try to show you it's got to be the opening of the word right amen people when I came into the mission boy blessed God one of these days wouldn't be able to speak the word I said you got to get it before you can speak it we got the book yeah that's what people think today they think they have the message and make light of other people um come on let's get down to this to the nitty-gritty as we call it the brother Maloney used to say get down where the the Rope the rubber meets the road let's get down to where we're leaving right you know and get to the point but look look what he says on number three of your notes we've read these before but let's read it again moderate events make clear by prophecy in 1965 1206. now remember this message started first with Divine Healing now that's your professional let's let him answer performing miracles and if God let that go through an ordinary church just like we already had then it wasn't God right okay now watch two minutes ago and watch the natural leadership 1965 1207. and any message that's come in a genuine born message of God is different from the old trend when a Divine Healing went forth not long ago did you notice how the impersonators followed it see and every one of them went right in them organizations staying there does anyone know that there had to be a message follow that why God don't entertain us he attracts our attention with something and when he attracts our attention then he's got the message and I gave you one nerve the other day where the Prophet said even if signs and wonder starts appearing and you stay in the same old message no I've told you 40 years ago that there'll come a time and you look out there now if you're blind open your eyes go and look out there you can see an organized religion there's healing campaigns and all kinds of things taking place and people being healed I don't know where that's Church you're still down in Florida that Baptist Church you've been going for I forgot how many years that they've been having service every day right hard for us to get here two or three times a week it's not English you you instead of us I say us because you just do the whole thing go down here you know that yeah but now listen if a healing campaign starts what are we gonna look at if a healing campaign was to start what are we going to look at it I warned you here 40 years ago that it would take place in the end time that one day all of these doctrines in the message that healings and things would start appearing and people are saying see there are my two Soul messages right look at the healing Mary my seventh under virtual message I heard my perusias my River Jordan tonight all that how many times have I said that to you should there come a time when signs and wonders will start appearing but the prophet said if it's the same old message right don't do it right don't follow it I worked a man coming to lay down ten dead people in there and the cat gets ready then done been bombed and he says to prove that my two Soul doctrines right or my my Baptist Doctrine or anything that you want to bring me you know put a name to it all he's going to be raised in the dead and they're all raised now what are you going to do it the Bible says see we quote one but it won't like the other one one says if a prophet comes and speaks and it comes to pass you better hear the prophet that's one scripture but there's another scripture in there it said if a prophet comes and brings you a sign and it come to pass and he take you to another God don't believe him cause I sent it among you to try you remember about a month or two or your while back I was preaching on that what you see we want something to look at to crash hold on to it instead of just taking God's word that's the only way I've ever got my healing or anything is just taking God's word and just say buy Stripes I'm Healed and then just have to wait until it comes to pass I've seen healings and miracles and wonders yes but I've seen that we have to stand on God's word because he's trying us to see what we'll do but you see that's passing the people and so then they start running for something else yeah that's right and then they claimed it out trying to prop it up I'm not trying to prop up nothing I'm telling it like it is that's what people don't like when you tell it like it is but you see the message that would follow the healing all right now get the two points you want to talk about there was a message followed the healing campaign that started in the 30s right okay a message followed taking and going back in the prophet preaching stature perfect man and all those messages greatest battle ever fought all those things trying to restore the face of the father right right right all right telling the Pentecostal people right here is where you fail did you thought we got it all but he said I come to tell you you can't have a letter right until you get a former running right amen and they didn't even have a former reign of the faith of the fathers let alone the prophet's message that's right let me get to this point do you say what brought it down everybody believes in a resurrection how do you believe it right sure mankind has always believed in the resurrection but like I said a while ago you never looked up the word Resurrection we didn't do that when you want to look oh one of these days yep but Resurrection don't mean percent put one thing down drop a book pick up another book doesn't mean that probably said this same body that goes down got a raise that's Resurrection amen but how many people wanted to believe it with a man with a seventh grade education like I said they couldn't argue the signs and the Wonders but when they got over in her little compartments talking later you know he just don't understand somebody ought to said don't understand you remember the man that was blind I might unless if I get my right one and was healed even his mom and daddy got scared because they wanted to know who healed him Mama and Daddy got scared because they knew they'd be thrown out of the church right and Mom and Daddy said ask him he's of age you remember that in the Bible yeah ask him about it we ain't taking no changes hey you know there's something that's why I'll tell you I don't care if it's a song you hear that the Beatles play and your heel God does the healing amen amen amen that's what you see if you remember one day now to get the point of what we're talking about Resurrection you remember one day there in the scripture Lazarus died right yes right right yep you remember the Lord Jesus just kept going when they said he worded he's sick so finally the disciples couldn't understand it real good right Jesus said uh Lazarus you know he sleep but he's gonna go waking he's what do you mean he said Lazarus is dead he finally just had to speak plain language to him right Lazarus is dead right so they got over there and here comes Mata Lord Jesus if you hadn't been here right read your scripture if you hadn't been here Lazarus wouldn't have died yep Bishop where did you bury him foreign oh yes Lord Jesus Christ we believe it's John it's in the Gospel of John oh yeah we believe in a resurrection one day everybody's going to raise because they knew the scripture said that they were Pharisees not Sadducees right but see the surprise was when Jesus said I am the resume amen amen well we don't understand your message come on trying to illustrate right right we don't understand your message he said if you can't believe the message I bring he said show me the grave come on he said if you don't believe the message I bring how about the signs and the Wonders and see Martha didn't believe that who he was but he said take me to the Grave he proved he was the resurrection right that's right but you see we all believe in a resurrection but do we believe it like Martha yes one of these days do we believe it like Joe one of these days let's see something happened to job one day and God said stand up on your feet and get out of your own understanding right and he come forth he said I know my redeemer liveth in the last days he'll be up on the earth and I'll see him for myself and not for another amen peace all the resurrection when are we going to see the resurrection amen right do you understand what I'm getting at yes a message a message Jesus told Martha the message all right let's get let's read hypocrite what is it John what I got to wrote down in here somebody find it I don't know it's well where my nose is John what Young Living all right let's just read that let's see what Jesus said he said a lot more than what we think what scripture is it but I can't even find anything all right all right let's back that right about yeah let's go back up to 20. let's go back and just prove the point let's go back to verse 22 21. they said Martha unto Jesus Lord if not it has been here my brother had not died but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it thee see she still look for one up younger and one down here Jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again listen verse 24 Moses saith unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life right now once this is it have you ever listened to the rest of what he said oh me I am the resurrection in the life he that believeth in me amen though he were dead yet shall he live amen he not only spoke to her of a resurrection of Lazarus his message was to tell her that one day we will stand in a glorified body right and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die amen oh now what that means Brother David that means that we we don't die we go to the grave and we come out amen but that wasn't what Jesus was saying that's right he's saying I am the resurrection amen in one day somebody will catch it come on brother and when they catch it they won't die you say how do you know cause Paul said that's right in the same spirit that Jesus spoke it in will be changed a moment to drink of an eye the last Trump for the trumpet shall sign amen listen Jesus did he that believeth in me shall never die believe it's not this because then he went and raised to death he preached his message and then he raised the Dead the prophet preached the message back there in the beginning in the 30s and on the end of the 40s and coming on in that we only have from 49 I think or 47 47 we only have 47 up at least you know counting the message the prophet recorded called recording systems and things that they've done but yet he would go out and start preaching dealing would take place to prove that what he was preaching was right yep how many times you ever heard him say if what I've told you is the truth let God come behind me now that's right and prove it and you know what God came by behind him and proved it yes except for people don't understand right you know that even when he was preaching the white horse rider wrong and preaching it as the Holy Spirit check the message that he said that in and see if healings and signs didn't take place all right you see yeah but brother Dale he's preaching wrong there was nobody in this world could tell him what was right right and God went to his ignorance until the day come is that scripture right yeah when the day came that God revealed it to him God didn't win no more that's right God winked at them because there was nobody who could tell that Prophet like I told you if you don't believe it go back and just think about it sensibly remember where you came from you came from churches 90 percent of what's here came from organized religion churches and you know every one of them thought we're going to get a new body right like I said even if they did teach anything about it of a change it was like we was we read it and then turned around and said we're going to get a new one we read Paul the chain in the morning and still say we're gonna get a new one it's all no we didn't well I tell you something we believe because not to believe in the resurrection right yep right right is that saying about the blind man while ago what did he say when they brought him in after his mom and dad he wouldn't even agree would help him they brought him in to talk to him read your Bible give God the glory they said he said well now let me ask you one question I'm paraphrasing this but he said let me ask you one question he said now I was blind and everybody knows I was blind but now I can see and he said show me where you ever done it right right he said it and really if you're reading the scripture he said show me in the Bible where anybody would ever blind and saw reach a scripture right right now he wasn't meaning there wasn't people back in the Old Testament didn't get healed he's just making his point strong did you not show me where you'd knew it right I said I was blind and this man gave me my side of you oh let's see you do it all right how many show brother Dale where he's ever went off the message but you better bring your clothes with you when you're coming but what I mean by that is you were going to have a little time talking and then we're going to talk about all of the things you followed see that's why people won't come and talk to me because my memory is still good at 71 and I can remember all the doctrines that people have been into and where I had to dig some of them out of it yeah but it's like I dug a whole church out of a polygamy one time you know what a year or so later I called up there to talk to the man he didn't even know who I was brother who you think it won't turn against you and I dug a whole church out of where they were already planning on who was going home who 'd you see people don't pay no attention to those things people don't like it that's why they won't come well if they won't come then there's one thing for about it they must be obscure to come when I'm like this like I've always said when it comes to a day and these doctrines and ideas comes up and a man comes up and said prove it if I don't get up and walk up there if you don't get me by the seat in the bridges and nap in the neck and cure me up there there's something wrong with you that's right because I'll do you that way all right you tell me what you believe you better be ready to stand on it all right amen somebody challenges you better be ready to stand on what you well I didn't want to hurt no feeling Don't Wanna Hurt no feelings that's right used to say Hogwarts that's right but I got a big red thing you think of how much that profit how that he tried his best to preach of the resurrection and God came behind him and proved the resurrection was Dire and yet how many believe it right come on how many believed you sad quotes I seen God but we won't talk about his Doctrine you know we won't talk about that another way about a lady that was a tight on them new brother smoking them newer and I'll try to think of her name one of these days and she prayed for the sick they asked her about brother Brown she said well I guess I never seen no greater except in my own Ministry that's how we could be yeah all right let's get on down with it see folks then the prophet had to preach and the healings was taking place to match it first pull up second pull was exactly in line right her first pull was healing was prophecy sitting in order of scriptures Look up the word when you get home right getting in order of scriptures he was sitting in order the faith of the fathers telling us the Bible means what it says that's right he didn't change the Bible it was our thoughts and it changed it come on the Bible never taught a trinity it never caught Eternal Hells or stuff like that but yet we thought it did yeah see the prophet had to come and straighten all that out before he could get into any part of his own right I was watching it see where we're talking about on the study of the adoption in three stages we've come to the bases of talking about here ye him where the Lord Jesus on the Mount of transfiguration and we see that from the minor Transfiguration he began to as I said the other day bring the seals and the things right on his way to Calvary he began to bring a deeper message than the message he had been bringing amen are you listening in his early Ministry they could follow him a little bit but when he began to say I'm my father's one they didn't like that right how much was it when he got into the seals and preached Matthew 24. when he preached six seals they didn't even know what in the world it was about it right I asked you to show me commentators and even you sure in the Baptist Church we talked about the six seals of tribulation we talked about that in the Baptist Church I remember that what do you think we understood the first one or anything else no no no we didn't know but still just get the point but see it come to a place when that Prophet had finished bringing the message he said it took him 30 something years to reach statue a perfect man now here's one said that go to the books that's your perfect man look he's 30 something years to be able to bring that message okay and how many people even still believed him as I said right I come to people of this message there's a big portion of them still believe we're going to get us another body I don't believe in this body being redeemed if we're going to get us a new body right and like I said there Wednesday someone will say new and you don't know what their meaning if you question oh yeah yeah I just didn't explain that no you left it to where people could believe what they want to about what you said all right right those preachers don't like that that's why I like to say it where there's no problem you don't have to worry about what brother Dale believes right right ask a lady one time what did their Pastor preach she'd come from there and come here and been there for years and years I said what do you preach on the show she said I ain't never heard him never heard any preach about it that's Atlanta okay but now watch in that early Ministry a message went forth that's why people don't understand this when we get down in a minute and we start reading it we have time without we pick a decision when they start talking about the prophet said his message begun in the seals right yep well what do you mean we're going to see I appreciate it for you yeah he had to destroy the faith of the fathers yeah because that was down and gone Hallelujah that's what he was doing right amen and that's what God was vindicating right amen that he was right amen he was bringing the message and the healings and the signs and the Wonders first book second four was laying right together don't just abruptly take one make it this and make this there's no hearing this is what I want to call the first Bulldog into the word second pull to open the word third pool's opening that's the best way I can say it after 40 years right and you come show me that's wrong because that's what he was doing you show me under the first pool you know what I'm fixing to show you most study run around and reach out and take a person by the hand he said see you I take my watch off and she called it'll it'll just destroy he'd take him by the hand he said look at here he said see all them bumps on my hand he said you got cancer that was a gift right right cause impersonators to come out you know failed at seen it this that the other he couldn't help that but he's doing what was right but what was so amazing you don't even listen to what he was saying and he said see there he said you got cancer my hand shows that he says only left long now what showed him that the opening of the word right if I can read it right he said you got cancer when you left lung you got cancer here you got cancer in there what showed him that the hand vibration was one thing the boxer on the hand was a gift that just showed you had certain diseases you see the opening of the word was taking place in the early Ministry of the Prophet that's my people couldn't follow me he walked out there and going on up into the last part of 62 and over towards 63. you've just just dying down looked like wouldn't it yep right friction the greatest makes the world had ever heard outside of the days of the Apostles and God proven it was signs and wonders right the message would follow and it did right now let's get on down to where we're at see the Divine Healing was to get the attention of the people so that they would believe that God is alive brother Brown said and living among us see because that's what healing shows God being alive all right now let's get a few of these because we'll try to catch something see then the message declared the healing and things to be right into healing declared the message to be right you agree right amen the prophet preach the message God come behind him and healed we went together same things the Lord Jesus he would go out there and preach the message that anybody over sick and to show you you say well what about right around Circle well what about the Lord Jesus when he had the legal cities there because he said he could not heal nobody in that City that's right because of their unbelief almighty God in flesh could not heal read your Bible because of their unbelief what about over to the wood of the little girl when he put everybody out in the room except Peter James and John to get out of here there's too much unbelief in here I can't do it and when they got out he raised the Dead all right read your Bible that's right because God can't go over your free more agency right that's right he has to allow that to where you can do it but now listen but then the prophet knew also that while he was preaching that message yep I believe he come to a realization that that wasn't the message he come to bring right that's why he would say I've laid a foundation Maybe for somebody else he said if that be true then I'd be going off the scene you remember those statements see he knew as he was coming up in there was a message to come cause revisions and the dreams and the things started taking place all right and he began to see that he had to go to Arizona and connect with angels and come back and things like that now look what he began to say does everybody understand what I'm saying now I want to make sure that's right where you can understand it was a healing campaign went out that was a message went with it but it was the message of the faith of the father and when that become to a position then the prophet could begin to start looking for his own message right because he knew he was bringing back like they did he said when he went beyond the curtain of time what did he say they told him to make me do that he said well Peter and then be judged said yes he said then I'll be there because I preached exactly like Peter Neal go on the Statue of a perfect man where he said them disciples they were men a few words and they got in the Pulpit he said then when it come down to the point like this he said it it would come to her that those disciples had the least little nods from God you keep reading about maybe a dozen paragraphs or less and he'll see there I was waiting about praying for that little child and he said I was waiting he said and I got a little nod from God all right you should have not went forth and it was delivered amen sure and we're standing do you believe in the third poll asked to speak the word right so then if they're going to be a third foolish to speak in the word and signs and wonders father there's got to be a message are you listening so look at number five on your note let's just read with you two I'll read real fast because I've been doing this for 40 years to you but not to people out there that are listening to some new ones that are coming in but look at what he said on the leadership he said it was to get there what he gets message to attract the attention all right look at souls in prison 1963 11 10. it's run out now this is 63. I asked during the opening of the season right okay it's done it's finished and then the scripture says at the message of the seventh Earthly Angel the messenger on Earth the seventh and last Church age at the beginning of its Ministry when he starts off into the Earth at that time the mystery of God of these seals should be made known by that time now we see where we're at could it be friends could it be notice all possible he said well I said he said that's when he started now see how the human mind just in case you're clicked that away that's what I like to do I like to pick up your mind and express it you said what he just said when he first begins his ministry okay let's read some more now trying to do go out of service 1965 718. you read all this in there and don't worry about it it'll be there I just underlined something for you we'd say reading the whole thing have it in the sounding of the last Angel Revelation 10 in the days of the seventh angel of these Mysteries that's all been why did the methodists do this in the Baptist and the Church of Christ and the Jehovah Witness all do that the Mysteries will be revealed in the last days when the seven angels seventh Angels message when he not when he starts out doing this but when he begins to sound his message see not the years in preparation but that when he begins to sound the message these Mysteries will be revealed and here they are not knowing them and your people are the witness of that so now he certainly lay that down as it will be later not just the beginning of his life works his faith expressed 65 11-26 and that brings to past because we have faith and I know this is of God is because this and other scriptures point to this hour Revelation 10 said in the hour of the seventh Angels message when he begins to sound forth his message not in a healing service but the message that follows the healing service Now where's your place in that still works as Fresh Express that was paragraph 293 this is paragraph 303. he knowed the word that would finally catch up with them he knows there come a time when the word would manifest itself and they couldn't go no further see that's where you your impersonators are left out because they can't go with the word right so have I know this all these years see that's right that the time would come when any miracle that God sins a real miracle there's always a change in the whole system if God sends something into the church and the old system's not changed he sent it in vain when a message Goes Forth in signs and wonders there is a message follows that when Jesus went forth healing then come his message what would I my father won right paragraph 151 Rapture message 65 1204. when I went forth into meetings with you praying for the sick it was fine but when I come with a message if any message goes forward if it's a true message if it's a true message genuine miracles of god and hangs right into that organization you know it's not of God because that thing's already declared right look at that already declared yep if it did happen the Baptist had their day of healing right right but that's done been declared see this is a different time right that Jesus went forth and healed the sick in order to catch the eyes of the people then his message that's right it has to have something that God's going to introduce he's just Divine Healing his miracles like that just catch the eyes of the people the main heart of it is the message there's what it's what what comes from in here he's trying to get into favor of the people so that they'll list sit and listen to him see and there's some more in there that's ordained to life trying to do God of service without his will 1965 1127 the beat part he's talking about Janice and jambers which stood Moses so will these in the last day see the same thing come right along impersonating it just exactly see be careful watch the doctrine of the Bible watch the message that follows them signs till the same old school of message forget it God sent Miracles and signs to attract the attention of the people when Jesus come just Healing The Sick and so forth showed it to profits and they thought Oh Glory he's coming wrapped your message paragraph 156 65 120 forward in my message all the time knowing back there under healing and so forth like that just to catch the people's attention knowing the message would come and here it is now did I make that statement want to go all right you knew and them Seven Seals opened those Mysteries and showed those things is what happened I didn't know it but there's men standing right here and it was there and you heard the message first what time it I have heard but now I see 1965 11 27 evening service then he promised in the hour of the seventh Angels message the Seven Seals would be revealed and the mysteries of God would be declared Revelation 10 when the seventh angel begins to sound his message not the healing service the message that follows the healing service Rapture paragraph 107 65 1204. and here also at top of the seven Church Ages which in Revelation 10 7 that great mystery the book was to be unfolded by the seventh Angels message now there's a message about messenger above all these and a messenger on the earth the English word means eating is word angel means messenger and in the seventh Angels message while he was making he is proclaiming his ministry then he began to sound forth his ministry not when he started out and then Jesus started out with the healings and the thing what's this to happen number 14 of your notes the breach 1963 307 The Mystery of the book of book it is in them seals from Genesis to Revelation a complete Plan of Redemption is revealed in those Seven Seals all right what just showing you the point get back and explain for a second page 104. that was the bricks that I was just reading from which was page 92 this is page 104 104. 1963 317 and the whole creation lays in his hands on which the whole Plan of Redemption is sealed by seven mysterious seals in this book that he took now watch he alone can reveal it oh there's a book of redemption all those last two of the evening but listen you still want to burn it down ain't no quote no word the prophet said my message be a gun in 63. no but we just read enough that's right that's right to show you he said where his message is right through the opening of the seal that's right because no man had preached those things right we'll get to it this afternoon too the nobody preached Redemption of the body that's right even if they did it was like Mazda with a resurrection all right that someday it'll come the prophet prophet of God brought the message of redemption for Body Spirit soul and world right now show me any commentator Schofield has some points on it but show me any of them that preached any word that this world was going to be redeemed right nope don't be destroyed don't blow it all to me it's all right that's what you've been taught I read something one day or heard the prophet say it and it really has stuck with me he said remember that's what they've been taught stuff like that that's what you've been told exactly right you and I have been taught all of our life certain things exactly like it's hard to change isn't it hard to lay down showing her thank you right that's what gets me about the people and some of you even here say well boy when I first saw it man I sit right there and I'm back thinking it took me about eight months or six months or maybe 12 months to get you baptized amen that's why I said I'm sorry I'm I am I'm sorry that I can remember I wish I could forget you see I come through that too all right all right all right I studied this message from 66 until 67 before I left the Baptist Church he was in 67 right now I got baptized it took me a year just to get baptized and God sent you heard me tell it God sent an old Baptist preacher by one day or was having a Revival or something I had a distant preacher and he preached all you do in word indeed I do all in the name of Jesus Christ and the whole church started if you ever been in the Baptist you'd know come on you did you ever been in the Baptist or church or anywhere you say for God's sake my daddy-law used to call him the good Master you know they had names like that for the Lord's sake or what didn't they pray but all at once that whole church started praying in the name of Jesus Christ I said turn to look at that old preacher and I thought God thank you for sending that God bye the next day I told Brother mode I said when we're going to the water I settled it see all you do in word indeed right see then it was something that to wet I came to an understanding but there was no other way you said well what kept you so long one thing Pride more dying deacon at 23 years old teaching when I left I was teaching the adult Sunday school class which was the deacons and elders and their wives and teaching the training Union I was training Union director and Sunday school superintendent and all these different things at the same time had about five or six jobs I had to resign from good Pride rather than hell Pride I ain't never had no Pride that's where you're proud right now right you missed it see I knew the day I was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that I was out of the Baptist Church because most of you don't know it because you've never been there you can go to from a Baptist to a Methodist or Baptist to a Catholic you can go do anything you want to and you don't have to get baptized but if you go from any church to a Baptist Church you're going to be baptized in that Baptist Church that's right that is the Baptist Doctrine and I knew that I knew the day I baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I was going to have to tell them and leave you go right now International you're going to be I don't care if you've been baptized 20 times and if you've been baptized you're going to be baptized in that church and the father son and I'll go if you don't believe that go find your Baptist preacher and ask if I come down and join your church today it won't be the first thing I have to do is to get baptized I've been baptized yeah but you're going to be baptized in the Baptist see I knew the day I was baptized that's the last day I could go that I'd end in my career at that time I've been 27. I had to leave did you see we think we understand and do it must name that's right do we understand all said to wit to understand it goes on later in the Corinthians and the other scriptures and explains a lot about the change of the body but he should be adoption that we need to understand is to wit the Redemption of the body then in the last days here come the prophet what was he doing preaching Redemption of the body right he preached it so long until I get to it this evening preached so long and he wound up preaching that the world would have to be redeemed now probably when he first started out preaching about Resurrection no Divine Healing no Resurrection he probably didn't see that the world would be redeemed but you read the future home that's why I've asked you to go over that message he said I've taught it from the beginning he said now we see the world has to go through the same stages of redemption I ain't gonna ask you to raise your hand but how many of you have read right the future home since I asked you to give you now about three weeks have you heard the tape or listened to it please do it by Wednesday I'm just asking you I'm just assigning I'm the teacher okay I'm assigning your homework I don't have time you've got time for everything else right that's right yep let's see wait 369 inspired anybody have a knee 369. so I'm glad morning foreign service on his telephone you think about a modern invention he said there's a guy every day I don't know where he's in the car with him or what was doing he had the radio on and he had to off on up his ear listening to the message the guy was nice enough to even turn the radio down to be something odd we are odd all right we just love the word all right with my life I can't handle my way Oh Glory out of my way come on my way I agree I'm by the way
