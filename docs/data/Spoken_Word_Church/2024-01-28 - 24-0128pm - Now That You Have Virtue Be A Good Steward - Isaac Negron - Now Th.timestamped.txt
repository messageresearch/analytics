[39:31] chapter it says in the 17th verse it
[39:34] says and he came down with them and
[39:37] stood in the plain now in in I was
[39:41] reading it in a different I don't know
[39:42] if it was the NIV or something else but
[39:44] it said that he came down and stood on a
[39:46] level ground so he came and stood on
[39:49] level ground and the company and the
[39:53] company of his disciples and a great
[39:55] multitude of people out of Judea and
[39:58] Jerusalem and from the Sea Coast and of
[40:00] Tyree and cyan which came to hear him
[40:04] and to be healed of all of their
[40:07] diseases and they that were vexed with
[40:10] unclean spirits and they were
[40:13] healed the whole multitude sought to
[40:16] touch him for there went virtue out of
[40:20] him and healed them all so you may have
[40:24] your seats so so now that all the
[40:27] bitterness is gone
[40:30] right now that all the bitterness is
[40:32] gone uh let me go here today's topic I
[40:35] didn't give you guys the last one but
[40:36] today's uh now that you have virtue
[40:38] right now we're going through the statue
[40:40] ourselves and we're on virtue right now
[40:42] but um it says here and I don't have
[40:45] that much notes this time wait uh
[40:47] somebody was telling me keep it to 15
[40:48] minutes so we get out of here so I've
[40:51] been already warned and if I don't do
[40:53] that I get fed to the pit bools next
[40:54] door I heard the dogs barking next door
[40:57] you know who said that right T brother
[41:00] Terrence yeah brother Terence I'm going
[41:01] feed you them pit bulls
[41:03] boy they call me boy down here I don't
[41:05] know what that means
[41:10] but anyway so um so yeah I just found
[41:14] that interesting that he came and stood
[41:15] on level ground so you know level ground
[41:19] Faith the new birth right you got a good
[41:21] foundation he came and stood on level
[41:23] ground and once he was on level ground
[41:25] he was able to accomplish something and
[41:27] you know for us that's what the Lord's
[41:29] trying to bring us to up through the
[41:30] statue of a perfect man because there's
[41:32] something he wants to accomplish through
[41:33] us you know we know that Jesus said he
[41:35] was the first fruits right well guess
[41:38] what you can get to become first fruits
[41:42] too so you know that's what we're
[41:44] working towards now we're trying to get
[41:46] all the bitterness and Malice and
[41:48] everything that's that troubles us out
[41:49] of our lives and that way we can have
[41:51] love one for another we can move forward
[41:53] and help those around us you know like I
[41:56] said I believe that the statute of a
[41:57] perfect man is not so much for you even
[42:00] though it's your challenge but it's for
[42:02] others you know what I mean and there's
[42:04] a work to be done and it's a short work
[42:06] because you see the day we're living in
[42:09] you know not to mention brother way done
[42:11] preached 1977 so that puts us at 20 2026
[42:15] and that's right around the
[42:17] corner so something's going to happen
[42:19] Trump's going to mess it all up right
[42:21] even though we all want Trump in he's
[42:24] just a fun kind of guy I guess I know he
[42:26] just says funny things Little Rocket
[42:29] Man I thought that was funny ain't it a
[42:33] brother Aaron Little Rocket
[42:36] Man but uh so yeah Jesus came and stood
[42:38] on level ground and and you see that he
[42:40] started he went to work there so it says
[42:42] the M ma major benefits I was going to
[42:45] preach a different sermon um oh it's not
[42:47] oh there it is let me go I was going to
[42:49] preach a different sermon on uh uh salt
[42:54] uh the salt of the earth but I didn't I
[42:57] didn't get to it but I do touch it here
[42:58] a little bit but I just find it
[43:00] interesting that there are a lot of
[43:02] people that are dehydrated think about
[43:05] that you understand what I'm saying
[43:07] right now
[43:08] dehydrated and so so you can't hold
[43:11] water when you dehydrated it's hard to
[43:13] hold water you must have some salt you
[43:17] know what I'm saying and so there's
[43:18] going to be people around you right
[43:21] that's going to draw virtue I Noti one
[43:22] of the first things when when um when
[43:25] when I came to the new birth I started
[43:26] noticing there was people around me that
[43:28] were trying to draw something you got to
[43:30] get it for yourself obviously but when
[43:32] when you come to the New Birth there's
[43:34] just a glow about you right it's it's
[43:36] newness it's like meeting your
[43:37] girlfriend for the first time and
[43:40] everything's glowing and
[43:42] everything you ain't sleeping on the
[43:44] couch yet and all that but uh you know
[43:46] it's a situation to
[43:47] [Laughter]
[43:49] where you can't do nothing wrong boy but
[43:52] uh I remember one time uh uh man here I
[43:55] go off my my notes but I remember one
[43:57] time I we we had just started dating and
[44:00] my wife received this huge bouquet at
[44:02] the house and um I'm not romantic my dad
[44:05] didn't teach me to be romantic that's
[44:07] yeah we messed up there but
[44:10] um but uh so she got this huge bouquet
[44:13] of flowers and I walked over I came over
[44:15] to the house and um she was like oh
[44:18] thank you and I'm like I ain't give you
[44:20] those where you get those from it was
[44:22] her last boyfriend right huh your last
[44:28] so I'm like man my goodness I said well
[44:31] we get to share them
[44:32] together I started smelling
[44:36] them
[44:38] what yeah I'm going get back to my nose
[44:41] here but yeah so well you know the salt
[44:45] of the earth but huh yeah I got one I
[44:49] yeah I put one in yep and um I told
[44:51] Brother way to remind me to put a prayer
[44:53] cloth in here but uh cuz you get you you
[44:56] know sometimes you forget and you're all
[44:57] over the place but but anyway so you
[44:59] know it's a situation to where you know
[45:01] you got to now that you've the Lord's
[45:04] brought you to a place where you got all
[45:06] these things out of your life he can use
[45:08] you you can be a vessel you know what I
[45:11] mean and and there's a lot of work right
[45:14] there's a lot of work a family members
[45:16] Frank Franklin just came up here and
[45:17] spoke I I remember talking to him
[45:19] through the years and his sister his
[45:21] sister living the perfect Christian Life
[45:23] right you come over you see her she's
[45:26] just been you know but it just it just
[45:28] wasn't there you know and just be salty
[45:31] never give up never give up don't give
[45:34] up never too late never too late so you
[45:37] know if there's someone that you're
[45:39] praying for or or someone's on your
[45:41] heart or or or things of that nature
[45:43] just don't just keep keep in there keep
[45:46] in there I'm thinking about Rahab right
[45:48] now it's not in my notse but you know
[45:50] Rahab was able to convince her family to
[45:54] come into a home where she did her
[45:57] thing understand that think about that
[45:59] her father come into her home where she
[46:02] did her place of business and she was
[46:04] able to convince them right now the
[46:07] Bible says that she redeemed her
[46:11] father the Bible says that she brought
[46:13] honor to her father so you know it's a
[46:16] situation where you know it doesn't
[46:18] matter what what it may look like the
[46:20] circumstances you know uh the time will
[46:22] come God's appointed time and and that's
[46:24] what happened with Franklin but um here
[46:26] it says here uh unity in the body
[46:29] therefore I a prisoner in the Lord
[46:31] exhort you to walk worthy of the calling
[46:33] that which were you you were called with
[46:36] all humility and gentleness with
[46:40] patience bearing with one another in
[46:42] love being diligent to keep the unity of
[46:45] the spirit in the bond of Peace one body
[46:48] one Spirit just as you were called into
[46:51] one hope of your calling one Lord One
[46:53] Faith one baptism one one God and Father
[46:57] of all who is over all and through all
[47:02] and in all ain't that beautiful and I
[47:05] know that's been said many of times but
[47:06] just you know it's you that doesn't
[47:08] never get old because it doesn't matter
[47:10] what what the conditions is what it
[47:12] looks like now God is still God and he's
[47:14] in all through all above all he's
[47:17] everywhere so he's in charg am and uh we
[47:20] just keep pressing forward and and you
[47:22] know like myself I got a picture of my
[47:24] family that sits above the fireplace
[47:26] there at my house and every morning me
[47:28] and my wife will drink coffee before I
[47:29] go to work and I'm constantly praying
[47:31] for each one the family is growing and
[47:34] each one's coming in and and it's just
[47:36] like you know what my dad you know my
[47:38] dad claimed his ground right we were my
[47:41] dad's ground right we come from my dad
[47:44] and so now I'm claiming my ground and
[47:46] you claim your ground right CLA claim
[47:49] your cold workers claim the ones that
[47:51] give you water you know the ones that
[47:53] are good to you your boss that's good to
[47:54] you you know because it's it's it's
[47:56] getting late it's late we're Burning
[47:58] Midnight Oil right now I had preached a
[48:00] sermon one time about the uh uh trimming
[48:03] your lamps and um it's beautiful when
[48:05] you look at the uh the oil the oil lamp
[48:08] you know you see that oil lamp like this
[48:10] and then it's got the uh oil at the
[48:12] bottom of it then it's got the the wick
[48:14] in it and then it's got the uh the flame
[48:16] you know and and when you look at that
[48:19] it's
[48:20] like that oil defies
[48:24] gravity think about that
[48:26] that oil has to divide gravity you know
[48:29] it's drawn upward right we got to divide
[48:31] gravity
[48:32] folks you you understand what I'm saying
[48:35] we got to get that flame lit right we
[48:37] got to get that flame lit so you know
[48:40] when when you look at that oil lamp I
[48:41] seen that's what I seen right there may
[48:44] identify gravity you know and I was
[48:46] telling brother Wade I said you know a
[48:48] lot of times when I was younger I always
[48:50] thought about taking the body change I
[48:52] said man that's going to be hard you got
[48:54] to defy gravity yeah you know that's
[48:56] like the hard part but that's actually
[48:58] the easy part folks think about it this
[49:01] the hard
[49:03] part this right here is the hard part
[49:05] where your cowork somebody cut you off
[49:07] right right so you know it's a situation
[49:09] to where you know the easy part is when
[49:11] and I was telling brother Wade think how
[49:13] easy it's going to be when your loved
[49:14] ones start coming walking in here
[49:16] brother brother Ray and all these
[49:18] brothers that come walking in I don't
[49:19] know all of them my dad knows and that's
[49:20] his job but all the other brothers they
[49:22] come walking in right now now wait a
[49:25] minute you was in the grave yeah and you
[49:27] in here now so any doubt you had about
[49:30] taking a body change about 30
[49:32] days you going to be out of here that's
[49:37] right so don't don't don't focus on the
[49:40] body change so much Focus here and you
[49:43] had you've had aund and how many sermons
[49:46] 120 something sermons they ain't got no
[49:48] excuse here so you know and I hey I
[49:52] ain't got no excuse either cuz I'm tired
[49:53] with y'all so all right all right so it
[49:56] says here um I want to show y'all
[49:58] something real quick I was I I did a a
[50:01] little study on the butterfli I preached
[50:03] a message on a butterfly there at church
[50:05] and uh how many y'all like butterflies
[50:08] go ahead Lise you can raise your hand
[50:11] all right okay you ain't that tough all
[50:13] right all right I like butterflies
[50:16] too but you know it's a situation to
[50:19] where you know you got butter a
[50:21] butterfly here so the butterfly just
[50:22] that that first butterfly right there
[50:24] that's that's God
[50:26] okay that's God and so when you're born
[50:30] when you're born you're that egg you're
[50:33] that you came from God right now you got
[50:36] some end stars that happen here and
[50:38] during these end
[50:40] Stars okay during these in stars all
[50:43] that caterpillar does is eat Munch Munch
[50:47] Munch Munch Munch Munch M that's all it
[50:48] does eat think about that that's right
[50:52] right we got to eat folks keep eating
[50:55] right
[50:56] and you keep growing you keep keep
[50:57] shedding it keeps shedding it keeps
[50:59] growing growing growing and then finally
[51:01] it gets to a place where it goes into
[51:03] the Crysis here you see the Crysis now I
[51:06] was telling brother way I don't know
[51:07] about you cuz I always wonder they
[51:08] always said brother brandom came to
[51:10] adoption right you've heard that term
[51:12] it's come to adoption it confused me at
[51:14] first because I'm like well adoption
[51:16] that's the body change well there's
[51:19] layers of it we know that right well if
[51:21] you if you look at that crysalis you see
[51:24] the clear crysalis
[51:27] you see the wings in there that's where
[51:29] brother Brandon wound up right there you
[51:32] see that but when the dead in Christ
[51:34] rise he going to Flap he going to
[51:36] fly you see what I'm saying so so now I
[51:40] understood it I understood it while I
[51:41] was studying oh that's what happened to
[51:43] brother brandom he he got his wings he
[51:46] came to
[51:47] adoption but there'll come a time he'll
[51:50] fly and when he flies I hope he he nice
[51:53] be nice he come over here right and
[51:54] visit y'all a little bit then come up
[51:57] our way I said up our
[52:01] way Christian I done messed up a couple
[52:04] times he's probably over there laughing
[52:05] he's got me a couple times but that's
[52:07] okay but you know you come to a place
[52:09] where you you you're coming up the
[52:10] statue of a perfect man and like I've
[52:12] always like I believe it's not so much
[52:14] for you even though you have to achieve
[52:17] it it's for others right so so so guess
[52:22] what you're a
[52:24] steward you know know what a steward is
[52:26] somebody that manages something that
[52:28] don't belong to
[52:30] them right so you know um I I I think of
[52:34] it this way uh uh when I was a deacon in
[52:37] the other Church there uh one night all
[52:39] the ministers were gone so they were
[52:40] like hey come here I'm like yeah we need
[52:43] y'all to speak to the youth I'm like
[52:45] what that was my first time ever
[52:47] speaking so I was like nervous so I went
[52:48] home started studying I came up with
[52:51] stewardship but you know it's a
[52:52] situation where I was able to talk to
[52:54] the youth there
[52:55] and um I told him it's you know David
[52:57] was given
[52:58] sheep but it wasn't his sheep it was his
[53:01] father's sheep so he was a steward of
[53:04] his father sheep and because he did
[53:07] right the lord gave him a nation but it
[53:10] still wasn't his Nation it was God's
[53:13] people you know so you know no matter
[53:15] how you cut it you slice it you know
[53:17] your children don't belong to you you
[53:19] know my wife don't belong to me you know
[53:21] you understand what I'm saying my my own
[53:23] my own body my own self I don't belong
[53:25] you understand so I'm just I'm just a
[53:28] manager of it and uh we got to we got to
[53:31] do right by it so um and then um you
[53:35] know I'll go ahead and give this uh this
[53:37] testimony about the virtue and and
[53:40] things like that so what happened was
[53:42] for me one day uh in 20 uh October 2nd
[53:45] of 2015 I went to service on a Friday I
[53:48] was at the bottom Barrel looking up life
[53:51] things were pretty bad for me and uh we
[53:53] were in the midst of a divorce me and my
[53:54] wife
[53:55] and um I said you know what I'm go back
[53:57] to church you know let me try
[54:00] church so I went back and the pastor was
[54:03] there or not the pastor but a minister
[54:04] was in town preaching um uh what was
[54:09] what was his name huh Bill y yeah
[54:11] brother Bill yance anybody know brother
[54:12] Bill y Wild Bill yance yeah he's special
[54:15] to me he's aggressive but uh anyway so
[54:19] he was preaching he was talking about
[54:20] the man at the pool of Bethesda and how
[54:22] he laid in that condition for 38 years
[54:25] and I always thought I had a motorcycle
[54:27] at the time I used to ride a lot of
[54:28] motorcycle stuff like that and I was one
[54:30] of them crazy guys on the highway with
[54:32] one them going 130 M hour but um you
[54:35] know I always thought I was going to die
[54:36] at 38 my my serial number was 38 at the
[54:39] end I just I just thought you know my
[54:42] life was in shambles and stuff like that
[54:44] and uh um but anyway so he come to town
[54:48] he started preaching he he's talking
[54:49] about the man at the P of pesda and and
[54:51] uh he's like man you know that man laid
[54:53] in that POS in that condition for 38
[54:56] years and when he said that there was
[54:58] something moving it started stirring I
[55:00] became that man I became them
[55:02] scriptures and uh I'll tell you what man
[55:06] right there at my seat I metant the shik
[55:10] glory fell down on my face my Bible's
[55:12] ruined I got so much spit and uh tears
[55:16] and all kinds of stuff it burnt the hole
[55:18] in that in that chapter right there but
[55:21] um brother way you got a new Bible I
[55:23] said yeah that other one was beat up but
[55:26] but and then I wanted to get one to
[55:27] where I don't have the the things I got
[55:29] to I can't cheat no more you know what I
[55:32] mean I got to try to find it you know
[55:34] cuz you know we're up here now so I got
[55:36] to try to do more do better right we
[55:38] always got to try to do
[55:40] better so U but anyway the testimony was
[55:44] uh after that had happened I went home
[55:45] and I said hun I said you know when you
[55:48] received the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[55:50] do you um share it with
[55:52] anybody and uh what you say huh just
[55:55] just live the life don't say nothing
[55:58] just live the life that's what she said
[56:00] she always man she always wisdom she
[56:02] always helped me out but um anyway so so
[56:05] I said okay huh so about two weeks later
[56:09] mind you in the in the in the past I was
[56:10] a very involved in sports I like to stay
[56:12] active played a lot of sports I went to
[56:14] all the games Browns games Cav games I
[56:17] was always at games and stuff like that
[56:19] and I always wanted to meet a player get
[56:22] an autograph make eye contact let them
[56:25] hug me you know stuff like that you know
[56:28] now I know what they feel like now when
[56:30] I hug
[56:31] Michael when I when I hug Michael was
[56:33] like hugging LeBron you know so it's
[56:35] like oh that's how big they are all
[56:37] right so you know I always wanted to you
[56:39] know meet somebody or something like
[56:41] that but you know it's a situation to
[56:43] where um about two weeks later after all
[56:45] of this I done gave up I gave up uh all
[56:48] my season tickets I gave up sport I
[56:49] turned the Apple card over we got rid of
[56:51] all our TVs I stopped watching sports um
[56:55] we just focused we barreled down we
[56:56] really did and um uh was I gonna say uh
[57:01] oh I was at Franklin's house that's I
[57:02] was say uh we gave him up in
[57:04] 2015 and in 2016 the Cass won the
[57:08] championship we were laughing we were
[57:10] like that's how it works you know but um
[57:13] so where am I going oh so about two
[57:16] weeks later I walked into a five guys
[57:18] and I was as I was walking up I looked
[57:20] in the the the mirror the windows and
[57:22] there was this big black guy
[57:25] he was a big boy and he kept staring at
[57:28] me so I'm like oh I ain't getting shoved
[57:30] in no garbage can again so I just walked
[57:32] in I walked in like this and I'm walking
[57:35] past him and this big old Mick grabbed
[57:37] me he grabbed me he snatched me out the
[57:39] aisle and pulled me this close like I
[57:42] was this close face to face with him he
[57:44] was sitting down still taller than me
[57:46] and I'm standing up looking at him but
[57:48] he was like where you going little fella
[57:50] I said I'm going to order me a burger
[57:52] and he was like well you look like you
[57:54] going to take over over the world let's
[57:56] talk for a minute and so the first thing
[57:58] come to my mind was my wife said just
[58:00] live it and I'm like but I want to talk
[58:02] to somebody about it so I said let's go
[58:04] to John we turned over and I didn't have
[58:06] my Bible obviously I had my phone so we
[58:08] turned over to first uh John chapter 5 p
[58:12] man of P of Bethesda and so I started
[58:14] telling them about my testimony and all
[58:15] the things and everything we had been
[58:17] through and stuff like that and I guess
[58:19] apparently he was talking to everybody
[58:20] else in there this man was talking to
[58:22] everybody else in there so they were all
[58:23] watching us well we're both crying we're
[58:26] talking about the word we're both crying
[58:28] and uh he stood up at one point he said
[58:30] you guys are all my cousins they must
[58:32] have said cousin or something he said
[58:34] but this man here is my
[58:35] brother and uh and yeah so so we're just
[58:38] talking about the Lord and he says you
[58:40] know I never eat this food I'm on a
[58:42] strict diet but I just wanted to break
[58:44] you know break away and get me a burger
[58:46] from Five Guys he says this was a divine
[58:48] intervention he said keep me in prayer
[58:50] because I'm looking for a wife I want
[58:51] the right wife I want to be married I
[58:53] want the right right
[58:55] so we prayed there together and he left
[58:58] and I went up to the counter and they
[58:59] were like did you know that guy and I'm
[59:02] like uh n he just snatched me out the
[59:04] air I like one of them flies and he he
[59:06] me me but uh he he snatched and they
[59:10] were like well you know he plays for the
[59:11] Browns I'm like oh really and I was like
[59:15] shocked and I ordered my food I walked
[59:16] out of but I started thinking like all
[59:18] these years I wanted to meet one of them
[59:21] but the Lord he had he had it to where
[59:24] you going to meet one and you going to
[59:25] give them a message from
[59:28] me so yeah that was that was
[59:32] nice I never forget that though anybody
[59:35] anybody ever have an experience to where
[59:37] the Lord put you in a place to talk to
[59:39] someone and and it would just something
[59:40] good come out of it yeah yes amen amen
[59:44] so here it says in Genesis 1 128 it says
[59:47] and God blessed them and God said unto
[59:49] them be fruitful and multiply and
[59:52] replenish the Earth and subdue it and
[59:54] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[59:56] and over the fowl of the air and over
[59:58] every living thing that moveth upon the
[1:00:01] Earth in Genesis 2:15 it says and the
[1:00:04] Lord God took the man and put him him
[1:00:06] into the Garden of Eden to dress it and
[1:00:09] keep it be fruitful multiply replenish
[1:00:12] subdue profitable growth increase good
[1:00:16] stewardship let's understand the
[1:00:18] definition of stewardship it says here
[1:00:21] stewardship is the office or duties of
[1:00:23] obligations of a steward the conducting
[1:00:25] supervising or managing of something
[1:00:27] especially the careful and responsible
[1:00:30] management of something entrusted to
[1:00:32] one's care so basically managing
[1:00:34] something that isn't yours remember
[1:00:37] everything belongs to God everything in
[1:00:39] your possession belongs to God you came
[1:00:41] into this world with nothing and you
[1:00:43] leave out this world with nothing even
[1:00:46] even in the body
[1:00:47] change I put here you won't be taking
[1:00:49] your
[1:00:51] timolin all of all of us one day will
[1:00:53] stand in judgment and and and give
[1:00:56] account of what we did with ourselves
[1:00:58] you know so that that's why earlier I
[1:01:00] was talking about you know having um
[1:01:02] bitterness and things like that we have
[1:01:04] to those things have to be gone we got
[1:01:06] we got to shed those things we got to
[1:01:07] get rid of those things and and
[1:01:09] sometimes it's going to come you it's
[1:01:10] it's going to cause you to be in
[1:01:12] humility right because you're going to
[1:01:14] feel like well I ain't the one in Fault
[1:01:16] right but you know what Jesus wasn't at
[1:01:20] fault right in fact he didn't even say
[1:01:23] nothing
[1:01:25] I mean this man that thought he had
[1:01:26] power was looking at the man who gave
[1:01:28] him the power and you know he's he's
[1:01:30] said what do you got to say for yourself
[1:01:31] he had nothing to say cuz he was
[1:01:34] thinking about you you know Lord he was
[1:01:37] looking he was looking past the crowds
[1:01:39] and he was looking into this Dimension
[1:01:40] looking at this church right now all
[1:01:42] these people sitting
[1:01:43] here
[1:01:45] amen it says I've never believed that in
[1:01:48] heaven was a place where there's a bunch
[1:01:49] of buildings there's a bunch of houses
[1:01:51] up there they're made with mortar d with
[1:01:54] paper paint on the wall I've never
[1:01:56] believed that supernatural being would
[1:01:58] have to live in a literal house I
[1:02:00] believe when Jesus spoke in John 14 he
[1:02:03] said in my father's house as many
[1:02:05] mansions he meant a body a dwelling
[1:02:08] place for the scriptures verify the same
[1:02:10] thing says if this Earthly Tabernacle be
[1:02:13] dissolved I will have one already
[1:02:15] waiting you see mortal beings is the
[1:02:17] only one who lives in Mortal habitations
[1:02:20] Immortal beings live in Immortal
[1:02:22] habitations then the place that will go
[1:02:24] into until we return back is not a place
[1:02:26] of brick mortar and clay and precious
[1:02:28] stones or Jewels it's a place of
[1:02:32] condition right it's a place of
[1:02:34] condition we have to condition ourselves
[1:02:36] now right because because D I think Dad
[1:02:39] mentioned it earlier but we have to we
[1:02:41] have to do here to match there right
[1:02:45] amen I remember Jesus praying in John
[1:02:47] said I think it was John 17 he's saying
[1:02:50] he's saying as as it is in heaven as it
[1:02:53] is here let that it also be also in
[1:02:55] heaven you know what I mean so there's a
[1:02:56] matching that needs to to go
[1:02:58] on so it says uh in here in Romans 8:23
[1:03:03] not only so but we ourselves who have
[1:03:06] have the first fruits of the spirit
[1:03:08] grown inwardly as we wait eagerly for
[1:03:12] our adoption to sunship the Redemption
[1:03:15] of our bodies and that's what the that's
[1:03:18] what I believe brother Wade you're
[1:03:19] coming up through now and stuff like
[1:03:20] that so that's great um I have to get in
[1:03:23] my studies and and and learn more myself

[1:12:46] brother way I think that's good so what
[1:12:49] I do call you up now
[1:12:51] or the musician is already up here
[1:12:55] so all
[1:13:03] right list he asked me the first service
[1:13:06] after first service he said how' I do I
[1:13:07] said wor sermon I
[1:13:10] have yeah he
[1:13:13] did I said that's pretty good that's
[1:13:15] what Dr Davis said about brother brandom
[1:13:17] okay so he got his start that way why
[1:13:19] can't he get his start that
[1:13:20] way you know you cry at funerals you
[1:13:23] make people cry Wedding made people
[1:13:25] brother R said I made them cry you
[1:13:28] didn't even make him
[1:13:30] cry let's give him another good
[1:13:37] hand you know sometimes we forget um
[1:13:41] brother John that when we started that
[1:13:45] Journey it was a tender time where
[1:13:47] everything was like was important and
[1:13:50] I'm not saying it's not important but I
[1:13:52] when we walked into that at
[1:13:54] um in the dad's hunting closet which is
[1:13:57] huge and and I forgot they were there
[1:14:00] and there's a stack sure enough they
[1:14:02] probably from
[1:14:05] 1996 to to 2000 cassette tape so there's
[1:14:09] a stack that's big sitting on the floor
[1:14:11] and I just walked around him you know
[1:14:13] for all the time of getting stuff for
[1:14:14] that and him getting stuff he I didn't
[1:14:16] forgot he stored them in there but I
[1:14:19] knew that it meant something to them
[1:14:21] when they were like
[1:14:23] you know I'm looking at the hunting
[1:14:25] stuff I'd be looking at the hunting
[1:14:26] stuff they're going what's
[1:14:30] that I said what's that rich
[1:14:33] said what's that I said this cassette
[1:14:37] tape and they're like what's underneath
[1:14:39] this
[1:14:43] floor I said the garage they said drill
[1:14:46] a hole up through the I told Mom last
[1:14:49] night I when we left I said Mom if you
[1:14:50] hear something sound
[1:14:52] like
[1:14:54] I said they going to be downstairs
[1:14:55] stealing them tapes but that meant
[1:14:58] something to them like with us it was
[1:15:00] just something we walk by come on
[1:15:02] somebody it's like something we walk by
[1:15:05] didn't even look at it didn't even
[1:15:06] notice it but it meant a lot to them
[1:15:09] this ministry meant a lot to people you
[1:15:11] know we we laugh about it about people
[1:15:14] you know sleeping and stuff here but but
[1:15:17] uh but God's word will never return
[1:15:22] void will accomplish as you heard
[1:15:24] brother Keith Reed stand right here he's
[1:15:26] going to Africa and preach now and and
[1:15:29] that he's preaching away and he he
[1:15:31] listens to to some of Dad's old tapes
[1:15:33] and then now or old sermons and and so
[1:15:36] he goes over there and he's preaching on
[1:15:37] a a subject and two or three ministers
[1:15:41] walk up to him and
[1:15:43] say we know where you got that from he
[1:15:47] said why he said we said we got brother
[1:15:48] Dale's tapes over here
[1:15:52] Africa
[1:15:53] [Applause]
[1:15:55] so
[1:15:56] um it won't return void it'll accomplish
[1:15:59] exactly what it said it would accomplish
[1:16:02] amen and like brother Keith readed
[1:16:04] always said he told Brother Dale he said
[1:16:05] brother Dale you're not always preaching
[1:16:07] just right here that's right he said
[1:16:08] you're preaching to the world right same
[1:16:11] way with all of us too like brother
[1:16:12] Isaac was saying I mean and that's true
[1:16:15] that that's really not for us right do
[1:16:17] you understand what he meant it was for
[1:16:19] others to see that in us that I see it
[1:16:22] in myself is really selfish it's
[1:16:24] something I see no but if somebody will
[1:16:26] see it in
[1:16:27] me as as with as brother Franklin you
[1:16:30] know you last time you I saw him you
[1:16:32] know he's um tatted up and t-shirt on
[1:16:35] and shorts on and I'm like man where did
[1:16:38] they get that
[1:16:41] guy I did offer you to be baptized
[1:16:43] though I did and you almost did but it
