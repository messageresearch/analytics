lot more tomorrow Ain God [Music] good amen let's give him a hand clap of Praise ain't God good to give us so many blessings only the redeemed know how to worship Him nobody else knows how to worship him you know I was going down the road yesterday and thinking about some things and a thought come where brother brand said that you know it come to the end time to where that people will cry out for Jesus and say Jesus Jesus and not even and and they'll be saying it to somebody El else they won't be saying it to the the man that we know this Jesus that's what the Bible says the Bible tells us that that um that you will U call on his name and he'll say I never knew you depart from me I never knew you I did this I did that I preached good sermons heal the sick cast out Devils he said depart from you I never had a personal relationship with you so that personal relationship is the most important thing to have with the Lord amen remember all these announcements I know brother Ryan's um give them to you but this coming Wednesday brother Eric guo will be with us for um Wednesday night one more time then you remember the rest of the rest of the uh what's going on all the happening going on the next couple of months so again be careful this week this week coming up they just posted another um where it's supposed to be Arctic Blast coming down into the South so just uh watch your water pipes and let your water run a little bit maybe at night time or something but it's not supposed to get one day but like 30° the high so um um if you got any pets bring them in horse yeah bring your horses and Donnie go right ahead we'll pray for you we'll come well I was going to say we come and see the mess afterwards but no I don't think so I think we'll just stay here thank you so we're good we knew where we knew where that was going so we're okay but uh just remember that and be wise and um and do the right thing and and not have problems with you water and all that other stuff so let's bow our heads Lord thank you for communing with us today Lord the first service and now father I pray that you would once again Lord just as the Bible says set us in Heavenly places Lord where we can hear from you father we pray that you'd be with the ones Lord that are sick that are not here Lord that that are uh watching in maybe now Lord I pray that you'd be with them touch them Lord give them strength give us all strength for this journey Lord we praise you great name for all the things you have done for us and the things that are coming up Lord I pray that you'd be with us keep your Mighty hand on this church Lord and and the family Lord that's that calls this place home for father I pray that you'd be with each one Lord give us Revelation more than anything more than anything Lord reveal yourself to us and we will be a better group of people and we We Praise Your Great Name thank you for letting us even hear this message much l be a part of it thank you for just letting us have an ear to hear and an eye to see Lord thank you so much this this 1% is about it and then the other 99 oh my word Lord It's judgment for them father thank you for putting us in your Pavilion thank you for giving us an opportunity Lord now let us listen to you for just a few minutes in Jesus name we pray amen the Bible says in the beginning was the word this will be part five and then we'll begin with the uh Church ages um starting probably next Sunday if you want to read the church AE book just go ahead and read it and uh and get you a uh get your head start on the curriculum so John 1:1 in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the word was God and that same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be SE in the Lord His blessings to the reading of the word Colossians 1:12 as we were saying this morning Paul is the way he articulates this is just so important because he's he's talking to the Colossians he said give thanks giving thanks unto the Father which made us meet to be partakers as I was praying just now we have been made to be partakers of this great Gospel of this great um Revelation in this hour that that 99% of the world's not even privileged to as we were talking about Wednesday night there's many cities that that I go through when I go to Illinois and you know hunting and like Paduka and beautiful places that you think man they need not a church there at all right a church there at all brother Brandon preached in Elizabeth Town which is not far from where we from where we go um Kentucky but other than that nothing they got the big Bible schools and the big colleges and all those things and God know where to be seen be glad that's right you better thank God every day that he's even give you an opportunity not just that you're doing it but he gave you an opportunity to hear that's right what he said in this hour he give it to us now I ask you what are you going to do with it what are we going to do with it all right it's our responsibility now though that he gave it to us more is what more is given more is required all right so we can't say we don't we we don't know we're going to act like them out there because we don't understand no no no we've been called to a higher plane amen and when we read the Bible we read it with more as Paul wrote it in in so much Zeal we should read it in so much Zeal that it's it's the Eternal Word of God it'll never change it'll always be there so let's look at verse 13 WHO hath delivered us from the power of darkness and have translated us as we were talking this morning transpose or transfer remove from one place to another now he didn't remove your soul and put another one in and he didn't take your soul and put it somewhere else no just that that old adamic nature that old as we were talking this morning that cloud that brother Bri said come in and and clouded up and muddied up that that soul that you were born with perfect kids but you had to come to time of the place to where you knew right and wrong and then right and wrong you either keep the cloud there or you get rid of the cloud one of the two all right so there's a cloud of Darkness that's on all of us if we're not born again all right but thank God we've been translated as Paul said into the kingdom of his dear son so we've been translated into a kingdom not just a not just a church but a kingdom we've been translated into that and whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature not the second person of the Trinity come on that's right CU that's the world thinks that he's the second person of the Trinity no he's the firstborn of every creature the invisible God the Creator Jesus Christ amen we know him as that now for by him were all things created in heaven Earth visible invisible Thrones dominions principalities Powers all things were created by Him and for him now remember what does Satan do he perverts everything that God creates all right and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body of the church now like I said this morning Paul now has brought it down to tell the Colossians hey there is a great God there is a a a Creator there is one that did all this and made everything you see but he's right here now but he's right here he's not over there he's right here and he's the head of the body of the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell and like we were talking about this morning with Adam Adam was Adam was a created being he he had a a body that as brother R said it looked like a a tree sticking in the ground his toes went into the ground cuz see that's where Adam came up out of the 16 elements of the earth and God just pulled his body up and and I held it there for a little while and throw that uh breath and he became a living person then he breathed into his nostrils and he became a living Soul as we were talking about this morning Eternal spiritually he breathed into him and made him an eternal person with God that we read that this morning so you and I though are born as a baby then we have to come up and then we have a breath a natural breath that we breathe and then we have a spiritual breath that when we come to the baptism of the Holy Ghost he breathes on us as he did at Pentecost he breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost and then on the day of Pentecost that became a reality all right they breathed the Breath of God the Church of God is born of the Breath of God God breathed breath into the nostril spiritually of Adam and he became a living Soul did you know the Pentecostals or true Pentecostal church is born by the Breath of God he went all the way back to Pentecost to tell us that originally that Pentecostal group we'll look at it when we get into the church ages that's the way the church was supposed to been set up amen all right that was the way it supposed to been set up and what happened it got eroded down through the church ages those two spirits come back in together come on somebody and they actually resided sometimes right together and rode their s all the way through those Church ages till we come to the end time where a prophet of God had to say nope there goes one going that way here stands the Lamb with a book in his hand so therefore that can't be God can't be two people one's got to be God one's got to be the devil remember when he said if you see two people one's God and one's the devil all right so that's what he was telling us and and even Jesus had told us in Matthew 24 he said Beware false Christ first thing right off the GetGo we'll read it here in just a few minutes but we know now I hope we everybody understands that the logos is the speech of God and the theophany is the form that God took so that you and I can understand who he is and then as brother bandam says one time he calls him King theophany that theophany is where you and I emanate from that are born again amen you understand me that are born again cuz everybody emanates from God by breath and by life right I read the SC I read it where brother Brown said he gives you a soul and a spirit all right but it's not Eternal right but until he gets to the age of accountability it's covered all right and all babies go to heaven as we were talking about this morning I hope you see that and I hope you appreciate that I appreciate what God's done like that to put people in heaven when they really didn't have a place for them amen amen really but he said no all babies brother said no all babies go to heaven do we understand that but that theophany was the word body and then that word body when he put part of it in Adam he was getting ready now to put the rest of it through Adam everybody with me through Adam and Eve were going to produce God's children amen right had there not been a fall but now since there was a fall he Adam and Eve and then he had to stop cuz it was not they become unworthy that cloud came down and came between them and it became so Smoky to to God couldn't see sin anymore so he put the atonement there of a blood of an animal to to not take away but to cover sin until he could come and take away sin all right is everybody with me on that that's just Elementary but we got to get to that John 1:8 says no man has seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he ha declared him or unfolded a teach Jesus stood that day it just I see how brother Brandon was frustrated sometimes we all get frustrated but I know how Jesus was frustrated he was he was talking to the most religious people yeah chosen people he told his disciples don't go out there he said go to these people right here they're my people that's right right the Jewish people they're my people go to the house of Israel and try to save them and they're the ones that hung him on the cross he stood in their church and preached and they got so mad at him they tried to Stone him kicked him out of every synagogue there was and he was preaching the unadulterated word of God he was saying where have I missed it where have I missed it take all the Old Testament y'all know you know I know he looked at me said look y'all know the Old Testament he said I it but they hated him for saying that he said before before Abraham was I am well he would took him all the way back to Abraham right that's when they said oh you're not even 50 years old how'd you get back there how' Abraham see you he said Abraham actually wanted to see this day right and see all the prophets now as they're standing they're over into their Dimension they wanted to see this day cuz Isaiah and all the different ones that can look and see and could see way up into the future to hear right here and Jesus stood one day and he said have I not declared everything that my father told y'all in other words Jehovah god Jehovah God told y'all all this he said but you know what he said you acting just like you're supposed to because your fathers put my prophets in the tombs right so you're going to in other words so you're going to put me in there too cuz you're mad at me too then Paul stands one day and he said look are y'all mad at me because I tell you the truth he got mad at Jesus so they're going to get mad at you they're going to get mad at me anybody else just stands here and tells the truth right to recount or rehearse Jesus was God and he the father whatever the father was inside of him when it moved he moved right man cuz listen as some say that Jesus wasn't god Till The River Jordan I was thinking about this yesterday so now if brother Brandon if we take got an itch where's my wife she'll be home in a little bit she's on her way she's in a she's out of Augusta now so she's she'll be on her way in a few minutes but um forgot my thought we'll get back to it a minut John 14:16 said I'll pray the father and he'll give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth this is what I added in because of so important that that Jesus had to go away had to go away he said it's expedient that I must leave you right cuz I can't come back and stand in your temple by myself and do these works right I'm going to have to declare them through you and I can't be here at the same time so I'm going to send a comforter the spirit of Truth whom the look whom the world cannot receive so if you're born again today the world can't receive you the world can't they don't they don't understand because it seeth him not neither knoweth him and there Jesus was declaring him the whole time never came any other way but what the scripture says so will you if we be become born again and we start living the word of God that's Jesus Christ walking in human flesh again whether you believe that or not prophet of God said deity now resides in us I have to believe what he says I can't believe what I say I have to believe what he says all right but you know him now look because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you all right I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost today he has come to you to not just anoint you but to reside in you amen yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but You See Me Now list listen that got locked up that got locked up at nah cuz they saw him as one God right here when the Holy Ghost came back on the day of Pentecost they were not trinitarians but 300 years later at Nia and then 600 years after that they adopted it will come a saying a deed and a Doctrine we'll get into it in just a little bit with the with the church ages that's why we really got to cover that to show again how that thing got got separated and how how Satan came right back in and run right along with the bride and has until this day that's why brother R said you got a church over here and I got a bride over here this is the characteristics of the two but you see me because I live you shall live also at that day the prophet of God said this day you shall know where I'm at and what I'm doing where I'm at that's pretty much what he says here okay at that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you do we believe that amen do you believe that s when you get up you can't hardly move your hand CU it's all numb I thought I was the only one it went through that man I can't I can't hold nothing I it just they have to sit there and shake it and anyhow good to be alive he that have my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will look and will manifest myself to him that's why God came to you at the new birth he not only gave you the new birth he gave you this messag yes amen he came to you knowing you'd be one of the only ones that would take it and take it to heart right right Judah said unto him now not as carrot Lord Lord how is it that thou will manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world Jesus answered and said if a man love me he will keep my words pretty simple listen I I thinking about yesterday we we can have all these great Revelations okay we we and we do yet we can't come to church can't study can't read our Bible can't can't pray we can't we can't do the simple things take communion wash and all those things there's no way you'll ever go higher than that without those institutions being put in your life right you can't listen this ain't a skip gospel this ain't a I get to go past the third grade because I'm smart no you got to go through the third grade fourth grade fifth grade sixth grade justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness you can't skip to where I'm perfect if you ever think you too perfect to go to church or take communion you're lost that's right the devil has got you he's not playing with you he's got you cuz he plays with me all the time you really don't need to go up there they not even paying attention to you and they going to fall asleep so I can service if a man loved me he will keep my words we're going to keep going right Don he go put a put a put your ink pin right there and my father will love him and we will look and we will come unto you and take our Abode with him right he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings so sisters I think it is all right to just put a little makeup on and splash a little this and and and cut a little this and now that ain't his words so you're out of the Gospel sorry you're out of it so you're not doing his words you don't love him enough oh don't tell me see there the devil's already got you am did Jesus ever say it's just really hard to do what the father tells me to do no he said I always do it right why because the father was in him and he let him have preeminence that's our problem is we get ourself in the way and we think remember I told you many times before if somebody ever comes to me and says I thought pretty much you're going to have to explain again what you're talking about he that loveth me not you'll remember that he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which you hear is not mine all right now listen there's two words there's two Powers the devils and gods he said if you're not listening to mine you're listening to the devils right and The Words which you hear is not mine but the Father which sent me these things have I spoken unto you being yet present with you now look but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost he puts it right down where it's at whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid we're going fixing to go through some Troublesome times the world's getting worse and worse they're saying this coming October I we're reading some about that there's going to be a crash again and um another housing bubble crash and all that stuff and so what big deal we got to go through itless we get out of here before that we should be fine with me but we're prepared for for it listen this world when they go through something you watch them when they start going through something they they number one they start going to church again but you know some kind of disaster like 9/11 boy 911 when 911 hit Heavenly days the churches was full of people National Day of Prayer when they took it out of the schools and said it was illegal they had a whole nation come and pray because of this disaster that happened then what about a year later it was then another year later and it's well now they're empty again right you and I should not be that way sure we're going to have troubles we're going to have ups and downs always but we know the end there's an end to this everybody with me just a minute let me get off my message just man there's an end to this we're we're looking at something and we're not not but Paul said I even look through a glass Darkly cuz he wasn't in an open book you and I are in the open book we know what age we're living in we know what time we know what's happening we know who's already com and who's already left and we know where the devil is what else you need to know we know where God is he's in us okay so we know the devil is out there trying to what trying to stop listen brother R said he's trying to what stop the program of God now you and I are the program of God believe it or not if you're born again today you have a part in the program of God hallelujah they realize that amen and there's a plan for you to go through this not meet your end Hallelujah and listen be called out of all that Hallelujah come on called out completely out of that oh we might have to go through who knows we have to go through a little persecution Moses stood one day and Moses I'm sure inside of Moses he was like man I spent 40 years they trained me for 40 years to take over my mama told me when I was a baby that I was chosen for a job am I right then when he hit about 40 years old he got SC R by he was actually the next Pharaoh in line so he was like you know he had a church with 6 or 800 people oh never mind he was the head Bishop he was the head Bishop right but he still had a temper right and he killed an Egyptian and that wiped out all back he had to go running back to the desert and God brother R said God had to take every bit of that out of him because he was schooled as my dad's always said and I believe it 100% that's why Pharaoh didn't have him killed now listen if you was to come up to a pharaoh I don't care who you were he can have his wife killed and nobody say anything about it Kings had their wives head cut off all the time be careful but but here's Moses walks right up and says Let My People Go and Pharaoh's like didn't mean you grow up together right did didn't you weren't you trained didn't my daddy which is rames didn't my daddy said he didn't my daddy train you and where You' been you've been gone for 40 years Moses said I had to get all that knocked out of me he said but I'm ready to take over now he said how he said here I am God don't worry about numbers but still Pharaoh thought man he might have some friends still in that little cap you know his little circle of friends over here he said he may still have some generals over here or something he might he might cause me a little oh Moses going then he kept playing with him yeah you can let him go then then he changed his mind that morning or that night he changed his mind of course he could he's a pharaoh but there was one day when Moses god through Moses took that place to its knees right he took all that schooling out of him but the Bible tells us in Hebrews 11 it says Moses if you read it read it just like you're standing there with Moses here's Moses he's able to take he probably was able to take over without having all these Mighty Miracles he could he could have mounted an army took most of the Israelites and and had an Insurrection and took half of the Egyptians with him because they all like Moses I'm sure they did at first but the Bible says Moses for all that he threw it away so that he could listen to what God Said can you and I do that can we throw away everything that's important to us esteem that just nothing but just part of life and the riches and all those things Moos they said he said Paul said Moses just said no I want to serve Christ amen can we do that that's Hebrews that's Hebrews 11 that's how Moses put his faith in what God said can we do that now Moses didn't have the new birth you and I have the new birth we should be able to do that a lot more than he did cuz deity lays in you it deity lays in me me and you and as sister Anna I brought I left this in here for sister Anna marunga because she was talking to me down downstairs she said you don't mean just a regular Jubilee you mean a golden jubilee yes I've me 50 years of the golden jubilee it's okay so some of you that didn't understand that you have a jubilee ever seven years and we'll cover that in the church ages but there comes a place to where at the 49th year you have one more you have a jubilee golden jubilee 50th Jubilee where everything goes free right and we'll we'll get through that but I I just want to make you understand that yes you're right sister that is the golden jubilee I'm talking about this right here now we're living under the golden jubilee as our brother said the other day the seven sevens is gone we're in an eight 77 is 49 that's not going to take you to a 50 you got one more you got that eternity you got that eight so that we'll get to that but there'll come another Year of Jubilee that's why brother Randon was looking at he not a not a not one we got to go over we have to go we don't have to go to Israel we're having it inside of oursel right it's a a golden jubilee that this this guy can go free that's what we're looking at this guy can go free listen man has talked about this and talked about it job stood one day and he said in my flesh I'll see God Amen though the skin worms destroy this body in my flesh I shall see God so he was looking to somewhere that death had to be destroyed somewhere job had enough Revelation to be able to see that do we cuz we've got the formula right job didn't have the formula we have the formula that's right in our hands right now they coming Another Year of Jubilee and that we've had it just about this time now he's talking about a natural Jubilee going from Pentecost he says when you get begin to see the Year of Jubilee now not the seven sevens that's what we're going to cover in the church ages and you'll hear brother rown say he says they couldn't get all the way out what do you mean by that they left a leg in or an arm in no they brought some Doctrine with them right and he's telling the Pentecostals you brought some Doctrine with you that you shouldn't have right like you got to speak in tongues to get the Holy Ghost and you got to do this and got to do that right but when you begin to see the Year of Jubilee where we don't have to fuss and strain and pull like this but we're already secured in Christ we already have the name of the Lord Jesus in baptism now he keeps going through the great Mysteries that we're going to bring up in the Seven Seals and prove to you then was the seals that were sealed from the eyes of the people nobody saw what we see nobody thank God he sent us a prophet cuz that Prophet went into the mind of God and brought that open book that's right he stood there one day and he said here stands a lamb with a book in his hand and there goes the white horse rider then he starts preaching and his preaching for the next 2 and a half to three years before his death he was he's pulling it apart now wait he preached United time and sign that was us and Christ back together but he he preached anointed ones at the end time all the different ones Mighty God unveiled before us he was separating pulling it apart so that we can see our pathway and our way to go so Revelations 3:14 is the beginning of the creation of God I hope you see that that you and I are a continuation as he said a continuation of that creation but being in in that in that what was dispensation of the beginning of the creation of God he claims your body the word of God has not stood in a pull pit and claimed your body until this day right nobody that is the beginning of the creation of God and this is the continuation oh listen folks let's don't let brother Brown's message be be null and void don't let the message of the hour be null and void I'm going read just one here in a few minutes I read to you Wednesday night brother BR said when my religion starts getting dull I'll read it to you the whole Redemptive plan you and I have now everything the whole plan of God Ezekiel 18:20 says the soul that sinth it shall die the son shall not bear the iniquity of the fathers we were talking this morning so you're an individual person you absolutely have to get it on your own as far as the Holy Ghost now you need helpers and all that the comforter but I can't give you the Holy Ghost you got to accept it right all right the soul that sinth it shall die the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father NE shall the father bear the iniquity of the son the righteous of the righteous shall be upon Him righteousness and the wickedness of the wickedness shall be upon him separated all right when you stand before judgment I hope none of you in this building have to stand before the white Throne judgment you're going to give an account as an individual you're not going to give an account because your preacher held you back your mama held you back no you held you back for what is a man Prophet us if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul I was thinking this this week about about that very subject and then uh Lis you know brother Lis he talks about 10,000 worlds brother Brown said one Soul was worth that you know I think about a couple of Great Men and and I'm talking about men men that were in the world like um well just to be truthful we got Daddy a bunch of Bonanza videos and we've been watching bananza videos so anyway you got Little Joe if everybody knows who that is that was Michael Landon well Michael Landon was worth you know h100 million dollar he got pancreatic cancer and 3 months later he died all that Fame and Fortune and all that money I'm sure he poured and then you look at other people that you look at Steve Jobs he was a multi-billionaire the the owner of Apple created Apple what you're using now he was the creator of it him and wnc and all the different ones what was he at where was he at okay but he gets cancer I'm sure he spends hundreds of thousands of dollars for his body body but I don't know that he ever stopped and said God forgive my soul and when he died his soul went somewhere his millions stayed here right and a lot of Great Men you see how their life was cut short money could not buy or purchase that's right enough to reverse that right but if they would have stopped just a minute and said God and I hope they did I hope that but it was never recorded that they did that they would give their heart to the Lord then 10,000 worlds just popped up and there's no way to there's no way to put a value on that same way with us there's no way to put a value there listen there's no way put a no way to put a value on your worship if you know who you're worshiping and he loves that worship there's no there's no value you can't say I got a 401K with $110 million in it if you don't know the Lord you got zero in your bank account in heaven right but our souls on his Altar and look what happens when you get the new birth you're conceived a new there is a conception right you are conceived a new you was first conceived in iniquity now you're conceived in something new what is it the Living Word right amen amen H all that changes it now doesn't it now we're through the struggle after seeing what you got to do now what happens you're conceived and new and the Living Word what is it the word becomes alive in you so what someone preaches are you here brother brandom or you hear a a Minister preach and it's the word of God and you say that ain't nothing but the truth that makes the word become alive inside of you amen it's dead as long as it lays on that page right how many have you ever been sitting somewhere and you said I see that that wasn't the devil that was not the devil cuz he's over there trying to put the blinders on you and you're over there going I see that well that's God and now listen hang on to that go to the next step hang on to that go to the next step hang on to that sir everybody with me where once you couldn't see that now you do see it there's something different now makes all the scriptures come together makes everything dovetail just right ain't that true if we read the Bible if you were a denomination or you in a denominational Church you read the Bible like a denominational told you to to read it right but we read the same Bible now we see there's no eternal hell we see there's no father son Holy Ghost baptism we see these things why we read the same Bible but we read it with what we read it with something different the scales of our eyes have been pulled back we're going to see that in the church ages that that the scales were pulled back but there was always a part there that Satan and I hate to say this but he had so much control over the church during the church ages we'll talk about it and I hate to say that but part of the plan part of the plan of God he's not nervous that's right he didn't now didn't see that no he saw everything and listen so he knows how to navigate through all that he's God he sees the end from the beginning Satan doesn't I think Satan just reacts to a spirit maybe then now something begins to happen now you die to your own thinking now you're conceived cuz you're Washed by the Water of the word what do you do with a baby as soon as it's born you give it a bath you wash it and as soon as a man has died to himself and born of God he's Washed by the Water of the word and brother Brown tells us say now you have your training you thought man I'm done I'm finished no just get you started what have we been talking about for hund and something services this is our training now and it's not it may start as child training but it's going to be an adult training adult training class a little bit different than child training class you're ready to go into training now child training that's where you get started that's the hard part when you think you ought to do this and the word Cuts you around shows you something else let me ask you a question how many times that ever happened amen you had your own idea you knew that's what scripture said you knew that's what brother vam said and somebody come in and preach something to you and you go I don't see it that way anymore right right well you know what that was God that was not the devil cuz he'd want you to stay in the error and the word Cuts you around and shows you something else while they believe that over that don't make any difference what they believe right here's what God Said and you must be about the father's business now you're getting born again now you're getting right getting straightened out you have a new parent so in order if you're born again and got a new parent then you got a new nature the old nature is dead and you got a new nature you once was going one way now you going another you once was going down now you're going up your affections are set on things above a new affection listen when you got born again you had an affection for God that you never had before right but it was in child training here now watch him he says now your affections are set on things above a new affection okay you don't love the things of the world no more your affections are of God all these statue of perfect man all the way up there to Holy Spirit now you got a new effect now we're getting into something different we're getting into some deep water hope you learn how to swim the last 10 and something sermons cuz we got to keep moving on I see some of the Tabernacle folks here I'm going to say this about the big sister Tabernacle one thing that the Tabernacle needs is more up there at our church at the Tabernacle at Jeffersonville and I'm sorry to say you can't even get in it now they don't even have church services there going to turn into a museum is what we heard so old relics I don't want old relics that's come on give me something fresh amen that's right it's a rededication and a refilling of the Holy Ghost that's right everyone to get down to the Altar and pray until they get a renewing of the Holy Ghost and I want to say something real quick we open these doors from 5 to 6 o'clock some of you come some of you ain't never showed your face here you're missing something amen especially those of you that have a job here those of you that have a job here everybody looks at you as a spiritual leader because you have a job to do you should be here you should be here for Bible study I've told you that before you look at me weird if you want to but people watch you and says well why is this so why is he not here if he does this or does this I'm just saying it's not required but he'd be nice if you come cuz you know what you're probably going to do something else like Dad said you going to go to Walmart on Saturday night well it gets some quiet now where you can hear the fans doing this but you know is that not the truth brother Brown said every time that door opens he said you should want to come to get in them that's exactly so is he still your Prophet or not did he change it's just old now we don't have to believe that it don't change the whole church be filled with the power of God that's what we need not only the Tabernacle but the body of Christ Universal it needs a refilling I like David said one day restore to me the joy of my salvation now he had not lost his salvation but the joy of it and when it comes to a place that I can enjoy my religion my salvation there's something wrong somewhere because it is a joy unspeakable and full of glory amen you look at the world and we're all guilty of this you you turn on a a TV and you you watch a ball game I mean 80 to 100,000 people they go to their church and they don't miss a ball game service they dress in their team colors some of them have them tattooed on their naked chest and at 12 degrees outside and they shout the whole service and you never see one of them fall asleep hello somebody now you're not going to get popcorn and a drink in here like they do but that's their church service that's their God that's what they feed off of EXA what do we do and I'm guilty too I mean that's a fervor to me what brother Brown that's why that's a fervor that's a fervor of wanting to come to church and like brother R said I want this Joy unspeakable amen amen when it comes to a place that I can't enjoy my religion my salvation there's something wrong somewhere we need a rededication a refilling this year we're not going to make it without it right let me say something too this uniting time to see the church is uniting Nations uniting it's a uniting time of God and his bride too praise the Lord and I say this with reverence and respect I believe that the bride of Christ is called I believe she is sealed in the kingdom of God now a lot of people would say that would be that he said this you know that we're ready to go he doesn't mean that he means the kingdom that she the bride is sealed into the kingdom of God now we've got things that we've got to understand to go to the body change we're not sealed in what I'm saying is a lot of people said Redemption was over in 1963 like a whole group says now that well not now but they've said forever that that Jesus came in 1963 so we don't have to take communion anymore well I want you to read that communion scripture just one more time he says I not drink this until I drink it in my kingdom now if he's come he should already be here and he'd be drinking the wine right no he's here in the word amen he's not here in physical form right so communion is part of what you're supposed to do but that's where people get their idea that in 1963 they told Dad when he come in in 1968 or 69 they said hey Redemption is over you can't be saved because of certain script certain things that brother Ram said right but we know one thing for sure in 1963 90% of y'all wasn't even born but the ones of us that were Donnie born in 1949 he's he's a 49er y'all know that 1949 if you had a 1949 car it'd be okie dokie then okay sure he has a 1949 car but look we're sealed into the kingdom when you get the new birth all right so most of us weren't born some of us were I was three all right but Redemption wasn't over or we just empty this church and go to the house and go to a ball game with our shirt off and our favorite number tattoo on our chest but it's not if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost today yes you are sealed in your king in the kingdom of God but now there's work to do amen I believe the mechanics is there they're waiting for the Dynamics that'll take her off the earth into Glory now that's what he's talking about in The Rapture I believe it with all my heart yes sir we don't know how he's going to do it but he shall do it he's the Dynamics we just become members of the machine of his body I like what he says we read this about this machine forming oursel into his image and see him uniting himself with us in his works with his love gifts look as he hands them to us just before the wedding supper now remember see we get married down here we go to a wedding supper all right and we're waiting and watching for that their big church is to be United the D dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit that we have look worked in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when that head and body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost would raise her up just exactly like that even the dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds of years will rise in the beauty of his Holiness and take a flight to the skies look the Dynamics is the holy spirit once more Lord 1963 brother Ram said in my travels I find two classes of people one of them are fundamentals positionally they know by the mechanics that they are to be Sons and Daughters of God all right everybody with me you got to keep your eyes open to read and I said the the next I find is the Pentecostals they with the baptism of the Holy Spirit but I said the fundamentalists positionally know where they're at but they don't have any faith in the word right and the Pentecostals has got a lot of faith but don't know who they are and I said it's like a man that had money in the bank he could not write a but could not write a check one could write a check but not on money in the bank if you could get the them two together excuse me he said well that makes them act like that I said it's letting off the steam what makes them act like that I I don't maybe that's what we ought to call it letting off steam you know how we let off steam at at home and work and all those different things what we do either go outside and scream and holler and we ought to do that here maybe let off some steam Shout praise the Lord I said it's letting off the steam I said now I don't think that would have to be necessary but they've got to vent somewhere I wish we had enough pressure in us to make his vent and I said now if they would just take all that Steam and know how to direct it fundamentally in the word the big regime of of God would start moving on there is where Satan got in to make it all mechanics and no Dynamics back all Dynamics and no mechanics see we've got to put it together we've got the power of the Holy Spirit but we've got to come back with a word to feed this machine we can't feed it on Creeds it won't burn it chokes up the flu and it'll it will not burn it it was made for the word of God you were made for the word of God Amen man shall not live by bread alone but by every word not just part of it every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God now sees not air with a sh see not close it is now we're getting ready to head to Matthew 24 here just for a second then we'll close now Matthew 24:24 said the two spirits in the last days look the church Spirit of the church people and by the way me the church Spirit of the churchy churchy people and the bride Spirit of the Bride people amen would be so close I went like this now he's going to bring them back like this he said we'll be so close together till it would deceive the very elect if it was possible that's how close revelation of Jesus Christ it's a church age book where we're heading to now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts I could almost quote this verbatim we read it so many times but the Book of Revelations now look where did we see the church ages started in the Book of Revelations when we start in the book of Revelations we're going to start in Revelation chapter 1 but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his work the attempted destruction of God's people and discrediting of God's word right down to the time he has cast to the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian Church Christian Church this is not some Christian church and by God's spirit the only way you're going to be able to do it discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her he would be as definitely thwarted today as when Christ with stod his every effort to gain power over him in the desert Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them all right let's read Matthew 24 start verse 23 I like what brother Donaldo said about this you know you got your two Spirits 2424 you got your twins then if any man shall say this is Jesus everybody with me this is this is Jesus speaking all right he's preaching on the seals then if any man shall say unto you Lo here is Christ or there believe it not now that sounds good oh Christ let's go he said believe it or not try it for there shall arise false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect behold I have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret chamber believe it not how are you going to not go for that how think about it where are wherefore if somebody comes up to you and says behold he's over there in that church he's fully over there in that church but now we drink a little bit and we just told church when we want to and we you know we cut let the women cut hair we let them preach every once in a while you know blah blah blah well you know one thing's for sure he's not over there go not forth behold he is in a secret chamber oh you can't touch him unless I tell you I know where that secret chamber is you got to come to me and listen to me I'll tell you where it's that believe it or not and I like what brother John's been doing the whole time he's going why cuz you don't have somebody doesn't have to tell you where Christ is if he's inside of you somebody don't have to come and tell you Christ is over here and over under if you got him inside of you cuz you say hey that's false he's right here right for as the lightning cometh out of the East and shineth even into the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be I want to ask you a question we talk about Thunders and everybody now is go but part of this verbiage of this message it talks about seven Thunders because it's in the Bible right but now do they just happen have you ever seen just Thunder or heard just Thunder no he's got to be lightning before the Thunder I think we're missing a lot of that cuz it says right here for as the lightning cometh out of the East and shineth even un the West listen if it's if it absolutely light if there's a lightning bolt there's going to be thunder man we had one at the house so the other day about knock me out of the bed you know you can now let's go to life lesson 473 if you see a lightning bolt count 1,1 10002 and every when that boom starts that's how many miles that is away from where it hit at Tony knew that I didn't have to tell him man Tony knew that long time ago but anyway I that thing knocked me out of bed and I went 1,1 it went boom I thought okay it was a mile away okay now let's get back to the service for as the lightning cometh out of the East and shineth but look listen to be honest with you why did why did g why did Jesus stand one day to identify the son of man and he put a lightning bolt in there got to be some Thunder afterwards we'll talk about that that's a little bit further down the road but we'll get into that a little bit later all right let's read the first seal real quick and then we'll close y'all are already went to ND and they said now here's a white horse now watch a white horse is the power now Jesus Jesus Remember keep this in the back of your mind Jesus preached the seals all right brother Brown didn't preach something new he didn't take it out of a new book he got it from the Bible all right and Jesus preached him in Matthew 24 supernaturally that nobody understood what he was talking about to put seal 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 is everybody with me until the prophet came and identified hey this is Seal one this is Seal two Jesus preached the seals all right he preached six seals and then guess guess who he is he's number seven he's the seventh seal we'll talk about that a little bit later in the sermons here's a white horse and a white horse is a power of charger now watch he's he's talking and said the man that sat on that was the White Horse was the Holy Spirit that went forth in the early age this is what he taught and conquered that age for the kingdom of of God he had a bow in his hand which meant like cupid he shot the arrows of love now brother Brown didn't even read the scripture because there's no arrow in that scripture okay it's just a bow he shot the arrow of love into the hearts of the people the love of God and he conquered now doesn't that sound good doesn't that sound good Christ comes and gets on a white horse and and he's got a bow and arrow and he shoots oh we just love we laugh but that's what was taught before the seals open that's the devil that he's talking about right now that sounds very good but it isn't the truth no sir it wasn't white does mean righteous we realize that that white means righteous the teachers taught it that it was the Holy Spirit conquering in the first age but my revelation of it by the holy spirit is not that way and the devil started getting nervous cuz he's fixing to do this amen where all them ages it was right there they were doing this right side by side my Revelation by the holy spirit is is Christ and the Holy Spirit is the self-same person only in a different form so here stands Christ the lamb we know was the lamb he's standing here with the books in his hand and there goes the white horse rider see so it wasn't the Holy Spirit what was he saying there's two people amen one here one here now that's one of the Mysteries of the last day how that Christ can be the three persons in one not three different people being three Gods as trinitarians say it's three manifestations of the same person or you might call it three offices if you're talking to ministers you wouldn't use office cuz just happened to think I'm on tape so I'll tell you of course Christ didn't say I pray my office and he'll send you another office we know that but if you want to make it it's three attributes of the same God and not three Gods three attributes of the same God and so how could Christ be out there with a white horse rider conquering and standing here with a book in his hand it isn't so here's where the devil got nervous he said it isn't Christ the air waves broke the logos began to speak amen amen the logos was beginning to tell us the truth right that's why the seals are so important it tells you so much truth it was locked up for all them years amen notice now the Holy Spirit and the Revelation in Christ the holy spirit is Christ in another form notice it is a lamb that opened the book and the lamb is Christ and Christ is not seen anymore from then Look Away to Jesus 1963 we're going to move away from that we're going to come back to that scripture but we're going to move away from it right now so now I'm going to say something to you now look let me tell you something else brother randam when he preached that he never ever took it back that's right because it was the truth it was God it was the logos speaking to us it was God speaking said hey that's been wrong for all these years even my preachers have been preaching this come on somebody Luther Wesley nobody thought that that was a white horse that well you know they say Clarence Lin did well that's okay but Clarence Lin wasn't a church a messenger either he was a listen a servant of God can catch the mind of God right amen but he can't put it together like brother Brown Put it together right so that doesn't bother me that Clarence Lin wrote that you know they say brother Brown was a copycat that he copied all this stuff that all this was already revealed and he just copied I no I don't think so so now I'm going to say something to you now that I haven't said all along and that's the thing that we have looked forward to for so long for at least many years four or five years is this other word that people get all as Bob says wonky about is the third pull but that is part of our B verbiage and is part of our message of the hour everybody with me wake up for a minute I know it's hot in here but that's okay has now the third pole has now been Vindicated and I'm sure you know what it is now they didn't now remember there'll never be an impersonation of that cuz it can't be see it can't be it's inexistent I'm warned of this that soon right at this time now I'm just H it just happened so it could identify its presence among you see but it will not be used in a great way now watch until the Council of churches now under the third pole there was what five things that happened right ain't that right s we had the squirrels um sister MAA all the different things the great part of that we'll get to that a little bit later but those were some great things but he said it's not used in a great way until the council begins to tighten up now the council hadn't tightened up yet it's beginning to tighten up and when it does when that does the Pentecostals and for so forth can almost impersonate anything can be done you watch you go out there and you watch I'm not going to call their name but some of the Evangelist and the ones that you know they put their hands on them and and there's testimonies of you know they get slain in the spirit and all that women doing the same thing let me warn you Jesus stood there one day he said there's going to be two Spirits he said one's going to be anti and one's going to be of me all right I'm speaking in the first person one's going to be of me he said Beware of false Christ so he's speaking the logos is telling us so the logos is going to have to tell us where he's at and what he's doing all right but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down then you'll see look what you've seen temporarily wow that whole time of brother brandham sermons and everything all the great power of of manifestation in his Services of thousands of people being healed was temporary when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you've seen temporarily be manifested in the fullness of its power see see see you see what we're doing we're just absolutely living below our privileges we absolutely have this part is coming and it's going to happen to somebody we can sleep our way through it if you want to that's fine with me but somebody's going to get it and move on somebody's going to make it's going to be happy that they got it maybe get some pom poms or something I don't know do you believe we're living in the last days when the son of man was to be manifested that would be all the word that's gathered up to Luther Wesley Baptist that's why we're going to have to go through the church ages and all that and the Pentecostal all gathered up to the revelation of what it's all been now watch the seventh angel was to open the six seal mystery now you say boy he missed it there I thought it was seven seal mystery I'm reading what he said what is the seventh seal Christ when he preached the six seals he introduced Christ to us the seventh angel was to open the Sixth Seal mystery it's all to be gathered up in the son of man his fullness of time has come to the fullness of his word now to manifest the fullness of his body look how many times he said fullness his fullness of time has come to the fullness of his word to manifest the fullness of his body that's the word then that's the spoken word made manifest by the word revealing the word former latter rign 1960 watch the ministry of the Holy Spirit watch it today when it comes back the church has gradually been coming down the First Reformation was Luther we had a great big wide place he's talking about the pyramid justification by faith the church was shook then come along Wesley the second Big Revival it shook it down into sanctification the church became in a minority greatly in the minority then after that come Pentecost the restoration of the gifts it shook it down now just a little thing like a pyramid coming up but right at the end time before the Capstone can come to the pyramid what about it what is it then the church is really in the minority as it was in the days of Noah so will it be in the coming of the son of man where eight Souls were saved by water now the coming of the son of man what is it the church comes from justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and now former and latter rain coming together coming in and it is close approaching as my hand is a shadow it becomes closer darker darker and it becomes a hand and a shadow is the same that's what we're looking at and listen it's a pull so you got to have it inside if you don't have it inside no pull there's no if there's no magnetism inside of you to magnetize to what's coming you're just going to be left out oh we need to get praying we need to be in prayer service y but there's two things you can do if you going to give out money or feed them they'll come I thought I'd just say that for a minute Revelations 1:8 says I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending sayith the Lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty now this is God identifying himself I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending which is which was and which is to come the Almighty I John who also was am your brother and companion in Tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ now remember John tyed the what bride was in the aisle of patmas for the word of God that's juli and Gary just came back from there and for the testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet now he heard a voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou seest wri in a book and sited unto the seven churches which are in Asia this is God talking to John unto Ephesus Smyrna pergamus thyra Sardis Philadelphia and Lea and I turned to see the voice that spoke to me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one liken to the son of man in other words someone standing there with flesh right clothed with a garment down to the feet and G about the paps appear Pap's breast with a golden girdle feminist brother Brown says we'll get it to it I just want to read this and this is where we're gonna get started next week his head and his hair were like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as flame of fire and his feet like a Define brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword in other words there was seven stars and there was seven messages or word that went out all right when a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in its strength and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I'm alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and of death in other words he's saying John I got it covered I got all the keys I've died now I've Resurrected write the things which thou Hast seen and the things which are and the things which shall be Hereafter The Mystery of the Seven Stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks the Seven Stars are the Angels of the seven churches and the Seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches let's stand our feet musicians come we'll start right there on the Book of Revelations uh we're not going to break it down like brother Dale did
