want to do we want to continue this thought and we'll we'll cut through some of the we've been in the old testament a lot but today we're going to draw it right into the new testament and we're going to uh to see how this baby got here this god child this god baby this baby that was god and this god that became a baby amen you ain't kidding thank you lord a toothless god wow created his own body

lord church over there the overcomers lord brother royal was lord is there searching for a new pastor lord please lord give them something special father give them something special that they i know there's no man can fill that man's shoes no man but lord you said that they were one would one would go and one would come and one would go and one would come so you you're the one that'll bring the next one in father you brought brother royale in i believe you'll bring another one in right behind him lord and i pray that you'll be with that group of people lord because the sheep are there lord they're looking to you lord i pray that you just bless each one in jesus name amen yeah it's been really on our heart they're trying to they're searching for a new pastor over there at the in the philippines from brother royal's church so just keep them in your prayers they got a big church in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not that was a man sent from god whose name was john the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light now remember john was to introduce the messiah all right john was to introduce god in human flesh no man had ever done that before he was the hinge point between the old testament and the new testament he was still in the old testament under the law because the new testament was after christ died and john died before he did all right but he was a prophet though he was that hinge between he stood between the old testament and the new testament to do as malachi said to turn the hearts of the children or to the fathers to the children all right so he's going to take those old testament fathers and turn them to the children of the new testament age right he he preached for six months no recording of any miracle the only thing he done was made people mad it was recorded and that's what got him killed because he started preaching marriage in divorce really yeah that's what he said they said he's he told herodia he told the uh whatever the guy's name was he said you can't marry her that's your brother's wife he's still alive well they just whacked his head off and shut him up they didn't shut him up though he did his job he did what he was supposed to do so there was a man sent from god whose name was john but now watch you take that parallel that was john of malachi 4 of the first part turn the hearts of the fathers to the children then somebody's supposed to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers another elijah a john the baptist that introduced the messiah at the end of the old testament is this familiar then we've got another elijah at the end of the new testament that's going to introduce christ amen that we've seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears because some of these you know you read the scriptures that we've seen with our eyes we've heard peter and all the different ones what a wonderful time i'm telling you if it doesn't really strike to your heart what god did for us in this end time and all the others can say the same thing when they were alive brother john but they're not alive now we're alive we're to carry this thing on to the coming of the lord amen there was a man sent from god whose name was john the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him that's me and you but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god not the son of charles and elle branham not the son of samuel peggy dale the son of god to be sons of god even to them that believe on his name and why do they try to take his name out well that's what satan wants to do he wants to try to take the name out because if you don't have a name you don't have a family i've never seen a family on earth that didn't have a name i would it wouldn't exist what's your name no there's a name behind everything every time there's a baby dropped on the earth there's a name behind it amen and there's a progeny or there's a generation behind all that which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory as the as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated in the lord as blessing to the reading of the word then this is where we're going to try to to get to part of it today let's read hebrews 10 verse 1. i preached on this some how long ago donnie 15 years ago or so my body that has prepared me and he keeps reminding me about it about every couple of months so must have must have stirred his stirred his uh soul i guess huh but that's what happened he prepared a body for for himself to dwell in and he's preparing a body now for himself to dwell in amen hebrews 10 verse 1. now watch we're going to come back and look at the old testament just for a minute but hebrews 10 verse 1 says look for the law now remember the law came with moses through the prophets even jesus came under the law amen jesus christ came under the law that he might get us out from under all that by being by being the savior to save us that's what savior means is to save us all right so now look what it says here look for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the thing you see that genesis 1 26 man was not the was not see we were made in his image okay but we were made we were created there was an image that god saw of me and you that couldn't come in the old testament none of that genesis 1 26 man could be brought forth through the womb of a woman by sex nobody got that that's your genesis 1 26 man not by sex not by blood what it says right here born not of blood nor the will of the flesh don't move it nor of the will of man but of god that's that genesis 1 26 man genesis 1 26-27 man never had a beginning never had an end never had a mama never had a daddy god that is a part of god that's god made manifest in another form called his body or called his bride everybody got that amen we've been through this 100 times you ought to know that about genesis 1 26 that's the bride of jesus christ and no one else that's not even moses that's not even daniel that's not even john the baptist the least in the kingdom is greater than john the least in the kingdom what is the kingdom genesis 1 26 that's the kingdom of god that's god made manifest in another form not a second person for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the thing so see whatever it was in the old testament you've heard brother brown talk about it you've heard many preachers talk about it it's types and shadows because see we don't have to come to church today and drag a a lamb or a turtle dove or a or a pigeon or or keep one up 14 days you understand what i'm saying but they did but that's all they could do because they couldn't develop that genesis 1 26 man there was no one to do it god had to come himself by isaiah 9 6 behold a virgin shall conceive so we had to wait until then to get here but there but that didn't negate the old testament say well the old testament's not even good no that's all your types and shadows everything they did was a type in the shadow and when jesus stood out and and stood from the baby to we'll get to it a little bit later when he stood that's who it was who all those symbols were talking about pots pans candlesticks remember the candlesticks not was in the second court well what happened in revelations one there was the son of man standing in the middle of seven golden candlesticks all those symbols were for one purpose and that's to show jesus christ but when he came and those old testament prophets the religious people of the world that knew the bible by cover to cover he came exactly the way they said he was supposed to come and they didn't believe who he was amen that's why i say all these people that believe brother brown's got to come back i don't see it myself it's not in the scripture nowhere but it's it's just the words of somebody talking but and that don't mean nothing to me but if he did come back if he didn't come back the way you wanted him to come back you'd be the same way you'd be the same way you wouldn't know who he was you wouldn't know he'd step and he'd step right there and say look jesus said i am he i'm the one and they called him bill's above the same thing with brother brown i mean do the same thing to him because you know what he didn't come the way they wanted him to come he didn't say the words you wanted him to say he didn't put up the tent in your yard whatever but anyway i'm looking for jesus christ to come back that's all i'm worried about jesus saved my soul jesus is going to raise me jesus is going to sanctify me jesus is going to take me in the resurrection i ain't worried about nobody else now we're not going to get there without the words of that prophet though you will never take a body change without the words of that prophet all right amen for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never look with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually they were doing sacrifices every day pretty much for this or that or the other they had all kind of offerings that you that were made but they continually made them but they had to continually make them continually make the comers there in two parts what the ones that came up to the altar burning fire brought a substitute flesh a lamb a natural lamb killed the lamb put it on the fire did whatever ritual they needed to do and i i say ritual it wasn't it was hey listen it forgave them of their sins but it became a ritual oh really whatever just the lamb is at this time of the year yeah go buy me one that's what happened in the temple remember they were selling lambs they were selling turtledoves they were selling this stuff so you didn't have to do it kind of like a drive-through service we have now we get all this convenience so they were just going to well just walk in pay 15 or 10 and here's your lamb we'll throw it on the altar for you well that's why it made jesus mad because there was no effort involved the effort was you put the lamb up the effort was you looked that lamb in the eye the effort was you knew that lamb was gonna die and you knew that lamb if it didn't die your sins were going to just keep heaping on you and heaping on you and heaping on you so it wasn't a ritual until later on but it became one because jesus told or god told them said it's become a stench in my nostrils but with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there and two perfect so therefore we understand that there was no new birth in the old testament because it would have made them perfect if they had been born again now there's people in the message that believe that i just can't see it because the bible says they can't be perfect not by sacrifice not by an animal sacrifice listen because we're going to read in just a minute as isaiah 53 we've got to pull jesus apart for a little while because he didn't give his body a ransom for your sin he gave his soul a ransom for your sin big difference because that was the soul of god the body was the body of jesus we know that was the body of god but they've got to go to go the funeral y'all y'all be safe brother joe's going with them but they'll be back man what about they were having a reunion and one of their people died so let's just pray for the family amen so for then who then for then would they not have ceased to be offered in other words if it would when jesus died there could there had to be no more you didn't have to offer anything he offered once for all and that was it but before that they had to offer every year there was an ignorance offering there was of this offering there was a list you know when jesus even when jesus was born they were so poor that they if you were so poor you couldn't bring a lamb you get two turtle doves or two pigeons and you take that and what would you do he would ring the neck off of one put the blood on the other listen i'm telling y'all when you look at all the sacrifices do you know that in solomon's when they dedicated that temple the bible says they could not number the sacrifices that were made now you're talking about a bloody mess i know some of your deer hunters and some of you slaughtered pigs and slaw could you imagine slaughtering one but could you imagine in one place slaughtering hundreds of thousands of animals but see that's what god required in the old testament he required that they did that but when he hung on that cross it only required one person because he had a soul that could come back into the believer he had a soul that he could impart eternal life to me and you and you didn't have to do that over and over again but that animal soul it just went away or the animal spirit it didn't have a soul but that animal part of him that just went away it didn't come back and made the guy better no he put the sacrifice on there if he was a liar he was still a liar it just covered his line for a year he just went back and lied some more amen but once we come to the supreme sacrifice if we were a liar we're not supposed to be a liar no more amen because that life can come inside me and clean me up amen just get back to some simple salvation but guess what we just might need it amen for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshiper once purged once pers what purging means if any of you ever uh eat crawfish there's a purging you have to put them in water and they purge because they have uh mud in their guts but that's the same thing with me and you you got mud in your guts you old crawfish amen because the worshiper once purged should have no more conscious of sins wow take that one home i think what he's saying is we're not supposed to have a conscience of sin if we're born again by the baptism of the holy ghost hello but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year year over and over again for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins that's why there's no new birth in the old testament or it would have took their sins away but they were under a brother brown said a substitutionary or a substitute blood or a capo or covering to keep god from killing them he could see he could see the blood and not see them you know that still happens right remember brother branham when he had the vision god you know god took him behind the door when he was condemning that old woman he said there's a there's a red rim of blood around the earth he said it keeps me and you from being killed because even being a human being if we were standing in front of a god in the way we're standing now we couldn't stand it now he couldn't judge our soul but he'd have this guy to have to deal with in my spirit realm see what we're moving to see what we're moving to we're moving higher we're moving to get this spirit man of us cleaned up amen for it it's not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body has there prepared me now that was a natural body because if the if the if the old testament sacrifices were natural they were all natural they were all flesh of animals bulls goats turtle doves pigeons whatever more you want to say that they sacrificed that was a natural flesh thing so so you've got to understand that if that couldn't take away sin there had to come something in flesh that could take away sin because in flesh is where we fell all right we've been over that over and over and over again but let's go back just for a second to the old testament just stay right there because if we don't go back we've got to go to the old testament because i'll read you a quote here in just a minute where brother brown said that the old testament saints the old testament prophets built the body of jesus christ that's hard to understand if you just throw it out there so maybe i'll try to help you understand it a little bit because look the word of god is a person everybody with me in the beginning was the word word was with god and the word was god and that word was the logos that came out of god the son of god that we talked about a couple weeks ago a person a man that said let there be and all this came into being amen is that right tell amen amen that's that's the way it is but now then you take that person that said that that person there was something happened between there and the promise of the genesis 1 26 man not inside that we know genesis 1 26 man was the spirit realm but when he put him in 2 7 they something happened right in there that this whatever this is right here the logos that speaks the word could not become fully expressed they'll be okay with that because being fully expressed he was coming down in human flesh and lived with his children and we were going to be let there be let there be james colley let there be um good grave king remember your name sister charlotte i'm getting old too we've known each other a long time haven't we but that's what god would would be was going to do let there be not let there be sacrifices and animals and this and that and the other he was going to bring his children and we were going to what we were going to converse with him and he was going to be our father and we were going to be as children and we were going to live on this earth in the garden of eden he said how the world you know that because that's what we're going to do that's what we're going to end up at amen but remember there's going to be a difference between that garden of eden and that garden of eden that one had a devil involved that one had a serpent it had a beast in it this one over here will not when we get into that future home there will not be a devil to have to worry about and truly if you're born again today like i said before your piece of your future home is right here because if you're born again today the devil's not inside of you either he doesn't reside now he sure likes to talk in there yeah amen he's talking to you now so the old testament saints are prophets each one of them what did they do son of man prophesy prophesy most of the time it was a prophecy of condemnation because israel had turned from god right god said do this do this do this and you'll be okay but if you don't do this i'm going to send you somebody that's going to talk to you very sternly jeremiah ezekiel all the different ones but inside all that what's god doing he's get he's preparing the people for the messiah he's preparing the people so that this man that's way up here there's jehovah god that nobody can touch that nobody can see he's going to express himself can't fully express himself through isaiah jeremiah and all those different ones because they're not part of that genesis 1 26 man they're not the bride of jesus christ they have a position but they're not bright everybody did everybody see that it's not belittling them listen they're very powerful people listen they can do more with the holy ghost while they were on earth and sometimes we can they did more with an anointing then sometimes we can do with the baptism of the holy ghost in our soul that's why brother brown says we're living way below our privileges our privileges are as if we can do that and more we can do that plus because remember every one of them had a flaw moses he was a murderer murderer he killed a man right david committed adultery killed his best friend look at all the different ones they all had a flaw but what they were doing was they were building a part of the body for god to step out on when he came into human flesh because when jesus came because isaiah had to say a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a child that's not possible i will read in a minute mary says how's that possible she was even at 16 years old she had a little bit she knew about how babies were coming right out of me not knowing a man can have a baby he said with god all things are possible well what was she doing she was she knew she was referring to isaiah where a virgin shall conceive but isaiah had to say that so that god could put a seed in a womb and bring forth a child and then when the baby was born to us a child is born a son is given there's another scripture we could spend days at thousands of scriptures that jesus that body was built coming down through the old testament and then finally here he was he stepped right out and listen to this let's read this quote then number one this is from the masterpiece and then come finally the great head the head of a head of all of it the rest of the body just spoke of it the foundation was laid by the patriarch but the body was built by the word which was the prophets so the prophets said what did they do a prophet catches the voice of catches the thought of god and then he's the mouthpiece that doesn't speak his own words because listen isaiah according to the bible isaiah was a young man even when he died he was very young so he wasn't an old guy and he steps out one day and he said behold a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a child and he turns around walks back in the house because remember they weren't required to explain what they said they were just required to say what god told them to say amen the body was built by the word they were the word of god for that day but the body was built by the word which was the prophets and here comes the head of all of it jesus came on the scene there when this headpiece was put upon it we find in him the entire handiwork of god each one of them was a piece a finger a toe an eye an ear a nose a mouth the different pieces to the body but he was the body he was the one that god put it together all right listen there when the headpiece was put upon it we find in him the entire handiwork of god we find in him the perfect reflection of the word for he was the word the fullness of the word see isaiah was not the fullness of the word jeremiah was not the fullness they had their part ezekiel had his part son of man prophesy but watch the fullness of the word now now again i didn't put that in red but i should have now again now whose brother brown he's preaching the masterpiece he's talking about jesus christ back there he's talking about the old prophets back there but he's got to make it current now again god has the perfect masterpiece again he's already talked about the prophets he's already talked about jesus christ who's he talking about now me and you me and you this is the way we got to come we got to come old testament jesus christ being our savior and now again god has the perfect masterpiece again because the headstone's back we'll talk about that later on maybe some of you don't understand that but we'll we've got to we've got to understand it because that's who he was there's your headstone right there jesus christ the perfection of god the totality of god the fullness of the word so let's go to isaiah 7 13. let's read that over again like we did this morning and he said here you know house of david is it a small thing for you to wear men but will you wear in my god also therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel which is by interpretation we know that is god with us all right isaiah 9 6 for unto us a child is born though this is what the child is going to step out on this is what god's going to step out on he's going to step out on that word unto us the son is given the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end sounds like a pretty important guy upon the throne of david upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this so there's isaiah we i'm going to pick we're going to go to isaiah 53 because to me isaiah 53 gives you the whole picture of god and what he's going to do so you need to wake up just for a few minutes so we can read this okay just wake up just for a few minutes okay because if you're not i'm gonna walk back there and scream at you okay this brother that's coming in a couple of weeks that's coming in uh at the uh when we eat in november the 14th he uh the data of the whole group is the one that's got on his phone when his phone rings it goes wake up that's what his ringtone is and it's me he downloaded it and put it on his phone so now is it when the phone rings it says wake up so anyway who has believed our report that's my question to you who has believed our report isaiah 53 is writing this he is reporting i'm reporting this who's going to believe it all right it's what he's saying who has to believe thy report and to whom is the arm or the strength or the might of the lord revealed how is the arm of the lord revealed through jesus christ but to get jesus christ when you watch listen when this man that we were talking about this right here back in the old testament he comes down and gets into human flesh what does he bring with him he brings that genesis 1 26 man with him folks that's the soul of god genesis 1 26 is not a different soul of god it is the soul of god it's the attribute that me and you are before the foundation of the world that's us right there and he brings that weather he don't leave it up there he brings it with him listen that's why you and i can understand this word of god more than anybody theologian whatever you want to say because we're part of it we helped write it i'll clap too we helped write this bible because we're part of god not a different substance so as that substance moved we moved brother brown said you didn't know anything about it though because you were born down here born in sam what it was blacked out what he said it was blacked out jesus knew where he came from because he's the one that brought it the guy that brought it ought to know where he came from all right so he knew before abraham was i am that's why john 17 he could say he could say father i prayed for them what them genesis 1 26 people i prayed for them people because i saw their journey before i even got here and i know they're going to have problems for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant as a baby behold the virgin shall conceive as a root out of dry ground he has no former commonness in other words he wasn't maybe he wasn't the prettiest baby like michael was he your prettiest baby benjamin was not here so he was your prettiest baby okay i figured he was so anyway he's still pretty good looking kid man grown grown adult amen but look he has no formal communists in other words he didn't come the way that caiaphas maybe caiaphas was born in a hospital with a gown and all the smelly good stuff but when he heard this man that says the messiah was born over a manure pile with swaddling clothes which was the which was the cloth they put over the the sweaty ox to keep him from getting sores and blisters that's what swaddling clothes is folks it's it's like the horse blanket so guess what it's closest to the horse and whatever's on that horse is on that blanket that's what they had to wrap jesus in because they didn't have he didn't have a a carter's or uh oshkosh begosh isn't that right joyce i bet ellie's not been wrapped in swaddling clothes ever but look this is the way he came this is the way god came that's why i was this morning or yesterday i was thinking about i said god this is the way you came you chose to come this way why even though he's the god of glory he don't want to be when he was down here on earth he didn't want to be up here he wanted to be down here with the lowest of people now we know he's the god of glory we know he deserves all praise we know it deserves all us to bow our knee to him but while he was down here he was a servant amen he become a king man he was a root out of dry ground wait a minute yeah no former coming us and we shall see him there's no beauty that we should desire him in other words if you see something beautiful what's the first thing you do it catches your attention you see a beautiful flower a beautiful picture a pretty car an old car that's been really fixed up real good that's beauty but he walked through a crowd and nobody know who he was amen he walked through a crowd and probably nobody knew who he was that's our god he is despised and rejected of men so guess what so are you a man of sorrow wow acquainted with grief we think we have problems have you ever just said and read this take it part by part and we hid our face from him he wasn't even somebody we wanted to look at he was despised and we in other words we didn't hold him up we stand when you esteem somebody you hold him up in honor we know while he was on earth nobody ever lifted him up all people they tried but they didn't care about this guy from galilee wasn't he from bethlehem wasn't he from nazareth does anything good come on nazareth even that's what philip or one of them said surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted when he was hanging on the cross they said kapha said he can't even save his self how in the world how is he going to save other people he just didn't know he was prophesying that he was not going to save his self that he was going to give his soul he was going to give his soul a ransom but they couldn't see the soul of god it was hid inside that flesh amen but he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquities didn't didn't didn't deserve it but he took it the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we get physical healing with his stripes on his body his flesh body all right but remember that's not what saves us it heals us that's not what saves us though it's that soul that's what saved us because we'll see right here all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way wow peter bless the lord i'll be right there with you the whole time i got you back and i figured peter was pretty burly guy i mean peter wasn't a little wimp now a little john he was running around naked everywhere so i don't know about john the revelator but well it is it's true he just run off naked and somebody pulled his clothes off of him he just took off through the bushes but there was peter though with his sword this ain't gonna happen to you lord i'll take care of that right now god touched him and he whacked the guy's ear off jesus said peter this thing ain't over yet you're fighting with flesh and blood i'm fixing to go give my life so that we can have a spiritual battle but you're gonna deny me three times before the sun comes up the next day because that's the crop the crowing that many times is the daylight coming all right all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way there was nobody there with him nobody even the ones that loved him and and you know even there was little john different ones that they just scattered the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all god almighty he was oppressed afflicted yet he never complained one time he never complained one time he has brought us a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before his shears is dumb so he opened not his mouth he didn't even make a case for himself when he come to the end when they were going to crucify him he never made a case for himself he could have made a case for himself he could have said i didn't do those things you said i was doing because remember pilate said are you not going to say anything see he just stood there and then they just looked at him he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off naturally remember i preached on that a long time ago who shall declare his generation because remember his natural genealogy was cut off that day at calvary that he was a man he could have had children he could have had a progeny he could have had a generation of jesus's naturally but that's not why he came he didn't come to make a natural lineage he didn't come to make a natural kingdom he came to make a spiritual kingdom all right the natural kingdom is what was killing people so he come to bring a spiritual kingdom but who shall declare his generation well that's if you receive the baptism of the holy ghost you're absolutely declaring his generation for he was cut off by the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul see it's been talking about his body the whole time he by his stripes were healed we we know that when jesus resurrected out of the grave that there was only nail prints in his hand and the thing in his side his body had been preserved but his soul was what you better look at a lot of men their wounds got better but there's no man could die and resurrect and come back inside you only god himself well thou shalt make his soul and offering for sin he shall see his seed or his what progeny his generation he shall prolong his days and the pleasures of the lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see of the truth now look here we go again he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities so what you get saved by you get saved by the pure unadulterated soul of god because remember they stood up to him one day and said said something and he said there's no man oh it's a good master and he said there's nobody good no one good but god you know why because he was living in a flesh body all right which was dying amen it was god but it was dying therefore will i divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath what poured out his soul unto death not in death his soul can't die your soul can't die but he poured out his soul brother brown said he played the part of death we'll get to that later about hanging on the cross that he didn't die his flesh died because the soul was removable isn't that what happens when you die when you humanly die your body dies and your soul goes somewhere else the only good thing about him though is is he resurrected and came back inside of you because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors and that's me and you if you don't know what transgression is that's me and you so with his flesh it was a sacrifice that the flesh had to die what did john say one day he said behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world he was identifying that that was the sacrifice and jesus he said well i need to be baptized of you and jesus said i know that but to fulfill the old testament showing he's still under the old testament to fulfill the old testament the sacrifice had to be washed before it was sacrificed the lamb had to be washed put up he said suffer it to be so to fulfill all righteousness he was fulfilling the old testament by being baptized he didn't need to be baptized jesus didn't need to be baptized he was because what did john say i need to be baptized you of you he said no he said i know that but to what but but look you're the high priest you're the high priest i'm the sacrifice you've already identified you said behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world so that lamb's got to die that's right that lamb had to die and there stood the high priest to wash the sacrifice and that's what john did he washed the sacrifice and then jesus went what the spirit of god came upon him and said this is my beloved son and whom i'm pleased to dwell same way with you at the baptism of the holy ghost god does the same thing amen so now let's go to luke 1 verse 26 real quick don't want to try to be too long we're going to have a little time of fellowship downstairs when we get done luke 1 verse 26 is in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god into a city of galilee named nazareth any good thing come out nazareth well there was a virgin down there that was one good thing come out in nazareth there was a virgin there and she was espoused to a man named joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou that are highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation in other words what's he doing here and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou has found favor with god and behold isaiah 7 isaiah 9 is fixing to be fulfilled and i like the way brother branham he set that up he said you know he said he said probably mary and joseph talking about getting married and they would be sitting out on the porch and they'd be sitting there and they'd be talking they'd be going they'd read maybe isaiah 9 isaiah 7 and then start in conversation and mary would go wow i wonder who that's going to be joel said i don't know said but he's got to come out of here and he's got to come out of bethlehem we'll read it in just a minute he's got to come from these different places and put everything everything's got to come together perfect nazareth they were sitting in nazareth she was a virgin okay so the stage is set but remember she is like the woman at the well no not exactly you understand but she is in the same situation she had read we know when the messiah comes well that's the same thing mary said that's why mary didn't really have a problem with it she was just wondering how it was going to happen because she didn't know a man but she knew that isaiah 9 and isaiah 7 said a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a child and said behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth the son and shall call his name jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david there's that other promise that's telling you about sitting on the throne of david in the millennium a promise that god give him and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then mary said of the angel how shall this be seeing i know not a man and the angel said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the high shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god amen overshadow thee so god created egg and sperm placed it in mary and i'll read it here in just a minute i think i got her i may wait till later on that she was just an incubator there was nothing connected that he she was not his mother we know that but god had to use her because he said in isaiah the way i'm going to get into the human race and purify it is this way isaiah 7 isaiah 9 i'm going to come by a virgin i'm not going to come by sex desire and this woman mary is not going to have any sensation about it or then it would be me and human race doing something that we really wasn't supposed to do and that's what brother ryan was talking about he said you see what you got god doing if you just give the sperm to mary and she produces the egg all right so god what the creator created his own self a body the full creation the whole thing egg and sperm fulfilling isaiah now let's go to luke 2 and 4. and joseph also went from galilee out of the city of nazareth under judea to the city of david which is called bethlehem because remember could anything good come out of nazareth he came out in nazareth but remember the bible i'm going to read it here in just a minute micah that he had to be born in bethlehem because the prophet micah said he was going to be see he had to be what the prophets built the body and told him where he's going to come from all right now see you say well by the way this is born that's you god puts you in this bible you've got to get yourself out of that bible and see where god put you and placed you he sacrificed himself so that you and i could have eternal life and be that genesis 1 26 man that was before the foundation of the world that can't sin never will sin never going to sin amen which is call bethlehem because he was the house and lineage of david to be taxed with mary his espoused wife remember he never touched her until after she was birthed the child being great with child so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son now oh hold it right there flesh has come into being flesh if she brought forth that means she birthed a son wrapped him in swaddling clothes like i said before swaddling clothes is like a horse blanket and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the end why they put them in a manger that's where lambs live they live in a barn they live in a manger and they were in the same country preachers abiding in the field keeping watch over the congregation some of you by night because you're asleep yeah brother dardy every time i say that he says help us at least he's awake enough to say that brother darty's been here and brother colley has been here as long as these walls have been here thank god for that you'll get your reward buddy i'll promise you that y'all been faithful and they were in the same kind that's what it was he kept white had to be shepherds read that read that or listen to that message it come to preachers the salutation the the first message came to the preachers and what the preachers do they took it and they watched over their flop by night look and lo the angel of the lord came upon them and the glory of the lord shone around about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them somebody else asleep and the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is born this day in the city of david a savior look who they are identifying who this little baby is which is christ the lord wow when you say those two words you've went all the way back into eternity because christ is the anointed one christ is the one that stood and said let there be and this will be a sign unto you you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was the angel with the angels a multitude of the heavenly host praising god and saying glory to god in the heist and on earth peace good will toward men and it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven the shepherds said one to another let's go check this out there was no bible for them to read except the old testament scrolls and they were shepherds they were preachers let us now go into bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass because that's what the angel told them where it was going to be at which the lord hath made known unto us and they came with haste and found mary and joseph and the babe lying in a manger okay let's go to micah 5 verse 2. says but thou bethlehem ephrata though thou be a little among the thousands of judah yet out of these shall he come forth unto me that is to be the ruler in israel whose goings forth have been from old from of old from everlasting now let's go to matthew 2 verse 1 i want you to understand something even herod herod was a tetri art or a ruler even herod watch now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judea in the days of herod the king behold there came wise men from the east to jerusalem do you know this is how this is how they know that jesus was not born at 1 bc or or 81 he was born in 4 bc because herod died sometime before it became a.d everybody got that even brother branham brings that out he was born in 4 bc the reason he was born in 4 bc is because herod was the the ruler and he died like a couple years later but but look you got to be careful because he's going to kill the babies that are two years old and back everybody got that this child that they're fixing to go see he's going to be a child not a baby that's right okay when the when the um three wise men come to visit him it's not a baby laying in a manger no it's a child it's a young child that's why he kills all the babies from two years down all right now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judea and the days of herod that came behold there came wise men from the east to jerusalem saying where is he born king of the jews for he we have seen his star in the east and come to worship him when herod the king had heard these things he was troubled in all jerusalem with him hmm it wasn't kept quiet but why didn't caiaphas and why didn't the ones that caiaphas had to be alive because he was probably in his 60s or 70s and jesus was in his 30s he had to be 20 or 30 years old what i'm saying is there's history behind all this there's history that they can say herod was troubled there was a a baby born supposedly be a virgin woman in in bethlehem where was he supposed to be born bethlehem thus it is written by the prophet verse 5. when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes in other words there's all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded them where christ should be born and they said unto him in bethlehem they knew where he's going to be born but he came a different way for thus it is written by the prophet micah and thou bethlehem in the land of judah are not the least among the princes of judah for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people israel then herod when he had probably called the wise men inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared so he got his astronomers out what time that star appeared well it appeared two years ago it took us two years to get here okay all right and he sent them to bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child not baby and when they found him when you have found him bring me word again that i may come and worship him well he wasn't he's going to kill him when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was and when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and when they were come see they were looking for something they saw the star that's the problem that people have with the cloud they just weren't looking for something i was looking for something i was for looking for christ to come back in a cloud they weren't looking for it so they don't they deny it same way with i bet you people denied this and said ain't nothing but three wives men knew what they were talking about amen you and i know what we're talking about we saw and believed everything that's told by to us by this prophet the problem was they didn't believe those old testament prophets they killed them jesus said you've you you wiped their tombs off but you're the one that put them in there wow when they had heard the king they departed lo the star which they saw in the east went before them until it came and stood over where the young child was and when they saw the star they rejoiced with its deed and great joy and when they were coming to the house they saw the young child with mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him and when they had opened their treasure what was it they presented unto him gifts gold frankincense and myrrh which thank god for a profit gold is deity frankincense dedication and murr is put on you when you die so it's deity dedicated unto death they told him exactly how he was gonna how he was gonna die told him exactly how that was gonna happen all right we're gonna read these two quotes and then we'll we're done all right everybody all right god's wrap gift listen to a prophet it ought to be a real attractive to the people little jehovah crying like a baby god made flesh in a package god who covers all space and time was before there was a world or a star or a molecule wrapped himself in a little package and was laid in a manger in a stable where the manures of the cattle and sheep and things up over that stable and this little manger on straw hay jehovah was laying there crying like a baby can you imagine it let's go to the next one super sign jehovah god became man took on our stock crossed himself from god and became man there's the sign he was god and became man not rich men but poor man this is the super sign you've asked for a sign said god i'll give you one an everlasting sign he could have come otherwise as i've said but a baby why did he become a baby when that first little toothless mouth opened in that manger on that first crib first christmas morning in his little manger crib and the first little yell went from it went from his voice that was god crying he had he had to start somewhere that was god crying jehovah crying a man came from god and was man ever wit man came to the world with nothing but still man what was he trying to do what was he purposing he cried like a baby in the manger he played like a boy on the street he worked with his daddy in the carpenter shop he taught like a man but yet he was emmanuel he came exactly the way the bible said he would yet he came a different way this is the super sign god dwelling in the creation that he created a body thou hast prepared me the super sign it shall be a sign unto you he was so poor that when he came to earth he came through a borrowed womb a borrowed womb of a woman and had to borrow a grave to be buried in god a virgin shall conceive without sexual interception jehovah borrowed the womb of mary a woman to perform the duty that he'd give an everlasting sign and was so poor on earth after 33 years and of half of ministry he had to borrow a grave to be buried in can you imagine talk about immaculate conception what meanest thou anyhow that god that said let there be that there was so many there are so many titles that you can't write them in a book he never had a beginning and he'll never have an end didn't hurt until he came to be a human he didn't cry until he became a human but he did it for me and you he didn't do it for himself listen he's god but he decided that was his plan he knew you and i were going to fall he knew we were going to need salvation and he was going to have to do it in flesh because he could not die as jehovah god he had to die as a human mortal man and he died for me and he died for you you see what now if you turn god down look what you're turning down every sinner that turned god turns god down has to crawl over and walk over the cross to get to hell because that's what stood between you and hell was the cross a man you a man make yourself god no it was god that had made himself a man he came a little bit different way what about me and you we need to come a little bit different way than what we've come before used to say in in in ball we'd say we need to up our game a little bit we need to all up our game a little bit be a little more sincere read another read a little more pray a little more study a little more because if god who did not have to do these things ever he decided that's what he was going to do and he gave his body a sacrifice but he gave his soul an offering for your sin because he can come back inside of you he can come back inside of you and make you just as perfect as he is no sacrifice in the old testament could do that and listen god didn't send a prophet in the end time to make that any different i believe he come to magnify what jesus christ did for us not to make it different but to make to magnify because what's the magnification of god it's going on up the statue of perfect man it's seeing that the headstone has come to me and you that the son of man ministry is here that you and i can live different listen don't try to be odd you'd be like jesus christ and you will be odd because you i'm i'm what i'm telling you when we when we start reading now the life of jesus as he gets older and goes up through this this stage of his life and matthew mark luke and john if that's the minister if that's the son of man and that's the way he acted and the results he got then if the son of man ministries here it's got to be the same they're going to hate you you're going to have to be this way in that way you they're not going to they're going to even your own friends even maybe your own message friends because of doctrine and because of a lot of things we've been cast out but you know what thank god if that's the pattern that brings the son of man back in the end time in a group of people then bring it on let's stand to our feet then bring it off that's the way it's got to be bring it on if god who didn't have to do these things he didn't have to be smitten he didn't have to be stricken he didn't have to get up on a cross he didn't have to sit there and let the romans spit on him and drag his clothes off and part his garment and all that stuff i mean come on then what's the little sacrifice that we need to do to serve god we're going to sing a song i think they got a a song that we're going to put on the board and uh yeah the brothers in the back can bring the song of the goodness of god and sister's always going to play for us so he's going to play for us sing along with with us it's a song that bella have been singing here recently but i'm going to sing it as a congregation hey man let's sing it to him if you
