========================================

good morning everybody to this morning's topic that I hate to talk about is a little topic I just built we're just kind of look at faith in action what so you know a lot of times we will get will come to church and we believe what the preachers say we do now I believe it and and and we hang on to our faith and yet we don't realize that you can actually do something with your face if you'll turn them loose it can accomplish a purpose I mean they can do something with it so I just kind of want to look at that we're supposed to have faith and then put it in action like on remand talk about the cell phones with their wings that were constantly moved and movement that you know wings over their face wings over there there was Emily we have the wings over their feet and the wings that they were in in motion where they were constantly an action movie so in the message puts their faith to work the message God's provided way of healing yes in 1954 program said now when you say you've got frame for divine healing and something strikes you it says to move out that's the confirmation that God has received your faith for divine do that's right when you got courage to put your faith in action but when you say you got faith and afraid to let it go your faith is dead see but when you got faith and willing to let it go then God's confirming it when the sign is following and you'll see your even so when you can let it go now a lot of times letting it go comes in different forms it's you know and you tell somebody if you're sick when you begin to tell some money I believe God's Word and you begin to confess I believe that God is still a healer he's still the same yesterday today and forever or the same thing with new birth I believe that God promised it I believe that God is able to give it to me then you releasing that faith right you're turning in loose don't pain your confection in a way that you act the way that you walk and you're taking taking a hold of God more than just letting it loose confession is is is lining up what you say with what God word says so if God works in your heel speaking fake I believe God word I believe that God said God god I've already paid the price for he paid the price on the cross and there's nothing else for me to do but believe it no no bro Graham said in faith in action and this is really I got to read this message and this is kind of where many wonders came from Burroughs said now faith is not based upon the shifting sands of man's ideas no that's something that kind of maybe maybe would just want to nail down for a second this morning because a lot of times we we can get so caught up in emotions and feelings and things and we look for for God to kind of speak to us in in like a feeling or a sensation or or like or or something that we use that to determine whether or not God has spoken to us or not but the real thing that brother Brandon said that we go back to that you know he says faith has to have a resting place and if we keep reading then he says the only solid resting place for faith is home God's Word so you got to have it but he's talking about you gotta have a prove something to rest your fainting right and that thing let us be honest the devil a lot of times he'll come in he can so easily impersonate sensations and Lysa stuff and that's really one of the dangers was with speaking in tongues and all those kind of things is that's one of the one of the easiest ways for the devil and just swoop in and and impersonate that traveler one thing you cannot impersonate is a revelation of God's work okay so if you go back and take it take it back to God's Word and see what God said about it but then you can rest on that and have something that you can put in action now you get the example if you were going to get married the woman that you'd marry you have to have faith in her she'd have to have faith in you because it can't be based upon something else and you know that's kind of a good example because a lot of times you could get kind of get in your head that the person that you're talking to or whatever is the right person or whatever but you got you got to have it based on something right in other words before before you got married you would want to have confidence in that other person you want to have confidence that they're gonna lead you closer to God and all those kind of things God's Word is a solid rock of eating faith that anybody wants to have in the supernatural that must be placed first in the Word of the Living God now that when men of old and in all ages when they would really find the Word of God they could grasp it faith went into action right away so let's kind of think about what faith is faith is like I just put this image of this locomotive plow through the snow we got all this snow nowheres all like circumstances and then locomotive they don't care about that snow it's just whoa because that's how crazy ISM and I looked at some of the things the way my brother very much explaining faith and he said any no circumstances hey it doesn't look at symptoms and and now now today we've got us a lot of symptoms and the whole work my hope my work has been just a madhouse of everybody going all about the coronavirus and everything and by the symptoms by looking at the things that are happening in China and India and all that comes to a little crew scared the snow might look scared and somebody trying to try to you know go somewhere but please so I don't care about the circumstances when the doctor says you got cancer or the doctor says you got some kind of horrible disease or somebody's a preacher might say well the Holy Ghost is not for you I believe you were born after 1977 or whatever faith says I don't care I'm ignore the circumstances I'm plowing to hear faith ignores what people say cuz you listen as you get older you'll find that that people will say all manner of kind of things faith if you're grounded and rooted in faith faith would they don't care if someone will say oh well if the promises not for you and then we'll put all kind of try to put all kinds of doubts yeah but baby ignores it faith is not a shame I'm going back to what people say you know after you get the new birth the year for your friends might be trying to ridicule you say well what you got is not the real thing or the devil kind of trying to be putting all kind of thoughts in your hand and stuff faith faith is like a big old bromley burly like Arnold Schwarzenegger that rises up just got that big old huge faith must right who cares woody by says the faith has no hinders faith knows where it stands and these are some things that really remember sent by faith faith says shut up and sit down another words when the devil comes along and tries to tell you all kinds of things Ranger says just just sit down ain't got no time for that nonsense faith is burly and runs and sees only victory and that's what faith is faith and and how you get faith you by reading the word by hearing the word by coming to church faith cometh by hearing because what is faith faith is a revelation of the word a revelation of the word will give you this kind of of an attitude towards circumstance and symptoms and all those kind of things when the when the end becomes I've been like a flood then the God will raise up a standard and what is this standard his word a revelation of his word and that is the thing that will defeat the enemy every time yes and the message is shame brother Ram said he said mister God God so look like when you pray for people you apologize mr. devil would you please move over and let me nothing phases got muscles and hair on his chest when it speaks everything else shuts up tell me where mr. devil do you move around get out of here I'm a son of God Commission of God leave him alone that moves you have no apology to the Dylan nothing to do with you I'm not ashamed of the Word of God not ashamed of your Commission not ashamed of who we are but as a servant I'm not ashamed I'm not ashamed of his work that's big old growing faith they could just take out a word and stand on and the message faith come about cometh by hearing brother I'm said now faith don't look at that faith comes around I don't care nothing about conditions God's its own and it's mine you see faith and birth as I once said faith that's here on the gist when it stands up and pulls it's big muscles out everything else vanishes away when faith really takes a whole nothing else stands now what I'm talking about it when you come to church to say I believe that's all good and everything but there's you can turn that faith loose and it will have an impact on your family it will have an impact on your relationship with God on things that maybe you think are impossible you got you got a powerful weapon down on the inside I'm just kind of a burden oi that fire on the inside and if you let that loose it can it can it can it will unleash the power of God yes turn it loose Jamie went to space don't take no for an answer it's got hairs on the chest it's big and burly it speaks and everything else sets down that's all you know you think about that genuine faith don't take no for an answer if you've got God's Word and you come to like for example the new birth the promise of the new birth the promises under you and to your children and right if you come to him and you might think what he's telling me no it doesn't seem like it's happening face does not take no for an answer you got your resting upon the Word of God thank you you know that's what faith really is is we you find something in the Bible and you're like I believe this or you sitting in church and you know that that's that's the truth and then you can come back to God and you lay it at his feet and say you promised it yeah I see you're obligated to keep your word see you said you said shut up faith will set in shut up don't you feel it that's it serious looking at what God said God said so so faith believe it and you can just hold on faith then just let faith take over it makes the rest of them look like little doors it just makes them sit down because he's the boss got great big groaning muscles and I tell you everything else all feelings and superstitions and little isms and things just sets down with faith takes over and what faith takes over you know you know that God is gonna come all the same you know that you've already got your healing even though it might not be manifest in your body and you know that the promise is gonna be given to you because your faith is resting on the Word of God yes both yes see I think maybe just kind of a magnet you got the sword of the word in your hand do you say well do you realize what you are in possession of what's in your hand why it's got writing you he said you're he's talking to somebody deserving in the congregation it's in your heart it's all over you the Holy Ghost do something about it throw it out there and trust God say certainly God promised it to me and I believe he says it and believe from the heart it takes your faith anchored yonder a dog saying God it is the truth there alone my stand and let that just keep in here until it drops down into here from your head to your heart till it becomes a reality then it'll work oh it can it work when it comes to the heart that's right no work it is good work if you just turn it loose it will accomplish his purpose and he said in the fundamental foundation for faith he said now when you throw ourselves completely to God into his and you lost through our own thoughts and just let the mind of Christ being us then same operations of the Spirit would work to us just as the natural things does just the same thing and he said God and His Word is inseparable you cannot have God without having his word and when you have his word you have God yes you should have his word and you believe is God that you believe it that then that is God manifesting himself in your life and when you throw yourself completely over to God and allow him to working by believing his word then if it will bring the same operation of the Spirit be working 3 yes that's why we believe that is 2nd Peter but Peter said according as his divine how he's telling about you get the new birth these time oh he's bringing he's laying out what faith is you start off with you your own faith you're believing and then God when he gives you the new birth to you guys his own faith that's right and I'm kind of laying this out because I don't want to impress upon you that you got something that you can do something with according as his divine power he gives us his divine power you you partakers of the divine nature and then he said beside this giving all diligence add to your faith so you've got the divine power and got the divine nature and that is faith so add to your faith virtue and so you start off with this base this face that that God has given you as his face Colossians 2:12 says buried with him in Baptism when y'all see you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God whoever raised him from the dead the galatians 2:20 says i am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God is his face is his faith let your living by so in other words it's like a locomotive that's sitting on the train tracks and down on the other side is this fire that's burning you got faith but the locomotive might be might be sitting there and it's got all of this potential to pull a great big old train load of cars but it's just sitting there on the tracks something's gotta happen to allow that thing to begin to move and what's got to happen is the engineer reaches over and opens that throttle up and it begins to move so you gotta turn loose that fate in your life well remember the said in faith in action he said if Moses would've took the favour of strong he'd have been known as another favor he'd be gone and in torment today but he's an immortal among men today because he chose rather and put his faith into action in other words he doesn't just sit it where and beside the burning bush but when God gave him faith when he when he was when he saw a revelation of God there at the burning bush he took his little staff and went down into impossibility and went down into an impossible looking situation and a Nord circumstances ignored all of the obstacles that were in his way and just said like right here how that is God said so and he was vindicated by an angel who come down and talked to him and told him that he was born for this purpose and Moses knew what he was talking about so he didn't stand by and baby around with it he put his faith into action yes that's what it takes no matter how much faith you got if if you won't use it it's no good to you if you won't use it it's no good and that's how you know a lot of people that may be sitting around and I believe I believe it but yeah you our families in all this already and I you know you do all sorts of predicaments and things that are the Salus and it's brilliant because that we won't open that throttle and turn it loose yeah what good is a god of Moses the famous things of the day what good is a story God you people who go to church and you church only teaches that some historical fact about the Holy Ghost coming back on the day of Pentecost there's no such a thing today that was healing back there well here does that beauty but look Jesus Christ lives he died he rose again according to the scriptures is alive forevermore and no works right he's still here and able to bring his work pass it will just turn loose and believe it and turn turn your faith loose and he said now this is I really want this this this is one thing that I just kind of love to get on is that you don't have to produce it not you know no um that's kind of let's kind of meditate on this person unnatural in a natural situation of a man and woman in the marriage the woman might have a job or whatever and she brings home some money or whatever but spiritually spiritually now the man and the woman are in a different kind of relationship the bride and the bridegroom as our relationship with God that the bride does not have to produce healing it is the bridegroom that doesn't all you have to do is believe that's all all Eve had to do to bring forth the child was just believe and word and when he's spoken let there be all you got to do is just believe and she would have had a child but she she she didn't go home with God's Word so you don't have to wait we think well I got a I got a manufactured something that takes the burden off of us all we got to do is believe it it's not up to us to produce the healing it's not up to us to produce the salvation it's not up to us to define our battle we're not the one fighting the battle right and all of those Old Testament stories today all David did was is throw stone how could David with a little stone defeat a big old Goliath with a spear and all those kind of things how could get in fight that battle how could a Daniel defeat the Lions Eric's never never the bride that in relationship to God that's actually doing the thing other than just believing how could the around it around Jericho how could they make the walls tumble down it's not the people doing anything other than just confessing God's Word you're not the one that has to produce it maybe you don't believe that you say well my faith is weak I waiting to deface it so you don't let the devil know that always say I've got faith I believe God with all my heart don't justify nothing of the devil he said take him at his word then it's all over on God then and not on you when you take it on the tape to take him at his word it puts everything on God it's not you you're not obligated to bring God's Word to pass he is the one that is obligated to bring his word to pass that's good as long as you take when you accept him as your healer don't never act like you're sick or crippled anymore believe that's revealed that's right as long as you take God at His Word in the world will produce what it promised it to do is that right now I have faith believe in with all your heart this won't ask you this upon these basis do you believe this to be the Word of God it cannot live in if it's God's Word it has to be true then if it's God's Word and it is true then he's obligated to every word that he's spoken here he's obligated to keep that word you see what that does it puts it all back on the man in the relationship sir my man is the one Jesus is the one that is obligated to produce his word because you know a lot of times we feel like if we're not getting healed quickly or not then people gonna look at us well but see that that takes the burden of proof off of you you're not the one that's obligated all you gotta do is believe and so if it doesn't looks like you're not getting healed or you're not being all answered in the cell or you're not you're not getting what you come maybe your kids are not coming back to the Lord fast enough or whatever this is although meal oh he said oh if we could only get that settled in our hearts how can i cancer be cured when the doctors give up yeah it's not this how can it be cured when the doctors say there is no way it's not me to try to figure it out it's take the word of the Holy Spirit he was the one who made the promise he's the one who confirmed that promise he's obligated to keep that promise okay that puts it all back on him it it ain't up to the doctor to try to find a way to give you what you need it ain't up to you figure it out it's all you so you don't have to produce it which means if you need any of these things that I've listed out then it's time to just open up that throttle and and believe God's Word trust him to bring his to pass and watch it watch it happen in your life because it's Bob there's all these promises in the Bible all the benefits is that psalm of David said for getting on his benefits the all these benefits that we have access to if we'll just believe and so if you need protection from disease oh my goodness the coronavirus coming around yeah if you need healing for your body if you need the new birth or if you need salvation for your children or if you need a job oh you know I don't I don't know what direction my life is supposed to have or I I don't know I needed I'm going through when we started getting the testimony territory I remember when when Esther was was when my wife was in labor with extra I had been laid off from a job month before that and I had no job when she was born and that was when the economy crashed and I didn't know it everywhere you go it nobody was hiring that's when you you got to put your faith to to work you you look into the Word of God and there's promises there right and you got to it you know it's fine to come to work and say I believe but there comes a point when you got to open up that throttle at the steam go to work and I believe oh you know program said Virts you is a pass for it to pass through it's just like that locomotive where there's a fire on the inside but some what to do how how to raise your family how to do things let that faith go to work you know but in Luke chapter 8 jesus said now the parable is this the seed is the word of God in other word if you plant a seed there's a law of God that a seed planted is going to come up and produce something so if the seed of God this the work that seed is the word the word God is planted in your heart and it's planning the ground it is going to produce something amen it's going to produce the word it's gonna come up that's right the same program sitting in the Church of the Living God I know we've got five movements the Word of God is the seed that produced the gospel and every divine promise of God in the Bible would produce if it's met in the right kind of a heart it'll produce the promise if you have need of salvation believe that he saved you and accept his sacrificial death and you shall receive what you've asked for if you're weary and gloomy and feel like that everyone's against you come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden I'll give you rest that's a scene accept it and if you're sick he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes were healed accept it it's a seed will produce that will produce amen no no I get just put on all these examples of people that despite struck them stances despite all equals of life they just put their faith into action I did not care what king said he's gonna bring that that offering and and cut his throat and let the blood run down despite all the laughing and everything that came to Noah did not care about all the laughing is he build that Ark for a hundred years as you worked and labored and people scoffed at him then finally he went into the ark and was safe Abraham did not care about all the laughing and odd looks and people from even his own family and and a lot and all the different things I have Moses didn't care about Pharaoh's saying what in the world are you doing it come in here with a staff and all the people in laughing and a faith is a big and brownie and and just goes in and takes over and takes charge amen David didn't care about all the all the Israelites standing there laughing the holy his own brother who do you what are you coming in here I know that you're just about the first for some nonsense but you go back and read that story of him until I thought all the Israelites well what are you doing here you just want to see what's going on you're just here to cause trouble he didn't care he's like he looked at Goliath and said is there not anybody here worthy to go fight against this guy and that's what real faith does you gotta turn it loose just because all those is realized they were Israelites but they were just standing there watching brother David turned his faith loose and did something baby brother and said there was a time when the toxin there wasn't meaning and many people died from their diseases but now you can be inoculated God one day made a toxin he's talking about it like when you go the doctor you get shot up to prevent diseases and everything and he says in the hour of his death the inoculation he'll strike he says what is a cancer what is the disease because I'm talking about it did you know the Bible predicts that in the last days though there'll be a germ warfare that diseases will break out from the colon will fall on everyone without the badness of the Holy Ghost my arms are so worn out from where the doctors has punched needles in to try to inoculate me from yellow fever and so forth I told about anything but they wouldn't listen to me but I've taken what God's going to do God got a serum goes in okis he said well as the plague Falls we'll just go down many of these time I the children of Israel down in Egypt will just go down beneath the ground and Acadie but shut the door down and I won't do it one good it will stay in the house and put a mask over our faces some disinfect on it but God problems were made a provided way and it was what the blood God divided it as simple as it seemed they take the blood of lamb and sprinkle the door yet God said that was his way and he honored him that's it brother Graham said it and questions an entry he said I'm God is love perfect love but you don't know what love is that's why people today don't know what faith in God is love it has to be in love he's sovereign to his more and he has to keep his word he has to love you than if he loves you that you will stop running
