[12:43] showing them that your grace is truly
[12:47] sufficient to have come down to mankind
[12:49] to can that we can talk about a savior
[12:53] and the Lord who the world is passing by
[12:57] and not seeing in the right way they're
[12:59] doing their thing Lord and that's all
[13:01] right but we just do hours to try to
[13:03] worship you and have a good time and you
[13:06] forgive our sins lead us Lord in your
[13:09] grace and love in Jesus name Jonah - and
[13:19] but I will sacrifice unto thee with the
[13:22] voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that
[13:24] that that I have vowed salvation is of
[13:28] the Lord now remember what it means
[13:30] salvation means deliverance all right
[13:34] you're captive you're delivered whatever
[13:37] it is see then we'll get into Lord
[13:39] willing Wednesday picking up into the
[13:43] basis of starting the new warden new
[13:47] testament at least but it said now verse
[13:50] 10 says and the Lord spake unto the fish
[13:52] and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry
[13:55] land okay now we read this the other day
[13:59] but I want to read it again and try to
[14:02] pick up the thoughts from Genesis 15 and
[14:07] we'll start with about verse 7 - just
[14:10] cut it down mean and he said unto him I
[14:13] am the Lord that brought thee out of ur
[14:16] of the Chaldees to give thee this land
[14:18] to inherit it remember we're in the Old
[14:21] Testament we're dealing with natural
[14:23] things
[14:24] it starts with dealing with land and
[14:28] things inheritance land you know giving
[14:32] you those things the Covenant then it'll
[14:35] move into
[14:37] thy seed and the seed then we'll get
[14:40] into the New Testament as it brings into
[14:42] the salvation of the soul but remember
[14:46] back Darnell their salvation was to
[14:49] follow what God gave for them and they
[14:53] had a salvation and that a place to go
[14:55] to if they died they went to paradise
[14:57] you know the Boozman with Abraham so
[14:59] don't forget those things and I keep
[15:01] saying it cause on the internet system
[15:03] somebody come along and say well this
[15:05] that or the other so at least they can
[15:07] pick up the thought alright what's
[15:10] what's now as he says and he said Lord
[15:14] God whereby shall I know that I shall
[15:16] inherit it land right he said unto him
[15:20] take me a heifer three years old and she
[15:23] go to three years old and around when
[15:25] three years old and a Turtledove and a
[15:26] young pigeon and he took unto him all
[15:29] these and divided them in the midst and
[15:32] he laid each piece one against the other
[15:34] but the birds divided he not and when
[15:37] the fowls came down upon the carcasses
[15:40] Abram drove them away and when the Sun
[15:44] was going down a deep sleep fell upon
[15:46] Abram and lo and horror of great
[15:49] darkness fell upon him and he said unto
[15:52] Abram know of a surety that I seed shall
[15:56] be a stranger in a land that is not
[15:58] theirs and shall serve them and they
[16:01] shall afflict them for hundred years and
[16:04] see you go over into Exodus when that
[16:07] picks up and you'll find it it'll say
[16:10] there say God remembered his covenant he
[16:12] made with Abraham you know the in other
[16:15] words telling exactly he said to be
[16:18] there for a year he remember there are
[16:20] four hundred and thirty years because
[16:21] they rejected just going out at that
[16:26] time so that calls from 30 years all
[16:28] right but still God's right is 400 years
[16:31] okay
[16:32] he said they'll serve the image will
[16:35] afflict in 400 years and also that
[16:38] nation whom they shall serve will I
[16:39] judge and afterwards he'll they come out
[16:43] with a great substance and I shalt go to
[16:46] thy fathers in peace that shall be
[16:49] buried
[16:50] in a good old age but in the fourth
[16:53] generation they shall come here there
[16:55] again for the iniquity Haman rights is
[16:58] not yet full and it came to pass that
[17:00] when the Sun went down and it was dark
[17:02] behold a smoking furnace and a burning
[17:05] lamp that passed between those pieces
[17:07] and in the same day the Lord made a
[17:10] covenant with Abram saying unto thy seed
[17:14] have I given this land from the river of
[17:18] Egypt and the great river the river
[17:21] Euphrates now watch what he said and in
[17:25] the same day the Lord made a covenant
[17:27] with Abram saying unto thee unto thy
[17:31] seed follow that as we get to it in a
[17:36] minute see he's not just dealing with
[17:38] Abram he's movin over and out - but he's
[17:41] not moving over the seeds right so we'll
[17:46] have to hold that point when we get to
[17:48] it in a minute father we thank you for
[17:50] this day in your grace we committed all
[17:52] to even Jesus name you may be seated now
[17:57] remember I thought remember what we've
[18:04] been dealing with remember how that
[18:07] we're talking about the fact that God
[18:12] made three covenants okay his first
[18:17] Covenant he made with Adam and he told
[18:22] Adam said now don't you eat of that tree
[18:25] of knowledge and everything will
[18:28] continue as it is they'll carry right
[18:32] along see that was this covenant to give
[18:35] a covenant always remember carry
[18:38] something with it
[18:39] - you know I'll give you the land well
[18:42] you know what you get the land alright
[18:44] so then he told him he said now
[18:47] everything will run all right said you
[18:50] just stay away from that tree all right
[18:54] now remember God saved Adam by grace
[19:03] he's not lost remember how we brought
[19:07] that out we brought the the grace coming
[19:10] before the sin you know God before the
[19:15] foundation of the world right all of
[19:19] that coming down remember the whole
[19:21] message we put into that point just to
[19:23] get your thought and then make anywhere
[19:25] you'll remember what I've been trying to
[19:27] say the atom was saved by grace okay
[19:34] God supplied an atonement alright
[19:39] then he jumps on over if you want to
[19:41] make sure of the atonement you'll find
[19:43] it will enter relate it in a minute with
[19:45] Abraham he jumps over to genesis 3:15
[19:48] promises christ to come and show and
[19:52] then that truly adam was saved not lost
[19:57] but he didn't stay with what god told
[20:00] him so then it was a conditional
[20:03] covenant he had a conditional cut if you
[20:08] do this if you stay here everything's
[20:10] alright if you don't it's going wrong
[20:13] well he didn't stay and it went wrong
[20:15] all right the next covenant was made
[20:17] with Noah and he told Noah he said
[20:21] there's a salvation laying here he said
[20:24] I'm gonna destroy the world but he said
[20:27] now I'm just not gonna wipe I'm not
[20:29] gonna lie elated I'm gonna wash it off
[20:32] but he said now you build an ark and you
[20:37] get in that Ark and that'll be your
[20:39] salvation the grace provided an ark for
[20:45] the saving of the days of Noah I don't
[20:48] want you to get too far in thinking a
[20:51] lot of times see because I know how my
[20:53] mind runs and I failed to keep relating
[20:56] you think I keep repeating oneself I'm
[20:58] not repeating I'm trying to get you to
[21:02] think to keep your mind in the right
[21:05] channel see then Noah was saved by grace
[21:09] because any covenant everyone so ever
[21:12] anything has to be grace so when we talk
[21:16] a minute about
[21:17] in about Abraham and an unconditional
[21:21] covenant see then your mind will follow
[21:24] what about Adam
[21:26] well what about Noah alright so now
[21:29] we're covering that they were saved by
[21:32] grace through faith of believing what
[21:35] God gave them in Abram is same as Adam
[21:40] and Noah he could look to genesis 3:15
[21:43] and see the promise of the coming of
[21:47] Christ the seed of the woman not seeds
[21:52] the singular seed of the woman to be
[21:56] able to bring forth their you know to
[22:00] deliver them alright cuz it'll all time
[22:03] when we get to Christ at all time you'll
[22:05] see he paid once for all for what was
[22:08] back there as well as over this way all
[22:10] right now so follow that order so then
[22:14] we see Abraham comes down he comes he
[22:19] starts Abram goes a long ways in his
[22:21] journey as the word Abram you know then
[22:24] we found that he started going through
[22:26] things because God had given him an
[22:30] unconditional covenant all right
[22:33] as I said it took a prophet to learn
[22:35] these things because the scripture we
[22:38] read we would just think Abraham went to
[22:41] sleep or Abram went to sleep
[22:43] no Abram was taken out of the way to
[22:47] showing what kind of what it would be
[22:48] that it would be an unconditional
[22:51] covenant all right now to start that off
[22:54] with I want you to think about what is
[22:57] unconditional name he said well it means
[23:00] no conditions that's that's fine that's
[23:03] that's good it means no conditions all
[23:05] right but you know what Webster says it
[23:08] means he said it means that it's not
[23:11] limited follow that later on is not
[23:17] limited it's an absolute now an
[23:23] unconditional covenant now when you talk
[23:26] about it now listen we'll get to back in
[23:28] just in a minute now what do you think
[23:30] about
[23:31] I wouldn't be listed unconditional
[23:32] covenant a covenant is a wonderful thing
[23:37] but do you realize that God to Abram
[23:44] gave him a covenant you know what he
[23:47] done then he doubled that covenant by
[23:51] swearing now we will read it in the
[23:55] scripture God swore that's all right for
[24:00] God to tell you something right but how
[24:02] much more sure can you believe anything
[24:04] when he swears you know I mean we're
[24:08] supposed to take our words you know and
[24:10] do and and everything but what about
[24:12] when somebody Swire's according to that
[24:15] well we can still file up ourselves but
[24:18] God cannot change his mind even though
[24:21] he justs made a covenant or made a
[24:23] thought but then he comes in swears by
[24:26] it what about that to go with it that's
[24:29] wonderful isn't it
[24:30] you know that the word unconditional
[24:34] actually means unqualified see when
[24:47] you're unqualified you don't have to
[24:48] qualify again that's the best way to say
[24:51] you know unqualified we think about his
[24:55] meaning that it's not worthy well that's
[24:57] right Abraham wasn't worthy
[24:59] nobody was worthy but now remember I
[25:02] thought reading to put that in there
[25:04] Adam was saved by grace
[25:07] he had a covenant but he broke the
[25:11] Covenant he didn't stay with it he went
[25:13] to that tree all right Noah had a
[25:18] covenant he built the ark he comes
[25:21] through in the ark but he turned over
[25:23] and went back to the tree of knowledge
[25:24] and died a drunk all right because
[25:28] that's the way that things are done but
[25:31] then when it's given to that just
[25:33] remember one time Noah and Adam wouldn't
[25:37] lost those grace had already provided
[25:43] all right now if that be true I asked
[25:47] you that question that Noah and Abraham
[25:52] and Adam will say by grace then how much
[25:58] more sure with the covenant be with
[26:01] Abraham and you know it's gonna be a
[26:05] grace covenant because grace comes
[26:07] before the law right remember the law
[26:09] comes wailing over in Exodus 19 all
[26:14] right so then just keep in mind that no
[26:17] matter how far you can go back grace
[26:20] goes back further than that to cover it
[26:24] all right now but to get us out if I
[26:28] don't get nothing else we'll get this
[26:29] talk why would God give Abraham an
[26:40] unconditional covenant we see and we
[26:47] know that man can't keep a covenant
[26:53] true your man can't keep a cone and Adam
[26:57] didn't do it nor didn't do it they
[26:58] couldn't keep the Covenant right but why
[27:02] would he give Abraham an unconditional
[27:07] covenant he puts him to sleep as we read
[27:10] there which means really the Prophet
[27:13] said he took him totally out of the
[27:15] picture to show him that he had nothing
[27:18] to do with it it wouldn't be anything
[27:20] there wouldn't be any point door of do's
[27:23] and dont's all right
[27:26] there's not a do's and don'ts in Abraham
[27:30] watch the point now hold it real tight
[27:32] because you'll find it in Abraham he
[27:36] says I'll give you this land he said
[27:43] I'll give you this seed I'll give you
[27:49] all of these things under no condition
[27:54] now there's where we fail now I'm not
[27:59] throw stones at nobody no problems of
[28:02] picking on churches I'm preaching here
[28:04] oh you go to a Baptist Church and
[28:09] they'll teach you a doctrine of basics
[28:12] called once saved always saved
[28:16] what now does that mean it now I didn't
[28:23] believe it back then see this back when
[28:25] I was there and then I spent 50
[28:27] something years ago I didn't believe
[28:30] then that you could live like the devil
[28:32] and be a Christian I always thought the
[28:37] way you live prove what she was I mean
[28:41] that's that's just the basis of it if
[28:44] you live like the devil then you the
[28:45] devil but see I've heard it preached and
[28:50] you've heard people talk about it well I
[28:53] know that person was saved like I said
[28:56] that guy that killed all them children
[28:58] and everything if he was a good Baptist
[29:01] and standing in good with the badness
[29:04] they might have been embarrassed about
[29:05] it
[29:06] but when they preach that God funeral
[29:08] they would put him in heaven you said oh
[29:15] no they wouldn't
[29:16] well then they'd have to deny their own
[29:18] doctrines but what does it mean to have
[29:22] an unconditional covenant well it means
[29:27] there's no conditions in it then you can
[29:33] live like the devil and get by with it
[29:39] no yeah but you just don't understand I
[29:44] know I don't understand our way of
[29:46] thinking god I never thought that to
[29:49] start with brother Branham didn't have
[29:51] to straighten that out with me
[29:53] on the basis that I could live like the
[29:55] devil and still die and go to heaven I
[29:58] went through too much of that I know
[30:01] that brother didn't live too good but he
[30:03] paved the parking lot and he believed he
[30:09] confessed he might have been a pervert
[30:13] but he's in heaven now come on Church
[30:20] you remember where you've been and the
[30:23] places you walked
[30:24] I may have emphasized it a little heavy
[30:28] but it is to make you think about it but
[30:32] what does it mean an unconditional
[30:35] covenant well God saw that Adam couldn't
[30:42] do it and he saw Noah couldn't do it so
[30:44] he just come on the scene with Abraham
[30:47] and just you solved the problem and just
[30:50] said go live like he won't - it's gonna
[30:54] be unconditional and show me that in the
[30:56] Bible or this prophets message show me
[31:01] any were mister prophet had ever taught
[31:05] you could live like the devil and still
[31:07] be alright
[31:13] and show me any pointer any thought you
[31:17] could even try to think about something
[31:18] like that we see here is what we are you
[31:22] have a brother Dale we all have problems
[31:25] we all have troubles you know well none
[31:29] of us are perfect this was a good one
[31:33] they used to say and be on a bumper
[31:35] sticker I'm not perfect but I'm saved I
[31:44] thought if you saved the saving is what
[31:47] made you perfect and I don't sound good
[31:52] does it when we analyze what people are
[31:55] saying about it they're saying I'm not
[31:59] perfect in you out and you know how do
[32:01] you think you perfect you know what I
[32:04] begin to the basses are playing to
[32:06] people to say that to me the Bible says
[32:08] that I am the Bible says because I'm a
[32:12] born-again Christian I'm perfect and the
[32:15] Prophet said I'm just as perfect as God
[32:17] is by being in Jesus Christ is that brag
[32:23] in our do it well then brother daily
[32:29] don't make no deals what you're doing
[32:30] you're going to heaven anyway you've got
[32:36] a lopsided view of Christianity because
[32:41] I thought Christianity was to deliver us
[32:44] from our problems I didn't know that it
[32:50] okayed the problems what do you think
[32:54] you're perfect you live a perfect life
[32:55] nobody in Jesus Christ he made me
[32:58] perfect because that's my atonement I am
[33:02] a human being with the mistakes that's
[33:05] why the Bible says then to the
[33:08] born-again Christians that you're going
[33:11] to give an account of the deeds done in
[33:13] the body whether good or bad
[33:19] now show me anybody in the Bible that
[33:25] ever went on the basis of they don't
[33:30] matter what I do see when you start
[33:36] talking about it don't matter what you
[33:38] do then there's something else talking
[33:42] there besides Christianity something
[33:51] else is in boiling in your thoughts this
[33:56] is the way I believe it and this is the
[33:58] way I appreciate always have on one time
[33:59] you realize becoming a Christian brings
[34:06] more conditions upon me as a human being
[34:10] than it would be if I lived in the Old
[34:12] Testament because if I lived in the Old
[34:15] Testament I could probably qualify
[34:17] pretty good you know I mean I could be
[34:21] like a rich young ruler I could say all
[34:23] of these I've done from my youth see
[34:31] that didn't save the man what are you
[34:39] understanding listen to the point what
[34:44] does it mean unconditional you said this
[34:50] means no conditions to it is that all
[34:55] you can believe is that all you can do
[34:58] then nobody's going to hell they're
[35:03] gonna have to do away with hell that's
[35:04] you know comes nobody ain't going have
[35:09] you been to a funeral lately as a priest
[35:11] it's a person going to hell nobody's
[35:19] going there anymore
[35:21] it's done away with my because well you
[35:26] can't condemn me for being wrong cuz
[35:28] you're wrong too but you see when you
[35:33] start using excuses
[35:36] you admitting you do not know what
[35:38] you're talking about
[35:42] well it really don't matter what I do
[35:44] because I am born again if you're born
[35:48] again I talk now that maybe the Prophet
[35:50] was wrong when he said maybe he was
[35:55] wrong
[35:56] maybe the Bible was wrong when it said
[35:59] you know the things I do I would not the
[36:05] things I would not this I don't do Paul
[36:07] was bringing you know what I mean and he
[36:11] said then it's not me that's doing those
[36:13] things as soul and being but he said in
[36:17] my flesh there's nothing no good sure
[36:21] we're human beings in flesh we do wrong
[36:24] right we better believe in an
[36:27] unconditional covenant but we better
[36:29] believe in it right and not believe that
[36:33] it gives you a right to live like the
[36:35] devil and you're still going to heaven
[36:38] you ought to be more concerned today
[36:41] about your salvation than you ever have
[36:43] in your life if this message doesn't
[36:48] bring into view a greater understanding
[36:52] of salvation and things and what it
[36:55] really is you know and the truth of it
[37:00] well you've missed the message could you
[37:06] never hear the Prophet said it's okay if
[37:07] you do that we all understand because we
[37:11] all have problems
[37:12] you never heard him say that you never
[37:15] heard the Bible say that but you hear
[37:20] the Bible speaking of it you hear the
[37:22] prophet speaking that the way I live the
[37:27] way I live is displaying what I am right
[37:38] then where would he give you a right to
[37:40] go out and do anything wrong
[37:43] why would it not be then we ain't even
[37:47] got to Christianity yet I'm dumb that
[37:49] new Tesla we're still an Old Testament
[37:51] why would David come forth from the bed
[37:54] of Bathsheba Ron cuz reach about well
[37:58] that's where he's coming from and he
[38:00] said the Lord restore unto me the joy of
[38:03] thy salvation and why would God say I
[38:14] gave you these offerings to make and
[38:18] told you how they were doing what they
[38:20] would do but said my nostrils that
[38:22] follow your offerings and sacrifices but
[38:28] said I would turn understand a contrite
[38:30] heart that's what David had why didn't
[38:35] they kill David for taking Bathsheba
[38:38] well who's a king no don't don't do none
[38:41] of those time that prophets very first
[38:46] words as quick as David said bring that
[38:49] man here I'll kill him that's done that
[38:51] he said David you won't die the very
[38:55] first words read it he said David you
[38:58] won't die cuz I prayed for you God made
[39:02] an acceptance through that prophet was
[39:06] no difference with David or anybody else
[39:09] but an honest and a contrite heart why
[39:14] would any thought be in our mind that we
[39:16] could get bow at any time well I don't
[39:21] have to tell my wife about running
[39:22] around because nobody knows it but mean
[39:32] mm-hmm
[39:35] yeah what about it what does it mean
[39:39] unconditional to you does it mean
[39:41] something like that did he doesn't
[39:43] matter what you do cuz I got another
[39:52] question coming behind this we might
[39:53] take another message but why would God
[39:57] give to Abraham and his seed a covenant
[40:09] but he never made it with mankind he
[40:17] never made it with all the seed of
[40:19] Abraham I'm quoting brother Branham
[40:22] we'll get to that one we'll get time did
[40:31] God just say well it don't make no
[40:32] difference what Abraham hears all this
[40:34] I'll just grab him he's a pretty good
[40:36] when I'll pick him up so you're not
[40:43] listening the Prophet said it like this
[40:49] and I got him here in front of me he
[40:53] said God knew he could trust Abraham to
[40:58] teach his children oh he just picked him
[41:09] up one mm-hmm we'll get to that in a
[41:13] minute just remember this covenant was
[41:17] never made now listen he made a covenant
[41:23] with Adam
[41:31] he didn't make the covenant with the
[41:33] world he made it with Adam come on he
[41:41] never made the covenant with the world
[41:43] he made it with Noah in his seen his
[41:49] children when he come to Abraham he
[41:52] never made it with nobody but Abraham
[41:56] and his seed singular which is Isaac
[42:10] what does it mean then the unconditional
[42:13] covenant can you just live like the
[42:14] devil and everything's okay you know
[42:19] that's the basis of what mankind teaches
[42:21] and one way or the other
[42:24] cuz come on if you get down to the base
[42:27] this people will say you think you
[42:29] perfect we all have problems don't we
[42:33] you know where you're eating off huh
[42:37] you're eating off the tree of knowledge
[42:40] because that's what mankind teaches
[42:43] that's what your churches teaches that's
[42:46] not what the Bible teaches the Bible
[42:49] says you've given account for every idle
[42:51] word or deed brother to hell no you're
[42:58] not gonna be lost we just remember
[43:01] another point right here if you live
[43:05] like the devil you're not saved anyway
[43:10] if you think you can get by with
[43:12] anything without God knowing it or
[43:14] anything like that then you're eating
[43:16] off the tree of knowledge then you're
[43:19] dooming your own sail you sure don't
[43:27] preach a good salvation message I'd like
[43:34] hear you preach it but I thought the the
[43:40] Bible in the message said Abraham was
[43:46] unconditional now number two question
[43:51] why did he give it to Abraham never the
[44:01] whole world full of people right
[44:05] probably as many peoples are now maybe
[44:08] not as far up to Abraham coming but it'd
[44:10] be pretty close
[44:11] they'd probably a few billion by the
[44:13] time Abraham come on the earth at least
[44:16] a few me young why do you pick Abraham
[44:28] remember where Abraham come from read
[44:31] you Bible he come from the earth Saudis
[44:35] which was a heathenism and your prophet
[44:40] verified death and he said Abraham come
[44:43] from even you know the Abraham wasn't a
[44:45] Gentile no he was a Jew boy you know a
[44:50] lot about your Bible don't you Abraham
[44:54] was a Gentile a healer and worshiper in
[45:01] God one day said Abram just get your
[45:06] family and head out of here to a land
[45:10] that I'll show you you want to talk
[45:17] about unconditional covenant you
[45:18] answered that question to me why did he
[45:20] choose a bride
[45:28] I'll put another question on the end of
[45:30] that why did you choose you oh now we've
[45:36] got a little more down whoring think
[45:37] about it right now we got to the point
[45:39] where we won't enjoy it a little bit why
[45:42] do you choose you hmm that's one of the
[45:49] people this message don't understand
[45:51] predestination the random said I'll give
[45:57] it to you the minute he said only the
[46:00] predestinated are considered in
[46:02] Redemption
[46:06] only the predestinated he said are
[46:09] considered in redemption there's an
[46:14] unconditional covenant that he made Wow
[46:25] so your thoughts runs on what I can get
[46:28] by with and can't get by with or do this
[46:30] is out of the other and how can it be
[46:32] done mine ain't even running that away
[46:34] mine's running why did God choose him
[46:42] got that down some races were choosing a
[46:45] Brian he wasn't the only good guy in
[46:49] lamp why'd he choose him
[47:03] after he chose him why'd he give him an
[47:05] unconditional covenant what'd he give it
[47:07] to him cause he he was gonna save him
[47:08] he's proving he's saying you can quote
[47:10] brother branham the remember there's a
[47:13] lot more to be said then once you're
[47:16] quoting you can find what you want in
[47:22] the message and justification of
[47:26] anything you think about can be found in
[47:29] the message but I don't mean this right
[47:34] so we're dealing with it on what an
[47:38] unconditional covenant that means you
[47:42] just do anything you want to if that's
[47:46] your thoughts of unconditional you don't
[47:53] matter what I do now you quote brother
[47:55] Branham Lee you're a good cool you no
[47:57] matter what I do is what he's done right
[48:03] but remember if I don't set what he done
[48:06] he can't do anything for me remember an
[48:09] unconditional covenant would mean he not
[48:11] save everybody in the world you ain't
[48:15] listening if he gave Abraham an
[48:21] unconditional covenant that meant there
[48:24] was no conditions no thoughts no ideas
[48:27] of anything whatsoever the way you're
[48:30] thinking then why didn't he say the
[48:32] world
[48:41] come on will you I thought I understood
[48:45] that until you started talking about you
[48:50] explain it to me is it okay for Abraham
[48:56] to do anything he wants to and God won't
[49:04] condemn him but everybody else gets
[49:08] condemned for doing any little thing I
[49:14] have to admit sometimes it looks like
[49:17] that until you wait on God to give the
[49:23] answer because that was David taking a
[49:25] man's wife away having the man killed to
[49:27] get his wife to cover up his sin
[49:31] condemning his own self and said bring
[49:33] the man here I'll kill him how many
[49:42] other people in the land got killed that
[49:44] year for doing the things David done
[49:50] come on grace stepped in grace said
[50:01] David he won't die cuz I prayed for you
[50:10] what if the Prophet had never said that
[50:14] David would have died because the law
[50:18] would have commanded it
[50:21] remember any mark against a high priest
[50:25] or anything like that automatic death
[50:32] why would God spare David then seemingly
[50:38] change the entire course of his word and
[50:41] his the way he had been with everybody
[50:48] you don't understand
[50:53] and that prophet not said what he said
[50:55] David was a dead man but he said David
[51:00] you won't die cuz I prayed for you
[51:14] got a lot of why's the main point is why
[51:23] would our thoughts of unconditional want
[51:25] to run into a situation they don't
[51:27] matter what we do we can get by with it
[51:31] now quote your prophet now quote the
[51:36] Bible the Bible says only Christians sin
[51:39] I'm quoting brother Branham down with it
[51:42] the Bible says only Christians sins
[51:46] because the sinners condemned on a
[51:48] higher level he just out of it may I
[51:50] quote you another one
[51:52] your prophet said you sin a sin as a
[51:56] Christian what'd he say
[52:01] come on some of you that steady the
[52:04] message that I what's the rest of that
[52:06] quote you sent us in as a Christian he
[52:10] said you'll reap a tubful I thought is
[52:14] unconditional I thought it's
[52:22] unconditional well now if it is
[52:25] unconditional how come he kill the other
[52:28] man you know you're gonna run real quick
[52:33] I know the human mind okay that works
[52:35] because if you said that to me I'd run
[52:37] real quick guys how many minds run that
[52:45] way this then he tried to justify some
[52:48] thought because he had run over here
[52:50] grab it say but he didn't make it with
[52:52] everybody he made it with Abraham now
[52:54] we're down to a point why did he make it
[52:58] with a brow you would have run that far
[53:03] with me I'll run with you not sarcastic
[53:06] I'm just trying to tell the truth what
[53:11] I'm trying to tell you is if you stay
[53:14] with the Word of God don't you worry
[53:15] about it in straight not ever little
[53:17] isn't and schism and whatever we've got
[53:20] if we'll believe it
[53:23] you sent us in as a Christian you're
[53:25] gonna reap a tubful out of it is it
[53:29] alright if you just go out and live in
[53:31] adultery and have kids and all kind of
[53:33] things and run all over the country as
[53:35] prostitutes and peel heads and and
[53:37] everything in the book but just you're
[53:40] gonna help me anyway could I believe in
[53:41] God I call I thought the new birth we'll
[53:53] get to it when we get there I thought
[53:55] the new birth was to come inside of us
[53:59] and live in us I thought that was the
[54:03] thing that could not happen in the Old
[54:05] Testament so now you've got an
[54:09] unconditional covenant in the New
[54:11] Testament that I just give you a couple
[54:14] of conditions with see the scene as a
[54:20] Christian reputable that's a Christian
[54:23] only Christian our sins giving the
[54:27] counter these done anybody whether good
[54:28] or bad that's New Testament that's
[54:35] telling you in the New Testament we
[54:36] can't live like the devil God don't live
[54:39] like the devil I thought the way we live
[54:43] was feeling what we were and then how
[54:48] much worse could it be how much worse
[54:51] could it be to live like the devil
[54:54] didn't do wrong and then try to use that
[54:58] to justify this unconditional I'm saved
[55:02] anyway
[55:03] if God saved me if you ever heard that
[55:05] one if God saved me
[55:08] this is his job to keep me clean it's
[55:14] your job to get in the bathtub
[55:17] all right you got a little bit do with
[55:21] it ain't like mama was mama wouldn't let
[55:27] us go to bed with the kids out playing
[55:29] in the dirt no we didn't get to go to
[55:31] bed until we washed our feet of course
[55:35] that was only about three or four inches
[55:36] at all you had to wash didn't matter
[55:38] about the rest of it they'd wash our
[55:42] feet before we went to bed
[55:48] listen church this has been on me for
[55:51] months and months so I got to get that
[55:53] part out at this point here what do you
[55:56] mean unconditional well he made a code
[56:03] with Abraham unconditional now let's see
[56:10] if we can put some thoughts with Abraham
[56:12] just a minute and run a little little
[56:18] thoughts in her mind
[56:22] first off God may have never made the
[56:28] Covenant in Abraham with the whole world
[56:34] he only made it to Abraham
[56:39] now come on you show me any words else
[56:42] what if he made right for him he made
[56:44] what everybody no way no no way you're
[56:49] out of the word you're out of the
[56:50] message yeah but you're trying to make
[56:54] yes that's what I'm trying to make it
[56:56] I'm trying to make it to a point that
[56:58] there was one man you won't talk about
[57:02] an unconditional covenant there was one
[57:04] man got an unconditional covenant
[57:13] right not the whole world
[57:17] God never made the Covenant with the
[57:19] whole world he only made it with Abraham
[57:24] you said in your mind and drive it down
[57:27] I know somebody it's backing out from
[57:28] because you can't father what I'm saying
[57:30] but listen he never made it with the
[57:35] whole world listen to brother branham go
[57:41] up to number one let's read it
[57:44] call Israel in the church listen to once
[57:48] your prophet had to say all right we
[57:51] find then taking the church back just as
[57:53] for a little preview found out that God
[57:56] promised Abraham he would save him and
[57:58] give him an unconditional promise what
[58:02] unconditional covenant he would save him
[58:07] and his seed not all his seed so the
[58:17] Covenant was not made with nobody but
[58:20] Abraham transmitted to Isaac I used the
[58:25] word where I wanted to brought down to
[58:28] Isaac if small was his son with no
[58:32] covenant now let's read what he said he
[58:38] gave you an unconditional code and he
[58:39] saved him and his seed not all his seed
[58:42] but his promised seed Isaac know what
[58:47] Abraham had eleven sons you know that
[58:52] only one of them was the promise through
[58:56] Isaac that's the reason Paul now watch
[59:00] him ain't chritmas scripture said in
[59:03] Romans and not chapter that all that are
[59:07] Israel are not Israel what did Paul say
[59:15] all the Israel is not Israel because
[59:17] there's only one chosen come on but
[59:22] through Isaac shall thy seed be called
[59:24] now then God through Isaac represent
[59:27] in Christ we noticed Christ was in
[59:29] Abraham and Christ was in Isaac Christ
[59:31] was a Jacob no so now you're coming down
[59:35] to the final point but just remember God
[59:38] never made to Crete never made an
[59:41] unconditional promise or covenant with
[59:44] nobody but one man well you sure don't
[59:50] give us the change I didn't write the
[59:58] book I wasn't a god it made the
[1:00:02] statement show me in the Old Testament
[1:00:08] where anybody outside of the seed of
[1:00:10] Abraham
[1:00:11] now listen the seed of Abraham through
[1:00:13] Isaac the seed of Abraham to East small
[1:00:18] had no promise oh yeah I'll give him a
[1:00:23] land I'll make him a nation I'll do
[1:00:25] these things yeah I'll go to you yeah
[1:00:27] I'll call these Abraham physical seed
[1:00:30] but there wasn't no promise made to
[1:00:33] nobody in the days of Abraham but to
[1:00:36] Abraham and then it said unto his seed
[1:00:41] not to 12 not to a small list through
[1:00:50] Isaac know if you've read your Bible
[1:00:54] then you surely should know but yet you
[1:01:03] say an unconditional covenant
[1:01:05] oh I understand an unconditional come
[1:01:16] why did God give the covenant to Abraham
[1:01:26] and him only now we're gonna hit a
[1:01:35] little line called predestination we're
[1:01:41] gonna see if we understand
[1:01:41] predestination not predestinated I'll
[1:01:47] make it but if I predestinated I'll
[1:01:49] guess I won't make it that's pretty good
[1:01:51] sense that's don't take a lot of
[1:01:53] knowledge does it if you is yes if you
[1:01:56] ain't you ain't what so this going out
[1:02:04] live like it know what that brother Dale
[1:02:09] I never thought about it I never thought
[1:02:12] about it it was just made with Abraham I
[1:02:14] thought it was made with the whole world
[1:02:16] I thought it was made into Noah for the
[1:02:20] whole world it would have been if they
[1:02:24] had accepted it walked in it it would
[1:02:27] have been to Adam if they'd accept it
[1:02:29] and walked in it it would be to the
[1:02:31] Israel if they would accept it and walk
[1:02:33] in it but they won't walk in it because
[1:02:37] then they're gonna prove whose seed is
[1:02:38] who okay go ahead and number three thy
[1:02:45] seed shall possess the gate of the enemy
[1:02:52] then when God seen that he had a man he
[1:02:59] could put confidence in
[1:03:07] he said I swore by myself now who's this
[1:03:13] guy he's got confidence in he's owned
[1:03:15] down here okay why did God choose
[1:03:22] Abraham then when God seemed that he had
[1:03:31] a man he could put confidence in he said
[1:03:33] I swore by myself
[1:03:35] for a man always takes an oath to
[1:03:37] someone greater than he and no one was
[1:03:40] greater than God so he swore by himself
[1:03:43] that the seed of Abraham would possess
[1:03:45] the gate of the enemy oh my he swore to
[1:03:48] God by himself swore that Abraham's seed
[1:03:52] would possess the gate of the enemy he
[1:03:56] goes on said and he proved it what about
[1:04:01] it drop over to 15 now and jump away
[1:04:09] over to Macy's right to the end 15 which
[1:04:11] is the message called the faith of
[1:04:13] Abraham you got it Darfur this is from
[1:04:20] the message of faith of Abraham what
[1:04:22] therefore by election he chose Abraham
[1:04:31] no it's unconditional he just picked out
[1:04:34] who he wanted you don't listen we just
[1:04:42] got through reading one quote in seeing
[1:04:46] that Abraham was chosen for a certain
[1:04:49] reason
[1:04:56] we're putting conditions on an Old
[1:04:58] Testament situation
[1:05:00] what are you believe it or not I'm not
[1:05:03] doing that your prophets doing this
[1:05:09] therefore by election he chose Abraham
[1:05:13] for he knew what Abraham would do you
[1:05:24] remember when he called him out there
[1:05:26] and said he'd he'd not keep the thing a
[1:05:29] secret from him when it was going down
[1:05:31] to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah he said
[1:05:33] for I know that Abraham will teach his
[1:05:35] children I know it God Himself I know
[1:05:42] that Abraham will send this message on
[1:05:44] down from one to the other generation
[1:05:50] but God for knowing that and knowing
[1:05:54] that Abraham would do it then he told
[1:05:58] Abraham in the beginning that he would
[1:06:00] save him and save his seat after him Oh
[1:06:12] give him the unconditional covenant that
[1:06:15] he made with Abraham not because Abraham
[1:06:19] was good that because God was good what
[1:06:24] about it seems now we're pulling a
[1:06:28] little bit in the Old Testament of
[1:06:30] finding for some reason not that God
[1:06:34] just give it to him at an unconditional
[1:06:36] no but there's some reason he chose him
[1:06:48] go Ahead's the next one 15a I guess you
[1:06:52] got it listed on there you can see it
[1:06:56] 4:15 there's a lot in between here so
[1:06:57] I'm Bob - Hall now Abraham was called
[1:07:01] by-election Abraham was election Isaac a
[1:07:05] justification Jacob was grace and Joseph
[1:07:07] is perfection now in the beginning when
[1:07:10] God called Abraham he called him not
[1:07:15] because he was a good man but because
[1:07:19] God foreknew Abraham God knew what
[1:07:24] Abraham would do he knowed Abraham he
[1:07:32] said I'll know that Abraham will raise
[1:07:36] his children to fear the Lord God knowed
[1:07:40] him God knows you but I don't understand
[1:07:48] an unconditional covenant it just means
[1:07:50] there ain't no conditions to it now
[1:07:54] we've got a prophet explaining
[1:07:55] predestination about the way God chose
[1:07:58] and how he chose Abraham
[1:08:09] how did you choose you wrote down I
[1:08:17] can't put it on nothing but
[1:08:19] unconditional in my life because then
[1:08:25] you don't fit with Abraham and remember
[1:08:30] now got him laying here in the
[1:08:32] scriptures and everything if you don't
[1:08:34] believe it raise your hand from Abraham
[1:08:38] the promise was made I gave it to you
[1:08:41] the other day from Abraham the promise
[1:08:44] was made to his seed after him
[1:08:46] and he said not as unto seeds then the
[1:08:51] same promise I read it to you life son
[1:08:54] or Wednesday or Sunday everyone else
[1:08:56] preached the same promise come from
[1:08:58] Abraham to Isaac and he said to Isaac
[1:09:05] your seed the seed of Isaac the Bible
[1:09:12] brings the seed of Galatians 3:16 and
[1:09:17] unto thy seed which is Christ all the
[1:09:22] way from the promise to Abraham by faith
[1:09:31] brother Dale then it would help you've
[1:09:33] left us all out because you've only got
[1:09:39] the condition with Abraham I didn't
[1:09:42] write the book now we got a long ways to
[1:09:45] go only you'll need separate 5 o'clock
[1:09:49] instead of that's not as you hope
[1:09:55] there's enough know in my mind of feel
[1:09:58] that length of time you see church as we
[1:10:06] leave the Old Testament form of talking
[1:10:09] we've got to remember one time ain't be
[1:10:13] any difference back dar then he is over
[1:10:15] here is that been the constant statement
[1:10:18] you can't make him one way here
[1:10:21] another way over here so here he is in
[1:10:23] the Old Testament with billions of
[1:10:26] billions of people in the 4000 years of
[1:10:30] the Old Testament you know what I mean
[1:10:33] everybody in the world and it
[1:10:35] reproducing and dying and going away and
[1:10:37] billions of billions of billions of
[1:10:39] trillions of people and yet God made a
[1:10:44] covenant with one man because that was
[1:10:48] the only man that he found in the earth
[1:10:51] that qualified to be his seed Abraham
[1:11:01] was the only man that qualified in any
[1:11:03] connection to be able to link to Jesus
[1:11:06] Christ I didn't write the book we made
[1:11:15] one of these days find out the Bible's
[1:11:17] right when it says fear not little flock
[1:11:22] we might find out like it was in the
[1:11:25] days of Noah when there was eight people
[1:11:28] saved out of a world full of billions we
[1:11:37] might find out that there was a handful
[1:11:39] of believers believed in Jesus Christ
[1:11:44] and it was you're walking the shores of
[1:11:47] Galilee
[1:11:54] well yeah we're all believers believers
[1:11:58] of what come on brother brother Brown
[1:12:03] don't say about predestination he said
[1:12:06] it wasn't that God chose one and didn't
[1:12:08] choose the other no one he said it's not
[1:12:14] that God puts you in a pop now I'm gonna
[1:12:17] let here feel me to read him raise your
[1:12:18] hand and pushes you through the other
[1:12:20] side and called you an overcomer
[1:12:25] he said how does God predestinate those
[1:12:31] that he foreknew he did predestinate so
[1:12:37] foreknowledge falls into view I don't
[1:12:47] understand you've got to hold those have
[1:12:51] some without it when one man no I I got
[1:12:55] the old Old Testament tied up with one
[1:12:57] man in his seed after him which was
[1:12:59] Isaac and from Isaac come who Jacob who
[1:13:03] comes down the lineages after work and
[1:13:05] from dark you come to Christ
[1:13:08] I remember you come to Christ you don't
[1:13:10] come to Mary and you surely don't come
[1:13:13] to Joseph with any human lineage is any
[1:13:16] human thought of lineages that you would
[1:13:18] talk about Jesus coming through David
[1:13:21] coming through the different ones that
[1:13:23] was brought it all winds up in Joseph oh
[1:13:29] you haven't read your Bible lately
[1:13:31] it ain't changed I read that in the
[1:13:33] Baptist Church you know still large
[1:13:37] since I read it in the Baptist Church
[1:13:41] that the natural lineage father it 14
[1:13:45] generations from here to here 14
[1:13:47] generates from here to here so means
[1:13:48] generation here to here he winds up in
[1:13:50] Joseph he don't go to it Mary
[1:13:58] Cody don't go to the women that's number
[1:14:02] one we still wouldn't fall right
[1:14:06] Marie might have been of a good lineage
[1:14:08] but she probably wasn't the lineage of
[1:14:10] the Joseph was Joseph come from the
[1:14:15] lineage got to remember it was told him
[1:14:17] which one was it
[1:14:19] oh well somebody help me which one that
[1:14:23] says out of his knees will come a ruler
[1:14:25] and it's not Jesus never come from no
[1:14:29] tribe of Levi but Judah out of Judah out
[1:14:34] of Judah comes the lineage down the
[1:14:36] Christ that's where you come through
[1:14:39] David and all those things there is no
[1:14:43] natural lineage coming to him because
[1:14:45] he's not God I mean not man he was God
[1:14:48] he's neither Jew nor Gentile he was God
[1:14:51] Rogers was Almighty God there's no
[1:14:55] Linnaeus to run him to but if you're
[1:14:56] gonna run your lineage you're gonna run
[1:14:58] aground in Joseph but no you ain't in
[1:15:01] the ground like you think I've been
[1:15:07] waiting a long time for somebody to
[1:15:09] preach this one without getting it
[1:15:12] messed up why did it go to Joseph I got
[1:15:19] a lot of wise about the Bible why did it
[1:15:22] go to Joseph why because he was the son
[1:15:28] of even the son of the sons only two
[1:15:29] competitors understood I'll tell you
[1:15:35] what
[1:15:36] you never hear nobody talk about Joseph
[1:15:42] too much well let me put a little bit in
[1:15:46] this message about him he's the prize of
[1:15:49] my eye because he was a man and a lot of
[1:15:57] things he done was wonderful
[1:16:00] he realized had he not accepted Mary
[1:16:06] number one now and many of the others
[1:16:11] would have done it you remember that God
[1:16:15] was in the Old Testament of when the man
[1:16:19] was told
[1:16:19] you know pay the right yeah
[1:16:23] man said huh I'm not gonna do it because
[1:16:26] if I do said I got to take Ruth and
[1:16:30] she's a Gentile and I ain't having
[1:16:33] nothing to do with it I will feel a lot
[1:16:39] of good stories Joseph was a wonderful
[1:16:44] man do you believe God when all he had
[1:16:52] was a dream fear not to take unto thee
[1:16:56] Mary thy wife a dream he goes and
[1:17:03] marries a woman to keep her from being
[1:17:05] killed because the law was killer she's
[1:17:09] pregnant before being married than any
[1:17:12] man Joseph took her as his wife are you
[1:17:22] with me can you put it back there with
[1:17:24] Ruth and Boaz and think about it back to
[1:17:27] her that guy says no I ain't gonna do
[1:17:29] that
[1:17:29] what was it Ben if you had a little
[1:17:31] woman come up to you and you said you
[1:17:36] know she said I'm pregnant it was
[1:17:43] automatic death and he was the one
[1:17:46] because she was engaged to him he would
[1:17:48] have had to cast the first stone
[1:17:51] but instead of casting a stone he cast
[1:17:54] salvation into her lot of the fact of
[1:17:59] saying I will redeem I'll take the
[1:18:05] responsibility of all this I know you
[1:18:09] don't like me that unnatural explain we
[1:18:11] just remember Joseph and Mary lived
[1:18:13] together for nine months and he never
[1:18:15] knew her
[1:18:15] I say he's a good man you make light of
[1:18:23] that if you want to guy say he was a
[1:18:24] good night
[1:18:26] you know here preached on Joseph - you
[1:18:30] got to be this got to be a woman got to
[1:18:32] be that part gonna be that one ending it
[1:18:39] with one thought
[1:18:43] God chose Abram because he knew what he
[1:18:51] do and he knew his seed would follow
[1:18:56] after him through Isaac not to east
[1:18:59] walls not to end the other would be
[1:19:01] through Isaac and through Isaac would
[1:19:03] come this one in this one in this one
[1:19:05] and it would come to Galatians 3:16 and
[1:19:08] to thy seed which is Christ not as seeds
[1:19:11] of many Paul said one seed of course
[1:19:18] everybody in the message is born with a
[1:19:20] seed in right oh you hear our seed
[1:19:25] doctrines they never preach the true
[1:19:29] seed and explain how did it come down
[1:19:33] and how that listen to what I'm saying
[1:19:37] how to end it who Abraham the Bible said
[1:19:47] he believed God it was counted unto him
[1:19:52] for righteousness
[1:19:55] right Joseph
[1:20:01] believe the dream it was counted unto
[1:20:03] him for righteousness
[1:20:08] can you believe God speaking to you why
[1:20:21] would we want to think about some
[1:20:22] unconditional situation that we can get
[1:20:25] by with right why would we think about
[1:20:30] something that it's just totally
[1:20:32] unconditional brother you don't
[1:20:33] understand it he just said he's gonna
[1:20:35] save him we didn't make no difference
[1:20:36] where he won't be saved or not I want
[1:20:39] the quote I won't now I can't get too
[1:20:43] close but I want to quote these things
[1:20:47] gonna save him whether he want to be
[1:20:49] saved or not because we remember old or
[1:20:53] new God cannot override your free moral
[1:20:58] agency and save you if you don't want to
[1:21:03] be saved
[1:21:05] now are we making a sensible thought of
[1:21:08] unconditional I said sensible cause it's
[1:21:13] still in my mind why would it be made
[1:21:14] into that thought of line and then God
[1:21:18] turned around and swore by it
[1:21:20] it's what I got all these scriptures in
[1:21:21] between here that God would Swire to
[1:21:25] Abraham but you see that comes right
[1:21:30] down to where you and me are had because
[1:21:33] we got to be the seed of Abraham by
[1:21:34] faith you and I are not Jen not Jews but
[1:21:38] remember Abraham wouldn't you either so
[1:21:42] quit trying to be a Jew try to be an
[1:21:45] Israelite well you'll get there one of
[1:21:48] these days go remember jacob's name had
[1:21:53] to be changed to Israel and then he
[1:21:58] could have the twelve sons right he
[1:22:03] wasn't anybody else bringing him twelve
[1:22:05] sons you had to come to Jacob and then
[1:22:10] get Jacob changed to Israel cuz even
[1:22:12] Isaac and all that
[1:22:14] it wouldn't come out like I write see
[1:22:17] the word is right
[1:22:23] he knew what Abraham would do I know
[1:22:30] that Abraham will raise his children to
[1:22:34] fear the Lord God knowed him God knows
[1:22:40] you what about it
[1:22:48] could it be
[1:22:50] oh brother Tom love this one could it be
[1:22:53] that we trigger our predestination
[1:22:56] brother Pablo is one of his favorites he
[1:23:01] said could it be we trigger our
[1:23:03] predestination sister Gayle could it be
[1:23:06] the fact that we believe God when others
[1:23:09] would not believe him it's not how good
[1:23:11] your life is see there's you do's and
[1:23:13] don'ts come on you tryin to find
[1:23:19] something to make you and I'll tell you
[1:23:21] to do this if you'll do it I read them
[1:23:24] and I studied them cuz I've been doing
[1:23:26] it for two or three weeks I wish you
[1:23:29] would type into your computer
[1:23:32] unconditional covenant 180 some 870 snow
[1:23:41] I forgot exactly it's a large number of
[1:23:44] times they brought around amused and I'd
[1:23:47] like for you to read every one of them
[1:23:49] and I'd like for you to find in all of
[1:23:53] that quotes that he has any thought
[1:23:58] whatsoever that it doesn't matter what
[1:24:01] we do or don't do were saved
[1:24:05] anyway because when you start reading it
[1:24:12] this is what you're going to find you're
[1:24:17] gonna find the total opposite because
[1:24:23] you're gonna find the quotes is running
[1:24:26] to the bases
[1:24:28] that we think we can get by with
[1:24:31] anything hi for that way the other hive
[1:24:36] is condemning us constantly about what
[1:24:40] we do and don't do never a
[1:24:44] middle-of-the-road I never found out of
[1:24:46] all that I read of those things I didn't
[1:24:48] read everyone but I got pretty close I
[1:24:51] never found a one where he ever said it
[1:24:54] don't matter what you do because that
[1:25:00] would be totally contrary to any form of
[1:25:03] God's thinking and by foreknowledge I
[1:25:11] just don't get it I don't understand it
[1:25:13] pray and listen and think it's never
[1:25:22] been what you do or don't do
[1:25:23] I'm interstate it one more time Adam was
[1:25:28] saved by grace okay Noah will save my
[1:25:35] grace
[1:25:37] Abraham was saved by grace that not of
[1:25:44] works lest any man should boast and I
[1:25:48] love it to where that scripture that's
[1:25:50] one of my favorites I guess where's that
[1:25:52] abraham believed god and it wasn't
[1:25:54] counted unto him for righteousness
[1:25:56] why cause he believed him as I said well
[1:26:01] ago what would you be if you were the
[1:26:03] man and you your future wife was there
[1:26:05] and she was pregnant she doing you know
[1:26:07] in a dream at night and something says
[1:26:09] go ahead and marry oh this is me it'd be
[1:26:18] hard to do folks
[1:26:26] right be hard to do what they done it
[1:26:34] cuz they proved that they were the seed
[1:26:37] of Abraham that would believe God
[1:26:40] regardless of all the things that would
[1:26:44] ever take place that they believe you
[1:26:57] how about it
[1:27:01] okay don't know if you might have any
[1:27:06] need without prior you know how no music
[1:27:08] will do nothing will go right on the end
[1:27:10] of the rest of the service you know they
[1:27:13] can
