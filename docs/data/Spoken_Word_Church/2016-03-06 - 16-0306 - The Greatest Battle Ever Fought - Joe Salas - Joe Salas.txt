TRANSCRIPT
========================================
okay good morning good morning before we do in english for the bottle open that tiny school but that's crap spies or Jesus we thank you God for allowing us to come together to hear more about you or pretty too up and out of our heart and understanding or grin upgraded to remember all those it couldn't be here today and they're sick and afflicted remember wait is it created better going this morning granted voted she'll be with us this morning where the services it with your name yes I'm brother Joe itself you'll have to deal let's turn it on to first Peter five and love 88 and then to 10 worst 510 a 2d said beast over there don't eat because your adversary the devil and roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may evolve more resistant to step path and baton on that the same afflictions are accomplished and your brother and there are in the world but the god of all grace who has called us on to his eternal glory by Jesus Christ after they do have supper law make you perfect establish strength and settle you now let's go to Ephesians chapter 6 verse 10 to 17 said finally my brother them be strong in the Lord in the power of his might put on a whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against their world the devil when we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of the world this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take on to yourself the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand in the evil day having done all to stand stand therefore having a longer to heaven on their breasts place roaches net and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all things that Sheila fate where you shall be able to quench over very dark period darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God I was wondering read another scripture we got so much stuff to cover so I'm going to skip that LeBron said a devil is almost all most harmless I let's even have somebody to work in and that's the way God does too he has to have us he's dependent on us to work through he said now do you know we have wars up two wars and rumors of wars and the Earth's tank will have plenty more Wars but do you realize there's only two powers in all the universe all of the other difference between nations and differences between each other and everything at all mounts up to two powers there's only two power there's only two kingdoms to pursue and to Kingdom all the rest the little minor things are connected either one of those powers and those parties Gus power and Satan power that's what every war every disorder everything that comes along as either controlled by God's power or Satan's power so that's how it to power their dearest and that is the power about life and the power of death that's not a two-parter so we had to choose between life and death now we should already which site want to be and Satan can only his part only pervert it you know he's only got the power that God gives in to like it did with Joel you can do what you want but you can't touch his life so I normally at first and getting ready for a battle first upset got to be a select asst some soldiers they got to be dressed for fighting they got to be trained for fighting can you imagine going on the war and you don't have no life on or nothing you've done so we had to be equipped if we want to fight the road and I believe that the greatest battle that our squad is now ready to go on that song I believe that God has been said select any soldiers I believe he's being dressing them training them and the battle super Mel C getting ready to start this first grade metal it was her fault beginning heaven when Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer and his angel it first started the first bed was in heaven so sin did not originate on earth it originated in heaven and then it was thrown down from heaven Tesla I heaven to the earth I fell on human being then the bell from angel became human battles and same come to destroy God's creation what God had created to be for himself he has same come to destroy that that's what is / was to destroy it from then the battle began here on earth and again in us and we have been raging ever since now before a battle can be put in the rate of first they have to choose a meeting ground or place where the battle is to be fought he said when this great battle started on earth they had to be a mutual place there the big place select for the battle to begin and for the Bibble read and that battle ground began than their mind they're actually the battle store the human mind was chosen for the place of the bell so decisions are made in the mind there's were say meet you and decisions or because they've got made a man that way but what is that choose isn't it the horror of the soul he said that he got census see text field spell here they're all right but don't trust them unless they agree with the world they all right but if this they disagree really worked on listening to them imaginations conscious memory reasonable effects of it all right if they agree with a world but your affection doesn't agree with the work get rid of it you said that's your battleground you're better learning it back here and that one in the beginning back here in the soul back in your mind it opened up the mind is the gate to the soul you said the gate of spirit whether you might open i set the spirit or to reject the spirit you can have little consciously little feelings a little sensation all this thing that has nothing to do it that's just little sensations and things but when it comes to reality your mind opens it up you either accept it or reject it see it's your mind has opened up the door opposed to the door and listened to your consciousness listen to your memory listen to your affection but when your mind calls itself to these things and make up the spirit of this world come in it blows the rest of the stuff up every dollar is going every fear is going everything station of doubt it's gone every feeling is gone there's not him there but the war of God and Satan cannot battle against it well sure you cannot battle against it now you hear me ok oh that's a problem in four starts but give God that might give God work the first place a man can't even come to god he can't sin here it is American on sin until first he kisses outside God's Word he can't even sing that's disbelief until a person gets railed I work work the presence of God he cannot sin there there's a bell at first the very first try mine but that's not you prevention Tony use a 22 rifle is that let's use an atomic bomb and what is the atomic bomb if they had th and his word faith in his work he said God is training for this great battle Matthew said there and also Dale said there will be a time of trouble such as never liked enough before and we're living in a time when culture education thing this mother of the world the Word of God and got it into recent and so for the battles now who will stand a fellow radical and she's the right now look what a great opposition we got younger who would be like there is that you stand let the uncircumcised police think that part of them the father armies of Living God holla go fight him and man hello once men and women this morning blue can raise up and say I'll take the Lord at his word so David you were or still you know he was anointed to be king no matter whatever the giant wasn't he says that the brains of the army lays in the captain thing Teletoon is that roma Roma in Germany was the brains of Germany not Hitler I say horror military man hadn't those men were at the front it depend on which way they get over you follow your captain if he survived kind of a general it is a right if he's a force or Jam his pocket he's been proven to be right for him though he may seem wrong to you to go on to the front do as he is told he said we got a five star general would run first door down spell j esus Jesus yes place him faster than us fe idea was to fade he's never lost a battle City conquer dead hell on the grid if the tables out of the way is the great ship captain so the devil isn't isn't even in the picture these are America addresses are soldiers in the best they can have to dress with steel helmets and armors or whatever they got armor thanks for every God God dress his army what kind of equipment we use the spirit of the sword the Word of God amen the Word of God is sharpening that to a sword people's for Pierce and hit into a thunder boom given the narrow of the bone even at the sir that top of the mind the Word of God to believe his work and that's the way God armor he said here we see the Texas tactics of the devil how do we do now I got a lot of scripture here a profit of pants where we come to them and different people through the Bible and done the same thing it's always a step that is to try to get the people to disbelieve the world we're listen your soldiers of the cross when you just believe one word of God cuz written Bible your disarm it says same army bring this easy that's what say that he's a destroyer saying the whole team not Satanists sickness dead and sorrow frustrations and were worried all on Satan god is love faith joy peace and so on brother Brown said devil don't have to fire a shot he's got us shooting at each other to say he's got one punch coming at you whatever your weakness it its cover that spot it's going to hurt it a bit yeah be careful the way we talk to each other because God is Dennis people so I thought I talking bad about football for fellas or anybody you talking bad luck on what I'm saying something so John 15 12 this is karma Matt this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you let's go to John 13 34 35 a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you did you also love one another by this shall all men know that you are my disciples and if you have loved one that you have love one to another e now we're here they're not to serve ourself here to serve each other we do that you're staring heaven and the face it said that when you're in the army of the soldier gets wounded you don't you don't need nobody behind you don't leave no man behind so when a brother or sister gets hurt or somebody hurt so we help them to come up we're all one body of Christ so when somebody gets hurt somebody tells them something something we help them pick them up and even look in the other one if you have to you of you have to carry them no no no man is left behind like Moses said we're going with all with our young horses and cows or where were you all right nobody left mine now the devil already has that people in the world I mean they already killing each other Levin said that pressure is going to be like that well well well still

across you know actually this week a 14 yo morning shoots the pizza man yeah and then in the pizza and be happy late last week a man wrote this other guy he told him give you all the money is wallet he had one dollar who wallet and they caught him he spent 15 years in prison so he's already got Stan we do it and they want when you're an army you have two uniformed you have a class a uniform you but brother Richard you know what a nice timing but that's to go to parades or look nice or vontade but when you're doing your training and when you're not in the battle of something you were called for taste so I don't think we need that x double because we're in a battle every day so we need to wear for taste another he dressed be dressed for bed so when you break man's laws or when you bet break glass laws you have to pay but then i went for 15 years for one dollar so so we would break God knows we got paid correct but nowadays a nobody wants to take responsibility for their own actions they always want to learn something sure well it kiddo error on it boys my shoulder and mother said that policeman you should my son my son didn't do anything you robbed a liquor store he beat up the
