========================================

um we finished up the book of Hebrews and I was just uh I I've really been wanting to study this book that I'm going to start today which is kind of an odd book that you would think you know we'd want to study on Daniel or Revelation or something like that but I felt led to study the Book of Job and I don't know how long we'll stay on this might be brief but um uh there's a lot of chapters and it's very wey to get into um but um today we're not going to be using slides I just want to just just talk about it um so if you'll turn in over to to the Book of Job chapter 1 and we'll mainly look at we'll probably start at from verse 20 and read to the end of of the chapter let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word and to be able to gather together with your people today Lord and we just thank you for all the promise as you've given to us Lord and thank you for the encouragement This Book of Job can give us to us as we go through life struggles and and uh the trying times of life and I pray God that it'll just give us strength strength and encouragement today Lord that you'll just be with your people and be with the service Lord that you'll feel that Liberty to move Among Us Lord Jesus be with brother Chris as he's study and preparing help us now we pray in your name um I think uh let well let's let's read this scripture for we'll start at verse 20 um drop all the way down to the end and uh and you think you know as we'll relate in a moment all of this horrible thing all these horrible things that just happened to job and then it says then job arose and rent his mantle and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshiped that seems like an odd thing to do after a lot of bad things have happened to you do to worship and said naked came out of my mother's womb and naked shall I return thither the lord gave and the Lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the Lord in all this job sined not nor charged God foolishly now really you read you read the book of job and it's probably the most depressing book in the Bible you read all these things these horrible things it happened to job and uh but really it's one of the most important books because it frames up how you know we it's got we've got all these questions of life and why do things happen and why are things why are things the way they are but the Book of Job God gave us this book so that we could understand how God runs his program how God runs the world and to answer the questions of life when you get to a spot and you're wondering why why is are things like this why why is it like this well job had a lot of those questions too and it's four friends that came and talked to him and and uh so the Jo The Book of Job helps us to understand things when when we're going through it helps us to frame up like you start thinking maybe that that if you serve God that nothing bad will ever happen to you or you you it helps you understand you know you see all this wicked done in the world and but the wicked seems like they prosper and nothing bad happens to them what what's going on and you know all of us have questions like that it helps job sure did what what what is happening why are things the way they are and Job chapter 14 if you keep reading it says job 14:1 says man that is born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble now that sums sums up a lot doesn't it that life is just full of suffering you know you sit there in the hospital room watching watching all my kids born and you when you come into the world it's it's just terrible watching a baby being born and watching all the labor and the uh the trial and the crying there's crying and suffering tears and the baby comes into the world crying and it's just suffering and you watch them and you sitting there thinking well I better have some insurance because you know what if something happen what if somebody get sick and and and and uh you because life is just full of suffering you see suffering on every hand everywhere you you go to the playground at school and it's suffering kids making fun of one another and and uh not the whole because the whole world is in this sin condition and nothing's the way that it should be and uh plants are dying and the world's getting worse and worse and it's it's and you grow old and and and and there at the end it's just suffering suffering and that's because of what job says there in job 14:1 man that is born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble and I think all of us can bear record if you've lived long at all that you look back in your life and it's full of trouble just trouble on every hand trouble everywhere you look trouble you know even even when you're born again it's suffering I I I I want to tell you when I was born again it was it was not easy you're laying there and you're struggling and you're trying to you there's some there's desperation and you're trying to get somewhere and you're you want God to come on the scene and and and do something and you're not maybe maybe you're in that state where you don't really understand it but you want something to happen you don't know what it what's going to happen but you want something to happen and the whole thing is suffering cuz when life comes and the this life you're just going to have suffering there's suffering in birth there's suffering in the New Birth they're suffering in life and they're suffering as we go down to the grave and now now let's in our mind let's lay aside all that you know that we're going to a Rapture we're going to a body change let's lay that to side for a second and just think about suffering because so far there's been a Ono one everybody that's been born has matched one to one with everybody has gone to the Grave there hadn't been anybody that has escaped going to the Grave because because everything is just suffering your your destiny if if if if we don't come to a body change if you don't come to that place your destiny is going to be going down into the grave because man's days are few and full of trouble now you might ask that question how can you see all that pain and suffering all this pain and suffering this is the one of the questions that the Book of Job answers all this pain and suffering and still be a Christian how can you still how can you look at these things and and and and and still believe in a in a good God and all these kind of things but I I I don't think that we could see and endure all this pain unless we were a Christian now that's right you you see all this all these all these people I I just don't know how people could live out in the world with and endure all the suffering and things and not have the rock of Revelation that we have not have something to hang on to that's what keeps us that's that's what that's what job what job got so low until he said the lord giveth and the lord taketh away but you get so low till everything has been Stripped Away the only thing that remains might be your faith your faith is like your faith like we know in the New Testament is compared to a rock you know you ever you ever been eating a sandwich or something and you hit you bit down on a rock like a little Pebble or something and it and and it's that's how like you you're we're just made up of like a bag of Flesh and water and everything and but down on the inside there's a stone yes a stone that you strip everything else away and All That Remains will be your faith and it's down on the inside and that's what job got Stripped Away until there was nothing left nothing left but I I believe God I know that in My Flesh that I shall see God I know him and and and you could take everything away from job and all that remained was I'm not going to curse God and die like his wife told him to I'm not going to you could take everything away from me but yet I'm going to serve God Amen I don't need wealth or fame or popularity or good place in the community I don't need anything I don't need any reward from God to trust him that was just J's testimony I will serve him no matter what yes see it's it's what I know it's what we know and who we know that carries us through the rough times in Job chapter 19 he said for I know that my redeemer liveth I know my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in My Flesh shall I see God whom I shall see for myself and my eyes Shall Behold and not another though my Reigns be consumed within me Reigns is an old archaic word for your kidneys because they believed in the old old timey days that your kidneys is where that source of all of your your your your inner you know if everything Stripped Away that he KN he still had that confidence that Christ is at the end of the road now that's what our confidence is when everything's Stripped Away and you feel like you just can't keep going on and and and and all just you're compassed about with suffering on every side but Christ is at the end of the road now loss and pain and suffering usually comes with a lot of questions and that's why this book of Job is the book that has the most questions out out of any book of the Bible there's 330 questions in this book and the and the most of any other book might be Matthew or some of the others have like maybe 150 questions something like that but this book has more questions because when you're going through a rough time when you're going through trial you're going to have a lot of questions like why me why why is this happening to me or why them or why now or why this like job job asked there was a lot of questions in the Book of Job like why why do the wicked live on Growing Old and increasing in power that's a good question to look at you look at somebody else why some look at somebody evil people in political positions of power people in government and it looks like they don't care about writing wrong why are they prospering it looks like the righteous are going through such hard times and the righteous get abused like little lambs they get thrown over to the side of the way and looks like the devil just runs a rough shot over them what what's going on why is it like that in Job chapter 11 can you God ask job this question or uh this question is asked of him can can you fathom the mysteries of God can you probe the limits of the almighty and Job 38 where were you when I laid the found Earth's Foundation tell me if you understand and God was asking job that question to kind of frame up in his mind you think you think you understand you think you know and we think we know sometimes but sometimes there's just not a good answer that might be the summation of the Book of Job sometimes you just got to trust God in Job 38 have you ever given orders to the morning or shown the dawn its place does the rain have a father who fathers the drops of dew know every morning you get up and you can see dew falling on the grass and there's where does it come from how does it happen and you sometimes you just got to trust God oh yeah the god that makes the Dew fall on the grass that same God is is running things the way he wants to and that same God is running your life if you'll just trust him and turn everything over to him and trust that he's at the end of the road Jo got a lot of questions in it cuz we have a lot of questions when we go through suffering yet job such a strange story cuz it's the opposite of a rags to Rich a story we we like we like the Disney sto kind of stories you know where somebody starts out with nothing and they end up with everything but this this now now just laid the ending to the side for a moment but this is a story about somebody that had everything and it all got Stripped Away and that's where something really happened you could really see you can really see somebody's Faith shine when everything's Stripped Away and that's what makes it bothersome why would all these calamities befall a righteous man if something bad was going to happen it shouldn't have happened to job job was doing everything right job was making sacrifices for his children job was job was an upstanding citizen of the land job was doing everything according exactly according to plan he was doing everything right why would why would something bad happen to job why would all this T and not just something bad but everything possible bad everything that could happen to job happened to him except for his life taken away he had every even his wife was saying won't you just Curse God and die everything was taken away from it why do the righteous Suffer Well one reason is because they can take it and and see we we we've got to take it because The Crucible of life is where our character is molded and framed into the way that God wants us to be it's it's The Crucible of life that forms our character character is the thing that we're coming out of life with the character is the thing you'll go into the other world with and character when you go through all these things it just strips away everything everything except for the kind of Godly character that want God wants to see then he can look at you and see well well that person is responding to situations in the right way he's looking he's trusting me no matter what comes no matter what happens he's trusting me the the fiery Crucible like in Proverbs chapter 17 it says the fining pot oh yeah is for silver and the furnace for gold but the Lord trith the hearts you know in that message the e as the eagle stirreth their nest brother brandom used this story as an example of how God tries his Eagles tries his Eagle he'll put you through a little fire to see if you're going to spread your wings or not he wants to he wants to put you in a little situation to see if you're going to spread your wings and Soar Off the mountain toop or how you're going to react oh in Isaiah 48:10 he said behold I have refined thee but not with silver I have chosen thee in the furnace of Affliction now that's the part of Christianity we don't like in it that we're chosen in the furnace of Affliction Christianity is not a flowery bed of ease is it life is not a flowy B of ease it it's straight up terrible it's terrible many times it's horrible oh but that's where you can have something real real beautiful you can't have a you can't have a rose without a thorn you got to have the Thorns first and then you got a rose you you got to have all the Pricks and everything before you get the rose but then you got a rose that smells good and you can see the fragrance coming out in Malachi chapter 3 he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver and he shall purify the sons of Levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may offer unto the Lord an offering and righteousness and you think about all the things in your life that must be refined away all your pride and your arrogance and your self-reliance all mine has to be refined away all of our worldliness and Reliance on the world and love of the world and our materialism has got to be refined away all of our doubt our lack of faith has got to be refined away yes sir that where we trust God no matter what happens all of our impure motives all of our sinful habits and behaviors and all of our lukewarmness has got to be refined away where we come to church and we don't care and we don't care about one another it's got to be refined away and you know what'll take care of where you don't have empathy and where you don't have that kind of character is where you go through a little refining fire Let the Fire of God mold you and move you and you'll all of that will be baked out where there's no hypocrisy left where there's no somebody that can't forgive their brother you go through some hard times and then you look at your brother a little bit differently right your impatience and all of your lack of compassion has got to be refined out it's got to be fired out that's why you know we we go through life and we we're mocked and shamed you might be shamed because of the way you dress and the way that you live you might be made fun of you think think about all the times you in school you were bullied and made fun of and maybe as a Christian bully those are thing situations that God allowed you to go through and it's hard and it's it's rough and the situations in life they're terrible but they're for a purpose to bring you to a place and you go through tragedy and sorrow and heartache where you just feel like you're just ripped apart and you're just being crushed in the wine press of God's Wrath and you just can't hardly bear it anymore like Jesus there in the Garden of Gethsemane where his he's so so much stress until his blood and his and the water was separated from the blood and he was dripping out great great drops because because of the stress and God will allow us to go through times where we we just can't even sleep at night wake up at 3:00 in the morning and you're like what what's going on this doesn't seem like a a nice Christian peaceful life that I thought it would be and God allows these things because we've got to be refined now you look at Job chap 1:9 as we're about to close here and this is this is the scripture that the whole book of Job hangs on because this is the question that's got to be answered and this is the question that's got to be answered in your life Satan answered the Lord after the Lord pointed out job what about job all these all these things were playing out in that Divine counsel in heaven Satan answered the Lord and said doth job fear God for not now that's a a very strange question but the question that's being posed is it does does job just does he fear God just because he's expecting to get something what about you and I if the flly we bit of ease is yanked away from us are we still going to trust God if that thing that you hold most precious is yanked away from you what what about you are you going to still trust God a refined believer will serve God for nothing I don't have to get nothing in return I don't have to get any money a refined believer will serve God for no popularity if everybody in the church hates you if everybody in the world hates you you'll still serve God a refined believer will serve God for no money preachers don't oh it's we're not preaching the gospel for money what what if we didn't get paid what if we didn't get any money would we still serve God you got to serve God for nothing no gold no silver what if all of your family turned against you and all of your family said the way that you should believe is is heresy but you're not serving God for family you're serving God for nothing no happiness that's right no shelter what if your shelter was taken away and you like Jesus they had nowhere to lay his head nothing but the dens nothing nothing but no church no congregation what if you had nothing what if all the church doors were closed would you still serve God job did everything was yanked away from job and he had nothing left and he said the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord no matter what Satan does to me no matter what God does to me I'm still going to serve God and job 1:12 said and the Lord said unto Satan behold all that he hath is in thy power only upon himself put not forth thine hand and so all job had left was ashes now you think about that that's all job had was ashes and he still was willing to serve god with nothing but ashes nothing but ashes and a little pot shirt a little piece of a broken pot to to satis itching like crazy itching like mad and just wanted some belief and there in his Despair and his suffering with his wounds oozing all he had to do was just scrape scrape and scrape and scrape on that on that pile of ashes and he had nothing left but his faith and he wouldn't he wouldn't let that go you think about all that God allowed to be taken away 7,000 sheep and 3,000 camels and 500 Yol of oxen and 500 donkeys and all of his servants and his children seven sons and three daughters and then he in chapter in in Job chapter 2 all of his health was taken away so he didn't even have his health and all of his social standing and respect where all of his friends came around and began to mock him and say you're the one you're the problem you're the reason why this happened wow all of it was taken away and job 2:8 says and he took him a pot shirt to scrape himself with and he sat down among the ashes and his wife said unto him Dost thou still retain thine Integrity Curse God and die all job had were ashes and misery and he still served God Amen a righteous life is not an easy life now sometimes we look for when when when Calamity befalls us or bad things happen we look for a simple answer a simple reason for why it's happening and I'm about to close but in John 9: 1:3 Jesus explains sometimes it's not as simple as somebody made a mistake and there're that's why they're they're in a you know something bad happens he said as as Jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth and his disciples asked him saying master who did Sin this man or his parents that he was born blind and Jesus answered neither hath this man Sinn nor his parents but that the works of God should be made manifest in it and the message of the Ark brother R said you might be sick for a little while you may have to go through something for a little while but remember Christ is at the end he never said this artc will set in a little Whirlpool like that well there'll be no calm just as calm as it can be no sir he never carried a flower bed of ease he never promised things easy but he promised Grace to sustain you in the time there's no promise well let me skip over that and we'll we'll go to the end here and close on this close on this thought that right there in the midst of all that trial when everything had been Stripped Away that it says that job worshiped and you know true worship comes from knowing god and job knew his maker and John chapter 4:24 says God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth so you can't worship without the truth in Matthew chapter 15 it says for in vain they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men so your worship is wrong if you're not worshiping according to the truth but if you have have the truth that surpasses everything if everything's taken away and you've got the truth then you can worship God bless you we'll leave you with that thought [Applause]
