to you welcome and now only you just part of us so it's not that but we we had it in on notes this morning but you know how I do when I start reading those notes down I try to stay away from that but also we heard at lunchtime that they was operating on brother Herman Garland there for the gallbladder so we pray and hope that everything by now would be okay and out of the way you know all is well we thank you thank the Lord for being with him amen so just you like turning you scriptures turn to Hebrews 6 and Revelations 1 where we were reading this morning try to continue our thought on uh

understanding is our prayer because we're in the day and time when Lord it is so needful to know spiritually who who you are and what's going on in our place and what we're doing Lord Just Have Your Way Now guide us and just as we read your word you speak to our hearts we love you and thank you in Jesus name amen Hebrews 6 tell them just come on in just come on in brother and sisters it's come on down there's more seats closer to the front and difference you may have to kind of move over a little bit but it finds you a seat glad to have you with us a lot of them I recognize the face is coming in so you know what our saying always is here and we know that there is some here that have not been here before but we have a little SA in here that if you come one time you're a visitor all right so we welcome you as a visitor but if you come two times you're just part of us cuz we don't have anything here to join up with and all good seed real Sund you know we just we're just part of the body of Christ and we pray that you would just uh you know take that as love from our hearts that we welcome you uh back with us but we welcome the visitors CU that's the ones that hadn't been here before we say to you welcome amen we're reading from Hebrews 6 Hebrews 6 and then from Revelations 1 Hebrews 6 Revelations 1 Hebrews 61 says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward god of the doctrines of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment and this will we do if God permit now like I've been making the statement to you for quite a while Paul saw many many things prophesied of many things spoke of many things to come that he was not able to attain unto but yet he saw them and as far as what he saw is much a reality as to literally being there cuz that's the way the prophet saw it and they would when theyd see something it was like they were there they said about nonon seeing chariots josling in the streets well he saw down to our day when you got Buicks and O mobiles running up and down the expressway the prophet said and running with some cuz non saw him running like torches see they had lights on cars and well he actually saw that but how could he describe that he'd never heard the word Buick it wasn't in existence and expressways and that so he said chariots jostling in the streets but they saw what they saw so that that's what Paul saw it but he wasn't able to attain cuz he's in the grave he was able to make the change that he even literally prophesied of because it wasn't time thank God he didn't you know what cuz you know why cuz we wouldn't be here right if he if he had went there then it wouldn't we wouldn't be here right okay now let's go to Revelations 1 Revelation 1:1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him now notice to show unto him servants things which must come to pass and he sent and signified by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand amen you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word I understand the brother was is a missionary from Honduras that right yes from Honduras from Honduras um let's see used to know a brother there brother did you know a brother named LeAndre little bitty brother name LeAndre he was from Honduras but we're glad to have you with us now we've been speaking for some time about what Paul was saying to the Hebrews and you know they understood a lot of things that's what he was saying he said we we understand the uh doctrines of Christ we understand the resurrection of the Dead we we understand that uh Eternal judgment now he wasn't saying it was eternal hell no cuz that won't work he said Eternal judgment because once God's judgment is set the Judgment itself is eternal he said we understand all those things we understand the godhead we understand the baptisms you know it's plural there too which would be water baptism we understand how to do that we understand the baptism of the Holy Ghost and when it came and what it was to do and things but he said now leaving the principles he call those things principles all right principles in our human language means foundations this building is setting upon a foundation all right now so when Paul was saying leaving the principles he wasn't saying they're no good throw them away you know no no he saying that's what holding us up right cuz according to the Bible we're built on what right the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets so he wasn't saying throwing it away but what was he saying he saying let's go on right right amen go on unto Perfection right all right now was it said he said there this we will do if God permits but God never permitted Paul to go on unto the Perfection that you and I are looking for right you had to go by the grave right and according to Hebrews 11:40 they without us not be made perfect right so he's waiting on you and I amen all right to bring him out of the grave and right cuz Perfection there is meaning uh not totally just completion but that's what he's talking about but it's meaning to car it to the highest height and anything can be brought to right and the highest height of all mankind would be what what is your desire what is the highest thing you could think of having a million dollars put it in the bank you broke tomorrow amen one sign of the pen and big old companies right there was worldwide companies one stroke of the pen and they belong to the government so that couldn't be what we' be want right Health okay we'd all like to be healthy we'd all like to be young again you know but you just get old that's right amen and I went through it one time I don't want to go through it again I've enjoyed life but I don't want to have to go back through it again right so that the Apex of my heart to what the inection I want to come to is a change of this body amen that's right the Rapture okay right and I believe this is the age I believe we're the people that will take the change amen all right and in believing that that way then I believe we have received as I was expressing this morning I don't believe that we need another Prophet no we've had the life Prophet that was promised to the Gentile dispensation when brother Ram came and brought the message that was the last Gentile Prophet now what we call major I believe in a five-fold ministry right am right and in the five-fold ministry you got Apostles prophets evangelist pastors teachers but none of them is the church age Messenger right right we've had the church age messenger we've had the one that was come to to be promised according to Malachi that would turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers and this being the the fourth coming of Elijah that would be in our day I believe that's already transpired right am but I believe what he said he said the fivefold ministry would take this message and break it down to the people amen all right now that's our job then right until we all come right as the scripture says to the unity of the faith the Revelation that we're supposed to come to so then we're not looking for another Prophet to come we have Great Men Among Us that can carry this message on I believe around the world the Bride of Jesus Christ is receiving the message of the hour amen and progressing on and and then that way it's not my responsibility to be all of it it's not yours it's a worldwide body of Jesus Christ amen and in being that then we each one have our part right but once we put all the parts together I mean may be a little Honduras part connected to a Georgia part you know because that's what it's got to be I mean if you're talking about a body the body of Christ right then you know I mean the best you can do my fingers are still different you know I mean you can say well now you got the same fingerprints yes but they on two different hands you I you know I like it that way because it's my body so we're talking about a body to be built for God to live in and then in doing that then we want to see what the word says about us that's right all right now we spent 40 years preaching I'm that's little over 40 you know since the prophet has passed on preaching about the things I think it's about time we begin to realize who we are the prophet of God said when the bride realizes who she is that's right and what her purposes of being here that Satan will be powerless I in the church at his book did he be powerless before us well it's about time to wake up to reality and start accepting What God Says yes you know that God says I'm perfect I might not agree with him you probably wouldn't agree with me about me that ain't got nothing to do with it I didn't have anything to do what God says God says I'm perfect all right now you argue with him about it but you know that's what we're supposed to believe right yeah but Brother D you still do wrong sure we do CU we're human sure we make mistakes but yet God says I'm perfect when are we going to start saying what he said now let's get on to what we were trying to say this morning and you forgive me for being a little cepy because I preach of the morning I get pretty fast and in the evening I have to talk slower okay so maybe the slower talk is easier for you that especially uh just you know kind of know a little bit about the human language of of what we Americans use the reason I say that is we're Southern and it's hard to interpret any of these brothers that would get up here and try to interpret what I say would be a problem because you're taught to say there over there and all of these proper words and and I'm just playing in southern this can be and I just say oh and that's hard to interpret but I know in your language you have word you know have people who talk we used to have a man that come down at Terrance and it worked for him and his name was pops and old pops he'd come down to work a little bit around the house and they' send somebody down to interpret but nobody couldn't interpret pops cuz they said he had his own Spanish language nobody could interpret pops so we've done a lot of sign language I'd say well we got the point you know we know how the language of the land is but forgive me and if you want to know what I said ask somebody else punch someone next to him what did he say all right no no joking just ta is true but now listen we got into this morning talking about how that as I said now let's go on to Perfection because we're not supposed to just stay in one place we're supposed to move on the Bible calls it growing in Grace and knowledge okay now this prophet's message never changed anything that had been brought by the apostles and Prophets because they brought the pure unadulterated word right all right but what he had to do was was to tell you and I that what it said right so as I said you know we've been told to stay out of the Book of Revelations because we can't understand it you know all right that was a faithful saying back in organized religion you can't understand this you can't understand that well now since the prophet came to bring us the message to tell us the symbols to tell them the tell us the things that was said why can't we understand right you know the one thing we need to understand with we need to baptism of the Holy Ghost but no man can call Jesus the Christ that's right except it be by the Holy Ghost right all right so that's what we need see we try to interpret it without the spirit of God right and we got man's ideas right oh man you're talking about getting into it you find a good Baptist that's where I came from I'm not thring off nobody but basic Baptist Doctrine is one God but now you ask him what he believes he'll tell you basic Baptist Doctrine is one God you say okay now explain that cuz that's what I done [Music] see they say God in three persons Blessed Trinity coequal and coeternal that was our explanation of the word of God the Bible never said that it never did talk about that that was what we interpreted and took our gles to read with to get our understanding but it never taught that right well I can read it to you right here he said but that wasn't what the Bible was saying the great Apostle Paul never in no way ever taught a Trinity right cuz the word wouldn't even there and the doctrines wasn't even back there in the church at the time of Paul I the Trinity you come along at 3:25 ad right but Paul said the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ 1 2 3 4 5 now he he didn't say what we thought he said right he was talking about the same person we're going to get to it in a minute if I don't get there I'll ask you to read uh Revelations U verse 4 not read it now if we get there we will verse 4-7 and look how many ands and and and and and and and and and there only one person right right and we believe in many man manifestations of God there is where the Prophet brought to us to understanding amen we believe in the father Son and the Holy Ghost but not as three Gods right not as God in three persons but is God made manifest in many forms I just got do with a series on the uh seven compound names of Jehovah he was Jehovah Gyra Jehovah dis Jehovah Shar the seven was all one God now he's no greater to be Jehovah Gyra than he is to be Jehovah RFI we make him greater in one way or the other it's not true God is the same see then that way we see the one true and living God and that's the Revelation for this day is God to be revealed that's why God had to send a prophet that's right now what I want to talk about this afternoon is what I was mentioning this morning the title of the message is words of this prophecy because that's what John says this whole Bible is a prophecy right now there's a lot in this Bible that is not necessarily just verbatimly say prophecy there's a lot in this Bible That's History right history book A lot of it in here doesn't need interpreting because it says it right now brother random didn't have to come and tell us that the seven golden candlesticks you know and the Seven Stars he didn't have to tell us what that was that's right it says it in the Bible so there are things if you go back in the Old Testament you'll find this written there are things in the Bible that was sealed and there are things that was not sealed right you remember that and they put it in an Earthly vessel some was sealed some wouldn't seal why because some didn't have to be sealed right now but those things that are sealed the scripture says the secret things belong unto God right but those things that he reveal belong unto his children all right so that's what I want is what I want watch mine that's right I'm kind of a selfish person in one thing if you got a banana pudding don't set it down if you don't want a hole in it cuz I want mine I love banana pudding but now what I want to talk about a little bit and forgive me brother Samuel you interpret this to your people especially to where they won't misunderstand not necessarily now but when you later well they won't misunderstand my language cuz I only have a seventh grade education or ninth grade and it's not worth anything anyway but I want to talk about how that God limited himself that's right now the word limit comes from a thing of saying like a you confine it within a limit you can find it within a area all right so now God for you and I to be able to understand him when Christ The Mystery of God revealed read around and said how could the god that covered all space and time and eternity be comprehended by mankind but you know what he's done it am he's revealed himself right it's took him 6,000 years to bring it to the basis that you and I can understand about God right a life being that he would send a prophet to make sure we didn't get it messed uph now the Old Testament was so important you know we used to say well it's not important there all we need is the New Testament you the Old Testament was so important until God came himself to back up what those prophets said brother randam own the message called Masterpiece he talks about Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph building a foundation and he said then the prophets built the body well you take one of those little guys like non and you say ah non just a minor Prophet you take him out of the Bible Jesus's body is not complete am right but see you take any of us out and the body of Christ is not complete okay now that's what I'm getting at see not just back there but they buil the body John the Baptist being the last one to come to introduce Jesus Christ to the world so it shouldn't be very odd to realize and see that Elijah was to come in this day and introduce amen Jesus Christ the word amen to you and I am right right so it's not something that we're playing around with something that we don't understand no it's been Vindicated brought to reality all right now that's what I'm talking about is revealing that God to you and I now in doing it then look what it says in Revelations 1:1 there the revelation what of Jesus Christ now this Revelation is about Jesus Christ right all right now just read the Bible in plain language read it read it just like you're looking at it and like it's talking to you like I've always tried to illustrate to people you know that the theologians has read the Bible but they couldn't figure out the serpent seed for nothing in the world right even though it says in the garden that there was just Adam and Eve and here comes two children one of them's a real good the other one just like his daddy see science can't find that missing Le Darwin couldn't never find it you kids in school you know what I'm talk about the theory of Darwin how we're all linked and real you know but they can't get across from the monkey to the man right but if they read the Bible right they would find the Beast right but now here's my point we done it as well as the theologians done it we read the book but we didn't read what it said we read what we thought it said right but you can go take a newspaper you take a newspaper article you go home this evening you pick up your newspaper and right on the front page of the newspaper it says it was one man and one woman on an island right and there was a beast there and all at once something happens and you get a messed up generation of people well you know there's hardly anybody that wouldn't read that and say o we know what happened oh my that woman had something to do with that Beast just because we'd read it and they laugh at us and say we're not spiritual for believing what this said right this tells the truth truth tell where we come from where we're going that's why the devil don't want you to read the book of Revelation because the Book of Revelation shows his beginning and it shows his ending so you don't want you know us to know that your old boy be better off if he'd take a couple of thousand years vacation and leave us alone amen but instead of that he keeps pounding on us right you know what he does he makes a Christian dig deeper right don't you want to know what's going on but you see he said to revelation of Jesus Christ Now read it there with me the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him him now who did God give the Revelation to Jus Jesus Christ what was the Revelation about it was about Jesus Christ right that's what it says this wasn't a revelation now watch me and don't misunderstand me this wasn't a revelation of God no it was revelation of Jesus Christ right but this Revelation going to prove that he was God Amen not the oness now this real TR the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him as we were talking about this morning Jesus he didn't know all things now make sure brother Samuel you interpret that one cuz people can misunderstand that one real good Jesus didn't know when he's coming right right amen he didn't know when he's coming right right but he said he didn't right he said I do nothing until the father shows me everybody understand why was it that Jesus we believe to be God but why was it he didn't know all things good question is it we'll read it after a while but the prophet of God he said you got the Holy Ghost in you say but you don't know everything why is it you don't know everything very simple questions I love questions I I love for people to think you know a lot of preachers and that's fine they like you get all geared up with them and get to shout and Glory Hallelujah but I've sitting a many a congregation and heard people hollering amen amen and I sitting there no that ain't right that ain't right that ain't right my amen was H me because it wasn't right you get so built up until you just amen amen amen and that's all right now forgive me now if I offend you but I like for you to think about what I say right I never read in the bible where jesus shouted all over the place now come on you show it to me show me where Paul never got up shouted all all over the place now he preached all night long he preached so long till the boy fell out of the window and got killed but you know what he must have had some pretty good Goods cuz he went down and raised him up that's right I get my time to shouting when I'm out in the woods by myself and I'm listening to the prophet on my little MP3 player thing in my pocket you know iPod but see I I like to think about things I like for you to think about it so what is that guy saying then I tell you what I'm saying and then you can make up your mind whether you believe it or not okay but now you know Jesus there the greatest anointing he said brother so I no no come on but the Bible says in that Jesus the prophet says it was the anointed and yet he simply read a scroll turned around and sat down and said this day this scripture fulfilled now I remember when I first saw that I shouted because I saw that he saw something about himself right he said well how could he be God I don't understand y'all folks we had the Trinity all figured out the father was up in heaven and the Holy Ghost was running up and down and keeping us doing this that and the other and the sun was within us so we had all this and we had forgive me secretaries some of them called them priests and nuns and and some of them called them preachers and he wanted something to try to explain to them what is going on well oh that's wonderful but what do God say right now there was a revelation that had to be given and it was a revelation of Jesus Christ and it was something Jesus didn't understand right I'll be glad to give you this is in the church AG book it's about page 12 that Jesus didn't understand his part in the kingdom when he was here you know they ask him will you restore to you know to the kingdom to Israel he said you don't understand you know what he didn't understand we'll get back to that in a minute but I want to prove the point to you make sure you understand so he didn't understand but the prophet of God said when he come here to patmas read it the church when he come to patmas then he understood that that he didn't understand when he was here on Earth and then he could tell the the even the future church and what it would be doing and what would take place okay am but how is it that he could be God and not know all things that's our problem we try to figure that out with our brain right you can't do it that's one of the things you got to believe well I just can't believe that Jesus didn't know everything well he said he didn't your Prophet said he didn't so now you're going to argue with him I going to argue with you so what happened now as I said this morning in ending the message the Christ of the Old Testament he knew all things right right right cuz that was almighty God Amen he knew all things he was not limited in any way right that's right because he was almighty God but because of the fall of Man now I told you I don't have no education so just forgive me but just think some way God God made a way cuz we couldn't do it some way he made a way that when he would come into flesh that he would limit himself right to where he wouldn't know all time right now to try to express that in a way you know the story of the called the bumper blood how that when man sinned in the garden that God took the animals he killed those animals he made skins and he put them on Adam and Eve right and he made then what would be known as a bumper blood to cover the whole world that's why your Prophet would say then it being read he said you look through red at Red you'll see white so that way in the Old Testament he wouldn't destroy mankind yet they would sin like everything right 10 times the Bible said the children of Israel sinned against God from the time they left Egypt till they got to cadis barnia 10 times sure he whpt them J he punished them but they were still going to the promised land but when they would not believe Joshua and Caleb's report that they could take that land God could not Overlook that because that was unbelief by their unbelief they were turned back to the Wilderness until all that was 20 years of age and over died in the wilderness because of their unbelief heaven have we don't want to disbelieve God see there was no limit he was there he could do the great things he could park the water in front of the children of Israel he could rain Quail down out of the sky to feed them he could be as we were talking about Jehovah Gyra the Lord's provided sacrifice to Jehovah RFA like the Healer brother R said one day he said Moses had two and a half million people not one doctor in the whole crowd you need one so you want to look into Moses Dr saxel you know what I mean the little black bag the doct carish do you want to look in his satel say I am the Lord that Health all of thy diseases there no limit to God there but the bumper blood protected the people amen thank God that buffer of blood is still here amen but it changed at Calvary go to became the blood of Jesus Christ but you see God knew he couldn't send a son he couldn't send a prophet right he couldn't send somebody else right to die for sins he wouldn't be just would you send one of your children as the prophet would say to die when you're the one supposed to die so what did he do he came himself the great Eternal God that covered all Space and Time and Eternity came down the prophet said it like this bottled himself up into the wound of a a Virgin Mary to bring a body he said there was little Jehovah crying in the Cradle my Bible says Emmanuel which is God With Us right with another God another person he didn't he wasn't one person that sent another one now here's the words of the prophet he said I don't believe in no second person no third person second person he said matter of fact don't even believe in the first person that's right cuz he said he was the person because there a first person then that means they could be another person he didn't believe him I don't believe him I believe God condescended to humanity amen he come down into that human body and when that little body was delivered from the the Virgin Mary the Soul and Spirit of almighty God came into that body right huh what happens to you when you're born amen mama and daddy supplies the body right God gave you a soul and a spirit the make you a human being make you a person so Jesus come the same way now have them if you'd like them I've read it to you so many times but brother brand said in body he was a man but said in Soul he was God Amen and he said in body he was a man but said in spirit he was God right so what was the Virgin birth it brought the body right It produced Hebrews 10:5 a body thou Hast prepared me right amen we see once he stepped into that body D is where the limitation came because in that body he would be limited right amen now you've heard it over and over from the prophet so it's good enough when he was dwelling in that body he couldn't be all over the world at one time right right is that true he can only be in one body but he said Greater Works can you do now not greater like we can do something different than what he done but what does it mean the original says more Works can we do then he done that's what Jesus said why because around the world now you have the body of Christ God can be all over the world today living in individual people whereas then he was in one body right am well C you understand in the godhead right the Bible says that in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily right right so then it's simple to say God just condescended dropped right down come right out of that virgin created a body stepped right out when he did he stepped right in Soul and Spirit and there was almighty God now there's some doctrines in the land today that some of you probably had heard of but there's great Doctrine in the land among the people of the message that says that Jesus wasn't god Till The River Jordan the anointing came on him and made him God well according to my Bible Bible said unto you this day in the city of David is a savior which is Christ the lord right his name Shall be Called Emmanuel which is God With Us your Prophet said little Jehovah crying in the Cradle little Jehovah playing as a boy little Jehovah coming out the adoption time he come to those things that was little Jehovah now but you see if you just had Jesus being a man and then God steps in him and then he steps back out of him because you got to admit something happen right see then where did Jesus go now according to my Bible that's why I love to read the Bible I believe this Prophet turned us back to the Bible he didn't turn us away from the Bible he turned us back to the Bible all right then according to my Bible are on Calvary he yielded up the ghost that's right right into thy hands I commend my spirit right yet the prophet of God will make outstanding statements which are true he said the anointing left Jesus in the garden said because he couldn't die like that you say God can't die you're okay if you're dealing with Spirit realm right when that God was in that human flesh that's why he was never called a Son of God show me he was always called son of man that's right who a man say I the son of man am why cuz it was a son of man that died right son of man was word made flesh Son of God was the spirit right that's why down to the church ages you don't deal with son of man Paul never even taught the son of man none of the disciples in their writings Peter didn't WR of the son of man cuz he didn't understand even though Jesus stood right there to Peter and said who the man say I the son of man am right he said th art the Christ right the son of the Living God right what did Jesus say Flesh and Blood didn't reveal that unto thee but my Father revealed it and on that rock I'll build my church other words you don't know what I ask I ask you about the son of man you refer to me as the son of God that's who I am but someday I'll come back in the end time as son of man that's right in the Bride of Jesus Christ amen cuz brother Brandon wasn't the son of man that's right brother Brandon was a son of man that's right come on I'm quoting brother random out of the church age book brother randam wasn't the son of man the son of man is the Lord Jesus Christ but he had the ministry of the son of man that's how close it was but you make him de son of man you make him Dey then you got a problem but see limited himself by coming into flesh cuz I asked a question a moment ago you have the new birth you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you have the new birth you got to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost right you have the life of God living in you right I come you don't know everything why is it you don't know everything because you got a body and a spirit that in a worldly Earthly realm right and we're controlled by that whether you like it or not right there's not too many of us real skinny maybe a few but most of us are pretty fat so you know what's happening the world is controlling me come on right flesh controls us we must live in this realm and to do that there must be a spirit within us to motivate us and you're not born again in your spirit you're not born again in your body you can only be born again in your soul that's why the body has to be changed not get a new one now don't believe in that amen believe is his body redeemed that's right I know how say it one thing when Jesus raised he had nail prints in his so it must have been the same body it raised back up he still had the nail prints that's right but now listen but while he was here in this world he had to eat sure I know he could go 40 days and you and I can't do it don't try it now remember where was that for one thing but you can't go you can go without food for a long time but you can't go without water you got to have water in about 3 or 4 days that's in this climate we were in Israel walking the deserts and you know what they told us keep a bottle of water in your hand and drinking at all times because I remember sometime they said you have to consume in that environment you must consume between two and three gallons of water a day to keep you from dehydrating right and remember he was out in the desert without water or food so you can't do that that's proved who that was nobody I don't care you say brother so and so fasted so many days did he drank water then you find out they put a little Coke in their liquid and then you find out he was sneaking down to McDonald's every once in a while getting a hamburger while nobody wouldn't watch him he buys him some pants about four sizes too big and he walks around and everybody look at him fasting oh that's a hypocrite that's just the best way to say it that's what it is that's what Jesus called him but now get my point my being in human flesh does everybody understand me being in human flesh limited because Satan could talk to Jesus you agree he did in the Temptation take these Stones make them bread take this to that take this to that he talked to him and your Prophet said that Jesus could even be tempted the Bible said in all points as we are your Prophet said he could be tempted by women you might not like that statement but it's true what he said now he didn't go out with his tongue Led Out l y night for everybody went by no there's nothing wrong with being tempted is when you yield yourself to the Temptation there is where you messed up when you entertain the thought you can't help the thought coming Satan could talk to Jesus tried to make deals with him you know what he even said to him ever thought about he said you do all these things I'll give you these kingdoms well you know what Jesus knew he was going to have to die to get him that's right right he knew he'd have to die to get him wouldn't it been easy say hey hand him over buddy I'm just on your side a little bit no he wouldn't on his side none whatsoever he said I'll go pay the price and he did but you understand how that God is the only one that could limit now how it how is that God can't see your sins now don't tell me he don't know you s don't sin I mean sin don't tell me that now I didn't say that he knows what you're doing but you know brother Rand made a statement one time was outstanding to me somebody said something to him about in the prayer line you know at times brother Brown especially his early Ministry he called it out he said you're living with this man's wife you're doing this you're doing wrong he said God told him not to use it that way he stopped doing it unless it was really just God bearing down on him cuz he said you cause marriage and divorces you cause lawsuits killings and everything else but you know what he said one day somebody asked him something he said listen if that person has repented of that sin I can't bring it up now there's God not in that man or brother around now amen when God covers your sin the scripture say it's in the seal forgetfulness as far as East and West now you go north and south going to reach a pole you go east and west you just come back back around start back over you just that's why it says east and west cuz you can't find no stopping part right and like the man said you know he found out his sins was in the depth of the sea he said I read the other day where they can't even find the bottom in some of the places is that means my sins is still going but you understand God limits himself to keep from having destroy me and you that's right oh don't think you're so good now don't ever get the idea that you're so goody goody that God don't he loves you so much you can do anything you want to do you better be careful how you walk because God can pull a limit off anytime he wants to he can cover us but he can pull it off too right but you understand God limited himself I remember one time I preached a little message on you ever thought about a god having Amnesia you better interpret that to the brother I hope he catches that no it don't bother me for you to tell him what I'm saying you know what amnesia is Right Amnesia means your mind's blocked out you don't remember well I go do something wrong and I go before God and I say God forgive me he said I don't remember it the devil says he done it the whole congregation says he done it amen God said I didn't see it now if you think that ain't right you go over o baam you remember bam and B you remember bam o ba paid him to curse Israel they were time he' go down and try to curse Israel he couldn't curse them he blessed them he said hey come around here to let me show you the worst things it's called hinder Parts in the Bible you know what that means it's it doesn't mean this back it means the worst thing you can do you know we said come around here let me show you all these bad things they doing he said I can't see anything he said because there's a sh of the king in the camp that's wonderful God isn't it you know one of these days I'm going to thank you and say God thank you for forgetting hey come on don't you think you're guilty guilty of the least guilty of the whole but just think about it now trying to get the point across when you get down to verse we won't get that far to say it but when you get down to verse 11 in Revelations 1 verse 10 said I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying that's in red letter then because it would show Jesus right I'm Alpha and Omega the beginning end and all what you see here's what brother Bram said on the message patas Vision 1960 paragraph 143 he said before we go any further and I say anymore I want you to know who I am now that's what he wanted John to know that John before I start revealing any other things I want you to know who I am what about a wonderful God a God that would want us to know who he is a God that would so love us that he wants us to know I'm not a theologian in all no way but I sure do like to read what some of them say about those big old words that we use sometime you know I mean we're we're people in especially in America we we know all about theophanes we used to we didn't know what the word theophany was right till the prophet came right and we knew all about Elohim self-existing Jehovah Jehovah je we can just keep going going why because we've been trained but you know all of that is revealing God right all of that can be said about that little fell running down they playing what about Jehovah God just playing what about him growing up and becoming a little boy you know children he is to each one of us what we are so no matter how young you are God is to you and he can understand you he understands what it is used to be a little boy now brother bradam said see people don't think brother Bram was human most of the time but he said one day he either read a book or something I forgot which way saw a movie or read a book about Tarson he went in the house and got his mother's rug he cut it up and he made him a suit and he started doing the Superman's and the thing and he started swinging through the trees he started cuz he was a boy I get so tickled at him when I hear him because see I'm 70 years old and I was raised in the country right most of you don't even know nothing about what he's talking about I don't mean that wrong I just mean you didn't come up like that you remember him telling about how that he had his cover his overalls pulled over and just had one strap and he had a nail sticking through it oh brother Thomas back there laughing CU see we used to come through some of that you know when that button got broke off you either tied a knot and tied it in your over halls or you just take you a nail and you just stick it through and you slide that nail in there right amen he said he got ready to go in swimming said he just started running toward the water and he just pulled a nail he said the clothes was left in midair and he was diving into the water well you don't know that see but I do you know cuz we was kids but now listen here's my point I'll quit on you know I believe Jesus was a little boy that's right you know if he'd been in the days when Taren was jumping out of the tree hard a you know swinging on vines you know what Jesus would have done he swung on Vines he was a boy am you don't ever think about that you don't ever think about how that he was a teenager amen you teenagers running I know what you think you think us grown up don't know a thing right I don't care where you're Hispanic or where you whatever y'all call yourself cuz I know you get in trouble saying that a lot of times because one groups wants you to call them Hispanics other wants to call you Mexican other wants you to call you this and I just don't know which one to call you okay so I just stay Hispanic I went to Brazil and come find out they was they were speaking Portuguese excuse me well I didn't understand a lot of it but you know what I understood most of it I told him I said want some AA they'll get mad at you for saying the Portuguese will for saying they are speaking Spanish but you know what they got me some more water but the thing of what I'm getting at listen I want you to see one thing just forget all the other Jesus lived as a human being right upon this Earth You know he had to take a bath you know he had to eat come on I mean his toenails need cutting too you see I'm just trying to make him down to where you can understand my whole point how that God limited himself by coming in living that way Amen brother BR said he sat on a rock grown with a headache taking it from uh what is it Prince of the House of David he said he sat on the Rock and grown with a headache after raising that little boy from the dead you know he was sick but Brother D say I was a Baptist okay one God that's what I told about ho ghost God in threee person Blessed Trinity but still one God I believe he was so much God when I was in the Baptist Church that he couldn't stomp his toe and hurt himself I don't mind telling you that's the way I believed it I believed he was God so he couldn't be hurt I believe my God couldn't get hurt I believe my God didn't die but then when I come in the message I found a lot of difference right you say what happened at Calvary brother randam unveiling of God get the message unveiling of God brother Randon said he only acted the part of death amen you know what happened to Calvary I could go back to brother collie of ill it many times I could cut his head to slap off of him you know I can't kill him you said no you just killed him no I can't CU God want me put the head back on right see God's the only one who can take our lives so what happens when you die what happens when you die your soul and your spirit leads out of the body agree everybody understand your soul your spirit goes out of the body the body rotten sure they got to get an Undertaker pretty quick well what happened on Calvary amen right God just removed himself out of that body right amen and let that body hang on Calvary but what happened a few days later amen that same God Condes ascended amen because that soul that was in that man we call Jesus went to hell to preach to those spirits that was in prison that's right the spirit was released and come back and come back pick the soul up the prophet said and step right back into that body and raised it right out of the ground amen now you tell me that wasn't almighty God but you tell me that's Oneness I tell you wrong that's right amen that's not oness Doctrine right oness Doctrine is one like your finger that's right in other words that's the only manifestation of God that's right that's one this doctor I talk to him and give him the tea That's the only manifestation of God that's why I wiggle my finger see they believe he was Jehovah the old Jesus is the new they don't understand the Holy Ghost now cuz they can't figure it out talk to oness amen wouldn't like your finger they believe Jesus was the last form of God I differ Amen on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost came into the bride of Christ amen you and I are God in another form amen we're not another God we are the children of God Amen by the new birth we're his offspring right all their on what in act 19 what is it when he went up there to where there you know to the unknown Gods he said that's one I like to talk to you about amen he said you called you and your Doctrine called the the family of God children of God and he said that's what we are amen we're his offspring God by the new birth had done a mysterious thing that's right Amen to come and now live in me and you amen where's the teacher at why your Bible says it now come on we know the truth right the said no man you need no man teach you right cuz the Holy Ghost is in you right now come on put it together right the prophet of God said then why did God put teachers in the body he said CA that teacher in the body to bring you the word amen that's it but that teacher is really in you hallelujah amen amen Paul said the life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God the new birth amen makes us the children of God and anytime you can't figure out how that God could know anything and live in a human flesh just think about yourself right and say well I don't know everything and I must grow in Grace and knowledge amen thank God he limited himself to where he could come and live because what would he have been if he had not have come that way and where would you and I be today thank God for these things Brother Sam would you
