our daily bread forgive us of our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against this lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil what a prayer for thine is the glory for ever and ever Lord amen and when he had opened the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven about the space of a half an hour now let's read John 19:30 I'm going to continue reading this one then maybe it will it'll strike home that this is kind of what we're talking about is we were talking last Sunday about the shout when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished anybody's head gave up the ghost let's read the last one Ephesians 4:30 and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading the word now as we have been through going through the seals we find out that Steele had a symbol each seal had a a seen each seal had a part each seal we've been through it for a year we've been through the first seal second seal third seal fourth seal fifth seal sixth seal and now into the seventh seal where now we come up to a time where there's no symbol there's no motion there's no voice there's no it's just silence in heaven for the space of a half of an hour and as I said before I could bring the drawing board up here but I you can't write anything on it according to what the Bible says there was silence in heaven for the space of a half an hour so you're gonna have to just leave that blank because there was no symbol there was no movement brother Brown said there was no movement because one move would give away the secret all right so we got us then we got to do something as I was telling them downstairs this morning what's come to me on this seventh seal is that if we look at the first seal and that pertains to you and I in the spiritual form right we look at the second seal it pertains to you a night of spiritual form right third fourth fifth sixth all the way up now we've come to the seventh seal and then what have we done what have we done we've made it brother branham's got to come back we've made it it ain't open somebody's got to come and open it we've made it I say we not us but I mean the message people have made it everything they've made it the cloud they've made it they've made it the seventh under virtues were seven men with seven voices have gotten they're all dead so they're not doing us any good I mean really come on so they've made it everything but what it is and it's what's just what I read you if there's only one seal and the seventh seal is the completion remember that's God's complete number is seven then what and where is that seventh seal it's not in heaven it's not a denomination it's not a car or a boat or a cloud sure those were symbols those were things that that helped us along that helped us to to get clarity about what was going on but they made it everything in the world but the only thing that it is its Christ in you the hope of glory the seventh seal is not one person it is the bride now sure you say well what you take Christ that well Christ is one person but he's a mini membered body I mean where in the world why would you have a shout with nobody to hear what's going on I would why would you have a voice if there was no no contact I mean you know laughing come on people God told us one time remember he said well it was me said the the most intelligent conversation he ever has is with itself right I agree with that so but it's kind of boring to have a conversation with yourself have you ever argued with yourself much it's much better to argue with somebody else though right okay so you got in other words it takes it takes to you got to have a voice and then you got to have somebody to respond to that voice negative or positive either way all right same way with here in speaking we must have we must have something that said so that there can be a response so it's looking at this seventh seal people have made it everything in the world but what it is it's Christ living in a bride doing the same things he did when he was here the first time that's just about the simplest thing I can say to you because if seal 1 through 6 was the plan of redemption sealed 7 can't be something way part away from that it's got to be the completion of that same plan because you started with one church age and you get the seven church ages completes the Gentile journey there Paul says the mystery of the Gentiles we'll read it a little bit later where he says the mystery of the Gentiles there in Colossians which is Christ in you the hope of glory the problem is as we have many times that I'm going to keep saying they keep saying it is that we got Christ over here and us over here you said no he's drilling inside here but you still got to people they can't be evil one person living there and you said one nice God used together this person I thought that word vulcanized vulcanized means that whatever the material was it slept up against the material that same exact material and it intertwines so well till there's no way you can pull it apart and I'm telling you that's what the plan of redemption is it's not that God come down and he purified your soul and then he went off somewhere and sent you a second person or sent you a third person it's him it's that same guy it's that same man that walks the shores of Galilee so we must keep that because remember - and like we were talking about before about people and I say some people probably in in the message the reason they they preach the way they do about redemption of the body they just don't think there's enough redemption in this message for that why I promise you one thing if the seals do not open in a supernatural way - you sitting here today sitting here today I'm gonna tell my somebody off somewhere else I'm no my today if the seals are not open to you in the same form that we're bringing it to you then it's a mystery to you that don't make you the mystery that makes it a mystery to you and you will say how can this word change my mortal body that will be a question in your mind that has been a question all the way down to the church ages because remember the prophet of God tells us he says they got the baptism of the Holy Ghost but they couldn't get completely pulled apart from what from a denominational idea we were talking about some things last night a lot of things that you hear in denomination is tradition you say well the Catholic Church does that well that's mama her daughters are just doing what she's doing they're taking the tradition that mom was walking on the streets to go right now she's in glory with Jesus well that's not true and that hell is eternal and we were talking about suicide last night the different things you know you thank God for a prophet but if we if we would have looked in the Bible we would have seen that saw of course all of them go to the stall about Saul killed itself and and he's you know everybody that have you ever been anywhere where somebody like specially a Baptist does a funeral and the person commits suicide man they just stumble all over themselves they don't know how to handle it because their tradition tells them that there is no way that person is going to heaven he was not a Christian he's going to help when we know that's exactly false brother Branham tells us is false but you know what the Bible tells us that it's false because they always go back to solve number one Saul didn't kill herself he tried but brother Bram tried to kill this there applies but Saul tried to kill itself the little boy came by and killed him but if Saul was in hell Samuel was in hell the prophet Samuel was brought up the day before from paradise and he told Saul to Det tomorrow you'll be with me so whoever samuel was that's where Saul's going to make a very very real point you and I are gonna see Saul in glory you and I are going to see God's anointed Saul was one of God's anointed prophets now that's according to the Bible and according to what David said David said don't you touch that man because look David could have killed him several times several times he could have killed him and he didn't but see that but you see you hear that long enough and what I'm saying about people the message you hear it long enough that there's not enough redemption for this body and we we got to wait number one they waited gonna everybody falls back home we gotta wait till somebody comes back and speaks us in your body that's that's basically your 10th doctrine is that brother barons got to come back and speak to the glorified body well I don't see that I don't agree with that and I'm promising you a tingle happen if we don't get what he's already said and become that now I don't care if Jesus himself brings a tent and puts it out here if you're not ready you're not gonna go you're not gonna be there so we got to get ready now lazy people wait on other stuff we can't wait on this we and we can't we can't force this thing but you know what we can get right in rhythm remember the bride the bride the review of the bride brother Brown said they were all in rhythm and he said they've started to get out of step now it did not make him it didn't make him nan bride they were just getting out of step and he said get back in line what that voice came from where he was to them get back in line remember and then he came back into this dimension so that's what he was telling but get back in line what listen to good preachers and good teachers and good good Sunday School teachers and all the different things I was thinking this morning man how fortunate we are but how unfortunate a lot of people are that have to sit under things like that I mean how would you be sitting in a message church and you're sitting there for years and the preacher just says there's not enough redemption for your body well where are your words your mind going to go where is your where is your hope and your aspiration of of even I wouldn't even study I just say I got the Holy Ghost and I'm in the message Church and I just believe God sent a prophet don't cut my hair welcome me cut my hair but don't put on makeup and all these different things you know and you just sit there and run down around in your brain for 40 years that's why we're still here it's just sitting there running do's and dont's around and I'm right but they've not studied they've not had somebody to teach them that this is the total plan of redemption brother Branham let me let me just read this don't bring it up tell them or read it again cuz I'm getting little head of myself but listen something bout the shouting these different things I'll find it just take it well you know what I'll start the message and then we'll get to it but brother Brian was talking about he said it's not in the years of preparation it's not in the healing campaign you've heard that many times before it's not that wasn't a brother I want the prophets message these seals were his message so if you want to get the prophets message you got to hear these seals if you want to hear what our prophet was our prophet was not sent to us to help us live better lives that was taught from Pentecost all the different ones I mean come on when you come up to John Wesley where you know even drinking tea was was was had no value so he said don't let's don't do it because then he come under that part of sanctification now but now Luther could Luther could drink a beer and smoke a pipe but now Wesley didn't so you see God moving up further bringing more revelation then you got the Pentecostals which took it to the other extreme and made them wear long sleeves and no jewelry and they just went over to the other side but there's always a middle of the road and that's what brother Branham he come and brought them back to the faith of the fathers restored back what the gifts and all those things and then he brought his message in 1963 64 and 65 and that was the message that he was to bring and that's our message I mean really we should have been living right a good Christian life if you were a Christian before you heard of the message if you were a Christian before you heard the message you should have been living that Christian life because this message doesn't make you a Christian if you're a Christian you believe this message I was telling them downstairs and I'll tell you too while we're all here of course the ones that are not here is not going to hear it but where is our zeal if you don't know anymore today than you knew 10 years ago if you're just coming to church and I believe in and you know like I said somebody else already made Church a 1 a 1 shot deal on Sunday anyway so brother Brown said you can't wait for the doors of this church to open to get in here not not to and how many of you say all at Sunday I got set to hold outside to go to church she has never been part of my my lord and mom and dad and we were we went to church from we were Baptist both services and on Wednesday night the Bible says much more as the day approaches you should be gathered together in the sanctuary in church so what are we doing we're trying to we're trying to get this big great Seventh Seal brought to us and and we can't even be here to hear it so you know it and I'm glad you know brother Dale's brother that was hitting me you got to be born again being born again so you say well no I've been born in 40 years I'm he's talking to them young people well you better be able to get you a little bit while you at it because it's it's lamp trimming time it's sharpening up time it's time for us to maybe get back in the furrow and plant the right you know the seat right seeds being planted it's just you and I got to take what irrigate it we got a water washing of the water by the word all right so much more as the day approaches we see more people falling away but we see the ones that are here that the ones that are now here they're solid they're getting more solid getting more solid getting more solid because listen this is the great shaking time when these seals open brother Branham said at the end of the seventh seal he said thousands of my friends will leave right why because he's bringing the message that nobody understood thousands of my friends he had to stand alone and then my Lord when he preached marriage and divorce I think he said he might have said hundreds he said thousands when he started preaching marriage in divorce so you see that what the word does the word is a divider and a separator it will divide whether you like it or not so the holy ghost remember the holy ghost is the only revealer of the word so you should know more not just by letter but this thing should come the essence we were talking about this a little bit this past week the essence of the message is what we're not getting the essence is not quotes because you can stand up here and and and I can take quotes and I make all two lords and I make I make a polygamy and well I mean the Bible is the same way but if you get the essence of this message you'll be here every Sunday you'll be here every time the door is open and you'll not just be here because somebody said you need to be here you'll be here because you want to be here that's the difference it's being here because you have a desire to be here if you have no desire to be here then but that's who brother tells all about people that ain't got in your birth if you don't have a desire to be here you don't have the new birth I'm just gonna make it that plain you just are not born of the Spirit of God you might have an anointing every once in a while but you are not born of the Spirit of God if you don't believe if you don't like coming to church and listening to what God has to say even though it may be a boring me doesn't matter it's what the word says the word says for us to assemble ourselves together the word said he didn't say now see then well here we go with this laundry list well I've got this and I've got that sure I love to take vacations you love to take vacation if you take a vacation on Sunday that's fine but just just to be out because you can't sit what was the old saying you got diarrhea gots got diarrhea stay home with it know if it counts got diarrhea you put it up somewhere in you come on concern pray for it amen but let's get into this and quit but burnt but now why listen nice thing this other day we bring in this seventh seal in why why is everything coming full circle back around to the very beginning brother that was bringing back at the very beginning of justification sanctification to baptism the Holy Ghost because you know why because I've been bringing you the further of it now if you've got that inside of you you understand what I'm saying if you have listened to the voice not me but listen to what God has told you for the past year then when God comes back around and picks up here and brings you through it should be like that roman candle it should be like well that's one of that says that and that's why this is happening and that's why this is this way and that's why the scripture says what it does that's truly that will tell you if you're born again if you're just sitting here because you got sent a prophet and you like being here because of the person beside you then you need to do something else yeah brother Aaron but but Joe's not even looking at you leave me alone but really what have we come to do we assemble together to listen to what God has said and to bring the pieces of this puzzle together because why am I saying this the greatest mystery is that God is living in you the world can't see it they wonder why you act the way you do and if they don't wonder why the way that you act the way you do let's go back to being justified and being sanctified and being filled with the Holy Ghost because if the world can't tell you're different you got a problem because this world is so totally contrary to the new birth they don't even know how to get it okay if they don't know how to get it and you sit there you are the way you are and you do the things you that you do then you're going to be a ministry to them so there is your mystery which is Christ in you the hope of glory and not just Christ sitting in there not doing anything it's Christ in you doing the work as I've always said the reason come on people can you not when you read the Bible when you read the Bible but demand a very man that wrote the Bible supposed to be inside of you he's not locked down in your stomach he's looking through the same eyes you look through and he's looking back and that's why brother Branham said that he'll say the Holy Ghost will say amen to the word every you know why he'll say amen to the word cuz he's the one that wrote it I will say amen to everything that I said that's correct why because I'm the one who wrote it so the guy that wrote this is inside of you and you look down and see that and you something's got a quick and inside of if it doesn't then start at justification heart somewhere anybody all right but that's what the seals are to me it's the plan of redemption well what is the plan of redemption it's taking you from a sinner you don't go like this to God it's taking you from a sinner to God because you're gods and when God lives in you I got some quotes I was looking them up well when brother Louise called me out and look up joint-heir you look at what brother Brown said about join air goes join air if you're an air and you're enjoying there whatever Christ guess whatever Jesus Christ gets that's what you get amen that's why brother Graham says right here in Revelation the first first quote we read it last Sunday or Sunday before down it's a red-letter part he breaks the seals revealed gives us his inheritance to his people now what is our inheritance the opening of the seals that's my inheritance hey man you know I've got the new birth I've got that inheritance I've got eternal life I got part of the city I've got that future home inside of me but you know what I'm still in a journey because this thing's not redeemed yet this thing right here this flesh but he breaks the seals reveals gives us his inheritance to his people he gives the inheritance that he inherited becoming our kinsman redeemer and freely gives it out to us it all belong to him hey listen if he wanted to he could have walked out of that tomb well he wouldn't even have to come get on the cross but he could have walked out of the tomb took his glorified body and went right the glory and just stayed there but that was not his purpose his purpose is not to dwell alone his purpose is to have sons and daughters and the only way to have sons and daughters is to go back inside of them and genetically change that inside person to be the seed gene of God not the one that your mom and daddy brought now we still have to walk in this shell but he's fixing to have these he had his shell changed I'd like to read this right here to this brother freely gives it out it belonged to him he was the one who redeemed but instead of keeping it he gives it back to his people now what did Jesus Christ inherit he inherited eternal life in his body he did not have when he was a baby when he was 20 when he was 29 he did not have an eternal body his body was dead it was dying he was only 30 years old and he looked 50 all right but when he came out of that tomb that boy didn't look 50 anymore he turned back to that same one that said let there be light and he was that young 20 year old man and that was the inheritance he inherited and not keeping that inheritance he gave it back to me and you eternal life in the same body he walked on the earth will he walk till that tombs sure it had been changed sure it had been changed but it wasn't a different one when he resurrected that body laid dead in the tomb he got back in that same body people he got back in that same body and that be - II was not withheld he totally went from the inside and went just in the moment of 2009 he was young man again and those cells were firing on a different wavelength and it were before they were firing on an eternal wavelength and he didn't have to eat but he could he didn't have to drink but he could he could walk through that wall he didn't have to open the door to go through and that's the inheritance that you and I get and listen he didn't get it in another dimension he had to come back into this dimension to get that body so that's the same thing gonna happen to you if you pass away you've got to come from that dimension back into this dimension the go get that body connect with it and stand at a 20 year old eternal body not looking different but looking the same folks that's Redemption that's not replacement most people are preaching replacement but you can't see the open of these seals and see replacement you take the total picture and you see Redemption when you see these seals open amen instead of keeping it he gave it back to his people that's his love for us now look at number two in the briefs now when we go break these seals we're gonna see it goes plumb back to Scripture all the way back for each one of these seals the whole thing together the whole mystery lays right here in these seals all right let's don't go looking for a mr. anywhere else let's look for the mystery what in the seals for each one of these seals the whole thing together the whole mystery lays right here in these seals every mystery of the Bible lays in these seals and the seals cannot be broke until this time so it was all sealed up until what the time that was appointed for it to break amen notice now let's finish reading remember the book is sealed remember revelations 5 the book was sealed but now what in Revelations 10 here's one here's this seal then another one's wrapped another one's wrapped it's a book of redemption and the whole thing together makes the book and it's sealed with seven seals being on the backside kill just wound up the seal mystery is on the inside prove that to you by showing you the seal on the outside you can't see what's on the inside until the seals broke tell my Taurus riders from Genesis to Revelation is a complete plan of redemption now listen let me ask you a question and we're going to talk about this when we do the shout of the voice in them and the trumpet but I want to get you this in your mind a complete plan of redemption for a who our what ok a complete and plan for demson for what well it's gonna be the earth ok that's part of it but the complete plan of redemption is human beings that were born wrong that was born in sin shapen in iniquity it is the total plan to bring us back to the Garden of Eden condition before the fall now remember we're getting all this from Christ as the mystery of God revealed in brother Brian said if you miss it in the seals he said come to this message which is Christ as the mystery of God revealed now like I said before where is Christ now Christ is in you so that makes you part of the mystery a complete plan of redemption is revealed in these seven seals now a complete plan of redemption not partial man has got partial redemption since since the day of Pentecost they had partial redemption it wasn't time for their body to be redeemed but they had partial redemption because the inside man was redeemed but the rest of them was not and then God help us to get it all right let's read the next one number three now look what brother Brown said in the rising of the Sun he said the quickening power has come to us to open the seven seals what was it what was that the intelligence of a man no it was a man with seventh grade education preaching the greatest sermon he yielded itself so much - God - God spoke through that man and gave us the opening of those sealed right know the quickening power of God and as I said before the quickening power of God foretold this would take place now remember during that whole week of the open the seals there wasn't you know there were people being baptized in different things probably a few people being healed but what I'm what I'm saying is if that was the greatest thing you ever worked under it wasn't the healing campaign it wasn't the raising of the dead campaign it was the apex of the opening of the word campaign which is the quickening power of God now to have that quickening power of God you can do these other things but now remember a man anointed with the Holy Ghost can raise the dead and be just as black on the inside but we're talking about a man that was born again that was a prophet of God that yielded itself to God and that quickening power was speaking to me and you and it was not going through a denominational filter or going through even brother branham's own ideas because remember brother branham's own ideas were wrong when it come to the seals oh we hate that but I'm gonna route if you want me to pull it up I saw it the other day in in the sixth seal or seventh seal he said this is way beyond what I thought way beyond what I was thinking what man this prophets been on the scene for 40 years he said this is way past what I thought way past my own thinking first feel he was going back to his old nose to preach a wild horse rider was a was the mighty Conqueror which was totally wrong but God is never wrong we were talking about this morning where we were reading there in Hebrews what talks about immutability the immutability of God is unchangeable you got listen God can't even change his own word and that's what I like but now remember the Bible says two immutable things because when that immutability comes inside of you it makes you immutable Bremmer brother Bram said when to omnipotence meet listen God's not even God without you he's Elohim he's a he's not an object of worship here he was nothing before came along you say nothing yeah he was he was just self-existing he was LOM but the attributes and that's what I see now the more the more I see it now is that's why you and I are in the stage and the age that we're in right now he said well this is bad because it isn't so what God knew this is what was going to happen it's not a secret to God like brother Dale was saying that the man said we'll God didn't know if she's gonna die last night so he baptized her well you know God knew that before the foundation of the world if I'd have been there I just said dude God even you you's gonna say that before the ground a little girl right so the immutability of God but what we're looking at now is is we're looking at that transferred to me and you to omnipotence you got immutability you got in our human mind we can't be immutable we change all the time I've got stuff I got to do tomorrow and I'll guarantee you one of them 10 items is going to change but with God it's not and with God's Word if you become the Word of God can you change God's Word you have to yield to what that is so I said if you don't have the Holy Ghost how you gonna yield to it because there's nothing to pull you into that and brother Branham there was the baptism of the Holy Ghost and being a prophet where God spoke straight to him not to anybody else with a straight person to person there's no way you could have made a mistake on the seals he even tried to answer a question wrong on the sixth seal he did answer that question wrong and God said whoa stop you're not gonna make another mistake again you're gonna correct that and then we're going to go forward amen so that's what you and I are looking at we this the days of presuming are over the days of all these presuming of well I don't know if that brother so-and-so is right or I don't know sister so-and-so's right we got to go by what the word says let the word does let the word decide and divide because it will it will divide the joint in the marrow and the soul in the spirit everybody okay but listen he's the one that opened those seals let's read the rest of that quote he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals now who is he his Christ keeps crawling on up we're going to the rising of the Sun go to number right there that's good here's the one who opened the seals he ought here's those seals for the whole Word of God is what Christ and Christ is the seals that was open what is the opening of the seals then revealing Christ and where is Christ cuz look now we're going to get into something here in a minute about the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout now how many of you picture in your mind God coming from up here to here you just did didn't you shake your head yeah he's been here the whole time he came on the day of Pentecost he descended on the day of Pentecost he didn't go back up he stayed in the people but what happened was is now he's he's given us more revelation of word so that we can see exactly what was going on because we can't be presuming the days of I think is over and he said wow that's just human yes it's human beings but if you got the Holy Ghost inside of you I thought the Bible said he would lead you and guide you into all truth not part all truth and then so that's what people are looking for and you know what people are looking for truth some know where to find it some don't but you know what you have to be led of God and you can't be led of God and do things wrong I mean you know far as in the word wise what am I saying I'm saying listen Jesus Christ preached a perfect word when he was here for three and a half years right he made zero mistakes as the word now humanely he probably did but when he spoke that was the eternal Word of God because that's what you and I are gonna be judged by right so if there's a mistake in that then we can walk up to the white throne judgment we don't have to but if you walk up to the white throne judgment then now now God you made a mistake right there what am I saying if that was Christ and he was speaking and now it's Christ in you what are we doing what do we do it we've got to speak the same thing he spoke we've got to be under that same anointing that he was under all right everybody getting so far look at number five no let's go to number four on the seventh seal let's read this number four now he gets ready to read it we must remember that this seventh seal is the end of time we got into this couple Sundays ago it's the end of time of all things that's right the things written in the seventh sealed book sealed up of the plan of redemption and let me ask you one more time when when brother Branham talks about the plan of redemption you're not thinking horses and cows and trees right the plan of redemption is for humans it's for people the complete plan of redemption will be revealed and it will be manifested in a group of people first and then all the other world go back to the sixth seal listen the sixth seal is a purging time but it's because you and I are gone but when you and I come back we're gonna be what we're supposed to be had there not been a fall coming back in the Millennium with Christ the white rule and reign for a thousand years the sealed up of the plan of redemption from before the foundation of the world it every bit ends it is the end it is the end of the struggling world don't we all listen this is struggle and it's a struggle to come to church but look you gotta overcome something we are overcomers over comers of what I mean really over comers of what ourself ourself overcome ourself but it's the end of the struggling world it's the end of struggling nature it's the end of everything and there's the end of the trumpets the end of the vowels it's the end of the earth it's even the end of time time runs out the Bible said so over in Revelations 10 roll it up and keep everything runs out in this time the end of the at the end of this seventh seal so as I said before the seventh seal opened in a three-fold manners everybody got that say man you should have read the book three there's three things that happen just like they Street things happen in the sixth seal there's three things happen in the seventh seal and it's just really strange that three things happened in the Christ is the mystery God revealed there was three parts all God was reporting Christ costing the church take her back to the Garden of Eden so you see three it's what three is perfection seven is completion all right everything runs in this time at the end of the end of the seventh seal what you saying I'm saying look everybody's looking for this great event that it's just going to be theirs the seventh seal well that woke life of you up let me do that again get the other half but not really that's what we're that's what we're we're thinking our thinking is that this thing is so great that it's just gonna fall on my house one day no it's the process if redemptions the process then the seven seals are processed it's a three-fold process we'll get into that later on a little bit later but see at the end of this seventh seal so in other words it's not going to be here's the seventh seal folks this is it and now I've got an old road out on my chart you see my chart you Tony don't look at me like that you see that chart see it again that's what the Seventh Seal is watch that's what the whole mystery is because some of your going that's crazy it's got to be you and me Christ is not here in person and if it's revealing Christ boy it's just one plus one is two it's us it's God working through a group of people coming to the greatest plan of redemption that's ever been known but it's coming to an end of that listen well me and you come to the book to a change of the body that ends our Redemption tell me what else is left tell me Silas in heaven right that's the end for me and you now remember that's just but remember we come we say we come to an end remember let me try to explain it like this I you know you go to a play or you watch a movie or something and you watch that movie and you see the movie and then it comes up and says then now do you just erase that out of your mind and know when it comes to an end you see every but you remember every bit of that story right so is it the end no it's the beginning it's the beginning of the thoughts you had and this great plan of redemption it's been playing itself out since the book of Genesis and you and I are standing here looking back at that play but it's not silence in heaven it's showing you that this whole thing is for you and me because when when God said let us make man in our own image folks when we stand here within a body change that is the image he was looking at back in eternity and that is the end but what does it do it ends our time but it makes this eternal body spirit and soul so let's don't look at the end as an abrupt stop and nothing else goes on no always when there's end of something there's a beginning of something else you know it's you see hope he's baby back there you see that's what she had an end of her labor right thank God there was an end of that labor Oh your sisters thank God for the ending of that labor but what was it it was a beginning of a different life same way were you new birth your old life ended right you died well you're supposed to have died your old nature died and when they died that was the end of that old you that's what brother that's what brothers for brothers what brother Jesus was telling brother Nicodemus brother brother Jesus was telling brother Nicodemus well hey if we're joint heirs then we got to be brothers brother Jesus was telling brother Nicodemus if you don't get born again you go end because you know what if you don't get born again you will have an end hey you go I mean you'll go to hell and burn for whatever and whatever and whatever and whatever but you will come to an end but now if you're in Christ you can't come to an end you come to the end of a certain journey but that's just the beginning of your eternal part amen to me that's wonderful that tells us then there is an end of the old and a bringing in of the new now we've started our journey our Christian journey though and now that journeys got to come to an end earthly because your eternal now in your soul but not in your body but when we come to this great opening of the Seventh Seal then your body is going to catch up with your soul and it's going to end what mom and daddy brought on the earth that's going to come to an end but coming to an end it's not gonna be you're gonna go just know you become to the beginning of your eternal life when we take a body change that will begin our eternal life you say you can't begin to eternal life explain it any other way somebody's planning any other way because what I'm looking at right now is not eternal but we're working to that so that one day I hope in this congregation I look out here and we all have a glorified body that was the end of what I saw before but you didn't make you another different person you're the same person you just ended that life and begun a new one amen to me that's the whole seventh self same way with Christ Christ started his life was not an eternal body Jesus Christ started his life without an eternal body but what did he what did his journey take him to if he was the seventh seal and that was he still is then his journey is what we're gonna have to take and what is the way he started his way you said I know he was born nuts he came through a wound just like you did hey man he wasn't born in sin like we were but he came through the same way we did started as a baby come up to 30 years old so that was his journey and at the end of his journey his earthly life ended when they put him in a tomb but see Satan and all the other world thought that was it forever we not gonna ever see this guy again we're gonna seal it up but that was just the beginning of us that was the beginning of the bride of Jesus Christ because there was no other bride before that so now you and I are going to come to a journey and we're going to come to an end some have already been put in the tomb some are not gonna have to because Christ is our he done what he's done and I'll read it to you in just a minute when he came out of that tomb he redeemed your body he redeemed your body when he came out of that tomb and you and I if we are recipients of that then that's what this great Seventh Seal is it's an end of that old part and a beginning of a new that nobody has ever done before no one even Jesus Christ had to physically die there's somebody not going to physically die because this is going to open up in such a way so the inside is gonna take over the outside now watch let's go to number five real quick we got communion today number five seventh seal and there's three great teens that goes with it one unfolded today or yesterday the other one unfolded today and there's one thing that I cannot interpret because there's an unknown language now we're going to get into that but I want you to just give you a little thought me and brother Dale was telling like the other day one unfolded yesterday the other unfolded today and there's one thing I cannot interpret because it's in an unknown language now those are three things right one open yesterday which opened to the oh it actually opened to him while he was on the sixth seal okay then one today and then there's one I cannot interpret cuz it's in an unknown language we'll get to that them in the future but remember there's three things but I was standing right there and looked right straight at it and this is the third pole coming up and what's the third Pole it's the opening of the word it's not this and that in the other it's not fishing or a tent and all this other stuff it's the opening of the word that's what he said amen it's the opening it's the apex I was thinking it while brother Dale was preaching you look right here and you see this at the top well what brother Branham talked about he talked about that magnet what was that main to doing it was pulling up up this was metal and this has got to be metal you got to be the same substance he's coming back after his self he's not coming back after you he's coming back after his self so it's gonna magnetize and he's gonna what pull us up that's why I said if we if there's not a pull in our life for us to want to study more and come to church more more than we did before the worst of words the worst to pull what's pulling me is what's inside oh yeah there's a million other things that could pull you away different things that you know that we're human but when we got when we come down to one thing of our focus our focus is is I don't want to die I want to take a body change I don't care if I get 90 and 9 sorry some of you are gonna be a hundred and fifty-nine but well if I it doesn't matter to Abraham it didn't matter to you it shouldn't matter we gotta just keep going on and keep going on all right so that's that's my heart's desire is that somebody will get this and it'll take you to change the body and it will not come from false words false word can't change your body what brought Jesus out of that tomb was who he was who was he he was God in human flesh who are you God in human flesh all right in the Holy Spirit of God oh my that's the reason all heaven was silent she just shows us from God it fits these actually the promises from the end of the message you notice for the end of time message this seal after all he's revealed all the six seals but he don't say nothing about the seventh and the end time seal when it starts will be absolutely a total secret according to the Bible what's the secret according to the Bible what is it Colossians 1:26 even the mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations but now it's made manifest to his Saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory not Christ in brother branham which transferred to know it's Christ in you the hope of glory and the endtime seal when it starts will be absolutely a total secret according to the Bible they all writes amen hey man they okay all right now let's read this next one just for your just for your reading enjoyment brother Brown said seven is God completed number so we know it had to come to the seven for us to be here now listen you're here for a purpose you're here under that completion because you're alive and you're listening listen it's got to take somebody to receive the word not just somebody that preaches the word it's got to be somebody to receive the word and you become the word as you receive the word that's what I mean if you've not received more word if you've not in just I am say year if you've not received more word and you not that you no way that's not meaning that well I used to quote 15 scriptures now unquote 18 the devil's got you beat he can quote the Bible back board but he can never get a revelation of what that thing says you can get a revelation of what that says and the revelation is the essence of the message that we're looking for all right hey man that all right so now now it's three first Thessalonians let's get to our thoughts just for a few minutes for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain Who am I talking to we which car live and remain he's talking exactly to me and you you see how focused that can be when you read the Word of God that's not speaking to the denominational world sorry that's speaking to the Bride of Christ that is alive we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep so that must be what we're doing now we're preventing them they're still asleep for the Lord Himself and as I told you just a few minutes ago you're looking at that scripture and you're going well that's the Lord is descending now look at this word right here so if he's in you now and he's descending there's two cells huh there's two cells and brother Brown said if you got two ones who the devil and ones got so let's don't look at this great ball of the Lord himself shall descend he's already in you but remember the dissension is the mystery the mystery is he's here already this is for everybody around you getting it he's already here listen he's not descending from you know we don't have to make a hole in the ceiling for him the Lord himself shall descend so that you can understand him not that he's not here but he's he's descending so that you can understand him you know what you take a you take a professor in college man I had one that he was a doctor low-pass good grief he was Cuban smoked them big old Cuban cigars about that long but he would tell you stuff about chemicals and compounds and he was way under in the heavens but you know what by the end of the by the end of the the hour he had descended to where I could understand what he's talking about he might get what I just said he was so and he did he has all this huge knowledge of all these different compounds but when he got finished it was laughable how simple he made it he was a suiting to me that's point of a good teacher because he had to know this stuff but he descended down in what his voice he descended in a voice that you you know what didn't change his person Sam teacher that was up there before Sam guy that I saw Monday through Friday second period of ever every day thought we knew dr. Lopez was gonna start up here but when he got done he'd be down here because the next day you had a pop quiz on what he it sent talked about today before how many of you kids the teachers do that they give you a little pop quiz well we don't make a hundred he made it so simple but we knew he was going to start up here but we knew he was going to end up down here so now pull that back up so the Lord shall descend from heaven not moving position if he's and I'm going back one more time like this hit me hard last night for the Lord Himself now if himself is up here and he's coming he's not in you but if he's in you it's the same self but what he's doing is he has descended in his word so that you can understand him more you can understand him better cuz remember brother Brown says when you got born again you got everything you needed for your journey but now you didn't stop at the start at the top of that pyramid because you still had a temper you still need a patience we still need a god and that's knowledge virtue and all these different things we still needed that but God descended descended so that we can understand him and then what's he do he takes you right back up to worries that for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout now we talked about the shout last Sunday or Sunday before laughs now let's read what brother Brown said we'll get back come back to this and man I want to see I want you to see what this voice is now once you know it's great things taking place here just a few minutes the word says here in 2nd Thessalonians that there's three so now if there's three things and if it's three things that brother branham saw in the seventh seal there's three things in the six fold the threefold purpose of the sixth seal seventh seal Christ a mystery God revealed and now we got a three-fold purpose of the Lord Himself appearing now from verse thirteen to sixteen verse there's three things that has to happen before the Lord Himself appears now remember where does he appear not in a physical form until the Millennium where does he appear take your finger and do like this ah okay quickly now so we can close the first thing happens notice a shout of voice a trumpet let's read it now see if it's right for the Lord Himself sixteenth verse shall descend from heaven with a shout with a voice the Archangel and Trump of God now I'll promise you that people sitting there listening to that sermon did the same thing well God's up here and he's got to descend down here saying that's where revelation now we've got a further manone that revelation that he's always been inside of you he's descended in his word because watch I'll show you the second three things happen a voice a shout a voice of trumpet has to happen before Jesus appears now shout Jesus does all three of them when he's descending now I want to ask you a question what good is a shout kinda like being in the bathroom taking a shower all by yourself there's nobody in the house and you're just saying and you know what you sing like Mike like whatever the greatest singer in the world is right man you can carry a tune and you know you you you clap for your own self but what good is that what good is it that's what I'm telling you we got to see these that he's not descending to us he's descending in us there's a big difference he's not descending to us he's descending in us all right now look three things - the boys a shout of oyster trumpet and even with the boys you can be the greatest orator in the world and you can set a pin you can give a speech for three hours if the if the auditorium is empty what have you done but see God's not that way because remember his word will not return Boyd he has to have somebody to listen and respond to what's being said three things has to happen before Jesus appears now shout Jesus does all three of them when he's he's he's descending a shout what is a shout it's the message going for it now look the message the Living bread of life bringing forth the bride he connects that right to the bride the message bringing forth the bride that's what this message is for it's not to bring forth another prophet it's not to bring forth William Branham again it's to bring forth a bride amen let's go to the next one should be the rapture all right look the first thing when he starts descending from heaven there's a shout what is it the message now remember the message didn't come from up there the message came to us through a prophet that had the message inside of him he was a messenger of the message huh there's a shout what is it a message to get the people together so it has to have a response we've responded to that something responded by getting the new birth so I'm responding by getting a new birth and growing in grace and knowledge some God that received it and keeps on moving and keeps on going there's all different things a message comes forth first now lap'd Remington that's what we're in right now we're in lamp trimming time we have oil if you've got the new birth you have oil you have the lamp you have heard - what the voice of the bridegroom say wake up because you were part of the five wise virgins a message comes forth first now lap trimming time rise and trim your lamps what watch was it the seventh not the six the seventh behold the bridegroom cometh rise and trim your lamps and they did some of them found they didn't even have any oil in their lamps that's in people that think that you always was eternal till they've never been talking to you birth and man we were talking about that last night you know he as we were talking and I'm not and I'm not being critical of people I'm just telling you I'm I'm critical because if they've got a congregation the people in that congregation of people is taking their word as the word they're not gonna change you can only go as high as your pastor so if he's pretty if this brother preaches that there's no written on long enough redemption for your body then people are never gonna come to a place of having faith for a body change you and I we gonna come to a body change because we got faith to come to a body change because this message in this church is in the body change hey man a resurrection antibodies change their bye all right without okay but you just feel for the people rise and trim your lamp why there was five vote foolish virgins that thought they were they were virgins they didn't have any old why they were taught wrong hello they were taught wrong that's a whole thing being taught right it's lamp trimming time we're in the seventh watch the bridegroom call comes from where heaven now it comes from here I'll prove it to you just a second let me go through this real quick don't worry about the other one let's go to Joshua remember Joshua commanded the people saying you shall not shout not going back y'all going by that one yeah there you go good Joshua white spoken to the people remember Joshua commanded the people they walked around that thing and didn't say a word but you know what they were doing they were doing what Joshua told them to do and they were walking and wasn't saying a word but you know what they were doing something because God told them that last day he said you walked seven times around that city and don't say a word listen the old saying is silence is maddening silence is maddening can you imagine a city as big as Atlanta with walls all up so high that they run chariot races around it and everybody is looking and there's just a little group of people and they go around one time don't say a word they go around second time no spell word they're just marching you know they're not over there sharpening their swords and getting their spirit their marching third time somebody's going hey how many times have they been around in here well this is number four I think they walked around seven times he never said a word never said work silence but on that seventh time Joshua commanded them to shout and they did the shout it wasn't Joshua it was two people all right let's go to the next one so meet to me that is I mean you brother Brahim said thirty minutes of silence it's not it's not a said it's not what do you say it's not so bad when something's going on but when something just stops for 30 minutes seems like an eternity says that would be maddening though to see just dead people walking in dead silence and all of a sudden in that seventh when they just let her go and whatever they standing on falls out from under him that's God showing you something now look now the rapture message the shout the voice in the trumpet shout the mess a messenger getting the people ready the second is a voice of the resurrection the same voice now remember Jesus is not here on this earth until the Millennium but there will be a resurrection and a body change before we leave okay the second is a voice of the resurrection the same voice that a loud voice in Saint John 11 38 to 44 that called Lazarus from the grave getting the bride together the shout then the resurrection of the dead sea to be caught up with it now watch the three things take place the next is what was a trumpet a boys he gets a little confused a shout a voice of trumpet that's what it is now watch this now the third thing is a trumpet which always at the feast of the trumpets it's calling the people to the feast now that will be the bride supper so this third thing that trumpet is going to call us to what the bride suffered the Lambs supper with the bride in the sky that's when we leave the first thing comes forth is his message calling the bride together the next thing is a resurrection of the sleeping bride the ones that died back in the other ages they're caught together now who is that coming through the bride the voice of the resurrection will be in the bride and it's the same voice they said Lazarus come forth so it can't be two people all right in the trumpet the feast of heavens encounter while that's the thing takes place friends we're right there ready now the only thing the church coming out has got to lay before the Sun to ripen look I want you to read the rest of this you're not blind people I'm talking to you today paragraph 156 you are not you're not blind people you're sensible people and if I stood here and said those things for prejudice I said because its life because I'm responsible to God for saying it and I must say it and my message this is that right here all the time knowing back there under healing and so forth like that was just to catch the people's attention knowing the message would come now that wasn't a message the healing campaign wasn't the message he just said it I'm reading you what your prophet said knowing the message would come and here it is and them seven seals open those mysteries and showing those things is what happened I didn't know it he does now next one number 10 godless evil age no look watch this this is where I miss is where I'm really took too long first I guess you listen only to one voice my sheep know my voice now remember it's the shout the voice and the trumpet there's got to be a shout to gather us together and then a voice to speak to us and through us but what is his voice any man's voice is his word so there's got to be a shout right to gather the people together and that voice is a voice of the bride a man's voice is his word and this is it the Bible not one word to be added to or taken from it just stay right with that voice a stranger they will not follow a denomination now let's look at number 11 real quick 11 and 12 oh I want to get to what's this what do you say in Malachi 4 would restore restore back the original Pentecostal faith now look this is what is the first part of his message back to the people with the same Pentecostal message the same Pentecostal sign the same Pentecostal evidence the same God the same power the same teaching everything exactly with the vindication of the same pillow fighter stroke pull down a road down to Damascus amongst us today not descending amongst us today doing the same thing you did in that day uniting we see the nations uniting we see the world uniting we see the churches uniting we see the bride uniting uniting with the voice remember I just read you the brother Brown said the man's word is his voice his voice is the word right so let's put that in there uniting with the voice and the voice is God and as the voice as the bridegroom being the voice and the bridegroom being the hearer of the voice they come together in the union they were not read you're not like a wedding see they're getting ready for a wedding and they become one the word becomes you you become the word the voice becomes you you become the voice Jesus said at that day you know what all the father is I am all I am you are and all you are I am and that day you'll know that I'm the father the father me and I in you and you and me see at that day what day this day we find out the great hidden mysteries of God being revealed oh how I like that all right let's read this last one then we'll be finished mmm it is the rising of the Sun now notice this quickening power Zoe bringing the voice or the word the mind that was in Christ was in you then I'm trying to show you that you when you raved when God raised Jesus from the dead he raised up you also we're gonna believe what prophecy okay all right we're gonna believe what he said right when God raised Jesus from the dead he raised up you also and also quicken to life with him you are now quicken to life although then you were but an attribute in his thoughts what we weren't people running around but when Jesus resurrected we resurrected inside of him amen if that same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you it'll also quicken your mortal body that's in Romans 8 when we gonna start believing it but God had saw all in him at the finish when God looked down upon the body now watch the spirit left him in the Garden of Gethsemane now this is where a lot of people in the message say that that brother branham means that Jesus just died a man he didn't say he had to die man he said he had to die , a man he had to die as a man what spirit left him there anointing that was on him for his ministry and he couldn't die we spoke on that many times before the met the anointing that came on him at the river Jordan didn't make him God but it sure gave him a ministry for three and a half years that he could not be killed they tried to kill him many many times but what happened that same spirit left off of him in the Garden of Gethsemane so he could die as a human mortal man that was God God anointed that flesh which was human flesh what I'm not gonna try to put words in brother Brian's mouth but what's he saying God anointed that flesh so he couldn't die he had to lift that spirit off of him well if that gnawing off of him so he could die and he didn't if he'd have went up there as God he'd have never died that kind of death can't kill God and you still can't kill God but he didn't have to do it but remember he went there with you in him see God had never separated the bride from the groom yet so when God looked down upon the body of Christ he saw both male names the body you read that again huh hey buddy wake when God looked down upon the body of Christ he saw both male and female it was all redeemed in that one buddy see they are one same same word voice the same word spoke of the groom speaks of the bride there's no separation you can't separate Jesus Christ from his bride the same word the same voice spoke of the groom speaks of the bride there's not two separate entities here let's stand our feet you say brother wait you just making us too close we have not made it close enough because we you and I kids no way we can change our own body people have tried to substitute it by facelifts and paint and hairdo and whatever more but God is going to change you back to a 20 year old person and angle you know what it ain't gonna it ain't gonna upset him it ain't gonna make him no less God it's gonna make him do exactly what he said he was gonna do like brother Browns brother brown said right there whatever scripture speaks at the bridegroom also speaks of you the bride he descended what a bride he's been here the whole time but he's descending so that we can understand him through a shout to get the people together you you heard a shout one day when you were out in the world and doing the things a lot of you didn't grow up in the message like some of us did some of you were out doing these things of the world but when you heard that voice well you heard the Xiao Yu heard the message well what was the message the shouting the voice is pretty much the same okay it's the same thing but then when you come into the message see now we're hearing the voice not just the voice of somebody speaking we're hearing the voice of the resurrection where we say there's no death in what we're talking to you about go to the denomination's they know one thing's for sure under tradition they're all wound up and under tradition they're all going to go to the white throne judgment and under tradition they're going to a seven-year tribulation amen I said tradition that's what they believed but it never was spoke up in the Bible so it's the tradition you and I do not live by tradition we live by the absolute perfect Word of God amen god bless your heart let's bow our head Heavenly Father we're moving into another part of the service Lord them take communion I pray now that what we've said will enter into the heart of the believer Lord and truly pull us up a little bit higher tell us who we already are not what we're going to become but what we already are because 2,000 years ago in Calvary when you look down on that body you saw a redeemed bride and now you've waited for 2,000 years to be able to look face to face with your bride and lord I know you will Lord through the revealing of your word that voice of the resurrection it's absolutely now it's resurrecting us sitting us in heavenly places but that same voice that called Lazarus from the grave will come forth to a bride with enough faith to bring the people that have been passed away for 2,000 years in the dust of the earth and in the ocean and all the different places that that they passed away and Lord what great quickening power that's going to be but it will happen because you've told us that it would it will happen in our time here Lord it will happen under the anointing of this message of the our Lord I pray that you would anoint us again for this journey keep anointing us over and over again Lord let us not forget where we come from and what we're doing here and where we're going father just be with the ones that are sick give them a touch now Lord they'd be anybody sick here in the congregation I pray right now that you would heal them father under the anointing of the word Lord I pray that you would touch them Lord oh absolutely I pray this you forgive us of our sins that we can take this communion with no with no hesitation Lord all the little things that we do in life that's not pleasing to you the little human things Lord I pray that you'd forgive us forgive me Lord for not speaking better or studying more lord I pray that you all to do that study more pray more be more attentive to you father we pray that you'd be with us now in this further service this great communion that we're about to take Lord showing and symbolizing that one day we're gonna literally sit down at a table and you're gonna the the literal flesh God is gonna serve us this communion boy what a day what a time when we can sit there and not have to worry about working and life and all the different things we can just have a joyous wedding supper with communion with you and then knowing that that's just the beginning of our eternal destination that's just the beginning that now we're going to come back to earth for a millennium then we're gonna go into a future home that we're gonna live there for an eternity father grant these things we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen brother Dale god bless you we'll be speaking on the The Voice a little more next Sunday so Lord bless you
