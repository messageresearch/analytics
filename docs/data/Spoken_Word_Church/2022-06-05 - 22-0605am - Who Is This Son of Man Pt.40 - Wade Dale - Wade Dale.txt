they can wash it for you in one of the houses so but we are going to have a good time we have one of them with us today sister ariana she is the oldest of the of the morales children and we had the youngest here the other day and she was baptized and today she's going to be baptized so we're going to work on that middle one though we're going to work on jasmine so uh the lord's moving the lord's moving i can see it in different in other churches and i can see it in people this world wants god so let me read you this quote brother brown in a deep call to the deep 1952 he says lord jesus blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled now feel the longing and desire of every heart in here and make these christians who are called by your name you said the people that are called by my name shall assemble themselves together and pray and then i'll hear from heaven and heal the land he said they were the salt of the earth brother isaac now we're talking about he's talking about wanting to be salty so i pulled up this quote but if the salt has lost its savior it's henceforth good for nothing to be cast out tried under the foot of men now father we realize that salt is a savior if it's contacted if it contacts but there must be a contact a settling and now may the holy spirit that has given new birth to every one of these children of god by faith may they be so salty tonight in their faith that the unbeliever that might be sitting in here say oh that's the way that's the end that's the way i believe christianity and may they accept him and may the sick be healed the lost be saved and the backsliders reclaimed god be glorified be salty be salty it's got to come from you though the contact has got to come from you be salty [Applause] compel them to want what you got but you got to live it first amen that's why i said church is important coming together is important being a family is important being a church family is important it's important because who's going to divide us god will never divide us satan will always try to divide us amen so let's bow our heads we'll get can start on the sentiment son of man here just a second dear heavenly father thank you for this lovely day that you give us father we pray now that you sanctify us for this journey be with the people lord may we realize lord that you're working in a group of people because we're coming to an end we're coming to a revelation that's never been before a father to where death will have no dominion over us in the physical realm we know it still does lord as we were watching last night brother biscuit there in his late 80s and we can see the toils of life and all this that's messing with his mind and messing with his body and it's just the sin curse being made manifest but father inside of that man is a soul and that soul i believe has the new birth and this is just as eternal as god is and satan is looking at the outside but lord jesus may we today look at the inside may we know that our inside is right and then like the prophet said be salty and display it on the outside father forgive us of our sins and bless this day lord be with the ones that are sick ones that are not with us ones that are traveling give them traveling mercies lord and bless each one lord that's on the prayer list that we pray for the ones down below my feet for salvation lord i pray bring them in father bring them in under the correct way which is water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ and receiving the holy ghost in their soul not just on their spirit father we pray that you just please lord be the active participant in this service father we give it to you in jesus name amen who is this son of man part number 40. in the beginning was the word and where it was with god in the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we behold his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth now that's that's what john saw that because this is john this is john the revelator this is one of the disciples john we beheld his glory we saw him there we knew who he was the glory is the only begotten of the father and they weren't confused in their baptism they weren't confused in their trinitarianism they knew who that man was especially when on the day of pentecost they knew exactly who he was and where he went he went in them so you may be seated in the lord as blessing to the reading of the word we'll talk about a little bit this afternoon now i want you to understand one thing water baptism does not save your soul never has never will because the saving of your soul is the atonement that was at calvary it was the giving of a life but to start your christian journey you must start correct and we'll talk about this afternoon god started his church on the day of pentecost and he wants it to end the same way if he started with baptism in the name lord jesus christ he's going to have to end up in the baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ amen so we'll get to that this afternoon but i was compelled i was out in my out in the garden working and one of those fits hit me just on water baptism you say water baptism we've been in mexico 50 years what about water baptism i just got to thinking the institution of that john baptized jesus and then you come on up and you see the water baptism it is extremely important extremely important and it's extremely extremely important to be baptized the correct way and i think people are seeing that more now that there's got to be a name involved just like here where there's got to be a name this now remember the son of man you can't we're not going to baptize today in the day in the name of the son of man even though jesus christ is the son of man that is a title and we'll get into that i looked up the a definition of of name and title it says a title is something attached to but a name is a person all right so we want the person of god we don't want the title we don't want to be baptized in the name of the son of man but to baptize in the name of the son of man you can do that in the name of the lord jesus christ that's why matthew 28 19 there's no doing away with that that's the only way you can baptize it's in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost and that is the lord jesus christ so we don't we're the only ones that have the christian baptism correct in this whole world they're all deceived sorry so listen also we're predestinated to adoption we're not predestinated just to come to church and live a good life and though that's wonderful but we've come to a place to where we have to live and make this thing manifest because we were talking yesterday you know it's good to be a christian and wonderful to be a christian but to get more of god to get more of god who all wants more of god today we all want more of god to get more of god you've got to grow to get more out of life you've got to grow so it's not your birth your birth has to get you here but when that birth gets you here then we have to have what tutors and governors we have to have people that teach us and train us but now remember the bible tells us later on that we don't have need of teachers anymore well now by the way that's good then we'll just all set home we won't get it all ourselves that's not what that means that means that tutor don't have to teach you how to walk anymore that tutor don't have to teach you to go from milk to meat no you're standing on your own do you know today i'm just going to speak to you today but the revelation has got to come from god that's inside of you not from this teacher it's got to come from you what's inside of you has got to speak back and say that ain't nothing but the truth so that's where it's coming from everybody's wanting to hang on people's words yeah let's hang on people's words let's hang on the words of the son of man amen as long as we preach the gospel and preach the message of the hour i believe we're preaching the son of man so it's not your birth brother bob was talking about this morning you can have the baptism of the holy ghost every day of your life on your flesh you know in your spirit realm that'll make you go to church and make you do emotional things that's why i said about justification that's a hard place to stay because that's what satan will do he'll make you laxadaisical he'll say you've got feelings emotions you read you study no somewhere down the line you're going to fall off that's what's happening now this is the day of manifestation of the sons of god well it's also going to manifest the sons of the devil too amen in the manifestation of the sons of god is going to be the manifestation of the sons of the devil and the seals being broken open what's the first thing happens the voice of that combat beast says come and see it's not the devil sitting there going i'm going to see this before you will know god is going to reveal it to us first and then the white horse rider will be what he'll have to leave just like these unclean spirits that's why i want you to fight i want you to pull i want you to do everything you can to get those unclean spirits out of you because they're wanting to come back they want to come back they want to come back drive them out listen we have enough fighting with fighting our own self amen everything good we good okay all right so now you don't have to pull the chart up because everybody knows where we're going with this we got that big wide foundation and you got to start on that big wide foundation right there and what is it it's called faith you got to start with faith but now watch we're going to read in just a few minutes though where the prophet of god says okay now that you're born again and you've got this light precious faith that alone is not going to do it so faith alone's not gonna do it you say well faith yes faith based is everything you gotta base it but you can't just say hey listen let me ask you a question how many have you seen jesus die on the cross not one of you physically saw him but in your heart you have that person inside of you so he is revealing that to you and you have faith but then you got to add to that faith because when we get to virtue when we get to the virtues maybe on wednesday night when we get to the virtues that virtue is strength that's something that god is going to give you and then you're not going to hold on to it you're going to give it back out jesus didn't hold on to his virtue he gave it out all the time the woman touched his garment the different things he healed the sick raised the dead he virtue was flowing from him and that's what you and i are going to have to come to where virtue where you can as we were talking even last night and we talk about life a little bit and then we talk about the lord and i'm talking about when we're outside there's a place though that we all connect under one thing and that's the baptism of the holy ghost the new birth in our life helping our life to change because like i said before we live a human being 90 of the time all right 99 percent of the time we live a human being all right god gets about ten percent maybe that's let's do 90 and 10. that'll get in in the scriptures we give him ten percent of our time do we give him ten percent of our time figure that out for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god and that's what we've seen we've seen the spirit of god move as i was watching brother biscuit last night at his 50th anniversary he was explaining about a healing that had come because of the bypasses and i thought man when i met that brother in 20 what was it oh six when he came down here in in gainesville and he had his um he brought we had a um a convention there and he brought all his people down from from bible way just about it you know and they kind of like we are now they kind of got everything all set up and i thought man what a vibrant man well now you look at him and he can hardly speak that's the fall but that's a paradox too because i can look at him through my eyes and see a revelation that satan can't see satan sees a man fixing to go to the grave if the body change doesn't happen but i see a man that's already been changed i said man it's already eternal i see a man that's already 20 years old i see a man that's going to be able to preach we were talking about last night preaching yeah i believe we'll preach in the in in the millennium and in the future home and all the different things because there's a message of cheer down through the endless ages there's a lot of people going to be given eternal life that didn't even know that jesus existed on earth and you're going to be able to gloriously sit with him for just millions of years and just expound on everything you know about god and how he saved your soul yes that is if you got saved for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are not going to be they are the sons of god so when you receive the new birth that we're talking about now then you are a son and daughter of god cannot be taken away from that that's right for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry out by father or daddy daddy the spirit itself bear witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children okay children if children then heirs to what add to your faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and the capstone which is love there's a new song out i don't know who it's by but it's some it's on a contemporary station christian station and it talks about love is all we need the love that they project is not all we need because if without the new birth it's only feel your love it'll take you to a perversion every single time that's why you see now and you say you say what do you mean well you look at these people falling away from the message what are they falling for a perversion there's a perverse spirit that's driving them away from the truth they just don't realize it because they got the new birth they got the holy ghost on their spirit and not in their soul but now if we become children you got to know today whether you're a child of god or not a child of god is led by the spirit of god and we are joint heirs with christ or whatever christ gets that's why brother brown could stand and say she is him because whatever we read the scripture about jesus is talking about you amen can you believe that then john 1 1. in the beginning was the word words with god and word was god and the word was made flesh in 2022 and dwelt among us folks this god dwelling here he decided this he decided to put everything he had on a bride he didn't put it on an angel he didn't put it on the devil he put it on a bride he put it on god and human flesh inside of a group of people that's what he decided so i'm just going to follow the plan and if children then heirs the heirs of god and join heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be what glorified together now we were talking about justification i was listening to a brother a young a man testifying the other day and he'd been listening to the message and kind of a new convert he said i've been fooled i've been fooled i've been fooled into believing i was a christian i've been fooled into believing that everything i did was right i've been fooled i thank god for that if you don't know your food you're gonna stay in what you got and brother and and god said he'd give you a strong delusion and let you believe the lie the lie and be damned by it but no that's okay that's why i said i like ignorance but ignorance becomes stupidity when you continue in ignorance for so long and man it's not bad to be ignorant it's just you don't know but once light has shined on it now see you take somebody like the brother you take somebody like somebody you've testified to or that you've brought into the message of the hour you present it to them and then you just kind of back off because then what's going to happen is if there's something inside of them a desire to do better he's they're going to come back to you and say tell me some more amen it's kind of what happened with brother dale with brother mo you know they started riding with each other southern general motors and brother moat was playing the tapes and brother dale was like what is this who is this guy and then back and forth and back and forth and all of a sudden he says tell me more tell me more now there's some that we're going to testify to that say don't tell me no more amen we've met those where they go in a totally opposite direction well that's okay not everybody this is not for everybody when i mean the message of the hour i mean the true christian walk amen listen folks i'll get to it just a minute but i'm going to tell you now moses brought a message to himself no it wasn't for moses nope moses go up on the mountain moses go up on the mountain and i'll meet you up there and i'm going to write 10 things on a piece of paper or i mean a piece of stone and you're gonna take those and you're just gonna stay up there and it's all yours he said take what i said go down there and give it to the people that's what brother branham did prophet of god go back into my mind get these mysteries and bring them and give them to my people not keep it for yourself give it to the people moses comes down he gives it to the people oh he gets mad throws them down he goes back again but what did moses he said moses whatever you saw remember brother brown said he went into heaven and got the tabernacle saw jesus christ made a cat made the wrote about the tabernacle and brought it what and he give it to the people so the message of the hour is not william brown's message it's my message in your message and then whatever happens with that man that has nothing to do with me that's between him and god but he brought me the message of the hour which is that jesus christ is going to live in a bride and going to have full preeminence he's never had full preeminence since he left this earth 2000 years ago there's never been full preeminence there's always been a low of this and a low of that and a little the other a strand of this and a strand of that but then the prophet of god said my message is to tie up those loose ends take those loose strands and tie them back together so that god can work through a group of people not just work through him but work through a group of people what was he sent for for himself no he was sent for you and me he was sent for people same way with jesus christ he just i didn't come on my own court he said i came because of you you know what he did he come to save me i don't know if he can save you or not but he did come to save me romans 8 verse 10 but what saith thee the word is nigh the even in thy mouth and in the heart that is the word of faith which we preach that thou shalt confess with the mouth the lord jesus and believe in thy heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved that's what we're talking about just for the for the visitors to back up a little bit we're talking about justification in its baby form this is not even in the body of christ yet this is just getting your chop your sins chopped off and being totally repentant i mean sorrowfully repentant not repentant because you got caught you repent because there's something inside of you said i need to change this is not going to work anymore that's why i always when i pray i said lord stir their water make them where they don't sleep at night make them wear where if they want to put that booze back in their mouth make them so sick they throw up and have to have to go to the hospital whatever you got to do you put that cigarette in your mouth i hope you choke on it that's how desperate we got to be if we want to get rid of those things that's how desperate we got to be and you know what god will do it if you'll ask him that thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and believe in thy heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved because you know what if you if you believe that god raised him from the dead where is he now he's in you he's in you guys he's in us he'll just go back to heaven and stay up there no he came back over the day of pentecost for with the heart not the mind with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation i confess my sins i don't want to live this way anymore i want to act act different that's what we're going to talk about tonight we're going to talk about or this afternoon we'll call why you call it the book of acts that's how the apostles acted that's why it's called the book of acts it's how they acted it's the acts of the apostles acts romans 8 verse 3 says being justified freely by his grace you cannot justify yourself no way you can't chop off your past sins i was talking to somebody the other day they were talking about well you know if we're so powerful to be able to speak things into existence we'd be able to maybe speak people into existence i said nope that's reserved for god alone now we're part of that creator we're a mini creator but we cannot speak souls into existence god alone thank god that god alone can only speak souls into existence because he's going to be able to speak him out of existence when we get to the end of this thing but listen if you have the soul of god inside of you he can't speak itself out of existence so then we are connected with god but we are little creators but we can't create a person only god can do that we create yeah i see now the creation of our union between husband and wife i see that creation but it didn't bring us all inside of you it brought a shell so a soul can fit in it and that came from god amen and then it becomes perverted as you go along because we are what born in sin shaping iniquity spouse from my mother's womb come forth a liar but being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus whom god has set forth to be a perpetuation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness look for the remission of sins that are past not for the future sins that's why you have to die daily that's why you have to get up every morning and say and don't say look don't say god i know i'm going to sin i'm going to pray this morning and i'm done no you don't you don't know what you're going to do that day but now the end of the night when you get ready to go to bed god i got a book here that's full of these things that i didn't have this morning and i pray that you would put them in your sea of forgetfulness never to be remembered again and you know what he's just to do that but the righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of god to declare i say at this time his righteousness not ours that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth believeth not believe everybody believes in jesus you believe in jesus drunk you believe in jesus yep saw him other day but believeth in jesus watch his works watch what he does that's why i say with this baptism all this this we're getting getting a lot of people baptized almost 20 now be baptized we got to watch the results through the years we've watched the results and they've left i was looking at brother joe's going to compile uh all of our baptisms into one like one long string with the music behind it and thank god that we've got people that can do that and that we can be the benefit of it but i look back in 2015 and 2016 the ones i was watching the other night and and a couple of those people that we baptized and not even around here anymore i don't like that there was something they came to and then they left it as brother bob was talking about today about romans you've come to the knowledge of the truth you come right up to the door and then you walk away jesus said it would be better that you'd never known it than to do what you did and then walk away from it where's the boasting then it is excluded by what law of works nope but by the law of faith therefore we conclude that paul what are you talking about okay let me give you the conclusion therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law the do's and the don'ts all right so that's baby form justification doesn't put you in the body it will save you talk about this a little bit last night it will save you there's a difference in being saved and being born again but they're connected everybody with me they're connected because you can be saved die tomorrow and go to heaven but you got to go to the white throne judgment you got to stay dead a thousand years you got to come up and give what an account of what you're doing now look you won't have to give an account what you did before but remember that same spirit's still there motivating you to do the same things you did before but if you come to the white throne judgment god is just to say okay i chopped your past sins off there's nothing you could do about that because you come to this place and you've reached this spot you couldn't go any further therefore i will impart to you eternal life and you can live on the earth but not in the city now listen no one sitting in this building no one sitting in this building can claim that no one now maybe maybe marty or some of the little ones below the age of accountability maybe some of the brother ryan's girl but when you come to the age of accountability you can't plead that not sitting here in this church you can't because you know you know that you stopped you know that you hadn't went any further you know that you might have got saved but you lost it oh brother once saved always saved no one's born again always born again not once saved always saved in that aspect because you see that in a denominational world what that's the lie of the devil they they shake their hand they give the letter or they have this thing in the baptist church you know and then they live 40 years and then they have a funeral well they go back to that same thing well oh john was baptized at nine years old he's got a letter in good standing in the church so he's got to be going to heaven no if john didn't give his life to jesus christ he's going to hell like brother brady says if he don't change he's going to hell we think we're brash he did that at a funeral one time did you talk about this mine he's so good said if he didn't repent on his deathbed said he's on his way to hell okey-dokey then i wouldn't try that over here some family member may shoot you but it's the truth we put a lot of people in heaven the world does just because they're good and they did this and they did that that's the do's and don'ts if they're born again they'll go to heaven if they're not born again they ain't they might be given eternal life but it's going to be way down the road and they're going to be up there shaking in their boots because they know they missed an opportunity but maybe god to give enough grace to say you walked so far and you couldn't go any further so i'm going to give you eternal life but no bride bride that's sitting here today you already have that you already have eternal life you already went through justification you already went through sanctification you had the unclean spirit drug out of you amen right here sanctification when the unclean spirit has gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest find us none they hate being out of a body what did those demons say at legion hey let's go somewhere jesus christ i think jesus kind of looked around he said well you're not going in me and you're not going back in that guy they said oh we there's some pigs over here on the on the hill we'll just go getting them pigs and you know what god jesus said go right go and they went and got in them pigs and pigs did the best thing they could do they went and committed suicide i'm so i'm not advocating suicide i'm you understand what i mean but if the devil gets on you like that they had enough sense to try to get the devil off of them those pigs did or swine then he said i will return into my house which i came out and when he has come he findeth it empty swept and garnished we come to church everything's good we've been baptized we've we believing on the lord we we're coming to church and see that's what i mean that that one first when you start and begin at the beginning will tell what you're going to end up because you've come to a new way of life you've come to a new thought you come to a new attitude but what's going to happen is if you don't get filled with the holy ghost you're gonna the unclean spirits are gonna just you're never gonna bring fruit you're just gonna be in a message church you're gonna be gone two weeks you're gonna be gone a month you're gonna show back up i i like what brother donnie said he's talking about you know brother branham he said that people will be at the end time when the bride's gone the people will still be thinking they're getting saved and full of the holy ghost he said finally they're coming to church finally they're getting in church that's what he was talking about he said if you don't go to church he said you miss it you're going to miss it over there he said you need to come to church and hear it now instead of having to hear that little still small voice say you missed it you will not if you're born again because that voice is going to be in heaven with you attached to it then he said i will return into my house and whence i came out and when he has come he finds his empty swept and garnished then goethe and take of them seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they entered in and dwelt there dwelled there dwelled there listen folks those demons are coming back trust me they're more diligent than we are most of the time they're going to come back because they're uncomfortable walking through dry places and can't find somebody to work through so they're going to come back with a vengeance and they're going to work inside of you if you let them back in and they're going to dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be unto this wicked generation how many believes we live in a wicked generation oh my lord it's getting worse and worse and worse things are happening now that you would have never even in 10 years ago wouldn't have imagined what's going on in this world right now amen so we're ready to get out of here let's don't put our stock on everything on the earth all right it's okay like i said last night it's good to have a job it's good to be well educated it's good to have nice things but don't build a kingdom on it you're building on sinking sand you build the kingdom from above if you put god first he'll give you all these other things amen second timothy 2 19 says nevertheless the foundation of god standeth sure having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of christ depart from iniquity depart from iniquity but in a great house there's not only vessels of gold and silver but wood and earth and some to honor and some to dishonor if a man therefore purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor sanctified and meet for the master's use and prepared unto every good work now remember that's just sanctification and like i said before we're going to read it in a minute he'll give you a new spirit a new spirit to what get along with him get along with yourself questions and answers i'm going to skip through this real quick but everybody knows we know that judas was part of the ministry of jesus christ now watch judas was sanctif was justified by faith and believed on the lord jesus christ and was baptized sounded pretty good didn't it he got started right he got started right he didn't have a trinitarian doctrine to get rid of or uh father son of holy ghost baptism he was born he was baptized right into the body on earth he wasn't baptized in the body of christ he was baptized on the body on earth everybody with me the 12 disciples and believed on the lord jesus christ was baptized john 17 17 before he could send them out he said sanctify them father through thy truth thy word is truth and he was the word even before the atonement was made in other words as a preview father my shed blood i sanctify these he gave them power against unclean spirits and they went out and cast out devils look at that they're doing they're doing supposedly what everybody else is doing they're casting out devils and healing the sick they were rejoicing jumping shouting praising god even the devil's subject to us jesus said don't you rejoice because the devil subject to you but rejoice because your names are written in the book of heaven is that right and judas was one of them called out sanctified his name written in the lamb's book of life not the eternal section read matthew 10 and see if that's not right he called each one of them and judas and every one of them right down there he sent them out give them power against unclean spirit the prophet of god tells us in a hidden light it says how the thing was refreshed in the presence watch this notice another thing once in the presence of god you get quieted you're not talked about now he don't mean quiet like y'all are your spirit gets quieted you're not tossed about by everything some little something pops up you know how to take care of it some of something pops up you don't have to take care of you got a big old support group big support group and man that'll help you out you know where you're standing there something happens i want to ask you a question has something happened in your life that something got to happen not that you just walked into this and appeared in the message there's something has to happen you know that you're a real christian you know that you've been in contact with somebody that's capital s somebody that loves you you know that something's happened down here yes and it's refreshing and not only you but it refreshes others like we were just talking about being salty then you see he said you've seen people that are nice but you don't stand to be around them let's continue on he's you're a little creator now watch this is where we talk about sanctification he said he'd give you a new spirit now that spirit isn't god's spirit we've read this before but i think it we need to catch this you know what the bible says try the spirit have you ever tried yours have you ever tried your spirit to see if it'd be in the face because there's something we got that ain't hello somebody don't get quiet on me now have you tried your spirit try that spirit to see if it's of god to see if it's of the household of faith make sure that that's not an unholy spirit that's trying to act holy you know how to do that try it with the word the word says come to church where it says read your bible the word says study the word says do this and that and the other if you're not doing that get born again now that spirit isn't god's spirit that's your spirit god gives you a new spirit then he says i'll put my spirit in him but the thing god has to do is give you a new spirit make your nature now look he said a little more gentle and say gentle because you're still not born again when he gives you this new spirit everybody with me this is still in sanctification this is cleaned and set aside for service this is cleaning you up so that god because remember when god enters your soul there can't be one speck of sin absolutely there can't be one speck of you left over or you just divorced the devil you didn't kill him everybody with me and you can't be married to two husbands at the same time but the thing god has to do is give you a new spirit make your nature a little more gentle what's it doing it's heading you in the right direction it's putting you in contact with god not in contact with the world or he couldn't even live with you so he has to get you fixed up i like i like profit he's just as country as a cornbread he gets you fixed up that didn't come from a seminary i'm sure them guys in the seminars are just looking there with their eyes crossing this i don't know nothing no that guy knew it a lot more than they did so he's got to get you fixed up first before he can come in i'll give you a new spirit then you take him anywhere you go all kinds of places he's got to get you fixed up so you can entertain him right now how do you entertain the devil is by having the devil inside of you how do you entertain god it's by having the spirit of god inside of you amen but so when you're on the first altar that's when you're on the first altar but when you hide away you get his spirit now that's we're talking about the holy spirit down at the bottom of the pyramid that's when you receive the holy ghost that's when you become a son or daughter of god that's when you become heirs and joint heirs with christ that's when you become into the family of god everybody with me then the holy spirit none other than god himself comes and dwells in you and then there's something about you the neighbors love you the people likes you in travail 1956. he's talking about ezekiel and all that now a lot of people even you pentecostal people a lot of times got mistaken in that you get a new spirit that's not god's spirit that's you that isn't god you get a little happy because you got a new spirit and you jump up down run around over the floor maybe and shout a little bit and speak with tongs and run around a little bit he's speaking to pentecostals he's burning their hide they just don't know it he's taking he's he's a master surgeon he's cutting them with that surgeon's blade and they don't even know what they're doing because they're probably going yeah yeah we know that brother baby and run around a bit a little bit and think you got the holy ghost that's not it that's a new spirit god gave you that's you then after he gives you your spirit then he said i'll put my spirit then what's the matter with this missed meal cramps you know what he's talking about there's another southern expression how many of you be the big old bowl of collards you get the cramps do i need to draw you a picture have you ever eat something it made your stomach cramp and then you know what happens afterwards nobody with me that's what he's saying you getting your stomach mixed up and eating all this junk food you're getting the cramps the pentecostals are we're eating what the wrong food and getting cramps okay i'll draw it out next time that's the reason you can't get nowhere with god listen if you get the cramps you're not going on a long vacation you're not going on an hour drive in your car now notice i hope that's clear now that's why but that's what brother i'm talking about miss meal crabs mess me and it's mess miss meal cramps you get today they missed a few meals but what they eat was wrong that's the reason you can't get nowhere with god that's the reason we can't get nowhere with god it's eating the wrong food notice you put a new spirit god has to give you a new spirit or you couldn't even get along with him you can't get along with yourself that old devil spirit you had in you so he's got to put a new spirit in you so you can get along with his spirit amen i'll put a new spirit in them and i will put my spirit in them and he said after he's given you a new spirit that's you don't get it confused with god's spirit it's not it's your new spirit so you can get along with the holy spirit if he ever gives it to you well i thought was born with this eternal seed i didn't know we needed if he ever don't give me anything no listen if you were some eternal something why are we going through all this all these stages why are we going through justification why are we going through sanctification why are we even reading these quotes if you just always this thing just popped up out of you and it just started growing only in the mind of god were you a seed and what is the seed the word the word was planted in your heart by some preacher by some listening to a tape by some evangelist and if they preach that you just you know you're just always eternal and you got this great spirit and all this stuff i i just don't see that that's a missed meal cramp to me you're not going to get anywhere you're not going you're not going to go you're not here for the long haul we got to be here for the long haul amen it's your new spirit so you can get along with the holy spirit if he ever gives it to you amen because you and your condition never get along you can't get along with your wife you can't get along with your husband you can't get along with your neighbor how are you ever going to get along with god so how so he has to give you a new spirit for that's before you can get along with him so he puts a new spirit in you and then he puts his spirit in you gives you a new spirit a new outlook a new faith then he puts his holy spirit in you so let's just make sure that we're not at sanctification and nowhere else let's let's go on to perfection let's go on to the baptism of the holy ghost let's go on to make sure that that that thing doesn't just burn the unclean spirit out of your spirit realm it burns that unclean spirit out of your soul the thing that's attached to that that old adamic nature that oh brother brown calls it a cloudy it's just it's it's smutty it stuck to you because of what adam and eve did everybody with me on that y'all quiet this morning you're quiet this morning amen okay that's exactly the truth baptism of the holy spirit thomas that wasn't funny okay so it was all right so let's look at the holy ghost just for a minute i know we background some but we just we'll get we'll get a little bit further later on because we got to get the holy ghost before we have the virtues you can have part of them working in your life but you can't have the full virtue of god working through you without having something to come in quicken and pass out paul couldn't preach that without already having him brother brown had to come to a place 30 years to preach that message that you perfect man because i believe he came to a place you said prophet to god oh please he learned just like jesus learned by the things he suffered so did brother brown them he was he had his revelation was progressing all the time because he was a human mortal man he wasn't just somebody that god just dumped everything on him and said this is it william brown i'm uh just go out there and preach 30 or 40 years and don't change a bit now there's certain things that he didn't change but there are certain things that he did everybody that's another another sermon for another day does he preach the white horse rider was the holy ghost in the 50s and then when god revealed to him that the holy ghost that the white horse rider was the antichrist he grew in grace and knowledge all right everybody all right with that so when he grew in grace and knowledge he was coming up to a place to where god said okay preach that sermon right there remember he was sitting down i love that what he tells he's sitting down he's supposed to be hunting squirrels lays his gun over to the side he's sitter sitting down at the bottom of that big old tree he's got a little pad of paper and a pencil and he said this is what come to me and he built that statue of a perfect man that drawing and how that faith virtue knowledge and all the scriptures that tied into it and then remember he said he got up and he had a pentecostal revival going around around that tree why because god had put things together for him that he'd probably never seen remember he brother brown said himself he said i didn't preach on hell hello i didn't preach on hell not being eternal until god showed it to me progressive revelation so listen what are you saying brother there's there's some things we may not see but just keep persevering keep pushing through brother brown didn't say oh my lord i'm so wrong i'm just going to quit preaching no he said thank you god that you've revealed it to me and i can give it to your people first peter once is seeing you purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently that's with fire being born again not a corruptible seed because that's what you were born of the first time your first birth was wrong your first birth is what your problem was or you wouldn't need a rebirth you were born of corruptable seed between your mom and daddy that was allowed by god to get you here so that you can make a choice have you made yours yet you better decide real quick the deciding time's about over being born again not a corruptable seed but of incorruptible by the word of god how were you born again by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever for all flesh is grass and all the glory of man is the flower of grass the grass withereth and the flower therefore fadeth away but but the word of the lord endureth forever amen and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you what i've been trying for 40 sermons to get us see that you must be born again because you know what that was the sermon of the son of man you must be born again the kingdom of heaven is at hand you must be born again and no one was born again while he was here so what did he do he got he got the revelation from the father and he gave it to the people and then on the day of pentecost they began to be born his children his real children ephesians 1 verse 10 says then in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one that's why i said there's only one message we'll read it tonight or this afternoon the bible says one faith one lord amen and one baptism now the scripture's lying if there's two baptisms laying in the scripture one faith one lord one baptism all right we'll talk look at it this afternoon but he's going to gather together in one all things where not william branham not in a message but the message to me the message is christ and in that it entails a lot of things because he wants us to continue to grow he just don't want us to say i believe in the lord jesus christ because the bible says and thou shalt be saved no there's got to be somebody that lives what he's talking about there's got to be somebody that manifests romans 8 says we're waiting on the manifestation of the sons of god not a manifestation of william branham not a manifestation of the lord jesus but a manifestation of the lord jesus through the prophet of god into me and you and we reflect back to lord jesus christ that's what he's looking for he's looking for himself and it's been so muddled so mismilled down through the church ages and so mismilled in this message where they teach this and teach that and teach the other and people get mad at each other for this mad at each other for that grievousness but the bible says gather together all things one in christ all things both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him and him also we have what obtained an inheritance all right what is our inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him he worketh all things after the council of his own will that we should be dwight to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ and whom also you have trusted look after that you heard the word of truth you got to hear the word of truth first before you can come to a knowledge that that is truth and that's error when you come to the age of accountability what do you come to you come to a place that your body and your psychological part of you your brain and your spirit says that's right and that's wrong everybody with me on that and now every day we do the same thing is that right or is that wrong but you've got that spiritual rudder inside of you now that says no that's wrong go this way when we were in the world we never had that what'd we do oh that's nice i think i'll go that way but whom also you trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation your salvation and him also look after that you believe so you had to what hear the word read your bible start coming to church get a new spirit everybody with me you get a new spirit that spirit says read the word of god throw the magazines away or don't magazine anymore quit watching this and quit doing this quit doing you're shaving that off at sanctification that's why i said don't don't base you got the new birth because you don't smoke anymore don't base your uh your your salve don't brace your new birth on that well i read that message and it really it really did me some good well we'll see if you got the new birth you're just reading the newspaper if you don't have the new birth you just read the newspaper but with the new birth you read the love letter amen god never intended for us to read the bible like a newspaper it's revealed to babe such and we'll learn we'll read that tonight after that you believed after that you heard the word of truth after that you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession so there's there's a peace or a part amen the down payment then you got to make your payments right right until the redemption of what the purchased possession what did he possess at calvary not only your soul he possessed and and brought your body under subjection if you'll just let it he purchased every bit of that at calvary purchase your body your spirit and your soul we just know that the first inlet is god working in the soul because he's a spiritual being everybody with me on the day of pentecost he was a spiritual being son of god went into those groups of people burn out the old dynamic nature burn out the old nature they had and put his nature inside of them everybody with me and that's how the church got started that's how the bride got started well guess what we come over here in the end time and they try to change it oh just believe brother i was a prophet oh just believe this seed was in you you got to do just like they did you got to go through justification you got to go through sanctification and you said well i don't really know you better start praying because you're going to have to know that you know that you know quit messing around with god he's long suffering sister gail always said god's long his arm but arm is long but it's got an end his arm may go way out under but there's an end to it like about the bottom of a barrel you say well that barrel's deep it's deep but it's got a bottom to it amen so same thing with god he's long suffering but you know one day he was long suffering in the days of noah the bible says but there was a time when he shut the door i've had enough i'm done there's nobody else going to believe me they're sealed in lock the door and whatever happens outside you've made your choice that's what we're going to be doing now in the end time we're going to have to make our choice to stand with god or you're going to be took by the devil brother ramsay you get caught in that system and not even know it if you know if you're born again you won't you'll get confused probably god tells us but you won't ever go back in that system if you get born again that's the spirit of god that's not the spirit that's not just like that spirit that god gave you to get along with yourself john 14 verse 15 says if you love me if you love me keep my commandments one more time if you love me keep my commandments and that's not filial love that's agape love that's him talking back to himself that's what agape love is video love is like this if you don't like me i ain't gonna like you but what's agape love i'm gonna love you anyway regardless if you hate me i'm gonna love you anyway amen we all know feel your love is conditional y'all know that come on amen i'm gonna make you say amen because it is sorry if you love me keep my commandments if you come to the new birth you've got to keep my commandments because that is the commandment and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that may abide with you forever even the spirit of some truth oh them's big letters even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you shall know him for he shall dwell with you and in you not just with you in you and listen when something dwells inside of you it possesses you when you have a devil inside of you it possesses you right there's a possession well guess what there's a possession in god if he possesses you he's got you you're all wrapped up in him and you will do his commandments i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you i'll stop right here yet a little while in the world save me no more but you'll see me because i live you shall live also and at that day you shall know that i am in the father and ye and me and i and you let's read this one and then we'll close first corinthians three verse one said i brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but carnal even as unto babes in christ i have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto you were not able to bury we don't like to choke little kids do we no because you were not able to bear it neither yet now are you able for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envy and strife what demons devils in your spirit realm that is making you do these things carnal strife division are you not carnal and walk as men first peter 2 1 let's musicians come wherefore laying aside all malice all gown all hypocrisy lay aside envies and all evil speaking as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word what that you may grow thereby that you may grow up in god if so be that you have what tasted that the lord is gracious let's stand to our feet wherefore i give you to understand that no man speaketh by the spirit of god calleth jesus a curse and that no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost because you will be confused simon peter servant apostle jesus christ to them that what have obtained obtained now when you go to a store you go to a store to buy groceries they don't just appear in your house you got to go obtain them that's why i said about this salvation you got to go get it you got to go you got to make a move you got to make a move for god remember he said draw nine to me i'll draw nine to you you got to meet him in the middle to them have to obtain like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ bless you and peace and grace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge look multiplied everything is ongoing god's just not flatlining he wants everything to be moving motion and of jesus our lord according us what his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain to what life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue he's called us to these virtues that we're gonna start talking about he's made a call okay you're born again okay you're my children okay you've been running around long enough it's time to get serious it's time to let whatever's inside of you out have you heard that before i only say that about 12 times a day let it out one way or the other and that by these we're by our given unto what given given unto us exceeding great and precious promises but that by what these these promises you might be what partakers of the divine nature you got to partake of the divine nature of god having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this besides what we've talked this whole sermon about being justified sanctified filled with the holy ghost being a child of god a son and daughter of god heading toward adoption and besides this giving all diligence ed add all diligence add yes but brother wait i got everything i need for my journey so is your little kid got everything in his body to drive with but you're not gonna give him the keys at five years

last night in the bible study he said why are we preparing so much for this life you're only going to live about 70 or 80 years some of some are going to get more sister clayton sister sister gwen some are going to get a little bit more time but some are not why not let's work on that kingdom over there that's eternal we know what's inside of us by the new birth so let's start building that thing inside of us for that next part of our journey you know everybody says oh well some people say well brother john we're just gonna vapor away you know we're just gonna as soon as we die we're gone some says we're gonna stay in the grave soul sleeping with the body and we're gonna stay there until time of judgment thank god god sent us a prophet and said when you pass from this you're going into that sixth dimension where there's nothing but bliss perfection [Music] and nothing's gonna harm you nothing's gonna they made a preparation like i said before it's okay to prepare things it's okay to prepare to get married or or to have a new job or that's okay but if that consumes your whole being then it's not of god but if you let god consume your being and then do the other things i
