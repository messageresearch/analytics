[0:00] hundred years before our lord jesus was
[0:02] born the prophet isaiah said
[0:06] therefore the lord himself shall give
[0:08] you a sign behold avoi a virgin shall
[0:11] conceive and bear a son and shall call
[0:14] his name emmanuel
[0:16] this was fulfilled through the faith of
[0:19] a message believer named mary when the
[0:22] angel gabriel was sent from god and said
[0:25] hail thou art
[0:28] highly favored the lord is with thee
[0:31] blessed art thou among women and behold
[0:35] thou shalt conceive in thy room and
[0:37] bring forth the son and shalt
[0:39] call his name jesus
[0:41] and mary said behold the handmaid of the
[0:44] lord be it unto me according to thy word
[0:48] and the angel departed from her
[0:50] and the word was made flesh
[0:53] among us
[0:54] full of grace and truth

[10:16] amen
[10:18] all right romans
[10:21] 8
[10:22] 28
[10:24] for we know that all things work
[10:25] together for good to them that love god
[10:28] to them who are thee called according to
[10:30] his purpose
[10:31] for whom he did for no he also did
[10:33] predestinate
[10:35] what to be conformed to the image of his
[10:37] son that he might be the firstborn among
[10:40] many brethren
[10:41] moreover whom he did predestinate
[10:44] them he also called and whom he called
[10:46] he them he also justified in them and
[10:49] whom he justified them he also glorified
[10:52] what shall we then say to these things
[10:56] if god be for us who can be against us
[10:59] how can we fail
[11:02] it's impossible for a christian to
[11:04] fail
[11:05] we're going to
[11:06] be there and it'll be right okay
[11:08] ephesians
[11:09] 1 starting with verse 7
[11:13] in whom we have redemption through his
[11:14] blood
[11:16] the forgiveness of sins according to the
[11:17] riches of his grace
[11:19] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[11:21] all wisdom and prudence
[11:23] having made known unto us the mystery of
[11:25] his will
[11:26] according to his good pleasure which he
[11:28] has purposed in himself
[11:31] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[11:33] of times he might gather together
[11:36] in one all things in christ both which
[11:39] are in heaven
[11:40] and which are on earth even in him in
[11:43] whom also we have obtained an
[11:45] inheritance
[11:46] being predestinated according to the
[11:48] purpose of him who worketh all things
[11:50] after the council of his own will
[11:53] that we should be to the praise of his
[11:54] glory he first trusted in christ
[11:57] in whom he also trusted after that you
[12:00] heard the word of truth
[12:02] the gospel of your salvation in whom
[12:04] also after that you believed you were
[12:06] sealed
[12:08] with that now notice it says with that
[12:10] why didn't it say with thee
[12:13] it's emphasizing it see with that
[12:16] holy spirit of promise which is the
[12:19] earnest of our inheritance what until
[12:21] the redemption of the purchase
[12:23] possession
[12:24] unto the praise of his glory you may be
[12:26] seated the lord that is blessing to the
[12:28] reading of the word
[12:30] now
[12:31] what i want to do this afternoon is
[12:36] is just
[12:37] they don't have not one you won't be
[12:39] reading not one quote
[12:41] so that's pretty good i told them
[12:42] they're gonna give them vacation
[12:44] they don't have to fight in there and
[12:46] try to get everything to go and i ain't
[12:48] saying i won't quote a lot i'm saying i
[12:50] won't give we won't have but one quote
[12:53] i mean but one reading up there and that
[12:55] was the reading of the scriptures
[12:57] because what i want to do is just kind
[12:59] of
[13:00] go back and review down
[13:03] to where we are maybe make a little uh
[13:07] speaking of
[13:08] you know
[13:09] uh future things but not much on that
[13:13] because then we will start the lord
[13:15] willing
[13:16] the next service
[13:18] and we'll start in
[13:20] because i want to go from here from
[13:22] before the foundation world down to
[13:23] jesus christ especially
[13:26] make a few more comments but yet mainly
[13:28] stop there
[13:30] and and see about this because we're
[13:32] going to call it the plan of redemption
[13:35] you know we're still dealing with
[13:38] how does god predestinate this is
[13:40] message 43 on it
[13:42] but we're going to talk about the plan
[13:44] of redemption
[13:46] revealed now to remember what we were
[13:49] talking about this morning
[13:54] if something is not revealed it's still
[13:56] just letters on a page
[13:58] all right even though we can quote it by
[14:00] memory i remember brother moat and them
[14:02] brother george and him
[14:04] years ago
[14:05] um they uh
[14:07] was talking to a man that
[14:09] they you know
[14:11] they got into the one god doctrine and
[14:13] this man came that was a trinitarian
[14:16] well he he wanted
[14:18] he wanted to talk to them well he could
[14:20] quote the bible
[14:23] totally by memory
[14:25] you know i mean
[14:27] he was a smart man and i appreciate that
[14:29] that was that was good
[14:30] but yet he was a trinitarian
[14:33] and uh
[14:34] but
[14:35] see this the simplicity of
[14:38] of asking him a few questions once he
[14:40] got into the discussion as i said
[14:43] until the man wound up to him they would
[14:45] say
[14:47] what is his name
[14:50] and he'd say rosa sharon you know he's
[14:53] he's passing it off they said no no call
[14:55] his name
[14:57] because they were showing him water
[14:58] baptism see in the name of the lord
[14:59] jesus christ
[15:01] and they were dealing with you know the
[15:03] name there in matthew 28
[15:05] and
[15:07] he said the man never would call the
[15:08] name jesus
[15:10] because he said because see if he'd
[15:11] called it then they had him where they
[15:13] wanted to talk to him
[15:14] and and they were in no capability in
[15:18] the category he was in as far as
[15:19] intellectual understanding
[15:21] but yet they had asked some simple
[15:23] questions that he couldn't answer right
[15:27] you see if you have a revelation you
[15:29] don't have to worry
[15:31] right
[15:32] i don't i don't have no fear about
[15:33] what's been revealed to me
[15:36] and you asked me a question about
[15:37] something not been real i'll just tell
[15:38] you and i don't have any problem saying
[15:40] i don't know
[15:42] that's no problem just say i don't know
[15:44] i have questions about the bible and why
[15:46] it would state certain ways and do
[15:49] but i know and realize that's my problem
[15:52] it's not god's problem because he said
[15:54] it right
[15:55] well i just have to keep waiting until
[15:57] he'll come on the scene somewhere and
[16:00] put it together and
[16:01] he may use a little
[16:03] somebody you know i told you about
[16:05] sister birds that time when she said
[16:07] well he was god all the time and i said
[16:09] well i wish i'd let you preach
[16:11] because i spent an hour and a half
[16:12] trying to prove he was god and she said
[16:14] he was just god all the time
[16:16] well that was just
[16:17] an uneducated person but yet speaking by
[16:20] revelation
[16:22] all right and see if something's
[16:23] revealed
[16:26] it's good we're listening last night
[16:28] i'm pretty sure
[16:30] that one
[16:31] brother random was talking about said
[16:32] you can know the letter of the word
[16:35] you know you you can memorize it
[16:38] you can know the letter of it
[16:40] but he said if it's not revealed
[16:43] see then then what is it it's laying
[16:46] there waiting for the revelation
[16:48] it's wonderful to study and pray and
[16:50] seek god
[16:52] but
[16:53] to uh
[16:54] remember brother tom talking about a man
[16:56] that
[16:56] was trying to memorize the bible and he
[16:58] would run a bulldozer he said he would
[17:01] read a scripture
[17:02] get off and go do something but he's
[17:04] quoting that scripture all the time he's
[17:05] gone just trying to memorize it well i'm
[17:08] honest and i'm sorry
[17:09] i've never tried to memorize the bible
[17:13] if you had to depend on me to quote the
[17:16] lord's prayer i would probably quote it
[17:18] wrong
[17:20] because there is like two or three ways
[17:22] to say some things you know
[17:25] in one place that'll be one group will
[17:27] be in
[17:28] and
[17:29] but i've never tried to memorize the
[17:31] bible
[17:33] i just read it
[17:35] and and i depend upon him to speak to me
[17:39] to reveal it to me because it's not how
[17:42] much i know
[17:43] it's who i know
[17:45] all right see then in revelation we were
[17:47] talking about this morning
[17:49] that's the greatest thing we need a
[17:50] revelation more than anything
[17:52] because by revelation the gates of hell
[17:54] cannot prevail against us
[17:56] all right and you say well boy bless god
[17:58] ain't prevailing it's me well you're
[17:59] still living
[18:01] no death is still taking you
[18:04] and everything lord we just
[18:06] you know i heard out there today that
[18:08] brother
[18:09] uh
[18:10] everybody even announcing doors to
[18:12] tidwell and just passed away this past
[18:15] week i didn't know that
[18:17] but see the people are just
[18:20] gradually dying off but why because
[18:23] we're getting older
[18:25] and you know time lies
[18:27] and you're not going to die off
[18:29] so and the ones that are looking at and
[18:30] saying i'll never die you're going to be
[18:32] as old as we are
[18:34] and it's a lot of fun all right
[18:37] but now listen
[18:40] we started out we we took the plan of
[18:42] salvation
[18:44] or the plan of redemption talking about
[18:47] how does god predestinate
[18:49] we went back before the foundation of
[18:51] the world
[18:52] because that's the only way you can do
[18:54] with it we went back there and we spent
[18:57] quite a while talking about
[18:59] how does god predestinate
[19:01] the prophet said he predestinates
[19:03] by for knowledge
[19:06] all right so which comes first
[19:08] predestination or foreknowledge
[19:11] if your predestination comes first what
[19:12] do you need for knowledge
[19:15] right
[19:16] you're wasting your time
[19:18] but if you've got four knowledge
[19:20] then you can predestinate
[19:22] what the destiny will be
[19:24] all right and we found that
[19:30] god does not
[19:31] predestinate by his own desires
[19:35] because he desired that everybody be
[19:37] saved all right
[19:39] then desiring everybody to be saved he
[19:42] can't make us lost
[19:45] then condemn us for being lost right
[19:49] but he knew when he made us
[19:52] that if he gave us free moral agency
[19:56] that we would fall
[19:59] all right now most of these things you
[20:01] know that have listened to the series
[20:04] i'm actually quoting service after
[20:06] service and these are quotes from
[20:08] brother ranum so if you need something
[20:11] call me i'll be glad to
[20:12] let you know where it's at
[20:15] all right
[20:16] then
[20:19] he couldn't make us lost
[20:23] and be just
[20:24] and condemn us
[20:26] but by knowing what we would do so we
[20:29] knew
[20:30] jacob would
[20:32] be what he would be he knew that a saul
[20:34] would be what he would be
[20:36] so he could say before they were either
[20:38] one born
[20:41] jacob he loved and he saw he hated
[20:44] all right before they were ever born
[20:46] now but you remember one thing
[20:52] i like it this way you know
[20:57] had he not given esau an opportunity
[21:04] see then look where he would be
[21:07] so we can't just say well he just
[21:09] predetermined it
[21:12] no he looked down and saw what they
[21:15] would do
[21:17] their desires and their things
[21:20] and yet he deals with people like we
[21:22] went through the series of studying on
[21:25] how that he even dealt with
[21:27] cain
[21:29] and said cain would you not been
[21:31] received the prophet said he would have
[21:33] been received
[21:35] had he not turned against him
[21:38] all right
[21:39] so then we got to look at predestination
[21:41] as a destiny set yeah but to look and
[21:45] see that it's by
[21:46] for
[21:47] knowledge
[21:50] because that way then
[21:52] we don't have to worry about it
[21:54] that way it's not say well
[21:56] you know i i i just
[21:59] i don't know i was talking to somebody
[22:00] the other day and they said just talking
[22:02] to a person
[22:03] without living in the world and said but
[22:05] if i'm predestinated
[22:08] i'll be there
[22:11] now that's what we think
[22:13] that's a good old baptist
[22:15] you know one of these days something
[22:16] will happen
[22:18] and i'll get saved
[22:19] well
[22:20] now
[22:22] i don't look at it that way
[22:25] i believe our lives are supposed to
[22:26] prove what we are
[22:29] right the way we live
[22:31] shows whether or not we're predestinated
[22:33] right brother tom farbush had a good
[22:35] west daily
[22:36] he said you
[22:37] trigger your predestination
[22:41] see then you've got all the way through
[22:42] the scripture like
[22:44] you know what the
[22:46] uh heart man believeth unto
[22:48] righteousness with the mouth confessions
[22:49] made under salvation well what if you've
[22:51] never done that
[22:55] it's in the word
[22:58] if we'd never done it look where we'd be
[23:01] but then we were talking about that then
[23:02] we came down to the garden and we won't
[23:04] spend that much time in the dealings and
[23:06] we won't go through the
[23:08] the part in the garden other than one
[23:10] thing
[23:12] god knew
[23:14] if he put us here
[23:16] we would go wrong
[23:18] all right
[23:20] knowing that then
[23:22] as quick as man went wrong
[23:27] you know adam and eve in the garden
[23:30] then he immediately
[23:33] made the atonement
[23:36] by killing the animals
[23:38] and putting the skin on them
[23:40] all right
[23:42] showing that what he was going to do
[23:44] he wasn't going to throw him away
[23:49] had he just went on and killed it look
[23:50] what it would have been
[23:52] even somebody we were talking outside
[23:54] one day made a good point
[23:55] or somebody was talking to me recently
[23:58] the if he had allowed adam to have
[24:01] killed cain
[24:03] that would have ended
[24:04] all knowledge of the beast
[24:06] and all of the things so he didn't even
[24:08] allow that
[24:10] he actually took care of him
[24:12] to make sure that everything would work
[24:13] out
[24:14] because it's got to be here all
[24:16] right but when it come into mankind then
[24:22] we see that he not only had a plan
[24:25] his plan and purpose was not only to
[24:28] just cover
[24:30] the sins
[24:32] you know
[24:33] with the atonement
[24:35] but that he was
[24:37] come immediately and say
[24:39] and i'll put enmity between thy seed and
[24:41] the seed of the woman
[24:43] promising the coming messiah
[24:46] to redeem
[24:49] not to just atone
[24:51] a tone is great wonderful thing
[24:55] yet all the way down to that old
[24:56] testament
[24:58] that atonement would just cover
[25:01] but it could not be
[25:03] redeemed
[25:05] but we want to see down to there
[25:08] that redemption was spoke of all right
[25:12] supplying the atonement
[25:15] covered to sin
[25:19] but the promise of the redeemer
[25:25] would
[25:26] be greater all right then that's
[25:29] remember we went through it we're
[25:30] talking about it we're brought around
[25:31] and said that
[25:33] god told adam going out of the garden
[25:36] the love of
[25:38] god for mankind
[25:40] because adam was going out of the garden
[25:41] he said but i'll put enmity between that
[25:43] he promised to see to the woman
[25:46] all right
[25:47] and when he did
[25:49] he said i'll go with you
[25:52] now that may not mean anything to you
[25:54] but it means a whole lot to me
[25:57] when he would say i'll go with you
[26:01] i'll not leave you and when i read that
[26:03] one day of the prophet he said
[26:05] that god just came down
[26:08] and busied himself with the children of
[26:10] israel
[26:12] even though they were constantly doing
[26:14] wrong
[26:17] and i showed you time after time the
[26:19] bible said they sinned 10 times
[26:22] between leaving egypt and cadence barney
[26:25] never did god say i'm not going to let
[26:27] you go
[26:28] but when they come to cadiz barnea
[26:31] and rejected
[26:32] the fact that god could do it
[26:37] he said you're not going
[26:40] see that becomes sin which is unbelief
[26:43] because we know that's what happened
[26:44] with eve in the garden right
[26:48] eve disbelieved god brother brown said
[26:50] even the fact that she doubted hebrews
[26:52] 13 8.
[26:55] that he's the same yesterday today and
[26:57] forever
[26:59] but see then
[27:01] by god
[27:02] saying what he said
[27:04] he had to make a way
[27:07] to redeem
[27:10] now had he i'm just plainly saying it
[27:12] and he stayed in the garden
[27:15] it wouldn't work
[27:17] so he came
[27:18] out to go with mankind
[27:23] and prepare away
[27:25] all right
[27:27] now what i want us to look at
[27:30] is that
[27:31] we talk about that seed of the woman
[27:36] the promise of the coming messiah
[27:39] okay a redeemer
[27:41] to redeem mankind
[27:44] during the time of the atonement in the
[27:47] old testament
[27:50] what they would do
[27:52] could only speak of
[27:54] top it
[27:56] shadow it
[27:58] that would not come forth as the
[28:02] redeemer you know into full being
[28:05] all right they would only speak of it
[28:07] every time they take an animal up and
[28:08] kill it it would speak of the coming of
[28:10] messiah okay
[28:12] now
[28:14] but in doing that
[28:17] we can follow that throughout the
[28:19] scriptures
[28:22] the promised messiah
[28:25] the redeemer
[28:27] that was promised
[28:30] the seed of the woman
[28:31] that was promised
[28:34] all right
[28:35] we see in noah
[28:38] now let's just take a run through the
[28:39] bible just real quick
[28:43] we see in noah
[28:47] was a promise of an ark to come
[28:51] and carry the people over the flood
[28:54] a redeemer if you might say right
[28:58] a perpetuation made
[29:00] that's more than just offering an
[29:02] offering
[29:04] a way would be made
[29:06] to save mankind
[29:09] if you just get in the ark all right
[29:12] and he was given free moral agency
[29:16] right
[29:18] and they decided to get in the ark
[29:21] look what it would have been
[29:25] but now god didn't somebody asked me the
[29:27] other day how big the ark would i never
[29:29] have figured that out feet i don't know
[29:31] i just say it's a couple of football
[29:33] fields along with half of one wide or
[29:34] something
[29:35] i don't really know
[29:38] but you know what
[29:40] if it was a world like today then
[29:42] there's about 7 billion people in the
[29:44] world today
[29:46] suppose that world was to that degree
[29:50] and what about eight people is all
[29:53] seven really beside him believing his
[29:55] own message
[29:58] but see i believe god could have built a
[30:00] ship
[30:01] big enough to cure everybody
[30:05] right
[30:07] mean it wouldn't matter how long it had
[30:09] to be or how big it had to be
[30:12] you said well i don't know well they had
[30:13] 120 years to build it
[30:16] i mean i i i i've done a little carton
[30:18] of work but i have back there it's
[30:20] grinning because he has and he'd say
[30:22] well i started on a house well how long
[30:24] you been 120 years
[30:27] you're a slow carpenter
[30:30] you know i mean
[30:32] brother daniel
[30:34] he just he built one about a year ago or
[30:35] something well you just don't spend 20
[30:38] years building on a house now unless you
[30:40] live in jamaica
[30:41] we laughed in jamaica because right next
[30:43] to brother reed
[30:44] for years of us going over there
[30:47] you'd look at it and it was just a
[30:49] foundation
[30:50] you go back
[30:52] to the years and there might be walls up
[30:54] and then finally they'd be up and then
[30:56] finally they got a roof on the thing but
[30:58] they were doing it according to they
[30:59] could afford it but you know they did
[31:00] get a roof on it they didn't get a house
[31:02] done but see 120 years
[31:06] noah could have built an ark
[31:08] big enough to carry the whole world
[31:11] if the whole world was going to go
[31:14] all right
[31:15] now
[31:18] my point is
[31:19] what
[31:21] about god's foreknowledge
[31:25] he knew
[31:27] now i'm going to try to approach this in
[31:28] the best way that i can
[31:30] he knew that it was only going to be
[31:34] noah his wife
[31:36] three kids and their wives
[31:40] there's no list of grandkids
[31:42] there's just eight souls right
[31:45] now he knew that
[31:48] now i'm honest
[31:50] i've always liked to look at things
[31:52] realistically
[31:54] 120 years of knowing preaching you said
[31:56] we only got
[31:58] seven converts well you know there might
[32:01] have been some people that
[32:02] in the beginning that believe noah
[32:06] you don't ever think you know just be
[32:08] sensible
[32:09] there might have been some people that
[32:10] believed it
[32:14] you know what they died before the ark
[32:16] came
[32:18] right
[32:19] because you've got different ones
[32:22] names in there
[32:24] and you've got all of those people
[32:26] coming down
[32:27] from adam
[32:30] down to noah
[32:33] anybody been a lot of people they never
[32:34] believed that brother gary
[32:37] and they said we're looking forward to
[32:39] it
[32:40] they might have been people donated
[32:42] money we'll say it today
[32:44] to help noah
[32:46] all right
[32:50] he said well why would you say it like
[32:52] that
[32:53] because that's what i said 40 some years
[32:55] ago
[32:57] and you know it
[33:00] i said
[33:01] the biggest portion of the people of
[33:02] this message
[33:04] are going to die and go by the grave
[33:07] i said that 40 years ago no he backed up
[33:09] yet
[33:10] he's ah that's just time running out
[33:12] well okay it's just time running out all
[33:13] right it was just something i said but
[33:15] it's true
[33:18] it's not just the old people dying that
[33:20] are following this message a lot of
[33:22] young people die too
[33:24] i'm not going to call them unbelievers
[33:27] what about you
[33:30] well they didn't believe because they
[33:31] died
[33:32] jesus died
[33:36] brother branham died
[33:38] paul died peter died
[33:41] come on get it off you
[33:44] little thoughts of what you think is
[33:45] right
[33:46] and just listen
[33:49] there might have been a lot of people
[33:50] believe noah
[33:52] but they all went by the grave
[33:55] they were left with a little group of
[33:56] people
[33:58] you know why did i believe that
[34:02] because there's going to be a little
[34:03] group of people that's going to walk off
[34:04] this earth that's the end of the message
[34:07] it's going to walk off this earth in a
[34:08] rapture
[34:10] and i'm not going to say all this died
[34:12] before then
[34:14] didn't believe the message
[34:16] i'm just going to say they couldn't make
[34:18] it
[34:19] and if i'm one of them
[34:21] it don't bother me if he's right on my
[34:23] tombstone he didn't make it you know
[34:25] that'll bother me
[34:27] that don't mean i'm not a believer
[34:31] that means time run out with me all
[34:34] right
[34:34] and see that's just the way i think i i
[34:36] don't want to throw nobody just out and
[34:38] just
[34:39] forget it you know
[34:41] but you see noah he come along with a
[34:43] promise
[34:48] he rose up went over come back down but
[34:50] it was a type
[34:53] the ark
[34:54] of christ right
[34:56] right
[34:58] the promise of the messiah
[35:00] you know what he was in that day
[35:04] are you listening yes he was the messiah
[35:09] right
[35:10] the anointed one
[35:12] not the christ that would finally come
[35:16] but he was christ
[35:18] the anointed one all right
[35:22] you jump over to abraham
[35:27] abraham gets a promise
[35:33] he was promised to see to the woman
[35:37] he lived his life and followed as much
[35:38] as he could
[35:41] changed his name all kinds of things
[35:43] happened to him
[35:44] even got a change of the body
[35:47] right
[35:49] which is a type right
[35:52] to you and i
[35:53] right
[35:55] you see
[35:56] he had to promise
[35:59] trying to fulfill
[36:01] of the coming of the messiah
[36:04] for that time
[36:09] are you following me
[36:11] you know one day he did have that child
[36:15] that promise that was there
[36:18] and that promised son was isaac
[36:21] but he only typed the coming of the
[36:23] promised seed but yet he was the top of
[36:26] it
[36:30] so there was a redeemer
[36:34] but not being
[36:37] not being in the
[36:38] completeness he would be
[36:41] a type
[36:44] a shadow
[36:45] something
[36:47] i would jump over to moses
[36:51] moses said brother brown said could even
[36:53] therefore it come to the bases that it
[36:55] was god was fixing to destroy the
[36:57] children of israel and moses rose up and
[36:59] said god if you kill them said you got
[37:02] to come over me in other words you've
[37:03] got to kill me first
[37:06] and brother brown said he was the type
[37:08] of christ
[37:12] he was actually god to the people you
[37:14] remember that
[37:15] aaron was his prophet
[37:17] the bible didn't have any trouble
[37:18] calling him god
[37:20] or saying what he was
[37:23] well why can't we
[37:25] well see he was speaking of the coming
[37:26] messiah
[37:29] and what about a man stand between god
[37:31] and the people
[37:33] now you got many times in there when
[37:34] that would happen i remember one
[37:36] incidence remember and the plague was
[37:38] coming down because of the israelites
[37:40] doing wrong
[37:41] and moses hollered to air and said aaron
[37:44] take the sensor
[37:45] you know go get some cold off the fire
[37:48] and go among the people
[37:51] and make an atonement
[37:54] well
[37:56] you know what that done that spirit
[37:57] israel
[38:00] that redeemed in the basis of stopping
[38:04] the death from coming
[38:07] so noah moses abraham
[38:10] type in christ
[38:13] would be a type of the redeemer
[38:15] or be a type of the seed of the woman
[38:17] which would be christ
[38:19] to come forth
[38:22] what about david
[38:25] what about david being able to kill a
[38:28] lion a bear and a giant
[38:30] all right the line of the buyer was to
[38:33] keep
[38:35] them from eating up his daddy's sheep
[38:38] which we find a tight will
[38:41] but when he killed that giant
[38:44] he was actually the savior of israel
[38:49] right
[38:51] in top he was a redeemer
[38:55] in top he was the seat of the woman
[38:58] there was promise to come
[39:00] if you understand what i'm saying when
[39:02] each one of these come forth
[39:05] and as they manifest the god of their
[39:08] time and their age wherever
[39:10] they would actually be then
[39:13] the coming forth of the
[39:15] seed of the woman
[39:18] does that give any trouble to preach
[39:20] where i did one day it comes down to you
[39:22] and i in this last days
[39:25] that we've got to give birth to jesus
[39:27] christ that's right
[39:29] that shouldn't be any problem when you
[39:30] can look back there and see what they've
[39:31] done
[39:35] what about the judges of israel
[39:38] you know
[39:40] what about samson
[39:44] gave his heart to delilah and gave his
[39:45] body to god
[39:47] you know god used him to
[39:50] redeem israel yes man right
[39:56] think of those things
[39:58] what about gideon
[40:01] man of valor the bible called him
[40:05] yet god used him
[40:09] those judges judged israel
[40:13] but those judges were the redeemers of
[40:15] israel
[40:17] right
[40:18] the protector
[40:20] the the the uh
[40:22] one that would
[40:23] save them from being destroyed
[40:26] even though they would be judged a lot
[40:27] of time and and put into
[40:30] great imprisonments and things
[40:34] but yet
[40:36] he would still speak of
[40:38] like when jeremiah said they were going
[40:40] down there
[40:41] you're going down you're going to ground
[40:43] he said but you're coming back in 40
[40:44] years
[40:49] all right
[40:50] the prophet daniel got down there and he
[40:52] got to looking around and he said by
[40:54] books
[40:55] we're supposed to get out of here
[40:58] by promise
[41:00] that god had made
[41:03] a redeemer would be supplied
[41:07] to come forth
[41:10] what about getting even closer as to
[41:14] the book of ruth
[41:16] where the in the book of ruth you have
[41:19] ruth and boaz and naomi and
[41:21] all of the things
[41:23] the boys wound up being a type of christ
[41:27] ruth is the top of the bride
[41:30] naomi is the type of israel
[41:34] but they would be a redeemer
[41:38] to carry on
[41:40] the lineage of israel
[41:43] are you following me yes
[41:45] all right
[41:47] what about then getting into the many
[41:49] prophecies
[41:52] then we spent a lot of time talking of
[41:54] genesis there were said i'll put enmity
[41:56] between thy seed the seed of the woman a
[41:58] promise
[42:00] but what about isaiah
[42:03] getting so caught up in the spirit
[42:08] until he would
[42:10] say a virgin shall conceive
[42:14] right the seat of the woman was
[42:18] getting closer and closer
[42:20] david brought it to a great thing when
[42:22] he would say
[42:23] they pierced my hands and my feet
[42:27] speaking of the first person
[42:30] isaiah comes down to a
[42:33] directly written
[42:34] word prophecy
[42:38] it's like genesis was a word prophecy
[42:42] you know written in the word
[42:44] not just typing it
[42:48] but actually
[42:49] prophesying
[42:51] of what it would be
[42:54] go through the book of isaiah sometimes
[42:56] when you get a change
[43:00] and look at all the things that he said
[43:04] wrote a complete bible
[43:08] showing it all the way to
[43:10] the future home
[43:13] a prophecy
[43:15] amen
[43:17] then that way looking at the bible and
[43:19] you find the bible the biggest portion
[43:21] of it is prophecy right
[43:23] speaking of the future all right
[43:29] the promise of the coming of the messiah
[43:36] whereas the atonement could just cover
[43:38] sin
[43:41] they couldn't eradicate it
[43:44] now listen to what i'm saying
[43:46] the promise
[43:48] of the messiah
[43:50] could not do away with sin
[43:55] now you're following me
[43:58] i'll put it in between i see the seat of
[43:59] the woman that was wonderful but that
[44:02] could not eradicate sin
[44:06] all the types in the shadows of it
[44:10] all the prophecies all the things of
[44:12] david and his singing they pierced my
[44:14] hands and my feet
[44:18] that couldn't eradicate sin
[44:22] all right
[44:24] then we come to
[44:26] mary
[44:30] you could take many more you could come
[44:31] through
[44:34] promises you could come through like
[44:38] malachi
[44:41] three speaking of the coming of john the
[44:42] baptist
[44:44] four speaking of an end time prophet
[44:47] that would come
[44:48] that we'll get to as we go along in the
[44:50] story
[44:51] later on in the messages a few weeks
[44:53] from now probably
[44:55] but
[44:58] then
[45:00] something's going to take place right
[45:02] what a wonderful promise
[45:06] right
[45:08] i brought around and said i'd rather
[45:10] have a promise from god
[45:14] than all your securities you could give
[45:16] me
[45:17] right
[45:19] i can stand on the promise
[45:22] he spoke to me years ago and said you'll
[45:24] be there with your offspring i said
[45:26] that's my promise
[45:29] he said well he said that to me too well
[45:31] that's your promise
[45:32] that's not mine
[45:34] i'm not going to share mine with you
[45:38] well because i'm not i don't want to get
[45:39] rid of mine
[45:41] i don't want to give you half your
[45:42] family and i'll take a high for mine no
[45:44] you got to have your own
[45:47] brother said if you don't have faith for
[45:48] the others
[45:50] what did he say
[45:53] he said i doubt if you have saved faith
[45:55] for yourself
[45:57] all right that's what i want to hold on
[46:00] all right
[46:01] he gave me many promises but something
[46:04] like that i really love it
[46:08] now going back to what we said this
[46:09] morning
[46:14] that if you can
[46:16] see your name in the book
[46:21] right
[46:24] look at the promises in the book just
[46:26] find yourself
[46:28] i remember brother george canada he used
[46:30] to rejoice about it
[46:32] because he had that scripture and i read
[46:33] it to his funeral
[46:35] blessed is a man
[46:37] whose quiver is full
[46:40] well he said i looked that up one time i
[46:41] never did try to check it i took his
[46:43] word
[46:44] it means seven and
[46:46] he had seven arrows in their quiver
[46:48] well that meant they had seven kids you
[46:50] know
[46:52] and see brother george held on to that
[46:54] well have you ever had a promise
[47:01] i mean something god promised you
[47:06] can just
[47:07] to me that's a revelation that's calling
[47:10] your name
[47:12] you understand what i'm saying this
[47:14] morning the calling your name is the
[47:15] revelation of the hour that's speaking
[47:18] to you
[47:20] how many times i've ever told you this
[47:24] it's a secret of a gift
[47:27] but then you have to know how it works
[47:28] for it to work so you ain't worried
[47:29] about it
[47:32] i've tried to explain something to you
[47:33] about a secret of a gift
[47:37] your family needs saved your children
[47:39] your wife your husband et cetera
[47:42] and you're sitting listening to somebody
[47:44] preaching
[47:46] and that just begins to unfold
[47:50] have you ever done that it just unfolds
[47:53] right in front of you
[47:56] and you just see a picture unfold
[48:00] i've tried to tell you
[48:04] at that time just raise your hand and
[48:05] say
[48:06] my children my husband my wife
[48:11] he said what good is that try and see
[48:16] it just might work
[48:20] see when i'm needing something from god
[48:21] i wait for a revelation to start
[48:23] unfolding
[48:25] and during that revelation i claim
[48:28] what i'm desiring
[48:32] you see one revelation is more important
[48:33] than anything in the world
[48:35] you know why
[48:36] because just for a split second
[48:39] you've done entered eternity when
[48:41] something is revealed to you
[48:45] it may be a split second
[48:48] i've heard people say the lord talked
[48:50] all day to me well i know that i know
[48:52] how it heals but
[48:54] well brother gary's sitting there
[48:55] shaking his head i know what he's
[48:57] talking about
[48:59] sometimes i go for months before he
[49:01] speaks to me about something
[49:03] he'll speak about one thing you know
[49:04] what i do i spend months preaching about
[49:06] that one thing until he speaks to me
[49:08] again
[49:09] you know
[49:12] why because it's a revelation
[49:15] the revelation is eternity
[49:19] now get the point of what i'm saying
[49:21] as each one of those men we talked about
[49:24] in all of the old testament saints
[49:27] it was something personal
[49:29] about them
[49:32] they couldn't conquer the enemy
[49:36] you think
[49:37] samson with a jawbone of an old donkey
[49:39] that would one hit that had been gone
[49:41] and he kills a thousand people
[49:44] even they didn't have the big old thick
[49:46] helmets that right around said inch
[49:47] thick
[49:50] just one or two whacks with an old dead
[49:54] donkey's
[49:55] jawbone
[49:57] it's gone
[50:00] but you see he had a promise
[50:05] they just goofed up with sampson always
[50:07] like that
[50:08] you know he didn't have no eyeballs
[50:12] but why in the world didn't them dummies
[50:14] keep his hair cut off
[50:19] you think about it
[50:24] see that i thought well we got him blind
[50:27] what can he do
[50:32] well brother said he reached back there
[50:33] and feel that her
[50:36] in his life and said he know god was
[50:38] with him
[50:40] that was a promise
[50:42] when he walked in there with that little
[50:44] boy he said
[50:46] well
[50:48] his son just showed me where them two
[50:49] pillars is that
[50:51] i'm sure they had some kind of a big
[50:53] anchors hung into them and
[50:56] you know
[50:57] they probably wasn't 90 feet apart it
[50:59] was pretty close right where he got
[51:00] right in the middle because you'd put
[51:02] them together you know
[51:03] these builders know what i'm talking
[51:05] about because that's your main structure
[51:08] so he told that little boy he said son
[51:10] just put me where the
[51:12] let me get a hold that pillar
[51:17] he said is the other one on the other
[51:18] side yeah
[51:20] he said okay son you leave
[51:24] right i believe he did i believe he said
[51:26] son
[51:27] you get out of here
[51:29] something can happen
[51:32] go down and run my hand through locks on
[51:34] my hair
[51:35] i'm ready to die with my enemy
[51:40] the great thing
[51:44] if i ever get to teaching i'm going to
[51:45] start preaching
[51:49] i love to preach
[51:50] without even notes or anything you know
[51:54] if you see here all i got this written
[51:55] down stuff
[51:58] but listen
[52:02] we see that one day finally
[52:05] mary
[52:06] got a revelation
[52:09] and she said
[52:11] be it unto me according to thy word
[52:15] even though an angel spoke to her
[52:18] i didn't make it come to pass
[52:23] she said be it unto me according to that
[52:24] word
[52:27] a child was born
[52:29] but you
[52:30] know now listen
[52:34] that child couldn't die for my sins or
[52:36] yours
[52:38] even though that was the seed of the
[52:40] woman
[52:42] right
[52:44] he couldn't die when he was a year old
[52:46] two years old five years old
[52:48] he couldn't die when he was over there
[52:49] in the temple at somewhere between 12 13
[52:52] 14 whatever you want to make him
[52:58] but he could begin to understand
[53:02] how would you like to read the scrolls
[53:04] in the bible
[53:07] and when you read it you begin to
[53:08] understand
[53:12] that's talking about me
[53:15] we love the good ones don't we
[53:19] right
[53:20] we love the promises the good ones
[53:23] but what about the
[53:28] the things that are the natural part of
[53:29] the book we were talking about this
[53:31] morning
[53:32] you know it shows how dirty we are and
[53:34] what wrong we are and what we've done
[53:36] what we need to get rid of
[53:40] but you know after all is said and done
[53:46] let's see who was it david
[53:49] when god offered him said you can do
[53:50] this
[53:52] you can do that
[53:53] you can take this
[53:55] he offered him there one time remember
[53:57] he'd done wrong
[53:59] and he said whatever you desire will be
[54:01] given to you
[54:04] david said
[54:06] put me in the hands
[54:10] of god
[54:13] in other words god you decide
[54:16] that's just plain talking you know god
[54:18] you decide what it's going to be
[54:21] he could have been offered a lot of
[54:22] things he was but he said you just
[54:25] whatever
[54:27] because he knew
[54:28] in the hands of god he'd be better off
[54:31] than all the other things he could think
[54:32] about doing
[54:38] judgment is not too bad when you think
[54:39] that way
[54:42] but you see
[54:45] the words of a woman
[54:49] that had a virgin mind virgin womb
[54:56] brought forth
[54:57] the seed of the woman
[55:00] all right
[55:02] bringing forth that seed of the woman i
[55:04] said he couldn't die right there
[55:08] yet he was there
[55:10] proclaimed
[55:12] to be almighty god
[55:15] but when he was there at the temple he
[55:17] couldn't die
[55:18] but he could he begin then to see
[55:21] what would take place
[55:24] he gets down on the river jordan
[55:30] and he becomes as the prophet says the
[55:32] fullness of the godhead bodily
[55:34] what does that mean
[55:36] well he wasn't god didn't he become god
[55:38] now where'd you get that idea
[55:43] you didn't get it out of the bible and
[55:44] you didn't get it from the prophet
[55:46] now you must have got it somewhere else
[55:49] and i'd say it's downstairs
[55:53] all right
[55:55] no boogerman's idea
[55:59] but you see he begins to realize
[56:03] after he's anointed there on the river
[56:05] jordan
[56:07] he realizes that that's fulfilling of
[56:09] the scripture
[56:13] he gets over there and he's talking one
[56:15] day and he said
[56:16] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[56:19] because he has anointed me to preach the
[56:21] gospel
[56:23] that's wonderful that he began to see
[56:25] that
[56:26] but you know what else began to be
[56:27] revealed to him
[56:30] every time he'd read i read
[56:34] the psalmist
[56:36] they pierced my hands and my feet
[56:38] see we only deal with this day this
[56:40] scripture is fulfilled at one point
[56:42] but every time he read them scriptures
[56:44] he knew where he was walking that's
[56:46] right
[56:49] he knew that he was going to die
[56:54] now that i've ever always tried to
[56:56] explain
[56:57] you know we got the only religion in the
[56:58] world
[57:00] that our god had to die
[57:02] show me another one anywhere
[57:05] any other religion
[57:07] that is dependent upon the death of
[57:09] their god
[57:11] everybody else is in the life of their
[57:13] god you know
[57:15] but our whole dependence is upon whether
[57:18] or not
[57:19] he was god or not
[57:22] that's why i argue with those brothers
[57:23] hard about saying he wouldn't go until
[57:25] the river jordan well who was he
[57:29] and if the anointing left him who did he
[57:31] become and what happened to him
[57:35] because you see that wasn't the god that
[57:36] i'm talking about that's said in the
[57:38] garden i'll go with you
[57:43] and it'll take me 4 000 years of types
[57:46] and shadows
[57:48] and promises
[57:51] i said one day
[57:53] it'll come into reality
[57:57] one day i'll stand on this earth
[58:02] he goes through many things in his life
[58:06] horrible life
[58:07] all he ever done was good
[58:10] i never could understand that as a
[58:12] baptist i used to read the bible i
[58:13] thought god how is this
[58:15] this man never done nothing but good
[58:20] and they killed him for being good
[58:26] see i couldn't understand
[58:28] they didn't kill him that's right
[58:31] the other day no they didn't kill him
[58:34] he gave his life
[58:39] there was no way to take his life
[58:43] there was no way to kill even that
[58:45] physical man standing there
[58:48] until god said it can be done
[58:51] amen you want to pro quo to the prophet
[58:53] satan can't get you until god is through
[58:56] with you
[59:00] we listened to him another day there and
[59:02] he said
[59:03] there you was you come up to about
[59:04] somewhere 18 20 years old said god took
[59:06] a picture
[59:08] said you got married and said you want
[59:09] to he said god took a picture
[59:14] said he turned around to the devil and
[59:15] said okay satan
[59:17] get after him
[59:19] that's where he said it
[59:22] said take him down but said you can't
[59:24] take his life
[59:26] until i tell you
[59:29] well
[59:30] i can't die until he tells the devil
[59:33] you can have him
[59:36] death is my
[59:37] not my master it's my slave
[59:41] but listen
[59:42] see the mystery
[59:45] of the entire bible of the plan of
[59:47] redemption
[59:51] is the fact
[59:52] that somebody is going to have to die
[59:57] to give you something
[1:00:03] boys had to be the right kinsmen right
[1:00:06] but remember there was one closer ken
[1:00:08] than moaz
[1:00:10] right
[1:00:13] because we were kind of folks to the
[1:00:14] devil folks
[1:00:16] the new birth makes us ken folks to god
[1:00:22] but it would mean someone would have to
[1:00:24] come and die
[1:00:26] so now we see
[1:00:29] the predestinated plan of god
[1:00:32] as it comes into view
[1:00:36] that he would come down
[1:00:38] and live with you and i
[1:00:42] even in the sinful condition
[1:00:44] of a lost generation
[1:00:48] or genealogy or what you want to call it
[1:00:51] yet he would deal with us
[1:00:55] he would do everything he could to try
[1:00:56] to help us
[1:01:01] but then he knew he had to die
[1:01:06] he had to give his life
[1:01:09] because that was the only way that a
[1:01:11] redeemer could come he said no no no no
[1:01:13] wait a minute brother dale the birth
[1:01:15] gave a redeemer
[1:01:18] hey i got a little sense of dead
[1:01:21] okay i ask you a question why did jesus
[1:01:23] have to die
[1:01:27] okay
[1:01:29] he was standing there he was a redeemer
[1:01:31] why couldn't he just turn around there
[1:01:32] and say
[1:01:34] this is the way it is that's the way it
[1:01:35] is that's the way it is i'm going to
[1:01:36] speak it
[1:01:41] he was our redeemer
[1:01:43] he was the seat of the woman
[1:01:46] that's right
[1:01:48] why
[1:01:50] did they have to turn out the way it did
[1:01:54] he was dire
[1:01:57] to redeem
[1:01:59] right
[1:02:03] like everybody says in the message today
[1:02:04] you know always was eternal
[1:02:08] whether you didn't need jesus that's
[1:02:09] right right
[1:02:12] he said no then brothers ain't saying
[1:02:14] that well
[1:02:15] why don't you ask them
[1:02:18] you know that's the best way to know
[1:02:22] and really the best way to do is find
[1:02:24] somebody in their church and ask them
[1:02:26] don't ask them because they'll lie to
[1:02:27] you
[1:02:28] no brother i'm not saying that you can't
[1:02:31] show quote where i've ever said anything
[1:02:33] like that
[1:02:34] well why does the whole congregation
[1:02:35] believe it
[1:02:37] right
[1:02:40] then you let them stay there and believe
[1:02:42] it
[1:02:44] but listen
[1:02:46] god's
[1:02:47] predestinated
[1:02:51] plan
[1:02:54] now
[1:02:56] comes into view
[1:03:00] through the kinsman redeemer
[1:03:06] boaz didn't have to die
[1:03:10] right
[1:03:13] but why did this man have to die
[1:03:20] when he was a kinsman
[1:03:24] he was my brother
[1:03:31] but you see folks
[1:03:34] they had to be more to the story
[1:03:38] you and i were lost
[1:03:44] if he did not die he could have taken
[1:03:46] care of these bodies
[1:03:49] are you listening
[1:03:51] because he'd have been my brother
[1:04:00] but that didn't work
[1:04:03] because you got to start on the inside
[1:04:06] and work your way out
[1:04:12] he didn't have to die to make me to
[1:04:14] where i could have been like adam
[1:04:17] now are you listening in body
[1:04:21] because he could have stopped time
[1:04:24] and put us back in the garden
[1:04:28] i hope you're listening because i
[1:04:29] wondered how this was going to end up
[1:04:33] i told you what i like to preach instead
[1:04:35] of teach teach i got my notes down there
[1:04:37] i know what i'm going to say
[1:04:39] now i don't know what i'm gonna say
[1:04:44] he could have spoke it into existence
[1:04:46] and made the world back like adam do you
[1:04:48] believe that
[1:04:50] come on are you are you i mean do you
[1:04:51] believe it
[1:04:54] but you see that would only put us
[1:04:56] living
[1:04:57] without death in the body
[1:05:01] right
[1:05:03] come on did the prophet say that about
[1:05:05] adam said the tree of life was in the
[1:05:07] in the garden to remind adam that his
[1:05:08] youth was being renewed i think that's
[1:05:10] future home
[1:05:16] but you see folks
[1:05:18] he knew
[1:05:20] that that would put you like adam after
[1:05:22] the fall
[1:05:27] did you listen
[1:05:29] adam after the fall
[1:05:31] would be what jesus would have done had
[1:05:33] he spoke things into existence
[1:05:35] annihilated the devil by his words
[1:05:39] it wouldn't have put you back like adam
[1:05:41] really was in the beginning
[1:05:46] and that wouldn't have been his
[1:05:47] predestinated plan
[1:05:51] what was it predestinated plan
[1:06:00] sure number one to redeem mankind
[1:06:03] number two was to what
[1:06:06] reveal himself
[1:06:08] as
[1:06:09] savior
[1:06:11] healer
[1:06:13] redeemer
[1:06:16] god
[1:06:18] how many manifestations would you want
[1:06:19] to put there
[1:06:21] but you realize
[1:06:26] that that wasn't all of it
[1:06:30] you're gonna see these notes i got
[1:06:31] written down here but i really changed
[1:06:33] right there let's
[1:06:35] forget that page later on
[1:06:39] i'm trying to talk to you about the plan
[1:06:41] of redemption revealed
[1:06:48] but you see he knew inside of him
[1:06:50] was eternal life
[1:06:53] that you and i needed
[1:06:56] even though he could handle the flesh
[1:06:57] parts and speak into existence stop time
[1:07:00] and do whatever
[1:07:02] it would not put us back like adam
[1:07:06] because brother random on black feminist
[1:07:07] names what'd he say
[1:07:09] especially into adam
[1:07:11] he breathed into his nostrils
[1:07:15] the breath of life
[1:07:18] and he became a living soul
[1:07:22] with a living god
[1:07:26] eternal person he said
[1:07:31] right
[1:07:33] you see if you just live physically
[1:07:37] what good would that do this
[1:07:40] would he have been my brother
[1:07:43] he could have been my redeemer to stop
[1:07:45] death
[1:07:47] right
[1:07:52] but he wouldn't have been
[1:07:54] my savior
[1:07:58] he wouldn't have been my father
[1:08:01] he'd only been my brother
[1:08:05] so it was necessary that he died that's
[1:08:07] the mystery of what we're trying to
[1:08:09] bring out about the plan of redemption
[1:08:11] the mystery is that god would have to
[1:08:13] come in flesh
[1:08:16] don't worry about it because the next
[1:08:17] message we'll drop right back here start
[1:08:19] up and see how he come in flesh all
[1:08:21] right
[1:08:22] but he would have to
[1:08:25] die
[1:08:28] to release that life that was within him
[1:08:34] see if he released that life then he can
[1:08:36] be my savior
[1:08:39] he might have been my healer
[1:08:42] he might have been my brother
[1:08:46] but when that life come out
[1:08:48] he became a savior
[1:08:51] he became my father
[1:08:55] you remember
[1:08:56] he's the beginning of the creation of
[1:08:57] god do you remember what we're talking
[1:08:58] about wednesday night
[1:09:00] we are the continuation of that creation
[1:09:02] the prophet
[1:09:03] said amen
[1:09:07] so it wouldn't have been no bringing
[1:09:08] forth to the offsprings of god
[1:09:12] you see god's predestinated plan now
[1:09:14] comes into view
[1:09:20] because he could come down and live
[1:09:22] with us
[1:09:24] in jesus christ right
[1:09:27] but by giving that life
[1:09:30] he can live in us
[1:09:35] who the seed of the woman
[1:09:39] the seed of the woman
[1:09:43] the christ
[1:09:46] right amen
[1:09:50] by giving his life
[1:09:55] brother branham literally said it this
[1:09:56] way he said god
[1:09:58] tore the soul out of that body
[1:10:02] now what does it mean
[1:10:08] no he exodus out of him didn't he
[1:10:12] god was inside of that body right
[1:10:16] a body that has prepared me
[1:10:18] he exited out of that body
[1:10:21] at calvary
[1:10:24] right
[1:10:27] to be able to give you and i a new birth
[1:10:32] to where we could become the offspring
[1:10:33] of god
[1:10:36] see we're the offspring of god
[1:10:37] internally we're kin folks of the devil
[1:10:40] still out in the flesh whether you like
[1:10:41] that or not
[1:10:43] you tell me what you are
[1:10:45] oh my lineage is perfect well great
[1:10:49] that makes you confused to the devil in
[1:10:50] a pure form
[1:10:56] what else is going to make it
[1:11:00] i don't like the way you preach well
[1:11:01] good
[1:11:03] pray for me
[1:11:06] but is it the truth
[1:11:08] amen
[1:11:09] paul said i've overcome your enemy's got
[1:11:11] to tell you the truth
[1:11:15] but you see what i'm saying
[1:11:16] john the baptist
[1:11:19] they're
[1:11:20] speaking
[1:11:21] introduced him to the world
[1:11:24] and said what
[1:11:26] behold the lamb of god
[1:11:30] that takes away the sin of the world
[1:11:32] now what was he saying
[1:11:35] behold the woman's seed
[1:11:39] that will die
[1:11:43] to release his life
[1:11:47] and when he come out of the garden that
[1:11:48] was what he fully intended to do
[1:11:52] yet he couldn't live with us in his
[1:11:54] fullness
[1:11:55] and all the types we gave
[1:11:59] but one day he came in human flesh
[1:12:01] he could live with us
[1:12:03] but he still couldn't live in us
[1:12:07] it would take his death
[1:12:09] to make the ability for god to live in
[1:12:11] you and i
[1:12:13] right
[1:12:15] now
[1:12:16] let me just run on fire while we're at
[1:12:18] it
[1:12:21] because see god's predestinated plan
[1:12:23] doesn't end with this calvary
[1:12:29] it doesn't end on the day of pentecost
[1:12:34] god's predestinated plan doesn't end
[1:12:36] with you getting a new birth
[1:12:41] because you see he didn't speak these
[1:12:43] bodies back to
[1:12:46] not being old did he
[1:12:48] he didn't do that did he
[1:12:50] no because he knew what he was going to
[1:12:52] do
[1:12:53] he's going to come and live in us
[1:12:56] and by coming and living in us
[1:13:02] he could bring us to a place one day
[1:13:05] to be as the bible said it will be like
[1:13:07] unto him because with our bodies like
[1:13:08] unto his glorious body
[1:13:12] right
[1:13:13] right
[1:13:15] you see he made a way for everything
[1:13:18] all right
[1:13:19] see there remains one thing one mystery
[1:13:24] the mystery redemption of the new birth
[1:13:26] has been made known
[1:13:30] the mystery of the baptism of the holy
[1:13:32] ghost
[1:13:34] has been made known
[1:13:36] the mystery of eternal life to a human
[1:13:38] being
[1:13:40] has been made known and been made
[1:13:42] manifest
[1:13:43] by many believers
[1:13:47] but we're still facing death
[1:13:53] that's why i want that lamb to come in
[1:13:55] this day with the seven horns and seven
[1:13:57] eyes
[1:13:59] same lamb
[1:14:02] right
[1:14:03] same lamb that was on the river jordan
[1:14:06] behold the lamb of god is the same lamb
[1:14:08] i'm talking about this morning standing
[1:14:10] here in the end time in bright form
[1:14:14] right
[1:14:16] to fulfill
[1:14:17] revelations everywhere it talks about
[1:14:19] one like unto the son of man gird about
[1:14:21] the paps
[1:14:23] right in a feminist form in the bride
[1:14:28] but you see what he's got to do now he's
[1:14:29] got to come on the scene to be able to
[1:14:30] change these bodies
[1:14:38] our bodies were claimed
[1:14:42] listen
[1:14:44] your prophet covered i'm pretty sure
[1:14:45] it's future home
[1:14:48] he said when that blood of jesus christ
[1:14:51] dropped back on this earth
[1:14:54] it claimed our bodies
[1:14:57] because our bodies come out of this
[1:14:58] earth right
[1:15:00] so we're already claimed
[1:15:04] all right
[1:15:06] the day you get the new birth
[1:15:09] in the soul
[1:15:12] god lays claims of these bodies that's
[1:15:14] why we're not going to get a new body
[1:15:17] that's right
[1:15:19] it's done being claimed back there and
[1:15:21] he made the claim for sure
[1:15:23] when you came to live in this body
[1:15:26] and he gave you the new birth
[1:15:28] what are you going to need a new body
[1:15:30] for
[1:15:32] well this old body just ain't worth
[1:15:33] nothing that's right
[1:15:35] that's why he's going to redeem it
[1:15:39] adam was the top of it
[1:15:42] right
[1:15:43] just the type of it because in this day
[1:15:46] it's not going to be go back to just
[1:15:47] live forever
[1:15:51] or death do not take us it's going to go
[1:15:53] to glorified bodies
[1:15:56] all right
[1:15:58] see the kinsmen paid the price
[1:16:02] but he's got to come in this last days
[1:16:05] you notice what i read in the scripture
[1:16:09] until the redemption of the purchase
[1:16:12] possession
[1:16:15] now why would paul be so
[1:16:17] ignorant to think
[1:16:22] because he'd be ignorant if there wasn't
[1:16:24] something to happen in this day
[1:16:26] where he says in verse 14 which is the
[1:16:28] earnest of our inheritance
[1:16:30] until
[1:16:32] the redemption of the purchased
[1:16:34] possession
[1:16:35] under the praise of his glory
[1:16:39] this end time is promised
[1:16:43] not just eternal life
[1:16:46] not even just the face of the fathers
[1:16:51] he just promised a change of these
[1:16:53] bodies
[1:16:55] right
[1:16:57] i read around said why would you he said
[1:16:59] if i
[1:17:00] drop a book i picked the same book back
[1:17:02] up
[1:17:04] you know a lot of people still believe
[1:17:06] that they're going to get a new body in
[1:17:08] this message i have to brought around
[1:17:09] all the quotes
[1:17:12] and i i just got one to me that just
[1:17:14] seals it don't matter if i didn't even
[1:17:16] have a quote from brother brown
[1:17:17] when jesus raised he had nail press in
[1:17:19] his hands
[1:17:20] is that right
[1:17:22] the bible says put your finger here in
[1:17:24] my hand put it in my side
[1:17:27] well yet he was standing there in a
[1:17:28] glorified body
[1:17:30] i can't understand that brother dale i
[1:17:32] ain't asking you to understand it i'm
[1:17:34] asking you to believe it
[1:17:38] it's not to try to understand something
[1:17:41] it's to ask god for a revelation
[1:17:45] settles a lot of problems
[1:17:48] remember all that adam lost
[1:17:52] jesus christ came to restore
[1:17:57] adam lost the ability of this body to be
[1:18:00] made eternal
[1:18:02] he had eternal life within him
[1:18:05] but the coming forth of the christ
[1:18:08] seed of the woman
[1:18:10] in the second coming of christ
[1:18:15] what brother run say that was
[1:18:18] the bride coming out of the church
[1:18:21] what are you saying
[1:18:22] well i thought second coming from up to
[1:18:24] this guy coming up hey we're right we
[1:18:26] don't see it that way
[1:18:31] it's a secret
[1:18:33] mystery to the bride
[1:18:37] it's as i said this morning brother and
[1:18:39] said have we heard his voice
[1:18:42] through the opening of these seals
[1:18:47] and we heard his voice and we heard him
[1:18:49] calling her name
[1:18:51] or the revealing of the word unto us
[1:18:55] because that's going to conquer satan
[1:19:01] in the second coming of christ
[1:19:05] he's going to restore all things
[1:19:10] in the bride coming of christ
[1:19:13] is what your prophet said
[1:19:16] we saw then the redeemed kinsman
[1:19:18] redeemer
[1:19:21] he not only died
[1:19:23] but what's the point
[1:19:26] he not only died
[1:19:30] to pay the prices
[1:19:32] he rose again
[1:19:37] so that everybody else that would be in
[1:19:38] the grave would have the ability to come
[1:19:40] out
[1:19:41] right
[1:19:43] heroes
[1:19:44] if i go i can raise
[1:19:48] all right
[1:19:53] but he walked into eternal life
[1:19:57] because he was raised in eternal life
[1:20:01] and that ain't all the story
[1:20:05] he went up in a rapture
[1:20:09] right
[1:20:10] you don't know who was made eternal he
[1:20:12] went up in a rapture
[1:20:13] so that seals it for all of us
[1:20:17] but around said he'll become visible
[1:20:19] among us
[1:20:20] raise the dead and we'll go in the
[1:20:23] rapture
[1:20:26] and that's not a corporal coming
[1:20:29] because he doesn't come corporally
[1:20:30] physically until the millennium
[1:20:33] we meet him in the air
[1:20:35] in the same body he's in
[1:20:38] all right
[1:20:40] see the plan of redemption
[1:20:45] the full plan of redemption
[1:20:49] these bodies has got to be redeemed he
[1:20:51] said it's already done it's already done
[1:20:53] but it ain't took possession
[1:20:55] amen
[1:20:57] now back up just a second what we read
[1:20:59] right at the lights this morning
[1:21:02] he's got to stay on that mercy seat
[1:21:04] until that last person
[1:21:06] is born again
[1:21:08] right
[1:21:09] and when he does he'll leave the mercy
[1:21:11] seat oh no he left it back under
[1:21:15] well he was dead then
[1:21:18] that's what he said you're dead and lost
[1:21:22] but he'll come forth in this last days
[1:21:24] the prophet said visible
[1:21:26] then say physical is it visible
[1:21:30] among us
[1:21:32] we'll raise you raise the dead
[1:21:34] and we'll go in the rapture
[1:21:37] that's a promise
[1:21:40] we've got many promises
[1:21:42] to wait until we can see him
[1:21:49] have you heard
[1:21:51] his voice
[1:21:53] through the opening of the word
[1:21:55] what other voice would you want to hear
[1:21:57] an audible
[1:22:00] an audible
[1:22:03] satan can impersonate that remember
[1:22:09] like the old fella told he said
[1:22:12] the boys wondered about whether he was
[1:22:13] called to preach or not
[1:22:15] so he decided to
[1:22:17] have him out he crawled up in a tree
[1:22:18] outside the road and a guy come walking
[1:22:20] by and he said john
[1:22:23] he stopped
[1:22:24] but john said you called to preach
[1:22:29] he said you know that guy's been
[1:22:30] preaching 50 years and how could i tell
[1:22:32] him now that it wouldn't god
[1:22:34] all right
[1:22:36] how do we know god didn't use that
[1:22:41] but do you understand
[1:22:42] the plan of redemption
[1:22:46] and it still involves
[1:22:50] predestination and remember the quotes
[1:22:52] the other day
[1:22:54] brother around and said he predestinated
[1:22:56] a seed
[1:22:58] for each age
[1:23:02] and he predestinated a people
[1:23:05] to live that age
[1:23:10] then he still knows before knowledge
[1:23:13] we just don't live before knowledge
[1:23:19] we better start living by predestination
[1:23:21] instead of some foreign knowledge well
[1:23:23] if i was saved i'll be saved
[1:23:26] no
[1:23:28] the bible says let the redeemed say so
[1:23:34] the bible says to confess
[1:23:37] right right
[1:23:39] well if i'm predestinated
[1:23:43] it's a good thing
[1:23:45] but it just won't hold true folks
[1:23:49] you won't hold true for the hour
[1:23:52] you and i are supposed to be
[1:23:54] to a place
[1:23:59] that we believe what god says
[1:24:03] and even doubt our own doubts
[1:24:06] in other words doubt our own great
[1:24:08] revelations that we've got
[1:24:17] where are we standing
[1:24:20] let's stand we're ready for the
[1:24:22] communion
[1:24:26] brothers
[1:24:27] you ready
[1:24:31] ready for the communion the time
[1:24:34] that we can really
[1:24:37] you know what the prophet said communion
[1:24:40] is to communicate
[1:24:41] so we talk to god he talks to us
[1:24:44] we communicate
[1:24:47] then we have a physical communion
[1:24:49] that we do once a month
[1:24:52] always be in the first sunday of the
[1:24:54] month
[1:24:58] and then that's what i like to do with
[1:25:00] communion on the watch night service
[1:25:03] you know let everybody else hoop law and
[1:25:05] do what they want to the first of the
[1:25:07] year
[1:25:09] we just take the communion
[1:25:12] and then we go downstairs because it's
[1:25:14] always
[1:25:15] plenty to eat you don't have to go home
[1:25:17] or run the waffle house or danny calls
[1:25:19] them awful house
[1:25:22] you don't have to go to them
[1:25:24] we just sit down and eat and have a good
[1:25:26] time together
[1:25:29] in a new year
[1:25:32] you know what a new dear means or a new
[1:25:34] day means
[1:25:35] it means more of god's word is to be
[1:25:37] revealed
[1:25:40] right
[1:25:42] made known unto us in the plan of
[1:25:43] redemption
[1:25:46] forever received of the lord that which
[1:25:47] also i delivered unto you
[1:25:49] that the lord jesus the same night in
[1:25:51] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:25:53] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:25:55] and said take eat this is my body which
[1:25:57] is broken for you just do in remembrance
[1:26:00] of me
[1:26:01] after the same manner also he took the
[1:26:03] cup when he had slept saying this cup is
[1:26:06] the new testament in my blood this due
[1:26:08] year as often as you drink it in
[1:26:10] remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:26:12] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:26:14] you the lord's death till he come
[1:26:16] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:26:18] and drink this cup of the lord
[1:26:19] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:26:22] and blood of the lord but let a man
[1:26:24] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:26:25] that bread and drink of that cup
[1:26:28] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:26:29] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[1:26:32] to himself
[1:26:33] not discerning the lord's body
[1:26:35] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:26:37] among you and many sleep
[1:26:39] where we would judge ourselves we should
[1:26:40] not be judged
[1:26:42] but when we are judged we are chastened
[1:26:44] to the lord that we should not be
[1:26:46] condemned with the world i thank god for
[1:26:48] that scripture
[1:26:50] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:26:52] together to eat
[1:26:54] tarry one for another
[1:26:56] and if any man any man hunger
[1:26:59] let him eat at home that you come not
[1:27:01] together into condemnation
[1:27:03] rest while i sit in order when i come
[1:27:05] he brought around and said paul was
[1:27:06] saying that because
[1:27:08] they were just getting together
[1:27:10] and eating a meal
[1:27:12] you know
[1:27:14] and there was more of the meal than
[1:27:15] there was the communion
[1:27:18] you know
[1:27:19] there was they just get together and eat
[1:27:23] well that's not exactly the way it is
[1:27:26] there's even people in this message that
[1:27:28] won't eat eat after taking communion i'm
[1:27:30] not going to fuss with them i mean that
[1:27:32] day the rest of that day they won't eat
[1:27:34] anything i'm not going to fuss with them
[1:27:38] i'm just going to say it
[1:27:40] it's never been made known to me to do
[1:27:41] it that way
[1:27:43] so
[1:27:44] we take the communion if you take it in
[1:27:46] the morning in the evening or night
[1:27:48] whatever
[1:27:49] it's to take in a communion not whether
[1:27:51] or not i'm eating or doing whatever the
[1:27:53] rest of the day
[1:27:55] there's people that will not eat
[1:27:57] on the grounds of a church
[1:28:00] because they believed that brother ryan
[1:28:01] said those things
[1:28:04] well
[1:28:06] that's all right that's their business
[1:28:08] that ain't lula
[1:28:11] you know
[1:28:13] i'd like it to be worth it we had a
[1:28:14] fellowship hall built off to itself yes
[1:28:17] but we can't afford it so we got one in
[1:28:18] the church and why go build another one
[1:28:20] somewhere else now
[1:28:26] it's just going like it is
[1:28:28] big old brother i told you about it he
[1:28:30] was coming in the door he used to be
[1:28:31] right here opened the doors and brought
[1:28:33] in the communion trays and this big old
[1:28:35] brother in the message
[1:28:37] he said brother dale he was preaching
[1:28:39] that sunday
[1:28:40] he said brother dale he said
[1:28:43] all the believers
[1:28:45] use one cup
[1:28:47] i just opened the door and walked on in
[1:28:48] and i said we believe part of it
[1:28:52] i just went off
[1:28:54] i wouldn't go to hearken with him
[1:28:57] i said brother mo what did he do at the
[1:28:58] tabernacle he said he had many cups
[1:29:01] that's okay thank you
[1:29:03] you know
[1:29:06] but yet you can find a quote where
[1:29:07] brother brown said he would like one cup
[1:29:09] baby
[1:29:10] and that's all right
[1:29:12] i'm not going to argue and fuss with
[1:29:13] nobody
[1:29:15] that's just what i am
[1:29:17] you know

[1:29:23] i'll tell you where i stand
[1:29:26] okay
[1:29:28] but the bible said here that they target
[1:29:29] one for another so let's just pray a
[1:29:30] little bit
[1:29:32] silently before the lord
[1:29:34] before we go into this communion
[1:29:53] or just forgive our sins cleanse us
[1:29:56] of all unrighteousness make us worthy to
[1:29:59] partake of this communion
[1:30:01] in jesus name
[1:30:03] amen
[1:30:05] the bible said it he took bread and he
[1:30:06] blessed it
[1:30:08] father we thank you for this bread it
[1:30:09] was made for this purpose today
[1:30:12] and we thank you for it we ask you now
[1:30:14] that you just sanctify it and sanctify
[1:30:16] the partakers that we may all be one
[1:30:19] together in you
[1:30:20] in jesus name amen
[1:30:37] you know we don't have a
[1:30:40] promise that we're going to be around
[1:30:41] here eternally
[1:30:45] so
[1:30:48] nanny just let lisa step up
[1:30:51] some of them and they're
[1:30:53] they're making the bread a lot of times
[1:30:56] well that's good
[1:30:58] because we need the ones to be ready
[1:31:01] in case
[1:31:03] you know
[1:31:04] god is preparing a way for all of us and
[1:31:06] he'll make a way
[1:31:08] it's not that we're guaranteed to stay
[1:31:10] around here
[1:31:12] we're not
[1:31:13] i'm guaranteed one thing
[1:31:16] every what it is i he wants me to do i
[1:31:18] won't do it
[1:31:20] you know
[1:31:21] i want to walk in the light of his love
[1:31:23] and just
[1:31:24] follow after it
[1:31:26] no matter what it costs or what's going
[1:31:28] on
[1:31:29] and i can just say well lord you just
[1:31:31] have your way
[1:31:33] let us be what you want us to be
[1:31:38] can you say amen
[1:31:45] father we thank you for this wine and we
[1:31:47] know that it's made for the purpose
[1:31:49] of taking the communion and we pray that
[1:31:51] you would just bless each one lord
[1:31:54] as we partake
[1:31:56] the bread is a symbol of your body
[1:31:59] it is not your body it's a symbol of it
[1:32:01] the wine is a symbol of your blood it's
[1:32:03] not your blood it's just a symbol
[1:32:06] but we get to do these things while
[1:32:07] we're here
[1:32:09] and we realize the reason we can do this
[1:32:11] here we've ate of your body
[1:32:13] through the opening of the word
[1:32:15] we've drank of your spirit through the
[1:32:16] quickening of the holy ghost to reveal
[1:32:19] yourself unto us so we really know what
[1:32:21] the communion's all about then it is
[1:32:23] truly a communion
[1:32:25] is talking and listening
[1:32:27] to our lord and savior

[1:32:44] by the river
[1:32:48] i'll rest me
[1:32:50] the ever
[1:32:52] green tree
[1:32:55] i'll carry
[1:32:58] my cross
[1:33:00] through the midnight
[1:33:04] come morning
[1:33:06] there's glory
[1:33:08] for me
[1:33:11] sometimes i'm
[1:33:13] despised
[1:33:15] and rejected
[1:33:18] and i question
[1:33:21] father
[1:33:23] how long
[1:33:26] then i take one
[1:33:28] more
[1:33:30] at mount calvary
[1:33:34] and it gives me
[1:33:36] the strength to
[1:33:38] go
[1:33:41] come morning
[1:33:43] i'll walk
[1:33:45] by the river
[1:33:49] i'll rest me
[1:33:51] the ever
[1:33:53] green tree
[1:33:56] i'll carry

[1:34:04] come mourn
[1:34:07] there's glory
[1:34:09] for me
[1:34:12] you know to be able to just understand
[1:34:16] i always think about it even though the
[1:34:18] great apostles were used and even though
[1:34:22] as we were talking about this morning
[1:34:23] about john
[1:34:24] and his prophetic realm
[1:34:26] but you know
[1:34:27] it's always something personal to
[1:34:29] everybody
[1:34:31] john wasn't chosen to explain the
[1:34:33] communion
[1:34:35] that was left for the apostle paul
[1:34:40] paul came forth and explained it
[1:34:43] he could pick up those types and shadows
[1:34:46] and bring it forth
[1:34:48] and he could see what went on
[1:34:52] everybody's got a job to do
[1:34:55] let's just do our job
[1:35:00] fill in the pew
[1:35:02] singing a song
[1:35:03] playing an instrument
[1:35:06] whatever
[1:35:08] just
[1:35:09] be what was supposed to be
[1:35:12] and that way god can honor it
[1:35:15] and manifest itself
[1:35:17] right
[1:35:32] um
[1:36:02] let's all protect together
[1:36:15] you can be seated till we get
[1:36:19] everything prepared
[1:36:23] you'd like to turn in your scripture
[1:36:24] turn to john 13.
[1:36:29] supper being ended the devil having now
[1:36:31] put into the heart of judas's carrot
[1:36:32] simon's son to betray him
[1:36:34] jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:36:36] all things into his hands that he was
[1:36:37] come from god and went to god
[1:36:40] he rises from supper and laid aside his
[1:36:42] garments
[1:36:43] and took a towel inverted himself
[1:36:46] after that he poured water into a basin
[1:36:48] and began to wash the disciples feet
[1:36:51] and to wipe them with a towel wherewith
[1:36:53] he was girded then cometh he to simon
[1:36:55] peter and peter said unto him lord lest
[1:36:57] i wash my feet
[1:37:00] jesus answered and said unto him
[1:37:02] what i do thou knowest not now but thou
[1:37:05] shalt know
[1:37:06] hereafter
[1:37:08] peter saith unto him thou shalt never
[1:37:10] wash my feet
[1:37:11] jesus answered him if i wash thee not
[1:37:13] die has no part with me
[1:37:16] simon peter saith unto him lord
[1:37:18] not my feet only but also my hands in my
[1:37:21] head
[1:37:22] jesus saith unto him he that is washed
[1:37:24] needeth not saved to wash his feet
[1:37:27] but he's clean ever wit and you're clean
[1:37:29] but not all
[1:37:30] for in you who should betray him
[1:37:32] therefore said he ye are not all clean
[1:37:36] so after he had washed their feet and
[1:37:38] had taken his garments and was set down
[1:37:40] again he said unto them

[1:37:44] you call me master and lord and you say
[1:37:46] well for so i am if i then your lord and

[1:37:54] feet for i've given you an example
[1:37:57] that you should do as i have done to you
[1:37:59] verily verily i say unto you the servant
[1:38:01] is not greater than his lord
[1:38:03] neither he that is sent greater than he
[1:38:05] that sent him
